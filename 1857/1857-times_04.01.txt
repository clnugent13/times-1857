City Commission Of Sewers.-Yesterday a
CrFY COMnsSxON or SEwEIvs.-Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business. Mr. Deputy Peacock occupied the chair. The report of the Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Letheby) had reference to the condition of 113 houses which had been inspected during the week, and which required the orders of the Court for sanitary improvement. The report stated that there were 75 deaths returned during the week. This number is a little over the average, but it embraces several deaths which have been the subjects of inquiry before the coroner during the last three months, and which are included in his quarterly return. Of these deaths there were 30 among children of less than 5 years of age, and 15 among persons of 60 and upwards. The chief causes of death were disease of the respiratory organs, as 10 from bronchitis, 10 from phthisis, 5 from pneumonia, and 3 fr in whoopillgcough. Besides these there were 10 from the convulsions of infancy and 9 from violence. There was but one death from fever, and there were none from smallpox or scarlet fever.

The Elections.
THE
ELECTIONS.,
ROTITWATR
The offical declaration of the poll was rade yesterday at the Town-hall, St. Xargaretiahill. Some thousands of persons assembled, buit, owing to the exoelentarrangements of the High Bailiff, who was efficivntly supported by Super. intendent Branford of the If division of police, everything passed off quietly, and no discomfort was experienoed by any one.
The HY.GY BA1IFF 5staed that the result of the poling bad been carefully examined, and he declared the choioe of the electors to have fallen upon Sir C. Napier and Mr. John Locke, the numbers being for
Napier ... ... ... ... ... 3,991 Locke ... ... ... ... ... 3,647 Pellatt ... ... ... ... ... 2,499
Sir a. N"ia then presented himuelf, and was received with hearty applause. He expressed hic simere thanks for the honour which bad been conferreApon him by his election for the second time as mneir for Southwark, At the last election attempts bad beenmade by an unworthy ang to crush him, but the people of Southwark we-e determined that he should not be crushed, and by voting for him on that occasion they had exhibited at once their
hatred of oppression and their love of fair play. (Cheers})a Now again, after time hsd been afforded them for reflection, they came forward and maintained their choice, and re-elected him member for Southiwark. Be trusted that he should justify that choice, and that he should do his duty in Parliarment to their satisfaction and to his ow honour. (Cheers.) They all knew well enough that the duties of a member of Parliament were by no means light; in fact, they were exoessively severe. Many members prided themselves upon being present at every divisicn, but divisions often took place upon trivial questions, and he was inclined to look rather at the quality than the quantity of the votes which a member gave. (Cheers.) It was imposslble for a man to be at every division, he must take his rest occasionally, and he must have his dinner sometimes; but, speaking for himself, he believed tat he had not been absent upon any divsion of the slightest importance, exoept that on the ballot, w hen he bad been shut out of the Hous, as he had previously explained. (Cheers.) He laud nov to make a statement wshich he thought would astonish them not a little, and that wa that Commisioner Yeh was a greater re;ormer than any of them. (Cheers and a laugh.) Yeh had made the leading men in this country dissolve Parliament, and it was notorious that until the dissolution not one of them had thought a word about reform. He trusted now not only that we should have Locke King's motion carried, but that there would be an end to the rotten borough system-that we should have a large extenbion of the suffge and the ballot to protect it. He thought, indeed, that Parliamentary reform might be looked upon as achieved, because, although long sleeping, the question had now been revived, and he believed that there would be Each a pressure upon the Minister as would make the measure irresistible. (Cheers.) He quite agreed with Lord John Russell in the propriety of reducing the duties upon tea and sugar-the luxuries as well as the necessaries 'of worldng men; he was also in favour of a diminution of the public expenditure, but he would not so reduce it as to cripple the defen,ces of the State, or to leave this great country at the mercy of any other nation. (Cheers.) Frsnce was now our ally, but the French were an ambitious and a vainsas well aS a gallaut people. He remembered vwith satisfaction the share which they had taken with him in the Baltic, and the enste cord-ine-never disturboed-betwveen Admiral Duchesne and himself; but he could not forget that, while we were a free nation, in France there existed only the apology for freedom, and that an alliance between people so dissimilar in their habits might be broken in a day; he was therefore in favour of maintaining our defenoes in an efficientstate. (Cheers.) Mr. Tierney had said, "Give mea full exchequer and a well-ranned navy, and I will defy the world." He quite concurred in that sentiment, and he would never advocate a recurrence to that miserable economy wbich would expose us to the attack of more ambitious nations than ourselves. Tne Titnes, in a very humorous article, had referred to a neighbouring mnember as having resisted the blandishments of the Court, and even the offer of a title. Now, it was not likely that he (Sir Charles Napier) would ever be offered a title; but he had resisted one blandishment, and that was the offer of a G.C B. He had refused it because he thought it was adecorationwhich would confer no distinction upon him, and in order to mark his contempt of those who offend it. The gallant admiral added that of course he did not mean this expression to apply to the Sovereign, the fountain of honour, for whom he proposed three cheers, as the good queen, the good wife, and the good maother.
The proposition met with so hearty a response as to establish the loyalty of the Southwarkians beyond dispute.
Mr. LocEE said that if Sir Charles Napier were grateful for the honour which had been conferred upon him, how much more must he (Mr. Locke) be, who, in comparison with that gallant admiral,.was an untried man. He had had no doubt from the commencement that his views were in perfect coincidence with their own; and it was most gratifying for him to find that he possessed their entire con6dence, and that he should have an opportunity while eliminating their sentiments of giving utterance to those o fiaous which he had himself long cherished. (Cheers. His gallant colleague had referred to France, and it was somewhat remarkable that one of the most distinguished writers of the present day-Dumashad been on the spot during the whole of their public proceedings, in order that he might ascertain how English popular elections were conducted. M. Dumas had commumeated his ideas to the Parisian journal La Prasse, and they were to be found, full of interest and instraction, translated in some of the London newspapers of that morning. Mir. Locke then went through the principal points of his address, and vindicated the cause of the lawyers, referring to Tierney, W. Brougham, and D. W. Harvey as lawyers whom the borough had at different times returned as their representatives. He repeated the expression of his perfect independence, and declared that, going now to the House of Commons for the first time, he should forget all party cries, and that he should consider himself as the representative of every man in the borough who had any right to assert or any claim to urge. (Cheers.)
Mr. PELLATT next presented himself, and although there was evidently a strong feeling against him on the part of the crowd, the frank manner in which he extended his hand to the successful candidates conciliated some of his more demonstrative opponents. They were too generous, I e was sure, he said, not to give a fair hearing to a defeated candidate. He respected the constituency of Southwark, he respected their choice upon this occason, and he bowed with complacency and submission to the election which had just taken place. He had, however, always thought that one commercial representative was essential to Southwark, and, having been five years in their service, I'aving spent much labour, time, and money in their cause, having originated many useful measures in Parliament, having been constant in his attendance, having been always accessible to his constituents, and having vidicated on all occasions the great cause of civil and religiors liberty, he had hoped that he, an old servant, would not have been dismissed to make way for a new and untried man. (Cheers and uproar.) EHe vindicated his vote on the Chinese question, declaring it to be "a crowning act of humanity," in which he gloried. He quoted from M M. Chevalier a grateful testimony to the religious feeling of the British people, trusted that the English sabbath would always be preserved intact, and expressed a hope, in conclusion, that the cry of 'Pellatt and Locke" would never again be heard in antaponisu, hut that they would be *- locked" in a bond of Christian union and national patriotism for the benefit of their common country. (Cheess.)
On the motion of Sir C. Ns.rrxa, seconded by Mr. LocKE, and supported by IVr. PELLATT, a vote of thanks, most eminently due, was passed to the High Bailiff.
Mr. PRrrcHARD acknowledged in becoming terms the compliment. He expressed the gratification which he had experienced in presiding over such an intelligent body of the inhabitants of Southwaar'. He thanked theni for the order which they had preserved, and stated that the manner in which the electors had exercised their suffrage, coupled with the extraordinary supporb which had been afforded them by the non-electors, supplied to him the strongest reasons which it was possible to adduce in favour of a great extension of the fraichise.
The proceedings then terminated.
LAMBETH.
The official declaration ofthe numbers was made yesterday morning at 11. A long train of carriages attended Mr. Roupell to the hustings, and his supporters mustered there very numerously. Mr. Williams, the other successful candidate, and Mfr. W}kinson were also present, attended by their friends.'
The RrTuiNcG OrcEB (Mr. H. Onslow) announced the numbers to be as follows:-
Roupell . .. . .. ... 9,318 Williams ... ... ... ..7,W Wilkinson... . 3,234
This gives to Mr. Roupell a majority of 1,670 over Mr. Williams, and one of 6,084 over Mr. Wilkinson, while Mr. Williams has over the defeated candidate a majority of 4,414. At the last general election in 1852 Mr. Wilkinson (who was then at the head of the poll) received 4,732 votes;
Mx. Williams, 4,022; and Mr. D'Eyncourt. 3,829. Mr. Roupell has therefore polled at this election nearly twice as many votes as were given to the most popular of the two late members.
TheRETVRNING OFFicEE having declared Mr. Roupell and Mr. Williams duly elected to represent the borough of Lambeth in Parliament,
Mr. RorPicLL addressed the crowd, tendering to the electors his warmest tbank-s for the manner in which they had supported him on this great occasion, and had placed him in the proud position of their representative by a larger majority than had ever been given to any one member in this country. (Cheers.) This was a glorious triumph-the triumph of liberty and truth over the modern %stem of timeserving and hypocrisy. ("IOh!" and cheers.) He was not unduly puffed up by bis position. He gloried in it, it was true; but it occasioned him grave considerations. He was fully aware of the tremendous responsibility now devolving upon him, and this reflection cast an air of gravity and of religious feeling over his mind which he boped would never forsake him. (Hear, hear.)
The next Parliament would be an historical Parliament. Subjects would be brought before that House of the greatest importance to them and to futurity, both in regard to our foreign relations and to domestic politics. He need not say that he would give his earnest attention to these matters, *ed that he would devote himself to their interestsandtothoseof his country. (Cheers.) Andnow he would allude to a subject not quite so agreeable. This election up to a certain period was conducted in a munner
reflecting credit upon every one concerned iL Yesterday, however, for the first time, at about 2 or 3 o'clock. when Mr. Wilkinson was 2,000 or S,000 bebind, that gentlemau's agentr posted up a notice that l votes given or bio m (Mr. Roupell) were illegal;
that he had been guilty of grs briberya is oDmptioa
and, more thats, thty poiiel r4d , Weim ece to say that he had ,not a op,er q ifican. - Saegher.) Now, although he felt this is a peonal iasult,at Wale * an inslt offered to every free elctogr of "bi borough. (Cheer) H would enot offer a bribe to the poo L eIeeor amOnr them, becuse he was quite e it WOild, be $hro back in his fae with di sGt. o f s te expense of tlls election, he wAS hppy tQ sy t it wam much under the average, andhe eaiitrefected gre credit upon the borough that hey ad puthim to am enormous expenAe in ncotegther ettion. Any remarks upon tle bj t of xpenae cuse, mo ver, wit

He wouldak hetherit was not true that a the latelsetions, although lir. -ilkinson vas only before the electorsfor three da3s, that gentlem ent as much moneyms he (Mx. BRd-p_ hLad spent during e whole period cf hias present candidature? ("Oh, oh " and cheers.) Because Mr. W'1kinson wanted to be the poor -ans friend, wbat did he do? Why, ihe brought bread down in vans and sold a quartem loaf for a penny. (A. Voice.-"Ifs a lie; he didn't," and eonfusion.) One of Mr. Wilkinson's supporters had iven bim the lie direct, but he could afford to take it ufr 4ch a quarter, being prepared to make due allowanoe for the bitterfeelings of a disappoid candidate and lis friends. The idea of bnbery and corruption in afree borough like this must have been engendered in tile dark regions of ntter despair. (Cheers and laughter.) After obeerving thavt he felt lsush calumnlies more as it affected his brother electors than as it affected himself, the bon. gentleman concuded by saying that he looked forward with pleasure to meeng his constituents every year inorder to render them an account of his stewardship, and trusted that the AImighty would help him to be true to them and to represent their interests faithfully. (Loud cheers.
Mr. W. WILLAnIS was proud of the honourof addresing the electors of Lambeth for the third time as his constituents. He owed the position which he now occupied to the exertions of independent electors, and not to the efforts of paid or hired canvassers. In all parts of the borough friends of his had come forward to support him, becLuse they felt that in so doing they were supporting the great caunse of economy and reform. HIe himslf was only a humble though energetc instrument in earring out these important national objects. But what he was more proud of than even the honour of representing this borough wps, that the electors had sent him to the House of Commons free and independent; that they had not placed their member in the disgrul position of being tied to the car of a Minister, tobDaedraggeadtbrough any corruPtiOn which that Muinister chose to approve. {Cheers) Xe could only say that he would act as hehad hitherto acted-for their good and the good of his country,- and that DO other consideration should ever influence him in any vote he should give astheir renresentative. He hoped he should have opportunities of supporting Lord Palmerstonas Government, but the noble lord would only obtain that sapport if he brought forward good measures. (Hear, hear.) Lord Palmerston had promised a great deal, and it would be the duty of the next Parliament to endeavour to make him performn his promise His hon. colleague had just referred to certain proceedings which had taken place at this election. It had been his (Mr. Williass) most anxious desire to conduct the e'ection in a manner perfectly free from any ill-feeling whatever toward any candidate, and he had never said a word against his late colleague, who on this oocasion was his great opponent. On the other side, however, they had done all they possibly could to pick a hole in his politcal conduct, though they could bring nothing forward but vulgar ribaldry, which he could perfectly well afdford to laught at. (Cheers.) He thanked the electors Imostgratefully for the high honour they had con4erred upon him, and promised tnat not one of those who had
von him his vote should either be ashamed or should repent of having done so. (Cheers.)
MZ. WILKDSON was received with hisses and partial cheering. He said they had had the satisfaction of turning him out, and therefore they might as well hear him for a few minutes. Rx. Roupell had alluded to the notice which he had been advised to give, and had described this as an insult to the constitueney. lr. Boupell, however, had equally insulted the constituency by serving him with a precisely simil r notice. (Laughter and cheers.) He (Mr. Wilkinson) had been defeated, and the cause of that defeat he believed to be twofold. First of all, there had been a coalition against him (" Ho, no," and cheers); then, as they knew, there had been a very large expenditure of money; and, again, attempts had been made, not without sucoess, to prejudice the minds of the working classes against him. Calumnies had been uttered respecting him, many of which were untrue, a:.d statements of facts had been made to which an imroper colouring had been give These things had, ashe said, prejudiced against him the minds of the worldng classes, with regard to whom he was conscious that he had never done anything adverse to their interests, and that he had devoted much time and at. tention to the study of their condition and of their wants. (Bear, hear.) He did not envy the position of either of the successful candidates. It would have been his desire to be elected by the unbought suffrages of the electors. If he had not those unbought auffrageshe was contented to be without them; nor, again, would he submit to the humiiation or indignity of being brought in upon the skirts of another candidate. (Cries of "How about Harvey, then ?' and much interruption.) The electors had thought fit to return an untried man, who certainly promised very fairly, though in another sense he psoomised too much (a laugh); and they had taught him (Mr. Wilkinson) one lesson which he was sorry to learn; they had shalken his faith in large constituencies, because they had proclaimed to the world that among such constituencies the man with the longest purse was sure to win the battle. ("No !"and confusion.) Mr. Roupell might turn out to be a Priae, and might serve themfa2thfuUyand diligently, as hebelievedlhenhself had done; but if this were so, and at theend of the ne-tParliament a richer man came forward,no matter who, the electors would turn Mr. Roupell out, if he had served them ever so faithfully. (" No, no !") This would be the consequence whenever constituencies forgot long tried services and fastened their faith upon nevw favourites without sufficient regard to what they had done or what they were likely to perform. He (Mr. Wilkinson) had never given a vote in his life which he did not believe to be for the good of the working classes. He anc they might differ as to the mode of benefiting them. For example, they often asl-ed for Acts of Parliament to remedy their condition which would really do them more harm than good; andthen he had felt bound to vote against such measures. In conclusion, he hoped the electors would not be disappointed in the new member they had chosen, and trusted that that gentleman would fulfil their highest expectations.
The proceedings closed with three cheers for the Queen and a vote of thanks to the returning officer.
BERKSHrRE.
(FROM OUsR OWN RtPOPvxa.)
The nomination for knights of the shire took place yesterday at Abingdon. It had been anticipated that there would be no opposition to the return of Sessrs. Roberr Palmer and Vansittrt, the late members, and of lir. Bouverie in the place of Lord Barrington, who had declined to allov himself again to be placed in nomincation; but at the eleventh hour a new candidate appeared in the person of Captain Vernon, late MLP. for Chatham
After the usual prelimmaries,
Mr. WRouGooN proposed M1r. Robert. Palmer; the nomination was seconded by Mr. BARKER.
'.n MoUvT proposed Mr. Vansittart; the nomination was seconded by Mr. Tur
Mdr. Eixs proposed the Hon. P. Bouverie.
Mr. MoNcst seconded the nomination, and, in the course of a few observations, confessed himself unable to understand what was meant by the term "Liberal Conserva. tive."
Mr. SToNx proposed Captain Leicester Vernon, and the nomination was seconded by Mr. LousLEY.
Mr. I. PALmER then cameforward and wasreceived with loud cheers. He said that it was not the lot of many men to have served the same constitLency for 32 years in succession. (Cheers) He had sat for that county in 10 Parliaments, and he hoped that in that time he had not mads many enemies (' No, no !"), nor lost any friends. (Hear.) He ventured to hope so from the numerous marks of favoar and approbation which had been bestowed upon him, and also fromn finding that the descendants of old friends who had passed away followed in the footsteps of their ancestors, and gave him their support. Ee had so often expressed his political views on that spot that it might perhaps bethought that he had now said enough, but he would not shrink frown declaring what had been his conduct with regard to a question which had for some time greatly occupied the mind of the public-he meant the China question. He was not about to apologize for his votes, be cause he believed that they had been in general accordance with the opinions of his constituents. (Rear.) With regard to the Chi question, it had been said that no constituency oughttopetheirconfi. dence in any one who had by his vote on that question been directly or indirectly the cause of the present sta.e of affairs, and that the vote was an attempt to displace the present Government. No*r, he could only say that when he gave his vote upon the motion, he did so with no desire to see Lord Pdlmerston removed from office. The term ,.infam ous coalition" had been applied to the nieeting in the same lobby of persons who did not usually act together. Now, he had most certainly joined in no coalition. The motion had been brought forward by Mr. Cobden, the nun of all others in the House of Conmmons he wlas the least
likely to follovr, and it was opposed by scarcely any menmber of eminence in the House, with the exception of those gentlemen comnected with the Government, and no less than 45 members who usuoally snpportedthe Government voted against them on that occasion. The decision was arrived at on the merits of the case solely, and, for his own part, he had voted as he had done because he was tisfied that Sir J. Bowring had gone beyond his instructions, pdndtdnanded a far greater reparation than was necessary under the circumstances of the case. Evea admitting that the Chinese had insulted the British flag-and no man would stand more upon the honour of the British flag than himself-the punishment had far exceeded the offence. The reprisals which were madeat first ought to have been quite suticient to satisfy the authorities abroad until they received instructii ns from home, and if they had waited for those instructions he did not believe that they would have found themselves called upon to batter down forts and bomnbard a uty in order to punish an offence of the nature of that wbich had been committ ed. The fact of the Government having since done that, which if they had done before the motion would have been -withdrawn, appeared to him t-
be a complete justification for every gentleman who had voted against hehm. The motion was a censure upon Sir J. Bowriag, and if the Government ehose to take a vote of censure upon one of their tsapZoys as a vote of censure ?pon themsyves, he was not responso}efor their doing so. Hlcould only add that he held still precisely the same opinionwvith regard to the conduct of Sir.J.'Bowig'which he held 'when he gave his vote. The couniti wvas now involved in whit might be, although he trns, t *ould not be, a long war, and which certainlyv 'woul Xn tpeusive war.

OFFIcrAL DRc.AR ATioN or T PoLL.
The Mayor (Mr. John Towvle) made the official announcement of the previous day's election yesterday morning, when the numbers were as follows:-
L3ngston .. .. . ... 1,667 Nleate ... . ... .. 1,067 Cardveli . .. 1,016 Gaselee . ... . . .. 25
After short speeches from the successful candidates, the Right Hon. EDAYnD CAaDWELL addressed the electors, and stated that,althoughhis name did not stand inits former pTaceinthatlist whichthe Mayorhadproclaimed, yethe was invited by the Mayor to address them on the occasion, and vith their permission he would express his feelings in a few brief words. He did not desire to disguise from them in the slightest degree the regret which ho sincerely felt at the announcement made by the Mayer. It was impossible for him to experience other than feelings of sincere regret at the personal connexion between them being about to undergo a temporary separation.- When he reflected upon the number and considered the character of those who had recorded their votes im his favour, when he remembered the perfect purity and iudependence with which those votes had been recorded, he coulidnot help feeling satisfied, and he thought it was particularly clear that he was not only justified in contesting the election, but that he should have deserted his post if be had taken any other course after the appeal made to him. He could truly say that the contest just terminated had in no degree diminished, on the contrary, it had strengthened and encouraged his feelings of attachment and respect for Oxford. To those who had given him their cordial and devoted support he eturned his wamet thanks; to those differing from him he acknowledged that, with rare exoeptions, they haLd differed from him with courtesy and good humour, and to the whole city of Ozferd he bee
then, to enter the respectful assurance of his cordka17hiz undiminished, and his undying attachment and regard. The right bon. gentleman retired amid great applase.
Mr. 8erjeant GAosEr, in a good-humourel speech, expressed the disappointment he had felt at the result of the Doll after the warm reception he had met with on the Saturday, and trusted that on some future occasion, if he was not wManted elsewhere, he would be returned as their representative. The learned Serjeant thought that Mr. Neate would make a Liberal and good member, whereas before they had only f. semi-Liberal in his place.

DUBLIN VNIrVERSITY.
The nomination of candidates for' the representation of "the Borough of the College of the Holy and lJndivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth" took place on Monday. The several oandidates and their friends were received with mingled demonstrations of favour and disapprobation on the pt of the general body of students outside the barrier.
Shortly after 10 o'dock the Very Rev. the Provost took his seat on the bench.
The law-agent, Mr. S. R. Nunn, having read the writ of election,
The Bev. Dr. LLoYD moved the nomination of Mr. George Alexader Hamilton.
Dr. GAYER, Q.C., seconded the nomination.
The Rev. Dr. WALM,, Vice-Provost, briefly proposed the Right Hon. Joseph Napier, LLD., Q.C., for re-election.
The Rev. H&RuLTox VERSOHOYLE seconded tbe nomination, but was scarcely able to proceed with his address, owin5g to the almost incessant uproar which was kept up, and the conftuion produced by the explosion of numerous well-directed products of the pyrotechnio art which were sent flying about the hall in all directions. The Provost Ithreatened to clear the hal but this produced but little effect, and it was not until the Rev. Mr. Hanuhton appealed to the students that Mr. Vexcchoyle was allowed to state in a few words the grounds upon which be asked their sufrages for Mr. Napier.
Tlhe Rev. S. HAUGITON proposed MIr. J. Wilson, M.A. The Rev. J. S. BLAcKWoOD seconded the nomination.
The Rev. Mr. JTLLTrT moved that Mr. J. A. Lawson, LLD., Q.C., be elected a member to represent the Ulnversity in Parliament.
The Rev. D. FOLEY seconded the nomination.
Mr. WErrLsin, MLP., then, for the purpose of havimg an opportrunity of addressing the electors proposed MIr. J. H. Otway, Qe.C
po other candidate having been proposed,
htr. G. A. H~trsON roes, and was, on the whole, well rece ved. After calling upon any elector of the city of Dublinwho waspresent, nd whomight uot yethave recorded his vote for Messrs. Grogan and Vance, he proceededto give an exposition of the principles which had gided his conduct in Parliament, and which he would continue to mantain whether they met with the approbation of the electors or not. Be referred at length to the details of the Chinese question, and contended that the vote which he had recordedon Mr. Cobden's motion was given from conscientious motives, was justified by the circumstauces of the case, and was in no way to be characterized as factious. (Cheers and groans.) For that vote he now stood at the bar of public opinion to be judged as the electors deemed best, and by their judgment would he abide. (Cheers.) He looked upon the Christianity of the constitution in all its elements, and upon the mainteDance of Protestantism as the basis of that constitution as essential to the prosperity and haopiness of the empire. He asked them to look to the appointments of Lord Derby, to the appointment of Dr. Singer to the see of Meatb, of Jewin to the archdeacory of mkly, and of Browne to the deanery of Emly (cheers), andao say were not those comparable with any which Lord Palmerston had rnade? As to the question regarding comietiive examinations, he could assure the electors that, both in his place in Parliament and as a member of LordfDerby'sAdminsstration,he had given it every eucouragement, and had been one o the first t endevour to bring it into operation. (Cheers.) In conclusion, he said that if the electors approved his past conduct, and the principles which he had said would gaide him in future, he would call upon them to elect him; otherwise they would voto for whatever other candidate they thought would most suit their views. (Cheers, and cries of " You are the man," accompanied also by some groans and hisses.)
The Right Hon. J. N,aPim then came forward, and was received with cheers, groans, and rounds of Kentish fire. He appealed to the electors whether he had violated his pledges, and in support of his appeal cited a letter from Mr. Foley in May, 1856, in which that gentleman spoke in most flattering terms of his (MIr. Napier's) services and character, and expressed his belief that he had not acted inconsistently with his promises. (Cheers.) As to the LAnd Bills, he said that, yielding to the opinions of those for whose judgment and wisdom he had the highest respect, he had abandoned those measures, believing them not likely to be productive of such beneficil results as he had himself anticipated from them. (Cheers and cries of "Oh !") He explained his conduct on the Maynooth and education questions, which he averred to eb that of a consdentious Protestant, anxious for the advancement of the best interests of that religion. Be thought that if they were to change their representatives they must change their opinions, for the addresses of the other candidates did not reflect the sentimentb which actuated the electors in sending himself and MEr. Hamilton into Parliament. "Hear, hear," and cheers.) If it were true that the downfal of the Irish church establishment would follow the diaendowment of MAynooth, he would advise them to put their hoss in order ; for he could tel them that the grant to the latter was not worth three years' purchase. Hear, be-ar.) He could say that the result of the carrying out of the expressed intention of the Government in respece
to MIinistesMoney would be the stripping of may ofithe clerg of the established church of the larger portion of thEeir income, and that the M* initei who woquld do tbfis for the sake of catching a few votes would sacrifice the Church the moment it suited his purpose to do so. (Ceers. So far as the naxtional system of education ws concerned, he held at the money granted by the State had beenL devoted to obstruct rather than promote the objects for which it had been voted. (Cheers.) He referred to his services in Parliament, where, hesid, his conduct hadbeenapprovedby Iord Drby; who had never askedhim to vote ay way that was not in accordance with his conscientious convictions, even when they clashed with the convictions of the heads of the Conservative party.
At the termination of Mr. Napier's speech the further proceedings of the nomination were adjourned to xext morning at 10 o'clocl;.

-Ir. rI.aGHXTEY next addesed the lectors. He siaid
differed from Wis colleagne in A4, that he should addrex himuelf to all present, non-etltois as well as electors. (Cheers.) He agreed with thowe who eulogized lord -aA-. merston as the pilot who weathered the storm, but he must remind themthiatLordrPltnerston was oneof LordAberdeen's Governmient, which ws in power when the storm began, and thathe -was asmuch responsible as any one for all that had occurred abt that fme. Still, as a fajrandimpartial man, he was. bliged to allow that Lord Palmerston'e conduct when he took offioe- was deserving of the highest credit (loud cheers), and that he came out in bright contrast to those -who, like Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Sidney Herbert, showed a craven heart when the vessel of the StateE eemed to be driving on a lee-shore, and who not only deserted the ship, but did everythingin heirpower to embarrs the pilot. (Eear,) But the Conservatives, on the other hand, might claimreditfor the generous and disinterested support which they had given to Lord Palmerston's Government under these cireumstances-eonduct which contrasted most forcdbly vith the policy pursued by the Whigs in the last French war. He had no wish to say anytbingdiarespectfal of his noble opponent, for he had the highest personal respectfo- him, and he hoped that their friendly relations would continue as warm as everwhen this contest was over; but, spealdng of him as a public man, he was bound to ay that le had never in all his Psaiamentary experien e kno0n an instance of a candidate presenting himself before a constituency on such flimsy pretences. (Groans.) Had the noble lord given them any clear and defined notion of his Parliamentary opinions s Not a bit of it. He did not profess any political opinions at all in his address, but he told the electors to take dovwn ertain old dusty volumes of "Annual Registers" and Parliamentary debates to find out there what his unde'p opinions wvere, and that then they would know by that roundabout procese what his dpinions were. lt was some 25 years sinie the late Lord Spencer had represented South NTorthamptonshire -before the noble lord was born or even thought of ; amsA he had a shrewd suspicion that at the time when he penxw-
his archeological address the noble lord had not read all -
uncle's speeches, nor had he any distinct idea as to what; -vere the principles to which he was rashly committig himself (Cheers and groans.) Was the noble lord infavour of the ballot or of triennial Parliaments, as Lord Althorpwas 7 Was he prepared to apply the revenues of the church to secular purposes, and was he prepared to deprive the tenant.fasrmer and oc_upier of the soil of the exercise of that franchise which he was willing to concede to the olf. householder in boroughsg? In conclusion he thanked them for the attention with vwich they had heard imu, and he hoped the result of the election would be to place himsdfl and his colleague at the head of the polL
Lord ALToHRP then presented himself, and was reeived 'with loud cheers, which lasted several minutes When silence was restored the noble lord proceeded to say that, although he had never before been present at a nomination, he had read and head enough of such proceedings to kDow that some things had been said that day which it was not usual to say on such ocasions. The hon. gentlemen opposed to him had spoken in a spirit worthy of themselves, but their supporters had not been so guarded, and, withoutwish. ing to say anything irritating to the feeings of any one, -for itwashis desire to conciliate, not to irrtate-he could not, with a due regard to his own honour, allow what had been said by them derogatory to him, to the electors and, to their independenoe, to pass without remark. (Cheers.) He was ca!led a "sprig of the aristocracy in answer to that he could only say that he hoped he should turn out to be a good "sprig" (cheers), and that the "sprig " woull grow up into a goodlytree, and would bearfrait accordingly. (Loud cheers.) The hon. baronet who proposed Colonel Vyse expressed a hope that money would not carry the election, and he cordially agreed with the hon. baronet in that hope. He was sure, in fact, that the electors would not allow money to carry the election. He came forward as an independent man, relying oa his principles and not on money. He was not to be brought in entirely by riches
that would not go down in South Northamptonshire. (Cheers.) The hon. baronet insinuated that if he got in it would be by bribery, bat the days of bribery were gone by, and hefelt confident thatif there was any bribery at all-and he trusted there would be none-it would not be on hisside. (Cheers) It had been said that if he wee elected the county would be henceforward saddled with the Spencer family, but he did not rest himself at all on hisemnilyinfluence. He case the handle to his name to the winds, and came before them relying for his election solely on his Liberal principles. (" You're the man-Althorp for ever.") He could not help remarking on the singularly improper manner in which one gentleman had dragged in the namne of a noble lady, and he thought they would all agree with him that Me mention of her name was entirely uncalled for. (Cheers.) As to undue influence, he entirely repudiated the charge that any such influence had been used by his party. He knew of none on his own side, but he did know several cases on the other side. He was quite certain that his father, who had taken no part in this election, would not do a single thing to coerce any tenant to vote for htim who did not wish it. Hon. gentlemen who found fault withhis address did not seem to understand the simple word "Libera," but for their satisfaction he would state to them more at length what he meant by that word, and what his prindples were. Great exceptions were taken to his declaration that his pr.iciples were the same as his unle's, and it ws said that he was too young to know anything about his unlde's rin. ciples. Although there might be a difference in the quesbions which agitated the public mind, general principles enained the same, and surely he had sara andeyes by which he could hear and read what his uncle's principles were. (Loud cheers.) He had tberefore a perfect right to sas that he agreed generally with his ucle sprincipes, although the questions upon which they came into action miht be differmt, The only argument which had been used by n
of his opponents against his return was that Colonel Vyse ought not to be turned out. ("Why not ?") Colonelyse was brought in at a time when a mnan waa wanted to oppose free trade, but what reasoa was that for keeping him new that free trade had long been the law of the land? (Cheers.) How many well-tried membershadbeen sent back to private life at this very election. Therewasno great question now beforethe constituencies * the only point was,whether Lord Palmerston or Lord Derby were to govern the country. ("Psimerston forever I") TPhe ri ht hon. gentleman the leader of the Opposition said that ord Palmerston had nothing to go to the country upon but his name, but surely it was something to havea name on which to go tothe coun'try. (Hear, hear.) The other side had no such name. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston's career was well known, and it fully entitled him to t'e support of his countrymen. When the war began he was not at the head of affairs, hut no sooner WAS he made Prime Minister than a change for the better instantly began to take place in our our army in the Crimea, and it was speedily placed in such a stateas enabled us to beat the Pussiansand obtain an honourable peace. Lord Palmerston's policy was called " turbulent and aggressive" buttheassertion was entirely destitute of proof. Thewar with Persia hadbeenconcluded,thehostilities with China 'would very soon be at an end. and England would then be at peace with all the world. He was not one of those who wished to see this country at war, no matter with whom, in order to k-eep up the price of wheat above 35s. He had met vith some farmers durimg his canvass who professed that they hLed war because then they gotgood prices, hut he himself did not like war. Lord Palmerston did not like war, but it was impossible to maintain peace without going to war sometimes. It was by war that peace was maintaiued. What would those who now clamoured againsA the hostilities in China do if they were placed in power ? Would they apologize to Yeh and rebuild all the fortifications which had been knocked down 9 Would they have disavowed our oflicials out there ? Not a bit of it, for they knew as well as Lord Palmerston that by sneh a course they would destroy aU vigour of action amnwg cur officials, and that none of them would dare to take a single step if be had the fear of being thrown over before his eyes. Coming next to questions of domestic policy, and first of all to the Maynooth grant, his opiiion was that that grant ought to be maintained. He had found in the course of his canvass &thatmanypersonsdid not seem to be aware that this was apuermanent grant, and not renewed every year, and this, ighi5 opinion, made agreat difference. (Cheers.) As amatter of policy, it would be the wvorst" thing in the world to withdrarw the grant, for insurection and tumult woul follow, and the Protestant church would no longer be able to make that way in Ireland which he believed she was now making. It was his fim belief as a stanch Pro. testantthat it would be unjustand unwise to break the compact entered into by Sir Robert PeeL As to the question of church-rates, he could not deny that it was very hard that Dissentern should be called upon to pay for the maintennce of a church from which they differed. Very few o4urch of England men, he thought, would object to an alteration in this respect. He was not for the total abolition of church-rates; he wished to see the righ±r of the church maintained, but he did not think that -
alteration in the present arrangement would be a spoliat..., of the church. lie was in favour of an extension of tE;
sufrge, but not a blind extension. The sudl-age ought to
be possessed by every man who deserved it, sud there were many such who did not now possess it, but whatever exten. sion there was ought to be conducted with grea caution. It was said that he came forward with no fixed Tinoples
tall, and that he sirmply asked to be sent to Pa-iament in order to be able to mature his principles, but that he denied altogether. He had considered all the great public questions carefully and to the best of bis abilty, and if wey returned him he hoped that they would be sati-fled with his course ef action. In conclusion, he hoped that they would come early to the poll on Friday, and he felt sure that before the middle of the day his victory would be secure. (Loud cheers.)
The Rev. MI. IcanyxD asked the noble lord how he should vote in regard to the proposal for preventing the desecration of the Sabbath?
Lord ALTRORP said, he should vote against the opening of the Crystal Palace on Sundays, becauseit wonld be msert ing the thin end of the wedge for opening other plaoes, suech as theatres.
The Rev. Mfr. IafcFErD--Wil1 you vote for the extinction of the income-tax in 1860 ?
Lord ALTrORP.-Most certainly I wil. In answer to an elector,
3Ir. MIauTLEY said he had intentionally absented himself from the diviAion on the China question.
In answer to a question from an elector,
Colonel IryS said that if he were returned be s hould attend in the House as often as possible. He hadbee
onliged to absent himself on 7arious occasions in the last session from peculiar private business. He was not in faveur of the abolition of promotion by purchase, for he bdli4e the practicaleffect ofit was, as a generalrule, lo gsiepo mothon bymnerit. , - -
A show of hands was then taken. lFor CoIoaiiV's there appeared about 50, for Mr. Kmghtleynotmiaiy-more, but for Lord Althorp some thousands, at least
The Riso SssRn?P declared the election to have falen or, Imrd Althorp and .lr. Knightley.
A poll was demanded on behalf of Colonel Vyse, which
zing to celebrate the fall of Sebastopol, which had been announced by it, and it afterwards turned out that the an. 2souncenientwas incorrect. If persons were desirous of get. ting rid of the income-tax they must not cry out for too much war. (Hear, hear.) It was true that what had been called the "war ninepence" had been taken off by the Government, but he questioned if that would have been done but for the strong feeling exhibited throughout the country, and the preservation of peace would afford the bet, if not the only, prospect of the removal of the whole of the tax in 18t0. With regard to church-rates, he could only say that he could see no objection to an alteration in the present mode of levying them if an efficient substitute
could be provided for the maintenance of the fabric of the I church ; but that was the great difficulty, and if none could be found he would oppose any measure for the abolition of church rates. On the question of the education of the people, he could only say that, anxious as he was to see overy ran procure for bis children such an education as would tend to their advantage, he could not vote for any system of education of which the reading and teaching of the Scriptures did not fornm the basis. As regarded the Maynooth grant, he was prepared to vote for its repeal, as he had always done. It had been said that all Reformers were improvers. Now, that was a strong assertion (a laugh) and without declaring himself to be a Reformer-although he denied that he had never voted for measures of reformhe was qjuite prepared to consider on its owII merits any question of reform which might be brought forward; and if it met with his approval he would give it his support, and he did not believe that Lord Palmerston would bring in any measure of reform likely to be injurious to the interests of the State. With regard to supporting Lord Palmerston, he could only say that he had never been a party man. He had given to every Government a fair, a liberal, and an in. dependent Sapport, if in his opinion the measures introduced by them would tend to tho public good, and be should continue to do so if again returned to Parliamen,t. A right hon. friend of his bad, on one occasion, stated that a member representing a constituency should be a man whose name and character would reflect credit upon those whom he repreFented, and that he should be a man whom they could entirely trust. Now, he would accept that definition, and he would ask the electors of Berkshire, did his name and character reflect credit upon them 9 (Cries of " Yes,") Could they trust him ? ("iAnywhere.") They had trusted him for 32 years, and he did not think that'he had done anything to shake their confidence. ('? Hear, hear," and a Voice "What about Locke Kings motion ?") He had voted against that measure because he agreed with what had been said to him by his hon. friend, Mr. Walter, that it was a tinkering -way of dealing with a great subject. It had been his intention to retire at the close of the session, but its conclusion had been so abrupt that he had felt it to be his duty to listen to the solicitations which bad been addressed to him by many of his old friends, and again to offer his services to the constituency of Berkshire. (The hon. gentleman concluded by thanking the electors for the patient bearing whlich they bad accorded to him, and sat down amid loud cheers.)
Mr. VAIsTTrAnRT said, that he could not boast as long a connexion with the elcotors as Mr. Palmer, but he had on a previous occasion solicited their suffrages at the request of a large body of the middle classes whose battle he had come forward to fight at great inconvenience to himself. ie now thought that he might base his claim to their anpport on the ground that he had never, eitherin or out of Parlament, betrayed the interests which had been confided to hin. It had been said that he had been absent from his place in Parliament during the whole of the short session wbich had recently been terminated by a dissolution. The reason that he had been absent was that he had been summoned to Italy on account of the illness of a relation, but before leaving England, rot knowing that the Government would take off the war ninepence, and thinking that the subject would soon be brought before the House, he had paired with a strenuous supporter of the Government for a month. He had never professed himself a Liberal, because, in point of fact, he believed that 'hose who caUed themselves Liberals were generally the most iUiberal. (Hear, hear.) That had been shown at the passing of the Reform Bill, for if the proposal of the Liberals had been agreed to one class of the community would have been entirely deprived of the franchise. As regarded the question of the reform of the electoral franchise, since the time he had had a seat no measure had been brought forward in a form likely to pass through the House of Commnons. Mr. Locke King's motion threw the whole of the representation of the countrv upon one class, (" No, no 1" and "Elear, bear !") Now, in his opinion taxation and representation should go together, and without saying ahsolutely that every one who was taxed should be represented,
et, when a tax foil particularly upon one class, it might
possible to proceed upon the principle of conferring representation upoii that class. On the question of educatioznal reform he had voted for continuing the existing system, for he was opposed to any system of education which omitted the element of religious teaching; indeed, he did not think it possible entirely to separate religious teaching from secular istruction. lie hadneveropposed anymeasureof law reform, nor, indeed, had Ihe ever been averse to any real, sound, practical reform; but change and reform were not always synonymous. (Hear.) The ticket-of-leave system, for instance, had been brought forward as a great reform, but the result had proved that it could not be carried out, and it had become necessary to revert to the former system. He was opposed to the Maynooth grant; and he should always advocate the observance of the Sunday as it existed at present, because he believed that in this country a happy medium was preserved between the views of those who held extreme opinions on the one side,- and the continental system on the other. With regard to the question of county finance, he thought that the ratepayers should have some share in the management of the finances of the county, but the Bill which had been brought in upon the subject had been so defective in its machinery that he Pad not been able to give it his support. He could not vote for the Bill for the abolition of church-rates, because he believed that such a measure would spread confusion instead of creating peace throughout the country. There was, however, one question upon which he differed from his hon. friend (Mr. Palmer), and that was the China question. Had he been in England when Mr. Cobden's motion was brought forward he would have voted in support of tIne Government, because he believed that the affair of the Arrow was only the crowning insult of a long series, and he thought that that bsing the case Lord Palmerston was quite justified in determining at all risks to maintain the acts of the British officials in China, and also on the principle that when officers were sent abroad and placed in positions of great difficulty it was the duty of the Government to support them. He had already stated that he would support Lord Palmerston if he should introduce good measures, but if he introduced rash ones he sbould as certainly oppose him. He bad never, and he trusted he never should, offer a factious opposition to any Government, and he felt snore inclined to support the Government of Lord Palmerston than he should feel to support a Government composed of elements so discordant 'with each other as the Conservative party and Mr. Gladstone and bis friends (bear, hear); and he believed that such was the opinion of the majority of the electors of the county. (Hear, hear.) With regard to local affairs he had laboured assiduiously in behalf of the constituency, and upon one ocoasion hce bad procured an alteration in a nieasure which apperred likely to clash with their interests. Upon these grounds he trusted that he should be favoured with a renewal of their confidence, end, if he should bo so, the electors rnight depend upcon his doing his utmost to continue to deserve it.
Mr. BoUVERIE next addressed the electors. He said, that he had not the advantage of previous connexion with the county, but had come forward, not at his own instance, but at the requisition of a large meeting of freeholders held at Newbury, who thought that it was not desirable that the three members for the county should always vote the same way. Mr. V'ansittart had stated that upon the Chiua question he did not agree with Mr. Palmnor, but he had voted on the same side. (' No, no!" and " Yes, yes!"') He was aware that he had not been present in person, but, although he regretted the cause of the absence of the hon. gentlemen, still he did iiot think that a iiiember of Parliament ought to make arrangements for voting against the Minister for a mionth without knowing what measures were brought forward. A good deal had been said about churchrates. Now, he was prepared to abolish themn and resort to the voluntary system at once. As regarded education, he could only say that religious teaching should form part of all education ; but wvhen people were willing to help themselves, whether Dissenters or members of the Church, he thought it advisable that they should receive assistance from the Government. With regard to the question of reform, he would employ the language of one more eloquent than himself, and be could not imagine language better calculated to state his views. Lord Palmerston. in his speech at Tiverton, said,-
"Any Government worthy of the position must feel that no nation can stand still; that England is not China; that the people of England are not to continue to be precisely in the same situation with respect to their institutions from year to year and from century to century. We are a progressive people, and therefore progressive improvements in all our institutions must be adopted, and must be the guiding principle of every Government that wishes to miaintain itself in the confidence and affections of the people. I be. lieve our institutions to be in the main better than those of any other country on the face of the globe, without a single exception. I do not say on that account that they cannot be improved. Al human institutions must necessanily he imperfect. Ours in all their branches are, no doubt, susceptible of amelioration; and the Government that shut its eyes to facts and circumstances, and
wished to maintain things in all respects as they are, simply because they are, would be a Government upon which the lessons of experience and the reasonings of men would be utterly thrown away. But I am sure you would feel that it would be unbecoming in me to enter into detailed pledges, or hold out distinct promises upon any of those points in which many of you must take an interest. It would not be my duty to do so, however I may disappoint the expectations of some wHom I am now addressing; and the duty of silence, like other duties, I shall feel it imperatively necessary to
perform. Now, gentlemen, economy, no doubt, is a matter deeply interesting to the people of this country. The Government that launched into lavish expenditure without adequate necessity would not be deserving of the confi. dence .nd would not receive thesupporteitherof Parliament or of ths people."
Now, those principles he entirely endorsed and, if elected, he would always act upon them. If he had been in the House he would have voted for Mr. Locke King's motion
against the Government, because he thought that the objections to the measure were only founded upon matters of detail and not on principle. He begged to remind the electors that he had been a IReformer even before the passing of
the Roform Bill, and he had seen no reason since for alter. ing the opinions which he then held. He was aware that he did not hold any property in the county, but he was connected with it through h family, and he could assure the electors that if they -did him th honour of returning him their interests would be as dear to him as they would be if he were one of the large landed proprietors of Berkshire. (Hear, hear.)
Captain VEItNox, who was received with loud cheers, then came forward and said,-I think, gentlemen, that you bave already had enough of hustings' oratory, and, after the Specimens which have been placed before you, I feel myself isa the category of those who appear after some graeftl
aWas flxad for Friday, and tbo proceedings then terminated with a vote of thanks to the sheriff.
SUSSEX (WEST).
Yesterday the n,omination of two knights of the shire to scrve in Psrliament for the western division of the county
Sussex took place at the Guildhall, Chichester. 3r. l. C. Pomphret, High Sheriff, presided.
After the customuary preliminaries,
Mr. W. T. MILFORD proposed the Earl of March, who 2:d represented the division for 16 years.
Colonel C. LLovD seconded the nomination.
Mr. G. BARTEL.LOT nominated, and Major SANDIA4M m conded Captsin H. WVyodham.
'lhere being no other neminations, the Earl of Maroh and C'aptsin Wyndiham were declared duly elected, and were girt with swords.
Th'ee Earl of MARCH then addressed the electors, expressing bis thanks for the bonour done him. Referring to the
rircumstances which had led to his present appearance befoi0o the constituency his Lordship said,-.-Beleiving that the reasons adduced by Lord Derbvin the House of Lords and by A r. Cobden in the Htouse of Commons on the China question avtre unanswerable, he had heartily and cheerfully given his support to the motion brought forward by Mr. Cobden. A s a matter of national policy the coursepursued was wrong. Au endeavour should have been made to conciliata the Em.
eror of China, as we had conciliated other P'owers, as a arrier against the aggressive policy of Russia. (Cheers.) Hce could not support Sir J. Pakington's Educational Bill, because it did not sufficiently recognize the necessity of religion. it wss indispensable that any scheime of national education should be founded on the Bible. (Cheers.) Refesrinig to the income-tax, his lordship said tbe country was not indebted to Lord I'almerston for the removal of the war 9d. that formed no part of the estimates ; but the result was brought about by the speeches of Mr. Gladstone and Mfr. Disraeli on the first night of the session. There was a cant cry that Lord Pahnerston is the only ..5an for the country, but he could not find any one ques-
-ion of public importance with which the name of Palmer-Fton was identified, and he therefore altogether differed
fromi that view. Lord Palmerston was a Minister without a policy, and his Government a Government without principles. (-' Hear," and " No!") HisLordship proceeded to allude to Mr. Locke King's motion, and called upon the agriculturists to beware of a man who would support an extension of the 10. franchise to 101. householders.
Captain WYNDAiAM next addressed the electors. He was still prepared to act on Tory principles, but was not opposed to Lecessary reforms. Alludingto education, Captain Wyndham said, he should be ready to support a measure which, vhile founded on a religious basis, should have a due regard to the opinions of the various denominations. (Cheers.) He concluded by pointing out to the Conservative party the necessity of union, rendered more than ever imperative at tbis juncture. (Applause.)
A vote of than-as to the High Sheriff, proposed by Lord MARtC}, andseconded by Captain WYNDHAM, concluded the proceedings.
NORTH HANTS.
The nomination for this division took place yesterday at the Grand Jury Cbamber, Winchester. The two late members, the Right Hon. the Speaker and Mr. M. Portal, having retired, the candidates were all new men.
Mr. Csw11X, of the Vine, proposed, and Mr. R. PYLE:, tenant-farmer, of Tufton, seconded, Mr. W. W. B. Beach, of Oakley-hall.
Mr. F. J. E. JERVOrSX proposed, and Sir J. POLLENS seconded, Mr. G. Sclater, of Hoddington-house.
M[r. J. W. SCOTT, of Rotherfield, proposed, and Mr. T. G. BARING seconded, Colonel D. W. Carleton, of the Coldstream Guards.
Mr. Beach being absent in America, his friend Mr. Benson appeared for bin, and made some jocular remarks on the appearance of Colonel Carleton in the field, after they bad thought that they should have a walk over the course. Colonel Carleton came before them as a supporter of Lord l'almerston, but he must say that he was stepping into the shoes of the two other candidates, from whose success Lord Palmerston had nothing to fear. Mr. Beach, through his friends, stated distinctly that he would have been no party to any coalition, whether brought about by Mr. Cobden, Lord John Russell, or any one else.
Mr. SCLATEIt did not think the electors would choose as their reprebentative a regimental officer who came amongst them at the eleventh hour. He could not help thinking that that it would have been better if Colonel Carleton had been ordered off to rough work in China rather than have come to contest that election. If he were elected he should go to Parliament as an independent supporter of Lord l!erby, hut always to act honestly, and not to intrigae for power, and he felt that if Lord Plalmerston did not obtain the support of the Conservative party it would be his own fault.

Colonel CARLETON came forward that the electors might have an opportunity of being represented by a man of the same political principles as the late Speaker of the House of Comulions, who bad represented them for the last 27 years, not as the nominee of my Lord this, or Sir that; but as the exponent of defined principles. He should be the unpledged supporter of Lord 1alnierston, whom he looked upon as a man of energy, who had carried the country through the late contest with a true spirit of British honour and of devotion to that flag wh ich he hoped would never be struck. He was for a constant and safe improvement in our institutions, without giving a sudden shock to tham, and he should advocate every necessary retrenchment consistent with the requirements of the public service. He was for a le extensi,n of the suffrage, and should vote for Locke ing's motinii, but not for the ballot at present.
A show of hands was taken, and declared to be in favour of Beach and Sclater, and a poll was demanded for Colonel Carleton. The polling wil take place on Friday.
ISLE OF WIGHT.
The nomination of candidates to represent this county took place at Newport yesterday. Mr. C. W. ESTcouRT, the Under-Sheriff, presided.
Sir JOuN SlimEN nominated, and Mr. BOxnAU-CARTER seconded, Mr. Charles Cavendish Clifford as a fit and Proper per.on to be a knight of the shire for the Isle of Wight.
Sir HiNn;V Go(,'on nominated Mr. Thomas Wills Fleming, who was seconded by Captain AnDR1-w SNAP3 HANIOND, R.N.
bMr. CLuIFORD was the first to address the eleotors. He said } e was favourable to the extension of the franohise; he was not one who believed that any mischief would arise from political Power being confided to the people; although a supporter of Lord Palmerston's Govermnent he should have voted for Locke King's motion; he was decidedly in favour of the baUot and progrssive reform- an advocate of religious liberty, and, if elected, would vote for tho abolition of that last shred of intolerance, the exclusion of Jcws from Parliament; he should vote for the abolition of church-rates, as he believed they were most adverse to the true interests of the church. These sentiments were repeatedly cheered.
Mr. FLENING said he based his pretensions to the support of the electors on the fact that they were moro familiar with his face than that of Mr. Clifford, and from his being better acquainted with their local interests ; he had metthem most liberally in his address; he belonged to no political party nor to any political club - he was not a Radical-Liberal nor a Tory-Conservative, but a Liberal-Conservative; he would offer no opposition to the ballot, bat be would not pledge himself to support it or oppose it, as he considered this an unfavourable timne for doing so; he was favourable to an extension ci the franchise, but with reference to counties he did not think it expedient to descend lower than a 25t. rental, as he consid-red a county constituency ought to be composed of the agricultural portion of the community ; he was in favour of an equitable adjustment of church-rates, and of gradual social and political progress.
On a show of hands being taken, there was a large majority in favour of hMr. Clifford, and a poll was demanded for MIr Flemuing, which was fixed for Friday next.
SUFFOLK (WEST)
The election of two knights of the shire to represent the western division of the county of Suffolk took place on the Angel-hill, Bury St. Edmund's, yesterday.
As was anticipated, there was no opposition to the old members, Yr. H. S. Waddington and Mr. P. Bennet, and but little interest was taken in the proceedings, not more than 100 persons being present.
Major P.%RKER proposed Mr. Henry Spencer Waddington as a fit and proper person to represent this division of the county in Parliament. (Cheers.)
Captain BENCE seconded the nomination. (Cheers.)
Sir Rt. BlxTroN nominated Mr. P. Bennet, of Rougham. Mr. ORD seconded the inomination. (Cheers.)
The Hisose SIIERIsFF then said, as there was no other gentleman to be put in nomination he should declare that Messrs. Waddington and Bennet were duly elected. (Cheers.) Mr. WADDINGTON, in thanking the electors, remarked, tbat lie should again support those Conservative principles which he had first enunciated, and which he thought would he for the benefit of the county. (Mluch applause.)
Mr. P. Bs_NirT, in returning thanks, said, he would endeavour to support " improvement and not destruction." (Applaise.) He sbould abide by the constitution as it now e Isted, and went on to condemn tho cry put forth by Lord `%almerston about the flag of England.
A vote of thanks was accorded to the High Sheriff, after which the proceedings torminatedL

Iarker's-piece, at Cambridge, Yesterday. The show of hands was in favour first of M r. Ball, and secondly of Mr. Adeane, and the numbers appeared to be on the first show so ev.nly balanced between the Hon. Eliot Yorke and Lord
George Mlanners that a second show had to be taken as betweeua those two gentlemen, after which the IHigh Sheriff declared Mr. Yorke to have the majority. The Sheriff declared the election to have fallen, so far as the show was concerned, u_on Messrs. Yorke, Ball, and Adeane.
The Hon. M. T. YOBRJE was the first of the candidates to address the electors. The hon. gentleman said that he had
never given a vote with more careful cousideration than the one he had recorded against the late Government on
the Chinese question, and he believed that if the question were to be tried in any court in England that the verdict would be in favour of the Chinese. lie was a party man in every sense, and he believed that those who said the
were not so were utterly powerless for both good and evil Lord Palmerston had during his political career seen 13 Adnainistrations, and had been a member of 10, beginning with Mr. Perceval's, a High Tory one, on the one hand, and ending with Lord Grey's, the greatest Reformer of the age, in the opposite extreme; and therefore was not the man
to whorn anything like the adulation now bestowed upon him was due. Mr. Yorke expressed himself in favour of the collection of a religious rate to the same amount as church-
rates at present, but said he would have it applied without preference to the maintenance of every Protestant religious edifice in the coantry.
Lord GEoRoE MIANymcs thought the vtote on the Chinese matter an exceedingly proper one, and though he had high
zeapept for the talent of Lord Palmerston, and his conduct
of the Rim ain war, was not prepared to a sa that he w as the only man who could administer with su)ce the affairs of this country. Re (Lord G. UManers) was In
fa vour of te settlemnent of th church-rate quetin by edmeton, s,nmn his pnion, bee>tanaw0o erna the purpoe
a nd demuands of the c ountry. With rear t inne finept
was for a x tianctot tho systeof ot5 lBan d lits exp
ward in the place of Mr. James Heywood, who did not offer himnself for re-election.
Mr. R. TOWNLEY PARKER, late M.P. for Preston, proposed, and Mr. JosEPH FRuLDEN, of Witton-house, near Blackburn, seconded Mr. J. W. Patten, of Bank-hall, in the southern division of the county.
Mr. J. PILKINGTON, M.P. for Blackburn, in the absence of Mr. E. G. Hornby. of Hornby Castle, near Lancaster,
rosed Lord Cavendish; and the nomination was seconded Cyr. S. E. BoLDrN, of Springfield-hall.
Mr. W. A. F. SAUNDRS, of Wennington-hall, then addressed the eleotors, rather, he said, than allow the election to go off without a word being said upon the atrocities which had lately taken place at Canton, and which he grieved to find that so many of his feliow-oountrymen had endorsed.
Mr. PATTEN then spoke, stating that he stood before thein for the eighth time under similar circumstances. Upon constitutional questions he entertained the same opimons as ho did when first elected. He was not in favour of the ballot nor of electonal districts. Sabbath legislation ought to be left entirely to the publio at large to work it out before it came into Parliament; of this proposition the fate of his own Sunday Beer Bill was a good illustration. EUrless preceded by demonstrations on the part of the public, legislation upon social matters and the internal improvement of the country went for nothing. It seemed almost impossible to sketch out a plan of education which would meet the con'dicting views of the publc. The voluntary system did not reach places where it was most wanted; the same might be said of the present system in a less degree *and relhgions instruction ought to form part of any scheme. He approved the plan recently proposed so far as it avoided centralization and left the power in the hands of the eople* baut he would not pledge himself to support it until he saw whether it could he hrought out practically. Upon the China question his feelings were not in accordance with what appeared to be those ofat e country. He did not think Sir John Boqring was justified by the papers laid before the House. He gave the Government the greatest credit for the course they had taken in sendinlg out Lord Elgin.
Lord CAveNDISHr said, that he went to Pariament almost unpledged. He agreed With Mr. Batten, and did not vish to see introduced into a Reform Bill any scheme for the theoretical perfection of the House of Commons, because the present constitution secured the represertation of ell classes. This was a suitable time for introducing a measure of reform. The reasona that there was no excitement upon the duestion was that people expected the subject to be constdered next Parliament. He was glad to ace that the champion of Reform (Lord J. Russell) had been re-elected. (Applause.) He (Lord Cavendish) would support every practicable economy consistent with the preservation of our honour, and the securty of our interests. l e admiredLord Palmerston, and thoughtthhat his opponents had done much to raise him to the pinnacle upon which he I nowv stood; and at the same time he was not in any nay
pledged tEIon Wuppr Mm.

LINfCOLNTSHIRE (X~OBTH).
The nomination for the northern division of the county of Lincoln was held in the Castle-yard yesterd.
Major G. T. W. STANEsaiP, hP., proposed as a candidate Mr. James Bancs Stanhopet of Reveaby-abbey. Mr. G. S. Lmaista seconded the nominration.
The Hon. WaTedan MONSOh d proposed Sir Montagu John Cholmeley, of Plorton-place. The Right Hon. Cv HSich TisconscN D'EYicOtarei seconded the nomino-
No other candidate being proposed,
The Mr. FF declared ri ames o ar. Stanhope and Sir Montagu John Oarolmene c duly elected.
a r. J. B. Sman,fomE said, the princpies he advocated when he came before them as a eandidate in 1852 he still maintained. He advocated then protection to agriculture, and he ha' acted and should act up to his profession. The vote against Lord Palmerston on the China question was a votewhich his concience dictated him to give, and he did not regretshaving'dne so; but to sy that because hevoted with er. Cobden he was a friend of Mr. Cobden's was au absurdity. ee did not know him personally, and he was glad he was not in Parliament. Ee considered Mr. Cobden a dangerous man, from the principles which he professed
and he felt sure that, of 31 divisions in the House of Commons, in 30 cases he would not be found wsith him. He did not know sr. Cobden privately and politieally they were nearly al ays in opposition. He deprecated th cry of "LTord Palmerston for ever P' " Palmerston for Minister !" He thought they should go for measures in preference to men. Lord Palmerston was a very able man, and the way in which he, as leader of the Ho&se of Com;mons, was found at his pest day after day and niSht after night was surprising. Lord balmerston durinEG his da had seen 15
Governments, and had sat in 10 of them; they had been in | existence o3 years, 40 of w hich years he was in the G-overnment.
Sir L. CEoL.COLEY said, he supported in general Lnrd Palnerston's views, but he should have voted against him on the qcestion raised with regard to Sir John h'Neill and Colonel Tulloch. He was a sincere Protestant, and he shonld ever endeavour to uphold all the Protestant institutions of the country. He believed that Lord Palmerston was the best Minister at the prenset time, and that he was a sincere reformer, and, aslthouh he miht have commenced ! his political careernas a Tory, he had, like others altered his
opinions, he thankedjther cordiall for the honour they had donelhim, for it had fulfilled a prophecy whioh he made at the last election, that he should be afain s etfrnaed as their representative. (Cheers.)
A vote of thanks was accorded by acclamation to the High Sheriff.

Mo. BeaUMONT expressed a geneial adhesion to the views and policy of Lord Palmerston's Government. He was prepared to vote for an extension of the franchise, and for an increase in the number of Parliamentary representatives to large tolns.
The Hon. Mr. LIDDELL critiCsed the policy of the Government in reference to the Chinese and Persian were, expressed himself in favour or the admission of Jewrs into Parliament, and opposed to the diSendowRent of Maynooth College. Ho referred to some other questions of domestic policy, and hoped to see the istroduction of some well digested scheme of emigration, which would furnish an out let for the ever-growing polulation of the county.
The proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the High S eriff.
DIJREAM (SOUTH).
The nomination for the southern division of this county took place at Darlington yesterday in front of the Town-
Lord Earry Vane was proposed by Mr. W. Hpwer, t .p for Gateshead, and seconded by Mr. R>. H. and, Of Blackwell.
Mr. Farrer was proposed bv Mr. M. FOwVLBR, of Preston. hall, and seconded by Colonel SrOBnB.ur
Mr. Pease was proposed by Mr. G. J. ScvsFrnnL, of Haworth, and seconded by his brother, Mr. Jos
Lord HACbdsy VAroE, in addressing the assemblage, based his elaims to their support not onlyon his pest conduct with reference to the local interests of the county, hut also on his political eonduct during the time he had represented that important division in Pariment He had ever cao prate with the g,reat Liberal party. he, however, thought it his duty on the Chdinese question to oppose Lord Palmerston's Government. Recent intelligence which had leen received afforded the hoDe that this dispute would be speedily settled; and he would do all in his powver to support the Government to bring it to an honourable and satisfactory termina&tion. (Applause.) With reg^ard to education, he expressed himself in favour of the present system, which he thought best calculated to promote the intelligence asd happiness of the people.
Mr. mattErR was received with loud applause. He stood before them as an independent man, and was not the nominee of any man or of any party. He could not honestly support Mr. Cobden's motion because he believed the interests
of segland were imperilled by it, and he could not give al I vote contrary to the dictates of his owvn conscience. Great! interests were at stake, and hie felt that the honour and the prestige of the co^untry wvere involved in bringAing the war to a satisfactory conclusion^. Should any further measures be Anecesasry to settle the dispute he should give his sulpport to Lord Palmerston. With reference to reform, he expressed himself favourable to an extension of the franchise, but he would vote against the ballot and ananual Parliaments.
MWr. PxAASA said he didi not intend to detain them with any lengthened description of his ;colitical opinions, as a plain matter did not require a multitude of words. HIe was of opinion that the franehise should be extended. With respect to the ballot5 be did zaot come before them as a ballot-
man, Ouf rom wbint ie had seen durmng the present election he had all but taken the jump into the ballot. With regard to church-rates, ho confessed he was in favour of their entire abolition. A chearg was maede against him that he was a manufacturer and not a farmer. He, however, beliweved that the merchant was the best farmer's friend; for as the manufacturers of the southern division had increased so had the agricultural markets of Darlington and other towns.
A show of hancds was thein taken, which was declared to be in favour of M-Ir. Pease and Lord Harry Vane.
A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Farrer, which will take place on Friday morning.
CUMBERLAND (BAST).
The nomination and election of two candidates to repre sent the eastern division of the county of Cumberland in Parliament took place oa Monday on the *hustings in the market-place, Carlisle, the scene of the recent city election. It was a miserable morning, and the fact of its being a " walk over" diminished the interest the event might otherwise have excited. There were, however, some 300 or 400 persons in front of the hustings.

FORFARSHIRE.
The nomination for this county took place at Forfar on 4londay.
Mr. W. F. Li-sDSAY CARNECIE, of Boysack, proposed, -and Mr. DAivl) GUTICRIE, Provoet of Brechlin, seconded, Viscount Duncan as a fit and proper person to represent the -county.
No other candidate being nominated, Viscount Duncan -was declared duly elected.
Lo.-d DrsctN then addressed the electors. After thanking them for sending him for the third timne to Parliament, -his Lordship said he wished to say a few words in defence of the Governmient, to which he was proud to belong, and which, in his opinion-and he was happy to say in their opinion also-hIad been most unjustly assailed. (flear, hear.) It would be in their recollection that Lord Aberdeen's ,Government went out of office because it was believed they did not adcquately represent the spirit of the nation in regard to the prosecution of the war with Russia. After :Lord Derby, Lord J. lRusseU, and alumost every mnan of note
been applied to to assume the reins of Governmiient, but Aywithout success, Lord Palmerston was placed in office with
)the consent of the Sovereign, and the unanimous voice of '4 peopc. Now, that noble lord had often been assailed as one anxious for war, and inclined to pursue a restless policv. Ile would just ask them, as men of common sense, whether the war had been contimued a moment longer than was absolutely necessary ? He denied that the foreign policy of the Government was a policy that tended to involve Tthis country in unnecessary wars, In proof of which he referred to the amicable solution of the difficulties that bad arisen with the United States and with Persia, and in regard to Switzerlanid. He also claimed credit for the Government -for tho amicable settlement of the Sound Dues question. In evidence of the beneficial effects *f the foreign policy of the present Government on the trade and commerce of this country bia Lordship referred to the vast annual increase of our exports, wvhich last year had reached the enormous amount of 111,000,0001. sterling; and he congratulated the working people of this country especially on the etYect which this had on employment and WageS. Coining to the question of home policy he had often heard the Government assailed as being an extravagant Government. In refutation of this charge he referred to the fact that last year, although the Government were authorized to expend a sum of E0 800,0001., the actual expenditure was only 76.C00I0001., showing that they had no desire to spend a shilling more than was absolutely necessary. Again, this year they had reduced the estimates for the armv, navy, and ordnance by two-thirds; and it was very probable there would be a further reduction in future years, having, however, a due regard to the efficiency offour naval and military establishments, as well as to a generous recognition of the claims of those men who had come forward to serve their country in the time of need. It had been whispered that the Governient were not desirous to extend the suffrage. in contradiction of which he referred to the Scotch Registration of Voters Bill, which had been introduced and carried througls by the LordAdvocate, and which had nearly doubled the burgh constituencies in many places. The noble lord concluded by denouncing the late vote on the Chinese question as a gigantic humbug. (Cheers.)
After a vote of thanks to the Sheriff, the crowd, who had patiently stood for nearly an hour in a drenching rain, dispersed.
MONTROSE.
As announced yesterday, MIr. BAxter was on Tuesday zeturned for the Montrose burghs without opposition.
MIr. BAXTER, in returning thanks, said, he could not help alluding to the recent vote by whichi Lord Palmerston's Government had been defeated. The great point in dispute on which the discussion mainly turned was thelegalpositioii of the lorrha Arrow. Now. wheii he found the ablestlegal members in Parliament differing in opinion as to wvhether she was under British protection or under the protection of the Chinese, he did feel, consideriin" the important consequences involved in the matter, t'hat it was his duty to give the Government the benefit of a doubt. }3e had doie so, and on reflectioin at this distance he felt that if he had to decide again he would do as he had done. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston had seen it his duty to support Sir JT. Bowring, and thus protect life and property, that would hiave been exposed by a contrary course. Tlds of i-self was a sufficient reason to aot as he had, in the circumstances, done; but when he (Mlr. Baxter) found that there was a determination on the part of the opponents of the Government to overthrow it if they could,-when he found whispers in the lobby of the ilouso which made it perfectly clear to him that a factious vote was about to be given by many, he could not besitate to throw his influence, such as it was, into the Ministerial scale. He felt, also, that, out of gratitude to Lord Palmerston for past services, a debt of gratitude was due to him, wvhich ho for one was msost wdlinz, to pay. (Cheers.) And he would continue stiU to g ive him an independent support. It was said that Lord Pt'alhmerston was no Reformer. Well, that remained to be seen. If he did not provo himself a Reformer he should not have his support. It was said, also, thiat the country did not want reformo; that, he thought, was a mistakoe they wanted political, social, and ecclesiastical reform, and when these were demanded on a sure and practical basis he did not think that Lord Palmerston or any other Minister could refuse the country's demands. (Cheers.) They must go forward. Reform and retrenchment must be their motto; and he had no hesitation in expressing his decided conviction that, with such a majority as tho country vould give to Lord Palmnerston, he would find himself warranted in reducing the public expendituire, in equal;ing the public burdens, and in promoting the best interests of the State both at home and abroad. 1Cheers.)

Mr. llasnri F., on coming forward, was received with great cheering and some hooting. He said, from the time he ever becamiie a candidate for this burgh he had advocated a 51. franchise (cheers and hisses), and he saw that this was the utmost that could be conceded. Wlhat was wanted was education to extend the franchise, and witbout education they need iiever hope to have it extenided. He had enjoyed the honour of representing Paisley for 21 years. He had acted conscientiously, and if again elected lie would coiitinue to be actiuated by an earnest desire to promote the best interests of the constituency.
Mr. WoOR DSWORTs 1 addressed the electors at great length, rebutting the charee whieh had been brought against him as the agent of Mir. Hastic, and reiterating his political primci pIlos
Mr. CEujNr EWIN., who was received with great cheering, said, he was in favour of household suffrage and the ballot. Re was in favour of triennial l'arliaments, and, if returned to 1Parliaiiment, he would appear before them every year and give an aconunt of his stewardship; and, further, if he did not give them satisfaction he would resign.

actor has left the stagO (a laugh), and I shall therefore express my -iews in as few words as I possibly can. First, I must refer to a subject of a peculiarly personal character The hon. gentleman who seconded Mr. Bouverie made a reference to my complexion. Now, I think that it is unfair v% hen ladies are present-and there are now ladies in the gallery-to refer to a gentleman's complexion. (Loud laughter.) I have served my country in every quarter of the globe and in all climates, and I may be excused for being a little sunburnt. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) I am not a lily (much laughter) I know, but I appeal to an enlightened con. stituency, and, if I am not out of order, to the ladies in the gallery and ask you, "Am I black?" (Roars of laughter.) That laugh is, I think, an answer to the question. (Renewed laughter.) I now pass from what so nearly touches myself and come to my political principles, and I vil lsay at once that they are no moreblack than is my face. (Renewed laughter.) An hon. gentleman has said that he does not know what a Liberal Conservative is. Now, I am afra that what he does not know would fil a very large book, (Lau&r.) It has been said, also, that I came into Abingdon maVettplace yesterday a Conservative, and left it a Uiberal. Now, that appears to place me in what the Americans call a " fix," (a laugh); but Ithink that I shall be able to place him in a "fix" presently, for I can state that I was not at Abingdon yesterday at el. (" Hear, hear," and loud laughter.) To return to the realquestion. I appear before you on the special requisition of a large and influential body of the electors of Berkshire (hear, hear), gentlemen who are under the impression that there has been a transfer of a Conservative seat from Lord Barrington to Mr. Bouverie (hear), in which they have been allowed no opportunity of having a voice. (Hear, hear.) They think that they have been treated with small consideration and with less courtesy (hear, hear), and they hold the opinion that that Conservative seat is to be transf erred by a compromise. (Hear, hear.) Under these circumstances, they have thought fit to look for a candidate themselves, and their choice having devolved upon me (hear, hear) I am here at their bidding, not from any motive of mere personal ambition, although, indeed, the honour oi being one of the Conservative representatives of one of the most Conservative counties in England is a laudable ambition which any man might honestlyavow. (HIear, hear:) AU electors, and more especially the electors of a county like this, claim as a right not to have their electoral franchise tampered with, and, least of all, do they think that they ought to be ignored by their own palty. (Hear, hear.) That a large party of electors bas determined that such shall not be the case is proved by the invitation sent to me and by my responding to that invitation. Now, allow me, as this is the first time I have appeared before you, although I hope it will not be the last (hear, hear), to say something of my Conservative principles and to run through my articles of faith. (A laugb.) In the last Parliament Izrepresented the borough of C,batham. My brother Sir F. Smith havmng been unseated on petition, a requisition was sent to me by the electors of Chatham, asking me to stand upon Conservatie principles. I accepted the invitation, andstood that contest against the Government interest, and gained the day. (Hear, hear.) I think, then, I may say that I have fought the Conservative battle, and in that battle I caassure you I bled very freely. (Loud laughter.) My speeches and votes in Parliament will show what are my Conservative principles; I will, therefore, only say that I am a Liberal Conservative. [ A Voice.-" What is a Liberal Conservative ?"] Now for an explanation of the term, in order that I may teach that gentleman's young idea how to shoot. (Loud laughter.) My Conservative principles are based upon the British constitution. I have always been and am now prepared to meet the just
requirements of the British public where those requirements are of a distinct and positive moral and sooial advantage, and are not at variance with Conservative principles. (Eear, hear.) That is a Liberal Conservative. (Hear, hear. I hope now the gentleman knows what a Liberal Conservative is, and that he rather likes it than otherwise. (Loud laughter.) I approve of administrative reform, because it tends to place the right man in the right place. (Hear, hear.) I belong to the Royal Engineers, the most scientific corps in the army. It is a corps composed of men with beads on their shoulders (laughter), and with brains in their heads (renewed laughter), and I know weU the advantage of havingthe right man in the right place. (Hear, hear.) In the Crimea the right man was not in the right place; if he had been we should have saved many hard-earned guineas, and spared' many tears to the widows and orphans of those brave men who perished in the Crimnea, not by the sword -for all soldiers have a right to expect a legitimate death by the sword,-but by famine, by disease, by frost, and by everything which wears down the human frame. (Hear, hear.) A dministrative reform would have prevented those evils, and would have led to a most happy result. (Hear, hear.) I am opposed to the Meynooth Grant. (Hear, hear.) A firm supporter of Protestant principles, I dislike anything like a tendency to depart from them. (Hear, hear.) I think that the education of the masses is m;ost conducive to the wellbeing> of the people, and I shall always support any real practical measure for that purpose. To any such a measure IsaU~ give my best attention, because I come from a class which knows the value of education. [A voice"What about China ?"j China!I I will get among that broken ware presently. (Laughter.) I have supported by mny vote the diminution of taxation; and I may say, with regard to all my votes, whether right or wrong, I never fly from my guns (hear, hear); and I have nO apologies to make for them. I am a pli,srirtforward man. That is what the farmers waut an ifthey want that they want me. (loud laughter and cheers.? I gave my vote-I did not pair, I was there ,tcheers)-agamst the aggressive policy which has plunged the countr into a sanguinary war with a barbarous and defence less people, not for the support of a great national principle, but to support the ill-advised and unaulthorised rashness of two civil officers in the East. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman who has just spoken has said that the Government must support its servants abroad. True, when they are right, but not when they are wrong, (Hear, hear.) If the Government were called upon to su1p. port the acts, whether right or wrong, of its executive officers throughout the vast foreign~ possessions of the country, we might at any timne find ourselves, when with our hands in our breeches-pockets we were quietly counting the little money which previous wars had left us, suddenly at war with everybody. (Loud laughter and cheers.) When we were at war with Russia, when the question involved was the honour of the British flag and the suPppOrt of the weak against the strong, I gave my aid to every G overnment, w ithout inquiring who held the reins. The war in China is a miserable contlict between a helpless and a powerftel nation; helpless, I say, because our officers in China say that we shot the Chinese down like n inepins, while they, after iiring thousands of rounds, killed one man and wounded another. (Hear, hear.) I voted both upon the principle that the war wisth China was unjust and because every war is identified with taxation. War taxation is an awkwvard word (laughter), and the taxgatherer is a person hated alike by gods and men. (Roars of laughter.) Nfow, on what class does taxation chietly fall ? The merchant locks up his counting-house, the windows are dimmed and one sees not what is inside. (A laugh.) The capitalist buttons up his pockets, and you don't know what they contam, lint you can't hide the broad acres, you can't conceal the broad shoulders of the British farmer (a laugh), you cannot put the former under a bushel, or put an extin-
giher on the latter. (Loud laughter.) You may attempt o d so, hut I think that this election will show that the British farmer is not to he snuffed out. (Loud cheers.) I have now got into the straight munninpo and will go in with a gallop. [Loud laughter, and a Vosce "And win t "l Yes, and Win. (Renewed cheers and la-ighter.) Shall I tell you the name, weight, and colour of the rider of the winning horse ? (A laugh.) His name is " Vernon," his colour is that of the farmers', and his weight is what you like to place on his hack. (Roars of laughter and cheers.) Mty interests-and it is when you touch his interests that you can really get at a man-are mainly bound up with agriculture; and the interest of the land, which is also your interest, shall -always receive my best attention and support. I think the principle of free trade should be carried further .for the interest of the agricultural classes. I should like to see cheap tea, cheap sugar, and the repeal of the malt-tax. (R7ear, hear.) But what I should most like to see is a readjustment of all those imposts which weigh heavily upon the produce of the soil. (Loud cheers.) If these sentiments are in accordance with your own I can only say that as I have feebly endeavoured to express them on the hustings, so shall I endeavour to forcibly express them before the HouLse of Commons, should you send ine to that assembly. (RIear, hear.) I have now only to thank you for the patient hearing you have accorded me. (Vo0ciferous cheering. )
A show of hands having been taken. the result was declared to he in favour of Mfr. Palmer, Mr. V7ansittart, and Captain Vernon, and a poU1 was accordingly demanded on behalf of Mr. Bouverie.
The poll is fised for Friday next, and the declaration for the following Monday.
HERtTFORDSHJRE.
(FRace OUR OW^5 UEORTER.)
The election of three m.embers to serve in the next Parliamnent for the county of Heorts took place at 11 o'cloek
yesterday, in a field adjacent to the town of Hertford. Until within the last few days a contest had been expected between Mr. Puller, a Liberal, and the late members, who are all Conservatives ; but on the eve of the nomination it got bruited abroad that Mr. Abel Smith, jun., would withdraw his pretensions to the representation, and allow Mr. Puller, who has previously stood for the coulnty without success, to obtain undisputed possession of one of the seats. It is well known that negotiations were recently entered into between the Liberal Election Committee and the Conservative Registration Association of Herts, for the purpose of securing a third share of the county representation to the Liberal interest, on the understanding that the Conservatives should be allowed to retain quiet possession of the rest, and a solemn compact to effect that object was formally concluded between the two political parties The arrangement involved the retirement of one of the Con. servative exn-members, who had previously agreed to place themselves in the hands of a committee appointed to determine which of the three should make way for Ir. Puller; andit so happened that the decision come tomaited out the senior member, Sir H. Meux, for this act of self-sacrifice Sir Henry, however, refused to be made the victim, maintaining that it was very unfair to expect such selt-aboegation from him, and exempt his junior colleagues; and he accordingly proceeded to canvass the constiuency in defiance of the resolution of the Conservative Association. A good deal of angry controversy was provoked by these transactions,! the Liberals insisting on holding their opponents to the strict terms of their bond, and demanding that if Sir H; Meux persevered in Isis contumacy, one of his late colleagues Ahould retire instead of him. This anomalous state, of
things continued up to the hour of nomination, causing no ;ittle scandal in the county. How it was terminated will ba gathered from the proceedings about to be repotted.
A large ooncourse of tenant-farmers and townspeopl) assembled in front of tho hustings, the ground being half enoircled by carriages and waggons, which were occupied by the higher class of spectators.
The writ having been read,
Mr. W. REED, the High Sheriff, claimed for everyone -who might speak a fair and impartial hearing.
Mr. BETTS then proposed, and Mr. WYsr seconded, the no-ination of Sir H. Meux.
Mlr. ABEm SMITH, jun., before nominating Sir E. B. Lytton, wished to explain the peculiar position in which he was himself placed. Sir H. Maux had been proposed and seconded, and his intention to go to the poll had been declared. For his part, he (Mr. Smith) refused to be put in nomination. An honourable agreement had been entered into to concede one seat to the Whig party. It was not for him to defend that agree ment; he was not responsible for it anymore than Sir H. Meux. But it certainly depended upon the word of a gentleman (A Voice-"No compact"), and he had waited till the last moment to enable Sir H. Meux to do that which was in accordance with his own pledge. He (Sir H.) had however thought fit to do otherwise. ("He has repudiated.") The engagement with the Whiz partyremained, and that engagement must be car ried out ("Bravo ") The Conservative party wereboundto fulfil it. (You had Do right to make it.") That party had always been distinguished for high chivalrous feeling and a fine sense of honour, and he was willing, in order to save that honour and to fulfil that engagement, to sacrifice his owvn personal ambition and sever the ties of that connexion which he held so deer. (Cheers.) Throughout his canvass he had been received with a cordiality and a kindness which he had no rightto expcect; and he confidently, but respectfully, ap. pealed to them wvhether he had not served them faithfully' and diligently in Parliament. (Cheers.) He had not deserted the good old blue colours. His votes showed him to have been a stanch and consistent supporter of the Protestant and Conservative principles he was elected to uphold. Without presuming to enter there into any defence of his Parhamentary conduct le wished brieey to allude to his vote on the China question. All he declared by that vote was that the papers laid on the table of the House did not give satisfactory grovud for the violent pro* ceedings of our agents ab Canton-proceedings which he held to be cruel and unjust. That was the conscientious conclusion to ivhichhehadcomeaftertho most careful perusal of the documents, and the last news received from China confirmed it. (" No, no.") The Emperor now disavowed Commissioner Yeh, and if time had only been allowed to sendto Peldn for instructions, how many lives would have been spared, and how much property saved! However, he (Mr. Smith) had acted on his convictions, and whether right or wrong he cared not for the consequences. (" Oh oh !"1) He was vain enough to hope that lhe might be permitted to appear before them again as a candidate on some future occasion. (Cheers.) At all events, he trusted that his present retirement would assuage those differences, and that bitterness of feeling whioh he feared recent circumstances had engendered. (Hear, hear.) It now only remained for him to fulfil the task that he had undertaken. Hertfordshire had been proud, and would stiU be proud, to have Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton to represent it. (" No," and "Yes, yes.") Sir Edward had faithfully served them in the last Parliament; he had nobly maintained their interests in the House of Commons, where he stood forth in the front of the battle. The hon. bart. would excuse him if, under the peculiar circums'ances of the case, he failed to do him justice - but he was sure he would not appeal to them in vain when he asked them to renew to him their confidence and support. (Cheers.) Mr. Smith then nominated Sir E. B. Lytton, Bart., as a fit and proper person to represent the county in Parliament, and retired trom the front of the hustings amid vociferous applause.
MIr. E. RoBERrs, in seconding the nomination, said he did not support Sir Edward as a party man. It was not for them to send mere puppets to Parliament, but men of independence and integrity, whom they must leave in the main to act according to the dictates of their own judgment. He would not say whether Sir Edward was right or wrong in voting against the Chinese war; but great as was his own abhorrence of bloodshed, he would be the last man to truckle to those who insulted the British flag. (Cheers.) The speaker then vehemently denouncedtheMaynooth grant, and maintained that it was derogatory to Parliament to vote such an annual payment, as recommended by The T2imes, on the ground of expedienoy. Why should the country give
0,0001. a-year to educate Roman Catholic priests, when we had abundance of them continually issuing from Oxford and Cambridge? The doctrines and principles of the Puseyltes and those of the Roman Catholics were identical in their leading features. (A Voice.-" Go to the breadand-butter question, and leave religion alone.") He rejoiced that the vote of Sir E. B. Lytton stood recorded against this abomination. Mr. Roberts next eulogized Lord Palmerston's ecclesiastical appointments, and concluded by expressing his belief that it would be difficult to find a man who could conduct public affairs in a critical period with so much wisdom, zeal, and satisfaction to the country as the present Premier had done. (Liud cheers.)
The Hon. W. CoNVPER, MLP., &aid that it appeared,
from what had fallen from Mr. Abel Smith, that they were likely, on that occasion, to elect three knights of the shire by the more ancient and tranquil formality of a show of hanrds rather than by the more complicated and sometimes exasperating formality of a polL (Hear, hear.) He must therefore refer a little to the circumst3nces which had brought them to that issue. Objections had been .aised to what some persons chose to call " a compromise." He had never given it that name. The proper designation of what had occurred was "a truce," " a treaty of peace." (A Voice.-" We are sold.") He called it a wise and prudent acquiescence in the existing state of facts-a transaction of which those who originated it had no reason to be ashamed. Eleotioneering had been often compared to military warfare, and every war, whatever the relative success with which it was waged by either party, invariably ended in a treaty of peace. In 1852 they fought on these hustings the battle of free trade; and though defeated, they did not lose courage, but gave each other pledges that they would again rally round the old banner, and do their best to win the day on a future occasion. In a subsequent year they fought the battle of Liberalism against Conservatism; and though again defeated they still did not lose courage, but determined to persevere. Those two great struggles had at length attained their natural and proper result-a treaty of peace. (Cheers, and some dissent.) Many persons liked a contest and many also disliked it. To begin with the latter, they were men who wished to avoid stirring upantagonism between different classes; who did not want to set landlords against tenants, customers against tradesmen, or friends against friends. Those, on the other hand who were eager for a contest were the sanguine men, who were always going to be victorious uutil they saw their candidate at the bottom of the poll. (A laugh.) The lawyers, publicans, beershop-keepers, and brewers were seldom opposed to a contest (renewed laughter), and so were all who sought pecuniary profit-alU who liked amusement at other people's expense -all who were proud of displaying their eloquence by haranguing the multitude from a window. (A Voice.-" You forget those who are to be bought for money," and laughter.) He had had so little to do with the class who sought money bribes for their votes that he had entirely overlooked them. (Laughter.) He begged humbly to apologize to all those persons for having been instrumental, with others, in depriving them of the pleasure and advantage they might have anticipated from a contest. (Renewed laughter.) The treaty of peace was honourable to those who had entered into it. Those who had most knowledge of the feelings of the constituency were of opinion that the conclusion to be arrived at that day without a contest would be identically the same as they would have arrived at with one. If there had been a poll Mr. Puller, as a supporter of Lord Palmerston's Government, would doubtless have been returned, while the influenice and organization of the Blue party would have secured for them two seats. Nobody would lose anything but those whom he had enumerated by their being spared the turmoil, the agitation, the animosity, and the expenditure-(" You have hit it now," and laughter)-that must necessarily accompany a disputed election. The agreement was now as honourablyfulfilled as ithad beenhonourablymade, and every creditwasduetoMr.Smithforsacrificinghispersonalambition to a sense of what was right. That gentleman would retire into private life with the esteem and regard of all present. Sir E. B. Lytton had also kept his agreement ; but he now came to a third candidate on whom he could not pass the same eulogium. (" Yes, yes," "No, no," and confusion.) He should deeply regret saying anything that could wound any man's feelings; but as. an elector and a public man, discussinlg the public conduct of one of his representatives, he should be guilty of false delicacy and of timidity in the discharge of his duty if he did not plainly speak his mind. (Hear, hear.) Sir H. Moux had a perfect right to refase
his concurrence in the agreement that Was made; and if he had done that he would have acted in a straightforward manner. ("Oh, oh," and cheers.) Again he might have assented to the agreement, with the proviso that the withdrawing member was not to be him, but one of his colleagues. If he had taken that course he (Mr. Cowper) would have had no objection to offer. Sir r. Moos, in his own written statements, acknowledged that heat first agreed unconditionally to place his resignation in the hands of a certain number of gentlemen whom he concurred in appoinling, and that afterwards, when it occurred to him that they might very likely select bim as the retiring member, he begged to be off his agreement, and sent to them to say that he would no longer abide by it. (" Quito right, too.") Thus he endeavoured, without the consent of the other contracting parties, to withdraw from the engagement into which he had entered. (Hear, hear.) Such conduct he (Dfr. Cowper) must, in his individual capacity utterly repudiate, denounce, and condemn. (Cheers.) Whether a man was a horny-handed labourer earning his daily bread by the sweat of bis brow, or whether he occupied the proud position of a country gentleman of England'who ought to set an example to all beneath him of unsullied honour his word should bo. his bond, and his enggements !:should be fulfi6led with fidelity. (Cheers.) He would say no more on this pain,ful sabject; but the interests and the honour of Hertfordshire and, let him add, the interests of public morality, required him te say no less. (Hear, hear.) He passed nowto amore pleasing task,-that of nominating a gentleman well quali fed to represent the o,pinions of at least the wisest portion of that constituency. ('No, no," and laughter.) They would pardon him if he had extolled his friend too highly. He a onowledged tbat the Conservative party might be very wise, but for the life of him ho could never find their wisdom out. (A laugh) The hon. gentleman concluded by nominating Mir. Chri.- topher W. Puller for the representation of that county.
MIr. WisLExw seconded thenomination.
No other candidate being put in nomination
The SHERiI;yp amid loud cheers, then declared Sir H.
Meux, Bart., SirE. B. Lytton, Bart., and Mr. C. W. Puller duly elected to serve in the next Parliament.
Sir H. MEux then presented himself to the meeting, and was warmly cheered. He said that he was very much obliged to them for the way in which they had receivea him. He was also deeply grateful for the equally kind reception they had given to him in every district that he had canvassed. He would certainly support Lord Palmerston in conduoting the Chinese war, and he would also vote for all the Premier's good measures. (Cheers.) The BEuperor of China appeared to be readybto make peace with this country on any terma His opinons relative to Iaynooth were the same as they always had been. The public money voted for that institution had been spent quite uselessly. (Eiear, hear.) HIe wvould only now repeat his hearty thanks to them all for what they had done for him. (Cheers.)
Sir B. B. LYTToN was greeted with lond cheers, mingled with some disapprobation. He said,-CGentlemen, whatever difference of opinion may exist among us upon other maatsrs, I do think that every Englishman of sound feelings in this assembly will concur in one common sentiment of admiration for that example of generosity and of honour which Mr. Abel Smith has this day placed before the eyes of the whole country. (Cheers.) Every sacrifice of personal ambition, from high and noble motives, mnst come home to theheartsof Englishmenwherevertheymeet together; andby the side of that sacrifice I thinkthat all irritating allusions to those local misunderstandings which have embittered this election would be in equally bad taste and bad feeling. (Cheers.) Indeed, it seerms to me that any lengthened or angry reference even to political and party discussions would be somewhat unseasonable and out of place. Gentlemen, at this time many a fierce and anxious contest is being fought throughout the kingdom, and many a political veteran will receive the congratulations of his friends on his triumphart return; but I do not think that among them all there is one who will be more envied by a generous nature than your owrn late young member foz Hertfordshire, who in the very heat of the struggle, and while he had every reasonable prospect of success (",No, no !"), stops sbort, and, in order to maintain and cement the peace of his friends and his party, and to vindicate their honour, gives place to one of his colleagues and steps forth to propose another. (Cheers.) I am sure that his magnanimity will have this reward, that it lifts him high above the acrimonious altercations of the moment into the lasting gratitude of his party and the esteem of all men; and the day will come when he will not have a rival to challenge his claim to your suffrages. (Eear, hear.) He has given way not from any ignoble fears of a defeat, but from fidelity to an honourable engagement. Gentlemen, I will not deprive that scrifice of the object for which it is made. That is to say, I will not enter into irritating discussions on those unhappy mis. conceptions which I could fain hope would be buried in oblivion, and of which I could scarcely attempt to remove the acerbity without incurring the risk of provoking fresh recriminations. If there is to be no contest, at least let there be no anger. (Hear, hear.) But there is one point to which I must allude, partly because it touches myself personally, and partly, also, because it is due to the memory of your old representative, Mr. Halsey. I have heard it widely reported, but I am sure it can never have been authorized by Sir H. Meux, that in the election of 1852 Sir H. Meux paid some portion of the expenses of Mr. Halsey, and I suppose it is implied-although no man has ventured to tell me so to my face-that Sir Henry Meux also paid a portion of mine. That charge, if true, would subject me to the imputation of ingratitude and meanness. But here, in the face of Sir H.
ileux, and in the face of all who may have heard or credited that report, I give the allegation my most flat and unqualified contradiction. (Hear, hear.) I deny that Sir H. Meux ever contributed towards my election expenses; nor would I ever stand in any contest in which I was assisted by mv fellow candidates. (Cheers.) That there maybe no doubt on this subject here is the letter of the chairman of our committee, which I am permitted to read. It is dated Grosvenor-scjuare, Marc4 29th, 1857, and it states that " Sir H. Meux paid his own one-third of the election expenses of 1852. He did not pay anything towards yours or Mr. Ealsey's. I have kept the accounts and the banker's books, all of which I am ready to produce." (Hear, hear.) I hope that after that this story is at last dead, and that we shallnever again be hauntedbyits ghost. (Cheers and a laugh.) There is another point to which, without casting any harsh or painful redections upon the conduct of my late and present colleague, Sir H. Meux, I wish for a moment to refer. It is with respect to those gentlemen who were authorized by a public meeting-(A. Voice.-"It was private.")-to enter into those considerations with which a public meetin_ could not conveniently deaL (Interruption.) Well, I will only say this,-Let me take from among yoa several persons who may be the personal friends of Sir H. Meux, who at that time was suffering heavily, and suppose they had heard on all sides, from those who loved h'i. most, that it might be desirable for his speedy and oomplete restoration to health that he should have a short respite from the cares and anxieties of public life. Then I put it to your own hearts whether they might not have come to the decision that three candidates from our party should not be brought forward because one candidate whom they loved and esteemed might be unfit for the severity and the fatigues of a contest; and having come to the determination to request him to withdraw-a determination which I entreat you to consider that they did not arrive at on the Saturday after they received his letter desiring to retract, but on that very Thursday. after which tbme they dispersed and entirely ceased to be a committeeI ask you to say whether they might not have been actuated by a sincere affection for him, just as one brother might press another to curb the dictates of his own high spirit and counrage, that ho night regain erfect health and strength? Well, this and this alone was the paramount object of those who advised Sir R Meux. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, after the excitement produced by these local disagreements, and warmed as I feel, in common, I am sure, with you all, by the magnanimity of Mr. Smith, I think that any lengthenedreference to partypDlitics mustbeinsipidand unseasonable. And, after all, if we look to the addresses of the various candidates throughout the Idngdom, it would seem as if it were likely there would be no opposition at all in the next Parliament, and as if we were all to be one happy family, united in unqualified confidence and harmony under that patriarchal Minister who announces nothing and therefore commits nobody. (A laugh.) The universal cry would appear to be "Palmerston, the whole Palmerston, and nothing but the Palmerston." Just before Lord EPalmerston was going to dine at the Mansion-house the other day I met one of his friends and supporters, who said to me, " Don't you think it very unlucky that the Prime Minister should be obliged to accept the Lord Mayor's invitation? Why, after that speech from Lord J. Russell, and that other spch from Lord Derby, Lord Palmerston will have to declare himself on some definite policy, and that is exceedingly unlucky, because if he leans to the ConservativF he will lose some support in the boroughs, and if lie leans to the Liberals he Will lose soule support in the counties. It is really a very hard case." Laughter.) "Certainly," I replied, "it may be very unfortunate if a Minister of England is required to express himself clearly with regard to any definite policy but, then, you need not be alarmed; Lord Palmerston is much too clever a man to commit himself; and you may be certain he will not let the cat out of the bag until he is quite sure on which side of the House it will jump in the next Parliament." (Laughter.) Therefore, while I have the utmost respect for the opinions of the gentleman who so kIndly seconded me to-day, he will still allow me to say that I should be a very incautious politician if I were to declare at once, wibhout knowing in the least what his policy is to be, that I should give to Lord Palmerston an unqualified support. (Hear, hear.) At the same time I think the country has decided that the present Premier shall have a fair, candid, and impartial trial; and I believe it is the interest and the duty of every party to afford him that triaL (Cheers.) MIr. Cowper, from the height of that transcendant genius which he apparently arrogates to himself and his party, says that he not only greatly doubts the wisdom of the Conservative party, but he thinks they are very much behindhand with those great Whiggentlemen who when out of office have always the word progress on their liNs, but who when they are in Downing-street don't seem to me to wish to progress any further. ALaughter.) If Yo wgill refer to the part I took in common with the Conservative parby for the revision of the income-tax, when I proposad, with the sanction of the great body of my political friends, to establish a distinction
etwveen the profits of precarious industry and incomes derived from realized property, you will see that that motion was supported by the great bulk of the Conservatives, while I believe the friends of Mr. Co er opposed it. You may also remember the course which Itook, in conjunction with the Conservatives, for the reduction of half the malttax. Well, then, it was the friends of Mr. Cowper-the go-ahead gentlemen-(a laugh) who resisted it. Again, itw as I who, with the consent and approval of the Conservative party, induced the House of Commons to pledge itself to administrative reform. If you likewise consider the humble but earnest part which I took in concert with al the Conservatives in pressing Minister after Minister, and Cabinet after Cabinet-in every one of which Lord
.almerston was a member-to vigour in the prosecution of the war and to honour in the terms of peace, any candid man among you must allow that, whatever may be the faults of the Conservatives, they are not obsolete politicians-that they do not less love the people because they revere the institutions by which that people have won their liberties and their renown. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I do not complain that the House of Commons has been dissolved, but I complain that it has been dissolved upon false pretences. (Hear.) If the Government had told us at the time that they were about to send forth a Plenipotentiary to China of the just and humane principles for which Lord Elgin is distinguished there would have been no majority against them, and therefore no necessity for a dissolution. If that resolution was the consequence of our vote, then the vote itself is vindicated. If, on the other hand, the Government had predetermined upon it, they ought to have acted fairly and ingennuously by the House of Commons, and also by their own fiiends, in which case, I again say, no majority would have been recorded against them. And what was the House of Commons whioh has been thus unfairly dealt with and hastily dissolved? Why it is the same assembly which stooi eo firmly by the Crown and the people throughout the whole of the Russian war; it is the assembly which kept the Minister firm, and not the Minister who kept that assembly firm, in the prosecution of the war; it is that assembly which you allowed to pour forth your resources, when that was necessary, with an unntinted hand, and along whose every bench you could not have looked, a few short months ago, without seeing a father in mourning for a son whom he had lost in defence of his country-it is that House of Commons which is to be insulted and branded br the charge of inclifference to the honour of the nationa flag. (Cheers.) Is that fair-is it honest-is it ingenuous ? And is it Lord Palmerston who can justy appeal to the country gentle-
xmea and Conservatives of England for their support. when ho could-in a moment of haste, I am sure-say that
Lure, and the repeal of the income-tax, under which the
country had so long groaned. He was generally opposed to | the policy of Lord Palmerston, but his opposition would be independent, and not fatious.
Mr. BALL appealed to his past votes in the House of Commons as a guarantee of what he would do for the future, and especiaUy alluded to his abandonment of Protection when he was convinced, though he was sent to Parliaiaent to support it by the votes of 450 members against 50, that it was no longer tenable. He was conscientiously a Dissenter, but would never give a vote that would tend to weaken the Church of England, as he thought it would require all the strength of the Protestants in this country consolidated to contend against the common enemy. Mr. Ball expressed himself as against any measure compelling the farmer to return agricultural statistics to Government as likely to operate injuriouslv to their interests, and in favour of the education of the people by any means, provided it was founded on religion; but he thought all education dangerous that was not founded on the word of God.
Mr. ADEANE (who next to Mr. Ball was the most popular candidate) expressed himself as decidedly in favour of the Palmerstonian policy, for the abolition of church-rates, and in their stead the maintenance of the fabrics of the church out of the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. He was opposed to the ballot and to Maynooth, but in everything else was a " thorough Liberal."
A poll was demanded on behalf of Lord George Manmers, and fixed for Friday next.
BEDFORD (COUNTY).
Most unexpectedly the opinion of the electors is to be taken by polL The Liberals are determined not to let the opportunity pass without an attempt to return another Liberal memnber to sit with Mr. Hastings Russell. The nomination took place yesterday, when Sir George Osborn, the HIigh Sheriff, presided.

The greatest excitement prevails.
STAFFORDSHIRE (SOUTH).
The nomination of candidates to represent this division of the county took plaee at Lichfield yesterday.
Mr. MATHEWS nominated Mfr. W. IL Foley as a gentleman of Liberal principles and deserving the confidence of the electors.
The nomination was seconded by Mr. H. WALxxl, of Wolverhampton.
Mr. C. FORSTER, M-P. for Walsall, nominated Mr. Wil liam Orme Foster, of Stourton Castle.
Mr. G. BARKER, of Wolverhampton, seconded the nomination.
No other canditate being proposed, the High Sheriff declared Mr. Foley and Mr. Foster duly elected. (Loud eheers.)
Mr. FOLEY, after thanking the electors for the honour conferred Upon hirn, said he was a Liberal in every sense of the word. le was one of those who thought that there was no finality in the British constitution, and would by his votes endeavour to keep pace with the requirements of the nation. He was for an enlargement of the suffrage, vote by ballot, and, as a member of the Church of England, while he would see provision made for maintaining the fabric of churches, would vote for the entire abolition of churchrates.
Mr. FOSTER, in returning] thanks, observed that a debt of gratitude was owing to Lord Palmerston for the courage and ability with which he had conducted the country through the late war, and particularly more reeently for his conduct on the Chinese question. But with regard to the future he would saythathe looked forsomepracticalmeasures | of domestic improvement, and he was satisfied that neither
Lord Palmerston nor any other statesman would be ablo to maintain office unless he satisfied the expectations of the country. He was not only for an extension of the suffrage, but for the settlement of the question by some bold measure which would satisfy the country. He should like to see a measure associated with the ilustrious name of Russell and the question thus set at rest for some
ears to come. Personally he did not like the vote y ballot, but if constituencies required it for their protection he would vote for it. Wie would not support any system of education from which the religious element is excluded. (Hear, hear.) If a great constituency liked to return a Jew he, for one, would open the doors of Parliament to-day. He would not vote for the disaUowance of the grant to Maynooth, and would suprt anmeasure for the abolition of church-rates, althon athe fbrics of churches ought, in his opinion, to be maintained by the parishioners.
A vote of thanks having been voted, the Court broke up.

NOTTlNGHAMSHIRllj (NORTH).
*,The election of two representatives for the northern division of the county of Nottingham took place yesterday at Mansfield. Mr. J. E. Denison was brought forward to supply the vacancy made by the retirement of Lord Henry Bentinck, and Lord Clinton again offered himself. There was no other candidate, and the proceedings exhibited little general interest.
Colonel WILDL;IAN nominated Lord Robert Pelham Clinton, and Mr. HAxNAY seconded his Lordship.
Mr. C. PAGEr, M.P., in the accidental absence of Captain Saville. placed Mr. J. Evelyn Denison in nomination, and
Mr. R. BIRKIN seconded the nomination.
After the Sheriff had declared the two members duly elected,
Lord CLINTON addressed the electors, and defended the votes he gave on the China question and the Budget. Hle said he should most faithfully and rigidly adhere to the principles of religious and political liberty, which they had a second time elected him to represent. (Cheers.) Now that Ministers had got rid of war-for he was happy to hear that the Chinese dispute was over-he hop they would turn earnest their attention to home legislation. Any fair measure for educating the people would have his support, it being his opinion that voluntary aids were not sufficient for that purpose. He was in favour of an extension of the suffrage, and the only reason why he did not support Mr. Locke Bing's motion was, that he thought the alteration heproposed ought to form one of the orovisions of a general comprehensive measure of reform. Ife should never sanction such a desecration of the Sabbath as existed on the continent, but to a measure for opening certain public places and institutions on the Sunday, as proposed by Sir J. Walmaley, now no longer a member of Parliament, he would give his support. (Cheers.) On the last occasion when he asked their suffrages he told them that he was against the ballot, and he still thiought it would not conduce to the good of the country. Those were the only questions on which he felt it necessary to address them, and he warmly thanked them for the honour they had done him by a second time appointing him their representative.
Mr. DiusISON said he was not among them to disturb the peace of the county, or to move any one fzom his seat, but simply to avail himself of a vacancy in their representation. It was only after repeated applications, and not until within four days of the dissolution, that he consented to offer himself. Had Lord Henry Bentinck again come forward he (Mr. Denison) of course should bave entered into no contest, even though three-fourths of the electors had requested him to stand. No communication in any shape, either in writing or by word of mouth, had passed between himself and the Duke of Portland with reference to that election up to that moment. The representation of that great constituency had become more easy since the final settlement of the question of protection, and he was happy in coming amiong them. (Cheers. ) ie should keep a sharp eye upon the ntional expenditure,for it was with nations as with individuals-there must be a well-lined breeches pocket and a good balance at the bankers to make things go smoothly. (Bear.) Hfe was willing to extend the franchise in accordance with the growth of intelligence; and for that purpose he was ready to support any satisfaetory measure ot education. (A Voice.-" Will you support Locke King's motion ?") He would answer that question. He was in favour of every 101. householder in counties having a vote (cheers); but not every person paying 10l. for house and land. In the latter case he did not think the payment of that amount of rent would be any
§uarantee for the possession of intelligence or independence.
H ear, hear. ) He had received a letter complaining that h~ had not mentioned the church in his address, but he hX expressed his desire to preserve the constitution of the country, among the institutions of which he included that of the established churoh. (Hear, hear.) If that churchwhich could not be mentioned without recollection of its dissensions-eclined in the affections of the people it would be attributable to those of her members wvho were dissatisfied with the aimplicity of her formula, and wished to restrict the circle of her toleration. (Cheers). With regard to the quesion of affairs in China, he was quite satisfied with the explanation given by his noble friend, whom he mighat now call his noble colleague, of his vote on the occasion, but more they would not expecb himnto say, for if he said Lord Clinton was right he must admit that the opposite vote which he himself gave was wrong. (Laughter.) If, however, it should be found that at the timne the House of Commons was urginghWinisters to call upon SirJ. Bowring to make an apology to Commissioner Yeh the Emperor of China was ordering Commissioner Yeh to apologize to Sir ga oweri, thuldbe omedy onf"Cross P ses" wouad have

LANCA3hIRE (NORTH).
The noination and deltion toolo plse yesterday'in the" Shire-ba2l, LancaSer, which wa" filled, Theceadidates were Colonel J. Wilson Patten, who has reprenented the constitueacy 25 year-, and Lord Cavendisb, eldest son of teaBzlof Burlington, of Hohkw-lUl,who aS boiz foc-
Esufrage and the ballot. Tn respect to the first, he had
voted for Mr. Locke King's motion; but in respect to| the second, he did not believe the ballot would afford that safety to the voter its advocates anticipatedansd, moreover, there would be a fear of tampering with the returns by the Government of the day; at least, such had been found to be the case in America, where it had been tiied. The opponents of LordPalmerston, who accusedhim of having a turbulent and aggressive polioy, ignored the facts of his having concluded an honourable peace with Russia, of his having avoided a war with America, and of the pacific termination of the Persian diQficulty. Hoe (tIc. Eoward) was a stanch advocate of p~ublic education and the more equal distribution of church property. It Nias monstrous, in his opinion, that the wrrorking clergy should be so miserably paid, while there were so manyprich sinecurels n the est,ablishment.
Mr. PoRTME asked Mr. Howard what his opinion was upon the subject of church-rates?
iMr. HOWsAiD.-I voted in favour of Sir W. Clay's motion. (Hear, hear.
Mfr. CAarnIoR asked him if he would take up Mr. Fergasson's Carlisle Canonries Bill ?
Mr. HoWARD would not promise to do tbat.
Mr. MARsEALL then thanked his constituents. It was a mistake to suppose Lord Palmerston was not a Reformer. [A.Voice.-"What does Jemmy Graham say ?"] (Laughter.) Hle was a very old Reformer. [A. Voice.-"a n very deep disguise, then."] (Laughter.) At any rate, let them judge by his actions; [" We do ;"] let theni see what measures he would bring forward in the next session, and if he did not fulfil their expectations he (Mr. Marshall) wrould not give the noble lord his support. (Cheers.) Referring to Chias, Mr. MWarshall spoke of the great advrantages to both that nation and this in the establishment of more estended friendly and commercial relations, and which, he believed, would be secured by the present war. Lastly, he spoke of the great advantages of agriculturd statistics.
On the motion of Mr. P. H. HowAlD, of Corby-castle, a vote of thanks to the High Sheriff terminated the proceed. ings..
NORTHAMPTONTSHIRE (NORTH).
Yesterday we gave a brief account of the nomination for this connty, when Mr. Stafford and Lord Barghley were declared duly elected. We row supply a more lengthened report of the proceedings. Inthe couse of the morning thxe following handabill was extensively circulated:
"RUBBISH AND RII-NRAFS.

Brother Electocs,-Have you forgottenthe Crimean coa1nty, when the nation was filled with horror by 310O0 of our veteran soldier,

"'Sir B. HALT' SPBEECH iu the HOUSE of COMMONS, April

H"He found that the Secretary of the Airaity arived ar Devon. port in the Black Eagle on Tueday, June 2,12l2. Th e election took plae about a fortnight after. On Wednesday, June 21a, he walkei round the dockyard arm in arm with the two Oonservative candidates. They then stood together at the Muser-oSica, where the man aeposit their tickets on leaving the yard. so that each man. singly, must pag before them. In the evening of the same day the secretary gave a dinner In Moreshead's Hotel, at which were present the two Conserva. tive candidatas, the chairman of their committee at Sotouehouse, tbe two attorns actinrg as electioneering agents for the Tory candidates, the cha'man of the Committee of the Tory candidite at Plymouth, and a 3fr. Tusott. storekeeper of the Victualling-ad, who was a most active partisan, and canvassed the voters in the yard ni favour of the Tor, candidates. Wa3 not this an elestioa
dinner given by the hou. gentleman? (Uesy, hear.) It Certainly a3sumed thst oharacter. If it was necessary for the hon. gentleman to make that voyage and to superintend the dockyard, it was his duty to have gone thera solely as the servant of the ptblic, free from political connexlorn, and wholy unconnected with provincial politcians (iEear' hear.) He begged to ask (and ha hope some answer would be giren to his question) whether the account for this dinner was entered among the Admiralty contingencies.

Air. HAY'a EXAMINATION before the PARLIAMENTARY

*'Mr. Hay, Chief Clerk of the Admuialty, was thou examined by
Sir B. Hall, who asked whether the expenaes of Mr. Stafford, as Secretary to tho Board, on his visit in the Black Eagle to Devonport, last June, had not been paid under the head of contingencies,

"I Sr. Hay.-I do not (renewed sensation).
"'We apprehend itwould be diffoult to and a asse where more and more varied publio deiiquencles had been crowded into a simlrst spame of time.'-The Times."
Mr. Stafford and Lord Bnrghley were then declared duly elected.
Mr. STAFFORD came forward to address the electors; but what with the groaning, the jeering, and the noisy interrogatories with which the hon. gentleman was greeted some time elapsed before he was able to make himself heard. At length, the good humour of the crowd prevailing, they deemed it proper to listen to what their representatives had to say to them, and, accordingly, Mr. Stafford proceeded:
Gentlemen, you have asked mne some questions, and I shall be very glad to answer them (applause). But you must be aware I have only one throat, and so, if you all halloa at me together, my only resource is to make my bow to you and go away (cries of "hear him"). Gentlemen, I thank you most heartily for having returned me as your member to ParBment again (groans, and a cry of "You are not our member"). cowu gentlemen, some of you wish to ask me a few qudsctions. Well, askrme 00if pouwillonly letthembe lain and audible to every one. (" Then what d about the dock yards (") When I came herethis morning one of my friends put this placard into my haud (the hon gentlemean referred to the handbill which has been insertedeabove), and, of course, I read it, as tam heoud to read every squib wthich comes cut r.pon such an Occasion as the present. But, gentlemen, I can assure you it does not do for me what that cloud (it had just commenced raining) is now doing-that is, it throws no cold water upon me, for I am prepared to an'. ser it. (Groat cheering, and cries of " Put your hat on.") Gentlemen, the only practical difference between myself and Lord Palmerston is that he spoke to his constituents with his hation and am going to speak to you,if you please, with my hat off. (Laughter.) For the sentiments expressed in that speech nere sO just, so patriotic, and so wise that if I wanted a proftessio of political faith I could not have found one more pradently or more temperately expressed, and at the same time more ample, thanthat which was made at Tiverton by the man who holds the office of Prime Minister of England. Wuel, now then for the "Black Esgie." The writer of this handbill, quoting from a leading articl in b e Tinmes newspaper, in allusion to this affair of the Black Eagle, says, " It would be difflcult to find a case where more anld more varied public delinquencies had been crowded into a similar spase of thme." Well, gentlemen, I say it would not be at all diicult. (A4pplause.) But those who know what The Timer is, those wvho know how ably it writes to smuit its particular purpose, and those who have seen what oe aioes has said of me since will be disposed to receive with a considerable amnount of abatement such a quotation as this. (Cheers.) But what are these delinquences of which of e Times compiains ? This anonymous writer quotes the examination of a gentleman who is since do. ceased, which says that 4Sl. ais. 6d. was paid by the G;overnment for the entertainment of my friends on the occasion of my going down to Plymouth on board the Black Eoagle. (Jeers and roans.) Well, it is verytrue that a boll of 48S. 15s. 6d. was sent in to the Admiralty, and was charged i the publc accoonts; but, gentlemen, I deny that either through that bill, or in any other way, the country w as put to one farthing's expense for the entertainmnent of my private friends, (Great applause.) I will tell you how this was. I am sure you wvill believe me when I state openly, and upon my honour, that I refunded every farthing of that money unsolicited, uncompelled, which went to the entertainment of my friends. (Cheers, and a voice in the crowd, " Show us the bill re. ceipted?") In the Admiralty amcounts it was impossible at tbe moment to separate bMils of varioUs kinds, and that will account for the mistake which happened. And, let me add, those who were entertained were naval officers, without distinction of party, and those who dined with me I paid for myself. (Applause.) Therefore, not denying the evidence of Mr. Bay, think it is calculated to remind you that half the truth is very nearly, if not a whole falsehood, at least a whole mistake. You may believe me, then, not one farthing of the money has been charged to the expenses of the State; and I have in my possession a letter from the Admiralty acknowledging the receipt of the money I sent, and recognizing me as fully acquitted of the charge which had been brought forward, (A Voice-" Would you have refunded if you had not been found out ?") (Laughter.) It was very easy for Sir Ben. jamin Hal! to get up in his place and move for a select committee, but he did not prove his case. The very essence of his move was that he should prove his case, and he did not fail to range matters in the strongest light against me. Well, he moved for a committee, and he oh. luined a commttee, and 'the committee made a repoort to
which the attention of the House was called. To the doci-.
sion of the House of Commons upon that occasion I have no 1 reason to object, for I was acquitted by it. (Cheering.) nut, again, you are asked have you forgotten the Crimean calamity, when the nation was filled with horror bv 30,000 of our soldiers perishing miserably. Gentlemen, I have not forgotten the Crimean calamity, whatever others may have done. (Great cheering.) But it is not for me to boast how far I had a share in mitigating the excess of that calamity, and in administering to the comfort of our poor soldiers in hospital, and in endeavouring to solace the sick bed of those poor men when far away from their native land, (Renewed cheers.) During the 16 years I have had the honour of being returned to Parliament for this division ("You don't represent us I")-mark, I did not say I represented you 1 expressed myself so as not to give offence to any one-but during those 16 years I have endeavoured to lookafteryour interests. (Cheersand cries of "Yoa never do," and " The dockyards I". With regard to the dockyards I say to you what I said to the select committee and whwat I said to the HIouse of Commons, that in that matter I did some things for which I am sorry. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, in the excitement of party feeling, anxious in a partisan spirit to carry an election,Idid wht,Iwill not say no one ever did before me, or willneverdoagan but what I frankly own was more than I ou;htto have done (Great applause.) Gentlemen, I have tred to prove my regret, and that not by barenworda. When Iheardof those calamities, wa Inotright in feelingtbatl ought toplwe myself in presernce of them, if my country wovad become more ready to extend forgiveness to my error when Al found I

So, having done what I could to stone for my sin, you wil
not avoid me; but let it be vour utmost vengeance to tell i me to go and do betterforthefuture. (Laughter .na cheersa.
Gentlemen, I wil not offer any factions opposition to Lordi Palmerston's Government ; I will not jom any one in an, attempt to scramble for office. I Will watch the proceed- I ings of the Government; I will stand by the honour of the lag of England-by her army and her navy. (Cheers.)
LdAI Bmonrxy then presented himself, and was re-
ceived, if not very cordielly by the crowd, at least good-' hunouredly. On the Chinese war question hohadgivenhis vote against the Ministers, because he had carefully eramined all the papers connected with it, and he utterly repudiated, therefore, the notion of his baving coalesced with MIr, Cobden. He begged to assure the electors that, while he would be always ready to reform proved abuses, he would never sanction hasty measures of reform, such as that for the gaanting the county franchise to 101. house. holders. That was a proposal which, in his mind, could only have the effect of swamping the agricultural interest in the House of Commons and destroying the just balance of parties. (Cheers.)
WORCESTERSHIRE (EAST).
The last of the Worcestershire elections took place yester-
day at Droitwich. The two old membars, the lion. Colonel i Bushout and Mr. Hodgetts Foley, offered themselves for i re-election. and were unopsed
Mr. V. Wheeler, the High heeriff, having opened the proceedings,
The Right Hon. Sir J. S. PAXlGTON nou%inated the lHon. Colonel Rushout, and Mr. C. BzARcFopT seconded the nomination.
Mr. T. GALTER proposed, and Mr. FosTMa seconded, the nomination of Mr. J. E. Foley, of Prestwood-house.
No other candidate being proposed Colonel Rushout and Mr. Foley were declared duly elected.
The Hon. Colonel BusouvT thanked the electors for choosing him as their representative for a fourth time, and said, his political views were very well known to them. He had nothing to explain away, and no votes to repent off. The old great questions to which so much importance was formerly attached were now pretty well disposed of-the five points of the charter, the ballot, equal electoral divisiors, large extension of the suffrage, payment of members of Parliaument. Such of these questions as had been brought forward he had voted upon, and he saw no reason to amend those votes. But this was an age of progress. With regard to the conduct of Lord Palmerston, he was aman to whom he conddered the country owed a considerable debt. le had accepted office at a time when the country was drifting into war, and much merit had been ascribed to him-perhaps, more than was really his due-forhaving brought the Russian war to a conclusion; bat still he (Colonel Rushout) was willing to do him justice, and he thought he had shown much firmuness in his conduct since the close of that war. For his part, if he brought forward measures which he (Colonel R-uhout) considered would conduce to the honour and welfare of the country and the maintenance Mf the constitution of England, he would not oppose him. (Hear, hear.) But he would fairly tell them that, if Lord Palmerston were to say, as Lord Melbourne oncea said, "Give me the men who will vote for me when I am in the wrong; I don't want those who will only vote for me when I am right,-I can get plenty of votes then !"-if his hon. colleague (Mr. Foley) were disposed to vote for Lord Palmerston when he was wrong, and he (Colonel Rushont) voted for him when he was right-he would not have much to com. plain of in this election. (Hear, hear.) Colonel Rush. out then declared himsef favourable to economv in the public expenditure, and espeeiaUy advocated a system of selections and promotions to public offices on merit. He attributed the failure of all our early arrangements for the war to the improper mode of saving adopted before the war broke out, and which impaired the whole efficiency of our administrative department. He was for removing the present difficulties which at present clogged the transfer of land, and for an adoption of an uniform system of weights and messures. (Hear, hear.) Sincethe abolition of the corn laws great increase of energy on the part of the farmers had been displayed; he was glad to see they had taken a leaf out of the msanufacturers'book; and what he wanted now to see was a boettereducated cass of servants in husbandry. He was for an extension of education based uponareligiousfoundation, but was not favourable to having it on an exclusive basis, The practicalfact which presentedthegreatest difficulty was the early age at which children were taken from school both in town and country. There was another subject which demanded the immedlite attention of Parliament, i.e., the transportation of criminal offenders. During last winter crime had been rampant, from the flagrant frauds of the Redpaths and Robsons to the more violent and new species of offence more nearly allied to the Thug system than any. thing else-the practice of the.garotte. (Hear, hear.) It was absolutely necessary that some measures should be devised to put a stop to these crimes. He was not prepared to say whether the criminals should be punished at home or transported beyond the seas, but he was inclined to the latter, and, at all events, he thought that whatever was the sentence imposed it should be carried out. (Cheers.)
Mr. FoLnY briefly returned thanks, vindicating the conduct of the Government on the China question. The principles which he had formerly advocated in Parliament were unchanged, and he would still support the principle of free trade and extension of the suffrage.
A vote of thanks to the Sheriff dosed the proceedings.
LEICESTBRSHIRE (NORTH).
The election of two knights for the representation of the northern division of the county of Leicester took place at Loughborough yesterday.
The customary formalities having been gone through, Mr. E. B. HAnTOPP nominated r. E. B. Farnham.
The nomination was seconded by fr. W. P. HEEnsnK.
Sir G. BEAUMoNT nominated the Right Hon. Lord J. Manners, who was seconded by Sir G. PAxaExn
Mr. R. G. COscsswEwL nominated lr. G. iL Frewen.
The nomination was seconded by the Rev. J. B ABNGTO-N. A man named PICKWORTH nominated Mr. R. Cobden. Mr. MoEVBxAY seconded the nomination.
Mr. FARNHAM addremsed the electors, but was not heard beyond the barriers in consequence of the outward naifestations of disapprovaL In avowing his political creed he stated that he was perfectly wiling to accede to the abolition of church-rates, provided some equivalent was given; or otherwise the extinction of the church-rates would be but (an act of spoliation. With regard to education, he desired it to be conducted on the voluntary principle, but for it to be really valuable and beneficial to the community he was convinced that it must be based on religious and moral principles He defended his vote against the Government on the Chinese question, condemned the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston, and contended that he could not consistently vote for the abolition of the income-tax if, at the same time, he supported the aggressive policy of the present Government.
Lord JOHN l.NNssEs was received with maifest signs of disapprobation, and the uproar continued during nearly the whole of Lord John's speech, so that he was but par. tially heard by the populace. With regard to the Chinese question, he said he believed a more honest vote Was neve arrived at by any deliberative assembly in the world. In the course that he had adopted he had nothing to retract, nothing to explain, and nothing to apologize for in reference to that vote, for never was there such a preponderance of argument and citations of authority as on that occasion. Had any Minister ventured to say what would be the termination of this war?1 It would necessarily increase materially the expenditure of the country, and consequently increase the taxation. Lord John Manners then most unequivocally condemned the foreign and domestic policy of Lord Palmerston, and justi.ied the grant to Maynooth on the ground that it was in accordance with the Act of the Union. It had been stated that Lord Palmerston had terminated the war with Russia by securing an honourable and lasting peace, but he wAs not prepared to admit that such was the case, considering that the British Government had abandoned Circassia and the Caucasus to Russia.
Mr. FBRSeV&S afterwards addressed the people, principally aiming to controvert the arguments of Lord John Manners with reference to the Maynooth grant.
A show of hands was taken and was declared to be in favour of Mr. Frewen and Lord Jon Mtanners. A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. I lrnham.
GLOCESTERSHIRE (WEST.)
The election took place at Dursley yesterday. The candidates were Lieutenant-Colonel N. Kingscote, Liberal, and
tr. J. Bolt, Q.C., who came forward in the place of the late member, Ir. R. B. Hale. Up to the last moment no opposition to the election of Mr Bolt was threatened, and
r. Begough the ultra-Liberal candidate at Stroud, went to Duraley to the hustings, and was ready to be put in
nomination had his friends deemed it advisable.i
Lieutenant-Colonel Kingscote was proposed by Mr. T. A. STOUGnTON, and seconrded by Mr. A. Goom.
Colonel BLATE[WAYT proposed Mr. Bolt, wbich was seconded by Sir IL C. BCEV3y.
No other candidate being nominated, the Sheriff declared Colonel Kingsoote and Mr. Bolt duly elected.
Colonel KnGsCoTor thanked the electors for the confidence they had shewn in again electing him. He had always supported Liberal measures, and should oontinue to do so. Referring to his services in the Crimea, he defended Lord Raglan from the calumnies which had been heaped uon him, becawse he could not accomplish impossibilities e contended that the proceedings adopted by Sir John Bow ring were perfectly justifiable, as he was merely resistin
aggressions of the Chinese. He advocated the abolition of church-rates, the adoption of rigid ecenomy in our national expenditure, and protection for the voter when exercisin thie franchise.>
Mtr. BSOLT spoke at great lengh. He professed himself
to be a progres8ive reformer, so far as the application of I the elective privilege to the present requirements of the county was concerned, but he declined to lower the votere qualification, maintaining that the decline in the standard value of money had largely increased the possession of the franchise. He accepted the settlement of our representative system made by the Reform Bill in 1830, and contended that changes in that system should not be proposed every session or even every generation. With respect to the church he was one of its most attached members, and had no ob5ection to such occasional distribu. tions of its revenue as the circumskance of the country required; but he contended thatwe hadno more right to alienate the property of the church than of a prvate individual, and that church-rates should be continued as a means of supporting the fabrics of our churches. He opposed the ballot, contending that if elections were so 8 made the ballot might be adopted in the House of Coinmons. He aIso opposed the auggested levying of rates for
educational purposes, preferring the present system, by: which voluntary efforts wre fostered by State assistance. The income-ta-x, he contended, should be at onoe extin. guished, as it was aar ta, and ihould be levied onlyin times of emergency. He promised his most strenuous asestance in promoting all mesures of legal reform, but condemned the introduction of numerous sl BilLa, which were most mischievous in their effects.

MIDDLESE
The canvass on behalf of the Liberal candidate6, Lord B. Grosvenorand 3r. R. Hsrnbary, jam., is so far completed thattheircommittee consider themselves entitled to speak ofthe resut with the most undoubting confidence. They hav1ecerWinly enjoyed great advantles in the hesitation and delay of the Conservatives in proinding themselveg with E candidate, but the Conservative party have many elements Of strength in Middlesex. From 1837 to 1841 they wera able to return one member, and at the general election in 1852 the MIar o of Blandford polled no less than 4,S58 Totes vasih-tv 3B. Osboine's 4,390. Lord Chelsea, from his family connexion with the county, his political consistency, and the respect in which his private character is held, is considered an unexceptionable candidate by his party; but the late hour at which he appears in the field precludes any;hng like a peraonal canvass of the vast constituency. He has, therefor, an uphill fight to wage, and it will require a great manifestation of zea and. enthusiasm on the part of his friends to snatch a victory from the two Whig candidates. Lord Chelsea addressed a small nun,bor of the electors at Staines yesterday, when a resolutioni,;ag passed in his favour. He will also take as many othwopportunities as possible of explaining bis principlea to .i electors in various parts ofthe county.
Lord B. Grosvenor and.Mr. Hanbury addressed a crowdl& meeting of the electors yesterday eVening at the BU Tavern, EAmonton. Mr. Brker, coachbnllder, s cal to the chair.
Lord E. GROSVENOR first adverted to the BostiLtiesin% Chna. He admitted that the countrydid not concuri opinion with the majority in rhich he voted, but his con victions of the justice of Mr. Cobden's resolution were
withstanding unshalken. Even those who voted with the Government agreed that the dispute might have been arranged without such severe measures as those taken by Sir J. Bowring, and those who voted against Lord Palmerston were of oPinion that the q^uestion ought to have been sent home for further instractions. (" Hear, hear," and hisses.) If he had to give a vote again upon the same question he could not give a different one. ("' Oh, oh ! ") It was not merely a question of shedding innocent blood ; he thought that no diplomatic agent abroad should be permitted to make war without iustructions from home. (Cries of " Oh ! " and disapprobation ) Surely the meeting werenot so enamourad of the war9d. asto wishitback aga. The charge of faction, which had been thrown broadcast against al those who voted against the Government, he, for himself, utterly repudiated and denied, He had placed himself spart in this vote from many of his personal and political friends, and had no object whatever to gain, being
erfectly independent. With regard to the Sunday Tradin ill his motives had been altogether maligned, and the Bill had also been most grossly misrepresented in the public prits. He was pointed out as the poor man's enemy. Now,
e did not wish to boast, but he could oint to scarcely any part of the county of Middlesex where there was an edifice in the erection of which he had not been in some way associated. (Applauae, and a voice,-"1The clubs could have their wine on Sunaday, but the poor man could not have his pint of beer.") His Bill had nothing whatever to do with the sale of beer; it simply aimed at putting down unnecessary Sunday trading, and rather affected the wealthy than the poor. (" Oh ") He wanted every mau to have a day of rest on Sunday, which he might spend in any way he pleasedct (Applause.) ln conjunction with Mr. L. King he brought in that Bill for extending the county franchise. (Applause.) They were beaten upon it in the late Parliament, but he should be happy nevertheless to reintroduce it, and support it in the new Parliament. (Much applause.) The noble lord then adverted to the Bill, which he fought for two sessions and ultimately carried. for having the polls for counties taken in one day. This Bill had effected a great deal of good. He had also voted for Sir W. Clay's Bill for exempting Dissenters from a compulsory church-rate, and he expressed his regret to see such a man out of Parliameut. (Applause.) Offend whom it might, he would certainly vote in the new Parliament for any measure for the abolition of church-rates. (Great applause.) The noble lord concluded by stating that in his political career he had always consideredithe non-electors, and resumed his seat amid loud applause.
hlr. HANBuRy then addressed the electors. With respect to his candidature, he owed it to his noble friend Lord B. Grosvenor. It was feared that the Liberal cause was in jeopardy in Mfiddlesex, and he came forward to stop the gap.
e was not a Liberal for the sake of obtaining their votes, his father and grandfather having transmitted those principles to him. If they returned him to Parliament he should go there as a firm supporter of Lord Palmerston. (Applause.) That noble lord came forward at a great crisis and rescued the country from the deplorable disasters of the late war, and it was not too miuch to say that if Lord Palmerston had come forward earlier many thousands of British lives would have been saved. (Great appleuse.) He was opposed to churchrates, and if a voluntary rate would not be safficient he should vote for total abolition. (Applause.) With respect to education, he did not lke the funds to come entirely from the State, although he would not object to occasional grants for that purpose. Thehon. gentlemanL proceeded todeclarehimself in favour of economy and retrenchment, and said fhat if he went to the House of Commons he should certainly watch very closely every item of the expenditure of the public money. (Cheers.) He was adso favourable to the extension of the franchise, and should vote for Mr. Locke King's measure. (Applause.)
Several luestions havng been ;eut to the candidates and satisfactorily answered a resolution pledging the meeting to use its utmost exertions to return them to Parliament was passed. The proceedings terminated with the u,ual vote of th-a to the chair.
THE RADDINGTON BTJRGHS.
The election of a burg'ess to represent the burghs of Eaddington, Danbar, Norti Berwick, Lauder, and Jedbargh took place at Haddington on Monday, at 1 o'clock. The return of Sir Henry Ferguson Davie, who has represented these burghs for 10 years, was unopposed.
The PROVOST of DuxsJkR (Mr. Comb) moved the re-election of Sir Henry Davis, which was seconded by Mr. DAN;s, Provost of Jedburgh.
io other candidate being proposed, the Sheriff declared the hon. baronet duly elected.
Sir H]SY DAYrE then addressed the electors. He said, -Gentlemen, I come before you now as a thoroughly independent man. I will not pretend to say that I have not party feelings. I have party feeings, and these feelings are all in unison with what I call the true Liberal party of the country. In saying that I am an independent man I will not deny that my sympathies are all with the present Government, with Lord Pamnerston at its head. (Cheers.) I do not mean to say that I will on all occasions support that Government. I think I bave proved the contrary in voting along with hr. Locke Kig, and on mU y other occasions; but I consider that the Government which we now have is a Liberal Government, and the most Liberal Government that, under the circumstances, we can possibly expect to have. We are told by Sir James Graharm that the head of the present Government is nothing but a determined old Tory. lNow, what he is or has been I care no., so long as he brings forward and advocates Liberal measures. So long as he continues the Liberal head of a Liberal Government he shaU have my support; whenever he diverges from that course be shaU equally meet with my opposition. (Cheers.) Sir Henry went on to avow his adhesion to Lord John Russell's programme of peace, economy, and reform, desiring that that peace should be bonourable, that economy wise, and that reform adapted to the avowed [wishes and the admitted wants of the country. (Cheers.)

GLASGOW.
The nomination of two members to represent Glasgow in Parliament took place on Monday at ea hustimgs. which bad been erected in front of the Court-houses, on the Green. The event came off under very uncomfortable circumstances, for rain fell heavily during the whole proceedings.
Si AxRcnni.LD ALisox, the sheriff, having read tba-z. writ'
Mr. H. Druzor, of Craigton, proposed Mr. Alexander Hastie, the late member, which was seconded by Mr. CM GRAY.
The LoRD PROVOSr then proposed 11r.Walter Buchsnan; '* MIr. A. GRAHAM seconded the nomination.
Bailie GALBRAiTH prowosed Mr. IL D,glish, and WaS seconded by Mx. W. W. WATSON.
Mr. HAsThE, who was most coldly received, addressed the electors at some length, but almost entirely confined hlimself to refering to his past Parliamentary career. If the
electors were not satisfied rith that, and with the Parlia-
mientary experience which be had gained in their service,
then they could choose a better man, though he was sure they could find none who had striven to discharge his duty in a more earnest and faithful mauner.
lr. BUCHA.N-t also mnet with a very mixed reception, andreviewed his pst- career and exertions in favour of civil
and religious liberty. He professed himself strongly in favour of education for the people. If that was properly cared for there could be no objection to extended franchise, If returned to Parliament he should support Lord Palmerston on the subject o£ the China war, though be would only
give that Minister an independent support, andnot corsider himself the follower of any Government.
3Mr. DA.LGT sir was received with unbounded applause, He said that under such heavy rain as then fell he would. not detain the electors with any long exposition of his Political principles. He, however, might say that be was in favour of a national systea of education-asystem under the control of the ratepayers, divested of cerubrous and expensive machinery. He bad much respect for the voluntary system, but he doubted if its benefits would reach all the children of large towns such as Glasgow. If they returned him to Parliament and he found the Minister truckling to despotic Powers, or meddling by intervention with other States, that Minister he would oppose. He would support Lord Palmerston as long as his policy was conducted with a view to the trae interests of tbe country but he would not support him if he was dispoed to offer any opposition to a liberal mee of reform. He did believe, however, that after this appeal to the country, and when his lordship foDhad himself- be would be-so gna honoured, that a large and liberal scheme of reform would be intreduced.

I seba ha e nough of them presently. (Alaugh.j I would fain revert to the topics with which I commenced, and express an earnest hope that those misunderstandings which have existed among our fr.ends may cease with a contest that we never wished should have had this complexon. Far better-ten thousand times better, that both. parties should have been arrayed together, tbree against three, and have manftlly fought itout betweenithem, than that there should have been what has caused me inexpressible pain, and has been the bitterest in gredient of all-I mean 'the appearance of our standing in hostility to a former colleague. I trust thav-in all future pub3ic meetings of ourfriends and our party as many farmers as possibly mad be invited to attend; and that if it should happen again, as it often must, that a public meett ingmustdelegateits powerstosomecomiitteeofitsownbody to examine considerations affecting the interests of electors or of candidates, the farmerswill do uS the honour to act on such committee. (Hear.) Whateverelse may occUrat future elections, I hope at least that circumstances as painful zs the present will not again arise; and I most earnestly trust that there may never be another election in which the cultivators of the soii, who must always form the pride and boast of the Conservative party, shall have any reason to suppose that their opinions and wishes are not sufficiently consulted, or their importance adequately estimated. But, turning from politics, let me recall to your minds what is much more eloquent than any poor words of minand what will much more fordbly convince you of our desire to maintain goodwill towards our friends and good faith with our opponents-I mean the image of that noble son of a noblefatherwho, though no longer a candidate at tese hustings, is still the representative of our honour, and the true hero of the day. (LJoud cheers.)
Mfr. C. W. Purs., the new member, nexct returned thank3 for the honour that had been done him, and entered into a somewhat lengthened exposition of his political sentiments. He warmly defended the conduct of the Government on the Chinese question, and maintained that Sir J. Bowring and Sir IN Seymour had been cruelly and anjustly treated by their assailants in Parliament. The nmperor of China, he said, was more reasonable than his commissioner; and the orders recently issued by that potentate were a triumphant vindication of the conduct of our authorities at Canton. He did not exult in, but sincerely regretted, the rejection of such eminent men as Messrs. Cobden and Bright; but the question of questions now before the country was whom would it have for Prime Minister-Lord Palmerston (loud cheers), or Lord Derby. (Derisive laughter.) Tothat appeal hewasgladto say the constituencies were giving an almost unanimous response. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston had been acoused of having no policy by the hon. baronet (Sir B. B. Lytton), who was a member of a party which, with the assistance of the scraps and fragments of every other disjointed comb'nation, had Ialways laim in wait for an opportunity to put the Government in a minority. ("Hear," and a laugh.) Seeing the recent state of parties it was not to be supposed that the Premier would have courted defeat by introducing measures that were sure to be thwarted by a factious opposition. Lord Palmerston's foreign policy was called turbulent and aggressive, but that pohey had maintained a long European peace until it was broken under the rule of the Aberdeen Cabinet, and before that Cabinet had been six months in power. Lord Palmerston had, it was true, been a Conservative in his youth, bnt he had learnt wisdom in his maturer years; whereas, Lord Derby, who began his career as a Iaberal, had gone backward as he grew older, and wras now the greatest obstrucEon to legislative amelioration. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman then expressed himself favourable to a considerable extension of the county franchise; avowed himself adverse to the withdrawal of the Maynooth grant, now that its continuance rested upon a compact; and ended by declaring that he should support a mcdifeation, but not a total repeal of church-rates.
On the motion of Sir H. MEtU, seconded by Sir E. B. LYrToN, a vote of thanks was passed to the fligh-Sheriff, and the concourse then dispersed.
Flags were displayed from many of the houses in Hertford, and the townspeople observed the day as a general holyday. The whole of the proceedings passed off with remarkable order and decorum.
NORTECAMTONSBIRE (SOUTH).
(FRorM OUR OWN RLPOToER).
The nomination of two knights of the shire to serve in Parliament for the southern division of the county of Northampton took place yesterday at Northampton. The candidates nominated were Colonel Howard Vyse and Mr. Enightley, the old members, and Lord Althorp, the eldest son of the present and nephew of the late Earl Spencer, who made his first appearance before the constituency. The contest promises to be very close and exdting, and from the extensive preparations which are being made on both sides there is no doubt that it wil take a prominent place in the electioneering annals of the county. The struggle, it is said, will be between Lord Althorp and Colonel Vyse, as Mr. Knightley's seat is thought to be perfectly secure. This division of the county has been represented by Conservatives for many years, but it is confidently expected by the Liberals that the series will be broken on this occasion, and that Lord Althorp wiU be returned at the head of the toll. The proceedings excited great interest; and, notwithstanding the heavy rain which fell in the early part of the morning, the market-plwae was filled by a dense crowd, whose sympathies appeared to he entirely in favour of the Liberal candidate. Lord A.Ltherp was escorted into the town by a mounted cavalcade of about 600 of his friends and supporters, and he was louely cheered as he passed along bv the crowd which thronged the streets.
A fter the reading of the writ, and the n sual formalities,
The THIG $nUFFvw (Mr. W. Mackworth Dolben) having bespoken a fair hearing for all parties,
Sir HmEuv L;R DstvDElD nominated Colonel Howard Vyse as a fit and proper person to represent that division of the county. The majority by which he had been returned on a former occasion showed that the electors were satisfied with his conduct and he hoped that majority would be repeated on thepresent occasien, notwithstanding that his opponent was a sprig of the aristocracy-no less a person than the heir of the powerful house of Spencer. (" Hurrah for Althorp !") Colonel Vyse had now represented them for 10 years His opinion,s were the same now as before, and his determination to uphold the institutions of the country remained unaltered. Colonel Vyse had not that magic prefix to his name wvhich seemed to have such an effect with some of the electors, but, for himself, he would rather be reDresented by a plain colonel than misrepresented by a lord, even though he might live in a palace at Althorp. He hoped the result of the struggle would show that the electors of South Northamptonshire were not to be bought over w/ith money nor seduced by rank. (Groans.)
Mr. A . C.anvwnlro seconded the nomination. Colonel Vyse had come forward at a time of great difficulty, when the agricultural interest was in a state of great pnic and alaxm. Hehadserved the electors well, and theyought not to desert him now. He had no fear of the result if the electors were left to themselves, but he knew for a fact that intimidation and undue influence had been used to a great extent. (" Name, name.') Pressure had been put upon the electors by all sorts of persons, from the wife of the noble Premier down to a well-known land surveyor. (Groans.) When the noble lord first came forward he thought they were going to have a fair fight of it, but what had ocourredal yshowed that his anticipation would be disappointed.
The Hon. F. ViLELs proposed Mr. Rainald Knightley, who, he said, had satisfactorily fulfilled all the pledges which had been given for him when chosen for the first time at the last election. He was a man who would take his own line and keep it, and who would set aside all private feelings and interests if they stood in the way of the maintenance of those great Conservative principles in support of which he had been returned.
Mr. W. SMYTH seconded the nomination.
Mr. C. C. ELWES proposed Lord A lthorp, a young nobleman well known in the county, whose uncle had served rhe county well for many years, and who, he could answer for it, would always be found to be the firm friend of the tenant farmer and of the poor man. He was a true Liberal, and it was to his liberal principles that he trusted for victory. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. H. NETHERCOTE seconded the nomination. He had known Lord Althorp since he was a child, and he would undertake to say that he would never disgrace the name he bore. (Cheers-) He might be young, but some of the most eminent statesmen which this country had ever produced bad commenced their Parliamentary career at an earlier age. If they returned Lord Althorp, they would retnra no absentee, but one who would be a constant resident among them, and who would take an interest in their local matters. (Cheers.)
Colonel VYsx, whosa reception was not very flattering. for the groans of his opponents completely drowned the feeble cheer raised by his saprozters, then addressed the electors. He said that the few remarks which he had to make would be addressed to those wno had votes for the county, though he appealed to all present, whether electors or non-electors. to secure him a fair hearing. He was glad at last to have met his noble oppo-
nent face to face, and, though he had nO wish to say anyting which should hurt the feelings of the noble lord or his friends, he must complain that he had not been
very fairly treated by the noble lord's backers. It would be difficult for him to find fault with the noble lord's principles, for he knew not what thev were. (" More shame for you, stupid.") In his address the noble lord said he came forward on his uncle's principles, but in a speech delivered since issuing that address he was reported-he knew not how truly-to have said that he did not profess any decided principles, and that if returned he should go to Parliament to mature his principles, and not to act upon any which he had already matured. The noble lord had declared that he should support Lord Palmerston's Government on his uncle's principles, but he would find that his uncle was a far more advanced Liberal than there was any chance of Lord Palmerston becoming.
(Groans.) If the noble lord was a real Liberal the oper Prine Minister for him was Lord John Russe not Lord Palmerston. ("Palmerston for ever.") :e had no fault to find with the noble lord on account of his youth; thatwasarmisfortune which he envied him. Time was when he himself was the junior candidate, but now, unfortunately, he was the senior. Surely they vwould not now turn their backs on him unless they could point out a satisfactory rerson. It was urged against him that when he first came forward he was a pressed man, and not a volunteer, bat surely that was nO valid ground of complaint if they could find no one else to come forward and undertake their representation at a difficult crisis. If that were their fairness he blushed for the constituency. ("Oh! yon shamefaced
colonel !") If he had done anything to deserve their censure he hoped they would come forward manfully and state in what he had offended; but it wouid not be fair
dischar him without a reason. He had acted up l the professions which he had made when they sent him to Parliament, and, though he might have committed errors, he had done bis hest to discharge his duty to them. He trusted himseli in the hands of the electors, and he hoped they would not desert him

BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.
(FROM OUR OWN REPORTEMS.)
The nomination of three representatives for the coounty of Buckingham took place yesterday in the County-hall, Aylesbury. As it was well understood beforehand that there would be no opposition to the return of the three former members, Mr. Disraelil Mr. DP Pre, and Mr. Cavun. dish, there was on this occasion an absence of aU that excitement whioh generally accompanies a contested election, but, nevertheless, a considerable number of persons from the surrounding districts flocked into Aylesbury, anxious to 'witness the proceedings of the nomination and hear the address of the great chief of the late Parliamentary Opposition. Among those assembled in the haU were Mr. P. D. P. Duncombe, Colouel Hanmer, Ur. Acton Tindal, Sir H. Verney, ILP., Mr. C. Tower, Dr. Lee, Mr. W. Lowndes, Hon. W. G. Cavendish, hMr. T. T. Bernard, M.P., Mr. R. B. Harvey, lIdr. J. Newman, Mr. W. L. Ward, under-sheriff.
The business of the election was opened very punctually at 10 o'clock, and the requisite legal preliminaries having ibeen gone through,
lr. l'. DUNcoisIsB proposed Mr. Caledon George DuPre who, he said, had represented the county for 18 years, and whose consistent and independent conduct entitled him to a renewal of the confidence of the electors. (Applause.)
Mr. R. B. HARVEY seconded the nomination.
Sir HI. VEnsxEY proposed blr. Charles Compton Caveudish, and the nomination was seconded by Mr. C. TowEa.
Colonel HA.N3[ER proposed Mr. Benjamin Disraeli (cheers and a few hisses), observing that the high attainments and great qualifications of the right hon. gentleman had raised num to the high honour of sitting at the councils of his Sovereig5n
Mr. J. NiEvAN seconded the nominiation. As no other candidate was proposed,
The H TcrI S1hERIFF declared, amid general applause, that the choice of the electors had fallen on Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Du l're, and Mr. Cavendish.
lr. DUPRE expressed his acknowledgments for his reelection, and said he hoped that none of his votes-not even the last vote he had given-were deserving the censure of his constituents. (Cheers, and slight disapprobation.) He could not conceal from his constituents that he did not find himself a member of an united Opposition. Various causes had produced strife and schism in their ranks, which time might repair, but tbeir principles were unchanged and unchangeable. For his own part, he would strenuously resist al hasty and ill considered changes in the constitution. Many of his friends appeared somewhat dazzled by the popularity of the luinibter who now guided the helm of the State, and some of them seemed impatient to offer bim allepiance and to proclaim themselves his devoted followers; gut the policy of that noble lord was too uncertain and indefinite, and the composition of his Government was too unsatisfactory, to justify him (Mr. Dupre) in pledging any uniform or coruial support to the noble lord. At the same time he would offer no factious opposition to Lord Palmerston, but would give all the measures of his Government full and fair consideration. That noble lord had many claims upon thegratitude of the country. Hehad eortainly accepted the reins of Government at a time when it was difficult to find a person to undertake the duty; and, aided by the intrepidity of the British army, and the enthusiastic feelinig of the people, he had carried the country through a glorious warto a successfulpeace. (Cheers.) He aLso honoured the noble lord for enforoing the conditions of the treaty, for when our late enemy was disposed to evade its termsr, and when our most powerful ally showed no alacrity to enforce them, the noble lord, as it was said of Pitt,
Stood to his coustby's honour fost.
And nal'd his ooloura to the ma8t.`
(Cheers.) They were in complete darkness as to what would be the policy of the Government in the new Parliament. He did not know whether that policy ,would be Conservative or otherwise, but he sincerely trusted that the measures of reform in their institutions -shich were required by the country would notbepostponed by perpetual cries for Parliamentary reform. He was anxious that provision should be made for the extension of education, and to see reforms effected in the law, an alteration in the law of settlement, a reform of the military establishments, and more salutary regulations adopted with regard to beerhouses. He also thought the Legislature ought to take such measures as would secure the abolition of the income-tax at leastin 1860. (Cheers.)
Mlr. CAVENDISHI briefly returned thanks, and declared his continued adherence to those Liberal principles which he professed when he became the representative of the county 10 years ago. In answer to a question, he declined to support the ballot.
Mr. DISRAELI then came forward, and was greeted with loud cheers, on the subsidence of which " One cheer more" was demanded, and heartily rendered. He said :-Gentlemen, -I beg to return you my thanks for the great honour you have done me in returning me for the fourth time to Parliament as your representative, You know how much I appreeiate that honour. I think it the greatest which I shaLl probably ever be able to possess. I do not pretend for a mhoment that I deserve it, but I assure you I will, as heretofore, endeavour to merit it. (Applause.) I cannot pretend to d:sguise that I am also very much satisfied with 'he very goodhumoured and calin manner in which the proceedings of this day have been conducted. You have sent'me to Parliament with two colleagues whom, political considera. tions apart-and we need not always dweU on them-I find extremely satisfactory; and whether it be Mr. Dupr6 or M r. Cavendish, whenever the interests of Buckinghamshire are concerned, I find in them invariably the same sympathy and support; and though I cannot pretend to conceal that in this as in every other instance I sbould be very happy to see members returned who agree with me in political opinions, yet I can tell you that it is a very great satisfaction to have to deal with colleagues between whom aud yourselves there is great mutual confidence and reliance, which never fails you whenever the affairs of the place which they repregvent come into question in the House of Commons. (Cheers.) I know that on occasions like the present you expect from your members some account of their stewardship. I do not wish at aU to evade that subject. A law was passed which much changed the manner in whicheloctionsusedtobe carried on in this country. I know that some are dissatisfied with that change; but I am not. Instead of the noise and nonsense which charaeterized former days it is better that between electors and elected there should be opportunities of frank communications. (Cheers.) Isee before me many men on both sides perfectly competent to form an opinion on p ublic affairs,-who read the journals of the day, and tbiLk over what they read; and I think they have a right to expect from me on an occasion like the present that I should communicate with them without reserve, and that, instead of taking refuge, as in old days candidates were too mtuch accustomed to do, in some claptrap of the moment, I should address you with the same seriousness as if I were addessing the House of Commons. (Applause.) It is in that spint that I shall make a few observations this day. I cannot suppose that every one in this ha3l will agree with me-for there are two Rryat parties in tire country represented here-while I advert to the past, and in some degree to the future; but, as I hope I shall speak with temper and say nothing I do not believe to be true, I ami sure I shal receive forbearance and a fair hearing ori all sides. (Applause.) I have to givo you an account of my stewardship, and also to hold out to you the course vhich I shaU probably feel it to be my duty to pursue hereafter. (Hear.) When I last had the honour of addressing you I was in the responsible position of a Minister of the Crown, and I think I told you that, if returned to Parliament, I would endeavour to introduce, with r)y colleagues, measures which, in my opinion, would be for the advantage of the community-measures which I considered would bring_ the Rreatest happiness to the greatest unumber. ('- That's rght.") I am not conscious that I did not endeavour to fulfil that pledge. Now that the heat of party is past I may advert to what I attempted to do in fulfilment of that pledge. (Hear, hear.) The Government, at the head of which was the Earl of Derby (we may be permitted to allude to a subject which at the time it was impossible to treat with the frankness we are now at liberty to do) -the Government of the Earl of Derby acceded to office when the position of the country was of a much n,ore critical nature than was generally supposed at the tinue. Our relations with the Republic of Franoe were of a chsracter to be described even as menacing, and at the same tine there was a feeling in England that the defences of
the country were in a inost unsatisfactory condition; and we bad, therefore, to endeavour to get our relations with one who afterwards became our great and muchcberished ally inasatisfactorystate, and yet atth same time to mnrake the people of this country feel assured that Enxgland was no longer in that neglected state with respect to her defences which it is now universally acknowledged thbt she then wws. Gentlemen will reco1lect that we aie
into office on this issue-whether it were possible or not to raise the great militia force of this country on the voluntary pTinciple. The Whig Government were of opinion that that was totaUl iimpossible, and sooner than attempt it they relinquished offic. We were of a different opinion, and I
appesl to you whetber the result did not prove that our
oinion was the correct one. (Cheers.) N ever was anytingn more successful than the Militia Act, by wbich we rsised a force distinguished by efficiency and patriotism at jcost not exceeding one-fourth of a million per annum. That was our first measure. (Great applause.) We found tire defences of the country, our naval as well as the lint foxces, in an unsatisfactory state, and Eng land was ' alarmed lest she should be invaded. We
had no Channel fleet; when Lord Derby's First Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Nortbumberland, created that feat flet of screw men-of-war which, in 1S8i3, was a speetacle of which every Englishmau was proud. We found tbe Ordance of the country in a state almost impossible to be credited at the preeent moment, though history may describe it. (Hear, hear.) When we acceded to office
there were not 50 field-pieces in the country fit for use. It is a remarkable fact, but true, that at the funeral of the Dake of Wellington-it beiDg customasy that when a FieldXarshal is buried with public militry honours 17 field-pieceas hould attend Iss funeral-not 17-gun-carriages
wrere to be found in the coubtry adeqluate Sor the purpose. WSnaio gSlL, we left the~ Ordnance with 2b00iieldpeo, the A lery corps in -the most exellent coudition. (Cheers} These wer our measures for ;he defence of the country; but so successful were our
negotiations with the Republio of France that these prepanr
tions, made in some anticipation or fear of an invasion from France, served to strengthen and protect us in the war which afterwards ensued with Russia, when France became our efficient ally. (Great applause.) et me, aLqo, very briefly tell you what took place with respect to France. When we came into office the utmost jealousy existed because the refugees from every nation of the world, stirred up by the revolutions of 1848, 'were in our inviolate island, ever safe and free. We had demands made on us by the head of the French Rlepubhc, and also by the Emperor of Austria, to deliver up those refugees who were political criminalsin their own country, many of them being danger. our characters. Butdid wedeliverthem up? On the contrary, wesaidthat, so longas theyremainedinthis countryand acted in deference to the laws, 'we would protect them. (Loud cheers.) Not only this, but Switzerland, which at that time was also a country to which these political refugees had fled, was tbreatened by France: and it was by the mediation of this country that we preserzed those refugees from being given up to the countries they had quitted, and preserved the indepondence of Switzerland. (Cheers.) About this time a mostimaportant event ocourred in Europe. Before we acceded to office the coutp d'gt#t took place in France. It was perfectly clear that the head of the French Republic inteDded to revive the Empire, and every great Power which signed the Treaty of Vienna objected to that revival, because they were bound by that treaty not to recognize the Napoleon dynasty. I say, then, we had that critical question brought before us, and we decided that the Napoleon dynasty should be recognized. We decided Bo at a time when the Napoleon dynasty 'was most unpopular in this country, and 'we refused to listen to the suggestions of Austria and Russia. We would not postpone or procrastfnate, and we recognized Napoleon lIE. (Rear, hear.) It is that speedy and cordial recognition by England of the present Emperor of the French that clinched the French alliance and transformed that great man and ruler, who entertained unfriendly feelings towards this country, into the cordial and sincere ally he has since shown himself to be. (Applause.) We were very much attacked for the course we then took. We were described as truckling to France; but allow me to tell you that we did not take that course until we had previously obtained a declaration from the present Emperor of the French that he would recognize al his predecessors of anl dynasties, and all their public acts, since 1815. (Cheers.) Therefore we were careful of the interests of Europe, while at the same time we pursued a policy which prepared for us that powerful alliance which in the impending struggle proved of so much advantage. (Cheers.) Youwilexcuse mefor advertingto theseimportant facts, because it wasatthis place thatI made mypledges asto the course I should pursue; and it is not for ostentation, but for the purpose of showing the fulfilment of the pledges I made, that I enter into these important explanations. (Applause.) At the same time I told you, when legal reforms were much mentioned, that 'we were determined to carry all those legal reforxms of the necessity of which we were perfectly sensible. Aid did we not redeem our pledge ? The very first thing we did 'was to effect a complete reformation of the Court of Cbancery. Three bills were brought in by Lord St. Leonard's of a most efficient and stringent. nature. We put an end to reference to the offices of the Masters in Ohancery, which had been described as sinks of iniquity. We demolished and swept all those offices away by the Chancery Procedure Act, and we gave you a procedure in equity as efficient, expeditious, and inexpensive as any in common law. (Hear, hear.) That was a great reform-the greatest legal reform ever effected in this country. (Applause.) We also prepared a bill, and gave noticeof it, for a comi.ete reform of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and it was not our fault that we did not introduce it to Parliament. (Eiear, hear.) Permit me also to say with respect to the foreign politics of this country that there are many subjects 1 might dwell on as coming under our hands during the eventful year when we held the reins of power. There were two questions on which I claim the best reward whioh a public man in England can possess-namely, the approbation and respect of his constituents. We have had a great deal of excitement with respect to the 'war with Persia. It is a subject of great controversy whether the Government of this country ought to have engaged in that war without assembling and appealing to Parliament, and whether the course pursued by the present Administration has been a just one; but I will not now enter into that question. It is generally thought that if the city of Herat is in the possension of Persia our Indian dominion is in danger. I may mention the general opinion without entering into the controversy. Now, recently, that city having been captured by Persia, war was proclaimed, or rather undertaken, against Persia, without tho knowledge of Parliament. Very conside-able expenses have been incurred, and though we are told that peace has been effected, it will always be a guestion 'whether the course pursued in respect to Persia has been just and politic. Let me remind you that when the Government of Lord Derby was in office the very same circumstance occurred with respect to Persia as at the present day. The Shah of Persia not only menaced, but besieged, attacked, and captured the city of Hferat. According to the political doctrines of this day our Indian Empire was in danger. What was the course 'we took? DidweinvadePersiaandmake'warwithout the cognizance of Parliament? (Hear.) Did we involve this country in immense expenditure? Verv different was the course we pursued. We had an efficirent representative at the Court of Teheran-Colonel Sheil. He was not a person of our own political opinions, but I am bound to say that he was an efficient man. We sent to him the most energetic but conciliatory instructions. We told him to go to the Shah of Persia, and impress upon him that if he persisted in the course he was pursuing we would adopt measures of earnest stringenoy. We regluired him to give up Herat, and to return to his own domimons, or we would invade his country, and take measures which would render a repstition of his offence impossible. Whatdid the Shah do? He retired from Herat, and conceded all 'we required, without our incurig those great expenses which have now been incurred in respect to the Persian expedition, and without our entering into a course which I doubt whether the spirit of the constitution would justify. We succeeded in effecting all the present Government had done without turmoil and expense. (Applause.) I say tlis in justice to a colleague of mine, who, because our Government unfortunately did not possess a majority in Parliament, was at the time made the object of ridicule and abuse-I meautbe Barlof Malmesbury. He was, however, one of the most liberal and efficient Secretaries of State this country ever had, and he it was who oarried on the negotiation I have alluded to with Persia. (Applause.) Another great act, which I am bound to bring under your notice, has reference to a mission we sent to South America to open the great rivers-the Paraguay and the Paranawhich were never before open to our commercial enterprise. That mission completely effected its purpose, and those great rivers were opened to our merchants, and great benefits have already accrued, and ncomparable advantages will still accrue therefrom to the commerce of this country. (Cheers.) Having touched on the Foreign Department as conducted in those days, and on the legal reforms 'we effected, permit me now to say that in our colonial affairs there was at that time one most critical emergency arisingout of the gold discoveries in Australia. All the refuse population of the world immediately poured into our colonies, and by the law as It then stood every ounce of gold discovered became the property of the Queen of England. Here 'were the seeds of discontent, difficulty, and disaffection. (Hear.) Yet, by a bill we introduced for regulating the casual revenues of Eer M ajesty, and by he desvatches of Sir J. Pakington, all that disturbance was settled. The prinoiples on which this new development of wealth should be regulated were admirably established, and the prosperity of those colonies is at present a subject of pride and congratulation to every Englishman. (Cheers.) I have touched on those measures which we passed, and there were some we proposed for 'which I myself, as the organ of the Government, was responsible, but which 'we unfortunately did not pass,-the financial measures of the Government. (A cry of " The Commons turned you out.") No, they did not turn me out, and they did notwish me to go out; but Isaid then as I saynow, that I never wil submit to be a Minister on sufferance. (Loud cheers.) I am prepared to say that all those measures were measures conceived for the advantage of the community and the multitude; and the excellence of those measures cau be proved by the simple test that they have been either passed by our successors, or are demanded by the public voice. (Applause.) We proposed a great change-the reduction of the tea duties. Was there ever a rmeasure brought forward more calculated to increase the happiness and comfort of the people, and at the same time to stimulate industry? Well, our successors aceepted that measure and carried it into effect. (Applause.) fheze was also the measure to bring into the Exchequer the gross instead of the net revenue of the country. Before that period there was a sum of 5,000,0001. or 6,000,0001. which really never came under the control of the representatives of the people, and the measure to alter this arrangement has been passed. (Cheers.) Another great measure we proposed was that in the regulation of the income-tax there should be made a difference between preoarious and permanent incomes. (Cheers.) I ask you now, what subject is there which at the present time excites more interest, and whether there is not a great demand by the public voice for such a distinction to be established ? (Great applause.) I tell you further, I think that perhaps it is impossible satisfactorily to establish a difference of that kind; therefore I am for getting rid of the income-tax with all its odious inequalities. (Cheers.) With your indulgence I have endeavoured to give you some account of my stewardship when I was a member of the Government, and in doing so I am not aware that I bavetaken an unusual course, orone whichit was notimydutyto pursue. (Applause.) I have nowv to give you an account of what I have done as
your representative since I have been a member of the Opposition, and, through the indulgence of my friends, have been intrusted with a considerable part in the mp,nagement of their affairs. After the fall of the Government of Lord Derby the most important event that has occurred since I was last elected as a member for Buckinghamshire was, no doubt, the 'war with Russia. Now, what was the conduct of the Opposition when that war commenced ? I am bold to say that they pursued such a course as was never before taken by,pny Opposition. (Cheers.) We called our friends together, 'we said the country was in great danger; that it was involved in a struggle with a continental Power of colossal military resources; and that the occasion was not one on which common Parliamentary controversies should be encouraged. We said there must be no struggle for political power while the country was in such a position, but that we must show foreigners that, however we may oiticize each other's conduct with reapect to domestic affairs, when the Fafety of the empire is threatened we are all united. (Cheers.) We said that we must support the Government cordially and completely in the prosecution of a war which 'we beheved to be most necessay and politic, and that we must not only afford them sunport y voting men and money, but by refraining during the progress of the warthough it should last four years-from introducing any mnotion which might enfeeble theAdministration or endanger its existeace. (Cheers.) This is not merely my own view of the conduct of the Opposition, but Lord Palmerston hae, to his honour, done justice more than once in the House of Commons, and very recently on the hustings before his own constituents, to the patriotic conduct of tho Opposition during the war. (Cheers.) But has that always been the eonduct of the Opposition? Did the Opposition pursue such a course durnng the great wea with France On the oontrary, the Govegnment of thatWday were harassed aud asa iled on every opportunity; the talents of our mlli-
tary leaders-even of the Duke of Wellington himselfwere decried and depreciated; and no hope was ever held out to England that the termination of that struggle would be successful and glorious. Now, acting in a different spirit, we did what we could to support Her Majestys Government. (Hear, hear.) We have opposed no measures which they brought forward with the view of placing great resources at their disposal. The only oourse we took was to stimulate their exertions, and the only objections we ever urged were objections to the inefficient mode in which the resources placed at their disposal were applied. (Cheers.) (A voice-'You knew the people were with them.") I should bey sorry to find that the oeople of this country were not it heir Government ihen the nation was involved in a severe struggle with a gTeat military Power. 5Cheers.) I never thought of that ; f took it for granted. Renewed cheers.) Now, gentlemen, let me make a lew remarlks as to the course which we pursued when the Government of Lord Aberdeen was broken up and Lord Palmerston took the reins of office. It is very possible I may say things which will not be pleasing to many admirers and fo owers of Lord Palmeraton, but I wiU say nothin here that I would not say in his presence. (" Bravo" anc cheers.) Lord Pslmerston is a very good-tempered man, and I ho- his admirers will be equally good-tempered. (Laughte I cheers.) I advert to the facts I am about to mention, .ot with the view of attacking Lord Palmerston, but in order to explain and illustrate the conduct of the Opposition, for whioh I am in a considerable degree responsible. It is said that Lord Palmerston took the reins of Government and carried on the war with very great effloienoy. Allow me to mention this fact-that the instant he took the reins of Government he commenced negotiations for an ignominious peace. (Cheers and some expressions of dissent.) I am now stating faots, and I am quite sure it is your desire, as it is yonr interest, to have accurate and precise ideas upon all these subjeots. Lord Palmerston sent Lord J. Russel to Vienna with instructions to negotiate peace. I have heard, and I believe, that those instructions whioh Lord J. Russell received to guide his conduct at Vienna were drawn up by Lord Palmerston's owu hand. Indeed, I think it highly improbable that the most experienced statesman of this country in the management of foreign affairs would refrain at so critical an emergency from performing such a duty. Well, it so happened that, although these proceedings were very secret, some communications were made to me of the terms upon which peace was about to be negotiated (hear), and they appearedto me to be terms which would' prove most unsatisfactory to the people of England and mostinjurious to the interests and honour of the country. My information, although accurate, was not complete, and I was in such a position that I could not make so frank a use of it as I can do at the present day. I brought forward a motion in the House of Commons-on the eve, I think, of the Whitsaun holydays-asking tho House on the statement I made to resolve that the ambiguous language and unicertain conduct of our plenipotentiary aT Vienna were sources of great distrust and anxiety to Parliament. That was as much as I could do, but it was su^fficient to warn the House as to the state of affairs, and to check the Government. The resolution which I brought forward, on the evc, I think, of the Whitsun holg'days, was defeated by a large majority-a majority of 10u; and it wvas defeated because Lord J. Russell had at that time returned from Vienna and made a most warlike speech, in which he appealed to the spirit of the House and the country. He was supported by the Prime Linister with so much -apparent sympathy and cordiality that the House could not believe the impression I wished to convey wasjustifiable, and a majority was in favour of the Government. Now, it so happened that the French plenipotentiary, who worked with Lord J. Russell at Vienna, and who had counseUed those terms which I considered ignominious, was very much annoyed that the negotiations failed, and that his own Government had not supported him as they promised to do, and as according to his instructions they were bound to do. He was no less distinguished an individual than D. Drouyn de Lhuys, a Secretary of State for France, and who had been Ambassador in England. He resigned his office, and not only did he do that, but he revealed in his own vindication all that had occurred. It happened, therefore, when Parliament met again after the holydays that theee transactions were matters of notoriety, and several of the most distinguished members who had spoken and voted against my motion-some privately, and others publicly in their places in Parliament -expressed deep regret for the course they had adopted. In consequence I asked a friend of mine, a very distin6uished member of the House of Commons, the representative of a neighbouring county, who I hope will be a member of the next Parliment--Sir BulwerLytton-to bring before the House the whole subject of the Vienna negotiations. He gave notice of a motion with that object, andwhat was the consequence? The existence of the Government was at stake. An indignant House of Commons would have terminated the existence of the Palmerston Cabinet as it terminated the existence of Lord Aberdeen's
Cabinet, and the Government were only saved by Lord J. I Russell coming forward and making himself their volua. tarv scapegoat. I am bound to say that Lord Palmerston offered to statd or fall by Lord J. Russell; but, as the majority against Lord Palmerston's Government would have been overwhebming, Lord J. Russell himself offered to be the scapegoat, and I must say in justice to that noble lord, who has incurred so much unpopularity, that I think such unpopularity undeserved, because although the terms of peace contemplated were, in my opinion, unsatisfactory and ignomiious, Lord J. RusseU as an individual was not responsible for those terms, but the responsibilty rested upon the Cabinet which he represented, and upon the Prime Minister of that Cabinet. (Hear, hear.) It is necessary that sound ideas should prevail as to the conduct of public men, and it appears to me necessary to enter into these details in order that you may not suppose that I deviated from what I maintain was the patriotic course of the Opposition in supporting the Government in their conduct of the war by counseUing that the resolution to which I have referred should be brought forward. I say, then, when we are told of the energetic manner in which the war was carried on, that something is due to the Parliamentary Opposition of England during both the Governmentsof Lord Aberdeen and of Lord Palmerston. (Cheers.) At last we had peace. My hon. colleague has given great credit to Lord .Palmerston for the manner in which he insisted that the terms on which peace was negotiated should be carried out in their true spirit. I have also given Lord Palmerston credit in the House of Commons for that conduct; but allow me to tell you that there never would have been a question about the terms of peace if our negociator at Paris had not committed one of the greatest blunders probably recorded in the history of diplo. maey, for he agreed to a treaty of peace in which the principal object for which we went to war-namely, the freedom oE the Danube-was entirely omitted. What Lord Palmerston, therefore, deserves every credit for is this, that, having discovered that we had made a very great blunder, and that the country was deprived of the very object for which such great sacrifices of blood and treasdre had been made, he determined, like a true Englishman, not to shrink from his demand, but to fight out of the blunder, feeling sure the country would back him - and at last we got what we might have obtained vithout al this bluster and disturbance. In caTrying you through these details I feel that I am only doing my duty. We meet very rarely, and you naturally wish that those whom you send to the House of Commons, and especially those who, from circumstances, take an active part in public affairs, should, when they maeet yoa on such occasions as the present, communicate with you without reserve. (Cheers.) I have now given you an account of my stewardship as one of the hinisters of the Crown, and as one of your representatives during the great war in which this country has recently been engaged. Allow me next to inform you what, when peace was at last accomplished, I considered to be my duty to the country, and more especially to you. I suppose, gentlemen, you must all be aware from sad experience that the taxes of this country have necessarily been greatly increased during the late struggle. You must all be painfully conscious that the burdens upon your industry and your property have been greatly augmented of late years, and it appears to me that, peace having been concluded, the duty of the House of Commons was calmly to survey the financial condition of the country, and to consider by what prudent and proper means we couldaUeviate the burdens of the people and obtain what are the great blessings of peace-lighter taxation and a freer course for capital and industry. (Cheers.) Well, gentlemen, it was with that object that I have expressed, and that my friends have expressed, our opinion that considerable reduction should be effected in the ipublic expenditure. The present Government claims very great credit for taking off the income-tax what is called "the war ninepence," which might have been continued for another year. I am gratified, gentlemen, that you are relieved from that" war ninepence," but I am not perfectly sure if a certain notice had not been given in the House of Commons on the first night of the last session that you would have got rid of that taxation. (A laugh and cheers.) All I know is that the estimates of this coantry-as I have tbe highest authority for stating-were reduced I believe within 48 hours by the amount of 3,000,0001., and you have upon records which anybody may consult evidence that those estimates which we afterwards had to consider were orieinally of much higher amount, for many lords. lieutenant of counties received instructions with regard to the militia which were subsequently suddenly revoked in consequence of the expenditure which the maintenance of that force would have occasioned. I am not at all quarrelling with or Carping at the Governmeat for makng these reductions. Unless the Opposition sometimes performs such services to the people I don't see what the
I use of an Opposition is. Orne of the duties of an Opposition
is to perform the part of a constitutional critic upon the Government, and if we succeeded in the object of our criticism I don't think we ought to "look a gift horse in the mouth." (Laughter.) With reference to the inoome-tax, the question whether the constant complaints which are made of its inquisitorial character and of its unequal, unjust, and unsatisfactory nature can be remedied by sohemes wbich any statesman can devise has been frequently discussed. Almost all pablic men agree that any scheme of that kind is quite impossible, and there has been a general accord in the country that at the expiration of a certain period the income-tax shall cease. Allow me to remind you that that period is now rapidly approaching, and it is for you to consider, it you wish to get rid of that tax, whether you should support a policy which has a tendenoy to the reduction of the public expenditure, and therefore to the consequent probability of getting rid of the income-tax altogether. You have also in a time of peace war taxes upon your tea and upon your sugar,and therefore we have not yet returned to the position in which we had a right to expect that we should find ourselves after the lapse of more than a year ainos peace was concluded. In looking to the means by which a reduction of taxation may be effected-by which we may carry out the adopted policy of Parliament by getting rid of the war taxes on tea and sugar, and ultimately, in 1860, altogether abolishing the income-tax, we have to consider the expenditure of the country, not only upon the military and naval, but upon the civil establishments, and we have also to consider the general polioy of the country as it affects expenditure. It is a fact that the public expenditure has increased to an enoraous amount during the las few years
The expenditure at the preaent nomenti ahows. 1 lbdieva, an increase of 6,000,0004* above the expenditure of 1852-3, when the Governmnent of Lord Dery was in office. When, therefore, we talk of reductions it is. after all, of reductions to the .aei of e period. vvhen tli estimates were very snuc
increased, an~~d when the public eStablihmlents of the country
Were in a very efficient state. Without dwelling too much uion this point, I may say I consider the general policy of the country, as I have described it to be, one which entails considerable expense. It is a policy whieh I am told is very popular; it is a policy of perpetual meddling in every part of the world (hear, hear), occasioningdisturbances which cause nae, andconsequently lead to increased estimates. I am that this is * veryspirited policy (laughter), that there is nothing like making the in. anence of England felt, and that there is nothing of which an Englishman should be more proud than to feel that he is like a Roman citizen in every part of the world. (aughter and cheers.) But I must say I generally find that this spirit, which I have described as " turbulent and aggressive," is always exhibited to weak and tjot to powerKf States. (Hear.) I find that Greece and Persia and China are perpetually the means by which the glory of British arms is to be established and ilustrated ("hear," and a laugh), but that we receive insults from Russia and Austria, and that two or three years ago we even received insults from France, which are passed over in silence, but ,which, if these States had been weak, would have been resented by the presence of admirals and generals. The prac. tical effect of this policy is to add to your expenditure 2,00,001. or 3,000,0001. a-year, and you must remember, when you consider whether the income-tax shall be reduced to 7d. or 5d., that the difference of 2,000,0001. between the sums raised by those rates of duty is probably the amount of expenditure occasioned by the expeditions and interferences resulting from your present policy. I have referred to the case of Persia, and 1 have shown you that, under diffioulties analogous to those which have recently taken place, we settled the Persian question without the expenditure of a single shilling. What wil the course adopted by the present Government of Lord Palmerston cost the country ? Will your bil be less than 1,000,0001., or Id. in the pouad of the income-tax? How, then, can you look forward to getting rid of the income-tax unless you exercise strict control over the conduct of tbe Government with respect to interference in foreign countries? (Hlear, hear.) This brings me to the question which it is said led to the dissolution of Parliament-our interference in China. 1I.am told the news which has just arved from China is itself a justification of the course adopted byHer Majesty's Government. Inthe first place, however, I am bv no means sure that news is true; but supposing for the sake of argument that it is trae, I dra w a totally different inference. I draw the inference that if the present Government had taken means to act upon the Emperor of China similar to those adopted by the Government of Lord Derby with regard to the Shah of Persia, we should probably have gained all the redress we required without resorting to the extreme, the wanton, and, I must say, the cruel proceedings to which we have had recourse, which have already involved us in great expenditure, and which may lead to increased expenditurs. It is the fashion-the fashion at least of the present Prime Minister -to call all Oriental Sovereigns barbarians (a laugh), but if they are barbarians I don't see why we should send Miinisters to their Courts. (" Htar," and laughter.) I don't suppose the Emperor of China is a greater barbarian than the Shah of Persia. Indeed, I have always understood that as contrasted with the Shah the Emperor of China is infinitely more civilized. (A laugh.) The Emperor of China is at this moment the head of a very weak Government, because his vast empire is torn by intestine disturbances, and a civil war which has lasted a considerable time, and may still continue for a long period, is being waged throughout the country. He is therefore in the exact position which would lead a Sovereign to be desirous of conciliating foreign Powers. Fifty years ago, wnen China was perfectly undisturbed and tranquil-when the authority of the Tartar dynasty was never impugned, but was regarded by the great bulk of the population with superstitious reverence, the Emperor might have received overtures from us with haughty superciliousnees; but in his present deserted and distressed condition, engaged in a severe domesticstruggle, nothing could be more contrary to his policy than to enter into a contest wiith the greatest naval rower in the world. I believe the present Government, had they made the attempt, would have been as successful with the Emperor of Chna as we formerly were with the Shah of Persia. It is curious that at the very time when the Minister of this country was describing the Eastern potentates as barbarians, and impressing upon the people that other than diplomatic interference would be required to bring them to their senses, he was actually negotiatig with a representative of the Shah of Persia, and has entered into a treaty with that representative hich, we are taught to believe, is quite satisfactory to Her Majesty's Government, and will settle every Question of difference betvween the two Powers. I say, then, if you want to reduce the taxation of the country-and al persons at the present day profess a desire to do so-if you want to get rid of war taxation, and to fulfil the contract betwee the Government, the Parliament, and the people with regard to the income-tax, you must impress upon the Administration of this country that their perpetual and unnecessary inter. ference with foreign States, and especially with weak States, is a policy whaich you will not sanction. (Cheers.) But if, on the other hand, you like the excitement of it-if you like to get up in the morning and hear that Canton is in flames, or that a sanguinary battle has taken place between the cavalry of our army and the Persian cavalry-if such excitement as this is necessary for the satisfaction of the English people, be consistent. Don't complain of your expanditure; don't complain of your taxes. JUiiderstand that you must pay war prices for the necessaries of life if you adopt such a policy, Agree that you will have a perpetual income-tax if you wat all this glory vwhich arises from vanquishing what we are told are barbarian potentates; but | don't say, " We will have fireworks and iUuminations for constant victories," and at the same time complain if the Government and Parliament call upon you for increased taxes or for the continuance of war imposts. (Cheers.) I have now touched upOn some of the principal circumstances which have occurred during the interval that has elapsed since I last stood upon these hustings. I have said elsewhere that the Chinese question was a pretext for the dissolution of Parliament. I believed it was a pretext, and I believe so still, and for this reason,-on the evening when Lord Palmerston announced his intention to dissolve Parliament, and to recur to the sense of the people, I thought it my duty to rise after him in the EHouse of Commons and to express my sincere conviction that he had taken a wise course, because the issue then was clear. The House of Commons had censured the policy which Her Majesty's Government had pursued in China, and if the Yinister felt that the country wms with him, that it entirely approved his policy, and was ready to back up Sir John Bowring and all the agents of the Government whose conduct I think has been unjustly assailed in the House of Commons, because I believe they acted entirely upon the instructions they had received,-if that was Lord Palmerston's opinion, I thought the dissolution was a wise and necessary course. But at the end of that night's debate Lord Palmerston, pressed by other members, aunounced that those very agents whose conduct was in question were virtually superseded, and that he was going to send out a very eminent man to China. (A Voice.-" They ought to have told you that before." Cheers and laughter.) They ought. If they had done so there would have been no division against the Government. (Hear, hear.) I say, therefore, that it was a pretext, because the issue that had been placed before the people of England-whether they approved the policy of
rir o. Bowrjg, which was the policy of the Governmentno longer existed, the Government having themselves virtually disa pproved his proceedings. At the same time I tell you fairly, I don't regret that the dissolution took place. (A voice, "You won't like the result thougb." Laughter and cheers.) Well, I consider I am as good a judge of the results of the dissolution as my friend. (Cheers and laughter.) He may possess better information oi many subjects than I do, and he may be able to do many things which I cannot do; but, as I have been in Parliament for 20 y ears, and as the principal object of my life has been to study the course of political events, I think the result of an election is one of those matters upon which I may suppose, without vanity, that I am as competent to form an opinion as the gentleman who interrupted me. (A^ voice, " Do you like the result as far as it is known 9 Give an answer, and don't chaff." Renewed laughter.) I wil telyou whyI am extremely glad there has been a dimolution, and why I shall be very weU satisfied with the result. I think the tendency of this dissolution will be to bring back what is necessary for the good government of this country-two -great political parties with definite opinions. My friend already nods approval. (Laughter and cheering.) I think there is nothing more disadvantageous than that the opinions of the foremost man in the country-as the Prime Minister of England must, nodoubt, alvaysbe-upon aUlvital questions of English politics should be unknown (hear), that they should be ambiguous, and that no two men in a country so essentiaUy political should be aware what are the opinions of the highest political authority upon the most important political questions. (Hear, hear.) I think this system, which prevailed in the last Parliament, would have continued for a very considerable period if the dissolution hadnot taken place, but I do not believe that ambiguity can now long exist. (Cheers. ) About a month ago Lord John Russell, who, I take it, is a very close and accurate observer of public life, said there was very great apathy in the country on the subject of Parliamentary reform. I agreed, and I do agree, with ILord John Russell upon that point, because, although we have heard a great deal of Parliamentary reform during the last fortnight, and opinions in favour of Parliamentary reform have been expressed in quarters from which they could net have been expected, they appear to me to be attributable to |the mnomentary excitemnent of the hulstis rather than to a.
fair recresentation of the feelings of any great body of the pq.ple. I have often seen that questions in wrhich the perople did not take much interest, although the interests of
the country were deeply involved, have, by the restlessness of a party, or by the mancmuvres of a statesman, suddenly become subjects of very great exoitement, and the country has been called to deoide upon them without any preparation or pre-consideration. The passions of the people have been excited; they have taken a course which they have afterwards regretted; and then they have complained that they have gained so little from measures from which they expected so much. I think, therefore, as prsons of great authority have dwelt on the question of Parliamentary reform, it would hardly become me, if you wish it, to shriek from touching upon it on this occasion. (Cheers.) It is of the greatest importane that, if this questiona should assume any magnituda, the people of Buckinghamshire should not be taken by surprise, and be led to oppeee what would be advantageous or to support what could only lead to disappointment. Now, there are two aspects in whoich w hat is called Parliamentary reform may be regarded, There are Parliamentary reformers, w ho are wFhat are called moderate men. They are in favour of what is termed "bit reform." Then there is another class of men who describe themselves as reai and earnest reformers, in favour of what are called " comprehensive measures. I wiU make one or two brief observations upon thesa two classes, not to dictate my opinion to you, but to offer some suggestions of which you may chew the cud (laughter) during the time that will probably elapse before I have the honour of meeting you again. I confess myself, that I am not a "bit by bit" reformer. There are, I think, many measures of Parliamentary change of a very moderate and partial character, which appear very plausible when described in newspapers.. and speeches; but I have invariably found that a r" hit by bit reform" aa r* gards Parliabient alwarys ends.int a job. (Laughter, sa
"Hear,Jiear".) Some~ ye.sr go an inuimense outcr -was, mad by-I don't mean, the term osffensively-tb
Liberal party-or, in deferenoe to a lhon, colleague (Mr. Cavendish), r wil saT the Whigs (ulauh-sgairsat the close boroughs of the Tories, and the People, acting rith the Whiga, said, "This is a most infamous system, and re will put an end to it." Well, they put an end to the close boroughs of the Toriee, but they Rite foTgot to put an end to the close borougbs of the Whigs (cheers anD laughter), aud ever since I have not found that the Whirs were at all inclined to reform in that respect. (Renewedlaughter.) After this great change ad taken place, in the course of events the power of what is called the Conservative party-the partr opo-ed to further changes of Parliamentary reform-was ciefly shown in the counties. The gieat demonstration of Conservative inflnence in the counties may be accounted for upon various grounds. Many years ago measures meacing the church were brought forward, and no doubt the clergy took great interest in the principles which were then discussed Subsequently there occurred a great industrial controrersy,
wbich is now happily settled, and the great body of I the middle class tho largest employers of labour-I the farmers of England-believing that the source of theirprofit was menaced by the pronosed changes, resented the intended legislation, and another great Conservative demonstration took place in the counties. The voice of the counties on that occasion was against the Whigs, or the great Liberal party, and another "bit by bit reform " was proposed, tampering with the county franchise. I don't give any opinion as to any particular schemes which have been brought forward upon that subject, but the instant the close boroughs were against the Whigs they wanted to destroy them, and the instant the counties were against the Whigs they proposed A bit by bit reform"-a " moderate measure"-ji order to affect the seats in the counties. In both the:e cases you wvdi find that a party object was really at the bottom of the measures, which were not brought forward after deep consideration for the general benefit of the commnunity; and therefore I am entirely opposed to "bit by bit reforms," however plausible they may appear upon paper. Let us look at what ae called comprehensive measures. It is well for you tolconsider howtheywill suit your interest. I have myself no superstitious reverence for the Reform Act of 1832. I believe that whenever British statesmen bring forward a measure of that importance their primary consideration is the interest of their country, whether they be Whigs, Tories, or Radicals. (Hear, hear.) That, no doubt, was the primary consideration of the authors of the Reform Bill; 'but there was a strong secondary consideration in the minds of the framers of that Act. The Whigs had been unfortunatly so long out of office (laughter) that they determined to frame the constituencies of the country in .a spirit which might probably insure their own continance in power ("He,hear" and laughter.) I believe there is no doubt that all the details of that measure were framed in opposition to the party with which I smpathize, and great injustice was done by those details as they affected the Tory or Conservative party, in respect to the disposition of political power. I think it very probable that, if a large reform bill were brought forward by the Tories, much o a evil mig'at be remledied ; bat it would he the greatest disadvantage to the country to have the two great partes competig forpowerby outbidding each other on that, of all subjects, in reference to which the general and permanent interests of the country should be considered. (Hear, hear.) Because, whatever schemes muight be devised by any party to establish and continue their power, the prescience of man is limited, and is frequently falsified by the course of events. Imprudent measures are often passed for the purpose of effecting a particular object, and afterwards the result expected is never realized. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, as far as I am concerned, rememDering the geat rtialitty and injustice of the scheme of 1832, should look to any great change in the representation with no prejudice, because I believe that much of that injusice and partiality might be remedied. But when you come to these comprehensive schemes, there are one or two points on which you should form your opinions. The earnest Reformers-those who were in favour of great measures-were particularly attached to two. Upon these, as they may be broaght forward on any day, it is desirable that the people of Bucsinghamshire should have matured opinions,-I mean the subjects of what are called electoral districts and the ballot. A. Voice.-" Aye, that is the most important ; thatisreal Reform."] Well, that gentleman wants electoral districts. A Voice.-" Together with the ballot.") I will deal with oth subjects, but first with electoral districts. The proposition for electoral districts is founded on this principle -that representation should depend on population. (Hear, hear.) A great many say that popalation and property are tyo different things; and, to simplify the argument, I w*M admit that population and property go together. ~But the real point to consider is that population and representation should go together, and to elfect that end it is proposed to have electoral districts. Now, consider the condition of the country, divided and out up into different electoral districts. Remember, there is no longer to be a county of Buckingham. (A voice, -" Quito right.") Buckinghamshireisto be blotted out of the political map, and probably you would have departnments, as in France, taking their names from the nearest nvers. There would be the departments of the Upper and Lower Thames, and are you prepaied to have votes in the department of the Upper Thames, and not to be electors of Buckinghamshire? (Cries of "Yea! " and " No !"1) There is an elector so false to the glory of Buckinghamshire and to the glory of his own position (cheers, and cries of *'Nonsense") that, ha is prepared to set the Thames on fire. (Laughter, and an ironi calcry of "That's sublime.") No, it is not sublime it is funny. I have heard of a step from the sublime; to the ridiculous, but my friend takes a step from the ridiculous to the sublime. (Cheers and laughter.) Bat, let us no longer exchange jokes, and let us try to resume the calm discussion in which we were engaged. Now, I cannot believe that the great majority of the inhabitants of this county do wish that such a geographical, political, and social change should take place as the blotting out ad easng the counay of Buckiugham from political existence. rA Voice.- " Why not 1"] I will tell you why not. My opinion is that the traditions of the people form part of their national character, and that a man cannot see the turfen road of Hampden, along which the great patriot went with his Petition of Rights; cannot behold the temple dedicated to the el nence of Chatham at Stowe, or the oak at Beaconseld under which Burke meditated his reflections on the French revolution, withoutfeeling proud of the country which was adorned bysuch distin-guished characters. (Cheers.) I want you to consider the question whether you would put an end to Buckinghamshire altogether. [A Voice.-" I would disfranchise it altogether."l (Laughter. ) I do not thinl- you are one of the electors of Buckinghamshire. (The Voice.- "Yes, I am l') Then you ought not to be. (Cheers and laughter.) I contend that if you pursue this policy you put an end not only to Buck-inghamshire but to the country, for the country does not consist of mere animals having a vote and Hving on a territory, bat of men proud of the past and hopeful of the future-men who are animated to do their duty because they are the successors of men who have done their daty. (Cheers.) Therefore the policy which the hon. gentleman who has just interrupted me professes and adheres to is a selfish policy, which never can make the country great or keep it famous. (Great cheering.) Well, all I can say is that I am entirely oDposed to any change of that kind, and that I believe it is a policy which would end in the degradation of England. (Cheers.) I wish to impress particularly on the dwellers in the south that if this new scheme should find favour you will sink in political and social importance. This, instead of bhing a county which had, acted a great part in history and produced famous men and pa55ed great measures, would only be a portion of an insignificant district, and you, the inhabtiants, never would enjoy that conscious feeling of pride and superiority which, as electors of the county of Buckirghlam, you have a right now to feel. (Loud cheers.) I think the feeling of this meeting is not in favour of electoral districts, but 1 do not wish to force or elicit any opion. Let me make one or two observations on the ballot. I know there are many persons, for whose opinions I feel great respect, in favour of the ballot, but it is of the utmost importance that we should calmly consider the conditions on which the ballot is to be established. In the first place, I think all must agree that the ballot withouta very great extension of the suffrage is impossible. It would be a tyranny unsupportable that the electors of this country, who now under the law enjoy, and for centuries have enjoyed, the privilege of voting-for the power of voting is a privilege, and not a right or trust-I say it would he intolerable that the electors should exercise this privilege in secrecy, without being subject to that fair criticism and control which all possessors of public privileges ought to experience. (Applause.) Her Majesty has privileges; her prerogatives are privileges, bat they are not privileges exercised in secret, and it must be an infinitely smaU minority who woald for a monment entertain the idea that with the present electoral body the ballot is justifiable or endorable. (Hear, hear.) I assume, therefore, that if the ballot were introduced it must be introduced together with a great extension of the suffrage. Well, you wiU have to consider that which is an important question, but which the supporters of the ballot like to evadewhether the ballot, if introduced, must not be accompanied with plurality of voting. Understand, you are to have in connexion with the ballot a very extensive suffrage, say household suffrage, exercised in secret. Wel, do you mean to say that a lord-lieutenant of a county is to have no more influence on the legisation and government of the country than some man, poerhaps, in his service. and receiving weekly wag,es, but in consequence of the
tenure of a house exercising the franchise- There must, then, be plurality of voting ; but how are you to fix the limit tiid the degree ? Is the working man -who gets in manufactories 1Lh or 25a. a-week to have one vote, and the man with 50,0001. to have 50,000 votes? (Cries of "No !") Then, where is the limit? ("H He is only a man," and laughter.) I for one say I would rather have an equal and open vote than a secret vote and be subject to plurality of voting. (Hear, hear.) [An tilector.- "' I want the voters to be protected."] Do you means that every man is to have a vote and to exercise it in secret? Do you mean that property is to have no influence on the election of membeis of Parliament? The experiment had been tried in other countries, and what had been the result? The French are not inferior-perhaps they are superior-to us in intelligence, and only a short time back they elected their Parliament by ballot and universal suffrage. They elected a body of men who exercised no control or influence upon opinion. Depend upon it, the reason why the Parliament of England, with al its faults
lasted so long is that it consists of men to whom, on account of their family, intelligenee, property,' or character, the grest body of the country has always looked up. (Cheers.) You may have a fleeting and vagabond population in Parliament. Men may come in and go out at a general election by accident; but if a man is a considerable time in Parliament you may be sure tbat, whatever his deficiency, and however little any party may sympathize with him, he has someroot inthesympathies of his countrymen. (Applause.) The very first moment that this Parswept away, and a military despotism established. thelieve that to bo the only government suitable to that spiritedand liament in France did not do exactly what the people wanted they naturally said,. "W ho are you? We re as good as you." And -when the Yrmnch ?arliament was in danger from, another unthority 1 t8e people never rallied round it, and it ws inasint* irtellgent people.

IRELAND.
CORK (COUNTY).-Mr. S. Lawlor, the independent Oppositionist, and decidedly a favourite with the bulk of the Liberal electors, has suddenly announced his intention to retire from the contest. In his valedictory address, says the Co-* Eixminer,
"Mr. Lawlor states that a copy of a letter which bo had addressei to lr. M'b'artby, prumssidg not to,,ppose him, and the btringency of which he did not rememiiber. had been forwarded to him, and that the terms of this letter, in the o1,sion of two geutlean to whom he had

"Captain Barry, of Balhsclough, has a4dressed the electors of the coun ty. as he has done on forsser occasions. The eapten'u statement of his views is in the stle of a desp.tch-briet and soldierlike. He bar declared him-elf on several subje-ts with a directness and candour whicb we wish ali candidates would imitate. The gallant raptain teems to be of the same oplnisn as his lighting counrtrymaau, who thought It an unuatifacbeory thin ithat th"se should be only two parties lea dlspute, aud therefore usnally coustituted himself a third party.

Mr. Vincent Scully is determined to go to a poll, although one would think his chances of success are almost hopeless.
DiYBuLN (CourNY).-The Liberals are in high hopes of partially retrieving their defeat in the city by ejecting one of the late county members. They speak confidently (perhaps too much so) of placing SirO. Domvileat the head of the poll.
I DUNDALK.-Tt will have been seen that the Moouites have started MIr. M1. Cantwell, one of the ablest men of the clique, for the borough of Dnndalk, with a view of ousting Mr. George Bowyer, the equally able chamnpion of ultramontanism, in its widest sense. The clergy are aul, or nearly all, in favour of Mr. Bowyer,'but, as the issue will be settled this day, it would be useless to speculate on the probable result of the contest.
WItSTMAI.TH (COUNTY).-While the meeting was being held inl Mullinpr on Saturday, at which Sir Benjamin Chapman presiJed, a deputation of rev. gentlemen pro. ceeded to Donore house, and there offered all their support and influence, aided by the Lord Bishop of Meath, Dr. Cantwell, to Captain Walter Nugent, 33d Regiment, eldest son of Sir Percy Nugent, in the event of his standing for the connty in conjunction with Sir Richard Levinge. The deputation waR respectfully received by the gallant captain, who, after having heard a full statement of the object of their mission, pslitely declined to accede to the request, on the ground of the circumstances under which the offer was made, and the near approach of the election, further intiismating that lie thought it not very complimentary to call upon a member of his family as a dernier r essort when applications in other quarters had failed altogether. The galant eaptain's father, Sir Percy Nugent, was present during this interview, but did not interfere.
WFXFORI) ( COUNTY).-An opponent to Mr.John George, the late Derbyite representative, has come forward in the person of Mr. Hatolsell, son of the Right Hon. John

LONDOZN, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 18.57.
The elections have already totally changed the whole face of the political heavens. We are no longer as we were a fortnight ago, as regards either this Chinese question or a dozen others of much older and nearer interest. People do not now ask who will be in the new Parliament, but exclaim, "What a Parliament there will be out of doors!" The expurgation not only of vicious, but even of some meritorious elements, proceeds almost too rapidly. When the House of Commons meets it will be with the serious consciousness that a great number of its most active and able spirits are discontented exiles, moving heaven and earth, and ready to go lower still, to obtain readmission. It will be in the case of the Celestial Empire, besieged by " outer barbarians," or "foreign devils," as the vagrant sympathies of some will entitle them to be called. Outside of the House, agitating, haranguing, w;iting, plotting, combining, and all but coalescing, will be COnDEN, BnaoHT, M GIBSxN, MIL, and W. J. Fox ; thenes will be &ir J. WALmsry, A. PzTLATT, Sir W. CL&, WUXIXN5&, and OLxVEIRA; the?e will be ]AYARD, a3A other free knights ,, there will aibo be abseeh CORmWEML, ROrUgIlSn ?AI'xEx the two PMoM, Birxv, M^: OjxRs,, ana a h1 ofh otbas, wa*re o-citm. dl vglap d,or 1.4MgEage day to
distinguish themselves. All of tlits will be in outer darkness, yet not at all hopeless of readmission. Indoors there will be positive gaps in the debate,-cries for Co.Dmx or M. GiBsoN, and no ConDEn to FAand up. lis own purge has operated too effectively by half, for he has turned the House out of doors. Like the old lady in the nursery rhyme,-he has sold his bed and now lies upon straw. In the House we should think the result will be a little more calmness and decency of discussion, and a little less of that peculiar style of oratory which has recently been imported from " the bright region of the setting " sun" into the British House of Commons. Even Mr. GLADsToE -mnay practise the propriety which he may not, perhaps, feel, whern he sees that he has thundered his house down on his own head. There is just a hope that in the comparative tranquillity of the new House some youthful members, hitherto crushed, stunned, and tongue-tied, may find courage and opportunity to make themselves heard. Now, at least, is their time, and the sooner they apply themselves to rescue the House from the tyranny of rant the easier will they find it.
But, as we have observed, there will now be a Parliament out of doors. There will be two Oppositions, who will, no doubt, be quite as ready to nmerge little differences as on a recent occasion. The country will be brought back to the state of things before the Reform Act, that almost forgotten antediluvian era, when it was said that Parliament must be reformed, for the talent out of the House was too strong for the talent within. We may be sure there wil be a prodigious cry for a new Reform Bill. It stands to reason there must be one. Can that system be a good one, it will be asked, under which COBDEN has had to give up the West Riding, and be thrown out of Huddersfield ? Would the Balot have returned two respectable manufacturers for Manchester ? Would any of the other casualties have occurred? With a large Electoral District, Household Suffrage, and Vote by Ballot, would not MrALr., PELLATT, WILKINSON, Sir W. CLAY, and a dozen other men of the people, have been returned at tho head of the poll? Of course, there wil now be a cry for Reform as incessant and loud as the storm at the gates and walls of a beleaguered city. The excluded will not be satisfied with a moderate measure, and the longer they have to wait the less easy wil they be to please. There are, indeed, some considerations to suggest a little breathing-time. In the first place, we have a good many other things to do besides polishing up an old Constitution; and, in the second place, as a new Reform Act of a serious character must be followed immediately by a dissolution, it is well to consider whether we are ripe yet for another general election. If, then, we notice what we have little doubt will be the chief cry of the new Parliament, in or out of doors, it is in order that our public men may prepare their minds for a strong measure before very long. There is no need in these days that anybody should connimt himself against Reform. Happily there are no iron-headed Lord Chancellors of twenty years? standing; no third-class statesmen, who survive only as traditions of an anti-revqlutionary war; no famous old Dukewith only two notions of politics, -obstinate resistance and final retreat. There is no reason why everybody should not hold himself entirely free, unfettered, and uncompronised on this question; and, considering the changes which public opinion is likely to undergo in the controversy, it is better everybody should beware of committing himself. Many a reputation was wrecked through want of this caution at the last Reform Bill; many a good man was lost to the State; and what, perhaps, is a more serious evil than either, many a conscientious man first learnt to stifle the dictates of private judgment in the frenzy and hubbub of a political "faction fight."
If there must be a pause of a year or two before the measure be brought into form, it ought to gain, instead of losing, by the delay. We want a comprehensive measure, and one which will set the subject at rest for many years. As for the partial and one-sided proposals which have been brought forward of late, and the rejection of which has been much insisted on during the election controversies, it is to be observed that the most prominent of them, Mr. Locexz {Ih'G'S motion, has nothing to do with the very important elections of last week. They were town, not county elections, and decided by 61., not even 101. householders. Nor is it really probable that Vote by Ballot or equal Electoral Disitricts would have affected such elections as those of Manchester, Huddersfield, Southwark, the Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, and other large constituencies. Disappointed candidates will ever be ready to believe that with a fairer field and less favour they must have been more successful; but there are considerations always at work which no electoral system can obviate. In the present instance it is evident that some of the disappointed eandidates nmst have sadly underrated the force of those feelings which go under the general name of patriotism. Was it reasonably to be expected that the population should rise to advocate the right of a fellow like Yen to pull down the British flag flying over a peaceful vessel engaged in British trade, and carry away the crew, for the purpose of beheading an old man who was said to be the father of a pirate? Englishmen must be very much altered since we formed our first and freshest impressions of them, if any ingenuity whatever can persuade them not only into allowing th;s, but even into an enthusiasm for it and its author, his defenders, and abettors. No Parliamentary Reform would have made any difference here. No imaginable apparatus, no scale of suffrage, no equality of divisions, nothing whatever short of driving the voters up to the hustings and making them vote for Messrs. COBDEN and GLADSTONE on penalty of death, would have affected the result. It is the old English heart and the simple English nature which have done the work here. From all kinds of constituencies, great and small, popular and close, there has been the same result. For our part we never desired, or even imagined, that an appeal would be made to the people on such a question. To us it seems
the height of absurdity that any men professing to be statesmen should force such an appeal upon the Minister. He had no choice, however, but to accept it in behalf of the people, ancl, confident as we were as to the result, we were satisfied the appeal had been made. That satisfaction increases every day, andl England may now be congratulated on a Parliament elected not upon any measure or political difference, but simply on an appeal to the natural feelings and common sense of the people.
The "Ordinary Revenue" is now so much under
The " Ordinary Revenue" is now so much under the influence of extraordinary changes, such as taxes coming into bearing or going out of bearing, drawbacks upon stocks in hand, and postponemonts of payment in consequence of anticipated roductions of duty, that few of the figures in the Quarterly Accounts are to be rceived without explanation. When, then, it is stated that The net increase of the Revenue for the year just ended, as coxmpared with the previ6us year, is 2,525,06ol., and that the net increase ox the quarter is 115,04Z., both theme figures show, in some respeccs more, and other reshpects lus, than the fact. If -we begin with the return, for the quarter, tl,.e Customs show ,a ndt qiceasm of 296,53'i2 The fact, howev-, 1is lit there has. bee ii a considerable
mg. generay in. the Csoms, but it
has all been absorbed, and the differencoe turned the wrong way, by a loss of 800,0001. through the reduction of the daties on tea and sugar. The Excise for the quarter, thoug.h affected by changes of duty, still indicates an actual improvement, and shows. a net increase of 91,2221. The Stamps show an increase of 103,9371., arising from a general improvement, but chiefly from stamps on legal instruments and the Legacy and Succession Daties. The Assessed Taxes show an increase of 11,0001. on the quarter; the Property tax 61,5121. The increasing correspondence of the country shows itself by an improvement of 16,8481. in the receipts of the Post-office. Considering, then, that the quarter just ended participates very slightly in the addition of taxes, and very ldrgely in their reduction, the result is favourable.
The financial measures which have affected the Revenue of the year are sufficiently fasmiliar to the public, though few take such interest in finance as to be aware when and how the changes made by any particular act of the Legislature come into operation. Thus the increase of about two millions and a half in the Revenue of the year just ended is far from representing the whole improvement in the Revenue. The repeal of the war duty on malt, and the consequent repayment on stocks of malt in. hand, have lessened the Excise receipts of the year 1856-7 by about a million. The loss by the reduction on tea and coffee exceeds another million. This, however, will be partly made up in the present year, as the payment of dcuty has been postponed for the benefit of the reauction. Rad there been no change, the improvement of the Revenue on the whole year just ended would not have faUen short of four millions. Owing to the above reductions the Customs for the year show only an increase of 287;8141. In other items, besides tea and coffee, there has been an aggregate increase of 1,300,0001. Notwithstanding the immense repayments on malt, the Excise for the year shows an increase of 853,8481. In spirits there has been an increase of about 1,000,0001.; in hops, 630,0001.; and in paper, 120,0001. Owing to the long credit given, the present year will be largely affected by the repeal of the malt duty. Thus far the decrease of Rlevenue from this source has been considerably counteracted by increased consumption.
No Deficiency Bills, it appears, will be required in the ensuing quarter. This is a result of very rare occurrence, and highly creditable to our finances. On the whole, we think the country may be safely congratulated on the rapidity with which we return to a regular system, and are able to dispense with those extraordinary rezources which constitute our chief provision for war. In finance it is evident we can set all sail, and draw in to any amount, at discretion; and wa do not allow the disturbing influences of war to spoil the consequent peace, nor its extravagant expenditure to grow into a habit. We are fast paying our debts, and, though we do not think it necessary to have before us a long financial programme, yet we are satisfied that for some years to corme the Revenue, in whatever hands it may be placed, will exhibit as satisfactory results as in the table before us.
The management of our Joint-Stock Establish-
The management of our Joint-Stock Establishments is becoming a disgrace to the country and a scandal to the world. At the very minute that the affairs of the Royal British Bank are under exposure in the Court of Bankruptcy those of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation are produced exactly in tine to mainitain the public indignation at its height. This concern was established with the especial function of conducting banking and exchange transactions with our Indian Empire, and is just three years old. Its capital appears to have been half-a-million, of which 250,0001. was paid up as an adequate fund, at any rate for the commencement of operations. The business contemplated was extensive in its scope, and offered opportunities of large and regular profits without any extraordinary risk. Such were the prospects of the London and Eastern Bank in the year 1854. On Wednesday last, at a meeting of the proprietary, the actual state of its affairs, after 36 months' existence, was disclosed, and it was then found that every sixpence, or nearly so, of the shareholders' money was gone. The direct liabilities of the establishment amounted to 397,7341., while from its assets, after allowing for probable losses, it was computed that 413,4501. might be realized; so that, though the creditors of the Bank may anticipate payment in full, the balance remaining after the settlement of their claims would be something short of 16,0001. to meet the 250,0001. contributed from the pockets of the shareholders. If this small margin should disappear in the actual work of winding-up j every penny of the original investment will have been sunk and lost since 1854.
The history of these transactions is briefly told. Considerably more than the whole paid-up capital of the Bank was borrowed from the Bank itself by its own Directors, one of whom, in his own proper person, received no less than 237,0001., while 47,3501. was distributed among four others. For these advances securities of various kinds were represented as producible. The large sum was lent upon mortgages of estates in Surrey and Dorsetshire, at a rate of no less than 10 per cent. interest on the money; the other loans were made upon shares in the Bank itself, steam shares, houses, and so forth. What may have been the general principles adopted in the management of the concern is a point for conjecture only, but anything worse than the proceedings disclosed it is impossible to conceive.
If there is one principle of bankdng better established than another it is that advances should be made in small rather than in large sums, and, above all, not for lengthened periods or upon. securities not readily convertible. Here, however, is a Bank in its very infancy advancing upwards of nine-tenths of its entire paid-up capital in a single sum, and upon the security of landed property. That 10 per cent. should be paid upon the bargain appears rather an aggravation than a justification of the transaction, for it cannot be presumed that a rate so much above that ordinarily current could have been obtained without such a proportionate risk as would render the investment an improper one for a Bank. Of the other securities referred to some were expressly described as insufficient to cover the advances which had been made upon them, and the " large losses"' for which the accountant made allowance in presenting the balance-sheet of the concern point evidently to a general Rmisapplication of the funds of the- Bank, notwithstanding the lea,itimate and attrsive sphere of business which lay before it.
Reprehensible, however, as such a course -would be even under ordiuary circumstances, it becomes infinitely woxse when the recipients of these advances are the Dectors thensserves, and when a species of business disadvanta3eos to the Bank is transacted feo the advantage of those whose special duty it a to protect and priomote its interests by the preventior- of any such doings. The Commissioners in Br;nkrupity observed the other day that it would be a -ery beneficial rule if Directors would not di3count with their own Banks, aud the miso iadeed, df uch delalings must ba- obvious to 4sk 2 &authorities-become,: imdek such cixwwatanaw, the judges i +Aek own cjeWe, aid ve compelled to pro
nounce upud the character eof applieatiovs and the nature of wcities, whichf it is at one and the same moment their duty to scixtinize and tLsir interest to recommend. The very functioa of .3 Manager or a Board is to decide upon cases involving advances or investments. As Banks deal in money, and as, lMik other establishments, they are exposed to competition, they must occaion3aly make advances from their fands, with some little amount of risk, and the prosperity of trade, indeed, depends in ne smal degree upon the assistance which homest ihnstry can thus command. The duty cf the covtrolzig authorities is to see that tis, buminesa is carried on upon safe and legitimate pncipies-upon such principles as will a3 once bring eusteos
to the Bank and secure the inrests 9f the p-oprietors. Nothing, however, can be clearer thiu thl these interests must always be jeopardized when the authorities become customes-n themselves,, and when applications for advances are brought fow consideration before none but thw applitants am& their colleagues. It is iseless to. allege, as ha| recently been done, that such transactions takethe shape of the ordinary business of the RanIl. That they should do so, except in meae matters- of form, is impossible, for the ordinary control. due on behalf of the Bank disappeaas frem the very mature of the transaction itself.
We sincerely trust that effectual measures may be devised by the Legislature for obviatEng, if possible, such scandals as have lately been exposed to the world; but we should be failing in oUD duty if we did not also urge upon al concerned in Joint-stouk Establishments the absolute necessity of exercising some personal vigilance in the protection of their property. From the examples recently made public it is clear that the liabilities involving such grievous risks do not arise from anything inherent in the nature of Banks alone, but attach in a - similar manner to other Joint-stock Associations. The Australian Agricultural Company finds its iminediate resources exhausted; the North of Europe Steam Company has lost 10 per cent. of its capital in the course of a few months; and in each of these cases the facts seem to have burst upon the shareholders to their utter astonishment. In the latter instance even the Board of Directors were in ignorance of the state of things, the Manager having been left to administer the affairs of the Company without interruption. It is impossible to overlook the fact, that the machinery of Joint-stock Associations, however it may admit of improvement, does nevertheless provide considerable security for the shareholders, if they would exercise their rights and avail themselves of their opportunities with unremitting care. At the periodical production of accounts it must certainly be practicable both to verify the figures given and to asceltain upon positive evidence the actual character and value of the assets for which credit is taken. The whole concern, in fact, is the concern of the proprietary at large ; theirs are the interests concerned, and theirs is the power of management. That this management should be committed to the hands of a few is necessary for the very despatch of business; that many, after this delegation of their authority, should place an uninquiring confidence in the depositaries of the trust must always in the nature of things be expected; but there should still be keenness and activity enough in the body of the shareholders to see to the realization of that security which the law already provides.
Happily for the good fame of the English people
Happiiy for the good fame of the English people it is seldom that we have to record an outrage such as has just disgraced the town of Kidderminster. In these days there is hardly a politician who rejects the appellation of " Liberal," and has not a favourable word for the people and the extension of their rights. What is the cause of this change? Simply that we all feel that draing the present generation education, morality, and humanity have enlarged their dominion over all classes. It is not too much to say that the tradesman of our time is in instruction and political knowledge the equal of the squires who legislated for us 50 years ago, and that the artisans of to-day are not inferior to the middle class who supported Church and State under Prrr and SimmouTr. No one no w dares to talk of the " swinish multitude" or the " besotted herd." Mobs may be ill-clothed, il-fed, and ill-mannered, but we had trusted that the days of riot and murderous brutality had passed away. Such a transaction as this at Kidderminster shows how inveterate are the instincts of barbarism and ignorance, and how continually, even in the midst of philanthropical endeavours and spreading education, we must be prepared for the outbreaks of passion and the plottings of malignity. We are far, however, from wishing to generalize from the acts of a gang of ruffians to the character of the English working class. On the contrary, this is pre-eminently a case where the exception proves the ruIe. The very fact that the outrage of Saturday last has awakened through the country a general feeling of indignation is sufficient to show how far such events are from forming part of the ordinary current of EDglish life. Nothing like it has occured during the present elections; nothing like it can we remember in the transactions of 1852 or 1847. We are not a vindictive nor even a passionatepeople. NVe can differ without anger, and be rivals without hostility. Our politicians respect each other at the hustings and in the Senate, and the constituencies have imbibed the moderation which characterizes the Legislature. Ordinarily the bitterness of an election scarcely survives the day of polling, and the voters are perfectly ready to take the advice of the besttempered among them, and, satisfied with having fought well, to forget that they had fought at all.
This Kidderminster contest, we are happy. to say, was no' of the ordinary kind. Neither the Liberal nor the Conservative party is. responsible for its scandalous results. Mr. IowF, the representative of the borough in the laWo Parliament, and a member of the Government,, was fronm the beginning certain of re-election. He waa opposed only by a Mr. BoycoTT, a local solicitor, and it was the more disreputable paa;isans of this, gentleman who were the planners and perpetrators of the atrocity. We gather from various oaarters a sufficiently accurate narrative of what, pUsed on the day of polling. It r.U evident f-ro
the first that the rival-of Lov. oi had IU> chance with the electors. But. he had %rith the, lower classes of the town that kind c; popularity which is always attainable b.y a local eelebrity who chooses to work for it. It ppears i*at the nonelectors have been for nan.y years at Kiddersinsier active sharers in the more demonsra-tive proceedings of election times. On the pieaegt oeeasion the mob had been raised to a high pitch of excitement by the addresses of lAr. Bo-zosr and his friends. Mir. Lowe had been, represented, in the usual style of electioneering . oratory, as caring nothing for the interests of 4Ase borough, and as & partyto the maintenamce o L excessive txation. Mlr. Lowz :would not £upport Kidderminster institutions. Mr. LOwZ awanted to keep up the high price of tea. . The 'consequences of this kind of speaking threatereed to be serioius even- before the day of polling cam-e.' It is said that the attack which took place was pEobably orgaized the night before, for the electos in. favour- of M. LowE were v.,arned thzt' tkey niighW Iavehsoine difficult iD
- back from the poll; and heaps of stones were actully pileda up by the Bide
d' the I7n& which led from the hustingg to' -e& tbj,. By a singular aflangementr the iAiUWtgn 'were erected nearly a mile from the tof,^ and the Iiberal electors were foroed to pass threugh a long naow street, the strongholc o.f Mr. l cores pmitisans, and the .head-quarters of his committee. The police were, as might b& expeted, zmluer-ly insufficient, and the special constables wwe taien from the class over which M1r. BoycoTT eseially exercioed hiz influence. The voting weld firom te faz+t in favou of Mr. LowF, and the rage of hi oppoeets increaeed every hour. The' tahrday half-hoday brought a large addition LP the numbers of the malcontents. Mr. Love- wass assailed with stone. in the middle of thts day, and. wamed by those who- knew the temper of the xob- not to appear again at the htvbtingir, Thi- ad&ic waw -anfuRly, yet, as the evt-proied,- tmibrtielbdisregarded. About halfsn4ioi* befora the, cl05se of the poll the suppor-M-rs * d' Mr.. Eoyeorff attaeked the side of the hkstngs ecupiel by the succeasful candidate and hii- fiemir3;: showers of stones -ere hurled at tham,; atd: ftbvr: their crowded position, took cer%inf eEct: When, the poll closed the rage of the mob rose to, its height. Loud threats we--* utteed, a,u-ne the life of t*e elected mem-koer' ancd his- pro-' poser, and preparations were mad- for corm-- mencing the long premeditated at:uck. XiI. Boy-- COTr, according to one account,. requested the crowdE to be quiet; according to .riother, he de-
clined to interfere in any way. AB aU-events; itis- certain that he almost immedftgy quitted the hastingswiLh his friends, and left his-opponenti 'at the mercy of the infuriated mob. The public will judge for itself of this act. Whether the Kiddermister populace had been excited- by MIsown oratory or that of his friends, or -whether their fu was the result of some unieiglble impulse, certain it is that they meditated and had threatened the deadliest vengeanoe cT Mr. Loas, and Mr. BoycoT7 ISew it. How far, then, it was consistent with courtesy, with good feeling, with common humanity, to leave the place, bowing and EsIiling among the shouts of his partisans, whex his adversary and a number of his fellow-townsmen were in danger of their lives, it will be for
every well-thinking person to determine for-- hiTaself. The departure of Mr. BoYcorr wasthe signal for the ruffians to come to close quarters. The booth was attaceled with yells and execrations, and it was necessary to protect Mr. LowE and his friends as they left the booth. The police formed, and, with the member, his proposer, and friends, commenced to fight their way along the lane. They were stoned all the way. "OOn each side of us," says Mr. Gumar, the County Court Bailiff, " the mob, 15 or "20 deep, were throwing stones with all their "might. They were well armed. The women "had stones in their aprons; the men had their "pockets flled; every stone found a target in sthe body of some one of our number.
"In this way we ran the gauntlet for 250 yards, "losng one of our number at every stride. Those
who fell were savagely kicked by the brutes "around; and several policemen were disabled in "rescuing them from their brutal assailants." There is little more to be said. Mr. Lown was saved from assassination by the courage of Mr. JSomc SHEPPIRr, who dragged him into his house, covered with blood, and with a severe injury on the skul. Almost every one of the devoted party was more or less injured. We are glA to learn that Mr. Lows is progressing favourably, and trust he will be before long restored to health. The excitement in the town has so little subsided that it was judged expedient on Monday to send for a detachment of cavalry. We need not say that the respectable portion of the community, witbout distinctio3l of party, are in the highest degree indignant at the ruflianly outrage, and the coldness and callousness exhibited by individuals who might have done much to prevent it. The attack is felt to have been most scandalous and unprovoked, inasmuch as the contest was carried on by the succesful candidate with the most perfect fairness and good feeling. We are told that " the LowE party " made no gestures of menace or triumph, and did "not attempt to insult or coerce any one; that "Mr. Lows has never iu one instance descended "to personalities ; and his party have not as much "as published a single squib or placard reflecting "on MIr. Boycour or any of his party." OnI such transactions we may well wait for the spontaneous verdiet of public opinion. We, may indeed congratulate the country that such a scene as has just been enacted at Kiddernminster is sufficiently rare to be the subject of astonishment and disgust. The courtesy ancd honourable spirit with which several hundredE elections have been carried on throughouit the three kingdoras, among constitencies of al mumbers and eharaeters, is a proof how little brutality and violence form a necessary part of civil eontests; and consequently how deep is the diso,race on al- who perpetrated or abetted the shameful act we have related.

i[The following appeared i our second edition of yes. terdav -1
(FROM OUPR OWNW COPRESPONDENT.)
FARIS, MARCr 30, 6 P.M.
The Conference on the Neuchatel question was to have met to-day, but did not, the Swiss PlenipQtentiary not being yet prepared with a categorical answer to the propositions of M. de Hatzfeldt. Colonel Barmann, the resident Swiss M[inister, had an interview to-day with Count Walewaki. The distance between what Prussia proposes and what Switzerland demands,even on the hypothesis that the conditions mentioned in the Indgpendance and other Belgian papers are correct, is sufficiently wide for an approach to be made without large concessions on one side or the other, if not on both. But I have reason to believe that the real propositions are not such as have been stated, and that they are, in point of fact, much harder. If the Swiss be dissatisfied on account of the delay that has taken place, and the non-fulfilment of the promises and hopes held out to thenu months ago, they will very probably be much more so in a few days hence, when the real conditions on which the King of Prussia agrees to renounce his sovereignty are known. In the meantime, the representatives of France and England are doing their best to smooth the way to an arrangement.
It is said that the intervention of the British and French Governments for the arrangement of the existing differences between the Austrian and Sardinian Governments has been favourably received, and it is hoped that diplomatic relations will be restored sooner than expected.
The negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce between the French and Russian Governments are concluded, and the treaty will soon be reduced to writing. M. Baudin, First Secretary to the French Embassy at St. Petersburg, is appointed to conduct the negotiations.
Captain Roussin, Commander of the steam sloop Averne. who is appointed to proceed to the mouths of the Danube, to be stationea there, has been summoned to Paris to receive special instructions from the Government. The Averne is at Toulon, undergoing repairs.
It has been decided that Admiral Hamelin, Minister of Marine, accompanied by the Board of Admiralty, will proceed to Toulon to receive the Grand Duke Constantine, who will proceed to England after having visited France.
A private letter from Senegal announces that the frigate Nemaesis, bearing the flag of Admiral Rigault de Genouilly, anchored in the roads on Feb. 28, coming from Brest. The Nemesis was to Pail immediately, and to continue her course to China, -where it was expected she would arrive in May, and join the squadron under Admiral Guerin.
It appears that the Episcopal Chapel in the Rue d'Aguesseau, Paris, built by Bishop Luscomb, and lately the property of the Rev. Mr. Chamier, has been purchased by the British Government, and will henceforth serve as the chapel for the British Embassy. As the service at the Ambassador's resi. dence will be discontinued after Easter, there will then be only two places of worship in Paris for members of the Church of England. It is supposed that the gaUeries of the chapel will be retained for the persons attached to the Embassy, as well as for those residents who prefer, by the payment of a fixed sum for their sittings (which will go towards defraying the current e.xpenses of the chapel), to secure for themselves the opportunity of attending Divine worship, from which, at certain seasons of the year, the enormous influx of visitors would exclude them.
A great number of the large trees in the Champs Elysees are undergoing the process of being stripped of their rough outer bark to a height of 20 feet and upwards, with a view of destroying the worms that are bred and harboured in the interstices of the bark, and which, by piercing the trees with innumerable holes, prevent the sap from rising, and cause their premature decay.
A letter from Venice of the 20th inst. announces that a painting by Paul Veronese, for three centuries the property of the Pisani family, has been purchased by the British Govermuent for 14,0001. sterling.
Trade in Paris was a little more animated last week than the week preceding. The shopkeepers who suffered their stocks to run low are now forced to replenish them, even at an advanced price. It is expected that the spring trade will become more active in the course of the next 15 days. Accounts from the manufacturing districts state that business is still dull at Rouen and Mulhouse, but that at Roubaix, St. Quentin, Rheims, and Aniens appearances are more promising. The new stuffs composed of wool, with a mixture of cotton, are more sought than the manufactures of Rouen. Letters from Lyons state that orders have been received there for rich silks, velvets, embroidered shawls, and figured waistcoats, of which there is a great variety of patterns, and for which the Lyons manufacturers are unrivalled. Satin articles likewise, which had long been neglected, are now coming into favour. Since raw silk has become so dear the Lyons manufacturers confine themselves to the preparation of expensive stuffs, from w-hich alone they can derive any profit. There is a remarkable fall in the price of leather to be remarked in this market, and the stock of that article is increasing. This decline in price is attributed to the substitution of moleskin for the common hide. The War and NavyDepartanents have given large orders for articles to be made of moleskin. The railway companies likewise have adopted it. It has been ascertained that for strength and durability it is equal to calfskin, and is from 50 to 60 per cent. cheaper. It is expected that the opening of the Bordeaux and Cette Railway will considerably increase the trade of the French port3 on the Atlantic, and companies are already formed to transport by coasting vessels to Bordeaux the merchan,dise intended for the Mediterranean. A letter from Morlaix announces that in that town alone ten vessels are being got ready for that service. There was a further decline in the Paris corn-market last week. All the provincial markets are well supplied, and there are but few speculative purchases made. At Marseilles, since the demand has ceased for Spain and Portugal, the corn-market has declined daily, and furtherlarge supplies are expected there from Southern Russia during the month of April In the last Paris market holders of wheat were forced to submit to a reduction of lf. on the sackof 120kilogrammesto effect sales. Theappearance of the growing crop ismagnificent,andthefariaers desire to dispose of their stock on hand. Flour fell in the Paris market Ilf. the sack. The best quality was offered at 74f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The sale of wine is easy at Bercy, and prices are firm. At Bordeaux trade is dull, but without any reduction in price, although, after careful examination of the vineyards, an abundant vintage is expected. There is an active demand for wine at Beziers and Pezenas, but stocks are low. Prices vary from 250f. to 40Pf. the cask of 700 litres. Spirits of wine from beetroot are quoted in Patis at 125f. the hectolitre.

ing article in defence of the policy of Austria towards Sardinia, and a brief summary of it must be given, as the paper in question is in comexzion with the Foreign-office. The Post begins by observing that the Sardinians in this empire will require no other protection than that which is accorded by the Imnperal Government to aU foreigners, "as the difference between Austria and Sardinia is a political, and not a national one." Austria has no dislike to the vigorous and gifted race that lives to the west of Lombardy; her quarrel is with the Sardinian Government, which has long disloyally and perfidiously endeavoured to undermine (untemiwihlen) the neighbouring States. In true Pharisaic spirit the Vienna writer spsaks of the behaviour of the press of this country. The Austrian papers, we are told, never soiled (besutdete) the honour and reputation of the Sardinian army, nor offended the dignity of King Victor Emmanuel, although they felt no sympathy for that Monarch. The right of Ei;ngland and France to interfere between Austria and Sardinia is denied, "every great Power being able to juldge for itself what line of conduct is most conformable to its interests and dignity." The enemies of Austria affirm that Sardinia acquired a claim to the friendship of the Western Powers by the services which she rendered them in the Crimea, but they find it convenient to forget that the concentration of Austrian troops in Gallicia and the Bukovina forced Russia to keep a whole army ready for action in the kingdom of Poland.
As theforegoing is an arpartestatement,it isrequisite to make one or two remarks on it. The Austrian press is not so unoffending as it would fain endeavour to appear, a-nd it would not be difficult to find fierce and even coarse attacks on the King of Sardinia, on the Emperor of the French, and oxn the late Emperor of Russia, in numbers of Austri papers which have appeared during the last few years. In an article which I well recollect although it was published long ago, it was said that His Majesty Victor Emmanuel was more like a mountebank than like a monarch. By occupying the Danubian Principalities, and by concentrating an army on the Polish frontier, Austria rendered excellent service to her allies, but in June, 1855, she suddenly placed the 3d and 4th armies on a peace footing, and byso doing enabled the Russian Government to send the Grenadier Corps to the Crimea.
Intelligence has been received from Venioe which entirely confirms a rumour, of which slight mention w as made in my letter of yesterday. At half-past 4 on the 23d inst. the Archduke Governor-General arrived at Venice, where he was coolly received. One reason why but few pesons were assembled to receive his Imperial Eighness was, that the higher classes at Venice were at dinner when he arrived; and another, that the 23d was the anniversary of the battle, of Novara. Early in the morning of the 24th there was little or no wind, and consequently the Austrian standard, which is at the top of the immense mast that is planted in the Place of St. Mark, hung listlessly down; but as the sum got higher the wind freshened, and the flag began to wave majestically to and fro. Gradually a crowd assembles in the Place of St. Mark, and stares with might and main at something which is fluttering just above the Imperial standard. What is the object that attracts such attention, and induces the Venetian badauds to bid defiance to rain and wind? It is the Italian tricolour, which has been attached to the uapper part of the Austrian standard during the night. When the authorities arrived on the spot, and orders were given to lower the fLag, they could not be immediately executed, because the halliards had been removed. During the night between the 23d and 24th three tricolours were hoisted; one was on the Place of St. Mark, another on the flagstaff which is in the Arsenal, and a third was affixed to the top of a sentrybox. There are persons who suspect the police or the military authorities of having hoisted the revolutionary flag in order to serve some particular purpose, but those who best know the Italians are least inclined to doubt that they were the authors of the paltry insult which was offered to the Austrian standard. There was the usual official illuniination of the Place of St. Mark in the evening of the 23d. In a fortnight or three weeks the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian will remove from Venice to Milan. It is very generally stated that the Austrian Government has resolved to defer the construction of the railroad between Milan and the Austrian frontier near Novara, but it is difficult to believe that the rulers over 39,000,000 of souls can intend to take such a petty revenge. Austria justly conuiders herself one of the first of European Powers, but unfortunately for her own reputation she somietimes acts as if she were one of the loast. Aftergrantinga general amnesty and abolishing her vexcatious and most injudiciouspassportsysteinA ustriaearnnota,ffora tospite Sardinia by refusing to complete the line of railroad to the frontier. There have been several Cabinet Councils held here lately, and it is believed Hungarian matters have been discussed at more than one of them. A person -who is capable of giving correct information on such a delicate subject assures me that the Emperor has declared that no " principiel" changes can be made in the organiza. tion of Hungary. In a word, the unity of the empire will bo strictly maintained, but everything will be done to improve the administration of the different Crqwn lands, and to satisfy the "legitimate" wishes of the inhabitants. The Cr&lit Bank has established a branch bank at Pesth, and will advance money at 5 per cent. on the produce of the soil.
Since his return here, the Emperor has expressed his resolve to enlarge the inner city.
PRUSSIA.
(FROM OUR OWN cOauxOrNuiN.)
BERLINw, MAROE 29.
The commission appointed in each House of the Diet here has already brought up its report on the Sound Dues Treaty, and both of them unanimously recommend the House to adopt it for ratification. This will doubtless take place tomorrow, as the subject is already on the lhst of the business for that day. Prussia will pay her quota in 40 half-yearly payments of 12l,731f thalers each (l8,2G0l.), retainiing to herself the rioht at any future time it may be convenient to pay up the remaining instalments in advance; the first payments will amount, with interest on the outstanding balance, to about 240,000 thalers each. Small as this half-yearly sum is, compared to the advantagesgained for Prussia by the abolition of the Sound Dues, the revenues of the State will not be burdened by an addition of more than three-fifths of it, or about 144,000 thalers yearly, inasmuch as the State has always been in the habit of allowing its own subjects a drawback of 2% per cent. to be deducted from all import duties in the Baltic ports, as a sort of palliation of the burden of the Sound Dues, and has also paid on salt alone, of which it has the monopoly, on an average of the lat 11 years 11,000 thalers a-year for Sound Dues; these two suns of 11,000 duty on salt and 85,000 drawback on import duties must therefore be first deducted from the 240,000 thalers before one can appreciate the extra burden which the redemption of the Sound Dues imposes on the revenue, and that too only for 20 years
I mentioned some time back that this Ministry
was left in a mainority on the subject of the proposed new law of divorce, the day after our own Ministers found themselves in a similar position on the Chinese affair. The Prussian Ministry, however, had another defeat on Friday, when one of its most important financial projects,
-that for a new duty on all houses and buildings,-was rejected by the large majority of 241
against 73. This defeat by no means finds an equivalent in a success it gained yesterday, viz., in pass-
ing its bill for raisng the duty on salt from 12 thalera per cask of 4 cwt. to 15 thalers, at which it formerly stood, for not only was the favourable majority in this latter case very small, viz., only 14, while tbe adverse majority inthe other case was 168, but also the increase of the duty on salt is very unpopular here. The debates in the two Houmes of the Diet have gained considerably in interest of late, for those who take any interest at all in Prassia
from the circumstane that the necessity of remedy-
ing two evils, the ineffectiveness of the army and the wretched pay of the civil officias, has driven the Government to seek for increae revenue by the introduction of new taxes, and thus stirred the Houses and the nation out of their political apathy, which they gloss over in general with the ptrnslatable euphemism of Gmthlichkei.

Tuesday Evening.
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per miMle premium, and the short exchange on London Is 2D.25 per l1. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. OAd. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-lOths per cent, dearer ill Paris than in LJondon.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is l3.SI per 1:. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 6-10hs per cent. dearer in Eamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 08B per went., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exohange is against England; but, after maldng allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The English funds have been firm to-day, and have closed at an improvement of an eighth. Consols for money opened at 93i to i, and soon advanced to 931 to i, at which they steadily rerained till the termiination of business, although a sale was effected of 100,0001. stock for delivery. For the 8th of April the last price was 93; to ;, and for the new account in May it was 94 to B. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to J; India bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequerbills (Mach), par to 3s. preimium.
The demand for money in the Stock-Exchange to-day in connexion with the settlement in foreign stocks was scarcely so great as had been anticipated. In the discount-market and at the Bank the tranactions were very large.
About 125,0001. of bar gold was taken from the Bank to-day. It is believed also that a large nunmber of sovereigns have just been withdrawn for shipment to the Cape and to Brazil. The Government likewise at this perlod usually take a considerable quantity for the payment of salaries, &c. Hence there is no inmmediate prospect of lower rates in the money-market. Indeed, unless some arrival soon occur from Australia suffciently heavy for a portion of them to be retained, the contingency of an advance in the Bank terms may again have to be taken into consideration. The payment of the dividends has already been so far anticipated by the sums borrowed from that establishment that any relaxation they may produce can be but slight and temporary.
Foreign securities exhibited little fluctuation, but prices were rather firmer at the close. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions were at 971 and i for money, and 981, 98, and 981 for the account. The Four per Cents. guaranteed for the account were negotiated at 101k and J. The other operations comprised-Brazilan Five per Cents., 102%; Buenos Ayres,185; Mexican, for money, 22 ; for the account, 23&; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., Small, 98; Sardinian Five per Cents., for the account, 91k; and Spanish Passive, 5£.
In theforeign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon HIamburg was a shade lower. With regard to other places there was ne alteration from last post.
The final quctation of the French Three per C)ents. on the Paris Bou3se this evening was 70f. SOc. both for money and the present account, showing in the former case an improvement of nearly a quarter per cent.
The Bank of Belgium has reduced its rate of discount from 4 per cent., at which it had stood since the 30th of September last, to 3i per cent.
The rate of discount at Hamburg has risen to 7 per cent., owing, it is believed, to continued purohases of silver for the Bank of Vienna.
The following extract of a letter from Liverpool, dated yesterday, in relation to the transmission of silver from Mexico, has been posted at Iloyds'
" A conducts left the city of Mexico on the 23d of Febrm. ary for Vera Cruz with $2,300,000. The waggons being heavily laden, it is doubtful if it can reach Vera Cruz in tine for the steamer of the 4th of March. The export duty on silver coin in Mexico will be raised from the present rate of 31 to 6 per cent. on the 20th of May next."
Subjoined is a table of the flactuations in the stock and share markets during the past3month. The range of Consels has been limited to 1 per cent., and the price at the close is precisely the same as it was at the commencement. In the railway share-market also there has been great steadiness :

at a meeting of the Lnares Lead Mining Company held to-day a dividend of 5s. per share was declared, and the report was agreed to. The profits for the six months ending December were only 5,2551., the fall in the value of lead, and the high prices of wages, provisions, and fuel having increased the expenditure. The progress of operations in other respects is satisfactory, and the returns of ore are fully supported. According to the accouints the available balance is 8,8971., and as this amount will be nearly absorbed by the present distribution t.he proposed arrangement for quarterly dividends wfill be intezrrupted.

MDMLAN aREAT WEPI'FRN
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held last week a Dablin; M£r. J. Ennis in the chair.
The Secretuyi read the report, an abstract of which hiz appeared in T Time,.
The C Nm , in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the proprietors on the progressive prosperity of tbe company. 'he gross receipts showed an increase of 15,7001. oyer those of the corresponding period of the prevous year. The board had proposed to recommend the moderate, ht yet handsome, dividend of 5 per cent., free of income-tax h The principle laid down in the accounts was to charge to revenue 5 per cent, per annulm on the cost of the rolling stock for a depreciation fand. The directors proposed that, instead of ;permitting the GreA Southern and Western to form a jonction with the M1idland Great Western line at Athlone, and thereby creating a coMpeting line between that town and the metropolis, to effect the junction in a manner that would afford the pabEc all the accommodation to be derived from such a step, yet in a method consistent with the safety and interests of the Midland Company. He thought the time had gone by whenP eveni the public would approve opposition betweexn railway companies, because it generally ended in coombination, and the public at the end of the coiitest were worse off than they were at the outset. He believed the result of the contest now pending would be to rectify the existing differences, and also to proteot the interests of that company and of the piblic, by giving them the junction at Streamstown. He thought they were justified in aasuminM from the state of the accounts that the Grand Canal woul be no longer a source of loss to them, but would under energetic manageencnt become a source of profit. The proposedexten. sionfroma Longfordlto Sligo was not entering upons%ny new ground, but was a legitimate extension of their own undertabing. With regard to another matter, the directors had done everythiny in their power to discover the ppetrator of the murder m theirofface. Ee (the chairmn) had spared no expense or personal labour for that purpose. The bord had contributed a sum of 2001. in alleviation of the sufferings and bereavement of mr. Little's nother, as they had no doubt the shareholders would sanction that expenditure. After some further observations, he concluded by moving the adoption of the report.
Mr. J. BOYCE seconded the motion.
A long discussion ensued, in the course of which projects for railways from Atheury to Tuam, Athlone to Castlereagh, and the Streamstown extension were alluded to, after wbich the zeport was adopted, and the dividend, at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, was declared.
Mlr.&uTsxr1 proposed that the eompany should contribute 500. in addition to the 201.swhich they had already subecribed to the family of the late Mr. Little, and whicb, added to the Dablin subscriptionL of 1,1001., would provide anancome of 90L. a-year. He contended that as lr. ILittle had bee; murdered while in the discharge of his duty to the company his family had the same clani on the company as if he had been run over by on,. of teir enie.I onfirmation of that view he stated t hatS-irO. . ney weo had lkndly undertaken to receive subscrtions i Ono had informed him by letter that double the amount heha
enclosed would obtained had it rot been that many nersons refused to subscribe on the ground that the company was boundtto make the necessary provision.
3Mr. MALnzY seconded the motion.
The C E{Arn explained that the motion could not be entertained, as the proper notice had not been given, but he had no objection to bring the subject forward at the next meetimg
T'he proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the
IRISH SOUTE[-FASTER.
The half-early meeting of this company was held on Saturday at I)ublin, and the report (an abstract of which has appeared in The Times) was adopted
In reply to questions it was stated that the works on the Bagenalatown and Weeford line wereprogressng favourably, and it was expected that the line would be completed in about 12 months. The income of the South-Easteru Company would be increased by 600h in 1858 and by a further sum of 6001. in 1859, under the agreement with the Great Southern and Western Company. The opening of the Baenalstown line would tend to merease the tra0c, and when it;paid a dividend the rish South-Eastern Company would also receive a dividend ou their subscription towtards the construction of that line.
The dividend, at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, recommuended inthe report was declared, and the meeting separated.

The railway-market was again buoyant, and, the account having terminated in a satisfactory manner, prices generally exhibited tirmness. English shares advanced from 6s. to I's. per share; foreign and colonial were again better, a large business having been transacted in French and Grand Trunk of Canada. The pressure for money has rather diminished, the demand subsiding in the later hours. Joint-stock bank shares continue heavy, but the operationg were not important.

MANCHESTER, TUESDAY.
AU kinds of goods and yarns are firmer in price. More business has been transacted in cloths suitable to India and China, and if the intelligence should be confirmed that affairs have been brought to an amicable settlement in China there will, no doubt, be a very extensive demand for the fabrics suitable to that market. In domestics there is a steady business, sufficient to absorb the production, but not to produce an improvement in values. In yarns there has been a very large business, as reported by some houses, but principaUy for Germsany, and in many instances Ad. per lb. has been added to last quotations, especially for water-twist ranging between numbers 16 to 24. Yarns for manufacturing purposes, sold to the home trade, have also Cne off well at the advance. For India yarns there has
enmore inquiry, and, though it has not led to much business, prices are fimer. A fair business is reported, in fact, generally, both for home aml shipping purposes.
Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:-
*There his been raither eovre enqy yesterday end to-day for Iia and Chnta goods, and a iittle speculative business bnha been dons f
tbe latter cn rket in anticipaton of the accounts by the mai non. near at hand. In other respects there is no change to notice, the nnarket continuing in the same inanimate condition as reported for the last week or teO; hut do far there are no acumtuations of stockst and consequently nochangeinprices." I
NOTTINGHAC T , TUESDAY.
There is an improvement in the home de.mand for lace and many houseos are busy; and still further improvement will take place with the setting in of sprine weather. The demand continues for plain goods, and this branch has been for a considerable time past one of the most profitable connected with our trade. In fancy laces and' silks there is rather more doing, and there are prognostications of a better demand shortly.
The hosiery trade is in a very matisfactory state beth as respects the home and foreign demand. iaterial is, however, very dear.
LEICESTE3B, TUESDAY.
There is not mu;ch improvement in trade. AIanufacturers
are, however, looking forwaerd to a better demand. Miost branches are healthy, and stocks on hand are light.
LEEDS, TUESDAY.
Compared with Saturday there has been a better market this morning, and the transactions have been to an average extent. The tone of the trade is assuming a more settled character, and there are no reasons for doubting that the dulless occasioned by elec tioneering excitement w,ill be followed by a beneficial reaction.
HUJDDERSFIELD, TUES;DAY.
The cloth-market was flat this morning, and only a limsited business was transaoted in all descriptions of goods.
Insolvent Debtors' Court, March 31.
IPTSOLVENT DBBTORS' COUPT, Mcarch 3L
TRE HE2NRY WILTON.
(Before Mr. ComrMiMiOfetr ItURHY.
'ns isolvent, an attorney, was opposed by several persons who were creditors for costs which they had incurred in defending themselves from proceedings in Chancery, which he had instituted, as they alleged, without justification.
The case had been before the Court previously, when the learned Commisioner recommended the insolvent to give an undertaking not to commenee fresh litigation, but the insolvent declined to assent to the proposition.
A complaint was made of certain statements in the schedule reflecting upon the opposing creditors, and the Commissioner, considering'they were unnecessary and uncalled-for, drew his pen through them.
The learned Comamassio?xE regretted to be compelled to pass an adverse judgment upon a man of the insolvent's advanced age (upwards of 70); but, as there could be no doubt that the costs of the opposing creditors constituted a debt that had been improperly incurred, the insolvent would be discharged on the expiration of six months from the vesting order.

UMVIL UOURT.-(Before Mr. Justice CROMitoN.)
MKNGHT V. DUCKWORTH AND ANOTHER.
This was an action to recover damages for an accident to the plaintiff arising froin'the tgligence of the defendants in executing a contract for laying down somc aer ieo the Liverpodi Wsterworkisewater pipes for
Mr. Edward James, Q.C., Mr. Raffles, and mr. C.Hutton appeared for the plainti.ff, and MIr. MIonk anMr it
for the defendants. ud Mr. Manisty
It appeared that the pliintiff, who is a publicau, had been to Preston from Liverpool on the 12th of February last in a gig, with a friend named Jones, who was driving. On returning at night, as they camei to a place caled the Old Swan, they had to pass an excavation made in the high road for the purpose of laiing a6wn pipes for the Liverpool Waterworks. It was dark, and no lights were put up to warn passengers of the danger, and Mr. Jones not seeing the excavation drove the horse aud gig right into it. The plaintiff was thrown over the splashboard of the gig, received a severe cut over his'right eye, asd was so seriously bruised about the head that he became insensibie, and remained in that condition for more than a week. When removed itwas thought he was deact The defendants had contracted with the Liverpool Corpiration to do the work, and their liability was not disputed. It was, however, attempted to be proved that the plaintiff was cot sober at the time of the accident, and that a light was exhibited at the cutting, but this proof failed.
At the close of the pliIntiff's case the learned counsel on both sides conferred together, and the defendants agreed to submit to a verdict against them for 951. damages, and also to a verdict against thesis for 251. damages in a second action by the witness Jones against them for injuries he had received. g m r
It was stated that the defendants had employed a watchman, who was absent from his duty in a publichoase at the tune of the accident.
CROWN COURT.-(Before Mhr. Baron MARTIN.)
Hartley Astin was indicted for having, at Padiham, on the 19th of February last, unlawfully, malidously, and feloniously damaged certain cotton warps and various articles of machinery, with intent, &c.
Mr. Edward James,.Q.C., and Mr. Kay prosecuted, and Mr. Monk and Mr. Higgin defended the prisoner.
Mr. EDwARD .JAsS,.on opening the case for the prosecution, stated that the prisoner was a shareholder in the Padiham Cotton League Company, which had been established and dulyregistered under the Joint-Stock Companies Act of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 110, and he was indiotea under the 3d section of the 7th and 8th of George IV., cap. 30. He was charged with having on the night of the 18th of February, 1857, broken into the company's mill at Padiham, and with having cut and destroyed a great quantity of cotton warps and worsted healds and machinery, inflicting damage to the amount of nearly 3001. The prisoner had been in their employment and discharged. and was known. to entertain aninosity against the company. The learned counsel was about to call witnesses in support of the prosecution, when a
HiS LORDSEIP intesfered, and said he was clearlyof opinion that the prisoner could not be indicted under the statute of the 7th and 8th of George IV., cap. 30; the prisoner was clrly a partner in point of law, and to that extent an owner of the property, and as such not indictable under that Act.
Mr. JAMvs then suggested whether the prisoner might not be liable under the section of the Joint-Stock Com. panies Act which rendered liable shareholders of jointstock banks who had, being officers of the company, emnbezzled the property of the company.
His LoRDsBp, however, said,-I am clearly of opinion that the Joint-Stock Companies Act gives no authority for this indictment. In the case of joint-stock banks there is certainly a special enactment as to embezzlement, &c., that arose from a breach of contract, but in this case no such provision applied to the prisoner, nor could he be found guilty of an unlawful act in destroying property of which he was himself part-owner. Had this company been regiscered under the late Act, the 19th and 20th of Victoria, the defence as to part-ownership. ould have fallen to the ground; and in due time all companies would come under the recent A ct. the prisoner must be discharged.
In the case of John Lewis, the Anerican boatswain, who was found guilty on Saturday of the manslaughter of the German boy " George,"
His LORDSHeP, having directed the prisoner to be brought up, told him that upon consideration he should direct the sentence he had passed to be withdrawu, and that the prisoner must remain in custody until the decision of the Criminal Court of AppeaLwas known. If that Court decided that the verdict could not stand the prisoner would be discharged. If they decided the other way sentence would be passed upon him by the judge who would come here in the summer.
ERA&Tvu3L-In the report from this circuit yesterday the name of Mr. Edward James, Q.C., of this circuit, is, by some error, changed into that-of Mr. Edwin James, Q.C. The latter gentleman is one of the leaders of the Home Circuit; Mr. Edwaxd James is one of the leaders of the Northern Circuit.
TUESDAY, MARCH 31.
This morning Mr. Justice Crompton commenced trying the special jury causes, and was occupied the greater part of the day with the trial of a cause arising out of some banktuptoy proceedim in its character wholly uninteresting.
Kr. Baron Martin sat for the trial of prisoners in the early part of the day, and then tried common jury causes, Mr. Bliss, Q.C., sitting in the magistrates' room for the trial of prisoners.
CROWN CouaRT.-(Before Mr. Baron MAxR .)
Samuel Bevington and Wiliam Cornett were indicted for forgery.
Mr. Brett prosecuted, and Mr. Simon defended the prisofiers.
From the statement of the learned counsel it appeared '.hat the prisoners had forged the mark of a person named M'Mulen to a note of the Liverpool Adelphi Loan Company for 51. The facts of the case having been clearly proved,
Mr. SIMoN, upon the part of the prisoners, endeavoured to show that they had received some sort of authority from M'Mullen, which went to negative the felonious intent; but -
His LORDSTnP stopped the case, stating that he considered the intent to defraud clearly proved.
The jury thereupon, by direction of his Lordship, found both prisoners Guilty; and, in passing sentence,
The learned JUDGE said,-The evidence against you has satisfied my mind beyond aU doubt that you are both guilty of the crime of forgery; and you are probably aware that formerly the law of this country made such an offence punishable with death, and hundreds of persons have been executed in past times for this very offence; but of late years the Legislature has taken a more humane view, and very materially reduced theSpunishment. But I wish you and all persons to know that it isa most dangerous thing to write axnother man's name waithout his distinct authority, and the~ jud¢,s have determined to punisht all pers6sis who are found so offending with great severity. I have conferred with Mr. Justice Crompton, and he entirely coincides -with-mke in thinking that the intent is clearly proven by thne very act of writing the name or mark of" another person, where a man does it knowing well what he is about. If it were not so, business could never be carried on, especially banldng business. I regard it as a double fraud. You defraud firsb the man of womn you borrow the money, and you defraud the man whose name and credit are imperiUed by your aot. I have considered the matter very much. In this instance I am quite satisfied of your legal guilt; but there may be some consideration for you as to your moral guilt. The distinction in this offence between legal and moral guilt may be exemplified by the instance of legal malice as ilustrated in the difference between murder and manslaughter; and, as you have been in prison some time, I shall sentence you each to three months' imprisonment and hard labour.
is LORDssip, on passing sentence to-day upon various prisoners fouad guilty of garotte robberies, said,-I am determined to do my utmost to put down this system of highway robbery, which I am sorry to find very much upon the increise in Manchester and LiverpooL It is perfectly monstrous that persons should be liable to be violently assaulted in the way they are, and half-strangled and robbed. I repeat, it must and shall be put a stop to, and, if the punishment I am about to give you proves insufficent, depend upon it that the judge who comes here in the summer will make the punishment of this offence much heavier. People passing through the street are entitled to the protection of the law, and have a right to go about. their lawful business in safety, either by day or night. His Lordship then sentenced 29 Drisoners to various terms of penal servitude, from four to six years. He added, he was glad to find a diminution in the number of burglary cases.

After a great deal of evidence had been given in support of the case, the prisoner w,as committed for trial.
Thomas Foster Barton, clerk in the service of Messrs. Ingram, Travers, and Co., wholesale grocers in St. Swithin'slane, was charged with embezzling the moneys of his employers.
Mr. W. T. Wilson, a customer of the proseautors, said that on the 4th of August he paid the prisoner 201. on their account, and took from him the receipt produced.
Mr. J. Mossop, cashier to the prosecutors, proved that the prisoner had not accounted to the firm for the 201.
The prisoner, who reservea his defence, was fully committed for.trhsdec wsflci
Y_AnLBOROUGM-STEET.-James William Hitchins, Richard Baker, Daniel. Causdell, George King, and William Coles were brought before Mr. BEADON, charged with being found in a betting-office, No. 2, Rupert-street.
Mr. Lewis appeared for-the defendants.
The superintendent of the C division, Mr. Hannant, produced his authority from the Police Commissioners for entering the. house No. 2, Rupert-street. He went there about 8 o'clock the previous evening and announced who he was to the defendant Hitchin, who was standing at the door of an inner room. Witness found in one of the rooms a tquantity.of betting cards relating to races to come off. The defendants King and Coles were looking at some cards on a shelf. They and the cards were taken possession of by the poliee. The defendant Baker, who was present, said he hopedthe police would not take him to the station-house, ashe could prove he was arespectable tradesman, and didnot intend to disguise the purpose he came to the place for. He told the defendants they must go to thestation-house, but the defendants remonstrated, and, did not acquiesce until told he had no alternative. A tin box was found, which was claimed by Hitchins, vho had the key. The contests of the box were letters relating to bets. The shop was fitted up as a house agent's-office.
Mr. Lewis said the only c4arge against all-the defendants, exqept Hitchios, was that they were in the house.
Mr. BEA,DON said they.came within the operation of the
Act, the #hop being, as alleged, a place used for purpose of betting.
hlspecter Ietter, O division, assdsted in taking the defendants into custody. Causdell he found behind a deskso waH Hitchins. The others were in the shop, apparently engaged in exsanining -some -betting lists. On Hitchins he found 481. in gold and notes, and two books relating to races.
A witness named Gower said he had been to the shop several times, and had only seen Canudell and Hitchins there. On. riday.witness made a bet at the. shop on the Chester Cup with Causdell, and Hitchins entered the bet of a crown in a book,. but.did not give him any mom - randum. He then went to the superintendent, of the division and gave information of the bet.
On cross-examination witness adnitted that he had been on the Medical Staff Corps at Chathama, and had been sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment for being,dri Had gone into the house first, beheving it was a house-asent%, and had not previously communicated with the police.
Mr. Lewis contended there was no case against any of the parties, as the proof of betting rested on the evidence of a witneEssunworthy of belief.
fr. .Bwionvwent carefullyover the evidence andconcluded by discharging Baker, ling, and Coles, and fining Causdell 101. or one month, and ltitchins 201. or two months' hard labour.
George Matkin, John Richards, Mark Kelsey, James Lee, Thomas Cardina .John.,Charles Smith, and James Dup)ree were charged with being found in a house used for bettingpurposes...
The usual authority having been produced, Superintendent Hannant si went last night to the Horse and Groompublichousem George.yard, Grosvenor-square, kept by the defendant MAtkin,. and having ordered the outer door to be secured, he found Matkin and Richards behind the bar, and the rest of the defendantsin front of the bar. The defendant Iatkin, on learning his business. said therewas no betting-it was not .a betting-office. Witness found a small book on a table in a room behind the bar, which proved to be a betting ledger. The other defendants declared they had come into the, house to have something to drink, and not to bet. In the betting ledger the name of Lee was entered. Defendant Matkin said the b2ok belonged td a former landlord. In the book was a, card referring to the Derby race of this year. Saw nothing in the shapeof money, as if betting had been going on.
Inspector Webb produced several books relating tors, which he found in. the house; also a book with cards referring to various races, and the odds on the different horses. Pound an entry of 61. of a bet made by a better named Lee. In the posscesioyn of Matkin was 601. or Oby701.
A witness na}nre&raser proved that he made a bet with Matkin on a horse race, and saw betting going on at the timne; alsom3ade a bet on the. Metropolitan Stackes, which was entered in one of the books found in the defendant's
After Mr. lewis had addressed the Court,
Mr. Bn.ADoN fined Matkin 301., or three months' hard labour, and discharged the other. defendants.

WESTsTER.-Maria Jones, a powerful and masculinelooking woman, was chstged with the following highway robbery:-
Edward Carnel6y, a miller, living in Broad-street, Cityroad, said that he was going horme through Victoria-street, Westminster, at about lir at night, when the prisoner came up and seized him. He shook her off; when she importuned him to see her home, and; although he repulsed her in every possibleway, she followedhimtotheBroad Sanctuary, where she suddenly seized his watch, broke it with violence from the guard chain, and attempted to make of£ He prevented her doing so, in the course of which she bit his arm through.
Carr, 206 B, saId he took the prisoner into custody. She denied the charge; but on her way to the station-house she called some prostitutes from the other side of the way, aned attempted to give them the watch, which he seized.
The prisoner's only reply to the chargo was that she was Mr. PAxvTxn committed her for trial for highway robbery at the Central Criminal Court.
WORSEBP-STEET.-Tames Fowler, Selina Phillips, and Sarah Usher, the former well known for years past as an utterer of base money, were charged before Mr. D'ErNCOURTT with coning.
Information to the above effect having been given to Inspector Brennan, lately attached to the G Division, but now in the employment of t4e Mint, he, accompanied by Inspector Bryant, Sergeant Evans, and other officers, on the afternoon of Friday last went to a small cottage at the back of the Whitechapel-road, and finding the front door securely fastened burst it in with a sledge hammer. On entering they found the three prisoners, the man in his shirt sleeves, all sitting before a large fire, from which Phillips snatched a plaster of Paris mould for casting florms and flung it upon the floor. Fowler instantly made a staip at it and parly crushed it with his heel, but was seized by Bryant, whom he atteked in the most outrageous manner, grasping him by the hair, and striking and kicking him violently, and it was only by the combined efforts of several of the officers thaat he wsis at last overpowered, flung upon a bed; and handcaffed. The woman Phillips in the meantime succeeded in obtaiing the mould, but had it wrenched from her, and she and Usher having been also secured, after as stout a resistance as two women could offer to several men, the constables proceeded to search the prisoners and the place, and on the dresser found a galvanic
attery, with eleven counterfeit shillings in the coils of the wire, undergoing the process of elating from a good simpence suspen ed in the jar, beside w'ch were seven more shillings finished for circuiatio0A beneath the bed were a ladle filled with white metal and f'les with their teeth clogged with it, while in other parts of the place were acids, sand, metal, and every requisite for carrying on false coining upon avery extensive scale. In addition to these Bryant produced four counterfeit shillings, Evans ten, Sergeant Brennan five, wrapped up inpaper for sale, and Elliott, another officer, four, all dated 1816, besides a good shillng found upon Fowler, upon which the corrosive action of the acid was distinctly visible, showing it had been used for coating spurious pieces. The conacta of Fowler was described by the officers as being both outrageous and cowardly, and one of them said that during 2 years' experience he had never met a more desperate charaoter,
All the prisoners reserved their defence, and they were fully committed for ,iaJl

TRE PTBLIO HEALTH.
(From the llegis General's WeeklyReturn.)
The total number of deathsregistered in London in the week that ended on Saturday was 1,248. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,318. But the deaths of last week occurred in an increased popnlation, and to admit of comparison the average just given should be raised in proportion to the increase, and in this case it will become 1,450. The number now returned is less by 202 than the corrected average.
The births registered last week exceed the deaths by 689. The increase, not very great, in the return of deaths registered last week over those of some previous weeks, is not due to a higher rate of mortality, hut to more than the just weekly proportion of deaths returned by coroners being placed on the registers, which is a usual occurrence at the end of a quater.
Fatal cases of the disees which form the zymotic class exhibit a decrease from.197 in the preceding week to 187 last week. The corrected average for corresponding weeks is 25L?Whoopingcough, as usually happens at this period of the year, is the most fatal of this description of diseases, and numbers 60, the average being 63. Measles, to which 20 cases are referred, is also about the average; while scarlatina, which caused .20 deaths, typhus, and common fever, which caused 34, and smallpox, which was only fatal to three children, are all decidedly below the average. No deaths from smallpox occurred in the Western, Eastern, or Southern districts. Taking all the five zymotic diseases which have now been specified together, only four deaths from them occurred in East and West London and the city; none in the Strand district or in St. George-in-the-East; only one in St. Saviour, Southvark ;none in St. Olave; two in Wandsworth; one in Lewisham. It does not appear, however, that the weather bas lately been very favourable to persons subject to bronchial affections; 164 persons died in the previous week from bronchitis, and 160 last week, the average being 125. The mean weekly temperature which in the second week of March fell to 37 2deg., and rose in the subsequent week to 45-1 deg., fell again last week to 39-6 deg. On the 18th the mean temperature was 11 deg. above the average; on the 22dit was 9 deg. below it.
Three persons who had attained the age of 90 years or upwards are recorded inthis return. The oldest is a gentleman who died at Bow, at the age of 95 years.
Last weekthe births of 990 boys and 947 girls-in all 1,937 children-were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,700.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-625 in. The highest reading in the week occurred on Friday, and was 29-90 in. The mean temperature of the week was 39-6 deg., which is 2-5 deg. below thg average of. the same week in 43 years. The mean daily temperature was below the average on the seven days from the 21st to the 27th inclusive. 'the highest temperature occurred on Saturday, and was 54 deg.; the lowest occurred on Sanday (the 22d) and was 27- deg. The range of the week was therefore 26 3 deg. The thermometer fell on four nights below, freezing point. The mean dew point temperature was 34 3 deg., and the difference between this and the mean tempeature of the air was 5-3deg On Sunday the wind was in the north-west; afterwards its direction was for the most part south-west and south-east. The air was latterly calm. There was hardly any rain. Some snow fell onthe first two days.
ThE L&TE GAms.-During the late gales a large number of vesslshave sought -the shelter of the new harbour at Holyhbad, al of which ran in in perfect safety. Fragments of some wreck have since come ashore at varions points. A narow escape ocurred during the height of the gale at Rhyl, when a large American vessel got narIy aground on the flats. So close was she that many deeChd she was actually fast The crew out away the main and migen masts, and, after arduous exertions, they succeed in worldiig her out with what sails she could bear on the forematt, all of which. were in ribands. It was an exciting spectacle, the gale being tremendous, and the vessel in the most imminent peril, so that her escape was indeed pro'videntiaL . . .

Maidstone Election.
MAIDSTOIY:E ELECTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I observe in The Times of this morning, with reference to the return of Captain Scott and myself for the borough of Midstone, the following statement :-" There is not the slightest doubt that there will be a petition, the grossest corruption having prevailed throughout the contest."
In answe'r to that statement I have raerely to say, that throughout the contest it has been my earnest, strongly and often expressed desire that the election should be a pure one. My committee have as strongly reciprocated this desire, and have repeatedly assured me that nothing partaking of the nature of corrapt influence or practices has taken place on their part. All that I have myself seen and heard conduces to my belief in the strict accuracy of their assurances, and, for myself, I am utterly ignorant of any corrupt practices whatever, and have never sanctioned either directly or indirectly, anything of the kind. In confirmation I beg to observe that the promises freely, frankly, and readily given on our canvass correspond exactly with the votes tendered at the polling-booths. So satisfied am I of the truth and sincerity of the representations of my friends, and of my own rectitude during the election, that I shall be prepared and ready to defend my seat against any petition which a defeated and angry party may have the daring to present against me; and, although without communication with him, I venture to hazard the same assurance on behalf of my colleague, Captain Scott. This I feel due to the honourable and unbought support of the constituency whose representative I am proud to call myself.
With reference to another charge contained in your paper of Monday, the 30th inst., that " there was a great amount of drunkenness and numerous personal collisions," I have merely to observe that the Mayor took occasion at the declaration of the poll to state that there was not a single charge on the police-sheet arising out of the election, and he complimented the inhabitante of Mfaidstone on a contest so unusually quiet and orderly. This statemaent was fully confirmed by the head of the police.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant.

The Return For Bury.
THB BETURN FOR BURY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I see that in your comments upon the elections, and also in your analysis of Ministerial gains and losses, you treat the return of Mr. Philips as a " casualty" in respeot of the Government, and you classify him under the head of "Conservative."
When I tell you that Mr. Philips is a son of the late Mr. Robert Plhilips, of the Park, near Manchester, and the brother of Mr. Mark Philips, who so long represented hIanchester, and who might have retained that position up to the present time had he chosen so to do, you wilU form some idea of the stock from which ousr present member springs.
The truth is, that Mr. F. Peel was the representative, not of the town and people of Bory. but of a "coalition" numerically small, but very powerful in point of wealth and influence, composed of all the Tories or Conservatives in the place and a smal section of the Liberals who, in 1852, took the town by surprise and possessed themsel7es of the representation. Mr. RPoiert Needham Philips is returned by the Liberal interest, I may say by the whole town, on what you would designate "advanced" Liberal principles. He goes into Plarliament unfettered byany trammels as to supporting this or that Government, and whilo he vill give to Lord Palnerston or any other Mini-ter, where the interests, dignity, or honour of the country are in danger, an earnest support, he is essentially an independent member, prepared to act against any Government which refuses (as in the case of Lord Palmerston upon Mr. Lock King's motion) to concede those progressive reforms which are essential to a true representation of the people.
The electors and inhabitants of Bury have adopted a course, which, I trust, will be followed by all the Lancashire borougha,,and all popular constituencies,-in determbiing not to allow their borough to be imade the sport of Ministerial tactics. They say that a town vith 30,000 inhabitants ought not to be a pocket borough in support of Government, in utter disregard of the opinions of the con. stituency upon the great ouestions that come before Parliament. They consider that in permitting these popular constituencies to be absorbed by Ministerial candidates, so far from adding force to the opinions of the people, its direct tendency is to smother their voice, and to deprive the House of Commons of that liberal and independent element so essential to force on those measures of reform, political and administrative, which the country has a rightto expect, but which no Government seems disposed voluntarily to initiate.
I have thought it necessary thus briefly to explain the motives which have actuated this constituency in substituting Mr. Philips for Mr. Peel; they are actuated by no personal disrespect to the latter, but they prefer to be represented by agentleman who can take an independent position, whose political opinions are in harmony with their own, and who, from his residence among them, and his kinIdred pursruts as a British merchant, may be naturally sup|posed to sympathize with them in all that affect,s the coin. mnercial prosperity of the country at large.
II am, Sir, Your obedient servant.

By telegraph from MarseiDles we learn that the Jura, which sailed from Southampton on the 12th 'with the Australian mails, arrived at Malta on the 21st.
The Cambria, from Marseilles, with the mails for Ceylon and Australia sent vid France, arrived at Malta the same day as the Jura, and transferred her mails to that vessel up to the 23d inst.
There was no news from Suez at Alexandria of the Oneida, with the first inward mail from Aistralia and Ceylon, due at Alexandria on the 8th, the contract day for sailing for England.
The Cunard screw steamship Etna was at Alexandria on the 23d, where she had been since the 7th, waiting for the arrival of the Oneida.
The Australian Auxiliary Screw Clipper Company's mail steamship King Philip was off Plymouth Sound yesterday (Tuesday) evening, bound for Melbourne. She cannot leave Plymouth before this (Wednesday) evening, and will probably be detained until the arrival of the London mail tomorrow (Thursday) morning.
To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMfES.
Sir,-I observe that Mr. Arthur Gordon, the nnccessfuI candidate atLiskeard, impugns the accuracy of the definition of his principles which was contained in 27W Times of the 26th inst.
Mr. Gordon's principles are so chameleon-like that he has, I dare say, already changed them, and it is very possible he may at this moment consider himself a "Liberal Conservative," althongh in the same sentence he expresses a concurrence of opinion with the political professions of Lord J. Russell in the city.
Lord J. Russell, however, most strongly expressed his opposition to the ballot, of which Mr. Gordon has declared himself a warm supporter; and Lord J. Russell is also well known to have voted and spoken against the abolition of church-rates, the extinction of which figures as a leading topic in Mr. Gordon's addressto the electors of Liskeard.
It is but just to him to add that the " Ecclesiastical establishments in Ireland!' find no greater favour in his eyes. The main feature of the Chartist creed is "Universal Suffrage," and Mr. Gordon approximates very closely to this cardinal point of the "Charter" when he declared atLiskeardthat "alarge extension of the suffrage was required," and that the test of qualification was to be "intelligence," not "property."
The simple truth, however, is, that Mr. Gordoa has studied well the maxim of " being all things to all men," and the advocate last week at Liskeard of " a large extension of the suErage," without reference to any propertv qualification, of vote by ballot, and of extinction of all church establishments, is now again a Liberal Conservative to any constituency in want of a gentleman of that political creed, or a Lord John Russellite to any constituency which prefers the prindples of that distinguished Reformer.

MELANCHOLY CASE.-On Monday evening an in-
MELANsOLY CAss.-On Monday eve-ning an inquest was held by Mr. J. Lister, coroner, at the Great Northern Railway Station, Doncaster, on the body of a single woman named Eliza Bolton, who had died early in the morning of the same day under the following ciroum. stances :-The deceased arrived at Doncaster from Rother. ham on Sunday morning. In the evening she went to the station for the purpose of returning to the latter place, and sat down on a bench on a platform. She complained to one of the porters that she was tired and cold, and he invited her into one of the waiting-rooms, where, however, there was no fire. Almost immediately afterwards he heard a cry of distress, and, on going to the waiting-room, in com. pany with another porter, he found the poor woman laid on the hearthrug, and evidently in great agony. It was soon apparent that she was in labour, and female assistance was procured, Mrs. h'Allister, of the refreshment rooms, rendering very prompt and timely aid until the arrival of an ex;perienced nurse and a medical man. The child was, however, born before the two latter coutld get to the station, sand the woman was removed as carefully as possible to the workhouse. Additional medical assistance was then obtained, but the deceased began to sink rapidly and after an interval of delirium, in which she frequently repeated the name of her mother, she expired shortly after 12 o'clock on Monday morning. It appears that the unfortunate young woman formerly lived in Doncaster, and had there a sweetheart, by whom she was basely deserted. It is not known how or where she spent her time on Sunday, but from her wearied and cold state on returming to the station at night she would scem to have had no place of shelter. The jury returned a verdict of "Died from collapse after confinement," and highly commended the promptitude and humanity show n by Mrs. ldIA'Allister and the railwvay officials.
RASsrvo SuNxggN VESSELS AT SEBASTOPOL.-The apparatus now in process of construction in this country to be used in raising sunken vessels in the Sebastopol harbour is larger and more complete than any heretofore em-loyed for a similar purpose. The work will be done from immense caissons of wooden floats supporting eight engines of 40-horse power, each of which drives a double action pump connecting with enormous hydraulic rams. These rams weigh 54,000 lb. a-piece, and have a lift in
power of 500 tons. They consist of nothing but a cylinder and piston, to the latter of which a chain is attached, which is also fastened to the sunken vessels. When the piston has been driven up to the cylinder head by the pressure of the condensed water the chain is kept at that point, the piston is run out again, and so by successive hitches the work is done. Four rams can be brought to bear on one vessel at a time. Gear work may also be attached to the engines, so as to derive from each of them an additional lifting power of 500 tons. Four engines and the same number of rams operating together wil therefore supply an aggregate power of 4,000 tens, wvhich ie more than iS reqired to raise the largest ship in the harbour. Of the 107 sunken vessels only 15 are equal in size to the U. S. frigate Pennsylvania, weighing in water some 3,500 tons, and the rest will average 2,000 tons. The chains now being forged at Pittsville are much larger than those spoken of bythe English papers as making for the steamships Adriatic and Great Eastern, being 100 yards in length, weighing 300 lb. to the link, and capable of sutaining a strain of 500 tons. The iron sheaths throuah which the chains will pass, and which will be placed on the timber docks, to be sent out from Philadelphia on the 15th inst.. will weigh each 26 tons. The submarine operations will bh performed by the aid of Gowan's diving bell, a contrivance never yet exhibited in thiscountry, and his armour which was used with success in the raising of the U. S steamer Missouri, in the recent extrication of a safe from the sunken boat Atlantic in Lake Erie, and on several other occasions. Mr. Gowan expects to get up at least forty of the vessels whole. The rest he will blow to pieces, the Russian Government contraeting to furnish the powder. As the greatest depth of water is only 60 feet, and the surface is smooth as a mill pond for the greater part of the year, Mr. Gowan will be able to prosecute his labour to great advantage, and hopes to complete the job within two years. He receives for his pay one half of the value of all the ships raised, as appraised by an officer of the Government and himself. The larger vessels cost some 1,100,000 dollars each, and were only a year old when snnk, so that it will be seen that Mr. Gowan has a chance to make a snug little profit on lis contract. The expense of the entire oatfit is not far from 250,000 dollars. Three vessels will be employed in transporting men, implements, &c., to the scene o action. The first will sail early in May the secord about the middle of the month, and the third at the close of it. Mr. Gowan will take out ninety men, eonsisting of divers, engineers, caulkers, ship and house carpenters, seamen; blacksmiths, and joiners. By request of the Russian Goverutnent, he will carry along some specimens of American invention and handicraft, sech as steamengines, capstans, and windlasses, of thermostimproved pttern, ploughs, corn-planMers, drawings, and models of the v. S. steam-frigates Mersio and Niagara, a fire.eniine &c. Several engineers 'will'leave for Sebastopol at sssearly daytto make the necessary surveya, construct the caissons, and hsave everything in readineasyfor the receptionJ and immediate operation of the machine5y.w.hen it arrives.-Htes Ycr15Jqwa of COm,w

RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS.-We congratulate
RESULT OF THE ELECONS.--We congMtulatdourselves, and the electors of the united kingdom generillys: on the results of the last few days. These results hav@shown beyond all doubt-first, that the people of this country are determned to support the Government which owes its existence to their approval in the pursuance oft measures necessary for their honour and welfare, and tsssuppress all factious cavilling and all opposition for opposi. tion's sake to those who are antrusted forthe time beingwitl& the destinies of England; and, secondlv, that they are na less determined to exact from the Miniser of itheir choices the prompt execution of the reforms on which they have set their heart. The fact that, so far as can b. judg from the elections hitherto held, Lord Pulmerstors
be largely indebted for his majority in the nextParliament to the more decided reformers is sufficienfi. to allay any apprehension which may have been, excited by the sneer in which the leader of the Opposition indulged concerning "the Tory chief of a RlicaI Cabinet." This being the case, we cannot see anyreason -why every exertion should not be made to secure for the Premier as large a majority as can be obtained, with X view to the more rapid and efficient despatch of publiz business. We do not see that any credit should be given to those who opDose and harass a Ministry simply as such. It is very well to talk about the necessity that the House of Commons should exercise an effective control over the ad. ministration of the national affairs. This is quite true, but it is equally true that it is not the business of the House to carrv on the Queen's Government, but to see that it is carried on upon those principles which are pro. fessed by the Ministry, and have been sanctioned by the country. It is also true that to pass a vote of censure uupom the conduct of one Administration wLan there is no possibility of replacng it by another is simply absurd; and we cannot but rejoice at the numerous defeats sustained by those who induced the House of Comnons thus to stultify itself, and more especially by those members whose political career has been apparently directed to no other end than that of making all government whatever an extreme diffi. culty, if not an impossibility. We should be sorry indeed to see the independence of the House of Commons compromised hy servile complaisance to, any Minister whatever, but this is a danger whicka is too remote for practical consideration. The great; point to be borne in mind is, that unless a Ministrj cam command an efficient working majority izrthe House of Commons the business of the nation cannot be properly done. It is to be hoped accordingly that the results of the remain. ing elections will confirm the augury to be drawn franz those which have already taken place, and will reverse for Lord Palmerston the well known phrase, describing the fate of a weak Ministry-" It is unable to carry good measuresit is compeled to carry bad."-MancheAr Guardian o yesterday.
BELGiM AND E?w,Nri.-The commercial Protectionists of Belgium have ado pted a comical way of expressing their detestation of England and free trade, in a
procession which passed through the streets of Tournay at; the Mid Lont festival last week. The English nation was personified by a huge big-bellied figure, a sort of Gargantua the Great, with vast open jaws, devouring all sorts of foodt in most unconscionable quantities, while a number of other
igures, representingthe other nationsof the world, stood by, starving. The car of Per,#de AWion was drawn through the town with much vulgar and vociferous derision, conveying Lord Mangefort, as t'e representative of our country was nick-named, who was made, every quater of an hnur, to stop and swallow a heap of victuals, bread, meat, poultry an}; rabbits, butter and cheese, and other commodities, of which. an Englishman, like the native of any other couLtry, desires to consume as much as he wants. After exhibiting this spectacle in front of the houses of several leading advocates of free trade, the mob proceeded to the river Escaut, and, with cries of "A N'eau les Ana7ais I" they predpi*atec! their awkward plaything into the 'water. The eatables however, which Lord Mangefort had left, were put by till next day, 'when they were distributed among thei workpeople of a flax mill, the owners of 'which establish. ment are said to have paid the expenses of the exhibition. The Inipxenc7ance Beige adds that they sang a song commencng " Guerre a tu Anglais I" and, together with theF workmen of three other factories, paraded the street, at S o'clock in the evening, to the music ofthe marrowbones and! cleaver, with loud threats against the English. Gin anc' beer were freely dispensed among them by some persons whooughlt tohaveknown better. TheIndepeadance expresses much regret at these uncivil and uncourteous doings, andremarks:- "Nooneexcept thosewho areshamefullyignorantof the cond7itions and interests of our country, and of the chanaes it has undergone, can pretend to deny the happy effect whiclh extensive purchases on the part of English merchants anal capitalists have had in bringing about that returning pros. perity which our Flanders has obtained, in contrast to its former state of utter prostration. The class of small far. mers, aided by English money, have rapidly acquired that; modest competence which is the general characteristic of our agriculturists ; while the developement of our manu. factunng industry has been carried on by other means. England, therefore, by affording our western districts a. valuable market for their products, has contributed greatly to the industral and commercial regeneration of an important portion of this country.
ii;THr LATE CAPTAiN TiiosPsox, C.B.The heroism displayed by the late Captain Thorepson has already been acknowledged and warmly commnended in this journal. It is satisfactory to find that his merits are fully appreciated elsewhere, and we have much pleasure iix announcing, on official authority, that His Majesty the Emperor of the French has just forwarded a donation o£ l,OOOf. (401.) towards the Thompsou Memorial Fund. This generous act on the part of the Emperor surely affords a proof-if one were wanting-that France can and does appreciate gallantry and heroism among her faithful alies. The public may also be apprized of the fact that the pro. ceeds of the subscription will be appropriated for the benefit of the brother of Captain Thompson, who is said toa be a thorough soldier, an accomplished gentleman, and one who is likely to distinguish himself in the service. There is reason to believe that the King of Sardinia will shortly folow the noble example of his Imperial allD of France.
THE FRATRlCIDE AT MAIDSTONE.-The final examination of George Kebble Edwards, for the murder of his brother, Thomas Edwards, took place before the mayor andt borough magistrates yesterday morning. After evidence had been given in corroboration of the facts already men. tioned, the prisoner was asked if he had any statement tco make. His answer was, " I have nothing to say about the case, only that I am innocent of the crime." He was their fuDy committed to take his trial at the next assizes, on the charge of '"wilful murder." Before being removed from. the court be requested that the property found upon bint
whent apprehended should be restored, but his request wasnot complied with, and he was then tken to Maidston6 gaol to await his triaL.
T}IF MuwRDE AT DEAI.-Samuel Baker, accused of the murder of Ensign M'Carrol, of the 44th Regiment.
at Deal, under the citrcumstances mentioned in The Timcs, I underwent another examination yesterday before the magistrates, and was committed for trial at the ensuing assizes at; Maidstone.
SusPEcmD MLRDE R.-Last Thursday mornin _
the body of a man was found in the river Don, near the village of Conisbrough, about four miles from Doncaster An inquest took place the same day before Mr. W. Marratt, coroner, and, from the evidence given, it appeared that the deceased was a married man named Lambert, 49 years old. a colher. Hle left home on the 3d of January, and had not; been heard of since. On that night he was at a& publichouse at Rotherham, and had a quarrel witkx two young men tbere, but it did not apnear that; they had used any violence towards him. The sur. geon 'who made a post nortem examination of the body spoke of wounds in various parts, and said that several of the front teeth were missing. In his opinion, however, the inuries might have been occasioned by a falL The publichouse in question is near the river Don.
