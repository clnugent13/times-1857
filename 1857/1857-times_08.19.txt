MWA.MENTARY INTEIGENCE. HO'3SE OF LORDS, TumkY, AGUSn 18. The LoBD Cn.ANEgLOR took his seat on the wooleack at 5 Oclock. Lord COLVILLE of CULEROSS presented a petition from the Commissioners of Supply for the county of Wigton against the Police (Scotland) Bill. I TRUSTEES' RELIEF BIILTl Lord ST. LEONARD'S said it would be in the trecouec-- tiems of tbe Honse that when the Government announced their intention to bring in a Bill to panish fr.ruduleat trustees he suggested to his noble and learned friend on the woolsack that the measure ought to be accompanied by another for the purpose of affording relief to trustees, who would otherwise be vsited with very considerable damages, although they had acted honestly, and without the slightest benefit to themselves, in the execution of their trusts. (Hear, hear.) He thought it was the duty of the Government to undertake a measure of that nature in connexion with one the object of which was to infict unisahment on fraudulent trustees, but when he made that suggestion to his noble and learned friend on the 0woolsack his noble and learned friend said it was irapracticable. He (Lord St. Leonard's) stated in answer that the suggestion was attended with difficulty, but that he did not admit it was impracticable; and he added that if the Government did not do what he thoughti they ought to do in this matter he himself would endeavour to frame a measure which he hoped would meet the exigencies of tne case. He did aiccordingly framne such a measure with gjreat pains and care, andsvwith the asistance of competent persons, and that measure lay on the table for many weeks for the exprens purpose that it might bo fully investigated. Thae BiUl afterwards passed through committee, and, haeing ehen read a third time, was sent downu to the Eoase of Commnonk, where it was read a second time, and then last nighet itwas proposed in that Hotse to puet i iato commitbte. Oa tha occasion, however, the learned organ of the Government in th Hlouse of Comaons stated that the moeasure was so inaccurate and obscure, and so inadetulte for the purpose for which it was intended, that it wouldrequize at le st three days to mise it right. That learned person then added with the coSidence wfhich belonged to him (a clugh), anrd by which he was le th imagine that he could make that clear which was obscure, an stituto light for darkness, end make that ade nate which was inadequate, that he himlself wonld tndertake to introduce a suitable meure on te subjectin the nextsession of Parliament, Hle certainly was astonished to learn tht haat learned person ha,d spoken in thaos terms of a measure whicd sad been prepared with suchgreate are and deliberation. (Wear, hear.) That measure, howeover, Was new before the public and the profession, and they would form their own opinion of it. In framing that measuree a had but one object in vier, namely, to relieve trustees from the danger whieh now surrounded them in the execution of their trusts, and he now gavenotice thatearly in the next session he should re-introduce the BSil in question. The LORD CHCELLOR sa he thought his noble and learned friend must have miisunderstood himn when he stated that he (the iord Chancellor) had said a measure of the kind suggested by him was tmpreticable. What he said was that he thought it impracticable to leave the duties of trustees such as they were and to relieve them by saying that,th tho they had committed breaches of trusr, they should not be responsible. As to what had passed in tho other House of Parlaamont. he must say, the time wvas when even to allude to any measure in progress in that House was an inringement of their lordipsh rules, and he thought for his noble and learned friend to sanction with his weight and stationintheir lordahips' House the practice of raising discussions upon reports of debates in the other House that had appeared in the public prints was most inconvenient. (Hear, hear,) Whether what his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General had stated in the other House on the ocosionn L question was acncrately or inaceuratelr reported he would not stop to inquire, for their lord ships House Was not the proper place to disctss the matter. He could only say that in themnet sessionihe would be roeady to ehis most anxious attention to any Bill which the nobde and learned lord might introduce on this subject, TEE DIVOIRCE BILL Lord ST. LEON a Ar D'S wished to ask what course the Government proposed to take with regard to the Divorce BilL He understood that Parliam,ent wtas to be prorogued on Saturday and the Divorce Bill was not likely to come uo to their lordshiph before Friday. He thought they would neglect their duty if they did not most carefully consider the effect of the alterations which had been arde inthe Bili by the other House, and he doubted vhether the arracge- ent which, he understood, wns proposed by the Governtment would afford sufficent time to their lordships for duler considering the amendments introduced in the bouse ot Commons. Earl GRANVILLE said that, as the noble and learned lord had not given notice of his question, he wsirs not able to give him adecided aswsver, He (Earl Granville) was rnot aware whether Parliament would be prorogued on SatsrdaT or not, and he was unable to sate when the Divorce Bill might be expected to come up from the house of Commons. Hredid not think, however, when that BiU was sent up to their lordships that the consideration of the amendments made in the other s ouse would occupy any long time. Lord CA1§PBELL earnestly hoped that, howvever the session might be protracted, it would not be alosed until full time had been afforded to their lordahips for consideringltheuamendments maesin the an e Bill by the ormi er House of Parlament. and expressiag their asseot to or dissent from those amendments. he would regard it as a national calam 'y tf a prorogation took place without that Bill becoming, in some shape or other, the lawr of the land. The measure had received most careful consideration in their lordships' House - it had oacloied the attention of the other House of Parliament for mansy dayst nd nights and he beleved it was not probable that at any future time the two Htouses wolnd arrive at a more satisfactory ionclusion upon this question than during the remainder of the present session. Lord REDESDhLE concur-red in the opinion expressed by the noble and learned lord, and thought it, would be utterly impossible in the time which would intervene before the proposed termidation of the session that their lordsh{ps could properly consider the alterations in the Divorce Bila, which would come down from the other HXouse almost a new, measure. The changes whieh had eeen made in that Bill were of the utmost importance (hear, hear), and iu his opinioa such a measure, which deeply affetesd the interests of every home in this kingdom, could not be properly considered by so thin an attendance of peers as there wfould bes when the Bill came baek from the other House. IEarl GRNBVILLE saidthe GoverLnment wouldcertainly not adopt the implied suggestion of the noble lord, that the Bill should be ostponed to the ensuiag session. He necderstood that the discussion of the measurenhad beea onducted with tbe utmost temper and friendliness in the other House that morniiag, and he could only express his hope that a similr spirit hould be manifested by their lordaships hen the Bill agsai ctae before them. PRBACBTES AD LETTERS OF ADINSTRATIONT BIhL. On r of rder the day for considering the Commoans' amnendments to this Bill, The LORD CthANCELQ OR said it would be necessary for him to state to their lordThips very bried the nature of the amendmeats which had been made in this Bill in the other Hou3se. The principle of the Bill, as it passed their lordships, was that all ecclesiastical jurisdiction with ratpect to the matters to wich it related should terminate, and, it has proposed that a Queen's Court of Probate should be established in London, the judge of such court being appointed by the Crowln The Bill proposed that that court shold deal with allconten tiobus cases asto the probate of wills, anrd that from 0 to 40 courts should be established in various districts throughout the country, in which wills renltin to property below the amount of 1,e, as to which thee was no contest, mright be proved. It was also proposed that theoproctors of the court in L4ondon should contiue to possess the exclusive 'right of practising with regard to noncontentious basiness; but that the general body of solicitors and barristers should be admitted to practise, so far ae contentious business was concerned, concurrently with proctore and advcate The main featuresof the Bill had n,ot been changed in the House of Commons, but the material alterations made in that House were that the provision confining the juHrisdiction of the district courts to nonwcontentionts cases in wthich property below the value of w.h001h was involved had been altered in such a mnner as to give these courts jurisdiction in all cases, whatever nright be 9he amount of property, provided there was no contest as to the validity of the will and the tostsator die-i wsithin the district. That wvas a change as to the propriety 'Of which there nsight be considerable diffierence of opmnion, but the arra2gementlie proposed, as well as that adopted by theHouse of Commons, were both attended with advantgges and disadvantageg. TheoBill, as he introduced it, provided, in ronfcriy with the-report of the commissioners. that tioe non-contentiors business in the London court should be transacted exolusively through the agency of proctors. The House of Commons, however, haA not s.ssented to that proposal, but had determined that the exclusive sivileges of proctors should be abolished, and that all soHectors and. attorneys shoil be admitted to a share of the business. He did nei think he would act wisely in proposing the rejection o! that amendment. The House of Commons also adopted a money resolution which, he confessed, he was unable in pr. nciple to approve. The Commons decided that all those ge utlemen who were deprived of their monopoly in the practia a should on that account receive a large compensation. It' would be idle now to discu6s that question, but he had at several stage of tbe Bill expressed his opinion that the dimix ution of prac- tee was aot a legitimate ground for compe n, iation. Hovwever, these -who were the guardians of the pablic purse thought differently, and had provided compensa tion equivalent to one-half of what those gentlemen befc -re made by the practice, to share in which hundreds of (, ther prac- titioners were now to be alowed. These were the main chbanges made by the House of Commons, baht a, 1i umber of minor alterations had also been effected. In the f, st place an alteration had been made, which he thought a nus f ui im- provernent, in regard to the appeal from the deei, ion of 1be County Conrt Judges. It had been decided b, v the Commons that the appeal should be to the Couxt of pro bate tstelf, and he should ask their lordsahps to add to that cha. 'gN 2n mercy to the parties themselves, that on such appeal t. h5'~ decision of the Court of Probate should be final, and that th e parties shoald not be allowed to carrn ib furdher. With' respect to the proedure of the Co ert, it was thourht iTn the other House thlat the cause empowering the Lord Chanceolor with t,Li Lord Chief Justice to framoe rles was so wordec tdatit might be left apd ni-nrcs vai lendas before the rules wexe framed, and the cluse'was now altered seas to requarethat the framing of the roles should becn ourreni wifh.the coming into edstence of the new court, To that charnge sp thought that none of their lordships would object. With respect to one cause of procedure, on which a faec were te beatred by a jury, a discretion tc; wr 'titan bfore Jaine og So Xead ;hem to he tri by another court. In their lordships' House it was proposed that th3 first judge of the Probate Court should be the present judge of the Prerogative Court. An alte.ation had bqen made in that provislon, but he thought it inmnaterig for he understood that nothing would have induced that very learned and excellent person to accept the office, bat inasmuth as he was not entitled to coinpensatlon as judge of the Prerogative Court the Commons had introduced words into the Bill, giving him conapensation in respect to his office. It as quite obvious that the adoption of these amedndmeets was essential to the passing of the Bill, and, therefore, whether they were all precisely such as their lerdebips would visa them to be, the question was wheeher the Bill in its pzesent form was a great improvement or not on the present system. It their lordehips thought it was an improvement he trusted that they would feel no difficulty in agreeing to the amendments, and he therefore moved that, with some verbal alterations, their lordships should substantially agree to the amendments of the Commons. Lord WYNFORD expressed his opPosition to the amend. ment extending the jurisdiction of the district coarts, which had been declared by a learned gentleman in the House of Commons as being most destruotive and most dangerous to the security oi property. Indeed, the learned gentleman had almost threatened that if the amendment were persisted in he would be obliged to.withdraw theBilL The learned gentleman (the Attorney-General) had used the strongest language in opposing the extension of this unlimited jarisdiction to the district courts, stating that he did not think it possible for him to zecommend the Government to accede to the clause as it now stood, apprebending, as he did, that if it were left in its present state the Bill might be converted into a great instrument of fraud. After theo enunciation of such opinions by the chief iw officer of the Government in another place, did the noble and learned lord, remembering, too, his own declaration on the subject, intend to adopt the amendment in question? If so, he (Lord Wystford) hoped their lordships would rdfese theirassenttoit- and even though it should be his lot to go out alone he should certainly divide the House on the subject. The noble lord concluded by moving'that their lordships disagree with the Commons' amendments in the 40{th and 70th clauses Lord. ST. LEONARD'S, although he conourred with the noble lord who had just spoken in disapproving of the Commons! amendments in the 40th and 70th clauses, yet advised bim notb at this period of the session to persevere in his oppontion, as he gt thereby endanger the passing of the Bll. He was greatly surprised that the House of Commons, who held thoepublie puree, should have consented tofgive to the proctors compensation to the amount of 1t0,hat . a-year The principle of this BilU With regard to compensation would le hereafter referred to in favour of improper, anton, and unnecessary oompensation. LordOC PBELLas glad that his noble and learned friend had given such conciliatory advice to his nobole friend (Lord Wyanfordl). Athough he did not hinself approde the wMhole of the Bil, yet, taking it all in ell, he thought that it |would be agre.t bcoon to the country. 'With regard to the q,uestlon of compensation, he had alwvays held the opinion teat wherever by an improvement in the law an office wras abolished there ought to be compensation. The LORKD CEHANCELLOR said that if their lordshlps wvere to wrait until beth Houses agreed on every detai?l of a Bill hardly any measure wvould ever pass. He thought the safeguards introduced into this measure would be effectaal for their object. With regard to compensation, he believed that its probable amount wvas considerablyover-sated as 100,OOL The proctors now received wvhat vwas calledths " protor's fee" on every probate. That fee would eventually be abolished; but he was afraid a portion of it would have to be retained for a time to meet this claim for compensation. With respect to the remark of a noble lord as to forged wills the existing law was that if probate had 'oeen granted on such a will the Bank was entitled to be indernnified. Lord WYNFORD then withdrew his motion, and the Commons' amendments, with certain verbal alterations, were agreed to. PIMILICO IMPROVEMENTS BILL. Tho standing order having been waived in favour of this BlI, on the motion of Earl GsANVIILE, it was read a second time. D`ENBAR HARBOUR LOAN BILL. The same exception having been made on behalf of this Bil, on the motion of Lord P2AruexE, it was also read a second time. METROPOLITAN POLICE STATION, &c. BML. Earl GRANVILLE moved that, inasmuch as this measure was intended to make a better provision for the health and efficiency of the metropolitan policeforce, its immediate consideration by their lordships was expedient and neceOaSy. Lord REDESD ALE objected to the motion, on the ground that no real case of urgency had been established for this BilL Earl GRANVILLE said that great inconvenience would be occasioned if this Bill were postponed till next session. The motion was then agreed to, and the Bill was read a second time. CONSOLEDATED YUND (APPROPRIATION) BILL. This Bill was read a scoond time. MILITIA PAY BILL. This Bll was also reaa a second time. REVISING BARRISTERS (DUBLIN) BILL. The LORPD CHANCELLOR moved, pnusuan' to notice, that inasmuch as the appointment of an additional assistant-barrister is absolutely necessary in order to proceed with bo roglstration of voters in the county of Dablin, the i,-i oumstanoee which render legislatioen n the subject-snatter of the said Bill expedient are of such urgency as to render the immediate consideration of the same necessary. Lord CAMfPBELL thought that, as the Lord-Lieutenant already appointed one revising barrister, the appointment of the additional revising barrister ought to be vested in the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in Ireland. The motion was then agreed to, and the BiU read a second time.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, TuzsD.&Y, AUGUST 18. The SPEAxx took the chair at 12 o'clock. MERSEY CONSERVANCY (No. 2) BILL. Upon the motion of Mr. BWART, the select committee on this Bill was appointed, to consist of Mr. Fitzroy, Mr. J. Ewart, and Mr. Kinglake. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES (STAMP DUTIES) BILL. The House then went into committee upon this Bill Upon the motion of Mr. Bou1vJRIs, in the absencs of Mr. Wilson, the following clauses were agreed to:- " That the same amount of stamp duty as is now payable on the admission of a proctor to any ecclesiastical courtshail be payable by every person to be admitted as a proctor in the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, or in the Court of Probate, vwho shall not have been previouly admitted as a proctor in the other of such courts, or in an Ecclesiastical or Admiralty Court, and have paid the stamp duty ia respect theref : " That every person who shall practise as a proctor or as a solicitor or attorney in the said Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, or the said Court of Probate, shall obtain an annual certificate to authorize him 6s to do under the Stamp Duty Acts in the same manner as proctors practising in theEcliclesiastical or A dmiralty Courts and solicitors and attornsys practising in Eer Majesty's courts at Westminsterare nowrequired to dobythesaid Acts or any of themn." DIVORCE ANTD MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. The consideration of this Bill was resumed in committee. On clause 53, relating to the remarriage of parties, Sir W. HEATH1COTI said it was with great pain he had to communicate to the committoe that his right hon. friend and colleague, who had an important amendment coming next in order, had been subjected to a very severe do. mesticealamity, the apprehension of which had prevented hii attendance yesterday, and the actual oceurrence of which would now rcnder his presence impossible. Under these cir. cumst&icee he hd to throw himeslf upon the indulgence of the committee in presuming, at very short notice, to bring before them an amondment which ought to bave been in so much better hands. (Eear, hear.) The amendment of which his right hon. friend and colleague had given notice was to leave out all the words after "ma rry again," in the last line but one-viz., " as if the pror marriage had been dissolved by death"-for the purpose of inserting "in the office of the registrar." The effect of that would be tltat the xespective parties in a divoree case would be allowed under the clause to marry again; but they would be obliged to be married before the superintendent registrar. He raight take that opportunity of saying, that although the words ht had read were quite sufficient to rai5 the discusion, yet hb appreheanded it would be necoesry to add, in the evezt of their being arried, words for the parpose of showing distinctly that marriages before the registrar should take 4ce under the conditions of an Act passed in the last sessicu, by which t. he marriage in tho foice of the xeAsa did nOt isi ny wy pr, sclude the r*ligious ceremony fterwards (E4ar, hear.) Pot ice had been given of other amendments, tio erect of & hiwould be to leave the pries div re to be , ied in the ordinary way, but; to exempt. from I 'enAtlies any clorgyman who shoud' re!se. so to marry' V teac. Now, the Attorney-General, in1 an-exrly -par~t of is debates, poinxted out the Inerpqdieisciof ^.vand in the se breath providing seeptioai for pereces \Weh did not obey it. If the comm ttea 'rere driven to th.' ,i torntle fie thonght reasomle en~ht be vhx xr id ttion; but h@e g faer agec Mneh tho Attorney-General that he would prefer putting the law on such a footing that it would uot be necessary for any one to claim an exemption under it. (ear, hear.) As far A the clergy and the persons seeking marria6e were concerned the amendment which he intended to propose on behalf of hlg right hon. friend and coUleagae came ae-Stly to the same point as those to wbhih he had just referred. Divorced persons going before a registrar would be enabled under his amendment to be married, and although they could not under the Act of last session compel any clergymarL to add the religious ceremony, vet that was ooin moA to all the other amendments, which expressly provided that no clergyman should be obliged to marry tbem. The superiority of his amendment consisted in its allowing the law to be carimed out in a regular manner, without the necessity of exempting any one from obeying it, and obviating the objections pointed out by the Attorney-GeneraL (Hear, hear.) It had bceen represented as hard to suLbject divorced persons to what was deemed an inferior mode of becoming mrarried. He asserted, on the other hand, that wvhern the Act of last session was passed, marriage before a registrar was put upon an equality with marriage in a chuirch, for the express purpose of meeting the conscientious and very reason3ble ecruples of Dssenters. It was open to any person to superadd to the civil ceremony any form of religious sauction which they thought fit. Considering the religious differences which existed in England at the present day, he saw no reason why every marriage should not commence with the civil ceremony; but, atany rate, they had noright to say that marriage before a registrar would plxce parties in an inferior position, especi when they would, have an opportunity of superadding the rehgious ceremony in the event of their being able to induce a clergyman to perform it. The Act of last session contained a recognition of two principles important to his present argment. One was thau, notwithstandinig all the forms which the Act prescribed had been gone through, no minister of religion should be obliged to take notice of those forms, or solemnize marriages which were initiated in the office of a registrar; in other words, ministers of religion were relieved from the obligation of perforniing the religious ceremony over those who commenced their marriage not in accordance with the mode prescribed by the denotniination tio which they belong. The other was that prsrons who were desirous to xdd the religious ceremony ordained by the church might do so, if they coid indulce a clergyman to perform it, not only to the notise commenced in the office of the registrar, but to the actual marriage oompleted before that functionary. He held, therefore, that the provisions of the Marriage Act, applying as they did in both directions, giving a preccdent for respecting the conscientious scraples of clergymen, and at the same time affording the divorced persons who might be remarried before a registrar all the advantages of the religious ceremony, went far to remove the various objections wlioh had been stated against his amendment. (Hear.) Some of the dergy entertained conscientious scruples against remarrying any person whose previous marriage had been dissolved by divorce. Others, again, believed they were prohibited from marrying the guilty party, while others objected to marry the two persons who had been parties to the act which had led, to the dissolution of the marriage. To one of those classes the large majority of the clergy of the Church of England belonged, and their opinions, he conceived, were not to be utterly disregarded. The consdentious scruples of the clergy had already been. recognized upon a much less important matter, and in following the same course upon the present occasion no iniury would be done to any party, as. henever a clergyman could be found who did not entertain objections to such marrisges the parties could obtain the advantage of the religious rite. It must be remembered too, that if parties whose conduot had led to a dissolution of their previous marriage were placedinasoniewhat inconvenient positionthey had not much to complain of for it would be too much to expect that persons who had been gauilty of such an offencoe should be placed upon exactly the same footing as persons who3e conduct had been irreproachable. Moreover, he believed that in scarcely one case out of 5,000 was tho party complaining entirely free from the imputation of having in some measure contributed to the unfortunate result. This Bil could not be regarded as the end of legislation. In future sessions fresh causes of divorce would be established, and as those canses were multiplied so would the objections of the clergy to remarriage be increased. At present the country was approaching rapidly to a complete distinction between the. civil and the religious aspect of marriage, and it would be a mere supersttion now to believe that any proceeding in a court of justice could have any effect upon the religions characor of the marriage contract. By adopting the amendment he proposed Parlfament would be confining itself to its legitimate functions of civil legislation, leaving the religions question to be dealt with bytheclergy. The lower order of the people, escecially in the country districts, had a notion that marrig excused all previous faults, and to legalize the intermarriage of adulterous persons would, he feared, lead to very lax ideas of the wickedness of seducing a neighbour's wife. If the Bill as it stood were forced upon the clergy, he mos; say, without in the least intending to hold out a threat, that he believed the feeling of that body was such that ii would be a most important step towards producing a severance of that connexion between the Church and the State which it was so desir ble to see maintained. (Bear, hear.) He proposed the amendment which had been suggested b 7 his rght hon. colleague, believing that ic tended to prevent such an event as he had just alluded to, that it kepi Parliament within the range of its proper functions, and that It would tend to muitigate the great social evUs which were to be apprehended from facilitating the granting of divorces. HIe aso believed this amendment would meet the purpose of all the other amendLments the objecs of which ws to protect the clergy from an oppression upon theilr consciences, and upon that and the other grounds ha had mentioned he asked the House to give the propoeition the same attentive consideration whioh he was sure it would have received had it had the advantage of being proposed by his right hon. colleague. (aear, hear.) The ATTORNEY-GENEB.AL expressed for himself and all the members on that (the Ministerial) side of the House his deep regret at the calamity which had deprived them of the presence of one who was the chief ornament of that assembly. (Hear he.) There was no man who more admired the ability and eloquence of that right hon. gentleman, or who could have more pleasure in bearing testimony to his distinguished talents than himself (the Attorney-General), but at the same time he did not think the case had lost anything by being committed to his hon. friend, considering the calm, judicious, impresdve, and probably successful mode in which the merits of the case had been presented to the House. (Eear, hear.) He regarded this as a most Important quetion, and one which they were bound to approach ill the most careful and deliberate maner. He would de. sire, therefore, to express to the committee the difficulties which he felt wi - regard to the proposal now before them, not with a view to defeat that proposal, but to assist, as far as lay in his power, in gtving the committee a right appre. hension of its bearings, and to asoertan, It possible, the best method of raising the important question pointed at in various amendments on their paper-that question being whether there should be a legal obligation on any clergy. man of the church of England who did not desire to marry divorced parties to celebrate such a marriage. (Eear.) The committee would observe that the proposition before them involved in the first place a provision that the divorced parties were to marry through the medium of the re&citrar, both the guilty and the innocent party being involved in this arrangement. Tfhen, in the second place, by strildn, out the words "as if the prior marriage had bsen dissolved by death," they arrived at the conclusion that the alteration was based upon the doctrine that marriage in the eye of the church of England wa3s to be regardedas an indissoluble (e, ear, hear,) Now, he submitted that on th ounds the amendment was highly objectionable. But he would further endeavour to explain to the committee the grounds of objection that would arise from adopting j theform of wrords laid down in the amendment. They would observe that the marriage was to take place "i,n the oflice of theregistrar." That das an affermative proposition. The ties might marry in the office of the registrar; they mtght go out to the world and mix in SObiety |but some time afterwards the husband might form another engagementoand marry in facie eccg e 'w another woman. Would that marriage be good or not, the other woman being totally ignorant of the husband having been divorced ! According to the sense of the proposition before them, ha would say that the marriage would be good, becauss the proposition contained nO negative words to the effect that the parties should not marry elsew,here. But suppose it wzas meant to alter The words, giving them a negative form which would prohibit the parties marrying elsewhere, what would be the effect? The man and woman would go out to the world, and some years afterwards, perhaps, the man might contract a marriage with an ianocent woman-it might be in a high condition of life, though that in no way affected the question. They had gone out into the wrorld with the capacity to commit fraud of the crueles: kind,because the man might marry a woman who knerw nothing of the prohibition that attached to him, (lear.) In such a case the innocent woman would be dereived in the most cruel and heartless manner, because it would be no marriage at l,t and her innocent offspring would ba bastards. (Hear, hear.) AU this would spring from puttin, a man and woman in a negative situation, from which no benefit could result. Now, be did not think that a desirable state of things. (Hear,) His condusion was that they could not arrive at a right decision on the great question they had to settle-that of the reluctanoe of clergymen of the church of England to marry divorced personswithout haig regard to the amendments of the right hon. gentlemea the member for the University of Of Cambridge, snd that of the gallant major the member for Harwich. He had pointed 4out one diffioulty arising from the proposition before them. He would shortly advert to another. Marriage might be solemnized in three or four different ways according to the law. There was tho form of celebration which took place in the face of the churoh of England; but another was by the 4different clergymen of Dissenting denominations in registered ehapels.-as, for example, in the chapels of Quakers, in the synagogae3 of the Jews. Now, did his hon. friend men to say that divorced partieg were not to go and be maried in a chapel belonging to their own peruasion ? And yet hds amendment wouid prohibit all such m riages. (ear.) His humble advice was not to try the great question of the scruples of clergymen of the church of England, which they bad to determine by the proposition now before the committee, hat to let ihat point, be tried on the oth6r- amendments to which he -lied referred. He desired to approach that q uestion with the kreatest possible deferenoe to the opinion of the large body of eW. - men who had signed the delaration, bat he did hs than2c tbat thirneidmant afforded the best opDorttnity for die- ~ussingit,andhe hoped thehon. baronet wvald WIthdratw his popsition and take the discussio on this imporant maeter onohe of the other amendments before the House. Ir. OP1 E thanked the Attorney.Gentral for the calm tone an which he had approached this question (hear), but he coutd not help thinking that the amendment now before the House offered the least iuvidioas moe of effet. iDg.the object i 'lew. It wouldavoid the possibifit.of the *lergi;a quw ple takIAs.&Aiffe%qut coure from th@ clerg in another, and all the inoonveniences to which such a con flict of practice would give rlse. In the year 1849 the right hon. mermber for Berkebire (Mr. S. Wortley) carried a Bill through that aouoe for legalzing marriage with a'deceased wife's sister, ia which vwa contained a clause exempting the clergy from performing such marriages; and all that was now asked was a similar exemption in the case of the remarriage of divorced pesons. Mr. NE WDEGATE said, that the able argument of the Attorney-General had convinced him that.thi% amendment would accomplish too mach. By adopting it the House would plainly state that it meant to continue in the couIrs which had been too long followed, of considering marriage merely as a civil contract. He was afrsid thar in providing against the evil consequences of the crime ok adultery Pailiament would be lending a vital sanctioa to its oasio which the church Catholic had universally refused. He hoped that the House would not thus separate Itself from the influence of Christianity. The church had 3nercifully modified the doctrine of indissolubility of marriago to meet the weakness of human nature. He trasted that the committee would do nothing which mf;ht endanger the conedn 'cetwreen. Church and State, or, if they preferred the expression, betweea tho State aad Christianity; and that they would show as much respect for the consCientious sreples of lergymen of the charch of England as had already been, exhibited for those of Dissenters and Rtoman Catholics. Mr. GRIFFITa opposed the amendment, becuse it would be unjust to punish an innocenthusbaud, and still more an innocent wife, by refasing them remarrige except in the offioe of a registrar. lord T. MANNERS, after complimenting the AttorneyGaneral upon. the singular abilty and moderation wish which he had conducted his argument upon this occasion, disputed the position of the hon. and learned gentlenin, that by the adoption of this amendment the HIouse would deliberately express the opinion. that aording to-the doctrine of the church of E;ngland marriage ws indissoluble. On the contrary, the amendment kept out of sight all allusion to the doctrines of the church, The Bill itsel compeUed them to discuss marriag, divorce, and remarriage as matters of purely civil ooncern. The other objections which had been urged against the gamendment of his hon. friend by the learned AttorneGeneral were not, he thought, altogether of that miagitude to induce the House to decline further coosideration of the subject. There was one objection taken by the learned Attorney-General which he did not clearly understand, and that was the objection which he had taken to the words oft the clause as they stood in an affirmative secse, but the learned gentleman had lid greater stress upon certain negative words, which he said ought to be introduced in order to carry out the object of my ;hou. friend. Now, the whole argument of the Attorney-General had proceeded upon the assumption that it was necessary that those negative words should be inserted, and he was bound to admit that he had never heard any argument more clear or comprehensive than that-by which the learned gentleman had demolished those words. (Hear.4 The committee, however, must remember that the suggestion of the insertion of these words had not emanated from his hon. friend, but from the Attorney-General liinocf. (Hear, bear.) Well, then, the learned Attorney-General had referred to the case of Dssenters, and had stated that they would not, if they came within the operation of this clause, be able to have the ceremony pertormed acording to their own rites, bat he thought that his hon. friend had clearly pointed out that under the provisions of an Act which was passed last year the membrs of every dissenting communion had full right after the marriage in the registrars office to have a religious ceremony performed in accordance with their religious persuasions. He did. not think, therefore, that the clause would have that influence upon Dissenters which the learned Attorney-General appeared to suppose. For his own part, he considered that the Dissenters had almost an equal interest with members of the church in the matter, and he had not been at all surprised that they had joinod in petitioning agant certain clauses of the Bill. He would, howrever, wvish particularly to directthe attention of thecommitte to the main point at issue, which was, whether the hardship which would bo inflicted upon those uniortunate persons who, with no fault on their side, had suffered from the commisdon of adultery, -was so great as to outwesigh all the advantages which rnight arise from settling the question in a manner which woald be in accordance with the feeling and the opinionof a great majority of the people of the country. For his own paIt, he considered that the advantages would outweigh the hardship which would be inficted, and he should be gladi to see the committee settle the question in an amicable way and in accordance with public feeling and opinion. (Hear, hear.) Mr. ADAMS considered that it would be advisable to withdraw the amendment, and to allow the oommittee to proceed to the discussion of one of the amendments which it was intended subsequently to propose, The committee would find that if facilities were afforded for the solemnization of marriage before a registrar it would lead to the neglect of that religious sanction of the ceremony which they must all desire to promote, He did not besides think it right that the innocent parties to a suit for divorco should be compelled to forego that sanction.; and, while he ws disposed to pay the ultmost respect to t he conscientious scrupl es of the clergy, be should venture for the reasons which he hadstated to suggest to the hon. baronet the member for the Universty of Oxford the expediency of withdrawing his amnendment. Lord LOVAINE said, if the amendment were persevered In he should feel it to be his duty to vote for its adoption, although he could not help regarding it as a hardship that innocent parties should not be enabled to secure forthe marriage oontrct the benefit which was to be derived from its solemnizatmion in accordance with the ordinary rales of the church. Mr. BRISCOE said, he considered the conscientious scruples of the dergy entitled to the utmost respect, and expressed a hope that the committee might be able to come to a decision upon the question before them withoat any party being entitled to claim the victory. Mr. SPOONER observed that he had hitherto been a silent, but by no means an indifferent participator in tbe Droceeding which bad taken place in reference to the BilL. Eehad been so because the sabject with which it proposed to deal wras one, in his opinion, of a most difficult character; but while he enteri;ained that view he could not content himself with giving a sient vote upon that occssion. He was opposed to the amendment under the notice of the committee, because, believing marrige upon Scriptural authority to be dissoluble upon the ground of adu:ltery, he did not thin that the innocent parties, in the case of a dis.ioln.- tion of the marriage tie, should be debarred from the privilege of being remarried in the face of the church. He trusted that the hon. baronet would withdraw the amendment, and that the committee would not be called upon to divide on the amendment of the right hon. member for the University of Cambridge. Mr. MALINS joined in the request that the amnendment should be withdrawn, ia order that the sense of the committee might be taken either on the amendment of his right hon. friend (Air. Walpole), or that of the gallant member for Earwich (Major Warburton). Sir W. HREATHCOTE said it appeared that one part of the amendment, which was directed towards the discouragement of the remarriage of divorced persons, was not generally acceptable, and tat the other part, which proposed to relieve the clergy, met with coiderable favour. In the opiniontof mny onv genentlemn the latter question was more capable of being advantageously raised on other amendments, and he w oas therefore ready to withdraw his amendment to make room for them. (rear, hear.) The amlendment was then cithdrgwn. Major ohrBUiivTON submitted that there would be littlepractical inc hvenience fro uthe clergybeing exempte from the compulsory solenniation of the marriages of divorced persons, as many of them might be 'willing to celebrate those marriages; and if not, the registry-office would be still open. The condition of a clergymuar was different from any other individural, iasmrch as he could not recede from the oflice whichL he assumed, and no clergyman at present in orders knew that toat lhe inewrrnd this respounibility, because it wras forothe st te pi aboun t be made part of the writ ten law of England that divorced persons mghtarry againt (Hear) w h e appealed to mtembers of theChurch of Englandtoprotect the feelings of their clergy as they wouldprotect their own, and to those who wvere not members of the Church of iEcgland, inL the name of religious freedom, to protect the feeiengs of the clergy, rememberingdthat their forefather knew onrly teo well what it was to suffer for consciene' sake the pains and penalties of the laws of Engand. (Eear, hear.) He begged to move the amendmentb of whiLch he had given notice, adopting an amendment of the noble lord the member for Marylebone, which would protect the clergy in case of tjuer solemni2ng, as well as in the case of their reflsing to solemnize, these marriags. The amendment was to add at the end of the clouse:e " Provided always, and be it enacted, that no priest or deacon shall be liable to any suit, penalty, or censure for solemnizing or refusing to solemnize the mariage of any person who shall be divorced by rtue of the Act." wtr.WlGAl said the c aim of the clergy was a claim of justice. Could any candid or impartial man, looking attenrtively throuLgh the marriage service of the ChuLrch of E;ngland, say that a conscientious clergymanL could read it over persons one of whom was divorced V It commenced with a solemninvocation to the parties, as in the presence of Almighty God, that they would declare any cause or impediment to their mariage, and towards the conclusion it pr- nounced marriage to be so constituted by Him thai it could never be dissolved. The words were unequivocal and unambiguous, and a m r of the Church of England must accept them in their literal form, without explanation or modification. Let them consider the position of a minister ho had to red that service over tvwo of his parishioners if he had previously read it over one of them, and knew that he or she had committed adultery and violated the marriage contract. (HIear-) Could that clergyman with any satisfaotion to his conscience invoke that person, as in the presenoe of the Almighty, to declare 'whether there was any lawful impediment to Eis remarriage 2 He was persaded that a great majority of the clergy would feel that they were malkng a mockery of the marriage service if they were to read it over parties who had been divorced. Aplain appeal was now made to the justine of the Legislature. The rubrics of the church were held to be engrafted on the Act of Uniformity, and by them a minister was compeUed, not to read any earvice he pleased, but to read the particular marriage service prescribed by the church over all persons whom he joined-in marriage. Now, whereas the marriage service was framed at s time when marriage was held to be indissoluble, the Legislature was gow asked to introduce an entirely new state of things, and to declare the dissolubility of marriage. ln these circumstances they were bound to talke one of two alternative courses-either to modify the marfviage service ef the church, or else to give the clergyman an optionas to whether he would read it or not. It was too la5e to thinkef qualifying the services of the church in the 'mre snt session, and they were therefore forced to adopt the IMe6'r coutse of saying that those clergymen who COn5emies,'ously vb*ted to reading the existing marriae seet- iee e persus who had been guilty of adultery oshoud not be . Ompelled to do so. No pesoncoud look at this Uestio -withoutfeeZings of apprehension.

Nowr, wholtever might be bur opinion of the probable effects of the present Bill, nobody could. deny that its powers might be abused;and surely if vw coud prvent en b arllous influence operating upon their minds from inga bad e of the lberty which it was now sought to confer upon thena, we ought to avail ourselves of every means of accomplishing tht obiect. (Rear, hear.) That about three.fouthsof.She whole clerical profeesion had joined in a memnorial to Parliamnent VAs a stiking fact, which he was sur the Government, who wrere inclined to respfect the feelings 4f the coun7ny, would not overlook or underestimate. It hadbeen saidthttheclergy never rmde any difficulty before. That wa~ true; but the reason was that the questin was now' rased for the first time. From the time of the Reformstion there had been altogether about 300 divorcee It was exceedinly improbable that there had been more than l0a remarriages, and of these he ventud o y that not above SO hadtahken place in this country. The probability was thIat in many cases the clergymnen dia not know that theb psrties hdeen divorced, and it was q,uite absurd to say that the fewr instances whlich had occurred ot~ lergymen negligently reading the marriae eVeover parties w baa been guilty ot adultery inftornier merriages formed sayr precedent aga:inst the c laim now mde by thke whsole prdfessloe.

He did not shae in tme oeinon of the hon. and learned gentleman with respect to the rniage serie ncr did he believe that the scruples he hbd mentioned' wereso universal among the clergy as he suppoed. (Hear.) The conWscientious scrnples of the clergy were undoubtedlr entitled to respectfal consideration, but he ws not an advocate of priestly domination, and therefore held that thoHouse had power to pass laws which were binding upon the, clergy. Afthe same time, thigs which were direfu werenot necessanly expedient, and he bad a grave objection tocreatinR professional martyr He felt that it wouds beunwiss as well as cruel to encumber a useful measure with. any cluses pressing hemvily uponcertain clergymen, ae would be the-ase if no amendment were adopted. They were bound to recognize and weigh the cmnsientioun. scraples of clergymen who entertaiaed opinions that would prevent them from willjnly marrying divorced personsand in recognizing those scruples they would ayoid putting into the hands' ot the eocleaisical anthorities a weapon which would enable them to fly in the face of Parlianent and to persecute such of the clergy who might feel inclined, to comply with the provisions of the Act of Parliament, General THOMPSON wished to know what probabilitythere ws of any prticula- clergymn being made a martyr in consequenoa of the act of the eisature? it Was not likely that a person who had been divorced, and who wished To marry again, would go to a clergyman who was known toG entertain a repugnance to sach marriages, while there would never be any difficulty in finding ministers who-felt no such, scruples. Al erson who had been divorod would not apply in a quarter whenoe he must expect refusl, and thus revive the pablication of his misfortane. He (General Thompson)hada strong objections to forcing people to have recourde to the civil ceremony, and could not see wlhy the ciril ceremony should receivJ any artificial alight He was inclined tobelieve that cer it a system of something like'ooncubinagewould arise if such pains were taken to assign that form of marriage to th6 persons whom It was sought to discredit.

IMr. AYRTCN was desirous of doing nothing that wouldc wound the conacientious feelings of the clergy, but thought. this question must ho regarded in another light. He coulL. |not forget that the parish churches were not the property of the clergy, ada rector or vicar who entertained peculiar notions had no right to compel his paishioners to adopt thtose notions or to be debarred from the ulse of their ownD church. If a rector or other chief reverend authority in a parish objected to perform such rages as -ere referred, to by the clause now under discassion, there was no reason why he should be forced to peorm them, buetat the sametime he ought not to be allowed to prevent his urates from, officiatingiftheydidnotsharehis peculiaridei. Someof, the clergy, it apneared, objectedeven to remarryingthe innocent party, and ihe amendmentwould enable them to indulgetbeirsemi.poplsr notionsthat mariagewas asacramant.. If the clergy required relief it sbould be granted, but onlyso far as justicoe would allow. He agreed that now dutiesshould not be imposed upon a clergyman by Act of Parlia- ment if those duties were opposed to his conscientious. 'opwnlons; but at the same tme that lie would not interfere withthepresent positionof such clergymen, ye. liewoladnot. allow them to receive other preferment without acknowledging and yielding obedience to the law of the land. it, was true the legislature ought not to interfere with the theological viewsof the clergy,bat ithada rightto interfere, with and to regulate the ds-position of the church property. The rights of the laity should receive as much consideration as the elais of the clergy. If a clergyman Wainsuperable objections to perform what an Act of Parlia. ment required him to do, there should be a provision. in the Act to enable the parisioners to ca in another minister who entertined no sach scruples, Ii was an every day practice for clergymen toallow otherministers, frends of the paries, to celebratev marriage in their churches, and the exmple mihizt be follovwed, as he had sugetd, to the advantage of all parties. Hle veould entreat the Government not to be ledi away by their feelinga of respect towards the church, but to adopt .- course that was just towards the clergy, and at the same time did not trench upon the rights of the laity. Mr. WALPOLIR-The hon. gentlemaL who has jIus spoken says-aud I am sorry he has introduced such a tone2. into this discussion-that, though it might be right to sp. port a clause that would not be oppressive to tihe clergy, we must at the same time protect the consciencos of the laity. That, he will permit me to observe, has been the spirit or' our legiation, down to this period. I have always ha in view these two objects, and there is nothing in thpe amend- ment now before the committee that iB in any way contraryto such a view ofr y duty. (Hear, hear.) The hon gentle. man must forgive me for saying that 'I am not.- going to support the amendment on any such imagi. nary ground as he supposes-viz., in order to allowany clergyman to remain in possession of all his rights anB privileges as a minister of the church of Enigland, while he* may secetly belong to another communion. (Hear, hear.). I think the hon. gentleman wil give me credit for s3ying, after the part I took in the' secondfreading of tbis Bi, tha I do not sapport the amendment on the ground that mar. - riage is indissoluble either by the law of God or by the law of the Land. (Hear, her.) That question I have folmud very distinctLy answrerd in the discussion of one of tbe. most imuportent points that could arise-viz, whether ths, adulterous paties ought to bo allowed to marry again ;_ for when itwas proposed in liS, as one of the stading orders of khe House of Lords, that a clause should be introduced into any divorce Bill prohibititg such mar. riages, the Archbishop of Canterbury, sneaking not only for himself but for the whole bench of b;ops, said in theface of Parliament that there was nothing in tlhe opinion of that right rev. bench, In the law of God eDntrary to thowe marriages, and that if they had been contrary to the law of God the bishops would long before have interposed, if possible, to prevent them. (Hea, hear.) I therefore take-- that statement as justifying me in saying that I proceed on no such grounds s that marriage is indissoluble. (Hear, hear.) I believe that for the one offence of adultery, and forthat one offence only, marriage both by scripture and by reason ought to be capable of dissolution. (Hear, hear.) Having disposed of those observations, I ma be asked tostate on what particular groands I spport the amendment now beforethe committee. The hon. and gallant member(Major Warburton) put his notice on the paper about the same time tlhat I put mine, but, as he tock some precedence of me ia doing so, I willingly gaveway to allow him to express his views to the Housta I need hardly sy that I am quite ready, in sapporting his amendment, to give thewhobIs credit of Wleting the object it ha in view to. the hon. and gallant genteman, or to the Government. if thevill only introduce a clause thit wl prove acceptable to all parties (Hear, hear.) I support theamendment on tins ground-and I think it is one which itis impossible to controvert-that we have no rght to im. pos on any pson or any class of persons in this countrythe pan diltmm of obeyg or disobeying oneof tworlaws. (Her, hear.) Why do say that that ground s un. a=swerabl&? Suppoee this Bill pass into a law, the remarisg of the parties to whom it has efterenoe will be ex- uresay allowed by statute. The remarriage of the parties, b expressly allowed by statote, any Derson would baat liy to go to-the clergyman of a parish and insist. on his marriage, though he had been divorced, and not only insist on his mariae bit insist on its being_ performed according to the rites and ceremonies of the. chuch of zUgland&Iuopose the two adulterous parties goI to tseudergyman of a =rih io bemarried, he requires of' thtem to stateinthezmust.aolenm manner whabber there isanyinpdiment to the solemnization of sach iage.

LONDON, WiDBESDAY, AUGUST 19, 3ss7. In the Houe of Lords last night, Iord ST. L5OeikDsS, on the Tiastees Relief EA mid that on a former occaion he had framed & meanure which he hoped would have met the exi. gencies of thlS cae. That measure had met with objections on the part of tihe Lon 0CnaRscn , who said it wanimpracicable; but it wsnow belcs,e the public and the profeson, and they would fonn their opinion of it. The LoRD CHtcrwoE , in reply, denied thut he had said the proposed measure was imprcticable. Their Lordahips' House was not the. proper plaoe to discuss the matter. He was ready to giv, his most anxious attention to any Bill in the next session which Lord ST. LXoxAan's might introduce on the subject. On the Divorce Bill, Lord ST. LXo0.n's asked what oourse the Government proposed to take I Lord GnA?iLa; said, that as Lord ST. Lzoitnns had not given notice of his question he was not able to give him a decided answer. Lord CAwn' hoped that however the seedon might be protracted it would not be cloted unti full time had been afforded to their Lordlhips for considering the amendments made in the other House. Lord RH smSnA did not think there wan time tD consider the alterations during the present session. Lord GxAwvmRT declared the Government would. ceraly not adopt the implied suggestion-that the Bl ihould be postponed to the emsuing esion. On the order of the day for considering the Commons' anendments to the Probates and Lettera of Administration Bill, the Lo_D CHAxC3LLoR made a brief satement of the nature of the amendments which had been made in the Bill in the other House. Lord WsroRD expressed his opposition to the amendment extending the jurisdiction of the district courts, and moved that their Lordships dis agree with the Commons' amendments in the 40th. and 70th clauses. Lord ST. I oxxA's, though he concurred with Lord Wv?uFoxD, advised him not to persevere in hin opposition at that period of the esion. After a few words from Lord CA xPrz and the LORD CHnacBmo lord WYNFo.D vithdrew hs motion. The following Billswere read a eecondtime:Pimlico lIprovements Bill, Dunbar Harbour Loan Bill, Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill, Militia ray Bill, Revising Barristers (Dablin) Bill, Probates ana Letters of Administrton (Ir3and) Bill, Mutiny (East India) Bill, Joint-Stoc7 Companies Act (856) Amendment Bill, ad Parochial Schoolma (Scotland) (No 2) BilL The House adjoured at ten minutes to 7 'clo. The House of Commons at the early sitting went into committee upon the Divorce and Matrimonial Causs Bill, when certainreslutions were agreed to for imposdng stanD duties, and then resumed the consideration of the Bll at the point iwhere the discussion left off on t he pr eceding evening-namely, the 63d clause That claue (it may be proper to repeat) enacts that, on the dissolution of a marriage, " it shaL be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry aga,s if the prior marriage had been dissolved by d:eath." Sir W. HxArTEcoT, in the absence of Mr. Gr;ADsToN- t-hrough a domestic calamity, moved an amendment, of which Mr. GrAnsTromz had given notioe, to leave out the words "as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death," and insert "i tmhe office of the registrar." This alteration, he said, would obviate conscientious scruples and prevent Parliament from exceeding the functions of a civil Iegislature, thereby avoiding what he regarded as one of the great evils of thi BilL The ATronNEY -Gzaaxsn observed that the question whether it should be made matter of legal obligation upon clergymen of£ the Church of England who did not desire to perform the ceremony of marriage betreen parties one or both of whom had been divorced to celebrate such a marriage was a most important one, and should be at proached in the most temperate m;anner. This amendment involved two propositions,-firs,t that innocent parties should be compelled to marr before the registra&; secondly, that marriage celebrated in facie . clesicc was in the eye of the church to be regarded as indissoluble. He pointed out the nsodal evils which would be the practical consequeuces of adopting the. amendment, and reommended that it should be withdrawn, and that the great question, vhether or not the clergy of the church of England should be exempted from the obligation to marry divoroed parties, should be raised in another form, and be tried and decided upon the amendments of which Mr. WALroLz and Major WA uRTow had given notice, and which disinctly raisd tnat simple question. The amendment having been debated for some time wan ultimately withdrawn. Major WAnuaro n moved a proviso at the end of the clause, " that no priest or deacon all be liable to any suit, penaty, or censure for solemnnizing, or refusing to solemnize, the mreof any peon who shl be divorced by virtue of the In the cour of the discliIon of this amendment, Mr. WAx.onz, who urged very sirongly that Par liament had no right to put art undue strain upoz the onscience of any party, andto pla im in-the dilemmn of beiDg compeled to obe disobey oe of two laws, earnestly appealed to. the Gornment to-acquieece in the amndmentc;- The ATro x-GmnnaA said he was authoesed by Lord PAiaEzar to propose a qualifid aocept aoa of the amendment; but before he stated tha terms, he set before tbe committee the considerations that had weigbed greatly with tbe Governmenit, and avowing that he gavo way not upon conviction, but in deference to those who deeplv felt thst the interestsof the Church ofEngland would be promoted th6reby, he warnedthe;Eouse in a very solemn and impresive manner of the evils that might follow in the train of this amendment. Asmuming, however, that the House would well weigh the matter, the Government wren willing, if a great majority were in farour of the endment, tocousenbtoa proviso inthewt¢n.-"That no priest or deacon shall be liabletoany suit, penalty, or censure for refusing to solemnize the marage of any person whose adultery or crime has been tha cause of the dissolution of the miarriage." After some further discussion, in order to meet an ohbjetion of Sir W. EbscCoTr, Tha- A moixy-GnmL&L substituted the folowgorm of the proiso, partly adopted from Mlr. %Wsj,oxs's proposed amendnent*~-:- That no ,cle.lyman in holy orders of 'the Unitedalhurch of 1xlaud au&iIreland: hall be cqmapelIedtooleiauiz
" An Englishman's house is his castle." There's a grand principle, easily understood and as easily enunciated. It is a constitution ir a nutshell, a social law in c'ne commandment. What an infinity of trouble '3 saved Vwhen you can avoid aU the conclusions of reason, all the suggestions of humanity, aU the lessons of experience, and all the dictates of common sense, by the simp'e expedient of shutting your door, and so intrenching yoturself in your own castle ! If anybody objects to it, let him do the same. Learn oi the snail. Threaten it, and it draws in its horns; attack it, and it shrinL-s within its shell. Were there no such thing as the heavy foot of man, a snail's politics would be sufficient. The immense simplicity of the doctrine is enough recommendation. Is not aU Christianity-so we are told in many of our pulpits-evolved from one or two principles ? We were never intended to carry libraries of learning, or lives of experience, or a school of philosophy, or a world of feeling within us. We must be meant for some simpler instinct. So why not that " every man's house is his castle ?" Let us all be barnacles or rock limpets ; let us hold fast, each of us, to our own bit of rock or ship's bottom, and meet all intrusion with the physical axiom that two solids cannot occupy the same space. Our manner of life may be disgusting enough to other people, but what of that t -Po,put'us ?n sibilat, at mihi yplaudo ipse domi. Well, ir aU seriousnem, we should be ready to admit -the hermit system of society, if the " bull" niay be allowed, were it only possible to seal up every member of it hermetically in his own ceL We should not want to peep in. There is a saying which we ahould think likely enough, that if you look close into a hermit's cell you are sure to :find something disagreeable. But what does this signify, so long as the hermit keeps this to himself, ancd presents a decent appearance to the religious world g So, if we could cork him up, - or enclose him in one of the new glass cases, to vegetate for ever on his own earth, air, and water, then we see 'no objection to the grand principle that " Every Englishman's house " is his castle." Indeed, we could name people ,whom we should be delighted to bottle up, and insulate altogether from the outer world. We would not grudge them an atom of liberty,-that is, 'Within their own four wall. But here comes the difficulty, and it is one *entireJy overlooked by the metropolitan philo.sophers 'who took their stand on this grand principle last night against the Bill for the Prevention of Crowding in Lodging-houses. You really annot shut up a nuisance of this sort in a glass case. rhe murder will out. The mortal mass reeks, both morally and physically. You cannot trap it so effectually as to prevent the stench, the malaria, and the nioral miasma from stealing out. The common law of England di!es not permit a nuisance. It does not permit a man to take a room below you in a usually quiet locality and exercise the trade of a tinman, or practise ten hours a-day on the cornopean. It did not permit those ladies at Clapham to disturb the repose of the neighbouring old gentleman with bell-ringing at all the hours prescribed by the Breviary. You may not convert your flor into a fishpond, to the damage of the ceiling below. You may not set up a school for demonstration on the human subject in too close proximity to human dwellin,gs. The law, indeed, goes very far, though the practice lags behind, for in such a metropolis as this the paramount necessity of life does, to a certain extent, prevail over the lesser necessity of health. But there is no doubt as to the law, and the spirit of that law; and they Ijustify any amount of interference where the general health is interested. It is an old maxim, and will stand its ground against the Englishman's house-and-castle theory, that saZs pxpudi sup remas lex esto. Put 463 human beings into 90 beds; put 22 into one small room with a moulderiug corpse, without the means of cleanliness or decency, divest them of all self-respect, and mutual respect, and the mass will fester. In plain Saxon, it wil breed and stink. It ill generate foul air, which wil creep out into the neighbourhood, and poison not only areas and back courts, but the very thoroughfares. The people about, especially the delicate ones, who cannot take much air, and cannot afford a generous diet, will sicken, they know not why. Homebred girls, overworked mothers, seamstresses, and clerks much at deskwork will im'bibe an atmosphere rathermoretainted than usual, and theywill languish and die. Nay, it may come round to you yourself, you full-fed ruffian, with all your beef and port wine, with your grouse aud your claret-jug, and your daily ride in the park. There is no limiting the circuit of that chartered libertine, a pestilential nuisance. Heavens ! how New Palaceyard and the whole time-honoured region of Westminster did stink several days last week! A light airy man could have swum in it, if at all, as high at least as the housetops. The lower stratum was very dense. Do Londoners know the air they live in? The ahepherds of Salisbury Plain nose a gerntleman fresh from town as quickly as they would one of their own sheepfolds. In fact, such a nest as we bave described-and there are scores of " Church-lanes" in this metropolis-is nothing better than an open cesspool, whence all kinds of poisons are continually pouring over the neighbourhood. Do we not restrict the sale of poisons? Then why not put the manufacture of human poisons under proper regulation ? For this purpose it must be open to inspection, and subject to rule. No decent person need fear any -aterference. Decent people don't sleep twenty people in a small room, five or seven in a bed, all ages and sexes, relations or no relations, huddled together. The very nature of the nuisance precludes the abuse of power. But what is to be done? Ask one or two wise ones. Are the redundant members of the human heap to be driven to the Adelphi-arches, or to the parks, the steps, and the doorways, where so many hundreds spend the night already ? We really think a man or a woman had better sleep on the ground, wherever the police would allow it, than one of twenty in a small room. It is better even to catch a cold or the rheumatism than the various plagues tone is likely to catch in such a mass of living dirt as a crowded lodging-house. But that, after all, is a minor diffliculty. We demand, in the interest of the public, for ourselves, and oar children, and for the same reason that we sabscribe to hospitals and pay water and sewer rates, that no people shall be permitted to pollute the air, to generate miasma, and to live in such a way that they must, before 16ng, becdin -a-buders-Dnsociety. WVe have by us some parochial statistics, relating to a comparatively healthy country town, drawn up by a benevolent physician, showing that in the course of a few years a single lodginghouse for tramps had cost the borough several hundred pounds in money, and thrown some twenty or thirty persons permanently on the rates. His estimate was, that it would have been possible to save the whole by a little timely forethought and inspection, at the cost of a few pounds. In fact, then, this is an Englishman's house question. It is a public question. Proximnus ardet. In other words, your neighbour infects the air. You have a right to require that he should be deodorized, at all events, if not himself purified. If we could indeed shut him up in his boasted castle, we could envelope him in cerements, as bees do the putrifying carcass of the pilfering rat they have stung to death; that would be the better course. But we cannot do it. We must proceed by gentler and less effectual methods. We can only secure the nuisance from exceeding a certain high aniount, and compel a few sanitary rules. This is all the Bill in the Commons proposes to do, and it is opposed by the men who consider themselves especially the representatives of the people.
The weary discussion upon the Divorce Bill is still dragging on in the House of Commons, although the Session is so near its termination. Two points were mainly under the consideration of the House yesterday. The first involves the policy of allowing to persons guilty of adultery the right of remarriage; the second is as to whether or not the obligation of celebrating such marriages on the demand of the parties shall be binding upon the clergy of the Church of England. We would offer a few remarks upon each of these matters. Parliament, after solemn discussion, recognizes a principle which it would, indeed, be impossible in presence of the facts to deny--namely, that the practice of England with reference to a breach of the nuptial vow has been that an entire release from the marriage bond shall be granted. The very body, indeed, which granted the divorcewe mean the two Houses of Parliament-have been thus long engaged in a discussion as to the propriety of exercising a power which. they themselves have so long exercised without scruple or. hesitation. This point, however, may be now taken as settled; and furthermore, it may, be added that the settlement rests upon a distinct opinion eutertained by the majority that the granting of such divorces is not in contravention of the Divine law. These points having been ettled, we next approach the veryimportant question, whether the guilty parties shall be allowed to intermarry with each other, or generally to marry again ? The principle hitherto acted upon has been in favour of the permiision. The manner of according this permission has been clumsy enough. First a clause has been thrust into a Divorce Bill contaiLing a veto upon the remarriage. Subsequently this clause has been knocked out, as of course. The grand result of this legislative hocuspor.is has been that the guilty parties were allowed a free exercise of their discretion upon this point. For what reasons, then, are we called upon to retrace our steps' Certainly no direct argument van be adducm from Scripture in favour of such a course; we are therefore dreare to consider the point upon the gro end of public policy5 aided not by pabicular paaages, but by the general spirit, of' the Co~j~eL. .ow, a - Wr sa£e way of twiing the propriety of a particular decision is to trace its probable results. We believe that to leave tl4e law of the country in such a state as that, aided by public opinion, it will practically compel the intermarriage of the guilty parties in, in fact, 'one of the strongest securities we can take against the cdmmission of the offence. We believe that broadly to enunciate the priDciple that the seducer is liberated from the life-long responsibilities of marriage to the seduced will, in effect, be to let loose upon society many libertines who are at present in a certain degree restrained by the necessary consequences of their acts. On the other side it is asked, what will be the result if the precedent permission to intermarry as between the adulterer and adulteress be recognized by the Act now before Parliament? Any husband or wife, it is said, who may be weary of a bond which may have become distasteful will then take a short cut through the slough of adultery to a union which may have at least the unaccustomed charm of novelty. We answer, the right of remarriage has hitherto been part of the anomalous system whicb, for want of a better term, we must call the English Law of Divorce, and no such evil consequences have arisen. If hope of the Divine favour, if sense of duty, if self-resect, if parental affection, and if social consideration are not sufficient to restrain men and women from the commission of the crime of adultery, neither will they be restrained by a simple veto on their intermarriage when the first contract has been dissolved. More than this, when the crime has been completed, and the shame and the sorrow which are its natural results have followed, shall we by a municipal law compel the parties who have been guilty of so heinous an oifence to live on in their sin, nor permit them to offer the poor reparation to society which their degradation admits of ? We are glad to find that the two amendments which embodied the veto, one of which. was introduced by Mr. RoiT, have been defeated, and the power of remarriage remains incorporated with the provisions of the Bill. With regard to the second point, as may be seen by our Parliamentary report of last night, the ATToRNEY-G-NERAL, on the part of the Government, has, with a certain qualification, acquiesced in the amendment proposed by Major WAntnrBToN, and seconded by Mr. WAOPoLE. The terms of Major WARBuRToN's amendment left it actually an open question whether or no an English clergyman was guilty of an offence by reading the marriage service over persons divorced by virtue of the ASt. Thus it ran :-" No priest or deacon shall be liable " to any suit, penalty, or censure for ' solemnizing' "or ' refusing to solemnize' the marriage of any "person who shall be divorced by virtue of "this Act." Whether with reference to the remarriage of the innocent husband or the adulterous wife, or vice versd, mattered not; the point was an open one, upon which the clergyman might exercise his discretion. The qualified amendment of the ATToRNFY-GrinEAL, as settled after some discusaion, is as follows:-"No clergyman in holy orders " of the United Chureh of England and Ireland I " shall be compelled to solemnize the marriage of "any person whose former marriage may have been "dissolved on the ground of his or her adultery, "or shal be liable to any suit, penalty, or censure "for solemnizing, or refusing to solemnize, such "manrage." Under this form of words it is at least clear that only the remarriage of guilty persons is aimed at; but still it must be remembered that when we concede to the clergy the right of disregarding thee law at their pleasure, we are, in fact, reintroducing the principle of a tyranny intolerable to our forefathers. The supremacy of the CRoWN is either a fact or a delusion. If the clergy accept the advantages of the obligation they must also be prepared to accept its drawbacks, one of which is obedience to the Law. When they took holy orders they were well aware that this obeAience was requnred of themn, but now upoil one.' point they miay at {E-tll `o0bnr-vPtr refuse it, and practically deny the supremacy of the CRoww. This is no light matter; it is, in fact, a point of far more momentous import than any :which has yet been introduced into the discumion. The British Parliament says, " This is the law of Englandd ;" any private clergyman may, if this amendment be adopted, I say, "1 This is the law of England, but I will set " it at defiance." Nor can they even urge the poor palliation that they have been taken unawares, that their consciences have been entrapped, that they have fallen into a snare. The practice of England has been to consider persons divorced a zinoulo absolutely as single persons, and as such they have asked for and obtained the solemnization of their second marriage as a right. It mattered not whether under the old system two persons or two hundred persons were annually divorced. Any clergyman might have been called upon to solemnize the marriage of the two. He wil now have to exercise an opition, and may, if he chooses to exercise the power thus unwisely given him, rofuse. We confess that we cannot see without the greatest dismay this introduction of the principle that the clergy may, at their pleasure, disregard the law of the land.
While the unemployed politicians of Paris are for the twentieth time prophesying the decline of English greatness, a juster appreciation of the Indian crisis seems to prevail in the United States. Amaericans and Englishmen in their reciprocal judgments of each other enjoy the not inconsiderable advantage of possessing in themselves a tolerably accurate standard of reference. The subject or citizen of either country is conscious that a rulincg race is not easily dispossessed of an ancient dominion. The suppression of a Seminole war or of a Mexican insurrection in California would be anticipated from one end of the Union to the other as an inevitable event, and it is understood, therefore, that the more serious undertaidng of reducing the revolted Sepoys is only a question of time and of expense. The work may- be difficult and tedious, but those who understand the English character can never doubt that it will be done. Demonstrations of the necessity of our failure may be left to the epigramnatic syllogisms of continental saloons. A nation which is unanimous seldom fails, and the universal concert whieh prevails is. only disturbed by an involuntary humourist, who, in the person of Mir. UJuXmJXAuT, invokes success " on the arms "of the subjects of E:R MAJESTY in India against "the insurgent, rebellious, and traitorous Go- 'vernors-General, who by one and the same blow "have driven loyal men into insurrection, used -fthe QuEEN's forces in an attempt to destroy "them, violated the honour of this land, and "broken through the enactments of Parliamen4." Americans know by experience that the license accorded to maniacal nonsense indicates the fearless strength of a free people. The good owill towarda England which is exhibited by the American press is more gratifying, and perhaps more umxpected than the sound judgment which has generally been formed of the probable result of the insurrection. One New York journal of largp circulation actually recomnmends us to recruib for the Indian Army within the limits of the Uihion. On certain conditions it is said, "them. might doubtless be awakened a "strong feelibg:here in favour. of£ the British in India, ariltveryhlikely, witfpxoper measure3 ani "a suital:.out1c4, 5O,O&n.iae.could be enlistel "in a f v weel" It.. %i upt. very likely that Lord CLIxMqDoN will give the District Attorneys of I Ps.ynJva&iia apd New York any fresh opportunity of . displaying their indignant eloquence against the eneroachments of the English Minister. It-i posible, also, that some objection might be felt to the pabification of Bengal through the agency of 50,OOO free and enlightened citizens. The Qu's subjects who are now in arms on behalf of the. King of DELHI sufficiently illusttate for the present the inconvenience of a divided allegiance. But the friendly spirit which dictates the suggestion imiay be noticed and valued, although the offe-r of an army of auxiliaries is undoubtedly a mere rhetorical flourish. The history of the Anglo-Indian Empire, especiaLy in the earlier stages of its growth, may not unnaturally attract American sympathy to its founders, and to their successors. Cuvu and his contemporaries may easily be regarded as Filibusters on a magnificent scale. HAUSTIGS and WmLLESraY, though they might not pro- fess the doctrine, carried out the decrees of " Manifest Destiny" with unexampled vigour. The Democrats of the Western World are the firmest of all believers in the aristocracy of races, and especially of their own. When they believe that a half-breed Spaniard of Nicaragua is equal to an American irom the Union they may sympathize in the pretensions of Hindoos and Mussulmans to shake off the supremacy of Europeans. Even the errors of English rulers have not in general been such as to offend ordinary Amerian prejudiesa. Disregard for native oustoms, and contempt for pernicious usages and for strange religions, are at least as characteristic of the United States as of the mother country. The inhabitants of the Atlantic cities naturally look with interest to the commercial questions involved ih the result of- the present strugglb. Notwithstanding real and alleged shortcomings, it is known that the English Government has done much to promote the material welfare of its Eastern dominions. The traders of New York require no theoretical economist to teach them that a eivilized, and orderly community will be a better customer than a cluster of barbarian States under rival and warlike chiefs. The commerce of the American Union with India admits of no vast increase, but the extension of railways and the increase of wealth among the inhabitants are likely constantly to furnish new sources of profit. The nation which posseses the largest mercantile navy in the world is most deeply interested in the maintenance and multiplication of profitable markets. Even the slaveholders of the South abstain from triumphinag over the interruption of a rival industry in the task of producing cotton and sugar. Their organs are contented with the new illustration of their melaneholy doctrine that philanthropy is under all circumstances mischievous and wrong. The infidels of Franee, it is said, and the fanatics of England have reduced the West Indies to a desert, and now a mistaken zeal for Christianity endangers the cause of order and of progress in the East. "The momentous conse"quences likely to result from the rebellion in "India can only be justly appreciated when viewed "in connexion with the deficient supply of slave 'produce which now ' perplexes nations." The inference that slavery ought by all possible means to be encouraged is drawn for domestic use, but we have no reason to complain of a judgment which, if gloomy, is not unsympathetic. The friendly feeling entertained towards England is the more trustworthy -because it is thoroughly intelligible. It has always been difficult to comprehend the irritation which has so frequently embittered the differences between two kindred nations. The more rational opinions which have found expression on the present occasion are founded on reasons which cannot be explained away. Foreigners may be excused for underrating the pover *hich would still remain to England if her Indiau aominion were at an ed. The- streng a.nd rigour which have reduectih- lionrofthie East to subjection would continue to exist even if they were exerted in some other direction; but it is natural that the Indian crisis should appear to the world to be absolutely vital to Enghind. The sober judgment of the United States; however, deprecates the supposed decline of our national prosperity and greatness. " Beides," it is said, " being "our best customer and our closest commercial ally, "England stands in a position that is peculiarly "intereating to us, as the head and home of "liberty in Europe. England is the only country "in Europe where speech, thought, the press, and "action are free." Other journals express even more strongly a feeling which, on the part of English writers, might be attributed to extravagant and uneasoning patriotism. It is not too much to say that an equally cordial sentiment would be entertained on this side the Atlantic if the United States were menaced with any serious danger. The gratifying change which has taken place in this respect since the time of the Rusian War may be, in part, attributed to the progress which has been made in removing the Central American difficulties. It is true that the treaty negotiated by LIr. DArAs has not yet been concluded, but the principles of an arrangement are recognized on both sides, and it is certain that the terms which were oriinally proposed will ultimately form the basis of a settlement. The only English interest in the disputed regions concerns the free passage of the Isthmus. The half-civilized States of the American Continent may be left without interference on oifr part to adjust their future relations with their formidable neighbonr. The world is wide enough for both branches of the race to spread without collision or interference. With India to govern and Australia to cultivate, Englishmen may look without jealousy or regret on the progress of the American Union towards the Southern Continent.

ThE troops in "mp are ordered to be under arms at an earln hour for a grand field day. His Royal Highness the General Commanding in Cluel will hold A levee at 1 o'olock on Friday next. Major-General Sir Frederick Love, the Inspector-General of Infantry, has left towu on an official visit to Pembroke. The 44th Regiment, being on the eve of embarcation for India, were yesterday presentod with new colours by Major-General the Ron. Sir James Yorke Scarlett, K-CB., the Commander-iu Chief of the South-West District, at Portsmouth. The usual ceremonies having been gone through, of piling the draums, placing the colours, and blessing or conseora'ing them by the garribon chaplsin of Portsmouth, the Rev. T. Milner, Major-General Scarlett dtlivered the new colours to the senior majors (Lieutenant. C. lonels 'WMahon and Browne), and addressed the regiment in a most soldierly speech, showing that the oolours of a regiment mark its identity, and that those of the 44th, emblazoned as they are with the names of the memorable victories of "Egypt," "Badajoz," "Slamanca," "Peninsula," "Bladensburg," "Waterloo," "A,," "Alma," "Inkernann," and " Sebutopol," bore honours no regiment could outvie; that they had gone through many hardships n rs y places, and the names on their colours called up many reeollections to their honour and credit; their conduct at Quatre Bras and Cabul was unexceptionable, and at Alma glorious; at the fermer action the bravery of Ensign Christie saved the old colours, and at the latter the selfsacrifice or devotion of Dr. Thompson was unparallelled * in their athak on the cemetery before Sebastopol on the 18th of Jnne, the 44th Foot lost four captains ont of six, and one-fourth of the men; they were now about to embark for India, where he hoped sucoess and victory would still be enchained to their standard, feeling certain that under no cirumstances would they fail to defend them. The gallant general then feelingly touched upon the deaths of Captains Mansfield, Agar, Fenwick, and Caulfield in the Crimea, and Ensign Souter, in the retreat from Cabal, and concluded a spirited and martl address by a hope that the 44th would preserve the honours rttheuld colours, and-eap-new-di sintions under tLos"Lathen presented. Lieutenant-Colonel Stavely, C.B, then returned thanks in a short speech, and the oolours having been trooped in the usual manner the 6lite on the field adjourned to a superb refection prepared in the Ming's Rooms adjacent, by Mr. Digby Dent, of the Portland Hotel, Southsea. After this dancing was commnenced and kept up until night set in. The Lords of the Admiralty rsumed their annual inspection at Portemouth yesterday, and went first tothegunboat berths at Hadlr, where they made a most minute inspection, Mr. Iloyd and Mr. Scamp pointing out (under the direction of Colonel Greene) the new works, improvements, working, and requirements. The gunboat Brave was launched in the presence of the Board, amd numerous suggestions made for the permanent benefit of this gunboatreserve establishment. While on the Gosport shore their Lordshipe inspected officially the Royal Marine Light Infantry quartared at Forton-barracks, the Royal Clrenceo yard, and the Royal Naval Hospital at Haslar, both the latter establishments under the superintendence of Captain Dacres, C.B, R.N. From the Clarence-yard the Board embarked in their barge, aud inspected and mustered the steam reserve on board the Blenheim, in the command of Captain the Hon. F. T. Pelham, C. B., and thence to the gunnery-ship Exeellent, Captain R. Hewlett, C.B. In the evening they dined with Rear-Admi-al Martin, Superintendent of the dockyard. The Falcon, 17, Commander Campion, is dismantling in Portamouth harbour, to be paid off. The Pylades, 21, Captain Michael De Couroy, left Portsmouth harbour yesterday, and anchored at Spithead.

RECBUITING FROM MILITIA REGIMEXTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES& Sir,-I am very glad to-se ainJ 2 1 inVof the 15th t Lord Pnmure, in anawering lord Ellenborouglh, admits the neceasity of keeping up = certain eprit de berps is militia regiments, insead of using them ms rerwitipg patiese and that in the most objectioable mnner, aa was the case during the late war. I - I am quite convinced that no county gentlemen will eOtiUne in the militia if they are to have all authority taken out of their hands whenever it is convenient to send a party of the roughest material to get volunteers from the regiment. When those gentlemen decline any longer to Woin the militia it must be offioered by officers on hilf-pay, or e tired, and gentlemen having little or no connexion with the county, as is even now vqry much the cse, and, eons. quently, with no inrluence in obtaining men, or over them afterwards, and little interest in the regiment beyond drawing their pay. The militia will then cesoe to be the militi it in most desirable it should be. Iwould suggest that each line regiment should look to. particular militia regiment, whether embodied or not, to provide it withmen,-also taldng those who might offer at their head-quarters or depot; the commander of the line would take a pride in sending good non-commisiconed offioers to the militia when they had served their ime, and the commanding offler of militia and every officer in it would take a pride in sending good men to the line, whose career while on active service could be tracaed, and they again, at the expiration of their service, would return to 'heir oounty and the Faff of the militia, having gained honour and a fair name without actually separting from the playfellows and neighbours of their youth. I believe, tnder such an errangemeat, that the militia would be better offloered and disciplinp$, on acoouut of the superiority of the non-commissioned offioers and men, the it has ever been, and the army immensely improved; nor would there be any necessity for an increased bounty, which, I am sure, would only teDd to bring worse men to the ranks and hold out a greater temptation to desert them, I vemina. kc-.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGENBE. FRA-CE. (FRoM OUR OWN OORrSONDXNTA. tA pertion of the following appeaed in #r secoad edi. &IA h. Ai- ^_ I_ VAU15, MONDAY, AUGUST 1?, 6P-M I am assured that despatehes have been received from Vienna announcing that the Austrian Government agrees to the proposition made by France, and accepted by England, with regard to the elections in Moldavia and with the understanding that the French aovernment requires that these elections shall be legally conducted. The Marquis de Moustier is tobe appointed French Ambassador to the Court of St. Petersburg, and will be succeeded at Berlin by the Duke de Grammont, now at Turin. Accounts from Stockholm state that thephysicians have lost nkearly aU hope of the re-establahanent of King Oscar's health. There was no exaggeration in what the Minister of State said on Friday last at the inauguration of the Louvre with regard to the embellishment of Paris during the last five years;-the Rue de Rivoli, connecting two oppo3ite and distant quarters of Paris in one unbroken sweep, letting in air, light, and health where, not long since, was a labyrinth of dark alleys and lanes, the abodes of disese and crime; the Boulevard de Strasbourg and that of Sebastopol, which will open between the quays and the Boulevards; and then the Louvre, completed within so short a space of time that it seems only yesterday the Emperor laid it3 first stone. It cannot, it is true, be said that the Imperial Government found Paris a city of mud and left it of marble; but the changes Paris has uandergone since 1852, amid difficulties of many k-inds, with war, pestilence, a sucession of deficient harvests and destructive txulndati3nz, will certainly place the Emperor's name high among those to whom Paris owes its architectural grandeur. Not the least remsxrable of those improvements is the transformation whichhas been effected in the Bois de Boulogne. Those who have frequented that well-known resort have not forgotten what the Bois de Boulogne was some four or five years ago,-for the greater part a desert of gravel and dust, with weak and sickly vegetation, an infected marsh, alleys which had no egress, stunted brushwood, here and there a patch of grass trodden out of aU life and colour, the ground strewan over with loose pebbles, the earth parched, inaccessible paths bardly ever visited by pasmengers, or even the police, and become the resort of duellists, and thoms stark, spectre-like poles, misnamed trees, with dry and lesafess branches, wvhere the ruined gambler, the maddened spendthrift, or the wretch vhom crime or msisfortune had made tweary of the world, put an end to his existence. The dismal aspect of the place imparted a sil more sombre hue to the sorrows of the aafficted and the melancholy of the misanthrope. All this is changed. Instead of those dreary plains you have now fresh and verdant glades, velvet lawna, trees iich with soft and abundant foliage, springs fresh, gushing, and limpid, and picturesque hillocks. With its small lake, its islets, its groves, and shrubs, its grottoes, kiosks, streams, and verdure, the uew Bois de Boulogne Seems like an oasis 'which has sprung up as if by enchantment in the desert. The Pre Catalan is a spot unique of its kind. About a year and a half ago a concession was made by the municipality of Paris of a few acres of arid and sandy soil in the Bois de Boulogne to a X Ber, on a lease of 40 years. This enterorising individual lost no time; he set a number of persons to work levelling the ground, transporting earth, and planting. A legion of garden labourers were employed in clearing away the brush wood and shrubs, and in sowing and plaatig, aing out lawns and flower-beds, and raising hilocks; 8,000 trees formed the enclosure, and with their foliage afforded an agreeable shade in the interior of this improvised park. Chestnut trees by hundreds were transplanted from dietant spots, and set in clusters, each encircled with banks of violets and hedges of rosetrees. The originl concession wassubsequently enlarged, and the Pr6 Catalan has now its gardens, its theatres (in some of which performances take place in the open air), its kiosks and challets, its rustic temples, its waterfalls, cafes, restaurants, concert-rooms, electric telegraph for the amusement of promenaders, and even its photographic machines, where you can have your portrait taken without interrupting your walk or Your amusements. With such attracetions, wvhere everr booSv is appealeta to, and which combine artisticaly the useful with the beautiful, it is no wonder if the Bois de Boulogne has become more than ever the resort to which aU repair to inhale the delicious coolness of the summer twilight after the confined and sultry atmosphere of a noisy city. Among the improvements wvhich Paris hasundergone since the establishnient of the Imperial -&jime there is none that ought to be nore truly appreciated than this nevw " Vale of Cashmere," which you find embosomed in the Bois de Boulogne. At I o'clock yesterday the Emperor distributed the commemorative medal granted to the soldiers and seamen who served in the French army and navy from 1792 to 1815, to Prince Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, Marshal Vaillant (Ainister of War), Admiral Hamelin (Minister of AMarine), Marshals dagn an and Baraguay d'HiiUiers, Admiral Parseval Deschenes, the Duke de Plaisance (Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour), Count Ornano (Governor of the Invalides), and several Generals and Admirals. Despatches from Algiers of the 14th inst. announce that the works of Fort Napoleon were continued with great activity. Kabylia wan tranquil; the administration was being organized. Officers were enabled to ride through the country without an escort. They were everywhere well received, and the population, not long since so hostile, had become accustomed to the French occupation. Private letters of the 13th inst. from Madrid say that many there pretend that, although the Spanish Government has accepted the mediation of England and France in the quarrel with Mexico, it will not suffer the imposition of such terms or conditions as itself would not have voluntarily admitted. Persons who are i4 frequent intercourse with Narvaez declare that expressions of this kind are continually in his mouth. His object is perhaps to calm down any dissatisfaction that may have been roused in Spain by the deference shown to the wishes of France and Engand. If he puts forward aud propagates such insiauations with the idea that they will have weight with the mediating Powers, he is greatly mis-aken. Spain will not go to war with Mexico, because she cannot; she lacks money, and she fears for Cuba. She will have to content herself with the satisfaction awarded to her by tTreat Britain and France, which will doubtless be all that she is in justice entitled to, but which will hardly come up to her recent extravagant pretensions. The Narvaez Cabinet is firm in office for the present. Other Governments there might be which the Palace would prefer, but none of them arepossible for the mooment; and even the enemies of the Ministry abatain from harassing it, because they do not feel themselves atrong enough, either separately or collectively, to overthrow it. As to militarv insurrecions, note are likely to occur; against these Narvaez Is much stronger than Sartotius was; he can reck-on better on the army, and, moreover, s the French say, " Wolves do not eat each other." The advent to office of Gonzales Bravo is no longer talked about, and the hoped-for settlement of the coupon question, which was considered to be in oome degree contingent on that event, again seems postponed. General Larsun.di will be the next Captain General of Cuba notwithstandingaLa reports to the contrary, and tWose wvho know him best predict that it is not under his rule that a stop will Pa put to the slave trade. S0ome few manufacturers in Paris, who have obtained a high reputation for their produce, are actively employed, while trade in general is duLL The m111=tctirers to whom I allude have received lazge ordersrom COnstantinople, Italy, and Spain for oosty furuiture and expensive trimmings, but others ae nearly i.e. The ditliculty of obtaining dwoDunt -ik ew*. crippled the resources of the aninor mercantile houses. Strange to say, the insurrection in India is said to have thrown discredit on English paper in Paris, and to hays thus caused an additional embarrassment. The ancy shops in Paris are doing a good business, in eonsequence of the great indux of strangers who come to Paris to see the improvements, and who are induied by the fineness of the weather to puschase additional summer dresss. Trade is said to be brisk at Rouen, but dull at Mulhouse. The mufaturers of Lyons are stiU waiting for their lobg-expected orders. The inhabitants of Paris are delighted that the butchers' monopoly is to be abo- bed, aad tht free trade in butchers' meat is to be declared. The establishmeut of a cenistl Market for the sale of live cattle is likew decided on, and it is believed that the construction of this mirket will be confided to a company which has presented plans and made propos313 to the city of Paris; but, as it will require at least a year to make all the necessary arrangement3, the existing markets will in the meantime continue supplying the capital. Everybody is impatient to see the effect that will be produced by d bi g the butchers' trade perfectly free. The establishment of Transatlantic packetboats is about to be conceded. The Brazil line, for which a subventionl of 3,500,000f. is to be granted, will be divided betwveenl the citie3 of Bordeaux and Marseilles, so that there will be two departures each month. It is said that Arruand and Co. are to have the line from Bordeaux, and Touache and Co. the line from Marseilles. The port of Havre is to establish a Line with the United Statas, with a subvention of 3,100i,OOf. The city of Nantes has obtained the line with the West Indies, with a subvention of 6,200,000f. Wheat and flour continue to decline in the Paris market. Three hundred and ixty sacks of flotr were sold on Friday for delivery at an average of 66f. 85c. the sack of 157 kilogramines. There remain 7,478 quintals in the market stores. The price of wheat is kept up with more difficulty than that of flour. There was scarcely any businesstransacted last week, the millers refusing to bay except at a reduction of 30 sons Sthe hectolitre. Samples of new wheat from Angers -were offered at 37f. per 120 kilograimm6s, buti could not find buyers at above 35f. The markrets inthe departments areI in general well supplied, and prices are fali. The rain duning last week was general, but not sufficient to set the flour-mills going. The bakers, nevertheless, succeeded in obtaining a reduction of one franc per saok on flour as compared with last week. Amounts from the provinces are unanimous in desribing the produce of the wheat crop as extraordinary. Certain localities had sown a greater breadth of land than usual, and will have a crop and a half. It is calculated that each department in France will feed itself without having occasion to buy corn in foreign markets. The result is already visible in the diminution of the receipts I of the various railway companies. Last year these railways carried an enormous quantity of foroign and home-grown wheat from the northern to i the southern departments. Theprice o swine iswell maintained at Bercy, notwithstanding t4ekather is i most favourable for the vineyards. T]r6 accounts a from Burgundy and Maconnaim are excellent. It is expected that the vintage in those districts will be most satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality; but in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux the oidium has caused great damage where the use of sulphur was neglected, aud some vineyards will not produce more than onv-fourth or one-fifth of an ordinary crop. The wfhite grapes at La Flotte are most abundant, and white wine has fallen from 150f. to 120f. the tun of 220 gallons. The price of meat for the second foetnight of the present month is fixed as follows:-Ox beef, 1st class, If. 38c. the kilogramme; 2d, If. 48c.; 3d, iL 8c.; 4th, 77c. (all 4c. ower).

PRUSSIA. The Berlin Zeit makes the following reply to the violent attacks made by the Austrian journals upon the policy of Prussia, more especially as regards the question of the Danubian Principalities:- "A portior of the Austrian press, espeoially the OstDeuische Post, attackg In so unbecomoing a mnanner the Prussian Cabinet, because it has demanded the annulling of the elections in Moldavia, and broken off its diplomatic relations 'with the Porte,that we deem it beneath the honour of Prussia to reply. In our opinion all that Prussia has to do is consientiously to examine the arguments of her adver-. saries; we have no ears to listen to the violent outbursts of their anger. " Prussia, as a great Power, follows her own line of polcy to-day, as she did during the war in the East. Let them get accustomed to this at Vierma in tme, and let them not, even in appearance, underrate the importance of the Prnsslan relo a tious. It is only by consultg reciprocal interests that a guarantee for barmony can be obtained. England having, as is known, adhered to the policy of the united Governments, the Ausrin journals will, doabtless, in a few days receive orders to change their tone, so as not to renider still more difficult the position of the Cabinet of Vienna, which will scary make an attempt to prevent the annulling of the elections in Moldavia."
THE PTUBLIC B.ALTB. (From the BReir.rGnerals weekly retur) Tho deaths registered in London in the week that ended on Saturday (August 15) were 1,187, and exhibit a decrease on those returaed in the three previous weeks, when they ranged from 1,209 to 1,238. I the 10 years 1847.56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,265. Bat the deaths of last week occaured in an increased population, and to admit of comparison the average should be raised in proportion to the increase, inwhich cas it will become 1,380. The average rate of mortality would have produced more deaths by 193 thAn the number in the present return ; but It Is proper to state that, as that rate is derived In part from periods when cholera raged, it is too high as a measure of health when the popula. tion is happily free from such calamity, and that the mortality from all causes at the present time differs little from the ordinary amount at this season of the year. The deaths from diarrhcea, 'which rapidly rose to 302 in the last week of July, and in the next week declined to 258, again exhibit a slight decrease, the number returned last week being 244. In the ten weeks (of 1847-56) corresponding with last week the deaths from this complaint ranged from 81 to 253. The London registers during the laS 12 years reveal a very strildng increase in the pre. valence of diarrhoaa, for on referring to the retrns for the second or third week of August In 1840-45 it will be seen that the numberof casesin hich it w fatalwas as low a3 20 or A1 and did not exceed 70, Besides the deaths from dlarrhom there were 21 ast week from "eholera" a "l w,. leraic diarrhea," 12 of whioh ocurred to ydung childrer. The registrar of the sub-ditrict of Woolwich Arsenaa reports a death from "English ebolera" ifter au illess of 40 hours. The doeased was a rige in the dockyard, and had been employed for several days in raising the convicb hulk Defence, and it apper that he suffered extremely from what wa8 descrOied by him an " the awful stench" of the river during the psrformante of hIa work. Last weok the births of 875 boys and 743girls in all 1,618 cbildren, were registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of they 1847-56 the average number was 1,448. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwicb, the mean helght of the barometer in the weok was 29193 I. The highest reading in the week was 30 in. on Wedno8tay. The mean temperature of the week wa 6317 deg., which is 21 deg. above the average of the same week In 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher.)

I THE INDIAN MU?TINIES, We con'tinue to give extracts from the Iudian letters which reach us. The following is from Tirhoot, dated June 26: "The rgimenta above Dl)napore at every station but Ghazeporohavemutinied or been disarmed, and a row at the former place has been expected every day, so that our station authorities got funked, and on the 14th of this month we were all sumLamoaned into the station for mutna protection. Every planter waa in, and we mustered. EO sirong, besides the ladies. The latter were all put up in M. Simpson's housa, and we slept in tents in the com. pound. Mr. Macdonell, of Poosa, aid a few others, stayed at the AsistantSudge's. What fiunked the station fo k ws that they had seven lacs of treasuro there, and the Nujjeebs had been heard to deolare treason openly, and only waited for an outbreak at Dinapore. Davies, disguised as a native, went at night to their quarters, and overhearl them say they would make a clean sweep of the Europeans, loot the treasure, and let loose the gaol prisoners in a very few days. Tbis put the station people in a very grea. way. " The Dinapore regiments are Ikept in awe by the Euro pewas, there being some 1,200 there, including artillerymen; but for this force we ehould certainly have had a row, and taen Tirhoot would have been in a blaze, and our factories burat, as the Benaes factories were. Poor - up tho:e is rened, and just oscaped with his life; we returned from Moozufferpoor this morning for good, as it is now supposed all danger is over. I took a run down during the ten day, we were at the station, much against the wish and advics of the sttion folk, and, found everything quiet. Our leaving the factories had a bad effect; but what oou'd we do when everybody was so perenmptorily summoned in and everybody went ? Martial law has been declaced throughout the district, and Holmes, at Segowley, is hang. ing right and lef, mosly Sepoys, returned from the scene of action ladeh with booty. A few arests have been made in Iooztfferpoor among ihe M ssulmas, and one fat Tha nadar, witL a lot of matinous correspondence, has beea seized and sent In to Segowlee ; he is probably hanged by this time. Arrests have also been made In the Dehaut, principally about Lolgunge Singhia, of return Sepoys. Those that belong to the insurgent regiments -will be hanged unles they are away on leave. This has had a very salutary effect, and the Diggere in a great funk." Another account dated Tirhoot, June 28, says," On the 14th and 15th clreulars were sent to al the planters, calling them to the statiou for mutuni safety, and were signed by the judge, additional judg-, and collector, but before this was sent out - wal celled upon by these persons to use his influence to collect as many as he could, but he did not consider it advisable that persons should leave their factories as there was little known in the Dehaut abon the mutinies, and he was afraid of the niggeci taidng advantage of any panic, and perhaps burning ani plundering the factories, Ue therefore wrote beggin that the planters should not be called in, and stating his reasons; but the offidals get into a funk and sent out thia circular All from this end of the district flocked in here, and we went up to the statiorn together, all armed to the teeth (16 of us and two ladles), having been written to that the Nujjeebs, of whom there are 120, were ready to plunder the treasury and murder all hands. We found all quiet, went to the judge, and requested that he would empower us to disarm the Nujjeebs, but he would not take the responsibiity; - then told him ho v wrong he was in alarming the district if he did no: iutend to act. I believe it is luoky we did go to the station, for by all accounts the treasury would hase been looted) but for the presence of so maoy Europeans, and iu such case the effect upon the Dehaut might have led to seriousconsequenoes. There were some 86 men and 30 ladies, with 30 or 40 children, assembled, all of whom, with the exceptiou of si cr eight, quartered in Dr. Simpson's and Weston's houses, the ladies being all shut up in the former at night and the gentlemen livlng in the verandas, one or two tents, aad patrolling all night, Youn may imagine how they must have suffered, the heat being something frightful the whole time. " All of the planters have gone home, but the ladies are all at the station or its vicinity; though I think and hope that the danger has passed, although we have not yet heard of the fall of Delhi, but the latest accounts stated that a portion of the walls was battered down, the mutineers in a l awful funk, and the King ready to throw himself upon the mercy andprotection of the English; but if they don't string the brute up they deserve to loss the country. The plot wa s a deep one, and must bAve been going on for yeas; all th i k!5hommedans had a hand in it, the men in Government employ takdng the lead. 's WA -4--a - Thanadaar brute a few days ago who was In league with the conspirators ; he was finihing a letter to; a Patna obief, and would have decamped in another hour ; he was sent to Holmes to Segowloe,who has proclaimed mar tial law, and is stringing the fellows up like a ' brick.' "T The Chaina trops have reached the Sandheads, and others are not far off, so that quiet must soon be restored over the country, but we have had a butch (escape) o it, and I am of opinion that the cartridges hurried the outbreak before all was matured and have ssved us all, for had things been so concerted as for all the native regiraenti to have risen at once there were no means at hand to cheoc them. All were in the plot, and not one regiment would have remained faithful; as it is, one half of the army is gone, all communication from above Allahabad Is closed, and evon this far has only been re-opened the last few days. It's extraordinary how they have been kept down at Dina pore, where they have been disaffected for some time, bu: the old General is a good man and was prepared to mnake good account of them had they mutinied. I don't beHeve any of the Meerm' mutineers would hsve reached Delhi had there been an active man in command, for the European troops outnumbered the natives. "Venables (a planter) at Azimghur Is at the head of 150 soldiers (natives), and doing good service in the disturbed villages. Hle has hung a lot of rebels, and had sent an indent for 20 new ropes a few days ago. The newspapers will give you later news." The following letter is from an officer who miraculously escaped with his wife and children fromn the massacre of Delhi : " RIERUT, JTuN 25. "We are still at Meerut, in our small fortified position. Our force consists of a part of the 60th Rifles and 6thDra. goon Guards, with artillery and vfolunteers; in all about 800 men-not a large force, certainly, for these times, consider ing our proximity to Delhi (only 38miles), but large enough, we hope, for the purposes required. Since I last wrote the whole of the Bareily troops have revolted, and are now encamped at Ghurmuktelr (28 miles hence). They have given out their intention of paying us a visit, but we are all getting ready to receive them most warmly, and, although they are reported to be about 3,500 stroug, we are quite confident of the result. Y'u w!llprobablyhaveseen an accountin thepapers of the inurretions at Bareilly and Shabjebanpore. They are dreadful accounts; the residents at the latter place were aU massacred during ohurch service, at least only two officers are said to have escaped. Our army is still before Delhi; the rebels are fighting like fiends, and daily attack our position; but are always beaten off with loss to themselves, and not much to us. They are waiting reinforcements before the assault takes place. I fear Delhi wil not fall without a great sscrifLce of valuable life, as the place is strong and well defended by at least 14,000 msui of our mutinouscorps, and we have comparativaly a small force. Our con. xnunicationsarecutofffrom Agra, Cawnpore, Lucknow, and all st*tions east of this. We aranxiously.looldng out fortheatrivalof European regiments from (aloutta, as everal mlust be well up country by this time, but none as yet have been heard of. A part of the 4th Cavalry are here. A; guard of 40 troopers were sent towards Delhi on some duty or other, and more than half went over to the enemy. - i hare, and - at UUmballah. I would advise them to keep their eyes open, for thwe are otrange times, and no natives can be tusted. I only wsh I could get dear - and the children to the Hills, btut tnere is no stirring into the district; the whole country is up between this sad Mvasoorie. We heard yesterday that a pat of the 4th Iregular Cavalry had mur dered thelr officers at Mozuffernuggur (near this) and had left for the Imperil city, where God grant they may come in for the retribution they so richly deserve. I can fancy the commotion all this wfil cause in England. I hope they will send out some 20,000 men immediately. "Jane 26.-News reached us last night of there having been a hard fight before Delhi on the 23d. It lasted from sunrise tillsunset. The enemy were repulsed with considerable loss. It seems to be hard work for our troops, for these sorties take place sometimes twice a-day, and the 'exposare to the sun knocks many up. The siege is not progreasing so satisfactorily as we expected, partly owing to the heavy ordnance we have made the rebels a prevent oF, our guns being of less calibre thaa theirs, and consequently there is no silencing their fire. Reinforcements are now pouring in I am glad to say on our side, and the rebels I hear are getting disheartened at their repeated defeats, but my opinion is they will stand to the Last, as they are aU fhting with halters round their necks, and will of cotr o sell their lives as dealy as posaible. Our poor brother is in the thick of it, but has as yet, thank God, escaped. We are all living huddled up together in barrcks and teatsnet very oomfortble as you may imagine, but as yet are healthy-ladie3, children, and all; but these mre uot timeo to have ladies with us, and we would give a good deal to send them to a safe place, bat they cannot ileaveleertatpreieet. lMy poor ittle bairns! it makes Ime quite sad to see them In such a aituation; not that they ar aware of the danger, bat are as merry as ever, poor little souls I They cause we mueh anxiety and distress. If they were in England, oh, what a reHef it would be to my mind." THE RtIMOIIRED MASSACRE OF FUGITIES FROM FUTTEHGHUR. We have received the following letter respecting this frightful story. We can only hope that the writer's doubts may be well-founded:- ccIu a leader in your isue of the 14th ilnst. this rumour is alluded to as a fact. Thus recognized, and relating as it does to the murder of 130 of our countrymen, the rumonr must cause intense anxiety to very many families on this side. " Allow mo, iterefore, to 'now that there are strong reasons for beHieving that the report, if not purely a abrication, will prove to be a gross exaggeration of atrocities on a smaller scale for which the Rajah of Bithoor may have to answer. "s In a letter which I have received from Caloutta, dated July 4, and of which I subjoin an extract, the writer states his positive disbelief of the ramonred massacre, and only admits the bare possibility of such an event. There is every reason to accept as correct his information, that up to the 20th or 21stof June everything remained quiet at Fattehghuy. Now, if this be tre, the report must be false. Futtehghur is 90 miles above Cawupore, and the latter place is l15 miles above Allahabad, where the rumour was first beard of on the 23d of June. Those who know anything of the rate at which the nastive river craft move will allow at least two or three days frosa Futtehghur to Cawnpore, even if the boats prooeed singly, and nearly double that time for a fleet of S0 boats keeping together, whioh is implied in the umouLr. If the boats proceeded separately, some out of so many must have escaped If they went in a fleet, which is almost impossible, they could not have been at Cawnpore even on the 23d of June, the date of the ramour at Allahabad; while two days at leaut may be allowed for intellgence reaching the latter place from Cawnpore, especially when there was no posl communication. ,- There are other cormstnces which throw discredit on the report, The revolted Sepoys at Puttehghur committed no violence, but only deserted their serviCe, and marched for Delhi. This renders it wholly improbable that the Europeans there should all have been seized by a causeless panic, which, according to the ;Iecd of rhdia, occasioned their ight. Up to the 4th of July the authorities in CalCoutta had no information of the alleged slaughter at Cawnpore. So late as the DsA of July General Havelock reporkd from Allah4.bad, " Etawah and Futtehghur safe in our hands " and, had such a frightful crime been perpetrated at Cawnpore a week previously, he must have known of it. Then, may it not be held that my correspondent's informntion, obtained through the best native channels up to the 4th of July in Calcutta, is entitled to a preference over the accounts which the R lshmn, and othe Calcutta papers had received nearly a week before ? In these accounts there is one particular so inaccurate as to affect the credibility of the whole story. It is stated that the fugitives were attacked at Bithoor (Bhitoor in the report), landed and dragged to the Parade-ground at Cawnpore, &c. iow, Bithoor is 12 milee above Cawnpore. " The verslon given in the Phknis of the 30th of Jnue seems to indicate the origin of all these frightful rumours. We are told that a Ghomatah, writing from Allahabad stated that he had left Cawnpore on the 18th of June, and reported that "the Mabratta chief of Bithoor and other rebels had put to death nearly 200 Europeans, including above 100 fugitives from, as he says, NyneeTal" Now, it is quite probablethatthe Ghomaatah's report may be so far true that the Bithoor Chief may have put to death some unfortanate Europeans who may have fallen within his power. This wouid be foundatlon enough for the tale of horror, which, according to the Bombay limes, was first brulted at Allaha. bad on the 23d of June, which would be about the probable time of arrival there of the Ghomastab, who left Cawnpore on the 18th. " Putting all the circumstances together, it appears to ne that those (of whom I am one) who have friands in Futtehghur may hopefully look forward to the receipt by next mail of an authoritative contradition of the alarming rumours in question." "Youwillseein tenwspaers" Calcutth7 July 4. "1 You vl see in the new3,0apers that go by this maaU an aecount of the massacre at Cawnpore of 120 Europeans who had fed from Futtehghur by boats forAllahabad. Wedonot believe the reports of this affair, because, in the first place, there was nething like that number of Earopeans in the place, even including half-castes under that head; also, because Goverament has had no account of the alleged tranation; and, further, because we learn from the agents here of the Furrucabad ehroffs, of whom we make almost daUy inquiri;e, that up to the 20th or 21st ult. (there is the uncertainty of a day, aurisng from the native method of noting dates) everything at Futtebghur had remained quiet. Now, these native bankers contrive to get their letters conveyed when Government itself fails to do so; therefore we feel inclined to place a good deal of confidence in the accounts communicated by these bazaar men. At the same time there is no denying the possibility of the truth of the reported macsawe of the 8attehghur people. I only hope that in the end it may prove not to be true, and that by next mail we may be able to announce that the commication between that station and Allahabad has been restored, and that we have heard from Mr. - himself as to his own safety." We have received the following letter on this subject from Mr. H. F. Gibbons, of Brick-court, Temple:- " It may perhaps be interesting to some of your readers to know somewhat of Nana Sahib, the wretch who is reported to bave committed the wholesale murders at Bhitoor. He is not, I believe, as represented, the. adopted son of the ex-Peishwa Bajee Rao, nor does he pretend to be so, Dhoondo Punt being the adopted son of that Prince. He is the eldest son of the ex-Peiahwa's Soubahdar, Ram. chunder Punt, and is, as natives go, tolerably wel educated. During his father's lifetime he 'was on ill terms with the Commissioner, Colonel Manson, and was charged by him with forgery, but the offence was not proved. He after wards applied, through his father, the Soubahdsr, for the Post of commandant of cavalry in the Gwahor service, but it was refused him. On his father's death he claimed to succeed to the bulk of the paternal wealth under a will which had been made out in Mahratta and English, but the authorities considered it a forgery, and his younger brothel s claiming equal shares, as under an intestacy, the courts held him entitled to only one-third, instead of the whole. 1is disaffected spirit must have been well known, and his having been left in possession of artillery and such like means of offence is one of those problemss which the Government of lndia ought tobe called upon to explain." THE MUTIWY AT MHOW. FORT, JULY 6. What mary of us have long feared has happened-vin, a mutiny in our regiment, and in that of the cavalry stationed with us. Noarly every regiment of Sepoys in the army had mutinied; and after hearing of the fa1 of Delhi, and from our isolated position, we expected that we might escape, but it was not to be our fate; It began as follows :-- On the morning of the 1st we heard guns in the direqtion of Indore, and about 11 o'clock two guns passed through the centre of our cantonments, and down the Bombay road, An hour after they had passed a- express came in fron Indore, telling us the Residency had been attacked by the Mussulran population of the city, and the native troops had refused to fire on them; that Colo. -nel Durand and all the Europeans that had cscaped the massacre were retreating on the Simirole road, sadathat we were to stop the two guns at all hazards, as they were going to command a pass on the Bombay road, through whichWoodburn's column had to march. Wher the order was given for two companies of ours to turn out and a detachment of cavalry I noticed our men were very long turning out, and on the march would not step out, athough every moment was of consequence. The cavalry were before us and came up with the gun& Captain Brookes ordered a charge, bht they hesitated, and at last went on, he leadting, and killing one man wrho attempted to drawr his sword. The guns ware taken by him, but he could not disarm them until we came up. We took the arms from the guaners, yoked the bullocks to the guns, and came back to cantonmaents. I nQticed how sulky the men were, and when I went to the lines to lodge their amrmunition they told me they had an order to keep 40 rounds in their pouch, butl I wouldnot let them, and there wasa good dealof grumb ling, but they all pretended they were faithful to us, and only wanted their arms in case they were attacked from Indore. However, inrinding away from the lines I saw the men collected ia groups talking, and some with muskets in their hands; this made me more suspicious, and I went and reported it to the Colonel; he, poor man, thanked me, but evidently did not doubt the good faith of the regiment. . However, thank God, my rspresentations, ooupled4 with the ssistance of the officer commanding the Artillery, made him give orders for the occupation of the place we are now in; but, to give our maen confidence in us, we had guards detaohed to our bungalows, and had orders to sleep in our lines. Our dinner was taken down to our serjeant-major's house, close to the lines, and there we sat down. During dinner we saw a light on the roof of our messe house. I went up. and it was put out by the eook. Xo one of the Sepoys of the guards was there. That made me nervous, but I went baok to the lines, and we all sat in A group, talking. After a little while they came and told us there was a ligh in another roof. I went up and beat out the fire wi my cap, and was asssted by a, epoye guard fron my own house. After extinguishing it T wenl back and sat down. Some officer proposed we should then go to our beds at he bells of arms of eiah of our companies, and wewere going, when some one said, "The report Is the regiment will rioe at 10 to-nigght. It then wanted 10 minutes, and our major said, " Oh, very well; ieV,s wAit and see." By Jove, the words were hardly uttered when we heard shots in the ca's alry lines, and we all sprang up, some one crying out we were attacked in rear by the Bheels. We all ran towards our oompanies, bat as I got to mine I was received by two shots, one ia rear and one in front; an officer was behind me, and I sang out, " The maen are firing on us, there is no hope-run." I then saw the adjutant galloping towards our quarter guard ; he was received by a volley. He, poor man, saw it was hopeless, and told Dysart to run. It wa6 a bright, beautiful moonlight night, and we were in our white uniforms, so they could see us for a long distance. I ran and received a volley from our Grenadier compamy, but the bullets went all round me. After a little I was dead beat, and could not move, but, seeing aSyce raUning away with an offdcer's horse, I seized it, and mounted, but, not Lliing to carry away an animal that belonged to another man who might be in danger, I waited under the shade of an empty guardhouse to see for him, but I heard footsteps, and, looking round the corner, I saw the men of our hospit guard within 50 yards of me. I thought then I was done for, but put the horse to a gallop, and beard a shot ping by me quite close. I then made for the fort, and found the gateway all confusion. Our poor colonel -was there on horseback, and, infatuated to the lmt, would not believe the mea had mutinied, and called on the adjauant to follow him to the lines. That was the last we sa&w of the poor fellows. We instantly disarmed the native guard in thefort, andtarned them out, mounted sentries at the baions ouraelves, and prepared for the Worit. It was a feaful night, for some of our officers were on picket duty by them5elres, miles out on the Indore-road, and we feared their death was certain; in fact,the escapes were wonderful. One officer, who had hid in the bazar all night, came into the fort at daybreak, teling us the colonel and aijutant of our regiment had been kIlld ia our lines, and that Msjor Harris was lying dead In the road, shot by his own troopers. The only one we could not account for was Dr. Thornton, of the cavalry. Hearing the bodies wer lying ther, we re solved to bring them in, and wrent out with two gans and some officers moumted to protect them. The scene of pillage and confusdon was horrible; ouz mesahouse was burat to the ground; my own house also. I have lost everything except my sword and pitols, -which I had on at the time of this outbreak. . .. . . . . Having recovered the bodies, and not knowing how many men were near us, we returned to the fort and had the melancholy task of burying them; throughout all this I canot exprepa the admiratlon Ifeel at the way the ladies have behaved -cheerful, and assisting in every way in their power; poor things, veithott servants or quarters, huddled together, tliey have had to do everything for themselveg, and employ all their time i sewing bags for powder for the guns, weU knowing the awful fate that awaits them if the place is taken; there hss not been a sign of fear, they bring us tea or any little thing they can, and would even Like to keep watchon the bastions if we would let them. . Yesterday Holkars Vakeel came over and disclaimed alU participation in the mutiny. We shall see if he is sincere, for they offered to send all the treasure that was not carried off over bere, but I have my doubts. We have no money, and the people round, seeing the state of affairs, won't let us have anything without paying for it. We hear Woodburn's column will be here on the 15h. God speed it ! There is no water in the fort; we are depenadent for it from a well close by, and if we are invested I don't know what we shall do.. It all depends on Holkar, for our mutineers have marched to that rallying place of the faithful, Delhi, to assst there I don't know whether you will ever get this letter, for the road is lined with people to intercept the dlks. You should see the state we are in,-men maldng ulp canister, ladies sewing povwder bags, people bringing plunder recovered, arttiaery mounting guns, and I don't know what all; all of us dirty aad tired with night watching; we mount sentry duty to take the weight of it off the artilerymen; we snatch sleepandfood as we can; we have made a few foraging partes, and I sucoeeded in driving back our mess sheep, to the number of 150, and recovered a lot of mess stores; but all our silver and furniture has been stolen and burnt. This is not a regular fort-merely a sort of store place for spare guns, &c. But we are putting it in as defensible a state as we can, amd I think we shall stagger a few before they capture it. Martial law is proclaimed, and a gallows in course of erection outside the fort gates. Mercy is a word we have scratched out; in fact, mercy to thein is death to us.
THE AdxRicAN MECHA?iT SERviCe,-On Frid&y evealag last considerable excitement was occasioned ia the ishmarket at Hastings, in consequence of a sailor being landed by a Ramsgate fshlng logger, which had picked him up about nine miles at sea, juat atterhe sprang from a packet ship steering up the ChanneL The account he gave of the cause of thus deserting the packet is * most extraordinary one, ad requires the stictest investgation. He said his same was James Freeland, and that he waa a native of Londonderry, Ireland When taken before the Mayor of Hastings at the Town-ball, on the following morning, he made the followig statement :-He said he had lately been at New York, and onthe 23d of July last he was staying at a boasding-house in that city, which vas established for the acomomodation of seaenm. On the evening of that day the master of the boarding-honse, whose name was John White, aiked him to take a glass of grog. He asceptedithe offer and reeived 4 glas of liqoor. Shortly after he bad drank it be fell asleep, and continued in that state until the next morning, when, on awaking, he found himself on board a ship that was steering under ful sal out of the harbour. He afterwards found that it was a packetship, laden with oilcake, and bound from New York to London. When he awoke hereceivedorders to begin work, when he said he had not shipped on board the vessel, and therefore he wished to return to the shore. The reply he received was that themaster of the lodging-house had brought him on board, and had Teceived 17 dollars in advance upon him. He was then ordered to loose the "main royal," which, after some hesitation, he proceeded to do as fast as he could. He did not, however, perform this task quick enough for the mate, who struck bim on the side of the face and told him to do it quicker. He then went on to perform other work with the men, who were all entire strangers to each other, but the captain and mate were constantly beating and ill-using him. There was not a day since he left New York that he had not been beaten and ill-used eiher by the captain or the third mate. On the previous day (Fridayl the ship was in the Channel, about 9 miles off Hastings, aad because he could not do his work quick enoughfor the third mate he came and began to kiok him and abuse him. He got that work done, and began to coil the ropes up, when the third mate iicked him again, and struck hini on the head, saying that he would have satisfaction from him now, for he sprained his finger by bittng him the day before. After continuig his ill-treatment for some time the third mate said, as they were standing at the side of the ship, "Jwump, you son of a -, or I will take your life before you. get to London." Upon this he immediately jumped into the water in order to escape further ill-treat. rment. He was a good swimmer, and as he swaam by the shp's' quarter," some one threw out the lifebuoy, and the captain said, " If you care anything for your life you can pick up the buoy;" but he replied that he would rather be drowned than return to the ship and bne lltreated. The captain then said, "Drown then, you son of a -." and they were the last words that he heard from them. After being in the water about 10 Minutes he was picked up the crew of a. fishing-smack named the Mary and Ann, of Ramsgate, and brought into Hastings. Another of the crew had jumped overboard sinoe they left New York, but was picked up again. He abo saw a man kicked overboar froom the forechains, andafterhe had been in the water about 10 minutes a boat wa put out, but it was then too late, and he was drowned. The man that was picked up wa severely beaten when taken on bod At the request of the Mayor the poor fellow then desoribed the food he had taken mineo he left New York. He said it had been very deficient in quatity. They had been anplied with mous and water, and at dinner they had2Teans boiled up, with a smal piece of bee, that wasaboutenough for three men, Biscuta and b?ed were alo aIlowed them. Of the latter they hd quit enough, and that ws the only article of which they reived a sfficiencr. He hbd wo money in Mis po ion, ad h Dnot receiva any from the captain of the &bp. e only owed the master of the boxrdiug-houe nine dolhls for a fortnight's board, so that if he had received 17 dollars from the captain he took eight-too many. In concluding his sttemeut he added it wa his intention to lay a complaint before the proper authoritles in London,but be thought they would not behevehis toryif he did not bing the matter befoze tis court when he landed. When he was taken into the Mary and Ann he begged and prayed that they would nottke him back to the ahip, and said he would rather be drowned thau go on board the ship, for he had reoeived such ill-treatment. He complained of his back. and sLid he had been knocked about with ha - spike. The crew took himn into the cabin of their boat, when he could scarcely move.

And now this cloud of East Indian zebllion passes athwart the face of tht futare to slTo it still a darker and a more sombre hue. Man iu insterfere with nature, usurped the part of Providence, arrogated tbe functions of Divinity, and he is just "ping the bitter consequences. The spread of dboovery of con - quest, of settlement and trade southward, was anaural mad providential operation. The African slave trade, which gave value and vitality to those disooveries, was also. of natural origin and growth.

(From thes iWew0 York Hcia2) There is one point of view On hichthe Indie n mutiny has not yet been considered by our people. Admitting that the Enrlsh have pursuedan unprinc pled oo orse of r flihusterisor i the acquisteon of teriatory, and a very oppressive and trnnical policy in thiir method of retadong ie, it eannot nevertheless be denied thuat they have conferre somle bene. fits on India by their rule. Of late ears especially honest and wrell -mean efforts have been mLade to introduce 13snroescivilization into thecounttry; workcs of irrigatioa have been undurtaken on a large scale; rallroajis and Ise.F graphs have been established; roads for the conveyance of produce from the intseior to the seaboard have been pro. jected and even commenced; sn sdministration of justiefaulty and corrupt, no doubt, but yet far superior to the native courts-has een solidly planted; *arge and benefial improvements have been made in the flndoo lawrs cen. cerning land tenures, marriages, and wills, tnder ordinary circumstances the effect of these and the other similar im- rovements which are going o d in 50 years make of Indi, far greater country than she has ever been. If however, the present insurrection is to succeed, and t English are to be driven out, these works of civilization. cease, all internal improvements ase stopped, and India relapses first iato anarchy, next into a desolate barbarism. Again, the possession of India and the invincibility of the British army cannot be sacrificed by England without au awful loss of prestige and, ctedit. She could not raise her head again in Europe if she silered the Bindoos t. drive her out, nor could she assume the attitude of an equal in dealing with this country if Ehe were smarting from so hnmiliating an,d irrepable a defeat. Indeed, we have nohesitation in saying that ingenera! terms the power and prosperity of England depend npon the prosperity and maintenance of the Indian empire. if the latter be lost, England will, like Porga, dink to the rate of a fourth-rate Power, and will cease o fill any pla in the world's eye. 'he question for the practicalAmeRican mind is therefore how would this eountry be affected by a relape of India Into barbarism. And how by a declne of England from a firat to a fourth rate Power. The answer to both queries is the same:-Thc UTnited States would in both cases be affected injuriously. Time nee4 not be spent in argument to show that we-shoulE. be losers by the relapee of Hindostan into barbarism Our trade with East India Is not large, though it is large enough for its withdrawal to be felt. But every year, as our capacity to produce and the capacity of the Hindoosto consume increases, it would swell and become more important. Moreover, as a leading nation of the world, we are to a cer. tain extent partners of every other race, andsharersin. their prosperity and their reverses. The relapse of Hi. dostan into bhbarinn would affect us as injuriously as -for instance-a commercial convulsion in England, ai with more permanent results. Btt the declinte and fall of England would be a far nmore seriors matter. seiades being our best estomaer and our closest comnierial all England stands in a position that is peculiarly interesAtn to us, as the head and home of liberty in Europe. England is the only country ia Europe where speoec, thought, the press, and action are free; the onlv home for patriots exiled by despot1sans. Were iglad de. stroyed there would be nO refuge on that side of the water for such men as Victor augo, Xosuth, and Maz2inino dam or breakwter againast the ferocious tyrann of the yFal hon.es andoligarchies. There would not be; foot of so, in all Europe where an honest man oould safely speak his mind on political matterm. Fron the Frazeu Sea to th Miediterranean, Europe-freed from England-would be sealed to the despots; and in their exultation at being released from their terrible antagonts-the great free pram and the bold free mind of England-thereis no saying to what lengts these despotsmight procead.

MONEY-MARKETa7u OITYINT.LLIGNCYB. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 5 per raLle premium1 and the short exchange on Loudon is 25.20 per It. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. per ounce for standard gold it appears that gold is nearly 4-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13.4 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English MiAnt price is therefore at about the same price in London and Hamburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 109i per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is slightly in favour of England. And, after making allowance for charges of tranport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves a small profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The English funds are steadily supported at their late advance. Consols opened this morning at the finn prices of yesterday, and, although a slight reaction subsequently took place, the market again closed with a good appearance. The first transactions for money were at 914 to g, whence, in consequence of a few sales, they receded to 91k. Ultimnately, however, the quotations were 91 for xaoney, and 91# to i for the 9th of September. Bank Stock left off at 214- to 215k; Reduced, 9gi to i; New Three per Cents., 91 to F;' rndia Stock, 212 to 213; India Bonds, 21s. to lSs. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was little demand for money, and it was freely offiered upon Government Securities at 4 per cent. In the discount-market there was more inquiry, but the supply was adequate, and there were few applications at the Bank. The foreign stock-market has been rather active, and prices on the whole are well maintained. In Turkish a fractional advance took place; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed also improved. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1843, were negotiated at 99i; Grenada Deferred, 5B; Mexican, for the account, 22j; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Ce ts., 98; Spanish, 4O7, *ditto, Certificates, 6; kiursh Six per Cents., for the account, 95, 94 , and 95i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99s; and for the account, 994 and i; Duteh Two-ad-a-Half per Cents., 64t and i; ditto, for the account, 640; ditto Four per Cent. C>ertificates, 99 and 99j; and Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 57 and 56. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates of last post were fully maintained. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 5e. for money and 67f. 15c. for the end of the maonth, showing a decline of less than an eighth. The specie by the Magdalena from the West Indies to-day is 275,0001., of which 104,0001. is Australian gold, and the remainder silver. Although the Bank of France have renewed their artificial p-rchases of bullion on a sCale which shows that the reduc'ion in their rate of discount in June last was altogether premature, there seems no reason to apprehend that on this side the supply for the present wi so far fall short as to cause withdrawals from the Bank of England. En addition to the 183,0001. announced yesterday from New York, some amount may also be expected this week by the Ariel. From Australia the total actually overdue is 580,0001., and if the whole of this were to arrive further sums might still be looked for immediately by any vessels making a moderately quick passage. Meanwhile the demand for silver for the East has become less active, in consequence of the quotations received by the last mail, and from the fact of the amount prepared for transmission by the steamer of the 20th having reached 1,250,0001.-the largest shipment ever yet made. When it is considered that our total remittances this year to India and China will thus be raised to about 12,500,0001. against 7,500,0001. in the corresponding period pf 1856, and that in the same interval considerable amounts of silver which would othernise have reached England from the West Coast of Mexico have been constantly diverted thither, there is room to suppose that an effect may have been produced which before the lapse of many months will tend considerably to check the magnitude of these operations. Within the last ten days the whole of the 1,12O,0001. due for theredemptionof the Sound Dues has been paid to Messrs. Hambro and Son, the London agents of the Danish Govermnent. It is understood that this amount is to be retained in Elngland to pay off certain portions of the Danish foreign debt, and the circumstance of its being temporarily employed in the money-market has been one of the causes of the increased ease lately manifested. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Carr, Brothers, the extensive colliery owners, who failed on the 6th inst., was held to-day, when the following statement Was submitted by Mr. Coleman, the accountant:- e GIrERA.AL STATEME-r T OF TrE LLAnrns .s .Z,- Ass=ss or N ESSS.

He trusted that the assets would fetch the values he had set upon them if they are not driven to a forced sale. The collieries are situated in Northumberland and South Wales. In the year 1844 the former were estimated by Air. Foster, a well-known colliery -valuer, to be worth 466.,u001.; while the presehn valuationx is 364,3151., being calculated at the usuali rate ot seven years' purchase. The coal being of superior quality and the demand greater than the supply, there is no doubt they would realize that saum. The Welsh mines were estimated by MIr. C. Carr at 116,5001. ; but in (his) MIr. Coleman's opinion 75,0001. is as much as they can command, the coal produced not being in such request as that from the other collieries. The shares for which 179,9901. -was credited are chiefly shares in the Blyth and Tyne Railwav, which are set down at their market value. The Northumberland District Banking Company, who hold mortgages upon the principal part of the mines, have considerately consented to allow matters to stand over for a year, provided their interest is paid and inspectors are appointed. By a forced sale the amount of the mortgage could easily be realized, but the sutrplus in that cs e for the general creditors would be smalL In aLtswer to questions Mr. Coleman stated that a ssum of 2,501. mutst be Ibd out to bring the Welsh collieries into working order; antd also that3 unless th:e floating trade bills are met7 25,0001 will have to be found to work; the Nortkumberland mines. The course determined upon by the meeting was to wind up the esate under inspection,s aa s to inSre aw full retur to t31Q a ita% and .t e a Messrs. Carr and Co. time to consult with their friends, and perhaps make a suitable arrangement without the transference of their property. Somediscussion ensued upon the wording of the resolu-- tions, an objection being expressed-,ngainst giving the inspectors power to make compromises with the acceptors of bills drawn by the firm but eventually it was agreed to, on the understanding that the parties interested should have a week's notice, to enable thema to assent or refuse. The inspectors appointed were Mr. Bigg, manager of the Northumberland District Banking Company; Mr. Anderson, manager of the Newcastle Branch of the Bank of England ; and Mr. S. G. Smith, of Lombard-street. The amount of debts represented at the meeting was about 540,0001. At the last Consol settlement in the Stock-Excbange some speculators were stated to have compromised their losses by a payment of lOs. in the pound, leaving the brokers whom they had employed to meet the difference. Since that time reports have been current of mercantile failures, but they are believed to have no foundation beyond the circumstance in question. A rumour has been circulated that a merchant at Liverpool lately deceased has left liabilities estimated at 30O,000l., of whichn 100,0001. are upon forged acceptances. The precise facts have not iranspired, but the statement LS believed to be true. The death of the defaulter is stated to have been by suicide, and his losses are supposed to have been incurred by heavy speculations both in cotton and shares.

The advices fcsam India have been variously inter reted, but the general tenoar of private comnaer. cial letters has been discouraging. The'e has, notwithstanding, been a large business in India fabrics, some large purchases havng oeen made on speculation, and, stocks of India goods having been cleared off, manufacturers are holding for higher prices. In yarns shippers to India have been operating to some extent, bat the chief business has been for Germany. The accounts to hand of tho prospects of tzade in Germany are very encouraging, and the sales have been rather large, with an advance of fully U. per lb.

I THEE GREAT WESTERN RAdILWY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. I am much pleased with your remarks in reference to the Great Western Railway, bat you do not allude to what in my opinion, after 10 year experience as a director on a railway with a diseatisfied proprietary, gives the directors sach absolute power over the shareholders. namely, that all proxies mast be registered,aome days before the meeting at which they are:used. Thisenable the boardto ascertain exaotly how they stand,and to bring their influenoe to bear on any proprietor they can who has registered his proxy against them-and if the worst comes to the worst they make terms with their opponents. Bach undue influence does it give them that I never yet heard of the direotors of any line being in a minority in a meeting unless more or less divided among themselves. I believe there is no such clause as this in any of the old canal Acts, but it has been slyly introdnced into those of all railway companies. I am resnactfnllv. CCBALE5 STUXGE Birninghwn, 8 mo, 17.

RAILWAY AND MINING SRARES. I __ _ Taesdav Evening. The railway-market to-day has been firm; in some eases at an advance. Great Northern, Great Western, Lancaster and Carlisle, Brighton, and Birmingham andfDerby improved; Eastern Counties, on the other hand, were flatter. Caledonian, which after official hours last night were quoted at the reduced price of 76 to 77, closed to-day at 77j to 78, and after 3 o'clock a further small rise took place. Areduction occurred in East Indian and GreatIndian Peninsula. In foreign shares Great Luxumbourg were rather higher, and Paris and Lyons receded 0#s. The transactions in British North American IBank show a decline of 11. In miscellaneous secu- rities a fall of 11. took place in Peninsular and I Oriental Steam; Netherlands Land shares were also 1 slightly lower.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. LONDON AND BLACKWALL. 'me na1U-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern, M1r. J. tL Daniell in the hir. .._. Thberport, an abstrtmtof which has appeared in lVze 1inie, was submitted. The C E,sr, in moving the adoption of the report, expreed regrt that the board was not in a position to declare * better dividend. (Hear, hear.) The amoant of the passenger traffic on the main line had failen off, but in all other ramifications of it there had been an improvement. They had for the past Alf-yea, in consequence of oertain works having been completed, been obliged to carry to revenue interest whieh had hitherto been borne by capitaL The outlay bad been made for improving the stations and enlarging the avenues at the B=wall teriniuns in order to enable them to accomodate uch traffic as they had every remon to believe would oome upon the line. The falling offof paemger traffic on the Blackwall Railway was to be a d ttothe diminution of tra'ellinj to the docks fromBlacwall andPoplar. Thequestion was, nowthey could incrasmetheirpamengerrecpts. Anattemptto diminatheir fares would involve a serious responsibility upon theboard. The directors bad on various ocossions reduced as wel as raised their fares and, they belizeved. from experience and consideration of the question that the fares now charged weoe beat calculated to yield the largest amount of niet profit to the comny. The Easter Counties had increeaed the number of their trains in oonnexion with the Blackwall line, and that company. was workinig the Blackwall ttAffi in a very fair and friendly manner. They 'r aso in expectation of receiving an additional amount of goods traffic from the Eastera Counties, and the Blackr wall Company's superintendent had been referred to to ascerain the amount of good. traffic thay could receive from the Eastern Counties without any interference with the Blackw&Al passnger accommodation. They mi~ght also fairlycalculate upon an additional receipt from the Bow and Barking line, where there would be a considrable ICloa traffic; and further, it waa reasonable to expect that the developement of the buslness of the Victoria Dooks would throw an additional amount of traffic n their line. The motion for the adoption of the report hang been seconded, Thg CHAifH, in reply to a quntion, 8aid'the debenture capital amounted to 337,3501., which had been raised at 3A 4, 4Q 4i, and somae portion at 5 per cent. Upon what bid fallen in lately they had been obiged to raise the amount at 4i, and 3 portion it 5 per oent. Mr. G. SMrni oppoeed the adoption of the report. He thought there must be something wrong in the management, and he begged to move that the report of thedirectors bereceivedandadopted as regarded a payment of dividend only, aud that the remainder of the report be referred to a committee of seven proprietors of the comapny to in. quire into and examine all bookh, agreements, and documents; to call for the attendance of any ofricer havingpos. seson of the same, and employ officidal accountant, if necesary. The C xsimiA explained that the company had, with a very short line, to provide for the interest on enormous capital; that the groms traffic upon the line had actually increase, but, as before stated, the revenue for the past half year had necesarily been called upon to pay intrest which had heretofore been charged against capital. The accounts were presented In a form which all could understand; and he was satisfied that a fair consideration of the positionof thecompeny andthe conduct of the board would lead them to the conclusion that every thng that could possibly be done for the welfare of the undertildng had been performed, and that the appointment of such a committee of inquiry as had been uiovede for by the hon. proprietor oould not result In any benefit to the body of the shareholders. (Cheerm) After a considerable discussion the amendment was put, and lost by a large majority. The originl inotion as then put and carried, and a vote of thaiks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings. LONDONDERRY AND ESNISEILE. The balf-yearly meeting of this company was held yeterday at the office, Coleman-street-buildings, Moorgate-treet; Mr, J. Clay, LP., in the chair. lr. - thur, the secretary, read the report, au abstract of which appeared in The Times of Monday. The CH A., in moving the adoptien of the report, said that in almost every item of traffic their receipts were increasing; if not very largely, they were at least very steadily increaing. With regard to the pssenger traffic there was an increae in the number of first aud second class pasengers, but there wras falling of in the number of thirdclass pa8sengers. This had ansen from not having had so many excursion trains in the last halfyear as they had at the corresponding period of 1856 lthere was an increase i the toods traffic of 4,000 tons, which iacrease was very fairly distributed over all wrts of ,cods There pas a slght decrease ia the cattle traffic of or 40L, but not of any conseoeence. The directors had placed to the aco0unt of revenue every itenA th4t within the widest limits could be charged to that account, and they had endsavoured to avoid pluaing to capil anything that could be avoided. The altertions of a new en&e that had never been used were charged to revenue, wich mcight have been firly charged to capital. On oomparlngthe items of expenditure on permanent way, stations, and aolling stock it would be seen they had expended 8001. mnore in the st half-year than in the same period of 1856. The patW. forms at seeal stations had been doubled in length, and the expense had been charged to reveune. That, of course, made so much deduction from, the profit or net inorease from working the traffic. 4.t.the same, time the working expenses generally aud bee reduced, so that the total expenditure, including ihose additioal charges, amounted only to 2701. more than itr the eoTe. spoling period of 1856, wrhile the traffic receipts had iacreased by 1,6324, leaving the net inrase 1,3611. They were grsadualy and steadily overcoming their di;ficulties. They had considerable difficulties in placing their debentures in lieu ef those required to be paid off He could not account for the difficulty they met th in raisng mon on their debentures at 5 per cent., because they were amp secured. They were taking 10,0004 ayear over ayd above their debenture interest, which did not exceed 7,5001. a-year at 5 per cent. on the 100001. they were authorized to borrow: He would be happy to answer any questions, and moved the adoption of the report. Mr. LA-vip, a director, seconded the motion. 3r. HEafNG contended at considerable length that more acoommodation should be afforded to their pasenger-traffic, with a view to increase it. He recommended the addition of a short train daily, because he felt convinced that the effect would be to incease the traffic in proportion. He found that their goods traffic had increased to a much greater extent than the passenger traffic. He sdvered to the great water Dower they had near the line from Strabane to Omagh. The railway crossed the river five times between those places, and the fall was 200 feet. Mr. Fairbarn, of Manchester, had seen it, and had stated that theze was no other water power in the three kingdoms so valuable as that on their line between Strabane and Omagh. The company would require an additional traffiec of 4504. a-week to enable them to ;y6 per cent. per nnum on the capital Invested in the unacrtahng. lir. Riussr -ought thnt the directors would feel much obliged to Mr. Hemming for any suggestions he could make to the board for improving the trafmic, and that they would not refuso to carry anything out which they thought would be beneficial He beLeved the passenger trffio generally on the Irish lines had fallen off, and therefore they must expect to suffer in some respects, although he did not know from what cause it had falen off. Mr. FusLLs, one of the auditors, explained that Mr. LAver, one of their directors, had devoted a gret deal of time to improve the podtion of the company, and had settled matters in dispute with merchants and others at Derry and other places on the line to the satisfaction of all parties. The C }nBsr stated that the suggestions of Mr. Hemming had been attended to, and every inquiry had been made on the spot by Mr. Cross and himself as to the necessity of putting on an additional train, but there was only one gentlemana in the district who thought it would be an advantage. They would, of course, be glad. to adopt any suggestion that would have the effect of increasing their net receipts. Mr. BAuLow, C,B., a director, said that an increase of the umuberof trains should be done very carefully. He believed they had at present a suficient number of trains for the traffic, which yielded only 2S. 6d. per mnile, and it would not do to run a train at a loss. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, delaring the dividend in full on the 6 per cent. preference shares, and at the rate of 3s. 3d. per share, or 24 12s. per cent. per annum, on the 12. ls shar Captain Warren and Mr. H. LAver, the retiring directors. were re-elected; and also Mr. Whethatm, the retiring auditor. On the motion of Mr. Hl-u econded by Mr. CoRnn, the remuneration to the auditors was increased from 51. Es. to 104. 10s. each per annum. Captain W,&V, in returning thanks for his re-election, and that of his friend Mr. Lover, said that the great objet with him and the other directors was to do everything in their power to further the general interests. He believed that Mr. Laver was one of the largest shareholders in the company, and, in fact, he and all the directors were large shareholders: The directors, therefore, would do all they could to improve the property d make it remunerative as early as possible. A vtot of ks to the chaiman nd directors concluded the proceedings. ITORTH BRITISH. A special meeting of this company was held in Edinburgh on Monday, to consider and decide upon the means whereby the mnterests of the omupanymay be protected and promotel in relation to the construction of a rilway or railways to the south of their terminus at Hawick. The chair was taken by Mr. Hodgson, chairman of the board. The CnAIEMAY, in introducing the scheme of the directors to the shareholders, wich he did at onsiderable length, said that he had never felt a deeoer sense of reapon. sillUyin sddressing the shareholdes, ease he believed that this was a crsi of g eater moment than had ever occured in the history of the North British Railway, and because he felt that on their decision denended the quetion whether thbis company was to maintaintie pcsitioniowhich it was entitled among the railway comnies f Great Britain. The question which the shareholders ha to decide was, whether their traffic which was eeeing to heist out at Fawick Ws to be pent up theroer'esubject to the ontrol of advrse influences, or whether ould g along with the direetors in opening out that route to free andun iAtrrpd traffic, and thus allow the KorthBritish E.llway toexpad'ibslf e it oughLt to do along 'ith the trade ad commerce of the country, and to develop those zo urees winch it preent Lay dormant in tie important disHriot to which hereferred.

SECOND EDITION, TH1B TIME&OFFICE, Wedmsday Moru.g. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre-, spondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 4 p.m. - l A private letter from Rome, emanaing from the same correspondent who, on former occaions, gave sote interestingedetails relative to Irish ecclesi- I astical affairs, states] that LCardinal B&rnabo and , D)r. Cullen, the Roman Catholie Archbishop of I Dublin, persevere In their determination to remodel or reform the Catholic Church in Ireland, and that the presumed adhesion of the new Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel to these views is an incentive to vigorous measure. This reformation, as my correspondent has already stated, is to embrace the prelacy, priesthood, and all the eeclesiastical and lay establishments in which Irish Catholics are educated. The meas by wbich it is to be effected is the confiding the discussion and decision of all national religious or religio-politieal questions practically to the four Archbishops and the Propaganda of Rome. A rumour has circulated for some days past in Paris that the system has been actually commenced, at least so far as the Irish College in this city is con merned. It is affirmed, however, on good autho rity, that by far the greater number of the Irish Bishops are opposed to the change, but that what is termed " the Barnabo-Culleu following" argue that " the ficklenes and instability of the Celtic character, and the notorious want of business habits of the Irish Bishops ilt general, will in a short time flly reward the patience, perseverance, and calmn eaergy of the Propaganda, and of the L-ish Delegate." It also states that the manner in which Archbishop MacHale was received by his oreligionists and Roman Catholic clergy of London, and the close and friendly relations manifestly existing between that Prelate and Cardinal Wiseman, have not afforded much pleasure to the " Cullen following." My correspondent postpones to some other occasion his explanation of the motives of this union between the two dignitaries, of the reasons against the probability of its duation, the evidence of Dr. Cullen's paramount influence at Rome, and his superiority of rights, judgment, and precedence, as alBo the great injusticeof connectIng in any way the name of this Prelate Vith the Sadleirite party. HIe writes: *Romsa Catholic Bishop aroe required by the canons of the Church to pay visits at stated periods ad I'irina 0postolorum, and to render an account to tlhe Pope of the state of their respective dioceses. This law had nearly fallen in disuse in Ireland, at least so far as personal visitQS Were concerned, for the Irish Bishops generally contented themselves with performing the duty by proxy. The Pro. paganda hbs very properly determined to tolerate this negligence no longer, and to put an end to the abuse to which much of the semi-GalUcanism of Ireland, and its con. comitant evils, are attribatable, and for which the present factUties of travelling aflord no excuse. The recent visit of the Bishop of Down and Connor is a proof of the wisdom of this measure. The dioceses hid been represente.1 as greatly neglected, and as much needing the vigour and energy of a youthful coadjutor. The Bishop, it appeared, adduced conclive proof tIht these representations were completely unfounded, and that the unite dioceses continued to receive signal benefits from his lAbous The Bishop has lbeen for some time past the only Roman Catholio prelate On the Board of Directors of the national schools of Ireland. Before he set oat on his return to his diocess it appears he had consented, in compliance with the expressed desire of very high Catholic rauthority, to find an early opportity of resigning his posi'ion. At Rome it is thought vl3y inconvenient that ecclesastics should take part in the active directionlof, and identify thqmselves with, a system of education which predudes the emblem of Christianity from the school] room; and which practically teaches that re. Bgion has nothing to do with the ordinr arffirs of life, and that, like merely human things, it has only its special hours, moments, and exercses. The Catholic lay Commissioners, however, will not be required to disconnect them selves from the Board. " You may remember that one of the Professors of yay. nooth had be3n required to retract or explain certain opinions attributed to him in a report of the evidence before the lat Commission of Inquiry on that College. The report was forwarded to Rome by the Apostolic Delegate, and the Fathers Of the Synod, held last June in Dublin, were relactant to record on their minutes the letter of Cardinal Barnabo on that matter, and thesabmission of the Pro. fessor. When, ulticaately, they consented to do so, they added that the whole affair had proceeded from inacarate Information forwarded to Rome. This rider displeased both Cardinal Barnabo and Dr. Cullen, and is supposed to have something to do with the recent visit of the Profeesor to the :Eternal City. It is believed that the matter is atlength satis. factorily and finally settled. But this was not the only oues. ti on wbioh the most rev. Fathers of the Synod disappointed the e ctatiorns of the Propaganda and its representative in Iretanc- The connexion of Miaynooth with a Protestant Or mixed, and not over friendly administration, and its own statutes, were and wiil be an obstacle to a radical remodellng of this establishment, but it is thought they are not * suffi. cient reason for doing so little as has been done to infuse a proper spirit into the College, which onght to be a great ad. vantage to Ireland and to the missions served by the Irish. The clearest test of the feelinge of the Bishops of Ireland Was their si-gular legislation for their seminary in Paris, and their attempt to introduce and establish there some of the greatest abuses of Maynooth. Those venerable men seemed to labour nuder the erroneous impression that the :English constitution, with its restrictions on the free and prompt extension of suthority, was a model for ecelestas. tical polity. To enforce its commands temporal autholity has the sword, which should be slowly unsheathed; but ecclsastical rule in our country is supported by moral and spiritual weapons only. The French Government possesses supreme control over the Irish College in Paris, and, it is said, has declared against the Irish Bishops. These prolates are, therefore, getting themselves into difficulties with the supreme temporal and spiritual authorities in this matter. See how well St. Agatha's College works. Let the College des Irlandais be confided to the care of the Pro. paganda and to the Apostolic Delegate in Ireland, and the result vill be similar. " The Catholic University in Dublin has ever occupied an important place in the thoughta of the Holy Father and of the Propaganda. It was feared some time ago that the relations of the heads of that establishment with Dr. Cullen were not so cordial as might be desired. It was even suspected that a titular Professor, high in the contidence of Dr. Cullen, had his sanction for advancing certatn pretensions and dictation at which Dr. Newman might have taken reasonable offence. Owing to these and somelother reasons the venerable Rector was about to return to his convent. The Holy Father, however, inter. fered. Dr. Newman has for the present ,elimauishedhis purpose, and he will remaIn at the head of the tUniversity which he has conducted with much credit to himself and satsfaction to his superiors. It appears that the Rector is dispensed from permanent residence, and as soon as a suitable Vice-President is found he will be at liberty to devote a considerable portion of his time to his convents. It ii mech to be deplored that cU the Irish prelates and priests do not appear to afford to this eminent man the moral support and sympathy to which he is so well entitled. If they do not suoceed, aided by the support of such a man in establishing a national system of superior Catholic education, what hopes can thev have of ever attaining so desirable a consummation ? There is no want of learning or zeal on the part of the professors, nor is there an example of want of money, orof whxt can belprocared by money; and no one amquainted with the Irish will deny that there is a want of sound Catholic learning in the middle and upper ranks." Permit me to add a few words respecting the Irish College in thie city. If I am correctly informed, it has not been, and cannot become, a purely eoclesiastical establishment. The Irish families whose ancestors were benefactors to the Paris College can at all times claim the benefit of their foundations 7;. -- Itn may not be uninteresting to know the actual annual income of this house. The administrator is obliged to make a return, at the beginning of every new year, of the expenditure of the preceding one, and of the anticipated revenue and expenditure of the current one. The following is, I believe, a correct statemedt of the estimated income of the college for. this year Rent of the house called Les Lombards ... c,200 Do. of the houe, Rue dee Postes 1,200 Do. of the house at Bordeaux .. 4,500 Interest .1,875. Dividends ...... ... 65 Rent from college at Nantes 4 , 00n Excedant du oompte ; 3,958 Int6r6t du fonds au tr6sor 400 Remboursement ... .... 400 Pension of students... ... 3,54i. Eventual receipta ... 300 8,258 90,977 The above does not, I believe, comprise the pro- ceeds of the fund left by the Abbe Walsb, which is said to %e regulated by the Archbishop of Paris. Nor des it include the building itself, which is rent free nor the country house and ground (about four or five acres), at Acueil, near Paris, whioh as'purehased by the late Superior, Dr. MacSweeny, and which may be valued at about 20,000f. a year. It is inhabited by such of the studenta as remain during the summer vacation. The income from the funds, as above stated (in 1857 put do%a at 65,944f.), was, at the conversion of the Five per Cents. into Four-and-a-Half, estimated at 73,290f. The income from the house3 (Nantes, Bordeaux, Lombardy, aad rue des Postes -in fact house property) was *bout 10,000f., making the gross income then about 83,290f. It is hardly necessary to say that house property has increased everywhere for the lat feWr years The above details I think fii the main correct. There may be aa error, but it can be only, trifling. It is clear, then, that the College de Irlandais does not rank among the poorest of ecclesiastical seminaries. A lithographic sheet, published in Madrid, in the pay of the Narvaez Cabinet, as it has been in that of every Governnent for many yean past which thought its services worth the purchase, contais a letter, professing to come from the Havannah, and .teeming with abuse of The Times fcr the statementa 't has contained with respect to the importation of slaves into Cuba. "Our Captain-General," it says, "has taken, in these last months, efflcaciouw measures to repress the traffic in negroes." It appears, then, to be admitted, even by the zealous and intemperate defender of General Concha, that, until these last months, the measures taken were not efficacious. It is not surprising that, on finding the importation of slaves exposed and criticized by the European press, and made the subject of inquiry in the British Parliament, the Cuban Captain-General thought it advlsable to make some show of activity inl the right direction. Probably, too, he was admonished to do IBso by his own Government, as a consequenoe of the energetic representations made by Lord HIowden at Madrid. Accordingly, we find in the Havannah Gazette a circular addressed by Concha to the Governors of provinces, who are thereby ordered, " so soon as they become aware, by the indications which generaUy precede, that the disembarcation of an expedition of slaves is preparing, to send out of the district of their jurisdiction the persons whom they believe to be in connivance with it, giving them passports for the point they may select, so long as it be not one that offers any inconvenience or any danger that they may continue dedicating themselves to the traffic In slaves." The circular furthe-r zays, that if the landing is effected, the persons who appear to have taken part in it or to have hidden the slaves on their estates are to be sent to the Havannah, whence, if proved guilty, they may be expelled the island ; and the Governors are authorized to employ force and to go to such expense as they may deem indispensable for the suppression of the slave trade. All this looks very well upon paper, but unfortunately in Spain and in the mouths of Spanish Captains-Ceneral such proclamations are too often mere wind, intended to carry dust into the eyes of the foreigner. And the same mail which brings us news of General Concha's vigilance and of the indignation of his partisans at the charges made against him, brings letters which represent the slave trade to be as briak as ever, "' To-day," says one of these, " they disembark in one place, tq-morrow in another. Orders of repression are sent to and fro, but, nevertheleas, those that reach tha island are landed ancd left quiet, in consideration of an insurance of five ounces per head. So that with this and with the anonymous societies the Marquis will make an Imnmense fortune." The " societies" are explained by other letters, which say that a fever now reigns for the formation of companies, industrial and of credit, and that this fever is profited by on a large scale by the authorities of the island, who concede authorizations in consideration of a certain number of shres, on -which they pocket the premium. The extent to which this is carried, say the letters, is scandalous. It is possible that the Caban authorities may have enemies disposed to exggerate to their disadvantage, but it is positive that the official Havannah Gazetle teems with authoriztions for these companies, many or most of which will prove mere babbles. As regards the importation of daves, and the shameful extent to which it has been carried under Concha's Govermment, these are facts which have been proved over and over again, by official reports to the British Government and in various other ways; and it was also proved beyond a doubt, by Concha himself, during his former Viceroyalty, that, when the Captain-General chooses, the traffic may be effectually checked, and, indeed, almost entirely suppressed. At Madrid, the practice of Cuban Captain-Generals of making large fortunes by conniving at the introduction of negroes, is well known, commonly talked of, denied by none but those who have an interest in concealing the truth, and disapproved by very few. In Spain, the first duty of an official man is held to be to make money-by fair means if he can, but by all means if those be inadequate. By a despatch from Jassy we learn that it had become known there that the French Government had demanded the annulling of the Moldavian elections. The news had produced a great sensation, and quite a panic among the anti- Unionists. The Austrian Consul immediately left Jassy to confer with Baron Prokesch at Constantinople. From explanations which have taken place at the French Foreign-office, it would seem that M. de Prokesch has somewhat exceeded his instructions, and has been accordingly blamed by his Government. It is understood to have been the intention of the Emperor of the French to confer the Grand Cross of the Legion of Eonour on M. de Thouvenel on the occaion of the f9te of the 15th inst., but that out of a feeling of delicacy towards the British and Austrian Government, His Imperial Majesty postponed for the present the bestowal of this mark of distinction. A telegraphic despatch announces that the fleet under command of Admiral Trehouart sailed this morning from Toulon for Ajaccio. The removal of General Montauban from his command at Oran has been decided upon by the Minister of War, but will not take place until after the termination of the trial of Captain Doineau and the other persons accused of the murder of the Aga Ben. Abdallah. Colonel Rochebouet, of the artillery of the Imperial Guard, has been commisioned by the Emperor to construct a polygon for artillery practice at the camp of Chalons-sur-Marne. Troops are marching from various points to the camp. M4. Goldrey Boileau is appointed French Consul at Calcutta in place of M. Valbezen, who goes to Antwerp. The last-named gentlemen, who was formerly Consul at the Cape of Good Hope, is well known in France, under the nom-de-plume of Major Fridolin, as the author of some clever novels. He has recently published, in the Re'u des De=s Moondes, a series of papers on British India, to which late events in that country have given particular interest. The Prifept.of Police has addressd abcircular to the Commis"T"j of Police of. the deaartment of the Seine re,iR to the reduction made in the prioeej breil lor the last fortnight of the present month. AfWr alluding to the kindness of their Majesties in sablishipg cheap food kitheW4dxinR the winter and other acta of private charity, he says "Thanks to all these efforts, we were able to aihsij4 the effect. of the food crisis. It now approaches its termination, but its results will weigh on ua for some time longer. It is only at the cost of grt acrifice that duinig the last thre years we have been able to maintain bread in Paris and in the davrtiment of the Seine at a lower price than in the other -parts of the empire. The Municipal Couneil of Paris, which has assisted in this work, his been oompelled to call for the repVament of the considerable advances it has madie both in the interest of the finances of the city, and in that of the great public workl in which the present and futare welfare of the working classes is involved. Its decision, which has been approved of by the Minister of Commerce, has led to the necessity of maintaining the price of bre&d s little above the real prioe. That measure wiU be applied with extreme reserve, and the additional price will neverexceed two or three centimes as the maximum per kUogramme of brea{. This slight ovtrcharge of a centimne per half lloginmme shows th"t the Emperor does not wish the people to pay, by frewhaufferings, for the alleviationWalreadyafforded them. Make this known to them, with the Assetanoe that no oSe is more anxior s than myself to carry out the views of the Emperor." The Moniteur publishes a report made to the Emperor by the Minister of the Interior on the generalsituation of the Orphelinat of the Prince ImperiaL After alluding to the generous idea of. the Empress which inspired the foundation of the institution, the Minister goes on to say;- " The institution came into operatio, Qxn the Ist of January, 1857, at which date there were 47 orpham provided for; that number bas since increased-to-150. Only one death has taken plac snce the oommencement. The report states that as the 600,000 subscribers from whom the institution derived its first resources principally belonged to the department of the Seine, the permanent commission had thought it right to assist by preference the orphan children belonging to that department. In consequence 118 out of the 150 childreu have been born in the department of the Seine. ALl of them have been placed with families residing either in Paris or in the srrondissements of St. Denis and ceuxr. The allowances made in the name of the Prince Imperial necessarily vary according to the want i to be relieved, but the average has been 200f. a year. That sum, although small, has afforded comfort to the poor children who have been the objects of it. They have obtalned more abandant and wholesome food, and clotbing better suited to their wants than they could otherwise have had It is, however, on the education and future well-doing of the orphans that the institution will exercise the most salutary iuuence. They will be inspired with sentiments of religion and industry, and, by being constantlyunder the surveiUlane of the permanent commission, both intheiradoptive families, at the schools, and in the workshops, their intellectual development wiU be assured. Out of the orphans who have been admitted to the benefits of the institution, 46 have already been placed apprentices to different trades: for 14 of them the tersn of their ap. prenticeship has not been yet fixed; three will have completed their time next year; four others in two years, 11 in 1860, ten in 1861, and four in 1862. As the allowances made by the institution for the support of the orphans oease when they are put ouat apprentioes, there will be frora 1857 to 1862 32 admissions vacant; but a much greater number of applications will doubtless be made, which from want of funds canmot be attended to. The dotation of 30,000f., annually granted by the Emperor, now forms the principal revenue of the institution, although of late private donations have been made to it. The people of Paris know to whom they owe the benefit arising from the Orphelinat, and their affection unites in the same sentiment of gratitude your Majesty, the Empress, and the Prince Imperial." The Emperor's fgte was celebrated at Marseilles on Saturday last during a heavy fall of rain. A solemn servimce was performed at 10 o'clock in the ,provisional Cathedral of St. Martin, which was followed by a Te Deum, at which the civil and military authorities assisted. The fireworkl, which were to have been let off in the afternoon, and the illuminations in the town were postponed in consoquence of the rain to Sunday evening. The Moniteur publishes a long list of diplomatic appointmonts.

A day or two since you were told that some priests had been excommunicated in Lombardy for refusing to recognise as a dogma of the Church the Immculate Conception, and some further information will now be given on the subject. The names of the priests who were excommunicated at Payia, "by order of tfle Papal See," are 'Aquaroni, Grignani, Parona, and Tesca, men well renowned for their erudition, morality, aud charity. The proceedings against them greatly displeased the inhabitants of the city, and the placards announcing that they were under the ban of the Ohurch were torn down alnmost as soon as they were posted. As the police interfered to prevent the removal of the placards, some very unpleasant rencounters took place, but the end of the matter was that the offensive advertisement had en- tirely disappeared on the third day. Me Tenca is seriously ill, but no one ventres to visit him, because it is the will of the Holy Roman Catholic Church that he should be completely isolated, and Austria is astonished that the Italians should make such desparate efforts to shake off the yoke of Rome and her protectors. The foregoing statement will probably be contradicted by one or other of the " ultramontane" organs with which the continen' now tees, but you may be assured that it is perfectly correct, The clergy in Yienna have succeeded in suppressing a suburban dance even more ecoentrio than the French cancan, but they have not raied their voices against the demoralizing lottery. On my return to my post after.a short absence it was related to me that the Minister of Finances h&I tendered his resignation, but it,aw not until this morning that any further. information could ba acquired on the subject . It seems that Baron Brek desired that the expeusve cavalry regiments might be reduc ,and expressed a *ish to be permitted to quit. office, when he foaud that no attention was paid to his advice. The Minister of the Interior is said to have Arranged t* differen=6 between his co.lleague and the Court, but the report can hardly be correct. Bum ieh and Bacon Bmuck have a pet dislike to each -other, and wy interventhi=n.ohe i_art .f the 9, rouldsuredlv have been taken in ill-part by the latter. It in rimoured in the city that Baron Bach is to be Minister of State (Staats-Minister), but nothing is known on the subject in official circles. Some person bAa attempted to bribe one of the judges in the Criminal Court, for we read in the columns of the official Gazetts that if the 6,000Lf. (6001.) which were sent to Ar. +**** (Rister) are not at once claimed, the money will be given to some charitable institution. It is supposed that the person who speculated on the corruptibility of the judge is connected with come contracters who durmg the war defauded Government to a large amount, and are now under ensmiPation. Baton Brentano, counsellor in the Ministry of nances, is gone to London. According to some persons he will endeavour to persuade Messrs. Baring to share in the Suez Canal speculation, but otlhers "feel sure" that he will endea;-our to obtain a loan for his Government. The Emperor probably returned last night from Hungaxy to the Castle of Laxenburg, but it is not yet positively known here that suLch was the case. We learn from Konigsberg that each of the regiments of the Rumsian Guard will be reduced to 800 men. A Russian flotilla is being got ready for an expedition to Cbina. A telegraphic despatch from Vienla, dated Tuesday, 18th inst., says:- " The Oesterreichiscke Coyespondn, the official organ of the Austrian Government, confirms the re-establishment of the entsnz¶e between the Powers on the Moldavian question. It says that Austria and England have advised the Porte to order new elections, and that it is hoped the Porte will consent to do so. ITALY. i (FMO- OUR OWN COESrBONxDNT.) isxo~r oun TURIN, AUG. 16. Yesterday was the Feast of St. Napoleon-whose right to a place in the Calendar is, I believe, by the I by, somewhat doubted by several orthodox Church- men-and it was, in consequence, observed with i great rigour by the French Legation here. In the morning there was high mass performed in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, at which all the members of the French Legation assisted; and in the evening the Duke de Grammont gave a fulldress dinner, to which all the Ministers of the King of Sardinia were invited, as well as all the members of the Corps 3)iplomatique, with the exception of lthe Charg6 d'Affaire" of Turkey and Naples As the 15th of August is also the Feast of the Annunciation, it is, of course, kept a strict holyday by all good Catholics who do not particularly want to work on that day, so that at all events St. Napoleon's day is pretty sure of meeting with great cbservance, whether he be strictly entitled to claim it or not. The papers here have expressed great indigenation at the three persons who have lately disgraced the name of Italy, and been sentenced for their crime I by the Criminal Court of Paris. What has roused I the feelings of the people in this part of Italy, more tha- anything else, was a report that one of those culprits (Tibaldi) was a native of Biela, in Piedmont. Three cities of Italy, it seems (Biella, Longo, and Faenza), contend for the honour of not having given birth to that illustrious character. | They all disclaim the maternity with equal fervour, so that it would require another Solomon to de, ide which he really does belong to, but I believe it has been clearly ascertained, for the honour of Biella and Piedmont, that he is neither a Biellese nor Piedmontese. MazzinA's paper, the ItaZia del Popolo, of Genoa, was again sequestrated yesterday. These sequestrations have become so frequent latterly that hardly a day passes nowv without our hearing of one or other of the journals of the extreme parties at Genoa being sequestrated. One day it is a red paper, the next day a black, the day after a red again, and so on. The ratepayers of Genoa, having re-elected nearly intact the same Municipal Council as the Government dissolved some time ago on account of its illegal proceedings regarding the Excise duties, it has become necessary for the Government to choose a Syndic or Mayor from among the number, and it has done so by offering the appointment to the Marquis Ignazio Pallaavicini, who obtained the greatest number of votes in the late municipal election. The object of the Government in making this offer was, no doubt, to show that it did not wish to exercise its prerogative in any way that might be thought injurious or slighting to the interests or feelings of the Genoese. The Marquis Pallavicini is of one of the oldest families of the Republic, and is himself one of the richest noblemen of Genoa: he is a senator of the kingdom, and on all questions when the city of Genoa haa been interested he has invariably voted as a Genoese citizen rather than as a Sardiuian subject. His nomination ought therefore to have been gratifying to his fellow-townsmen, but it is reported he has refused on the ground of ill-health, and so it is supposed the Government will namae as Syndic the next highest on the poll, Advocate Morro, and who had been already spoken of for that office. I have just received the following letter from Florence, dated August 12 :- " Considered as the source of a serious misunderstanding between the Minister of the Interior and the Governor of the town, the late events at Leghorn aflord suficient itert to warrant my sending you a few lines on the subject. To begin at the beginning, then, I must tell you that about the middle of April last some agents of foreign Governments warned the Minister that they had strong reasons for believing that insurrectionary movements were meditated in Italy, and that Leghorn was specially chosen as the plae where they shonld first break out. The Minister, SanducciL thereuponhastened to inform the Governor of Leghorn, Caviere Bargagli, ia order that he might take mesures to counteractthese azzinian plots. On th receipt of ths intelligence, Cavaliere Bgagli replied that there was nothng to fear, and that all precaution was unnecessary. Soon after, however, some arms were landed on the coast of Tuscany, which were seized by the police, and which led to the arrest of some young men of Pisa, and amon them of tbree students of the University of that city. Towards the end of the month of May, Cavaliere Bargagli reported to Government that the ' Republican Committee' of Leghorn had anited with the ' Constitutional Com. mittee,' and that they were agreed to act together for the purpose of overthrowing the absolute Government, and handing over the town to the Piedmontese, but at the samne time that there was nothing to dread from this ooalltion. On receiving this report, Signor Lauducoi wished to act with energy and to employ preventive measures, but ne was met by a strong oPposition from the otherMinisters, and even from the Grand Duke himsef, who hd full confidence in Cavaliere Bargagli. The result was a serious difference between the Prince And the Minister, so serious that the latter s said to have meditated proffering his resignation, though this resolution he subsequently abandoned, Bat the investigations made by the police in the meanwhile proved that the Jhseinbarcation of ams was altogether a Mazzinian work, performed at the moment when the pretended coalition with the C0nstiutionALsts, and, above all, the idea of an understanding between the conspirators and Piedmont, was frightening the superior authorities. It has been since assertd that the Constitutional Committee had nothing whatever to say to the Republicans, but held aloof withthe pro mise of neither favouring nor opposing their movements " Whea the 30th of June arrived the Gorerninent had eot taken any precaution La prevent the revolutionay I ttempt in preparation. On the contrary, he contlnued up to that very moining to "ssre the Governmeit-or the tranqullity of Leghorn. The Grand Duke was then, with bis sons, at Bologna, on a visit to the Pope; the hereditary Printces was alone At Leghorn, whither she .had gone fcr iC -bothing. At 4 oolook in the afternoon a 'Becret friend, whoa was :nixed. up with the -Republicans, went with fsignor.

THE IXDIzV ARMY. to * TO TE1E EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,--The experience ot many years with a nativeinfantry regiment in IndiA enables me to offer a few remarks on the important subject treated of in your leading artiole this morning, viz., the relations existing in the Compan's army generally between the European officers and the SePoys under their command; and as I believe, from the tenor of your remarks, and from observations I have frequently heard in society lately, a somewrhat nistaken opinion exists with refesenoetothin veryseriotu matter, per. haps you may not deem a few words from one who haB given much attention to the subject unworthy a place in your widely circulated journaL Comparisons are drawn between the relative positions of offioers of the Royal army and their men, and those of the Company with theirs, but any mn of Indian experience knlows how unfair is anysuch reasoning. Theym,pathy, the feeling approaching to social intinacy existing between Europeans cannot poesibly be found or expected between natives and their Einglish officers. That the latter, as a body, do feel an Interest in their men, that they take a pride in their appear. anoe and efficiency, that they exert themselves to promote their health and comfort both in garrison and on the mprch, I am prepared to maintain; but to expect that closer and more intimate relations can be successfully c ltivated is to expect too much-in fact, impossibility; neitherdo I believe thatit would be desirable. The total difference of our habits of life, the imperishable distinctions of religion-that fatal barrier to any social interoourse-the neceary impression to maintain in the natve mind that we are physically and intellectually a seperior raoe, a conquering people-all these reasons render a very intimate communion both inexpedient and impracticable. Familiarity would undoubtedly breed contempt; and, while I strongly advocate and would invariably inculcate on the minds of European offioers the extreme necessity of treating with patient kindness those under their oontrol, of listening with interest to theirrepre. eentations, and blending affability with firmness in their demeanour towards natives, I at the same time 'would wish the English public to understand that the conquerors and the conquered caunot further mingle; that to carry out a system of equality and to estsblish a community of thought and feeling between European and native is to dimnish our authority and under. mine our power. The fearful crisis now e3r'Aing is in no degree attibutable to the incapacity of regimental offioirs or the absence of sympa-hy with their men, and, though the discipline and constiution of the Bengal army have been faulty in the extreme, it is to the ALlful blindness of those in power,who would take no warning and no ateps to remedy the evil, that we owe our prewnt oalamities and humiliation. What misfortune might not he expected from the government of those who could leave the great arsenal of Northern India without even a corporal's guard of European troops? Could such infatuated blindness or unpardonable negligence be imagined or conceived ? One remrk I would beg to add with reference to an obServation in your article this morning which leads yor readers to believe that the drilt and disecpline of a native regiment are entirelyin the hands of the native offioers, You have fallen unintentionally into a serious error. The drill and disciplneare quite In the hands of the European oficers, particularly the commanding officer and adjutant, and, beyond ocoasionaily commanding a company on parade or on detachment, a native officer has little or nothing to do with It. I remain, Sir. You mort obediRnt o m r-.t. A RETIRED OFFICER. Aug. 18.
