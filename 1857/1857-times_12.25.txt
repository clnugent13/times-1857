NA YAL GUNNERY. Among the documents issued annually by the United States Government is an Interesting report on naval gunnery by Captain D.%lagren, of the Ordnance ship Plymouth. After recapitulating the improvements in ordnance, and the various experiments made by his Govermment, Captain Dahlgren gays:- "The Bureau then adopted the 9-inch sbell gun for the gun decks of these vessels, but unqualifiedly refused the pivot U-inch deslgned for the spar decks, mounting in lIeu^ thereof 8-inch of 63 and pivot 10 inch. And there the matter might have remained for time or accident to decide, so long as the question was limited in its application to our own uavy; but other Powers have been prompt to follow the example set by the United States and to improve on it. They have constructed ships yet larger than the Merrimac class, and given to them greater speed and cannon of heavier calibre." He therefore considers it imperative on the Govern. ment to be well assured that its ships' batteries are establshed on a sonnd basis, and have their due extension. The armament of the Plymouth, which was chosen expressly with reference to the attainment of some satisfactory d&ta whereby it might be ascertained to what extent the weight of the new ordnance diminished or Interfered with Its efficient management at sea, as well as the di&'overy of the means best calculated to remove or abate such evil That object had been to a great extent attained. On board the Plymouth,besldes the daily drill, there were fired, under various circumstances of wind and sea, 12 L shells from the 11-inch0 and 230 shells from the 9-inch gans in broadsides. The results in connexion with those previously obtained at the experimental battery lead him to the following general inferences:- "1 L When the ship has no motion, or but little and is without inclination, the 9-inch gun can be worked and fired, nearly, if not quite, as rapidly as the long 32-pounder orthe 8-inch of 63 cwt., a succession of shells having been discharged from a piece of this description (mounted at the experimental battery, and manned by 12 men, the crew of a 32-pounder) at intervals of 40 seconds-a celerity not easily surpassed with a 32-pounder. "2. Where there is motion or inclination of the decks the working of the 9-inch ipn is proportionately retarded, and the celerity of fre diminished , yet,even under the disadvantage of an inclination exceeding 5' and reaching to 18' at the extreme roll, a well-drilled crew was able to fire these shells at intervals of 65 seconds and 35 seconds. (General quarters, to test the time in which the battery of the Ply. mouth could be brought into aetion.) " 3. When the ship is still and on an even keel the 11 inch gun cannot he fired as rapldly as the 9-inch, perhaps no faster than once a minnte; but the motion or inciunation of the ship that seices to decrease the quick working of the 9-inch gun is exerted less favourably on the 11-inch, so that It is proportionally more controllable under such circum. stances, and in manoeuvring can be aimed much more rapidly. On one occasion 13 shells were fred from it, starboard and port, while the two adjoining 9-inch gens together only fired 17 shels; the 11-inch gun being also at the disadvantage of having to pivot from one side to the other when the ship was tacked, to keep the target under fire. In this lnstance the wind was light, but the swell considerable, so that the ship rolled 7' to 8' and pitched 3S-target distant 800 to 1,000 yards. " 4. No difficulty occurred during the crulse in making the 9-inch and 11-inch gans perfectly Aecure in the roughest seae Coming from England in October and November, a continuance of boisterous weather, occasionally increased to a gale, afforded the most satisfactory evidence in this respect " On the whole I have no hesitation In affirming that as a pivot-gan the 11-inch Is in every way as manageable as the 64-pounders, which have been so long, and are now, used on board our steamers. "I And if this be correct there should ibe no objection to restoring that part of my plan of armaament which assigned a tier of 11-inch gans to the spar decks of the screw frigates, for which, too, there may be a more imperativereasonenthe fact that until this be done the ordnance power of those ships wil not only be less than what it should be, but even inferior to that of some foreign screw frigates of inferior dimensions. Certainly the present spar deck batterfes of the Merrimac class are altogether unworthy of being placedthere. tIt may be observed with regard to the retarding induence of the shins inclination on the heavier ordnance that in general it is reduced to a minimum before going into action, because it is then customary for vessels to diminish their CanVass to the least quantity with which the ship can be properly handled. And we may look for a further abatement of the evil to the Introduction of steam, which has become a prime necessity to every shin-of-war in battle. No more sail will then be spread than ill be required to give steadiness to the vessel, andtheincEination of the decks will be comparatively inconsiderable. Again, the opportunities of firing with correct aim are so far delayed by the interposition of smoke aud the constant motion of the ships, that it is hardly probable that the heavy cannon now in question will fail to be prepared when those opportunities offer." To insure proper results with ordnance as heavy as the 9 rnd U1-inch gunms, Captain Dahlgren urges, more careful dril and intelligent direction, are required than with lighterguns, forit is to be understood that, though certainly attainable, more difficulty in doing so will unavoidably be experienced in proportion as the cannon are heavier. Science may achieve its utmost in perfecting the cannon and their appointments, but if the crews are deficlent in kidU and practice better men with inferior means may bear away the palm. Though tho crew of the Plymouth were, with few exceptions, all seamen and above the average in respectability and education, the number which could be trained into well qualfied gun-captains was exceedingly limited. Captain Dablgren points out the immense importance of enlisting none but sailors of the first-class; no inoen - tive should be omitted that can properly be offered. The difficulties in obtaining good men have been perseveringly overcome by England and France. On this point he says *- "Some discouragement has been experienced from the anticipation that many who enter and qsalify may subseuently decEline to re-enter, which no doubt wlll happen. ut, so far from viewing this as an objection, or even as a difficulty, I should consider It only as a temporary inconvenience, which had its ulterior advantages in diffusing among our seamen a skill in their peculiar arm which must eventually tell to the benefit of a maritime Power whose avowed policy is and has been to recruit its resources in war from the seamen and vessels of the commercial marine. In England a like result is not left to this accidental sourco only, but especial efforts are made to train the great mass of those whose business is on the water, and ships with competent officers are provided for the purpose. One of these, a friRate, lay near the Plymouth when at Southampton, and I witnessed the drilling of a number of men, who would remain for a term and then return to their vocations, It appeared to me a derided improvement on the 'Inscription Maritime of France, to which it is probably a counterpart. No doubt it can be made an object to most of our seamen who qualify as gun-captains to continue as such in the navy, and those who leave may some day render good service in the armed ships of the Republic, private or public. Wben such simple expenditure is made to train and arm our citizens for the common defence ashore, and one of the best military academies also contributes its quota to the same purpose by the return of cadets to private life, there seems to be no valid objection to a system which incidentally makes some, though slight, provision for the military training of our citizens afioat." Captain Dahlgren announces the near completion of a mannal adapted to the manipulation of the two-truck carriage. He strongly urges the constraction of a screw corvette for the prosecution of further experiments. In support of this suggestion he gives the following reasons:- "In the course of the practice at sea no one could fail to remark the unavoidable difficulty of keeping the target within the lateral scope of the guns by inan(euvring with sails only, and how much loss of time was thereby occasioned. The sugenior efficiency of steam under such ircumstances -would ave been Invaluable. Undoubtedly, no ship of war can be considered complete which is unfurnished with this motor, while its assistance would compensate for an inferior number of guns, and in many cases confer an irresistible advantage over an opponent. "The present practice of the great naval Powers indicates a remarkable unanimity in this respect, notwithstanding the cost consequent upon the use of steam. No ship of war id now constructed in England without a power .of this kind. The official list shows that of 548 vessels composing the navy of that country 289 have steam, of 188 vessels in commnission 126 (or two-thirds) are steamers, beside 18S steam gunboats. Many important facts, not procurable in any other way, would be obtained if the Department would authorize the use of one of the old ships as a target for shell practice, Perhaps there is no better purpose to which some of them could be !pplied. " The Plymouth has exhibited excellent qualities during the eruise. She sails wel in light winds, and also in fresh ales, as there was oceasion to observe when embayed on the .nglish coast, and obliged for safety to bear a heavy press of canvass; ;works well, rolls easily, and is very comfortable. The construction must be admirable, from the fact of her carrying, without strain in the heaviest sea, a pivot gun which, with its carriage, weighs ]2. tons, on a space where no such burden could bave been anticipated, and where the only additional support was a single stanchion - while the cutting of a large post (eight feet by four fect) on each side just opposite must have detracted from the strength of the fabric. Nordoes it appear that the repeated shocks of firing so heavy a gun have produced the least effect on the construction." Having concluded his report on the experiments made with the ordnenee of the Plymouth, Captain Dahlgren proceeds to give an account of his visits to foreign naval arsenals. After glancing at the carnon foundry of Liege, he de. scribes the Woolwich Arsenal as follows:- "The new feature of this department is the contemplated fabrication there of iron ordnance, for which the most extensive arrangements are making. This was initiated, I was told, during the late war with Russia, previous to which all iron guns had been furnished by private establishmnents. I am not aware that the official reasons for this change of policy are known authentically, but presume it originated m the deficient endurance said to have been exhibited at times by English cannon during the severe and protraeted service to which they were exposed In various operations of the war. " This measure is no doubt considered as the first step In. dispensable to improvement, and perhaps as a specific for the evil; but I much doubt If it can of Itself have the effect In view; the succem that may follow wMll be due rather to the ability of the men who shall have the responsIbilIt and also ample discretion in the premises ; and they would have obtained equal results in the old mode, with equal power to control its management. "In countries like the United States and England, where individual enterprise has such immense development, it is hatdly to be advised that the Government should voluntarily separate itself therefrom. It may by so doing be better able to Bgard the work againDst the injurious influences of the contract system, but the certain consequences of roatine in men and measures wil more surely, though less openly, produce greater evils. Let the private opera. tion he supervised with as much care as that of the Governinent, and there wiU be no reason to be dissatisfied with the results. " A. small experimental department wouald be highly boneficial, where obscure and dl cult invesgatlons should be scientifically conducted and the standard of material and workmanship indicatea as well as the terms of con,tracts determined * but there its functions ought to cease. To go further will be to incur the danger of routine, that bane of improvement xwhich of itself would be ruinous to the best-conducted private enterprises in the world. "It would be difficult for me to convey by description an adequate idea of the qanatity and excellence of the machinery that I saw being put up in the now and spacious building designed for it. Whatever the ingennity of the day could suggest to make perfect seemed embodied there, and welsustained the reptatnion of the private establtshment (Napiter's) where it is said the work was designed and "Still more, however, than the best machinery will be required to make good cannon. The purpose of the new undertakng must be accomplished otherwise than by the finish, which, indeed, Ls unexceptionable now in ordnance every. wbere. Andif tbe views whicharepatforthattimegaunoflicially really represent the opinions of those who will direct the management of the Government foundry, the results desired may not be obtained immediately. Of course the little by which I can judge in advance precludes any positive state. ment. The fragments of the mortars which had burst so readily in bombarding Sweaborg were lying about, but the fractured surfaces had been too loDg exposed to the weather to permit one to estimate the quality of the iron; howeve-, I saw some samples afterwards taken for examination, and am only surprised that the pieces were ever allowed to go into service. I also observed some new breech-loading cannon of enormous weight, which are soon to be put under trial. "We now passed ontside the waDs of the Arsenal to the practice-ground, in order to look at the enormous mortar which is in course of preparation there. It is of wrought iron, and, composed of several parts, is Eaid to weigh with its accessroies some 50 tons, has a base of 36 incbes, and throws a shell of 26 cwt., which is about the weight of a light class 32pounder. The desig ais by Xr. Mallet, the author of a very able work on the endurance of cannon and the mortar is supposed to have attracted the favourable attention of a high political functionary. The mower of such a projectUe It would be difficult to conceive. " Just near by a well-equipped battery of Horso Artil. lery was preparing for practice under the eye of General Sir W. Williams, who ig the commandant of that arm. " In an apartment appropiated to the purpose the examination by mechanical test of samples from metal for bronze and Iron ordnance was being executed. The machine used for tensile strength is precisely similar to that so long since adopted in the United States for like purposes designed by Major WVade, formerly of the iUnited States army. " Iwas also shown the extensive department that had been appropriated to the manufacture of Lancaster shells. Cast iron had been found too weak to withstand the enormous strain of first displacement, and wrought-iron shells were proposed; but the cost proved to be so excessive as almost to forbid their use. The drill of English mechanics a last overcame this difficulty, and a mude was devised for making wrought-iron shells at a very reasonable rate. Bat the ample means provided are now idle, and the workshops silent. Samples of shells in the various forms through whch they must pass were e.xhibited, and one could not but remark on the ingenuity displayed. "I was favoured wilth the company and explanations of Mr. Anderson, the Inspector of Machinery, until his presence was required at a board of which he Wa a member." Captain Dahlgren briefly refers to the laboratory, remarling approvingly on the extent of the establishment, "the product of which seemed sufficient to supply the largest armies and fleets." Various machines in operati-f1 excited his admiration. In the carriage department his attention was attraoted to the carriages for pivotingheavy ordnance. He remarks:- "'Upon the efficiency of this machine hinge the most important difficulties that obstruct the employment of large calibres. That of the English navy differs widely in many essentia points from our own, but, to my mind, not advantageously, and it would hardly serve to handle convenientl a gn of the weight carried by tho Plymouth (142 cvvt." Captain Dahlgren visited the gunnery-ship Excellent, which he describes as particularly well sitnated for experiments in gunnery. He went onb oard just as the afternoon drill was commencing. We give his own account of whas he saw:- "The battery was composed of the usual regulation calibres-32-pounders and 8-inch shell guns-and everything was in good working order, plain and substantial, with such indication of wear and tear as might be expected from constant use; not the slightest regard given to ornament or show of any kind. A brief summons by the drum brought the men promptly to the guns, a very good-looking set, and above the average, but not so much so as to be styled picked men. As a matter of course, they handled the pieces in capital style, with precision and accuracy in every movement, the orders being given by an ordnauce lieutenant, while an instructor was stationed at each gan. The exercise was by no means short, ay,d the men were allowed to pause at intervals for rest, which the very spirited character of the drill rs well as its continuance rendered no doubt quite acceptable. At one of the 32-pounders were quartered several lieutenants of the navy, members of the class then studying on board the Excelfent for a gunnery examination. They did the duties of captain, of general, sponger and haun ike men, by no means as a mere ceremonial, but in go earnest, and with a vigour which generally made the movements of their gun remarkable even bere, where skil and celerity were the order of the day. No men that I saw worked with more zeal and animation than these lieutenants, who, by the way, were good-looking fellows, stripped to trousers and a knit shirt. Beside the ordinary manual, they shifted their gun to another carriage. I supposed that they volunteered for drill, but was informed to t econtrary-it was a part of the course, and was repeated more than once in the week. " There was perfect attention given by every man, and no voice heard but that of the directing officer. Placed at the extreme of the broadside, was to me an object of special interest, because it indicates the direction which the British authorities propose to followin solving the question of heavy calbres in broadsides, whie the drill with the piece enabled even a casual obse-ver to form some idea of the degree of success which might probably attend the undertaking. The gun itself weighs some 10,000 pounds, or two-thirds of a ton more than the United Statesbtoadside 9-inch gun, and it tbrows a shot of 67 pounds, with a charge of 16 pounds. It was designed, and has always been used, as a pivot-gun, being the equivalent for the United States' 64-pounaders mounted on pivot in our large steamers. But now that some ships of other Powers have been armed with broadside guns of heavier calibre than usual the British authorities have given their attention to a corresponding move, snd bave armed some of their new screw frigates with 10-inch shell guns in heu of 32-pounders and 8-inch guns, It is also asserted that 68-pounders are to be similarly applied. As for the carriage of the gtn so little difference meets the eye between it and that which forms part of the pivot system (English) as to convey the idea that for the advantage of simplification the letter had been merely transported from the slide to the deck, and thus might be explained the first use in broadside of rear trucks acting eccentricaUy, which, however, do not appear to have answered the purpose on decks as weU as on the slide, judging from the fact that they are disused in the Excellents driU thrhtilj.p'-,-- and have alsobeen omitted inthe new roadside carriages or batteries of 10-inch with slight exception. Thecarriageis nowof the same seriaption as that used by the French and ourselves for heavy cahbres in broadside, which was devised by hL MarsiUly, Chef de BataiUon, and tried on board the Dryade in 1835. The 68pounder was worked by 18 men, and the difference in celerity between it and the neighbouring 32-pounders was so trifling that my attention would not certainly have been drawn to the gun on that acoount. So that if this result is to beaccepted as testing the facility of manoivre, it can hardly be refused as satisfactory, and seems to have been so far accepted by the British authorities as to induce the trial of the 10-inch of 87 for the broadsides of some of the newv screw frigates. After the gun exercise the men were asseiabled on the spar-deck and drilled with short muskets or carbines. There might have been 80 or 60 men under arms, divided into four sections, each under one of tho lieutenants, who had been working the 32-pounder, the wvhole dril being conducted by a non-commissioned officer, probably of marines or marine artillery." The visitor was much gratified with the attention and courtesy shown him by Captains Hewlet and M'Kenzie. At Chatham he inspected the steam-frigate Mersey, 40, ii course of construction, of which he says: "The dimensions above given are considerably greater than those of our Merrimac-class, and nearly, if not quite, approach those of the Niagara. The capacity of such a hull to unite the highest rate of speed and power of battery is very ample. What the steam power is to be is not stated, but the 40 guns assigned by the official register must needs be of the heaviest caUbre; it is reported 68-pounders of 95 cowt.on the gun,deck, but I heard nothing on the subject that was authentic. There can be little doubt that with any reasonable success in applying the capabilities of such a vessel she must become the most formidable of ships of war." Captain Dahlgren also inspected the Diadem, 32, and was on board of her when she made her first trial trip Hlis report is as follows:- "Registered on the official list as a screw-steamship, 32 guns, 300-horse power, and exhibits a finished sample of the larger class of new British screw frigates that are designed to rate with our Merrimac-class, being complete in aU appointments and commissioned for service. "She is by no means as large as tlhe Mersey, and is even inferior in size to the Merrimac, if the dimensions given by the nautical periodicals are correct-viz., between perpendicelars, 240ft. ; breadth extreme, 48ft: tonnage, 2,500, The gun deck affords fine roomy quarters, evenfortho massive cannonmountedthere. Thedistance between theports (nearest Si s) being 18ft., while the size of the ports, like the guns themselves, is extraordinary. The pieces which 1 s3w mounted on this deck were 20 10-inch sbell guns of 87 owl., being in reality the original of our owvn 10-inch gnun adopted from the Englishin 184, anud yet to be seen playing the part of pivot-guns in the Mississippi, dacoedonian, and Constellation. The exterior figure of the English gna has, however, been remodelled so as to conform to that of the ordnance generally, These guns are mounted< on the two. truck blarsDly carriage already described in speaking oF the Excllent's 6-pounder. It differs from the copy which I made of the original for the 9-inch guns of the new United Statees frigates in havlng the rear transom to rest on the deck instead of the brackets as already explained, while the roller handepike ships a litUe on one side and the training tackle hooks as much on the other. These carriages are un. usually low, which is by no means undeeirable if not in oon. Blct with other requirements, and the guns can be elevated 140 or depressed 8', so ample are the dimensions of the ports4 There areno csentri1 recrtruoks except inthatpair of car riages which is abreast of the hatches, closed by the bulkheads for the convenience of the steam, and where it is probable there mlaht be some embarrassment with the roller hand. spike, which is, however, the only resort of the 10-inch guns, and is longer and much heavier than our own. On the spar-deck are 10 32-pourders of 53 cwt., mounted and equipped az such guns usually are, and two 68.pounders Or 95 owt., one at each end. These last are on pivot carriages resembling our own in the general principle only of a care riage moving on a slide, to which It u compre-ed in recoil. In detail the difference is very considerable - the slide is much shorter, and Instead of bolt and socket the connexion with the deck is established by a plate attached to the fore end of the slide, which plays on a hinge, so as to torn down and allow the hole in it to drop over a bolt in the deck, which is so rounded for the purpose that its head resembles that of an acorn. These bolts are placed permanently in the deck wherever it is intended to i*ot the slide, and the plate when turued up against the yore end of the slide lies flush wvitb its surfawe, so ES to pro. sent no projection. The compresser Ia applied to the rear transom, the latter being extended underneath from the bracIkets sufficently for the purpose, which explains the contact of the transom with the deekinsteadof the brackets when the carriage is transferred from its slide to be use& In broadside. The fore trucks have fixed axle, the rear act eccentrically by attached levers, to which hook the side tackles. The upper surfaco of the raU is faced with a wide iron plate. Alf of these arrangements seemed to me infe. rior to our own, though this may not appear so markedly with such pieces as 68-pounders. " The after pivot-gun is stowed athwart the deck, directlyforward of the propeller wheel, which is without a trunk, as In our ships, but is closed by a flat hatch flush with the deck-plank when the screw is submerged, so that the slide traverses without obstruction, and enables the gun to command the entire sweep of the stern, which is well opened' for that object, and thus half the purpose in having a stern gun is not uselessly sacrificed, as it is in the United States screw-frigates. "According to the official register the engines are of 800 horse-power. They are by the firm of Maudslay, have two cylinders of 82 inches and 4-foot stroke. The boilers are fitted witl horizontal tubes, and the length ooun Ied by the whole eteam power was id to be about one-thgd that of the ehip. The consumption of fuel at full speed is not yet ascertained. No bunkers on the berth-deok, but only below it, which might contain 450 tons. The stowage ofi water inconsiderable, but a distilling apparatus was relied on to furnish a supply, which with one pound of coal was assumed to produce 9 or 10 pounds of drinkable water when the engme was not In motion. "When I visited the Portsmouth yard on the 29th of September the Diadem was alongside the wharf, receivg with alldespatch the final details which were to com lobe her equipment for sea, under the eye of the officer wtho I to command, Captain Moorsom, so weU known as the in. ventor of the English percussion shell, and he politely in. vited me to witness the first trial trip. "This took place on the 2d of October. About half-past 9a.m. the Diadem was hauled out of the basin and steamed deliberately down the harbour towards the roads of S'it. head, the draught, 204 feet aft, being some 10 inches13 when fuly laden, atd caudsing the upper edge of the screw-blade to be slightly exposed. " About half-past 10 o'clock the ship ranged along the measured mile in Stoke's Bay, but no observation of the rate was then made because the engine was not at full speed, and the makers desired to attain this gradually. I chanced, however, to note it for my own satisfaction, and found that the mile's length was passed over in 5 minutes and S zeconds, belng 119 knots per hour. Water smooth, wind moderate and right a-head; the last of the tide favour. able, and estimated by the pilot to be about one knot per hour, engine making 41 revolutions, with a pressure of 11 pounds. " The vessel was now wore round and crossed over to. wards Ryde, then headed out to sea by the eestern passage themachinery working with case, draught good, temperature of engine-room perfectly agreeable, that of the furnace-room high enough, but not more so than in our own ships. " At noon the Diadem, being outsidce in the open channel, was put round, heading back into harbour, the engine being now up to 48 revolutions, and about 1 o'clock was approaching the nearer station of the measured mile, when a counterpol in the maehinery gave way, upon which the makers of the engine decidod to postpono further trial of the full speed, being properly unwiling to do so under a disad. vantage so easily and permanently reparable as that just encountered. The ship was, therefore, put round, steamed to Spithead, and nchored near the Ganges, 84. "As the engine is said to be capable of 55 revolutions, I see no reason to doubt that the speed of the shlD at load draught of 21 feet would be less than 12 knots. "The Diadem is a warlke-looking vessel, sbip-rigged, though less heavily masted and sparred than usuaL " The screw is hoisted, not by the spanker boom, but by sheers stepping on the spar-deck at each side of the well the legsarereadily separable, and, being short, admit of being conveniently stowed out of the way. "TEwo other ships (one building) are styled on the official list, like the Diadem, ' screw steamships, 32 guns, 800-horse powver,' and I am told are of the samue class, butt am without any authentic information to that effect, "Another type of the screw frigate I saw in construction at the Woolwich-yard, named the Galatea; but no vessel answering to the name or class appears on the official list. All the framaes were up except a few at. the extreme, after end. The length was said to be 280 feet, which is about that of the Diadem; whether the resemblance extended to the other dimensions I was not informed, but they were certainly those of a large ship. As well as I could distinguish there were indications of 24 ports on the gun-deck,andI was told that the spar-deckwould helight except at the ends, where It would be made strong enough to bear a heavy pivot gun. If correctly informed, then, there would be 26 guns, all no doubt of the heaviest description, as would befit so large a ship; but what they would be my conductor was unable to say. "These three ships-Moersey,Diadern, and Galatea-maybo considered as embodying the views of the British authorities in relation to the types of build preferable for screw frigates of the largest size." The latest style of the screw sloop class were represented, he says, by two ships which he saw on the stocks. " One of these, nearly completed, at the Chatham yard" is a fine-looking hull, said to be about 200 feet long, and ot 3,500 tons; is styled on the register, ' steam screw corvetta of 21 guns and 400-horse power ;' has sharp ends and a flat floor; is planked up outside, but the decks ar not entirely. " The beds ready for the engine, but no part of it in yet; the aftermost section of the shaft was, however, fitted to the bearings in tho sternpost. " The propeller is to be hoisted, but there is no trunk (or continuation of the propeller well above the spar-deck), and thus a clear sweep is left for the pivot gun when mounted aft, the stern and quarter-posts for which seemed, however, contracted. " It is said that the battery will consist of 20 S-inch of 65; cwt., and one pivot 6S-pounder of 95 cwt., carried forward or aft, as may be convenient. I could not but notice the planeness of her deck, so advantageous in working guns, and Indeed indspensable when on pivot. I under. stood the name eobe Charybdis, but am not sure. The Challenger is the name of another ship of a like clas' and also borne on the register as a ' screw steam corvette, 21 gans, 400 horse-power.' I was told that the dimensionSa and form were the same as those of the Chatham ship jest mentioned, the difference being that this vessel is to have a light deck, strengthened at the ends to bear a pivot gan. The propeller Is designed to be lifted by the spanker boom. Though these are the latest and perhaps the finest of the English screw corvettes, the class is by no means so recent as not to have undergone trial. On the contrary, three are in service, four more have been completed, and three are buildin,g, from which It mlay be inferred that the resultsa are in general satisfactory. There is also another new class of screw corvette, rather lees in size, of 17 guns and 200 horse-psowecr,onfwhich one is in service and four are now in Captain Dahlgren paid particular attention to the gun, boats, of which he says:- " This is a class with which we are entirely unprovided, and yet of great interest to us, by reason of their adaptation to the shalUow waters of our southern seaboard, where heavier vessels would be entirely useless." Captain Dahlgren concludes his report;as follows " I saw many new shls of the heaviest class, such as the 91-gun ships and larger, but it is needless to enter into any particular description thereof, because the naval policy oE the United States renders them almost useless, and there is little ingenuity required to apply their great capacity pro. fitably, whether to accommodate guns, steam, men, or Nor need this paper be unnecessarily extendec! y entionig details waich came under my notice, hut belong to the technicalities of other branches, except in a few particulars that more directly interest or concern the convenience of the battery. u nus It seems to be the invariable practice in the late British ships to plank the gun-decks with oak from the waterway nearly to the combings of the hatches, intended to obviate the greater wear to which the decks are liable by the use of the two truck carriages and heavy calibres. lt may be, however, that the choice which is to be had in this country of excellent pine may not require the samo pro. c%ution in our own ships. in many of the new Britisx vessels, I observed the greater planeness of the decks-s convenience for all classes of guns, but indispensable for the heavier calibres; nor will the most perfect carriages and! apparatus nor the best-skilled crews avail with pivot gans of the first order if the constructors will net furnish this essential requisite. The after pivot gtn is also unobstructed in the new Enghsh ships of all classes by the trunk or con- tinuation of the propeler well; yet all the screws h ist in every class of vessel, from the sloop upward, When own the flat hatch covers the opening, and the gun pivots right over alL. In all our new screw frigates the after tpivot gun is thorn of half its power by the presence of thu " While at Lisbon the Dutch screw frigate Wassenar arrived, just completed, and on the trial trip,-a fine war. like ship of 2,400 tons, but presenting no novelty of design or detail; carries 44 guns, 30-pounders and S-inch shell-guns, wvith a pivot (68-poundei) on the forecastle.

DR. L I7IGSTON'S DISCOVBRIES IN SOUTrERN AFRICA. (Gorn"ned from SThe. Time of Nov. 21). In estimating the amount of difficulty sirnounted by Dr. Livingston in the performance of his, great exploit-the crosing of the entire continent of South Tropical Africa-the reader must not forget to take into account the hardships he was comDelled to undergo in reaching the base of his operations, Idnyanti, the capital of the friendly chief of the Makololo, without -whose support all progress to the north would have been hopeless. 'Xo arrive at this place from Kuruman-itself the frontier station of misionary enterprise when he first went to Africa-occupied him more than six months, although no longer encumbered with wife and children. On arrlving in latitude 19°16' he wFas brought to a standstill by African fever. All his party, except himself and a Bakwain boy, were laid up by it. Fortunately, two or three days before he fell in with a number of bushmen, who proved very serviceable in his emergency. The boy managed the oxen and the doctor attended to the sick, keeping the Bushmuen in good humour by going out occasionally with them and shooting a zebra, or buffalo. Sickness was not the only danger to be apprehended. The luxuriant growth of the grass in the hot weather aucceeding the rains always has a peculiar effect on draught oxen. They became uneasy from fear of surprise by wild beasts, and one night during the detention occasioned by the fever, the sight of a hyena made the whole of the Doctor's cattle dash away into a trackless forest in the neighbourhood. The boy followed, and nothing was seen of either during the whole of the next day and night. On the morning of the following day, which was a Sunday, the ]ad returned, bringing about 40 head with him. He had found them late in the afternoon of Saturday, and been obliged to stand by them as a guard all night in the midst of a region full of wild beasts. " It is wonderful," says the Doctor, " how, without a compass, and in such a country, he managed to find his way back at all." During his last visit to the Cape with his family, Dr. Livingston appears to have received some in. structions from Mr. Maclear, the astronomer there, and to have been suDplied by him with instruments to enable him to lay down the geographical positions of important points. These, in the latter part of his journal, are frequently noted; but in tropical Africa the atmosphere is so often clouded that the opportunities of taking an observation occur very rarely. If the atmosphere were generally clear, the intense power of the sun by day and the dews consequent on the radiation of heat from the earth by night would perhaps render the neighbourhood of the equator literally uninhabitable. Even as it is, the description of the heat is someterina fearful. At lat. 20°- south the thermometer at the surface of the ground in the sun marked 1250 Fahrenheit. When the bulb was sunk three incbes below the surface it rose to 138. The hand cannot be held on the ground, and even the borny soles of the natives' feet must be protected by sandals of hide. The water in the ponds at the surface is 1000, but the thirsty traveller contrives to get a cool draught by taking advantage of the fact that fluids do not readily conduct heat downwards. He walks into the middle and lifts up the water from the bottom 'with his hands. ln order to reach Linyantiwithout passing through the region of the itstse the poisonous fly which is so fatal to cattle, Dr. 3Livingston pursued a course directly north. This involved a great deal of pioneer's work, for the route lay through a thick forest, and the feebleness of his convalescent companions throw the duty of felling trees chiefly upon their master. Here he was again fortunate enough to fall in with some Bushmen, who showed him a pool of water wben his own stock was exhausted, and assisted hini in recovering his oxen, which again had run away in a fright, this time occasioned by a licn. The lion has a great dread of Bushmen, who track him after he has made a full meal, and shoot him with poisoned arrows. The poison is made of the entrails of a small caterpillar, called Nkriza. A very small portion introduced into a scratch acts like morbid matter in dissection; but the agony is so great that the person wounded becomes a raging mania,, and flies from human habitations. The efcts on the lion are no less terrible. He is heard from far off moaning in distress, and in his rago bites the trees and ground. The Bushmen cure a poisoned wound by rubbing fat into it, and explain their mode of treatment by saying that " the Ngwva wants fat, and when it does not find it in the body, kills the man." At last, after many other perils, Dr. Livingston arrived at Linyanti on the 23d of May, 1853. The whole population, consisting of some 6,000 or 7,000 souls,turned out to welcome him. Sekeletu,the son of the deceased chief Sebituane, a young man of 18, no less friendly to the English than his father had been, received the party in what is considered Royal style. A number ot pots of beer of the country were set before them, and the Court Herald, an officer of consideration but very various duties, stood up, and, after many antics,-for there is Court etiquette even in Central Africa,-roared out the appro- priate forms of reception at the top of his voice, I " Don't I see the white man? Don't I see the comrade of Sebituane? Don't I see the father of Sekeletu? We want sleel) (peace from war); give your son (Sekeletu) sleep, my Lord." Indeed, the position of Sekeletu was not a very safe one. His father had appointed Mamochisane, his half-sister, to succeed; and another near relative named Mpepe was very anxious that she should continue in the chieftainship, while he himself exercised all real power under her name. But Mamochisane struck a death-blow to the intriguer's hopes. She insisted on resigning her dignity in favour of her half-brother; and the discontentedMpepe, foiled in his scheme, retired to Nariele, the capital of the Barotse, who are a people subject to the Makololo tribe, and was there believed to be practising magical arts for tho purpose of causing the destruction of the young chief. In fact, he had built a hut for this wicked purpose in the timae of Sebituane, who appears to have attributed his own death-really brought on by smoking a pernicious narcotic-to the mischief brewed in the witch-hut. But the villain now resorted to means much niore formidable than sorcery, in order to attain his ends. Influenced by the slavedealing tribes whose interests had been menaced by the policy of Sebituane and his son, he determined to take off the latter by assassination. The attempt was made while Dr. Livingston was on a tour with the intended victim a few weeks after the reception just mentioned, and his presence appears most providentially to have been the obstacle to its success. Mpepe paid the penalty of his guilt with his life; but the ferment which his death caused among the B3arotse, through whose country Dr. Livingston's intended route lay, had the effect of inducing him to remain some time longer at Linyanti. This town, which our traveller mnade the base of his future expeditions, having acquired such influence with its people and chief as to be able to command all the assistance it was in their power to render him, lies upon a river of considerable magnitude named Chobe. It is one of the affluents of the Zambesi, into which it falls after a very tortuous course of more than 200 miles below the town, bringing with it most of the drainage of an area comprised between the parallels of latitude 13° and 180, and the maeridians 18S and 23°. The point at which it enters is a little below Sesheke, where the Doctor first caught sight of the Zambesi. This stream it was his intention to pursue upwards until it should bring him into the vicinity of the western seaboard. His frieuds the Makololo now put a question which the formidable nature of his proposed task rendered a very pertinent one:11 In the event of your death, will not the white people blame us for having allowed you to go away into an unhealthy, unknown country of enemies ?" To obviate their fears, the Doctor proposed to leave " a book" with them, which, if he did not return, was to be sent to Mr. Moffat, and would perfectly justify them in the eyes of his countrymen. The "1 book" was, as may be supposed, a volume of his journal, and it is an unfortunate circnmstance that this care for the reputation of the Makololo was the cause of its being lost to its writer; foras he was long without being heard of, the volume was delivered by Sekeletu to a trader, and all subsequent trace of It lost. The fears of the Makololo were certainly justified by the personal condition of their guest, no legs than by the dangers of the country he was about to traverse. He h.ad suffered from an attack of fever since hiE arrival among them, and, although he had recovered, his bodily weakness was still considerable. One manifestation of this was a strange giddiness when he looked up suddenly to any celestial object; everying seemed to rush to the left, and if he did not cateh hold of some sbjeck he fell heavily to the ground. Yet in this condition, the beat season for travelling having arrived, he determined to set out with the resolttion " to succeed or perish in the attempt to open up this part of Africa." He had with him 27 natives, subjects of Sekeletu, of whom two were genuiuo Iakololo, and the rest natives of other parts of Central Africa. For his people he took three muskets, and a rifle and double-barrelled smooth bore for himself, a small Gipsy tent just large enouah to sleep in, a sheepskin mantle as a blanket, and a ho.serug as a bed. A Bible, nautical almanac, and set of logarithmic tables, a sextant, thermometer, chronometer watch by Dent, of the Strand, and two compasses constituted his theological and scientific apparatus, unless we should include in the one or the other a rnagic lantern, which was found exceedirgly useful on several occasions. Depending for subsistence mainly on the supply of game, and anxious to lighten his baggage as much as possible, he took only about 201b. of beads to barter for food in case of necessity, and about the same quantity of coffee, tea, and sugar. Onevery curious provision must not be forgotten. A tin canister, about 15 inches square, was filled with spare shirting, trousers, and shoes, reserved to be put on when the party should reach civilized life. On the 11th of November the travellers left Linvanti in canoes furnished by Sekeletu, who had also made provision for their hospitable reception as far as his influence extended. After sailing into the Zambesi, which here goes by the name of Lecambye,* they ascended that river as far as the falls of Gonye, where they arrived on the last day of November. The river above the falls runs through a comparatively narrow valley, inhabited by the Baroise, the tribe which has been mentioned as subject to the Makololo. They are a race of boatmen, and traces of their occupation appear in their large deep chests and broad shouldere, while the lower extremities are much less develop' d. For several miles below Gonye the river is connned within a narrow space of not more than 100 yards ; the consequence is that in time of flood it rises no less than fifty or sixty feet there, and at all times runs in a boiling current. On arriving at this point the canoes were slung on poles and carried on the shoulders of the natives past the fals. The expedition proceeded prosperously, and everything appeared codleur dc rose, with the exception of one circumstance which might have proved fatal to the whole object of the expedition. A subordinate official of Sekeletu, named Lerimo, had made a foray with a party of his Makololo countrymen to the north in the very direction in which Dr. Livingston was going. The influence which the Doctor had acquired shows itself most strikingly in the circumstance that, although this outrage had taken place with the full sanction of the headman (or vice-chief) of the Barotse, he was able to prevail upon Sekeletu's mother to disown the act of the indiscreet officer and return the captives which had been made in the ill-starred expedition by his own hand. Thus he was enabled to turn the very misfortune which threatened to frustrate his plans into a confirnation of the message of peace on earth and goodwill towards men, which it was his object to proclaim. Still, on arriving 30 or 40 miles north of Libonta (lat. 140 59%) the frontier town of the Makololo, he thought it prudent to wait and see the result of the explanatory message which was sent, together with 11 of the captives, to Makoma, the chief whose subjects they were. This caused some delay, but the game in the neighbourbood was abundant, and the party fared sumptuously. Dr. Livingston has a personal dislike to the hunter's occupation, but was compelled to cater for the rest on account of the inability of his companions to take a decent aim. They were nervouis at the flash in the pan, and wanted hina to give them " gun medicine," without which no native of Central Africa expects to be able to shoot straight. To save hls ammunition, which his companions would have entirely wasted in learning, the Doctor was compelled to do all the shooting himself, and this necessity involved other inconveniences besides the shock to his feelings. At an early stage in his career he was bitten by a lion in the right shoulder (an incident of which he gives a very graphic account), and, a false joint having formed, he was ever afterwards compelled to shoot from the left shoulder, with less certainty of aim than before. The dialike of inflicting pain upon animals seems to have induced him to study the circumstances under which the deathshot maybe delivered most certainly; and he relates some curious facts bearing on this subject. His theory is, that a shock on that part of the system to which most nervous force is at the time directed proves most fatal. "I bave seen a rhinoceros," he says, "while standing apparently chewing the cud, drop down dead from a shot in the stomach, while others shot through one lung and the stomach would go off as if little hurt." But, to make quite sure of the rhinoceros, either black or white, the hunter should creep carefully through the bushes on the animal's lee-side, a'most importantpoint,which is ascertained by throwing up a pinch of dust every now and then, to within about 20 yards, then sit down, r-mi his elbows on his knees, and aim slanting a little upwards at a dark spot behind the shoulders, and his game at once falls stone dead. If, in the anxiety to keep himself concealed, the sportsman should inadvertently get to windward of his quarry, he would be forthwithcharged by the creature. Indeedthisis not his only peril. Dr. Livingston relates a story of a man who, while stalking a rhinoceros, happened to look' round, and saw to his horror that a lion was sIoikirFy himra; he only escaped by springing up a tree like a cat. When the breeding impulse is upon these animals, and a man happens to pass to windward of them, both lion and lioness will rush at him, but under ordinary circumstances Dr. Livingston asserts that the lion is a cowardly animal, and never attacks a man except stealthily, unless wounded. A very curious peculiarity about him is, that at the very last he will not make an attack where he sees anything to produce the suspicion of a trap. A horse belonging to Captain Codrington ran away, but was stopped by the bridle catching a stump. He remained a prisoner during two days, and when he was found the whole space round was marked by the footprints of lions, which had evidently been afraid to attack the haltered horse from the fear that the whole thing was a snare. It is a common belief that the lion when he has once tasted human flesh prefers it to any other,1 but the real state of the case is that a man-eater is always an old lion, who has grown too infirm to catch game ; he resorts to villages for the sake of the goats, and if a woman or child happens to go out they fall a prey too. This being his only source of Enbsistence, he of course continues it until the villagers despatch him-a work of little difficulty. On the 27th of December Dr. Iv*ingston arrived at the confluence of the Leeba and the Lecambye (lat. 14° 10' 52", long. 23° 35' 40"), and thence sent to another chief living nearly due east, to whom also he had some captives to restore. This chief, Masilio, was said to be in the habit of seizing aU orphans and others of his own tribes who were without powerful protectors and selling them to the Mambari slave merchants for exportation by the west coast. The Doctor sent him a message, " that he was not so wise as his father, who had wished to govern men, whereas he, Masiko, by selling his people showed his desire to govern wild beasts only." He then proceeded up the Leeba as far as the influx of the small stream Makondo (lat. 130 23' i2"), where he arrived on the 1st of January, 1854, amid heavy rain, the season for which had now fairly set In. This is the point at which the Mambari cross the river on their way to Masiko, and one of Dr. Livingston's men picked up a bit of steel watchchain of English manufacture, which had been brought thither by them. The Maambari are enterprising merchants, and bring Manchester cottons into the very heart of Africa. The natives, in their wonder, cannot believe them to be the work of mortal hands; and the information acquired from the Mambari on the subject is not likely to enlighten their minds, however it may satisfy their curiosity. The English manufactures are said to come out of the sea, and the beads to be gathered on its shore. The Doctor tried to correct this impression, but apparently with little success. To explain to savages the production of a manufacture by a desCription of machinery is a striking example of the principle obscurum Jper obscuri us. The objection wras obvious-" Howv can the ifrons spin, wveave, and print so beautifully V" Dr. Livingston left the river at this point, and continued his journey by land through the country of the Balonda. Hle had at last got among the real negroes, with wool on their heads and bodies, thick lips, flat noses, elongated heels, and very dark skins. The Bechnuaas are of a coffee and milk colour, with a European frame, ancd physiognomy. Nothing appears to have earprised the Balonda more thaan our traveller's straight bair. An explanationof thephenomenonwassuggested to them by the idea that he, like the wonderfil fabrics, ' had come out of the sea,' and his own party, unwilling to waste so good a joke, afterwards 'always represented him as a merman, whose lank 1. cls displayed the effects of the sea water, which was his natural element. The Balonda had at first supposed him to wear a wig made of the hair of some animal. But a stronger contrastthan that of person -was presented by the habits of. the two races. The Bechuanas have neither idols nor any form of public worahip, bat among the Balonda every village has its idol, and fetishes are met with at every step. Artificial hives are placed in the trees and secured simply by a " piece of medicine" tied to a tree, which effectually deters all thieves. When a female chieftain, whoreceived the travellers very hospitably, was about to cross a stream, her confidential doctor, who was in close attendance with his basket of " medicines," waved some eharms over her before she ventured on the water. One of the MIakololo talked rather loudly in the immediate neighbourhood of this basket, and was reproved for it by the wizard, who himself always spoke in a low voice, glancing back to the sacred package as if in fear of being heard by something inside it. The relative rank of the sexes, too, is quite reversed. Sebituane, the Makololo chief, had intended his daughter and successor to treat the men of his tribe as he had treated the women, and select a husband for herself at her owa discretion. But this was so opposed to Bechuana habits of feeling that the individual selected was actually called her wife; and the annoyances arisdng out of the popular criticism of this anomalous relation operated powerfully in inducing the lady to abdicate in favour of ber brother Sekeletu. But among the Balonda female lordship is the most natural of ideas; it seems to prevail all across Central Africa north of the Zambesi. When Dr. Livingstone reached the neighbourhood of the Portuguese settlement on the eastern coast he had bargained with a native to be his guide in consideration for a hoe. Unfortunately, the man went to show it to his wife, and presently returned, saying she would not let him leave her. " Then brink back the hoe," said the doctor. " No, I want it." " Then go with us and you shall have it." "But my wife won't let me." One of the party who followed him to his hut heard him say to her " Do you think I would ever leave you ?" and then, turning to his visitor, "Do you think I would ever leave this pretty woman? Is she not pretty 1" Inhappily, this high estimation of the fairer sex, although it deprives the Teutonic races of their claim to the monopoly of gallantry, is not accompanied by any other of the characteristies of civili2ation. The chief who exercises a supremacy over the whole of the Balonda under the name of Mutiamvo, whose residence is at Cazembe (a town laid down from the reports of native traders somewhere about lat. 10° 30' and long. 270), appears to be cne of the moat reckless of despots, scarcely, if at all, removed from the character of an absolute maniac. This at least was the case with the individual who died just before the expedition of our traveller. He had a whim sometimes of running a-muck in his town and beheading all he met until he had quite a heap of humian heads. Occasionally, when he was supposed to need some special charm, a man was slaughtered for the sake of a particular part of his body. If he took a fancy to anything in the possession of a stranger, he would order a whole village to be brought up in order to purchase it by the sale of the people. Frequently when a slave trader came he would take possession of all his goods, and then, after 10 days or a fortnight, send out a party who pounced upon some considerable village, killed the headman, and paid for the goods by selling aU the inhabitants. These slave merchants were invariably themselves men of colour, generally half-caste Portuguese. From the time of their leaving the Leeambye the course of the travellers was northwardsuntil arrivinc, at Lake Dilolo (lat. 110 33', long. 22° 27'). Thence their route took a westerly direction, and in its general bearing continued W.N.W., aU the way to St. Paul de Loanda, on the shore of the Atlantic. The goal was reached on the 31st of May, and by the successful achievement of the first part of his perilous undertaking Dr. Livingstone was enabled to dc for the geography of South Tropical Africa what bis illustrious fellow-labourer in the field of science, Dr. Barth, had done nearly contemporaneously for the northern portion of the torrid zone. Both have d emonstrated that wheremountains weretraditionally believed to exist there is in reality a widely-developed system of rivers, which afford fair promise of access to the interior of the country. Lake Dilolo, just mentioned, is most singularly placed. It is a natural summit reservoir in the midst of an extensive plain, which itself forms the watershed separating the affluents of the Leeambye, or Zarabesi, from a portion of the headwaters of the Congo. Its elevation above the sea level is no more than 4,000 feet, and yet, while from its southern extremity there proceeds one of the feeders of the great river which falls into the Indian Ocean, there issues from the northern end a stream which is an important tributary of the Casai, a river that, after receiving nany contributions, unites its waters with another of equal magnitude (the Quango) flowing northwards: and the two, after a considerable course, during which they receive a further accession of waters from the equatorial regions, at last pour their united stream into the Atlantic, under the name of the Congo or Zaire. Such an aelievement as that of which we have given a sketch was not to be performed without much suffering. The elevated plains through which the Doctor passed were all flooded by the periodicod rains, and he was constantly wet through. One attack of fever followed another, and at the time he reached Loanda he was more dead than alive, in spite of the greatest attention on the part of the Portuguese settlers for the last month of his journey. The Makololo who had accompanied him were treated with no less kindness than himself. Their remarks on what they saw were extremely curious. The sea, of course, struck them wzith amazement. "Wle believed," said they, " that what the ancients had told Us was true, that the world had no end,; but aU at once the world said to us. ' I am finished; there is no more of me."' A house with two stories had always been inconceivable to them. The nearest point to which they had arrived was the notion of two huts one on the top of the other, and they had then felt puzzled to conceive how men could live in the upper story with the conical roof of the lower one in the middle. In describing a house of the Doctor's they said," It is not a hut; it is a mountain -with several caves init." An English brig-of-war was in the harbour, and they were invited on board and allowed to fire off a cannon, Dr. Livingstone "improving" the occasion by tellng them, " That was what the English put down the slave trade with." They were also taken to the service in the church, and remarked, "that they had seen the white men charming their demons," a phrase identical wlth one they had used on seeing the pagan ritual of the Balonda. Dr. Livingstone returned to Linyanti by the way he had come, with the exception of making a detour in a part of the central plain in order to avoid some of the chiefs who had treated him very ill on his wayout. He arrived there in October, 1S55, after an absence of nearly two years, during which he had undergone 27 attacks of fever, and perils both from man and wild animals. One of the greatest of the latter befell him just before his arrival in the territory of the friendly chief Sekeletu. He had got quite out of the way of shooting, but his party having been for a long time without animal food, they landed from their canoe one day with the determination on his part of getting so close that he should not miss. The ganme was a zebra, and he unfortunately only broke one of the hind legs, the loss of which did not hinder the animal from going off in a gallop, followed by his men. The rest of the Atory shall be told in his own words:- "As I walked slowly after the men on an extensive plain covered with a great crop of grass which was laid by its own weight, I observed that a solitary buffalo, disturbed by others of my own party, was coming to me at a gallop. I glanced around, but the only tree on the plain was a hundred yards off, and there was no escape elsewhere. I therefore cocked my rifle with the intention of giving him a steady shot in the forehead when he should come within tbree or four yards of me. The thought flashed across my mind What if your gun misses fire ?' I placed it to my sboulder as he came on at full speed, and that is tremendous, though generally he is a lumbering looking cimal in his paces. A snail hush and banch of grass 15 yards off, made him swerve a little and expose his shoulder. I just heard the hall crack there, as fell flat on my face. The pain must have made him renounce his purpose, for he hounded close past me onto the water, where he was found dead." There now remained, in order to complete the task which Dr. Livingatone had imposed upon himself, the comparatively easy achievement of exploring the course of the Zambesi eastw,vard to thxe sea. He left * Both words simply mean " river' in different looal d3alecta. Linyanti for this purpose on the 3d of November, and arrived ia safety, although again weakened by fever, in the Portu&uese settlement of Tete early in the following February. The attention he received from the authorities here was equal to that which he had experienced on the west coast. By Iheir kind aid he was enabled to reach Quilimsane, although in miserable plight from the effects of longcontinued fatigue and privation upon his health, on the 20th of May, 1856, and to reap the glory of having, first of any European, traversed tropical .A frica from shore to shore. Our space prevents us from giving even a sketch of this last journey, but ihere was one portion in it which must be noticed. Important as the navigation of the Zambesi is for commercial intercourse with Central Africa, there are several points at which an interruption occurs from rapids, which render the transshipment of goods a necessity. At one of these the obstacle is caused by a wonderful cataract, which, putting all circumstances together, is probably the most astonishing natural phenomenon in the world. The whole river, which at the time the Doctorsaw it was nearly atitslowest,pours intoafissure of the basaltic rock that foruts its bed there, and at the bottom is forced to take a direction at right angles to its former one. The lips of the fissure are only 80 or IOO feet apart, and the effect to the eye is that the whole body of a stream as broad as that of the Thames at Limehouse vanishes suddenly in smoke ! There is an island on the very edge of the fall, and to this Dr. Livingstone was conveyed in a canoe, and, "c reeping with awe to the verge, saw that a stream of 1,000 yards broad leaped down 100 feet, and then became suddenly compressed into a space of 15 or 20 yards." Without approaching thus near to the gulf, the existence of the river cannot be perceived at all. The columns of vapour which arise were visible five miles off, and the natives, whose awe prevents them from going near enough to examine the locality, give the place the appropriate name of Mosiobunya ("'Smoke sounds there.") Dr. Livingstone conferred on it the title of the Victoria Falls, and indulged in the very pardonable " vanity " (if his own phrase is to be used) of carving his initials and the date of his visit upon a tree on the island. But mindful, as he habitually was on all occasions, of the interest of the children of the soil, he also selected a spot upon it suited for his purpose, and planted therein about a hundred peach and apricot stones, and a quantity of coffee-seeds. The continual moisture from the spray furnishes a security for the proper irrigation, and If it only escapes the ravages of the hippopotamus there seems ever prospect that our traveller's little nursery will be, as he hopes, the parent of all the many gardens which will come into existence in this new region, should its resources be rendered available by means of the discoveries which have rewarded his courage and perseverance.
AERATED BBEAD. (From the Spedator.) The Engllsh are a great people; the 19th century is a great century. No question of that. The bitterest enemies of both or either are yearly compeUed more frankly to do homage to the achievements which mark them out as different from all other races and all provious centuries. In innumerable respects, too, there Is a sort of partnership In this greatness. A peculiar people and a peculiar time play, so to say, into each other's hands, and contribute to make each other what they are. But all strength has its weakness, all greatness has its drawbacks. There me things in which this notable and progressive age has not shown itself progressive; and some of these in regird to which England lags behind most civilzed nations-possibly even behind some that do not boast to be civilized-as much as she outruns them in other respects. Exempli gratid, let us take what in this eountry is called the staff of life"-in France, still more expressively, " la Un6diceton de Dieu." The proceas of breadmaking does not appear to have altered much since the time of the Pharaohs; and such improvements as have been made EDgland has been the slowest to adopt. English bread is the astonishment and despair of foreigners, continental bread the constant theme of traveUers' praise; while as regards those collateral preparations of wheaten and other grain which largelb supplement the use of fermented bread in other parts of Europe and surpass it in powers ol nutriment, England has notning either in respect of new Inventions or immemorial tracitions that can be placed on a par with them. It may be doubted, indeed, whether any part of Europe is on the right track in respect of the manipulation and nue of cereal products. There is no more painful misgiving on the sabject of our much-vaunted clvili. zation than that which arises from the gradnal substitution all over Europe of white bread for brown, or black-a less wholesome and nutritious kind for one raore so. Justly looked upon as one of the surest tests of an advancing civilization, does or does not the use of white wheaten bread, as ordinarily made, imply a deterioration in the staple nourishment of the nations? Or granting that it does so-owing to defects in manufacture or tricks of trade-need it continue to do so? These are questions hitherto discussed pretty much en amnateur, which one day or other society wiU be caUed on seriously to determine. At present the question is vastly more pressing for England than for any other country; and for reasons by no means difficult to define. First, the nse of white bread is the rule in England, and is rapidly becoming so in Ireland and Scotland; while in most other countries it is little more than the exception. Secondly, the processes of Engllsh breadmaking are inferior and the adulterations of the material more glaring. Thirdly, English wheat is unquestionably deficient in gluten, its chief nutritive element, compared with continental wheats grown in warmer climates; nor can theimportation of foreign wheats more than partially supply this defect. Fourthly, the EngUsh make much less use than most other races of the preparations of grain, and sometimes of roots, which supply what is defective in the bread of other countries as the " staff of Jlife." Oatmeal, barleymeal, macaroni, polenta, hominy, haricoti beans, lentils, we might also say potatoes, are mere luxuries or accessories of the table in EDgland; while in other countries they are staples of food, and make the mass of the population comparatively independent of variations in the price or defects in the quality of wheaten bread, Flfthly, there is much less home grinding and home breadmaking in England than in any other country, and consequently the misohlef done by such adulteratlons as are prevalent has a much wider scope. This last peculiarity, like the first, is the natural and inevitable result of improved facilities of intercourse, greater division of employments, and the predominance of a town population. The others are of older standing, and mnore bound up with the peculiarities of our climate and character. We are not required to enter into the somewhat trite, but still very far from exhausted discussion, how the alum and other ingredients with which bread Is adulterated injure the health of the population, and tend in the longrun to deteriorate the race. There is the less occasion to do so just now, because if some sanguine people are to be credited we are on the eve of a revolution m breadmaking which will effect all that is required, and rid us for ever, by one and the same process, at once of the adulteratlons oE the material and defects in the baking, which have hitherto had such a baneful effect on the health of the people. Since, some five-and-twenty yea-s ago, an enterprising company erected a large factory in Pimlico with the siew of utilizing tLh alcohol that is generated in the process of baking, we do not remember that any proposed improvement in the manufacture has excited so much attention as that recently invented by Dr. Dauglish, and carried out on an extensive scale by Messrs. Carr and Co., of Carlsle. No doubt, if the invention sucmeed, the revolution will be a thorough and decislve one. Hitherto all the improvements proposed in breadmaking have either taken for granted the necessity of fermentation, or sought to replace it by some cyhmiical process, of which the harmlessness was, to say the least, exceedingly questionable. Dr. Dauglish goes more effectively to work, and, by a simple enough adaptation of processes familiar for other uses, dispenses with al recourse either to the brewer or the ohymist, and undertakes to produce bread of a quallty superior to any that is made, without any other ingredients than flour, water, and salt. There are few articles of consumption that have seemingly less analogy than bread and soda-water, or other effervescing liquors; but Dr. Dauglish's patent is pretty much the same step in the process of breadmaking that was gained by using a machine to charge liquids with carbonic acid gas. The flour is placed in a strong iron vessel somewhat sitmUaT to a Papin's digester, and moistened with aerated water from an adjacent condenser. Then, for the brief period of eight minutes the dongh is kneaded by machinery inside the vessel. The veessel is then opened and the gas contained in the water with which the flour has been mixed, liberating itself when the pressure is withdrawn, instantaneously expands the flour into five or six times its previous bulk; and behold, the raising of the dov.gh, so tedious and laborious by the old methods, is completed ! The process is undeniably a rapid one. Its other advantages are set forth by the patentees as follows:- " 1. There is a Laving of the whole of the wease caused by fermsrnttlon, which averaRes funly I0 Der cent. Thns 10 per cent. more bread is made out of a aacS t f lor tban by the old prooea. 2. The process, instead of occupying elght or ten houes, is completed in half an hour. 3. The cost of machinery and gas Is less than that of yea3t uesed In the old process. 4. The dough requires rearcely anY handling to form It into loaves. 5. The bread Is absolutely pure; it is simply flour. water, and saIt. Finally, should the whole of the broad in the kingdom be thus made, a saving would be effected of an amount equal to our entire importatlion of foreign wheat," Could all these advantages be realized, there would doubt. less be a great deal to say in favour of the invention.

DISCOUNTS. TO TE EDITORw OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-It is an impre5ion extensively prevalent-indeod. I believe almost universal-4hat the disoounting of biUls aad the making of similar advances by bankers are operations involving only the transfer of mnoney from one party to another, the aggregate amount remaining still the same. I The belief exists in such quarters and is enunciated by such authorities that it may appear presumptuous to question it, yet I have no hesitation in expressing my belief that it is not founded In truth. If this he so, there is evidently inu volved so enormous an amount of consequent misconceptioa of the commercial results of these transactions-carried on to, the extent they are in this country-that it will be no loss of time to examine the grounds upon which I have arrived at so strangely opposite a conclusion. Sir P Poel in his speech of Dec. 3, 1847, is reported to have sald, "What are joint-stock banks ? They are nothing more thau intervening agents between those who possems capital and those who employ It." And It vas stated by Mr. Wilson in the same debate, that "the only funds from which a banker can discount bills are of three classes: first, his ovm capital; secondly, if his bank be a bank of issue, his circulation; thirdly, deposits." Now, not only do Icon. sider that this is not true, bat, startling as it may appear, that biUs are not discounted by bankers from funds otherwise in their posession, but that (sabject to such limitation as I will shortly explain) bils do of themselves form a fnnd out of which they are discounted, and that they thns are a clear addition to the money (or that which is reckoned as money) otherwise in existence, in so far as bankers are con. cerned. To make this evident in the simplest way I w,il suppose that all the banking business of the community is conducted by one great establishment, all other banks being merely branches, and I will suppose that A, having an account at this bank, and having drawn a bill upon his customer, pro. cures it to be discounted at the said bank or any of its branches. The result of tho discount is this :-the proceeds of the biU are placed to the credlit of his account, and the I bill itself is placed to the debit of another account, bearimn Some such title as Bills Receivable. Now, in thlis stage the transaction is clearly a creation of so much money, for both the assets and the liab9itles of the bank are so much greater, and A has so much more money at command than before, as effectuaUy as if so many sovereigns had been placed to his credit Instead of the amount of the bilL But it will be said that A does not procure discount of the bill for the purpose of keeping the money lying in the bank, that he will at once pay it away, and that for this payment the bank must provide funds; so that the transactionbecomes a mere employment of his previously existing money in discounting the bill. But by following A's payments we shaU see that the character of the transaction is not thus changed. A draws a number of checks to B, C, D, &a., and as these parties also keep accounts at the same bank (it being assumed that there Is only one bank) the checks are at one and the same moment placed to the debit of A, and to the respective credits of B, C, D, &c., being only transfers of balances or portlons of balances from one accourt to another, and in this stage of the transaction therefore, and in every future gtage until the final extinction of the bill, the bank remains in the same position as it was immediately after the discount-that Is, with an increase of its assets and liabilities; its customers also remain in a similar position, there being the additional sum distributed and circulating among them. The extinction of the bill will take place in a corresponding manner, merely by the transfer of balances or portions of balances, and then the original position of the bank and Its customers (in the aggregate) will be restored, unless, as will probably be the case, the increase be restored by the recurrence of a similar transaction. But it will be said that I have no right to assume only one bank, for that B, C, D, &c., may keep accounts at other banks, to whom therefore the first bank must pay the money, and thus place itself in the position of having dis. counted the bil out of funds previonsly in existence. Bat, in assuming the existence of many banks, we must also assume them all to discount bills, the balances arising from which must be distributed among all; and thus It will naturally happen that each bank will receive upon an average as large an amount from bills discounted by other banks as it wiU be required to pay out in respect of biUls discounted by itself, and therefore it wiUl remain precisely in the same position as it was shown to be immediately after the original discount of tho bll for its owvn customer. To make this more clear, let us assume that aU the discounting business of the community is performed by 100 banks, that each has an equal sharo of business, and that the amount to be discounted is 7,000,0001,, or 10,0001. for each. The commencement of the transaction on the part of every bank is to place 10,0001. in various sums to the credit of a number of Its customers, and to debit a like sum to BiUs Receivable. So far here isa creation of 1,000,0001., which I am to assume the various parties concerned put Into circulation at once by means of checks, thus causing the whole amount to distribute itself indiscriminately among all the customers of aU the banks. Now, since each bank has discounted an equal amount and has an equal extent of business, it is evident that in the general distribution each must receive in checks upon other banks an amount exaotly equivalent to that which it wil have to pay in respect of checks drawn upon Itself, and thus the position of each wiU remain the same as it was immediately after the original transaction, its assets and liabilities being increased 10,00017, and its customers having, until the extinction of the bills, the use of a like sam more than was previously in existence; or, more correctly, the customers of all the banks having the use of 1,000,0001. of additional money. Nor wil this result be disturbed bythe circumstance of the banks being of unequal magnitudes, for, practically, each wil of necessity, discount, be drawn upon, and receive in proportion to the extent of its business. It may be urged as an objection that a bank may discount bills and be required to pay the proceeds at once in cash, and that such a transaction is no creation of money, but simply an Investment of funds previously in existence. This is perfectly true; but as T am seeking to show that the discounting of bills is a creation of money only so far as the proceeds remain balances in the hands of bankers, I might dismiss this objeotion altogether. Yet it may be as well to observe that no man discounts a bil for the purpose of keeping the money in his pocket, but to pay to some other party; and as every man having a business has also an account at a bank (with few exceptions) the money in question wil soon be absorbed in the general mass, consisting partly of bankers' balances and partly of circulating cash. But, in fact, transactions of this kind are too few to deserve especial notice in an aggregate of many millions, and since we know that the cash oirculation (meaning notes and speoie) remains within a few millions always the same, while the amount of bills under discount wll fluctuate to a pro. digiously greater extent, probably some hundreds of millions, we may safely assume that the balances arising from this source (so far as the internal trade of the kingdom is con. cerned) retain the form in which they were origlnally created, circulating from bank to bauk until the blUs arrive at maturity. It must be especially observed that the power of creating money by means of discounts is confined solely to bankers, and results from the circumstance of balances in their hands circulating from one to another by means of checks, and without the intervention of money in its tangible form. If a private indlvidual discounts a biU he will provide the meansaeither by diminishing his cash or his balance, and thus the whole amount of money wiU remain the same as before. It is the same In the case of biUlbrokers, but since the great bulk of the biUs negotiated by these gentlemen is ultimately discounted by bankers, the result, as a creation of money, is pretty much the same-the amount of tho creation, not the principle, being only affected. It must also be observed that the power of each bank to create money in thi way is limited by the extent of its ovn business, or, speaking more definitely, by the extent of that portion of the aggregate balances which in the general distribution will tall to its own share. To illustrate this, let us suppose the establishment of a bank, and (that we may not be confased by the various kinds of business usually carried on by banks) let us also assume that it is in the first instance entirely withottt capital, deposits, circulation, or funds of any kind, and that its operations are to be confaned to the discounting of bills and the keeping of ordinary accounts. Now, let a number of persons bring to this bank a quantity of bills, say to the amount of 10,0001., which, being discounted, form balances to that amount at the credit of the respective parties. Now, it is clear that so long as these individuals circulate this 10,0001. bv means of checks among themse ves only, the bank will remain precisely in the same position, tho aggregate balances being 10,001,, although each individual balance may be continually varying. Bat some of these checks wiiU faU into the hands of parties not oustomers of this bank, and wvil consequently be presented to it for payment, and, on tho other hand, it vill receive checks upon other banks, of which it will obtain from them payment; and if these two sets of checks exactly balance each other, the position of the bank, as having created 10,0001., is stiU unaltered. But if the customers of this bank pay to the ctustomers of other banks a larger amount in the aggregate than they receive from them, that is to say if they reduco their balances, then it is evident that this bank must provide funds to pay the difference' which can only be done by redLscounting some of the bills in its possession, and thus it will be forced into the samo position (so far as the creation of money is concerned) as if It had originally discounted only to the extent of that portion of the balanoes which in the general distribution wll fAllU to Its own sbar. What is true of individual banksil true 4 of all the bank. taken as an aggregate body. In addition to their other means of making advances, they posses the power, through the instrumentality of discounts, to create exacUy so much money as will continue in the form of balances in their own hands; that is to say, alU the money required at any one time for the purposes of the internal trade of the oonutrys In a period of groat prosperity, when the energies of the whole community are devoted to enterprise, when the rato of interest is low, confidence strong, and no one need want money who can draw a bill, this creative power is in. definitely increased. The great bulk of the proceeds of bills discounted must necessarily in its orizin circulate from hand to hand in the form of bankers' balances; and as the amount of these balances increases o wiU also the desire and the power of the banks to discount; for it muust be remebered that each bank, while it is in reality creating money, will, to all outward seeming, be engaged only in the employment of funds previously existing. The circumstances imparting confidence to one will produoe the same effect upon all, and, as each bank receives with one hand its portion of the produce of its neighbours' discounts, with the other It vill invest it in the same way, and thus money will continue to grow more and more plentiful, the rate of interest to fall, and prices to rise. Let us observe the steps by which this action and reacUton advance. I will suppose that there are two banks, A and B, enjoying in equal proportions the whole trade of one particular distriot, and that from a feeling of confidence, or some other caue which ve need not now investigate, A haz thought fit to discount for his customers to a larger extent than usuasay, to the extent (in addition) of 100,0001.-while his neigh. bour B, more prudent, has done no more than his ordinary amount of business. Now, it is clear that this l100,0001. wIl immediately begin to circulate between the two banks, and thatA wvll be able to retain in his own hands only a por. tion (say one-half) of the balances he has created, and thug 50,0001. wiU fall into the hands of B, who must of necessity employ it in some way. The twG banks are now in this position. A must convert 50,0001. of bills into money, and B must convert 50.0001. of money into bills, or some other security, and thus either by direct or intermediate action each supplies the want of the other. It Is evident that B has no choice in this matter, By a process perfectly in. voluntary and legitimate on his part, namely the mere increase of his balances, he findshimself in possession of more money than before, and he is absolutely without the means of knowing in what mode it was created. Ile at all eventl feels that money is more plentiful his confidence increase3 necordingly, and with it is willingnces to discount, and as a matter of course he also will contribute his share to the general enlargement. But thls happy state of things cannot last. Some part of the exaggerated enterprise put iqto motion by the abundance of money must take its couras into foreign and colonial markets; produce of all kinds wil begin to be imported in exce3s of export, and forelgnfunds, paying larger interest than our own, will be brought hither for sale. But these things cannot be paid for by the same medium which sufflces for our own internal trunsactlonz, and in the first instance the excess must be liquidated by gold. Here, then, is the turning point. The aggregate body of bauks cannot retain in their own hands the amount which they have created. It is no longer a transfer of balance from one bank to another, but a payment of so much hard cash. The banks required to make this payment lose at once not only the power of h.creasing their diecounts (which up to this point had been unchecked) but, they must of necessity diminish the amount already dis counted, and thus the rate of interest begins to rise and prices to fall, concurrently with the exchanges becoming adverse. Bat so huge a machine Is not stopped in a moment; the excess of imports continues for some time to increase. and the rate of interest to rise, and in proportion to the former wildness of our speculations will be the severity of the pressura at its culminating point. When a certain portion of money has left the country the powver of dlscount. Ing to that extent is absolutely destroyed; but the mischief does not end here. By the gradual rise in the rate of interest, and still more by the consequent fall in prices, many operations, previously giving rise to this discount of bils, become too unprofitable to be engaged in, and thus the amount of biUls and (as I have shown before) the balances created by them diminish in a much greater ratio than is indicated by the sum leaving the country in payment of Imports. After a time another element is introduced, In the shape of distrust, preventing the discount of many bills for which power may still be left, and by the concurrent and increasing action of all these causes the greater part of the bills discounted in ordinary times must inevitably disappear. At this moment it is probable that not more than two-thirds of the maximum of bills aTe In existence, and, if there be any approach to the truth in estimating this maximum at 500 millions, we are at this moment suffering under the absolute destruction of the chief circulating medium of the country, balances in the bands of bankers, to the enormous extent of upwards of 160 milons. It is not necessary for my present purpose to inquire whether these estinates be correct or not. It will be readily admitted that under certain circumstances, the amount of bils under discount is prodigiously greater than under other circumstances, while the amonunt of banknotes and gold is comparatively a constant quantity; and if (as I trust Is the case), I have muccessfully shown that the discounting of bills is the creation of money, or of that which performs for a time all the functions of money then It becomes obvious that to this system we are indebted for the tremendous alternations of abundance and scarcity, to the former of which we give the name of prosperity, and to the latter, according to its intensity, of pressure, crisis, or panic. T - J- A RETIRED BANKER,
TnE SOLAR ECLIPSES oP lS88.-On this subject M. Faye has just read an interesting paper to the Academy of Soiences with a view to call the attention of astronomers to the questions which may be either entirely solved or at least considerably elucidated by the observation of those important phenomena. What, he asks, is the sun ? It is a fiery globe composed of two concentric parts of very unequal densities. TLe inner part constitutes a spherical nuclens, and the outer one a kind of very extensive atmosphere. At a certain distance frona the centre this atmoephere is covered with a continuous spherical layer of a peculiar kind of clouds, which are luminoru and constitute the fiery globe visible to us, the " photosphere" of the sun. Under this principal layer there iH the comparatively dark surface of the nucleus, and above the photosphere there are the last highly rarefied and usually invisible strata of the general atmosphere. From the nucleus gasoous eruptions issue, partially dissipating and extinguishing the luminons clouds of the photosphere-nay, rising beyond it into the extreme strata (which only become visible by a faint light at the time of an eclipse), where they form those torrents of vapour known by the name of " rose-coloured protuberances." The volume of these vapours is sometimes 1,C0O, and even 2,000 times the size of ourl globe. M. Faye now draws a paraUel between the present condition of ihe sun as above described and what must have beeni the state of our earth when the crust which now conceals itp central fire was not yet formed. It was then a diminutive sun; the whole mass of its wates swam in the atmosphere nnder the form of steam, with the immense mass of carbonic acid which has since been absorbed by calcareous matter. These vapours, which were invisible and transparent in the vicinity of the then liquid nucleus, were condensed at a considerable altitude, so as to form a continuous involucrum of white clouds brilliantly illuminated by ithe rays of the sun. Seen from a distance our earth must have presented this photosphere to the eye. Immediately above it there must have been the last strata of air in a high state of rarefaction, and therefore incapable of supporting any of those luminous clouds or aqueous vapouzs; i.nmedistely below there must have been a layer of dark clouds or fogs constantly dissipated by the radiation of the nucleus; and lower still a dense atmosphere weighing upon the stiUl denser smoke, inces. santly issuing from the nucleus. M. Faye concludes this hypothetical picture by supposing that volumes of gas did at times penetrate through the photosphero, producing gaps in: tli stratumi of whito clouds; in which case a distant obeArver would, through these gaps, havm, seoa the dark nucleus of the earth, just as we at Present sea that of the sun through the sips in its pbotosphere, which appear to us as darklspts. low, whether this theory really explains theprocess actuallyin progress in the sun, ca. only be ascertained by an exact observation of eclipses. The eclipse of September, 18, wil only be central and total to the inhabitants of the southern continent of America, where there are but few astronomers and observatories. MI. Faye, however, proposes to establish two observatories for the occasion, one at Ignape, on the coast of Brazil, and the other in Peru, at 1A degrees south of Cape Blanco. But the first eclipse, which is to take place next March, though not central as regards France, will be very nearly so- for the spot whence it might be seen is only 32 kilometres from tbe Island of Onessant; and an observer stationed on that island will see the eclipse with a deviation of only 14 seconds from tho centre. At Brest the observation would cot be so favourable, the minimusm of breadth in the eolar crescent being 25 seconds; at Paris it will be 3 min. 22 sec., a very unfavourable condition for observing the physical condition of the sun. M. Faye now points out various precautions to be taken by astronomers in maklng th. ir observations, First, he advises them to divest themselves of all preconceived theoretical notions, which might induce them to neglect essential circumstances for others the importance of which may be mere matter of ophinon. They ought, therefore, to mark down the situation of the solar spots on the day before and the day after the eclipse, In order to see whetber they really coincide with the prottberances observed during the obscuration. Secondly, the observer should husband bis eyes-that is, avoid looking at the smn or receiving its direct rays, until the very moment of the observation-else he may be unable to see all the expected phenomena with sufflcient nicety. Thirdly, in order to avoid the irregular refractions caused by the air within the tube of the telescope, when rarefied by long exposure to the sun, the instrument ought to remain covered with a vhite cloth, having previously been pointed to the pro spot in the heavens until the moment when the obsevatron i to begin. This precaution, }L. Faye contends, Is of the greatest Importance, and Its being negle-ckd is the oause of frequent error. So great, indeed, is the effect of this rfra-o .ion that the disc of Saturn has sometimes been seen in the formof a,squacrse,with its angles slightly ronnded off.-

LO2VDOZ, FRIDAY, DECE3MBER 25, 18S7. Once at least every year the whole country is called upon to rejoice. Ciristmas is the home of the year. Thea al the force and action, movement, bustle, agitation, even all the thought and calculation of the year, come back to rest at the family fireside before they start abroad again; then all the spirits which ArunT set loose to puli at, teaze, tear, fret, and ruffle hunanity, to sneer, revile, ask awkward questions, stir up strife, and mal;e unpleasant work, return to their charmed circle on the green again, and rest before they recommence their several missions of malice up and down the world. For a short day or two now idleness is a duty-to some a hard duty. It is a pity that just the very persons who have the most right to be idle, and deserve tbe temuporary luxury most, should sometimes have ,most difficulty in enijoying it. But vast numbers, we believe, of highly respectable people are rather puzzled by an idle day or two. What shall they do with themselves ? Where shall they go ? Whom sball they see ? These are easy questions, and the external day is laid out unexceptionably; but before the sun is far advanced a listlessness is found stealing over the inner man. Is it that idleness, like other tbings, requires practice to make it perfect, and that it does not do to plunge into it all at once without previous preparation in kind ? That does not sound very moral teaching on nature's part, and therefore we cannot think it true, though the weaknesses of industry sometimes give habitual idleness an unmaerited advantage on this head. Your steady industrioum man cannot dismiss his cares at a minute's notice, and for a specified time; they follow him, teazing and importuning; he is in his shop or his warehouse stiMl in imagination, behind his counter or his desk. It is almost as difficult to be idle of set purpose as it is to sleep. Some great men-BoNAPARTE, WETLLTGToN, and I others-had the talent of sleeping whenever they liked. A perfect man of bn.iness ought to have something of the same power with respect to temporary idleness, which is wakeful rest instead of sleeping, rest. He should be able to throw off business for a time, dismiss cares, and stop the internal machine. This is really more business-like than helpless rumination over business, fighting battles over again, reopening past doubts and re-estimating past probabilities when the whole affair is over. For this morbid business.imagination the old heathen poet's remedy was wine; the Christimn poet's remedy is a more moral and philosophical one-a resolute mental holyday-" a wise vacancy." But Christmas this year has unusual difficulties. The Indian campaig has made gaps in many a social circle, which therefore meets now with very mixed feelings. Many a household cannot keep a "merry" Christmas; the joyous ceremaonial is sobered, the jubilant noise is subdued, and the seqsonable confusion and disorder tamed, by the recollection of an absent face. But Christmas, if it is not merry, may at any rate be chcerful and consolatory. The Christian festivity has not the fixed technical joyousness of the old Pagan festivals, at which everybody was obliged to be out of his senses with joy, or else he was doing the deity dishonour. Ours is no Bacchanalian festival with its fixed ecstasy and stereotypc'1 furor-it is a reasonable religious season of cheerfulness, according to the circumstances in which we are. If people cannot rejoice with thyrsus and ivy leaves they are not required to do so, they may keep the festival witiout noise or triumph, but still the season requires that gloom, if possible, shall be dismissed. There are different aspects in which such family losses may be viewed, some more clouded and others more cheerful, and the season requires that persons should at any rate dwell on the more cheerful aspects of such losses. This is always more or less practicable ; there is a certain selfmanagement about discplined sorrow which enableb it to modify its own re,cctions and regrets according as there is the call to do so, and Christmas is a calL The Christian festival is flexible and versatile, and accommodates itself to all circumstances, but still it has its rights and its powers. Family grief is not unsympathetic; it is affected by the atmosphere out of doors, and meets half-way the general holyday, the universal expectation of cheerfulness. An English Christmps has, at any rate, now the associations of a long traditional serenity about it; no sounds of war invade its sanctuary, no field of carnage defiles it. Whatever struggle England may be carrying on in the world, our own island is at any rate a sacred spot into which the demons of war cannot enter; we have peace within our borders, and Christmas is undisturbed in its English home. Let those who enjoy it remember how very different a Christmas some of our gallant defenders are passing. What are we to say of an Indian Christmas-a Christmaa at Lucknow, Delhi, or Cawnpore? People say that at the best it is difficult to realize Christmas in India, because all its home associations are wintry ones. It is a fireside festival, the cheer of which is heightened by the sound of the rough blast outside, and the celebrators of which feel themselves all the more snug and merry indoors from the contrast of the severity of a wintry sey out-of-doors. But India does not supply this contrast; a tamely mild air subdues the genial roughness of the festival, and gives it an unnatural, artificial, moderate thermonLeter temperament. Who can imagine a summer Christmas, a Christmas with leaves on the trees? One would fancy the world had become a large hothouse, and would be perpetuaUy looking for the distant sides and roof of the Crystal Palace, in which valetudinarian nature was passing its old age. No, Christmas is a winter feast. Probably many a past Christmas of this home temperature is passing now through the thoughts of the invalids at Cawnpore, who are contrasting the English frosty, peaceful festival, with their summer one amid the horrors of war, the loss of comrades, and feverish repose in hospital beds. And, if they think of us, let us think of them. Christmas is no season of selfish mirth, but of thoughtful and sympathetic cheerfulness-a cheerfulness, too, which leads to action, which opens the purse, and brings home to us that true responsible interest which every one ought to feel in his neighbour's lot. With these characteristic joys and duties, and this atmosphere of sentiment around it, the English Christmas is now-and it is a matter for just congratulation-enlarging its domain every year. Wherever our colonists go they carry their Christmas with them; they keep up with laudable jealousy the home traditions, and even hold the tighter by them from the fear of the relaxing effect of distance which they thus anticipate. The English Christmas is a minister to English empire. Once a-year at least all hearts revert simultaneously to England, and the emigrant pauses in the midst of industrial absorption and the engrossing interest of present labour and present enterprise to rccall the past, and to give a passing tender sentimental thought to the Mother Country. The English Christmas is thus an Imperial centre, around which once a-year all the sentimtent of the race gathers, giving something like sanctity and force to the relations of the Mother Country and her offsboots. It may be added, that at home too the English Christmas extends. The rail- ways, with that impartial zeal with which they minister to all departments, minister actively to the Christmas circles all over the country. They carry down everywhere crowds of solitaries whom a slower rate of trave'ling wouldhave kept at their distant posts, not making the transient taste of the home fireside worth their while. How many a bright spot is thus added to the field of memory! No pa;riot, and no legislator, no one who has the interests of society at heart, wlll undervalue such influences as these. They are moral influences, theyare purifying influences, theyexalt family life, and they create recollections and associations which always tell for good, and which last till death.
An Indian officer, who rose by his own deserts to the govern-ment of 40 millions of people, who maintained his position, if not his authority, in the very focus of insurrection, who expired at his post without surrender or defeat, and whose merits still survive in the affection and admiration of his frienda, is certainly entitled to the distinction of a memoir, and if the eulogy which " INDOPHILUTS " this morning pronounces upon Jo,n COLVIN should appear to a desultory reader somewhat professional in character, we can at least express our own belief that it is founded oDi solid grouads of justice. Mr. CO1vIN was au admirable servant of the 0onibany and the publio, and so completely is his biography identified with the political system of British India that -we shall have little difficulty in selecting a point or two I which, besides illustrating the qualities of the deceased officer, may be serviceably appLied to the more comprehensive questions arising out of this great Eastern crisis. One circumstance which will strike every reader, and to which, indecd, " INDornmus" has not been the first to make allusion in our columns, is the comparison which may be instituted between JoiN CoLvIN and JOHN LAwREoNcE. The name of the latter officer is now familiar to every inhabitant of the kingdom as that of the man who, if such praise can be accumulated on a sangle head, was the saviour of Ind;a. Yet in position, and, as would hive been irnagined before the mutinies, in power, Sir Joru LAwRENTcE was the inferior of MIr. COLVIN. Sir JoHN was Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and thus administrator of an extensive province, but Mr. COLVIN was Lieutenant-Governor of NorthWestern India. His government embraced the richest and most famous countries of Eindostan, and comprehendcd a fourth even of the enormous population of India. It represented a Presidency in itself, and, indeed, had at one time been so constituted, though the idea was never actually carried out, and Agra still remained a *lependency of Calcutta. The Lieutenant-Governor himself, as " INDOPHILUS' relates, and as every Indian k-nows, was able, courageous, and profoundly conversant with the special learning of his profession. Neverthelcim, when t.he rebellion broke out Sir JoHN LAwruEcp succeeded in preserving his province from disturbance, in maintaining his own authority unimpaired, and in despatching to the aid of our army before Delhi such reinforcements as enabled Sir ARCHDALE WlsoN to storm the city and stamp out the mutiny in its stronghold. Mr. Coxlvs, on the other hand, after putting out a proclamation which his superiors were fain to disavow, saw all around h;m overwhelmed in the torrent of insurrection, and could do little more than protect his own fort of Agra from the onslaught of the revolters. Now, how is this contrast of fortune to be explained? We admit much o-f what has been said about the fund,mental difference between the two positions, though the comparison has been pushed a little too far to Sir JoHaN LAw NCE'S prejudice. Beyond doubt, the Government of the NorthWestern Provinces became, under the peculiar circumstances of the rebellion, the most dangerous, difficult, and unmanageable of all the governments of India. In Bengal there w3s the prestige or central power, a strong European element in the capital, shipping in the river, and a population unwarlike in character, and totally unconnected I with the Sepoy class. In Madras there was no outbreak. In Bombay the administration had great advantages of position, the benefit of long warning, and not much mischief to deal with. At Agra every condition was at its very worst. The Government represented the nursery and seedplot of Sepoys. It was the very country from which they were levied-the spot on which they were sure to concentrate-the ground on which the grapple would take place. It is unfair, however, to depict the Punjab as a province ready moulded to our hands, and requiring only ordinary energy to elicit its resources. True, it contained few Hindostanees, and its proper population had no sympathies with the revolters; but if the Sikhs would not fight for the Sepoys it could not have been assiumed that they would fight for us. They had been our most recent enemies, and their territory represented one of our most recent conquests. All along the border were massed martial and predatory tribes, maintaining a chronic state of waxf-re with our garrisons, and regarded but 12 months ago as the most formidable adversaries of the Indian Government. In fact, the very tone and character given to the administration of the Punjab were based upon the idea that it was a post of danger. It was because our authority was thought to be always menaced in that quarter that all these strong garrisons were maintained there. Dismissing, however, cormparisons of this kind, and assuming for the moment that other conditions were similar, let us once more inquire what was the special circumstance which made JORN LAWRENCE SO strong and JoiN COLviN so weak. The answer ought to carry some valuable instruction for our future policy, and, as it happens, can readily be found. " INDOPLuSe" himself tells the true story. The Chief Commissioner had a force of European troops at his command; tlhe Lieutenant-Governor had none. In the whole of the North-Western Provinces there were but two battalions of infantry and a newly arrived regiment of Dragoons. At Agra, the seat of Government, there was one weak corps. This, however, is saying but little ; as, of course, any authorities possessed or superior force may control rebellion. The point to be noticed is the amount of force which sufficed for the purpose, and what was this? 'What was the balance of strength which constituted the difference between Lahore and Agra, and which enabled Sir JoHna LAWRENCE to display the energies of a conqueror, while Mr. CoLvIN was shut up in his fort ? Considering the results accomplished, the reader may well expect to hear of some powerful army-some irresistible array of British bayonets ; but " INDOPHILUS " remincds us that it was only 4,000 men. Seven European regiments, numbering ] probably lees than 600 effectives each, constituted the force which, after succours had been sent to Delhi, provided Sir JoHn LAWRENaCE with the means of disarming and terrifying more than 20,000 Sepoys, levying a most serviceable body of auxiliaries, and, finally, turning the scale in favour of Government and order. It is possible enough that if Agra had been as well garrisoned as the Punjab MIr. COLVIN's policy, and with it his success, might have been more nearly assimilated to that of Sir JOHN LAWRENCE; but we are compelled, as impartial cen- sors, to express our opinion that even the indispensable element of European force would have failed to give the Government of the NorthWestern Provinces that resolute and determined character which from the very first was visible in the Punjab. Mr. CoLviN did not discern the true nature of the crisis. Neither he nor others of the old Indian school could conceive that the outbreak was nothing short of a revolution, that it was the final catastrophe of a vicious system, and that tfhe "disturbances" so forbearingly talked about would end before six months were over in the abolition of the Sepoy army and the notification formally made on Wednesday last to the East India Company, thrt its rule must give place to the immediate authority of the CROwN. They looked, naturally enough, to the resioration of the old scene after the tempest had passed, and were proportionately reluctant to go to work too destructively in weathering the storm. Mr. COLVIN'S views with respect to mutinous Sepoys were perfectly defensible, on the assumption that Sepoys, whether mutinou or not, must continue hereafter to be maintained as they were before. He was afraid of "losing the army," little thinking that "the army" would be lost of itself, and that its loss would be the greatest gain British India could experience. "LNDiPniiU" conoluden with a warning, that if the old school of Indian officials is to be superseded by a new school professing less respect for the natives, we may soon see a revolt infinitely worse than the last. It may, of course, be possible enough to put the first part of this proposition in an acceptable form, but upon the whole, and closing with his argument in its substance, we avow our dissent from it entirely. As to the aggravation of danger, it is simply impossible. No Oriental country, and still lems a country like India, could, whatever might be the nominal strength of its population, appear in insurrection against its rulers with a force more formidable than that of 150,000 armed, organized, and disciplined revolters. We have seen the very wtorst of peril in this respect, and have conquered it under circumstances of surprise and weakness which we trust will never be seen again. But we must go one step further, and assert that the policy panegyrized by our correspondent was not calculated to place us in the position which as conquerors and civilizers we ought to have maintained. Against habits of conciliation and courtesy it is impossible to speak-we hope they may never be discarded; but the deference of our officials was cari ied too far, and reserved too much for the natives. There should have been more consideration for Englishmen, and might have been less for Hindoos. It was only as conquerors that we stood in India at all, and we might well have carried our claims high enough to avow our own religion and to do good with less fear. What, in fact, have been the actual results of the traditionary policy ? The population, as a population, has certainly not shown any repugnance to its rulers, but then, as far as we know, it never did so to any of its many conquerors. The class we selected for indulgence and favour has turned against us in all the wantonness of ferocity and treason; the resources of the country have been but scantily developed; enlightenment has made little advance, and the most, perhaps, that can be said for our century's dominion is that many millions of people have been kept pretty well disposed towards a commercial company wh-ch preserved internal peace among them and improved ih many respects their material condition, but in others of no small importance left them much where they were. Perhaps this, considering the arduous character of the problem, is no Blight praise, but we trust another century may produce stil more for India, and more for England too.
Theabominablecaseof "The Qunx?E v. RoBINsoN" has been brought to a very appropriate conclusion by the refisal of the jury to decide upon which side there was perjury, or the preporderance of perjury. Six jurors took one view of the case, and six another, upon each of the issues which had been left by Lord CA mPBELL for their consideration. Six jurors were for ROBinSON, six for EVA.Ns, upon the general merits. Under these circumstances they were discharged, with an expression of hope upon Lord CAMPBELL'S part thtt the question might be submitted to the consideration of another jury. In that hope we cannot concur. We doubt if the parties will obtain any other result if they multiply procceidings ad inftnithm, and in the name of the public we protest againet any further raking up of this iniquity. We have had a ful surfeit of filth, and for our own part can only desire that the nature of the business which we have urdertaken to conAuct permitted an entire suppression of any further report of such a case as that of " EVANS v. ROBrINso," or " The QUEEXN V. ROBINSON," or by whatever name it may be called. This, however, cannot be. We are bound to furnish the public with reports of the proceedings in aU our courts of justice; and so, if this case be ever brought forward again, we must again pollute our columns with a repetition of this thrice-told abomination. We entertain a hope that the institution of the New Court may in some measure relieve the public from having to read over and over again reports substantially identical of the proceedings upon which applications for divorce may hereafter be founded. As matters will hereafter stand it may be hoped that a single report will suffice. Thus, if these narratives cannot be altogether suppressed, at least they will be reduced in number, and there will not be a second and a third report of an inquiry which may be necessary to the interests of justice, but which must disguat all persons of cleanly feeling and right mind. Even under the new system, however, we shall be subject to a repetition of the infliction whenever, as in this case of "EvANs and ROBINSON," an indictment for perjury arises out of the original suit. Is this to be avoided? In the pressnt case ROBiNSON was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjiury, of wihich, as it was alleged, he had been guilty when making deporsition in the Arches Court of Csnterbury. Mr. EvANs had instituted a suit in that Court for a divorce, upon the ground of adultery commaitted by his wife with ROBINSO.-f, and the deposition upon which perjury was assigned was made by ROBINsON in opposition to that suit. Now, we do net mean to rake up once more aU the dirty detailrs of this dirty trial as they were brought out in their full signiiicance by the ingenuity of the professional gentlemen who were called to the work. We presume that our readers know all they desire to know of what is alleged to have taken place between ROBINSON and Mrs. EvA.Ns-then Eiss CARIINGTON-at Cheltenham prior to her marriage as weU as of what occurred after the ceremony had been performed. Had RoBINxSOx a latch-key of the houz3 in which MIrs. EVANS was lodging in the Edgware-road ? Did the persons who were set to wa'Lh by the detective officer testify truly or falsely in the accounts they gave of what they had seen ? No one, we presume, requires further information upon points of this description-or, if any such there be, he must refer to the report of the trial. WVhat we wotld remark upon is the substautial anomaly -so discordant with our usual practice in such matters-of calling upon a! man to criminate himrelf, or, still worse, his partner in adultery, and then of assigning perjury against him if he have borne testimony contrary to the facts. No doubt in the Ecclesiastical Court the suit was nominally between the injured husband on the one part and the alleged adulteress on the other; but substantially we assert that the paramour was as much before the Court as the nominal parties to the proceeding. He was in effect a principal, although in name a witness. Of coiurse, the matter did not end there. Under the old system, from the first issue of the writ in the case of c1iim. con. to the sanclion by the CROWN of the Divorce Bill it was all one suit. Now the husband, now the adulteress, now the paramoar stepped ouit into the glare of publicity, buit the proceeding was one and entire. It may be said in this case that the defendanl was not compelled to answer in the Ecslesia.tical Court as he did. No doubt an answer cannot be dragged out of a witness when his answer would have the effect of exposing him to a crimina. cherge, either iu the common law or ecclesiastical courts. It must be remembered, however, that ROBINSON did not deny this clbarge upon oath until, after the second trial, it was intimated by the CHIFi BARON that an innocent man ought to and would deny his guilt upon bis oath. On this provocation he acted. If legal compulsion was not on him, moral compulsion was i and so to screen, let us hope, fir6t the wMoman, and I then him-elf, he went dowrn to Doctors' commons and. swore as the (Q=F BARox required. We would call particular attention to the manner in which the late Lord DL,tC,- expressed himself upon this subject on the QuEPN's trial. " We have been told," said that eloquent advocate, " that BERGAMlI might be " produced as a witness in our exculpation, but ' we know this to be a fiction of lawyers which " common sense and natural feeling would reject. " The very call is one of the unparaUeled circum"stances of this extraordinary case. From thle " begin.n.in.g of the world ?O intstance is to be "found of a man. accused of adultery beinzg "called as a winess to diqsprove it. . . How "shameful an inquisition would the contrary "practice engender ! Great as is the obligation "to veracity, the circumstances might raise a "doubt in the most conscientious mind whether "it ought to prevail. MIere casuists might dis"pute with plausible arguments on either side, but "the natural feelings of mankind will be likely to triumph over their moral doctrines. Supposing "the existence of guilt, perjury itself would be "thought venial in comparison with the ex"posure of the confiding woman. It follows that "no such quesuion ought in any case to be ad- ministered, nor such temptatiok given to tamper with, the sanctity of oaths." Even so, however, -when we have thus pointed out the anomaly of admittiu-g ROBINSON to bear testimony at all upon the subject of Mrs. Evs's guilt-he, as alleged, being the paramour, and she the adulteress, and of punishing bim if he perjured himself-we have not dore. What shall we say when we find the przsumed adultcress herself in the witnc.,s-box and called upon to testify to the quest:on of her own guilt or innocence? We eannot remember anything of late years ill the administratlon of justiee which has so roughly Shocked our feelings of propriety and our sense of justice and sound policy as the production of this woman in the witness-box In the course of the recent proceedings. To expect a true answer from her lips was a farce. She was bound by every consideration which can affect the human mind to make one particular statement, and no other. Was she guilty, her testimony went for notbng-was she innocent, for nothing too. No purpose could be answered by placing her in the witness-box, but the satisfaction of an idle bravado, or the gratification of a prurient curiosity to see the woman who had b-en the actress in the scenes under discussion. What! expect a woman publicly to declare " I have "violated every duty to GoD ard man. In the "broad light of day, in public places, as well as "in my own private apartments,-at home and 'abroad,-in vehicles where I was r'-arce shrouded "from the driver's gaze, I have covered myself "with infamy, and here I stand ta proclaim the " fact." Is this possible? Is it a spectacle of which one can think without shame and disgust ? We can but wonder that any gentleman was founcd who would consent to be an actor in such a scene, and who could dare to put the questions necessary to the elucidation of such facts. One would think that a mauns tongue would refuse its office when called upon for such service as this. Thie result, of course, was that 1Yrs. Ev&ss cleared Rownrsox upon her oath, and ROBy?soN upon his oath cleared Mrs. EvAis, and the effect of the two oaths combined could not weigh with a feather's weignt in the decision of the case. tInder the new system we veryearnestly trust that such a proceeding as this may never occur. There ought to be no indietments for perjury against the principal actors in such scene3; indeed, if indikGments there are to be at all, the common feeling of mankind would almost say, let each be indicted for spealdkng the truth, if truth from one is to criminate the other at all. There should be no law nor any administration of law which sets the ordinary feelings of humanity at defianee. Such machinery must obviously bre^k down; it is as foolish in design as it is barren of result.

A MEsSAGE oN OYsTxEs.-Governor Wise has sent another message to the Legislature of Virginia on the subject of oysters; in fact, the Goverror appears to be in a aonstant oyster stew; and when we consider the marvellous productiveness of the sea coast of the old dominion in the Luxurious article of bivalvcs his anxiety to make the oystor beds of his native State yield a revenue to the Governnteut is not snrpriing. Although his proposition to levy a tax on oysters is for the sole benefit of Virginia, yet hls recom. mendations that restrictive laws should be enacted to prevent the utter desti nction of this favourite shell-fish are of interest to the whole oyster-eating community. Oysters are one of the chief solaces of social existence in this country, and whatever tends to their preservation concerns net VFrginia alone, but the entire Union. According to the estimate of Governor Wise Virginia possesses an area of about 1,680.000 acres of oyster beds, containing aboeut 784,C0,003 of bushels of o3sters. It is estimnated that the mother oyster spawns annnually at least 3,000,000; yet, notwithstanding this enormons productive power, and the vast extent of oyster beds, there is danger of the oyster being exterminated unless measures are adopted to prevent fishermen from taking thein at Improper seasons of the year. Governor Wiise proposes to confine the oystercatching besiniess to citizeng of the State exclusively, and to charge tbree cents, a bushel for all the oysters taken which he estibnta3et w;uld yield a revenue of $480100. annually; he would have a flotilla of four steamboass employed to protect the o)ster beds from piratical intruders or he would fartm nut the oyster beds to PrivAte contractors to do with tbem as they please. The Governor thinks tbe oyster banks will pay a batter bonus to the State than paper money banks, ard regards theni as a richer source of profiS than any gold, coal, iron, or copper mines. Whether the Virginians levy a tax on oysters or nkot, we trnst that they will not neglect the admonition of Governor Wise to deviso soue effective sacasurse for the preservation of those prime¢ aCoesaaries or life. Tho idea of a world wvithout oysters is al togeth er too S l'oonly for conteinplation.-NGD York Ttshic4,

"All was quiet in the Punjab. The Gogaria rising has been entirely put down. Neemuch has been besieged by the Mundisore insurgents for nearly a fortnight. On the 21 st of November an attempt was made to take the fort by escalade, but the enemy were repulaed with great loss, and the siege was raised on the 22d. " The Mhow column, under Brigadier Steuart, was attacked near Mundisore by the insurgents on the 2ist of November. Theinsurgentswere repulsed. On the 23d the column advanced tothe north of MIundisore, on the Neemuch road, and found the rebels in a strong position, with five guns. The position was immediately attacked, and the rebels defeated with the loss of all their guns. While this battle was in progress the Mundisore garrison came out and attacked our rear, but they got well beaten also. The rebels in the fights of the 21st and 23d lost 1,500 men, while our loss was inconsiderable. Lieutenant Gedmayne, of Her Majesty's 24th Dragoons (1), was kiUed, and Major Robinson, 25th Native Infantry, wounded.

MONEY-MAREETand CITY INTBLLIGBNCB. Thursday EvenIg. The Bank of England have reduced their rate of ~discount from 10 per cent., at which it was fixed -'on the 9th of November last, to 8 per cent. The reduction will also apply to advances on Govern;ment seourities, &e., till the dividends. Of course, simultaneously with this movement, repayment has been made of the 2,000,0001. of over issue sanctioned by the Bank Indemnity Bill. The gcirculation, therefore, now resumes its former condition, and the amoun' of Bank of England notes ln excess of 14,475,0001. will be regulated entirely -by the efflux or influx of bullion. The present measuire was generally looked for by -the public, and it will doubtless be fully justified by the Ga-ette return to be published to-morrow evening. Since the preceding return the arrivals of gold kave been continuous, and there is little prospect of -their immediate cessation. In the panic of 1847 the maximum rate of 8 per cent. was maintained only for four weeks. On this occasion 30 per cent. has been continued for nearly seven ,weeks. The English funds opened this morning at an improvement of an eighth, and subsequently exhibited firmness. Consols for January were first quoted 9)31 to } ex dividend, and occasionally during the day there were buyers at 93J. At the close 93N was the exact price. The reduction of the Bank rate of discount was apparently not resolved upon until after much discussion, the announcement being made at about half-past 2 in the afternoon. Owing to the extent to which it had been anticipated, the measure prodnced little effect on the market. Bank Stock left off at 217 to 218i; Reduced, 931 to ; New Three per Cents., 931 to J; India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount; aud Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount -to Is. premium. In the Stock-Exchange money Is in full supply on Government securities at from 4 to 5 per cent. At the Bank of England, after the reduction of the rate, there was an active demand. In the discount-market choice bills are negotiated at 71. The discount housos have reduced their rates of allowance to 6G per cent. for money at call and 6G with seven days' notice. The joint-stock banks resolved a day or two back to fLx 0 per cent. as itheir rate for all new deposits, and they have therelore not made any further alteration. An average business has been transacted in Tforeign stocks generally at former prices; Turkish, however, closed at an advance of i per cent. 13razilian Five per Cents. were negotiate.. at 98 and !97 ; Buenos Ayres, 96; Mexican, 19k; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 76 and 75; for the account, 77; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 07S ; Spanish, 42; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 26; Turkish Six per Cents., 95O; for the account, 95:f, 4,, i, and ; ditto Four per Cents. G uaranteed, 2.01; Venezuelan Four-and-ThreeQuiarters per Cents., 30 and 31; and Belgian Your-and-a-Half per Centa., 90. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were G7f. 55c. for money and 67f. 5,c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eigghth. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates -upon Hamburg and Paris were rather lower, but Amsterdam was about the same aa last post. She business actually transacted was unimporLant. About 80,0001. in gold was taken to the Bank to-day. The quotation of exchange from Bombay shows a favourable movement of a-half per cent. The Board of Trade returns may henceforth be expected, until a new reign of dishonest speculation shall lhave been established, to present totals which vill represent the natural trade of the country. We must, therefore, for some time bid fareweU to the grand figures with which we have so long been deluding ourselves. The statement for Novemiber has just been issued, and under the circumstances gives exactly the results that might have been looked for. Compared with the correspond'ing month of lst year, the declared value of our exportations, notwithstanding the pressure for money, which mu5t have caused shipments to be made to every quarter where the slightest chance of an immediate market still remained, shows a falling off of 1,986,2601. This diminution has affected every branch of business, but the most prominent instances are in cotton, linen, silk, and wooUen mautifactures. MIetals have been influenced, but to a less extent. With regard to the colonial trade, haberdashery, hardwares, and leather furnish the best tests, and in the two first there has been a great decline. Annexed is a table showing the exact increase ox decrease under each head DECLxZnD VALUx Or ExrOIrTAtomlOxs The total of our exports for the tirnt 11 months of the year has been 115,007,1961., showing an increase of 9,161,5651., or aboat 8 per cent. The -changes have occurred in the following order:- lrcre,az. Decrease. .Tanuary ... ... ... February... ... ... March ... ... ... 1:007 77S April ... ... ... A(,lS MIay . . ... ... 2,648,'¶Jt4 JU.rie ... ... . .. -- ..... 30,247 July ... ... ... August ... ... ... S8V113 Septemlber .. ... 852.21.3 Ojtu'otr ..... ... ... 38"J8S..i LNovetaber ... ... - 1,93S.260 Compared with the correspondi:2g 1L months of 165-5 the increase is 28,159,9!ij., or rasher more thjan i32 per cent. WVith regard to imported conimodities there has been a proportionate falling off in the general conzaumption. Grain and flour have arrived in full nuantities, and in most other cases the arrivals have heen considerable, but the supplies taken into use show a great diminution. This is espeeially observable in wines, spirits, cocoa, and spices. The totals of sugar, coffee, tea, fruit, anid tobbaco, all show likewise a reduced consumption. In the couirse of the present month this contraction must have made further progress, and1 for some tims forward its effects vwill be viible in the Cistoms and Excise receipts. Subjoined are the quantities of provAionA mTe following are the comparative imports and exports of raw material, showing a large increase in the importation of every article except hemp. With diminished consumption, our stocks, therefore, must have considerably increased, and the prospects of the foreign exchanges are to that extent imnroved:- Another satisfactory resumption has been announced of a house in the American trade. The suspension of Messrs. T. B. Coddington and Co., iron-merchants, of Liverpool, was mentioned last month, but It has proved to be but temporary, the firm having only waited until they could hear from their New York house. This house, on being advised of the suspension of their Liverpool establishment, on account of liabilities on accoptances of other parties who had failed, did not suspend payment, but by return steamer enabled the firm on this side to make a satisfactory arrangement, which has just been effected -with the holders of the acceptances on which they are liable and with all their other creditors, by which they pay them In full with interest, and resume their business. Letters from the provinces to-day report the su'spension of Mr. W. C. Haigh, of Bradford, largely engaged in the woollen trade, Messrs. Hands Marcher and Co., Dutch merchants at Hull, and Messrs. Stevenson,Vermehren, and Scott, merchants at Newcastle. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. C. Nicholson and Co., warehousemen, trading at 61 and 62, St. Paul'schurchyard, and 39 and 40, Cannon-atreet west, whose suspension was announced yesterday, was held this morning. In the balance-sheets submitted by Mr. Parrinton the liabilities for the two houses are stated to be about 66,0001., while the joint assets, taking the stock at cost price, would show about 19s. in the pound. A lengthy discussion took place upon a proposal of a composition of 12s. 6d., payable in four instalments, extending over a period of four months, and with security for the last payment. It was finally resolved to accept the offer, but it is feared from the complicated nature of the accounts that an appeal to the Bankruptcy Court is inevitable. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. S. C. Lister and Co. took place yesterday at Haliifax, when a statement was submitted, showlng the liabilities to araount to 253,1901., while the assets are estimated at 210,8891., bosides Mr. Lister's private estate, valued at upwards of 250,0001. A proposition for the payment of 20s. in the pound in instalments, extending over a period of two years, was accepted unanimously. The following, from an experienced manufacturer, gives a further illustration of the system, as recently revealed in one of the Scotch Sequestration Courts, under which an export trade at the rate of half a mMillon a-year can be carried on at a continuou.s loss to the country by persons nearly destitute of capital, or who may even be in embarrassment a, the very commencement of their career:- "Sir,-Your exposure of the pernicious system and baneful results of trading on blank credits meets with the entire approval of all the honest mercantile community. The case of Messr MoKenzle, Ramsay, and Co., noiw pending In the Dundee Sequestration Court, affords another lamentable instance of the evils inseparable from a system of trade based on accommodation paper. " It appears that this fLrm commenoed business in 1849 as commission merchants. with acanital nf 71UW -nA -- U a- since transpired, at a time when Mr. MoKeozie was 2,7001. behind the world, so that the capital of the firm was really that sum less than its stated amount, in 1850 they began to manufacture goods for the American market, and during their brief career they thought proper to advance 2,5001 to a frm they started in business as power-loom factors; they sank a further sum of 4,0001. in a bleaohfield ; they had transactions in one year with a bank amounting to the sum of 417,8491., and they pay in a similar period for dis. counts 10,0001. "One naturally is led to Inquire how so smaU a capital In a manufaoturing business could command such compsratively large transactions. Mr. MIcKenzle in his examination enlighteus the unin. itiated, and communicates the mode in which his firm conducted their bsiness. The yarns were ordered of a spinner on a credit of four or five months, and sent to a yarn bleacher, who accepts a bUIl for their value, and holds the yarns as security. These yarns, when bleached, are sent to the factory, and the ostensible proprietor accepts another bill, the proceeds of which are applied to pay for the wearing; the manufactured article is now sent to a cloth bleacber or to a calenderer, either of whom accepts another biLl and holds a lien over the goods. These bill laden goods when finished must be replaced by others to secure the acceptors of the bills against loss, and are then consigned to a New York comuission house andanotherbill drawn on the home house of the Armerican firm for a sum within the cost to seciure them against loss from depreciatlon. " The first shipmnents of goods on consignment to the Anerican market 6enerally realize fair remunerative prices; but it wiU happen that the goods in a market eo notoriously fluctuating and uncertain as that of the United States are i.ot sold with that punctuality with which bills become due, and when such occurrences do take place, and the consignor is unable to supply funds to take up the bill, the goods are sold to meet it at what they wiUl bring, and the unfortunate consignor sustains the loss. "The bistory of Messrs. McKRenzie, Ramsay, and Co. is identical with that of all needy houses that consign goods to the United States market-certain ruin to themselves, much loss to their creditors, great injury to those engaged in the sAmne trade, and benefiG only to the commission houses. "The Americans remark that for one such house ruined by consignments to their market there are three other fools reaay to take its place. With whom, then, rests the power to stay or lessen the evil that acts so lnjuriously to the prudent honest trader? If credit were not given so readily, if facilities for raising money were curtailed, and a law passed to punish crininally all who engage in accominodation bill transactions, much loss would be prevented. Another evil arises from creditors, dreading the expenses of the Bankruptoy Court, glossing over the oircumstances of the dishonest trading of the insolvent to secure the best possible dividends. It surely would be more dignified and in the end more profitable to refuse acceptance of any dividend Cave through tlhe Bankruptcy Court in aU cases where tradirg has been carried on with the aid of blank credits, or peraisted In after the capital of the insolvent had been lost. "I am, S3ir, your obedient Servant, " MANUFACFURER" It is understood that it is the intention of the directors of the Union Bank of Australia at the next meeting of proprietors to cell up the proportion of the bank's capital unpaid on the third issue of shares.

TEE LATB GENERAL BARNARD. -0 We are reques ed by a near connexion of General Barnard to publish the following memoir of his serices - "At a time when honour and rewards have been so liberally conferred on the aotors in the great scene of tho capture of Delhi It is but fair to give the tribute of a plain but honourable statement of facts to one whose services have been nearly entirely suppreased, except for one or two friendly as well as just voices raised in the House of Commons in honour of the zealous devotion to his profession and his country's service, combined with high talents, which were displayed in a command of six most lmportant weeks duration by the late Major-General Sir Henry Baraard. "This officer arrived at Umnballa to command at the station towards the end of April, 1857, when symptoms of disaffection were already frequent among the native troop: there. Upon the 10th of May the fmst outbreak took place at that quarter, which wastemporarily repressedby the exertions of the General and his staff, and upon the 11th intelligence arrived there of tho revolt and insurrection at Meerat and Delhu General Barnard instantly despatched his aido-de. camp to Simla to Inform General Anson, the Commander, in.Chief in India, of these events, and request h's immediate presence. "In the interim Sir HE Barnard found himself with the ardaous task on his hands of preparing a force which might be in forwardnews to take the field so soon as General Anson sh, . arrive at Umballa to assame the command. The nmagazines at the station were empty of stores and ammunition; even the reserve artiUery waggons were in depo5t at PhiUour. There were no European regimenrs of infantry at hand, and the Bengal troops of that arm were utterly disaffected. Added to this the medical and commissariat officers declared it Impossible to move at that season of the year-the first, from the danger to the health of the troops, a-d the want of conveyance for wounded and sck ; the second from the total want of everything necessary to supply a moveable column in the field. "N'otwithstanding these very heavy difficalties, by exertions which few men are capable of, Sir H. Barnard assembled troops, artillery, and the means of transport, making the necessary arrangements also for the force being foUowed by a siege train. Upon the 14th of May G3neral Anson arrived at UImballa from Simla, and upoa the 21st of May the first division of a small but well-composed force marched from Uinballa on the ronte to Delhi. General Amnso left Umballa on the 25th of May, on the 26th he was seized by fatal ilness at Kurnaul, and Sir W. Barnard, summoned from a slok bed by telegraph, arrived oDly in time to hear the last words and wishes of the Commanderin-Chief, aud to receive from him the guidance of the Delhi force. "Guns of a heavier calibre than those belonging to the artilery at UmbaUsa (6-pounders) being considered indispensably necessary were on their way to the army from PhilUour, and it was considered advisable to wait their arrival at KurnauL On the 31st a 9-pounder batt3ry was escorted into the camp, and the same evening the march was continued from Kurnaul towards Paneepat. "At Raee, where General Wilson's force was to have joined thai under Sir Henry Barnard, it was found that the orders of Mr. Greathed, the Assistant-Commissioner of the North-West Provinces, had detained General Wilson in contradiction to a clear and positive order which General Ansoen had forwarded to him to effect a junction at th3t place wlth the Delhi column, As that General was to bring with him the greater part of the artillery and guuners, as well as all the sappers which were to be employed 1n the I attaok of the city, an advance without this junction was impossible. General Barnard, however, having despatched elephants to bring on the troops from Meerut by rapid marches, moved on himself as far as Aleepore; arriving there on the 5th of June he was detained until the 6'h before General Wilson arrived. On the 7th the united force was reorganized for the field, and by the 8th lt became possible to march against Delhi. "U Upon the 8th, then, General Barnard led his force from Aleepore against the enemy. IHe found them intrenched across the main road, in a formidable position at BadeleekeSerage, defended by a heavy battery which swept the line of advance of the troops. By a well-planned flank march of the cavalry and a brilliant advance against the battery by the 75th Regiment, the action, whioh lasted about an hour, wvs decided in favour of the British, and the enemy fled in dieorder from the field. Upon the same morning, upon his own judgment, and contrary to the opinion of General Wilson and of his own staff, he again advanced, and by a bold aud skilful movement of one column under hLs own guidance, he gained the heights of the cantonment above Delhi, defeating the rebels, capture ing their guns, and d&Ivlng them in disorder within the wails. IFrom this first successful day up to the close of his life General Barnard's energy and activity were most conapiouous. In 17 days the force under his command fought nine successful actions, and some of them of a very obstinate character. The General himself was, as described in a letter written by Colonel Chamberlaiu about that tlme, ' always in the saddle,' exposed to; the heat of the san at all times, and never sparing, when the service of the country required him, that life and health so valuable to his family and his numerous friends. " Atlengtb nature seems to havefalled under such unsparing calls upon her resources. The 4th of July had been an unusually trying day. The Bareilly brigade arrived tha prevlous evening at Delhi, and attemptod by a concaaled march to gain our rear, cut off our convoys, and deskroy the stores of the army at Aleepore. From the very earliest hour Sir H. Barnard haa been on horseback, present every. where, and undergoing every hadship of fatigue and exposu StiU his unflinching courage and endurance, his high and enthusitc sense of duty, sustined him, and on that very evening he dined at table with his staff, conversed with hisusual cheerfulness, and no one perceived how fataly bis existence was already undermined. " At 7 am. on the 5th of July Sir H. Barnard sent for Colonel Baird Smith, the Commanding Engineer, and in a private conference with him explained and justified all that he thought might hereafter be called in question. When Colonel Baird Smith quitted him, at 9 o'clock, he sent for medical advice; and when it arrived his illness was soon pronounced to be mortaL He died about 3 p.m. the same day. " Sir H. Barnnrd was a man of extraordinary activity, endurance, and hardihood. Those who saw him when on service and observed his habits in the Crimea mus, bear testimony to these characteristics. The correspondent of a London journal in writing of his death says:-' The sudden death of Sir Henry Barnard was the more melancholy because it was thoroughly unexpected, his surprising activity and vigour of frame having kept him up surprisingly until the sudden attack of cholera carried him off. Sir Henry is admitted on all hands to have had many of the first qualities for command, his energy and spirit being as remarkable as his great hardiness and cheorful demeanour.'-Dai'Py News. " In conclusion, Sir H. Barnard was thus carried off, after, it is true, a command of only six weeks, but it was during that time the only British war force in Bengal or even in India that he had under his command; and having overcome namberless difficulties in the collecting, organiL.ng, transporting, aud provisioning It, he led It with brilliant success in every encounter to that point before Delhi from which the army eventuaUy effected the capture of the city. His name Is little mentioned amid the applause which greets the exploits of his successor, butto an impartial eye his labours, though less brilliant, were not muchil nferlor in merit. General Wilson's merit is conspicuous, and the praise and rewards which acknovrledge it most worthily bestowed. lnt it may throw some doubt upon the d'scerniment and impartiality of the public when It is seen that it receives without examination the appreciation dictated to it by public writers of the labours of military men. With both tue public and the press success Is the criterion of merit, and dazzled by the applause attendirg on great exploits tley forget the often more arduous labours which hlve prepared the last and brilliant triumph which 'hey celebrate. - it in the hope that it may be possible to rescue from thts injuistice the memory and military reputation of an officer whose labours fell short but little of any which the North-vestProvinces have witnessed tbas thts shortv memoir has beeu prepatedi; and it will be admitted by many a military okserver that there is no exaggeration ia the mssertiot, that if General Wilson gloriously completed the on 'qu-ss of Doihi General Ba'nard formed and organized the force whioh first approached the ilty; that he comriranded with skilU and success that first nucleus of a more powerful army; and that by the wholesomie fear vhich his numerous socce-ses inspired in the enemv he ably prepared the way for that great exploit which General Wilson both ekilfilly and fortunately achieved.

Twmrn.?v Mnp,rnrn JulUrin any years no intelligence has created in Dublin so profound a sense of relief and lgratification as the happy deliverance by Sir Colin Campbell of the garrison of Lucknow. The news reached here about 2 o'clook p.m., and up to the last hour of the day continued to be the all-engrossing topic of ptublic interest and congratulation. It was felt, however, that there must be inevitably a gloomy side of the picture, for which all must be prepared when the faU details come to hand. Six days' sangainary fighting cannot but have left desolate many a homtstead in the three kingdoms. THE LATE JUDGE JAsON. The Cork7 Reporter revives this anecdote in connexion with the Parliamentary career of the late judge, who during his long life was an enthusiastic supporter of the exploded Kildare-place system of national education. Mr. Jackson filled the post of hon. secretary to the society:- "'`hile the late judge was Solicitor-General, Lord Stanley, too, held office under Sir Robert Peel, and m.intained the National System of education, of which he boasted himself to have been the officlal fornder. One of the annual votes of censure on the system baving been brought forward by the Solicitor-General's colleague in the representation of the University, Mr. Hamilton, the Solicitor-General, felt himself somewhat embarrassed between officil and Kildare-street Influence, and, deeming discretion the better part of valour, was observed to walk out of the House. Our then representative, Serjeant Murphy, was in possession at the time, and called the attention of Lord S- to the movement, observing that he apprehended that the learned Solicitor-General for Ireland bad studied with equal attention the books of Exodus and Judges." THE POPE. The hon. member for Dungarvon having from time to time succeeded in obtaining letters laudatory of his recent work, Ro7ne, its Rlders, &c., from such notables as Cardinal Wiseman, Dr. Cullen, and the like, has just received his crowning bays from the hand of His Holiness the Pope, who thus writes to MIr. John Francis Maguire:- "VWell-beloved Son; Health and Apostoltcal Benedictlon,-We have lately received your most dutifal letter, dated the 17th day of November last, in which you have been pleased to present to us a work composed by you in tbo English language, and published this year in London, with the title, Rorn-,4 its Bulers and te Institutions. Of this work we have been unable to enjoy the perusal, owing to our extremely imperfect acquaintance with the language i which it is written; yet, from the statement of persons of the highest character for competency and trustworthiness -who have perused the same work we learn with peculiar satisfaction that it contains many evidences of your singular devotedness, attachment, and reverence to us, and towards the Holy See-a circumstance which could not faU to prove most gratifying to our feelings. Therefore, while bestowing our heartfelt commiendation on this noble expression of your sentiments towards us, we return you thanks for the Aift; and as a testimony of our fatherly love towards you we impart to you affectionately from our heart the apostolic benediction.

THB SMOICE NUISANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF TErE TIMES. Sir,-The smoke nuisance, on a moderate c%loulation I costs the natives of London about 2,000,0CG0. sterling a-year, but I fear the remedy is not so slmple as " B' imagines. I have tried the plan he proposes of lighting the fire from the top instead of as usual '.rom the hettom having also fitted in an iron plate to prevent upward draught, and I find the rexult to ba a slow dull burning fire, having this advantage, that being dul and slow it is therefore cheap, and, further, wvil burn for 10 hours without mending, and would thus suit those who require but a samall fire and have not the opportaunity of attending th it. As to its beingsmokeless, thisis a mistake; to me it appears to smnoke just in proportion to its dulness. Were it more sctive teriez would at first be mnre smoke, and when fnlly incaudeseant almost no smoke. My fire, on " B 'a" proposed model, lved a melaneholy life, smoking as niuch as its strergth would permit, aud finally expired, still surrounded by v.sible fumes. Bven Dr. Arnott's Orate makes no smaU amonut of smoke, as any one can satisfy himself by observmng hlow quickly sc*tooUelts on the hack o2 the firepltees con. tect3d with Arnotun Am t_s. In short, vhen any fuel is made to smoulder dovxnm i instead of burning upwards, you nust have slowxcomburAion, and, aa.a consequence, a dull fite, and th, is, w-hst Johun BU1U0 zil at h-rnr -;'- 4ao1oc1d 'a cit E.. mkl)? ,

The reinforcements for the 18th Royal Irish, 51st Ltght Infantry, 72d Lighlanders, 83d, 86th, and 98th Regiments, upwards of 200 men of all ranks, will leavo Chatham garrison to-morrow, and embark at Gravesend on board the S slamanca for India. Yesterday the troops belonging to the 2d Battalion at Chatbam were assembled on the general parade-ground a' Chatham Barraoks for the purpoie of hearing read the proceedings of a district court-martial for the trial of Sergeant Foord, of the 90th Light Infantry, on a charge of drunkenness. The sentence of the Court was read by Captain Roney, the adjutant of the battalion, the prisoner being reduced to the rank and pay of a private. Immediately after the sentence had been read the seuior sergeant-major was directed to cut the " stripes" off the prisoner's arm in the presence of the wvhole battalion. The prisoner has been upwards of 20 years in the service, and had claimed his dis. charge previous to the committal of .the offence for which he was tried. # The steamship Australasia, Captain Sreales, from Ports. mouth, with the head.quarters of the 68th Regiment for India, arrived In Plymouth Sound yesterday morning. Tho following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Lieutenant C. C. Mitchell, to the Blenheim; Lieutenant H. F. Nicholson, to the Excellent; Lieutenant G. Price, to the Excellent, J.

COU2SEL AND FELON8. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You could not well add anything to your article (December 21) on this subjeot, but I wish you would allow counsslI "to consent." I would premise that I only know Mr. Coleridge by name, and have never heard of him otherwisa than favourably. When I read his speech, in which he termed the outrage "unfortunate"-" cruel, if you will," I felt that, if my wig and gown had been by 3ue, I should have trodden them under foot as symbols of a system which requires or permits such things to be said by gentlemen for money because they happen to wear wigs and gowns. Macaulay (himself a barrister), strongly animadverting on what only barristers fail to see, remarks on the strangeness of the theory that a man wearing a wig and gown can say and do what no possible consideration would induce him to say or do if not wigged and gowned. I know the shple arguments in answer to this. I am sick of them and ashamed of them. I remember what they were in the little matter of a poor girl being driven mad by an insinuation of her being a murderess, spontaneously and deliberately mado " in the discharge of his duty," when the counsel knew of his client's confession. I know what an ex-ChanceUor said in assortion of the license of an advo. cate; I am sorry for It. I grant that the practice has not, In general, the moral effect on the advocate as a man which might be expected, and I do believe that barri3ters are, in general, as honourable and high-principled as any other class; but the stiU prevailing theory as to their rights and duties Is, I think, absolutely monstrous in its absurdity, and the practice an intolerable abuse and nui sance. Our techniqute has been partly reformed; It is time that our meor-al should be. Not very long ago you had to animadvert on a case where a counsel (with whom also I am, and always shaU be, personally quite unacquainted) actually took upon himself (" in the exercise of his discretion," &c.) to invent and suggest in public tbe idea, that a lady on whose premlses a robcery had been committed had an intrigue with, I think, the thief, his client. (I mean the prisoner.) Even this was, of course, justilfied; and I have no doubt that many Old Balleyites (not in the dock) really could no more understand Its being wrong, or, if wrong, "incorrect," than a whipper-in would its being wrong to crack a horsewhip. Now and then, especiaUy, perhaps, of late, some pretty sbarp remarks on the license of counsel drop from the bench, and sometimes, though by no means so often as might be expected, from the press; and I have hopes that a trner theoryand a purer practice than the present will some time be well established. There was much excellent sense and right feeling in what the Examinser urged In dealing with one of the eases to which I have alluded; and it scarcely went too far in saying that, if the usual pleas for the prevailing system be admitted, the profession of the law must be styled the profession of the lie. I apprehend that the true crlterion of what may or may not be said by a hired talker for his paymaster lies in the question whether usage or guineas, or wig and gown, or name of advocate, or the like can justify direct or indirect falsehood. Is quid terum atque decens a wrong or an unfair rule? The theory is that the advocate is his client's mouthpiece, and is to say what his client would or might, &c. Be It so; much must be matter of taste, judgment, &c.; but if the client would, might, &e., utter or act lies, sianders, insults, false accusations of crime, &c., let him do such work himself, or dispense with it; and let It not be pretended that a gentleman, whether dressed as a scarecrow or not, can legitimately be hired, under any name or form whatever, to lie or assassinate, or even to weep (it can be done in superior style for a wife-poisoner, and would be for Nana Sahib) for villains whom it wouid be our " pride " to supply with proper " ornaments," aud for whom we would gladly retain the best services of Mr. Caleraft at our own expense. People are so accuLstomed to counsel's ways that they generally only regard them as such-as something curious and venial, partly meaningless and partly contemptible. Many counsel feel, I believe, about as you do upon the sabject; many regisrd anything said to the same effect by any of their professional brethren (even when writers of eminence farhigher than any mere professional eminence can be) as inspired by personal feeling or the bitterness of brief. lessness. It happens that neither influence exists in the case of your correspondeat. I admit, however, that as a barrister, and therefore a person expected to misrepresent facts toa jury and mis-state law to a judge stany rascal's bidding for 21 pieces of silver. I amm bnt ILL BIRD.

A SLAVEONYNE1'3 BMItLE.-MOSt of our readers bave probably seen the print from Scbeffer's picture of " ChriAt the Consoler;" but some have not, and for thorn we will just explain that in this most affecting picture Christ is enthroned in the centre, and that He on the one hbnd "'heals the broken-hearted," and on the other affords " deliveranoe to the captives." The group of mourners consists of the mother weepin over her dead infant ; the woes of cenius personified inlasso, the Christian epic poet; a group of tbree women, the aged widow, the young widow (her child unborn), and the young girl, manifesting the three phases of trast-faith, resignation, and hope; wbile the group of nien behind them yield the conversa moods-un. belief, rebellion, and despair, in thcharacters of the infidel, the iecusant, and the intending suicide. These are the mourners. On the other hand of the Deliverer are the captives. Mary released from sin by tears, "because she loved much;" the maniac, whose chains drop as sanity awakens in his countenance; the serfs of varions nations, whether miUitary or industrial, and in the midst, with ohpined hands outstrtcthed, the negro slave. In the corner are the beautiful accessories of the broken sword and the spent cannon-ball. Such is Scheffor's picture. A very beautiful new edition of the Prayer-book of the Church of England, and Bible to corres-lond, is now on sale In the southern States of the Union. the edition being difficult to obtain, except by southern purchasers, though publisbed by T. P. Lippencott and Co., Philadelphia. The Prayer-book exhibits at the back of its titlepage the authorization of the well known BL-bop Doane, bishop of New Jersey, as to the precise accordanceof this addition wvith thestandard Book of Common P'rayer. Teb date of this volume is 1856, whereas that of the companion Bible is IS54. Both have a frontisniece, and t,e frontpiece sthe samein both-viz., the "Christ the Consoler" of Scheffer, with the nesro left out.

I THE LATE FATAL ACC/ZDRYT FEAR HOWDEN.I, The jury appointed to inq=e into the origin of the acol. dent which occurred at the Ondee Vitriol Works at filowdendike on the 12th inst., when seven personi lest their lives wad several nthers were injured, by the fall of a chimtney upwards of 120 feet high, have meb on four octaeione. Onlr thereporteroftheRatcrn Countive Herald wan gduiited to the inquest.room by the coroner, Mr. R. B. Porter, thar functionary stating that, In his opinion one representative of fhe presa was quite sufficient on such occasions to give the public an oCCQunt of the proceedIngs. From the report of the inquest thus furnished we subjolu the most material ev dence: Edward Marriot examined.-I live at Howden-dike, andt am workiug chymist and manager as Mr. Anderton's vitriol works; first entered his employment in Jaly last. Wasalso enmployed to superintend the workmen engaged at the chimney and the works connected therewith. Farnished plans and speeifications for all the works except the chimney; with it f had nothing to do, except to see that the men did their duty. These works were zhe first I had put up. The chambber and burning-house were as aitrongly built as any in EnglaDd. There are only two others equally strong. I have been brought up a manufacturing chymist, and ain therefore acquainted with such works. All vitriol chambers are constructed on the same principle, but ours was stronger. The sides of the chamber I considered sufficiently stroDg without diagonal bracing. I know of a larger chamber constracted ia the saute way, and of only tbesamesized planks. The erectionof thebchiuneycormmenced in August. The foundations etood upon war? ia the first instauce, then concrete formed of gravel, Iome, and sand, the quality of which I do not undarstand. I had the overlooking of the workmen employed at the chimney from the commencement. The height of it was a little more than 42 yards. Had never in the course of its erection cause to find fault with the manner in which the work was done. X'When it was about 16ft. from completon I observed that it had fallen from its perpendicular. The erection was nevertheless continued. Saw no further alteration in the perpendicular until it vwas finished, when in about a week after I observed a further change. It was then about 14 inches from the perpendicular. Ar that time Mr. Wilde was employed in Putting up a lightning conductor, whtch was fixed avainst the ohi-mn r menirone(L tne slanting of the chimney to Mr. Wilde',s man, whose narme was " Sam," and he said they were in the habit of straightening chimneys. I reported the state of the chimney to Mr. Anderton about a month since. The chimney had not at that time fallen more than 14 inches. My orders from Mr. Anderton were to notice the chimney particularly, and it it gave way any more to let him know. Observed the chimney every day on that account. I, inthe course of three or four days, observed a further deviation of four inches. Reported the matter to Mr. Barker, bookkeeper, who informed kir. .Anderton of it. About a fortnight after that Mr. Wilde came down to straighten it. During this fortnight thechimney had not gone any further. This was about the Ist of December. M1r. Wilde's man commenced operations by taking out a course of bricks from the chimney about 10 feet from the ground on the river side. The chimney leaned from the river. He took the bricks out one by one, in regular succession, replacing each as he took it out by a thinner one and an iron wedge. This oneration extended nearly three-quarters round. Saw Mr. Wilde at the works the firat week his man Sam came. He took my lamp from me one evening to examine the chimnev. After Sam finished the outside he went inside. I did not see what he was doing there till after he had left off working. He was atit till the morning be.ore the accident. He had not then finished. I was passing that morning by the chimney when it leaned over, and I noticed cracks on that side. I called Mr. Barker's attention to it. We examined the chimney together, and then called Sam. He came out. I asked him whether he had noticed those cracks before. He said no, and that he did not think it safe to proceed any further. He then left us, saying he would teleMrapb for his mnster. Sam did not work there afterwards. nlging out of the chimney on the same day; it was on the side of the lightning conductor, oad was three or four feet from the ground. It was on the side of the inxclination I observed it " blistering"- that is, a portion of the bricks peeling off, which extended about three-quarters round in the soltd part of the chimney. The solid part extended about seven feet ulp for about a qu arter of the circumference. That qu'rier lhy towards the burning-house. I was inside on Friday night, the 1Ith,about 9 e'clock. Saw a crack there on the left-hand side of the arch. It was about 12 or 14 incheslong, and a-quarter of an inch wide, running straight up. I nericed the inner rim ant that time, and savw that the same operation had been performed on it as in the outer one, but running all round. I inspected the chimney on the following morning at 7 o'clock, and several times during the forenoon, and saw no difference fromwhat it appeared on the previous evening. Mr. Wilde and his man came over the middle of that forenoon. The man pointed out to him the bulging, and he asked Mr. Wilde the canse of it. Mr. Wilde told Sam that the latter had not relieved the two mid-feathers (connecting waUs running between the outer and the inner rim of the chimney), which rested on the solid part of the chimney. Mr. Wilde then waited for Mr. Andertou,who on the previous day had been sent for to meet Mr. Wilde. He arrived about noon, and I joined them. He asked Mr. Wilde his opinion as to the chimney, and the latter said he need be under no apprehension about its falling. He then told Mr. Wilde that if there was any danger he had better undermine it and throm it into the field. Mr. Anderton added, Can yon do that?T Mr. Wilde said he conld, but, to make perfectly sure, would telegraph for another man. In my presence he repeatedly assured Mr. Anderton of the safety of the chimney. The latter directed Mr. Wild e's attention to the bulging out in the chimney, and asked the reasoa of it. Alr. Wilde answered the mid-feathers were not sufficiently relieved. Mfr. Wilde said he thought after a while the weight of the chimney would come on the river's side, because at that time the wedges on the river side were quite slack. Mr. Wilde promised he would not leave the chimney. I fouand the lightning conductor of the chimney after the accident. It was all curled up together to the length of 15 or 20 yards. The men made not the slightest objection to return to their work after tea on the night of the accident. They stopped to finish because there was only two hours' work to do. I was in the vitriol chamber about four minutes before it fell in. I went straightfrom it to the foot of the chimney,which I examined with my lamp. I observed no change since morning. I was first made aivare tbat the foundation had given way by a bricklayer named Winsley. I told Mr. Wilde of the circumstance the first conversation I had with him, which was after the man had commenced cutting the chimney. My decided opinion is thatthechimney would nothave fallen if it had not been meddled with by MIr. Wilde, His man did nothing more to the chimney after I pointed out the cracksto him - in my opinion the chimney fel! from an overpressure on tne solid part, caused by the non-removal of the two mid-feathers resting on the solid part; I mean the mid-feathers ought to have been relieved. I remember Mr. Wilde giving instruction to his ma,s to relieve the mid-feathers on the side where the bulging out appeared - during some part of the operation the chimney was brought back a foot to the perpendicular. I told Mr. Wilde at that time the chimney was coming over very nicely. I told Mr. Wilde on Saturday night that the chimney would not have fallen it his man had acted in conformity with his inetructions. After I had been in the chimney on Faiday I told Wheldrake, who was with me, that I considered it safe. Before Mr. Wilde's man came there was a slight crack over the man-hole on the outside. I never noticed any difference in the crack till Mr. Wilde had brought over the chimney, and then it began to open. Mr. George Anderton, jun., examined.-I am the owner of the vitriol works. They were commenced in August last. A specification was prepared for me by Mr. Butler, Cleckhexton, land surveyor (tbe specification was put in and read). I advertised for tenders, and received one from bl c-srs. Abraham Roberts and Co., Cleckheaton, offering to build the chimney for 651. 10s. They were men of exDe- rience. We signed a contract. Mr. Roberts cause over. Ilet . the wood-works by tender to Midgley and Ogden, Bradford. Wh'ben Mr. Roberts came over we had some conversation as to the foundations. In the original plan stones were to have been placed above the concrete, bat Roberts advised me Dot to have tbem, as the foundation would be as good without thF n. I asked him if there was a sufficient thickness of concrete, and he replied there wvas. I spoke also to Sinclair, a bricklayer, about it, and his answver was the same. I was then sattsfiad the foundation would be good. Mr. Roberts then stblet the building to Winslades, of Dews. hnry, so that in fact the chinney was erected by the latter. When it was aboit one-fourth of the wvy up I notioed it leaning a little from the perpendicular, and asked the Winsades ifthey had any fear respecting it. They said thty hbd not. 1 then allowed the chimney to go on. It was cot".pIeted about aLx weeks ago. Before its completion I a7ranged vith Mr. Wilde about puttil,g up a lightning con. ductor. His designation is "telegraphic engineer." After the finishing of the chimney I heard from Marriot that the chimney lcaned more out of the Perpendicula, and that Mr. Wilde could straighten it. Afterwards contracted with Mr. Wilde to do so for 151. On Faiday I received a message from Mr. Marriot or Mr. Barker, to the effect that I should go over in the morning, as they were draid the chimney was going to tumble. I- came over, met Mr. Wilde at Howden station, and asked hiM the state of the chimney; he said it was cracked a good deal, bat he v-as perfectly satisfied it was safe. Wilde stated thst he had come to telegraph for ropes and tackles and another mcan to spcure the chimney; we then drove together to the wcrks. (Mr. Anderton next gave evidence respecting the state of the chiminey and his conversation with Mr. Wilde on it, but which did not materially differ from the statement of the witness.) IMr. Barker came up, said he had leen inside the chimney, and did not sea the inside wall to ho any worse, that it " ailed" anything. Mr. Wilde was of the same Opinion. I left orders with him that if there was any danger he should pull the chimney down, and that he wvas iot to leave it on any account. He promised he would not.. Mr. Wilde told me the bulging out was owing to the t-o mid-feathEs3 not being relieved, that the weight of the chimney had been thrown on the outer wall, but that the chimney itself liad gone back somle little, so that the outer wall seas again relieved. William Sinclair, bricklayer at the Khpin works, exmluined.-Mr. Aiidton consulted ino about the foundation of the chimuey, and recomimended concrete. Saw a tracing of the plan, which showed that concrete was to be at the hottom, then two courses of stone, upon which the base of the chimuney was to rest. Recommended all solid concrete instead of skne, to get rid ofthe joining. Not much accustomed to the erection of large chi mneys, but was of windmnill towers, equally heavy, the foundation of which was conerete. A mill I erected for Mlr. Carter had a bate of 22 feet in diaueter. but the foundation of the chiiisney should have been stronger on account of its greater solidity. Would prefer a concrete foundation underall circamstances whatever the nature of tbe soil. Carter's tower has never giv n way; it is about 60 feot high; concrete should not contain stones of greater size than 2 inches cabe. When a chimney is observed giving way when near completion, the pDroper way would be, in mny opinion, to rectify it or take it down. Did not bees- of any of the workmen refuting to go to w ork on the day of the accident. The inquest was again adjourned on Wednesday evening till lionday next. r. Leeuman and 31r. Carter, watched the prooeedings on behalf of Mr. Anderton, jun., proprietor of the works ; Mr. Stead, on behalf of Mr.Wilde,whoundertook therectification v t h chimney; and Mfr.

FOBBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANOE. 1h,o following appeard L our ioond dHition of yes. tardiwv --I (rIOM OUR OWN OORRSONDr,.) FARJl3, WX]DNMAY, DI. 23, 6 P.M. The old rumours of changesin the FrenchCabinet, which had ceased for some time, begin to oirculate at the approach of the New Year. The Home Department, the Finances, Public Instruction, and others were, according to those who ever long fo:' variety, or who merely indulge a taste for idle gosip, to be changed over and over again. The report now current, and which is not rejected in certain political circles, is that the Foreign-office will soon become vacant, and that M. Walewald, the present head of that department, is to be appointed to some high post abroad becoming the position he has long held in the councils of the Emperor and the services he has rendered, and which are bighlyvalued byi]is Majesty. Tshould hardly notice a story which about a year ago was so current, and which I then contradicted, were it not that perwon who do not easily lend an ear to vague rumours think there is reason to believe the present not unfounded In spite of this, I have no hesitation in repeating what Iisaid on former oocasions,-that the Emperor has as little intention of parting with his Mvinister for Foreign Affairs as his Minister has of quitting his post. I am assured, on what I think is good authority, that tne ramour is utterly unfounded. No one can say what timae may bring about, or what caprice, jealousy, or the envy of competitors and rivals may at last effect, but there is reason to believe that the position of Count Walewski never appeared more secure than now, or his Influence with the Emperor more undisputed and complete. The fact seems to be admitted on all hands that the Emperor vilU hardly change a Minister to whom he has been so long habituated, and whose counsl he rarely or never opposes. At the time of the visit of the Emperor to Stuttgart it was rumoured that M. de Morny would accompany him in order to serve as the channel of communication between Russian diplomacy and the French Government. M. de Morny's acquaintance with Russian politics, and the estimation in which he was reported to be held at the Court of St. Petersburg, were alleged by his friends as justifying that step. On the other hand, it was alleged that a person so familiar with the usages of the Russian Court, so favourably viewed by the Czar, and so popular with the Rusian nobility, would necessarlly throw into the shade the Minister for Foreign Affalrs, who did not, perhaps, enjoy to the same extent those advantages, and that it would be something strange in the eyes of foreign diplomatists if the yerson who held the high office of Minister of Foreign Affairs should fill a secondary part on that occasion. Perhaps the Emperor had formed no definitive resolution, but, even if he had, he not the lers readily would admit the unfitness of such an arrangement. M. de Morny was left at home. Another personage now occupying a high diplomatic post abroad, whose devotion to the Emperor does not date from the commencement of his greatness, has seen the necessity of greatly modifying his deportment towards his official superior. That personage, counting on his old intimacy with the Emperor, was now and then not overmindful of the deference and condescension which were expected from him to his chieffor the Minister of Foreign Affairs Is unquestionably the chief to whom Ambassadors must address themselves. The A mbassador in question occasionally forgot the limits of etiquette. lie addressed himself more than once to the Emperor directly, instead of to his immediate superior. His intentions were good, no doubt, but his practice was irregular. He proffered his advice in frank, honest fashion, and no one is more convinced of his rectitude of purpose and of his attachment to his person than the Emperor himself; but the manner was considered not deferential enough. Of hishonesty no one doubted, but the form it took was a little abrupt. All this, I am assured, has changed. Whatever communications are to be made must now be madeexclusivelythrough the Minister,andthe boldness which private friendship once authorized or tolerated no longer exists. From these and other circumstances I am led to conclude that M. Walewski's position has of late been rather strengthened than wFeakened, that his influence with the Emperor is greater than ever, and that His Majesty has not the remotest intention of depriving himself of the services of a Minister by whose councils he is wont to be directed. Such, at all events, Is the opinion of persona who profess to be acquainted with the state of affairs at the Tuileries as at the Foreign-office. An architect appointed by the Emperor is about to leave Paris, in order to superintend the building of a house for the " Christian Brethren" on a piece of ground granted to that community at Cairo by the Pasha of Egypt. The English and French Government are trying to effect a settlement between Spain and the United States on the subject of the frigate Ferrolana. Five of the St. Helena medals have been sent to Turkey, 100 to Naples, and one only to Persia. A new weekly journal is about to be started by M. Granier de Cassagnac. It will have the rather ominous name of Le Reveil. If M. Granier de Cassagnao's loyalty to the Imperial Throne were not of the most undoubted kdnd some uneasiness mig-ht be felt at such a title. Le Sommeil is quite as euphonous, and much more appropriate, and I should not be surprised if M. Granier de Cassagnac finally adopted it. The same gentleman is said to have very nearly completed a Comedie des Moeurs for the Thiatre Francais. Whoae manners or morals the author means to describe, or satirize, is not said. The erection of wooden booths for the sale of New Year's gifts commenced yesterday on the Boulevards, in the Rue de Rivoli, on the quays, and on several open spaces in the old quarters of the city. They will be shortly filled with a variety of toys and other articles of small value, for which the Parisan manufacturers are unrivalled. It would be difficult for a foreigner to imagine the quantity of materials absorbed in the manufacture of some of these articles. The supply of zinc, for example, used in the making of children's pistols amounts annually to 60,000 Idlogrammes. There arenot iessthan 200,000kilogrammes of the same metal consumed in the preparation of small round mirrors and spectacle-cases. At the time when it was a favourite amusement with ladies to decorate china vases with coloured paper the glass manufactory of Sbvres alone sold 800 francs' worth of vases daily. The most fashionable toys now on sale are rose-coloured balloons, inflated with hydrogen. They have considerably increased the long lIst of children's toys. It is said that there are soveral hundred thousand francs expended in their preparation. The Moniteur publishes the official return of the Cu3toms' receipts for the month of November and for the first eleven months of the year. The amount for November was 12,356,773f., being a decrease of 8, ,027f. on the corresponding period of last year. The produce of the eleven months amounted to IG9,940,205.f, being an increase of 8,404,442f., on the corresponding period of 1856. The Items of revenue which have shown the greatest improvement in the eleven months are-foreign sugar, 10,405.356f.; coffee, 4,310,390f.; wine andespirits, 4,037,527f.; coal, 621,852f.; linenandhempenthread, 85,305f. ; nitrates of soda and potash, 71,429f. ; brass and copper, 57,525f. ; flax, 47,272f. ; gold and silver in bullion and specie, 47.102f.£; mahogany, 35,500f. ; indigo, 29,897f.; aheep and cattle, 16,590f. ; raw silk, 15,29Bf.; linen and canvass, 10,792, ; sundries, 1,950,077f.

VIENNA, Dxc. 2L In my letter of the 18th lnst. it was said that Count Bile Brahe, the Danish Minister at this Court, had made new propositions to Count Rechberg and Baron von Bismarek, the represeatatives of Austria and Prussia at the Genman Diet, but I have since learnt that the statement was only partially correct It is true that the Danih Government has been endeavouring to effect a compromis with the Bund, but nelther Count Bills Brahe, who resides here, nor his brother, wrho was a few days ago at Frankiort, has recently been in direct coznmunication with Count Rechberg and BAron von Tamarok. From Frankfort awe learn that the Emperor of Russia, In his capacity of " agnate of the house of HolBtein-Gottorp," has recently urged the Eing to make concessions to the German Diet, so that it may not have recourie to measures which might possibly lead to serlous complications in Europe. The Rus. sian Cabinet has officially informed the British and French Governments that it has instructed Its ageat at Copenhagen to do all In his power to persuade the Danish Ministers to satlsfy all reasonable wishes of the Bund. Some of the German States would fain " warm up" the Scbleswig question, but they will do well to remember that neither England, France, nor Russia is likely to consent to its being treated as an exclusively German affair. It Is stated here that the firnan of the Porte for the dissolution of the Moldavian and Wallachian Divans ad hoc has already reached Jassy and Bucharest; but the Turkish Embassy positively denies the truth of the report. Some time since you were informed that the Paris Cabinet fully agreed with the Porto in thinking that it would be better to dimsolve the two Divans; and we now learn that it has expressed its opinion on the aubject in a circular, which was addressed to the representatives of all the Poweis that are parties to, thoe Treaty of March. As has above been said, the Kaimakan have not yet been empowered to close the Divans, but we are In daily expectation of learning that they have received the necessary firman. It was stated in various Constantinople letters of the 12th inst. that the Porte had on the 1st of December entered a formal protest against the resolutions of the Moldavian a-nd Wallachian Divans; but the Vienna diplomatists profess to have received no communication on the subject. The German Diet will sanction the convention concluded between France and Baden for building a masive bridge across the Rhine at Kehl, but the fortifications which may appear necesary are to be made on the right bank of the river. It is said that a strong t-de-pant is to be constructed by the federal engineers at the expene of the Grand Duchy of Baden. The freedom of the Danube is sure to be something more than a mere phrase, fcr it is seriously a question of reducing the dues on all the so-called " conventional rivers." France and Pru8sia have expressed their readiness to levy smaller tolls on the Rhine, and Austria has tried to get rid of the onerous Stade dues. Baron Bruck, after having done away with all tolls on the Austrian part of the Elbe, endeavoured to persuade the Hanoverian Government tofollow his example. Negotiations were carried on for some time, but they were at last broken off, because Hanover and the other Riverain States demanded a large capital as an indemnification for the pecuniary loss which they should suffer if they agreed to the abolition of dues and tolls which they have from time immemorial levied on all vessels navigating the river. It may be observed that the HIanoverians have enjoyed the privilege of muicting the commercial public rather more than 800 years. When the ordinance relative to the stamp on newspapers was first published, my remark that the stile of the official writer was anything but lucid was declared to be " malicious." The observation Was simply correct, as is proved by the fact that, since the appearance of the ordinance two explanations of it and three supplements to it have been published. According to the second supplement an allowrance will be made for the stamp on morning papers if sent tothe stamposice by noonon the day of their appearance, aud on the evening p0pers if sent before noon on thefollowingday. Thus conce3sion was made by the Minister of Finance at the urgent request of the proprietors of the Vienna papers. In the evening of Saturday it was definitively settled that the sum of 30,000,000 florins is to be raie(d (by means of a lottery) for paying the expenses of the construction of the Theisa and Western (Elizabeth) Railroads during the year 1858. It has been stated that the PardubitzRochenberg Comnpany Is to have three millions out of the thirty, but my informant contradicts the statement. You may be inclined to fancy that the Credit Bank will have some 'little difficulty in disposing of lottery-tickets of the nominal value of 3,000,0001., but such is not likely to be the case. The money-changers in the city assure me that the people have been so " demoralized" by the lottery loans, that not one man in a hundred now thinks of buying Government stock bearing5per cent, interest. which is to be had at 831. Gambling has become a habit-nay, a neceasity, and many thousands of citlzens have invested a great part of their property in lottery paper. Lotteries, great and small, are permitted by Government, but any person caught playing at rouge-et-noir, roulette, hazard, &c., is liable to be fined 900f1. The Austrian merchants and bankers, whoare perfectly wellinformed of what is passing at Hamburg, are of opinion that the crisis is nearly, if not quite, over. No more silver will be sent from this city, " as Hamburg has seldom or never had so much silver and gold within its walls as at the present moment." Baron Brentano, the Ministerial Councillor in the Finance Department, is back from the city in question. According to the Wiener Zeitung no person will be admitted to the Vienna Exchange who is not provided with a ticket, which CostS about 501. The influenza is extremely prevalent, though in a milder form than is customary here. The patients have rarely much fever, and if proper care is taken they are soon able to pursue their usual avocations. Subscriptions for the sufferers at Mayence are still raised, but many of them cannot possibly be voluntary. Some of the communities figure in the list for 15 and 30 kreutzers, and it is a matter of wonder that people so wretchedly poor give a single farthing to the inhabitants of a place of which they know literally nothing. Lord Stratford has written from Trieste to say that he shall be here to-morrow evening. Prince Alexander of Servla, in order to prevent any crisis, has lent 50,000 ducats to the commercial community of Belgrade. There was a marked improvement on 'Change today. The premium on silver fell to 6 per cent. London at three months was at IOfi. 14k. Credit Bank sbhares roze to 205. THE EARTHQUAKE AT NAPLES. The following particulars relative to the late earthquake in the kingdom of Naples have been received-Two smart shocks were experienced at Naples on the night of the 16th inst.; the first at 10 minutes past 10, which lasted five seconds; the second two minutes afterwards, which lasted 25 seconds. The latter shock caused the two clocks of the Royal Observatory to stop. There were two more shocks between 3 and 5 o'clock in the morning of the 17th, which were scarcely perceptible. A telegram received at Naples on the 18th announced that the telegraphic communications between Eboli and Sala had been interrupted. At Atena the prison, the barracks, and other public buildings had been damaged, and half the houses destroyed. At Padula 100 houses had been overthrown but the number of deaths Is not known. At Poia the disaster is immense, and the victims numerous, particularly among the Gendarmerie. At Auletta, Fetresa, and Caggiano several persons were killed, and many houes destroyed. At Salerno several buildings were damaged, and particularly two churches, the house of the Governor, the barracks, and a church steeple, which fell in the suburbs. The King, on hearing of the disaster ordered his Ministers to spare no expense in aFording rellef to the sufferers. THE PAPAL STATES. A letter from Rome of the 12th, in the Indge dante of Brusels, says:- "The affair of the Mrquis of Canpana continues to produe An immense senstion in this city. In addition to the 200 maen who havo been thrown out of emnployment by the closng of his marble -works, the chlaity school for 300 young girls which he maiahianf lz betA also shut up, a fact whch has given rims to a srong feelimg of diseontent among th, people. The law advisers of the Marquis have unooeded In getting rid of the criminal question, and the affair wiM tierefore now oome under civil jurdicton only. The Govienment has seized, as has been already stated, on the property of M. Caropa for the 570,000 crowns, the amount of his deficit, but lItremins to be seen whethertheMarqus, Inhisbcapacity og director of the Mont de Pl6t, could not make a loan to imself, an- le did to several commercial houses, this esta. blishment at Rome doing the offioe of a commercial bank. An interesting episode connected with this affalr is the fOllowing :-X%dame Campana, the daughter of Mxdame Powell, whose Interferenoe aided in the liberation of the prisoner of Ham, is to leave for Paris immediately, to request the interference of the Emperor in favour of her husband. Dr. Palacci, the phyeician of the family. during one of his vLdts to the 3farquis, took charge of a letter from him to his wife relative to this intended journey. Unfortunately, theDoctor was srohad and the letter found, and he was put under arrest for conveying It."

RAILWAY INTZLZIrOGNCZ. ST. ANDREW'S AND OTlM.RV A meetig of the lss A shareholders in -th-is washeld yesterday at the office, Wbibhall, to reoeive - report from the directors on the subiect of a mere eomplet amalgamation of thbi company with the wNe Brunsick and C;anaa Railway Com any, and toreeeive a report from the committee of shareholders In respect of 10,t00 ac d lnd; Mr. Edwards in thechair. The CHAIRMAN said that their line, which was hden.' constructed by the New Brunswick and Canada Compan had made considerable progrem. The first section of ftrM miles In length, was opened on the let of October last, 'ad tlhe traid not only eovered the working expenses, but left a profit. There were 25 miles more under contract, which would be opened in July next, and then there would remain only 20 miles to complete the line to Woodstock. The cost of the line was less than tha' of any other railway, and was executed within the estimate. The cost of the 40 miles averaged only 2,6171. yer mile, and it was well construeta. The next section of 20 miles In length was estimated to coet on the average 23001. per mile, including everything They had expended 6,000f. on rolling stock, and 7,M more would be required to provide additional stock to work the next secton. When they opened to the end of 60 mils froa St. Andrew's they would have a remunerative traffc. The manager had already mrde contracts for the supply of 13,0001. worth of timber,and with other parties for a similar amount. The country was fertile, and he had no doubt that when a portion of their land was divided into lots of 50 or 100 acres each that emigration to some ex. tent would take place. Since they had proceeded rapidly with their works there had been no further talk of rival lines, and he had no doubt they would eventu. ally be enabled to extend their line from Woodatock to Trois Pistoles, and there form a junction with the Grand Trunk Railway. The object of the meeting was to carry out the resolutions of a former meeting with a view to dispense with the necessity of two distinct boards, two secretaries, and so forth, for what maxy be considered the same under. taking. IIt wag desirable that a complete amalgamation should take place, and that the scrip shares of the St. Andrew's (oin any should become the scrip shares of the New BrunswlcK and Canada Company, and that the 20,000 acres of land granted to the old S. Andrew's Company should be disposed of along with the 20,000 acres recently granted to the New Brunswick Company. The Bill for the amalgamation of the two companies was not yet prepared, but It could not be passed without the asenut of the shareholders (at a speil meetin* convened for the purpoee) holding three-fourths of the capital represented at such meetin&g He concluded by moving a formal resolution to the effect that it was ex dient to amalgamate the capital and land shares of the St. Andrew's and Quebec Company with those of the New Brunswick and Canada Company, and authorizing the directors t proceed with the joint BilL Mr. MA1ADsLAY seconded the motion. Mr. SEIARPE, a director, objected to tho proposed amAl gamatior. on several grounds. He preferred the present positlon of the company until the railway was completed When they got their land he would asent to the measure, but not before, as they might be outvoted if they amalgamnated. The CHAxIpbtA said the directors, with the exception of Mr. Sharpe, were unanimous as to the expediency of the proposed amalgamation. He had raised all sorts of objections, and had made various claims in respect of the land, which had obstructed their proceedinga. Mr. BATzs considered it very desirable that agitation should cease, and that they should null together, which would give more confidence than anyth ele they could do. There was no doubt the line would be finished. Mr. ScRuToio explained that the property of the A shareholders would have been of no value were it not for the formation and exertions of the New BrUnswiCk Company. They eould not do without their assistance, and should go hand in hand with them. Mr. SW.RPE was willing to cease from all differences if they would form an independent land company for the management and dispo3al of the land. After some observations from ir. GOODCH and other sareholders the mot-lori wasdeclared carried by 12 against Mr. Su&mwPE demanded a poll, which reslted in 1,725 capital shares and 1,677 land shares being recorded in favour of the motion, and 656 capital shares aud 851 land. shares against it, the majority in favour of the motion bing 1,069 capltal shares and 826 land shares The report of the committee in respect of the 10,000 actes of land not being prepared, the matter wvas adjourned to the Febrnuar meetIng. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
STATE OF TRADB. MANCHIESTER, DEC. 24. The announcetment of the Bank's reduction of the rate of interest to 8 per cent. was received here at the hour of " high change,' and, although to some extent antiolpated, it caused a more cheerful feeling. In some descriptions of goods sellers have asked rather higher rates. There have been some large offers for goods, but they have not led to much business, buyers refusing to give the advances asked. The last Friday of the month being Christmas-day, accounts havo been collected to-day, and money is reported to have been forthcoming rather better than might have been ex. pected. There have been two small failures here-one of a Greek house-and the stoppage of a cotton broker of some eminence in Liverpool Is spoken of. BRADFORD, DZc. 24. In addition to the dullness which usally prevails at this season, our market is still considerably affected by the recent suspensions in the wool and worsted trade. 'Upon the whole, however, there is somewhat more confidence mani. fested this morning. The prices of the raw material are still nominal, the transactions taking place being in cheap lots. There is some inquiry for cotton yarns, to scertair the terms on which purchases could be made. The business done in pieces is very llmited in extent, being confined to the purchase of the kinds and quantities required to make up assortments for the home trade. Merchants have given out some small orders for goods within the last few days, but altogether the business in this department is inconsiderable. The only new suspension which has been announced here this week is that of MEr. W. Parkinson, worsted spinner, Zetland Mill. His largest creditors are the firm of S. C. Lister and Co., of Halifax. Mr. Parkinson's liabilities to them amount to 6,5001. It is understood that the creditors of Messrs. W. Cheesebrough and Co. are to meet on Tuesday next. The hope is still entertained that this firm wfll be able to make arrangements for paying all their creditors in full. The folowing Is a copy of the balance-sheet prepared by Mr. H. W.

The last two payments are to be guaranteed. Al debts under 50t.-andlall rates, taxes, and servants' wages are to be paid immediately. Thirty creditors were present, and these terms were ultimately agreed to unanimously. The only objection raised against them wras as to the time over which the paymenig are to extend. Mr. Blackburn, however, assured the meeting that, after a close investigation, he felt satisfied that the object could not be attained sooner, seeing that so large a portion of property was in the form of buildings Mr. Alfred Harris, banker of Bradford, and Messs. Joshua Ap, pleyard and Mark Walsh, of Halifax, were appointed a oommittee to represent the creditors in seeing that the above arramngements are carried into effect, and to inquire and decide as to the sufficiency of the proposed guarantee, A local paper says, " the settlement of this concern will, it is hoped, relieve some other firms compromised by this stoppage." The condition of the labouring population here is getting worse. Pauperism seems to be mnreasing in the Bradford Poor Law Union at the rate of upwards of 300 per week. At the meeting of the guardians yesterday the return for the week ending the 16th inst. showed the number of paupers on the books to be 4,618, of whom 3,906 were out-door poor. The total number of in and out door paupers in tha corresponding v'eek of last year was 3 250, showing an increase in the week ending the 16th inst. of 1,368 as compared with last year. In the week ending the 9th inst. the aggregate number of persons in receipt of relief was 4,294, of whom 3,601 were out-door paupers. At the present time there are 400 ablebodied men to whom the labour test is applicable. A committee appointed a short time ago for the purpose of raising subscriptions towards a special fand for the relief of the unemzloyed poor commenced giving relief this mornsag. The re'ief is given both in money and kind, according to the requirements of the recipients, whose cases are previously inquired into by sub-committees in the respective wards. The Irish applicants for the relief are the most numerous, and rather clamorous. Threats of saocking bread and provision shops have been uttered by a few persons of the lowest and least deserving of the male population of the towrn, but the civil authorities are on the alert, and no doubt any overt acts of violence will be speedily and effectually ptt dowln. One open air meeting of working people has been hald this week, but it was of a quiet and orderly character, the speakers being gentlemen connected with the Relief Committee and Board of Guardin who attended for the purpose of announcing the arrangements which were being made for alleviating the distress.

LAW BEPOBT. ADMALTY COURT. TRUBSDAY. DEc. 24. TH.B LINDA FLOR.-JITDaMOM (Before Dr. LUSHiGTON.) The schooner Linda Flor came into collision with the bark Earburg In October, IM6, as she was on her way from Oporto to amburg, and was afterwards salved by the cutter Victoria and conveyed to Grilsby. Proceedlnue were taken against her in this cozrt, and she was con. demned in the sum of 3801. for damage done to the Earburg, and 120. was awarded to the Victoria for the salvage. She was then sold, and the proceeds of the sale deposited in the registry. The master and crew of the LindA Flor, who bad remained with her until the discharge of her cargo at Grilsmny, nowf applied for payment of their wages out of the proceeds of the sle;* but the application was opposed by the owfners of the Harburtg, on the ground that the sumn in the regstry was insudicient to satisfy their claim for damages w, en the bOalace due to the salvors had been paid, The case was argued last term, and Dr. LusrnuGnNoy now delivered judgment. The question raised in this case was, he said, exactly the same as that which he had decided in the case of the Chimera, and he adhered to that decision. When a collision occurred the in jored party bad no means of obtaining redress except from the ship which had done the damage, and to postpone the claim of the injured party to that of the crew would have the effect of so far exonerating the owners of the aslip. There was no hardship inflicted upon the crew in giving precedence to the claim for damages, because their right to sue the owners for the wages due to them remained untouched. Folowig the rule he had laid down ia the case of the Chimera he should pronounce against the claim of the crew. THE GIOVA-iA.-S&LVAGE. This was an action for snlvage, brought by the pilot cutter Alarm, 40 tons, of Falmouth, against the owners of the Austrian vessel Giovanna, 568 tons. The alleged salvage services were rendered on the 1st of July last off the Lizard, the Giovanna being then on her way from Glamorgan to Venice with a cargo of railway iron. The salvors alleged that she was in a sinking state, and that they had great difficulty in preventing the water from gaining on her and in taking her to Falmouth, where she arrived on the morning of the 2d of July. The Giovanna denied that she was in a dangerous state, and alleged that the crew of the tug did notbing beyond piloting her into Falmouth and assisting her own crew in pumping. The value of the vessel and cargo was estimated at about 12,0001 Dr. Spinks and Dr. Swabey were counsel for the salvors; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twias for the owners. Dr. LusuiNGTON awarded the sun of 150l THE GEI'OVA.-SALVAGP. This was also an action for salvage brought by the stmtug Surprise, 100 tons, earrying engines of 120-horse power, against the owners of the screw steamer Genova, 350 tons. In June last the Genova, bound from Palermo to London with a general cargo, came into collision, fitst, with the Norwegian brig Neptunus, and afterwards with the steam. ship Constitation. The Surprise was eruising off Dungeness on the morning of the 18th of that month, when she was ailled by the Genova, and found her, as she alleged, so much injured by the two accidents that she was obliged to tow her towards the shore, and ultimately ground her on the beach about two miles inside Dungeness llghthouse. She was there temporarily repaired and proceeded to London, the tug accompanying her as far as Gravesend. The Genova alleged that the tug was only engaged to keep by her as a matter of precaution; that she was in no danger, and that the crew of the tug had merely assisted her own crew and the crew of a revenue cutter named the Active, in pumping and in repairing the injuries she had received. Thevalueof theship and oargo was estimated at about 15,0004. Dr. Addams and Dr. Wambey appeared for the steam tug; Dr. Deane and Dr. Twisfor the Genova. Dr. LUSYnGTON was of opinion that 4004 would be a fair remuneration for the services rendered, and of that sum he should allot 1501, to the owners, 1201 to the master, and the remaining 1304. to the crew.
COURT OF B4ZVKRUPTCY, B-inghW-9lrW, Dcc 24. IN RE CHARLES WARWICK. (Before Mr. GOmmiSS20ner EvAiR l'e bankrupt was a fancy-dress warehouseman, of 46A, Friday-stroet, trading as Charles Warwick, ;un., and Co. This was an examination meeting. Mr. Reed appeao for the assignees. The bankrupt, examined, said his balance-sheet commenced on the 4th of July, 1855. It showed a capital of 1011. ls. 10d., but he had not a surplus capital at that date. He had given an I 0 U to Mr. Maugham for 4001., and which had to be deducted from the capital. He was a member of the firm of Warwiok, Harrison, and Warwick. It consisted of his father, Mr. Harrison, and himself. That firm was dissolved in 1854, and his father and himself took upon themselves all the liabilities. EHis father became bankrupt in March, 1855. Mr. Chamberlain was his (bankrupt's) creditor on the 4th of July, 1855, for 9001. ; Mr. George Hitchcockr, for 1,2001. ; Mr. Lees, for 300G. ; Mr. Nicholson, for 1801. ; the Provident Life-office, for 1,0001., and Miss White, for 3001. He had not charged these various sums in the account by which the capital of 1011. was ascertained. Hlo had not received more than 7,2371. value for the 13,888M. worth of bills mentioned In pages 8 and 9 of his balance-sheet. The course of his dealings with Messrs. Monteith and Co. was as follows :-Messrs. Monteith and Co. drew bllls on hm, whlch he accepted. They discounted the sane and gave him half the am ount, retaining the other half to their own use. The bills were renewed from time to time, Monteith and Co. remitting him the money to take them up. He had some large transactions with Messrs. Low. They carriedoon business in Broad-street-buildings, and the firm consisted of gaximilian Low and Joseph Low. He was introduced to them by a Mr. Teanby. l. Is now dead. The first transaction was this :-They purchased about June, 1856, a large quantity of goods of him. Then there were cash transa-a tions by exchange of bills. The result was Messrs. Low became bankrupts in January, 1857, and he was then creditor for upwards of 700.6 He had not received any dividend under that bankruptcy. Maximilian Low obtained his certificate in September, 1857. In Junoe 1857, Maximilian Low lent him 1001., which he zeturned in about a week. In July Low sen' him 125Z. on his acceptance due the 27th of October, 1857, and which he bankrupt) paid when it became due. A clerk from Messrs. arrington and Co.'s was then investigating his affairs. Hle did not know then that he was utterly insolvent. On the 2d .A November he filed his petition under the arrangemwent olauses. He believed some muslins sold to Low were now in India. He had had some large transactions with Martin Thode and Co. Thode was the only partner in the firm He was a merchant, at 7, Pope's Head-alley, and owed him 1,1001. Low introduced Thode to him. Thode left England in September, and nothing behind him except a few letters, Thode gave him three bills, drawn by Knight on Griffin, as renewals of other bills. All these bills were diBhonoured, Knight he was told was a guano-merchant at Norwich, and at Bankside. Southwark. He had since found that it would be useless to make inquiries after Knight. Had never heard thatKnight was ealled "Whiskers." Ho had made inquirles about Griffin at Sir Claude Scott's, when he was told that the bills were worthless. He (the bankrupt) had made inquiries about Frances, a merchant in Lime-street. He was banking with Robarts and Co. He did not know whether Frances was in exist. ence, er anything about him. He (the bankrupt) had had some large transactions with Mr. M. Meyer. Meyer owed him about 1,188l. Thode introdueed Meyer to him in January, 1857. The frst transaction was, Meyer lent him some cash. He gave Meyer his customers' bllls in exchange for bills which Meyer gave hium. The result was, Meyer novw owed him 1,1001. Some of these bUls had been in the hands of Maximilian Low. There were bills drawn by Mr. Williams. of London, upon Mr. Van Speehl, of Gresham-street. He saw Mr. Speehl, but made no inquir respecting him. Meyer, he believed, had left England. Knows Mr. Stuhmer, a commission agent and. a friend of Mr. Thode. He was one of the parties who Introduced him to Low. Stuhmer claimed to be a creditor of his. He lived in Waterloo-road. Teanby introduced Stahmer to him. Stuhmer was entered in his balance-sheet as a creditor, but holding goods as security. That was the only transaction he had with Stuhmer. The others bad been commission transactions. He had a commission on the parcel of goods sold to Low. Mr. REED asked for an adjournment sine die. Monteith bad stated that there had been no accommodation bill transactions between the bankrupt and Monteith's house. If this should be established, it would devolve on the bank. rupt to account for goods to the amount of upwards of 6,0001 The bankrupt adhered to his statement. The Co9mmssIoxmx.-Why did you enter upon these accommodation bill transactions? The Bankrupt.-I wanted money to carry on my business. His HoNooR ordered an adjournment sine die, with protection for a lumited period. IN RE STEE)MMAN. The bankrupt was a pianoforte rmanufacturer of Albanysreet, lisgent's Park. This was an examination meetlng. The bankrupt accounted for a sum of 1801. by saying that it had been disbursed in supporting poor relations. The ComMIssioNER said he did not believe the state. ment.

Blakeatone Hinds, aged 27, and William Wise, aged 21, Were indicted for having, on the 26th of December, 1856, assalted and robbed Wlliam Owley of 2521 The Hon. A. Liddell and Mr. Davison prosecuted ; Mr. Seymour defended the priwoner Hinde; the other. pri. soner, by the advice of his counsel (Mr. Price), pleaded 06Guilty." It appeared that the prosecutor on the 23d of December last year received a sum of 2651. from Messrs. Hodge and Hurle, solicitorg of Newcastle. Of this sum there were two notes of 10014 each, 451. in 64-notes, and the rest in gold. This sum the prosecutor, who is a farmer, kept about his person until the 26th of December. On that night he was drinking at the White Hart Inn, in the Low Bar, in Greystreet, N ewcastle, in company with two men named James Reed and William Donkin, and left there at U o'clock worse for liquor, alone. As he was going home up Colingwood-street he was overtaken by Reed and Donkin, and they al went into the Wellington Inn, in that street, where he had some more to drink. He then separated from them and left the inn to go home about a quarter to 12 o'clock, and was proceeding up Marlborough-strest, when he heard footsteps behind himn, and saw two men. Immediately after a man threw his arms round his neck, and he was strangled until he became Insensible, thrown down, and robbed of all the money on his person, and recollected nothing further until he found himself at home, bruised, and with a front tooth knooked out, 3e had afterwards charged Reed and Donkin with being the two men who had robbed him. The prosecution, however, did not rely on his testimony as to the persons who had robbed him. They called William Wise, the urisoner who had pleaded culty, who salted that on the night of the 26th of Decem. ber last year he and the prisoner Hinde lived in Gateshead, and a man named Winship lived in Winlaton, near Gates. head. On that night he was in the Charles XII. publichouse with the prisoner Hinde and Winship and they leftin company at a quarter to 12, when Hinde and Winship asked him to take a walk with them through the town. They all went towards tho Cattle-market and along Marlborough-street, and while there EDinde was at one side of the street and he and Winship on the other, when the prosecutor passed them in the middle of the road and spoke witness and Winshiv. While his face was turned towards them Hinde crossed fiom the other sids of the street, and, rushing upon Owley, put his arms round his neck as described by the prosecutor. Winship said to witness," Come over, here is some money to be got ;" and they then rifled the prosecutor's pocketa of 2661. 7s. 6d. They then all ran away across Knoe's field towards the river, towards the wrestling ground, where there is a gaslight, when the prisoner Hlinde topk the money out of a flat purse and they divided it; after which they crossed the bridge into Gateshead and walked from there to WinlAton to Winship's mother's, to whom Winship gave one of 1001.-notes, part of his share, and she said she would keep it trll It could be changed, and placed it in an old dresser. They then went to a publichouse kept by a man named Reed, to whose wife the prisoner offered the other 1001-note to ohange as a 104.-note, and she told him it was a, 1004-note, and he then took it away. Mrs. Rleed was called and corroborated this statement. A man named Johnson proved that on the night in question he was in Marlhorongh.street at a quarter to 12, when he saw a man fXll and three men run away, leaving the man senseless. That man was the prosecutor. A boy also proved that the day following he found a 5.-note on the road which these three men had taksen. It was also proved that on some of linde's friends calling to see him at the prison he was overheard to tell them "to call on MrWiseand to keep her sweet."Early in thelastyear Winship andtheprisoner Hinde had escaped from the gaol, and the prisoner only had been recaptured. On the part of the prosecution the testimony of the prisner Wise was reled on, corroborated as it was by the evidence of the other witnesses. For the defence it was contended that these witnesses were none of them free from taint, and that Wise had sa'd unless 204 were given to him he would give evidence against the other prisoner. His LoRDsiuP having summed up, The jury found the prisoner Gullty, and Ills LORDsIir sentenced Hinde to be confined in penal samrvitude for 15 years, and Wise to penal servitude for six years John O'Harrow, aged 21, and Wilia n Daley, aged 23, were indicted for having, on the 20th of September last, attempted to drown John Blackpool, with intent to kill and murder him. Mr. Price and M1r. Greenliow prosecuted; and Mr. Seymour defended O'Harrow, and lr. Davison the prisoner Daiy It appeared that the prosecutor, who was mate of a sbip noored at the quay-side, had beenout drinking on the night in question in the town, and was golng on board his ship between 11 and 12 o'clock, when he was suddenly seized by four men, two of whom were the prisoners at the bar, thrown down, and a pocket of his trousers containing his money turned inside out and cut off. While thus on the ground helpless the men seized him by the legs and body, and deliberately threw him over the quay-side into the river, in deep water. The prosecutor was not so stunned as to be unable to try to keep himself afloat, and he contrived to get between his vessel and the quay wall, and by means of his elbows and holding on by projections of the wall to support himself until he was got out of his perilous position. A little girl, named Catherine Riley, who had been selling crockery-ware in the market near, was passing close by at the time with her basket, and said she saw five men go towards the prosecutor as he was going on board his ship, and saw one of the men walk away, and heard him say as he was going away, *' If you are going to rob the man and drown him I will have nothing to do with it." She then saw the other four men, as described, throw the prosecutor down, rifle his pockets as described, and throw him afterwards into the river. The men then ran away, and she leaned over the quay-side to give the manl a hand to help him up, and nearly fell into the river herself in doing so. She spoke positlvely to the two prisoners as being two of the men, and said she had known them both before. When one of them ran away the others cried after him, "f you scutch we will kill you." A policeman on duty on the bridge spoke to seeing the two prisoners and other two men running away over the bridge, and afterwards, on going to the quay-side, he saw the prosecutor getting ou of the river on to the quay very wet and Tbeprisoners' counsel having addressed the jury on their His ILonusmp summed up, and the jury found both pri. soners Gitlty. They were sentenced to 20 years' penal servitude each.

Johanna Callaghan, a street-walker, who has been in the habit of robbing gentlemen on their return from convivial entertainments, was committed for three months as a rogue and vagabond. She had been treated to a rlde in a cab on a very rainy night by a gentleman who thought she was an object of compassion and listened to a very sorrowful history of her troubles, during the recital of which she contrived to steal all the money be had about him and hand it out at the window to an accomplice who had watched the cab. The proseoutor, suddenly finding that aLl his money was gone, ordered the cabman to drive to Bow. lane station, and there charged the prisoner, who said that she was as honest a woman as ever came from Ireland, and that she never before knew what a prison was, but what could a poor woman do among such a host of bad people 9 William Regan was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for having attempted to rob John Whehan of his watch ia Leadenball-market. The prisoner, it was stated, had followed the prosecutor in the market, and the moment an opportunity presented itself tookthewatch out of his waistcoat, but could not break it from the guard, and was caught with it in bis hand. The prisoner said, the crowd was enormous in the market, and it was auite impossible to say wvho wvas the thief, but be was quite confident that he never had engaged in anything of the kind, and he could refer to his character fza number of ears as a proof that he had had no bad experience of any ki=nd.

George Jenkins was charged with being concerned, with two others not in custody, in assaulting and robbing William Austin, a pater and glazier living at 4, Little Mitchellstreet, St. Luke's. The prosecutor said, that at about a quarter to 5 on the previos evening he changed a half-sovereign at a public. ho=IaTothll.swreet to pay his omnibus fare home. He was proceeding tbrough St. Margaret's Churchyard on his way to where the omnibus starts when he suLddenly felt himself tightly grasped round the neck by sdame person's arm. He could not say whether it was a man's or a woman's, as the person was behind him. He had three assailants, as be saw two beides the one whose arms encircled his neck as he had described. Hle was drag1ged down behind, andthen one of thefellowsrifled his pockets of the change of the half-sovereign, some other silver, a medal in commemoration of the peace of 1814, and a penknife. He was stunned by the fall, and when he first recovered he saw the prisoner near him, but he afterwards walked away. A policeman came up, and prosecutor told him what had occurred, at the same time describing the accused, but he could not say whether he was one of his assailants. In answer to a question from the magistrate, prosecutor said, there were more persons standing about near him besides the prisoner when he recovered his senses. Mr. ARNOLD did not think that the circumstance of a robbery of this description being committed with impunity at such a timc and place spolke much for the vigilance of the police, and inquired whether the prosecutor had seen the prisoner at the publichouse where he obtained change for the half-sovereign? Prosecutor said, that he was not there that he was aware ofMr. ANoLD thought it strange that the ccused should have been detained at the station when there was nothing to show that he had taken any part in the robbery. Jaipes Charwood, 104 B, said, that the prosecutor was intoxicated at the time. Mr. Ai'oLD considered, if the prosecutor was Intoxicated, it was a greater reason why the man should not have been detained on his charge. The police said, that the proseoutor positively charged the accus on the night before. It was here stated that there was nothing known to the prejudicoe of the prisoner, who had for some time past been employed in bringing in recruits, and there was a witness present to speak to his character. Mr. A snoLD said, it was unnecessary to hear him, he did not see the slightest thing to affect the character of the accused. He was merely seen among others when prosecutor recovered, and they might as well have been given into custody as he. The accused was discharged, and inquired what redress he bad for the false imprisonment he had undergone. hir. AnNoLD said, he mighb bring an action in the County Court. Wossmr-STsFXwr.-James AIfred Harman, a person of respectable appearanoe, described as a trimming manufacturer, of 27, Anchor-street, Bethnal-green, was charged on suspicion of wilfully setting fire to IDs house and causing the death of three of his lodgers, Mr. Lewis, of Ely-place, attended for the prosecution, and MIr. Sleigh, the barrister, appeared for the defence. Mr. Lewis said,-This case, Sir, bears the appearance of murder from the manner in which it has been entered upon the charge-sheet by the acting inspector, and it is necessary for me to explain that the prisoner rented from his mother a part of the house in Anchor-street which has been destroyed by fire. From inquiries vhich have been made It seems that in March last he insured his furniture for 300M, and his conduct in this matter, first making an excuse which he afterwards denied, appears so fraught with suspicion that, though he seems to have been a ifttle intoxicated, and no doubt excited, and had previously, I believe, attempted to out his throat, X have no doubt you will consider it a case for the most serious investigation, and will ultimately feel bound to send it before a jury. Mr. Atetcalfe, a near relative of the unfortunate persons who have lost their lives, has come from Bath on purpose to have the matter thoroughly sifted, and after calling the necessary witnesses I shall ask for a remand. Mr. Lewis then calleid Policeman Andrews, of the I division, who said,-At half-past 12 on the morning of the 19th inst. I was on duty in Anchor-street, Bethnal-green, when I saw the pisoner come out of a publichouse nearly opposite his own residence. He came uD to me and said, "Policeman, I have been robbed;* my house has been atripped of about 601. worth of goods, my own and my wife's clothing and jewelry. It has had sach an effect upon me that I have made an attempt to cut my throat; Put your finger there and feel it." I did put my finger to hiB throat, and I felt a small ridge, or sort of scratch. I asked him who he suspected had robbed him, and he replied, M My wife and my wife's mother. I wish you would search the premises." I told him to go and see the inspector at the station, but he said, " I will not ; can I get a search warrant ?' I said no, not at that hour of the nuight, and he said he should leave it till tho morning, and asked me to have something to driak, which I declined. He then went back to the publichouse, and I next saw him about half-past L He was at that time about half drunk, and had a kind of swaggering manner. He was then carrying a gaUon can of beer towards his own house. He bade me 'Good night" as he passed me, and went in, and I next savw him about 3 o'clock. He was then standing still at the corner of an opposte place called Anchor-court, about 20 yards from his house. He asked me if I knew him, and on my telling him I did he walked down to the bottom of the court where he at first said he should go in to bed, but corrected himself directly, and said he should go to his brother's, or brother-in-law's, at the westend, to get him to look after his premises. I at that moment looked across to his premlsea, and saw what I thought was gasburnig, the light shining through the cracks at the bottom of his shutters. I on that looked up, and then saw smokeissuing from the top part of the shutters. I exclaimed, "Good God, Harman, why your place is on fi e; do you know it?" He said, "Where?9' and wo both ran across to the house. I gave an alarm with my rattle, and at that time the lower part of the house was in flames. The prisoner ran against the shop door, and burst it open with his body. I did not at that time see any one upstairs, but in three or four minutes after I saw a woman at the second floor front window. The prisoner then tried to enter the house, but could not in consequence of the flames. I sent for the fire esc-ape, and the prisoner then went to the side door, and ran against that, but it would not give way, and he then went into the next house. As I returned from the side door to the front I saw a woman with a child at the window. The house the prisoner went into is that of his mother-in-law. I think the door of that house was open; I did not hear bim say anything, and I did not see him again. I did nob know who the woman was that I saw upstairs at the window, but she was in her night dress. Cross-examined by Mr. Sleigh.-The prlsoner appeared excited, as drunken people usually are, when telling me he had been robbed. We talked together three or four m inutes, and he seemed worse when I spoke to him the third time than he did before. On our discovering the fire the prisoner appeared wild and excited, moro so tban when I first saw him. He walked rather staggering, but I understood very we6L what he sid. Sergeant Egerton.-On the morning in question I went to the house, and found it in flames about half-way up; they reached across the pavement. Some people called out, " Persons are in the house, and have made their way to the top." I went into the adjoining house, and ascended to the attic, and saw tlae prisoner there and two persons bolding him. He seemed drunk and excited. Sergeant Purchase then came In, and I told him to take the prisoner downstairs. The prisoner said, "There's people in the house; I have been talking to them." I passed along the parapet of that house to that of the one on fire, and saw an officer on the roof. I broke several windows to get one open and called out loudly, but could not make any one hear. At that time the smoke was so very dense it was completely suffocating. I looked over the parapet and saw the fire-escape coming up the street, and the fames were at that time half-way across the road, The escape was put up against the house No. 28, hut the escape-man could not enter the burning house, the flames were so great. He got his body partly in, hut was obliged to draw back. I had seen three bodies lyingin one of the rooms they appeared to nave been suffocated, and not burnt much, After the bodies were found and the fire put out I saw the prisoner in a house opposite. He was in the parlour, and I told him to come out to me, He did so, and I told him that from what I had heard I thoughtthere was something very serious, and that I was going to question him, but I cau+:-ned him. I then asked him if he had been in a court that night, and he said no, he bad not. I asked, "H Has your house been robbed?" and he answered "No, it bas not." I said, "Did you teU the policeman that it had?" and he replied, "No, I did not." I said, " Did the woman who appeared at the vindow call you a villain and wretch?" He answered, " No, not a wretch, but a villain." I asked, " Why should she call you a villain?" and he said. " I don't know, unless it is abont a dispute with my wife." I said, " There is something very strange about this affair," and he replied, " I don't know, I am innocent; you can take me into cestody if you like." The prisoner was at the in quest which Was held upon the dead bodies, and I took him in charge by direction of the coroner. He appeared quite soberduring the conversation I have just given. When the persons were holding him it seemed to me that it was to prevent his going on to the parapet * his manner evinced iundI a wish. Mr. Thomas Metcalfe.-I am a fringe and tassel-maker in Lower Borough-wall, Bath. On Monday last I saw three dead bodies at the Bethnal-green deadhouse. One was the body of John Motcalfe, the other that of Anne Metcalfe, my wife, and the third that of Julia Maria Metcalfe, a child between seven and eight years old. Mr. Lewis.-This is a very important case, in support of 'which I have several other witnesses to examine, and must therefore request a remand. The coroner himself suggested that the prisoner should be given into custody. Mr. Sleigh.-I supposed Mr. Lewis would adduce much stronger evidence than that given at tho inquest, but he has not. I am thankful the coroner suggested this inquiry for the sake of the prisoner himself, but I trust the prisoner will not be kept in, custody, as he has firmly stood his ground in spite of the strong Zeeling displayed against him. I deny the coroner entertained any idea of the prisoner's guilt; ke merl thought justice wrould be best obtained by an Investition before a * The prisoner ha not lived happllyith bis wife, wo7mm ay perhaps, be some exonse for him,bat Iun ttiAiackmowldedge It Is lamentable Ie should have given Way to such a besottd state of drunkeinees.

THAXES.-Mr. Jones, engineerto the Commercials Company, bteney,waited on Mr. SKrFE, and sated that a Mon named =swtcl, atailor In Green-street,Stepney, nearly opp*eite the Scotch Church, had been fined 101. by hia worship for surreptitidusly using the Company's gas after the pipes in his cellar had b6eendisconnected or non-pay. ment of arres due to the company. It was the constant ractice of the Commercial Gas Company to appropriate all es levied upon persons who defrauded the compn;± of their gas to charltable purposes. The fine Inflicted upon Aishwell had been recently paid, and he now begged leave to band it over to the magistrate for the purposes of the poor-box fund. A fine of S inmficted upon a pnblican the Mile-end-road by Mr. Yardley for a similar offence had been equAlly divided between the Thames Polioe-court poor-box, the London Hospital, and another chaitable institution. Mr. SEiSE said he would accept the donation on behalf of the poor, but had he known it was the intention of the Commercial Gas Company to appropriate the fine in the manner proposed when -he heard the case he should not have accepted it, becauLe it ought not to be supposed that the magistrates could be infuenced In their decisins by the probabiity of having fines inflicted upon offenders put into thepor-box.

TRADE OF THEI .JNTiED STATES WITSH FANCE.- The burdens imposed by the French tariff upon the " raw materials" of industry are particularly obnoxious to the observations of Mr. Buchanan, and particularly unfavourable to our trade with France. The manufacture of cotton In France has by no means kept pace with the productive development of the empire, as it might have done had the raw material beer. freely supplied. The same phenomenon is exhibited by the cotton manufactnres in France which is afforded by the woollen manufactures of our own country, and the remedy is as plain in the one case as in the other. In 1836 France consumed 118,000,000 pounds of cotton against 86,000,000 consumed in the United States. With each successive year we gained on France till in 1845 both nations stood at precisely the same figure of 158,000,000 pounds; since which time the relation has been reversed, and at present we consume 70,000,000 pounds in excess of France. More important, however, than the cotton question is the growing question of the trade in iron. Tho iron production of this country is now entering upon the most critical perlod of its history, and it should be an object of the first consequence to our statesmen to provide for the ,rouer expansion of its commercial capabilities. The French duties upon iron are practically prohibited along the wihole line of the French frontier, except on the belt which stretches from Blanc-.Iisseron to Alont Gendvre. where the duty faUs 3 francs per 100 kilogrammes. Every branch of French industry feels the paralyzing effects of this weight upon its development, for iron is not less essential to the circulation of the whole industrial body than to the vital circulation of the human system. We have dwelt upon the trade in cotton and in iron with specific remark because of the leading importance of these articles to the export commerce, present and future, of the UTnited States, as well as the industry of France; but it is impossible to glance over the schedules of French commerce without perceiving that the whole trade of France with this country is susceptible of a very great legitimate expansion under the operation of a more liberal commercial system. Most men habitually forget that until within the last 300 years the maritime commerce of mankind bore a very inconsiderableproportion to their overland traffic, and nothing is more common than for those who confound trade with ships to underestimato the commercial importance of France -when compared with England and the United States. Bat while England and the United States are geographicaUy compelled into the position of traders by sea, France enjoys a vast continental intercourse with the nations of Europe, and in virtue of this intercourse attains tho second place among the nations of the earth, In 1855 the values of the foreign comnmerce of the three leading countries stood as follows, in round numbers :-England, $1,340,000,000; France, $800,000,000; the United States, $340,000,000. Our own share of the commerce of France in the same year amountedto $91,000,000, considerably lessthanone-third of the contemporaneous value of our trade with England. Nor has the increase or our commereo with France kept pace with the growth of the commerce between France and Great Britain. In 1830, when England and FranEs were fighting each other with duties, their mutual trade amounted to about $15,000,000. In the same year we exchanged with France to the value of nearly $19,000,000, The relaxation of hostile restrictions on either side of the channel has brought about a wonderful change, In 1855 the excess of the English over the A.merican coDm. merce with France was no less than $71,000,01;0. Such a result as this in the face of the enormous development of out national capacity, both as producers and consumers, is certaily not satisfactory, and gives additional weight, if suon wrere needed, to the animadversions of the President upDon the state of our relations writh France,-ffzo York 1n'ies,

TRB LATE M1B. COLVYIN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIAIES. Sir,-It is not right that a man like John Calvin, the Lieutenant-Governor of Agra, should p-zss from among us without some notice. fie be)onged to that higher portion of the middle class to which England owres the formation and mairntenance of her wonderful ndiant empire. He war, the recond son of James Colvin, of the we]l-knwwn mercantile house of Colvin and Co., of Londou. and Calcuttta, and was boen at Calcutta in MaY, 1807. Ee was educated 'ill near the age of 15 at St. Andrew's, in Fifeshire, and after a short time passed with a private tutor he went to the EaAt India Oollege at Ilaileybury. Here he obtained, from the first, the highest place among his eontemporaries, ande held it throughoui. Althoigh young men who wasted their time at Raileybury sometimes exhibited suaperior qualities in after life, those who were distinguieshed im the coNlegiate competition scarcely ever failed to prove themselves able public servants. The Colege itself has now ceased to exist, and there is-reason to fear that some advantages have, for the moment, been lost with it -which are esserntial to the success of our Indian administration. The stadents were taken at the critical period of life, after they had finished their school education, and before they had struck root in this count.y or tried their powers with the young men of their owvn age from other seminaries. There was, therefore, the usual proportion of men of superior ability among them; and from the eerliest years of opening manhood their thaughts and feelings became identified vith their Indian prospects. They then received the best instruction that could be provided for theni in the principles of law and political economy, in the elements of the Indian languages, and in other subjects which had a special reference to their professional duties. ow, the age of admnission is put so high that a sifting has already taken place, and those who have proved their strength have paired off for an English career, which must always have the highest attraction for te fir.st class of our English youth. Another consequence of raising the age to 23 is that the professional instruction and probation which thoqo who have had practical experience of India know to be enecessary, have been given up, and the transplantation takes place under circumastances every wiay calculated to aggravate the growing evil w;hich has been remarked of late years -that our Indian officers do not give themselves up to their wvork with all their heart as they used to do-that their thoughts and aspirations are directed to England, and that whatever concerns the natives is performed in a cold and perfunctory maanner, which neither can command nor deserves success. Colvin went to India in 1826, passed the College of Fort W'illiam with credit, and entered at once on the serious business of life as assistant to the register of the Sudder Court, Mllr. iMIacnaghten, afterwards so well known to fame as Sir William Macnaghten. The remembrance of much pleasant intercourse at this period enables me to say that although John Colvin " lived laborious days," he did not scorn those delights which belonged to his age and character; and he then gained the affections of a lady (Harriet, daughter of MIajor Sneyd), who became a faithful and helpful companion to bim for the rest of his life. His next appointment was Assistant to the Resident at Hyderabad, Mr. William Byam. Mlartin, who still survives in the enjoyment of the cultivated literary tastes for which he was remarkable even during the most active period of his Indian career. In 1832 Lord William Bentinck created the office of AssistantSecretary in each of the Government Departments at Calcutta on the model of the English Under-Secretaryahips, and Colvin was selected to be Assistant Secretary in the Revenue and Judicial Department, and was promoted in 1836 to be Secretary to the Board of Revenue in the Lower Provinces. Lord Aucklanad took his seat as Governor-General on the 4th of March, 1836, and what he did to discover the best man to be his private secretary is worthy of the attention of all who require able assistance for the discharge of important duties. He asked those who were in a position to form a correct judgment, to furnish him with lists of the persons whom they considered lit in the order of qualification. Lord Auckland's honest anxiety received a rich reward. Of the few enjoyments of office, one of the highest is that of being well served; and how ably and zealously Lord Auckland was served by Joln Colvin will be apparent from the following grateful record:- " 3fr. Colvin has worked, I may say, rather with me than under me, during six years. He has had and he has demerved i4y entire confidence. He brought to his duties an extensive and accurate knowledge of the interests of India in its history asd in tha details of its administration. "This knowledge has been greatly increased, particularly ia regard to our political relations; and if the merit of having brought forward, from time to time, subjects of difficulty with clearness and regularity before the Council shotld ever be ascribed to me, it oould not be so in justice, unless ackirowledgruent were also made, as I am ready to miake it, of the indutstry, the researob, the correctness of judgnment. the accuracy of information, and the readiness in composition, with which Mr. Colvin has often adaisted me. "I may add that in the secondary but impoitant duty of forming a judgment en the character of public oflicers and in the distribution of patronagp, I have wvith equal satisfaction to speak of the faithful and ebicient aid which I have found; and though it could not be but that offence and dissent in this branci, of duty should occasionally have been excited, yet I cannot but feel that it is due to the tact and disorimination with which Mr. Colvn has performed his part in this branch of the administration that so little of discontent has been exhibited upou it. and that 'its fairuess has been pretty generally admitted." 5r. Colvin returned with Lord Auckland to England, and both mind and body were refreshed by a three years' furlough. After the recomnencement of Mis Indian career he held for a short time the appointment of Resident in Nepaul, and was then transferred to the Conimissionership of the Tenasserim Provinces, where his administration gave much satisfaction both to the (xovernment and the public. His measures regarding the timber trade were held to be particularly useful, aud he did much good by framiing an uniform code of procedure for the native judges. He was next promoted to the Sudder Court, where he became facile piinceps. so much so that it was commonly said that the pleaders had sometimes to be reminded that they ought to address the Court and not Mr. Colvin. As he had not had a regular judicial training, aad his knowledge of law was chiefly derived from the vigour with which he applied to the study of it at the time, this was jtistly considered as a remarkable proof of his intellectual superiority. lWhen, therefore, he wag appointed LieutenantGovernor of the North-Western Provinces, on the death of Mr. ihomaason, in 18a3, there was certainly no man in the service whose name stood higher for activity, ability, and force of character, and he had beer already marked out as a fit man for Council. As Lieutenant-Governor he exhibited an industry and mastery of detail which were quite astouishing. HIe had not the practical professional knowledge of Thomason, whlo had been a magistrate alid collector, and had made settlements ; or of John Lawvrence, wvho had served in eery department, from top to bottonm; but for this ho made up by the mnost laborious iquiry. He could not do things offhland like his predecessor, from his own know- ledge; he had to ascortain before deciding; he was perpetually asking questions, gathering opinions, collating facts, and he carried this to an extent that has been rarely eq.ualled. The reports he called for were inuarmerable, and he digested his information with exezmplary patiene and impartiality. A general efficiency in all branies was fully maintained. There was no great attempt to iitroduce nev measures, but rather thoroughty to work out old ones. iEverything that hacl been previously commnenced was taken -up and,acarried on towards perfection. The earnest adoption of everything that was goo(d in Thomason's plans shoxwv how thoroughly Colvin had ihe public interest at heart, and furnishes an honourable contrast to the xanal disposition of public men to (leprociate their predecessors and to connect their own nanzes witl new measures of which they alone would -kave the credit. 3Ie. Colv-in was also laudably desirous of tesiting the qualifieations of his offiaers. He would sometimes invite conferences of cecers, and ilsake each state his opinion. He was sincerely anxious to prefer merit to seniority, and to get ihe ri,ght maan in the right place. Bie made many told appointments out of routine, the judiciousnessof some of which was, of course, questioned. In all respects he was desirous to discover improved methods of -doing things, and was most ready to listen to suggestions. He took an especial interest in the detection and suppression of crime, and by w;rore bezl a" satMl gupervision kept th e vwhnlo SsIlc. of the po!;ce on the alert. Every great orime that became k1-vvn Mr. Colvinwould ordertobe reportedl on for his informaation. A magistrate woluld receive a letter to say that the Lieutenant-Governor anxiously awaitedthe news of the capture of such aud such a DfacDit or murderer. Anything like organized crime received constant attention from the Lieutenant-Governor himself. In the Department of Civil Justice much was ,expected of Mr. Colvin, -Ps being himself an eminent judge; but nothing short of a decided legislative enauoment will ever enable a Governor of a Reg-ulation Province to reform the present cumbrous and unsuitable system. In the Revenue Department Mr. Colvin did much for the settlement of the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, then recentlyattachedto -his Governmeut,introducing thoseimprovenents, the advantage of which had been established by the experience of the Ptunjab; and he -was arranging for the renewal and revision of the settlement in the North-Western Provinces which was about to expire. He was strongly impressed with the importance of moderate and fixed assessments of the land revenue as the foundation of all improvement. In the Public Works Department the new system resulting from the abolition of the Military Board at Calcutta, and the placing of all works, civil and mnilitary, under the local Governments, came into operation under Mr. Colvin. He scrutinized that monster department wvith his usual energy and minuteness, and in no part of India did it work better than with him. The Ganges Canal, the offspring of Thomaion and Cautley, was prosecuted to completion by Colvin, and the cnall itself was opened by him. Road-making was advanced everywhere, but the questionable English expedient of tollbars was introduced on the Grand Trunk-road. In education Colvin followed up vigorously the good beginning made by Thomason, and he afterwards inaugurated, with much ability, the more comprehensive and important system, ap- plicabVe to the whole of India, which was ordered' from home. The machinery for popular vernacular education, which had previously existed in eight experimental districts, wag then extenc7ed to all. In all miscellaneous improvements MIr. Colvin was most zealous and public-spirited, as was to be expected from his turn of mind, which readily crappled with anything and everything that presented itself. In his conduct towards the press he was always liberal and successful. Lord Auckland had the cordial support of the Calcutta press during the period of alarm and depression caused by the disasters of the Allgh-han war, and the spirit of Mr. Colvin's proceedings on this subject, when he afterwards acted on his own responsibility, will be seen from the lollowing extract from his general report on the administration of the North-Western Provinces for the year 18D55- :- " It is the custom of this Government to print for offieial circulation, in aldition to the published reports and orders on the administration of civil and criminal justice, and of the general revenue affairs of the year, as well a3 the pab. lished annual prison discipline and educational reports, theI remarks and instruct'ons wvich are Tecorded in detail on the separate divisional reports on police, revenue, road, and ferry funds, srd local funds and improvements. A common sympathy and emulation are thus, It is beliaved, excited throughout the provinces, and the experi-nce of success or defects in one district becomes known for the benefit of all." As Judge of the Stidder Court at Calcutta, and Lieutenanit-Governor of the North-Western Pro- 1 vinces, Colvin laboured under the disadvantage of not having had a practical training in the revenue, police, and judicial departments, which form the baais of our Indian Admiuistration. To a great extent he overcame this by extraordinary industry and sagacity, but this entailed a serious waste of effort. It was a common saying that Mr. Colvin CC overgoverned." The businems of the Government greatly increased, so that the secretaries could hardly keep pace with it. The nuumber of letters nearly doubled in two years. Our best Anglo-Indian statesmen have alivays struggled against the terdency to fill the oflices at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, with persons who have not had practical experience of the details of administration. The advantage of misxing with the European society of the Presidencies and the hope of becoming immedliately connected with the Government havo powerful atitractions, and it is therefore distasteful to young oflicers to be detached to distant stations, at which alone they can obtain a practical knowledge of the service in its different branches. But public officers cannot properly superintend what they do not fully understand; and the various action of an administrative system cannot be properly understood without actual personal experience of it. When the Calcutta element has predominated in the secretariat, the Government has always suffered in popularity and general coifidence, It ought to be insisted on as an invariable rule, that every officer should sei me at least a five years' apprenticeship in the Mofussil before he is appointed to an office at any of the Presidencies. From these works of peace and improvement, and from the apparently certain prospect of fnishing his course with honour and joy, Colvin was suddenly called to face the stern realities of the mnilitary insurrection. With a higher official position he had less real command over events than his neighbour ia the Punjab. John Lawrence ruled a people who had for generations cherished a religious and political feud with the people of Hindostan proper, and Delhi was, in Sikh estim?,tion, the accursed city drunk with the blood of saints and martyrs.t John Colvin's Government was itself the focus of the insurrection. Lawrence may be said to have been his own commander-in-chief; and after an European force had been detached to Delhi immediately on the outbreak, he stiU had at his disposal seven European regiments (including the one sent from Bombay to Mooltan), besides European artillery and a local Sikh force of abouit 20,000 first-rate Irregulars of all arms. Colvin was merely the civil governor of the North-Western Provinces; and, as the posts were stopped,'+ he could not even communicate with the Commander-in-Chief, with whom the entire disposal of the military force rested. Lawrence had three days' exclusive knowledge by tolegraph§ of what had taken place at Meerut and Delhi, during which interval he made his arrangements for disarming the Sepoy regiments stationed in the Punjab. Colvin had no warning; and the military insurrection had actually broken out within his Goverunient, and the mutineers were in possession of Delhi before he could begin to act. But he promptly and vigorously did what was in his power. On the 1,th of May the Governor-General telegraphed to MIr. Colvin, " I thank you sincerely for all you have so admirably done and for your stout heart." He held a parade of the troops atAgra, and spoke plainly and fully to the native regiments on the subject of the gross delusions which prevailed among them regarding the supposed intentions of the Government to interfere with their religion and caste; he miade arrangements to strengthen the fort and place in it a considerable amount of supplies; he raised a body of voldnteer horse, who afterwards did good service on several *Before this Mr. Thomason had mado great use of the press rs an instrument of government. Bcsides the conip.ete and formal reports published by all the Indian Governments, he always kept ia hand a volume of Selections from the Becords of the Govern2rent, by which a permanent and pnblic form waa given to a great variety of valuable miscellaneous papers which would otherwise have faUen into oblivion. Correspondence on particular proposals was often separately published, and discussion invited. Every department of Glovernmnent was benefited by the manuals, treatises, and digests of information which able and expenienced officers were encouraged to prepare. Without the aid of the press the English in Iadia would be isolated units. Those who object to the Indian press as oxpressing the public opinionof thie oonquerors ought to turn to the (Calcutt Revsiew, where they will see every subject in which the welfare of the natives is concerned discussed with a practical ability and an earnest benevolence whioh reflect honou r upon the Engiesh niame. t The death scene of Bunda, who succeeded t-ovind as military leader of the Sitkhs, is tbus described by COptain Canningnam in his valuable bistory, p. 86 :-" His son was placed upon his knees, a knife was put in his hands. and he was required to take the lire o! his child. He did so silent and unmoved; his own flesh was then torn with red hot nincers, and aid these torw ents he expired, his dark soal, eay the IabeomedasIV, winging its way to the region of the damned." The nature of the retaliation is alluded to at p. 103, in reference to the captuire of Lahore by the Sikhs: -" Numerous mosquer were demolished and Affgllans in chains ivere made to wach the fou-2dations with the blood of hogs." Govind's father, and predecessor in the religious aod mnilitary chiefebip, Tegh Beh;dr, was also ignomiainusly put to death at Delhi hy Aurksgzebe. e The following are from Mfr.

"GeneraUy a distinction should be drawn between the regiments which murdered their officers and those which did not. To men of the latter forbearance in the first instance and hope of pardon, if they should show a claim to it, may be ex:cnded. "1,Menaces are quite unnecessary. 'II beg you to communicate this to the Commander-in. Chief." F " There is reason to believe that in some even of those native regiuients whose revolt has been stained by the wome sanguinary atrocities some men may have distinguished themselves from the mass by protecting an officer. In sorne such cases men of very guilty regiments possess certificates in their favour from officers of their regiments; bitt there may be others equaUy deserving of clemen^y who are with. out any sach ready means of clearing themselves from tlte presunmptive evidence of their deep guilt. "1 Where the rinmber of men guilty of what it is impossible to pardon is so great, the Government will glally seize every opportunity of reducing the work of retribution before it by giving a free pardon to all who can show that tbey bave a claim to mercy on this ground, provided they havo not been guilty of any heinous crime against person or property, or aided or abetted others in the cominission of any such crime. *' Every mitineer or deserter who may be taken before or apprehended by the civil authorities, and who may be ound to belong to a regimens which killed any European officer or other European, or comlmitted aDy otber sangiainary outrage, msy be tried and punished by the civil power.

Although we may at pro. sent say withthe clfisi page,"Lost! lost ! lost!" tblaboars of Robert Bird, Thomsoan, and Colvin will not be in vain. The military and predatorv classes have gone against us, baG use mass of the population Is with us, and as soon as wecanl again give them protection, order will be rapidly restored. We owe this to the admirable series of measures beginning with R. Bird's 30 years' settlement, and to the general im pression which has been produced that we have the interests of the people at heart. JA iErn Cvlvi, M as At GCNoa with their younger&M-sQ.o,h occasions; and he called upon the neighbou'u native States to send their " contingents" to assist in keeping open the roads and preserving the peace of the country districts. He also had the good sense and Bpirit to deprecate any premature aban-. donment of our position.- " It is a vitally useful lesson to be learnt from the experience of preeent events that not one step should be yielded in retreat on an outbreak in India which can be avoided with any safety. Plunder and general license immediately commence, and all useful tenure of the country is annihilated. It isnot by shutting ourselves in forts in India that our power can be upheld, and I will decidedly oppose myself to any proposal for throw;ng the European force into the fort except in the very last extremity." (Mr. Colvin to the Governor-General, May 22, 1857.] As early as the 15th of May Mr. Colvin urgently recommended the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General for the purpose of disabusing the Sepoys of the delusions which possessed1 them, and of inducing the well-disposed among them to separate themselves from the mnutineers. On the 24th of May he reiterated this advice- "On the mode of dealing with the mutineers I would strenaously oppose general severity towards all. Such a course would, as we are unanimonsly con vinced by a knowiledge of the feeling of the people, acquired am:ong them from a variety of sources, estrang e the remainder of the army. Hope, I am firmly convinced, should be held out to all those who were not ringleaders or actively concerned in murder and violence. Ilany are in the rebels' ranks becaume they could not get away * many certainly thought we were tricking them out of their caste and this opinion is held, however unwisely, by the mass of the population, and even by some of the more intelligent classes. Never was delusion more wide or deep. Many of the best soldiers in the army-among others, of its most faithful section, the Irzegular Cavalry-show a marked reluctance to engage in a war against men whom they believe to have been misled on the point of religious honour. A tone of general imenace would, I am persuaded, be wrong. The Commander-in-Chief should In my view be authorized to aot upon the above line of policy; and when means of escape are thus open to those who can be admitted to mercy, the remnant w.ll he considered obstinate traitors even by their own countrymen, who N;il have no hesitation in siding against them. I request the earliest answer to this message. The subject is of vital and pressing importance." On the following day (25th of May) Mr. Colvin reported to the Governor-General that he had himself taken the decisive step:- "Impressed by the knowledge of the feelings of the native population, as comiunicated in my message of yesterday, and supported by the unanimous opinion of aU officers of experience here, that this mutiny is not one to be put down by high-handed authority, and thinking it essential at present to give a favourable turn to the feelings of the Sepoys who have not yet entered against us, I have taken the gra e respcnsibility o' issuingon my own authority the following proclamation. A weighty reason with me has been the total dissolution of order and the loss of every means of control in many districts. My latest letter from Meerut is now seven days' old, and not a single letter has reached me from the Commander-in-Chief. " PROCLsA.LVIION. "Soldiers engaged in the late disturbances, who are desirous of going to their own homes, and who give up their arms at the nearest Govermment civil or military post, and retire quietly, shall be permitted to do so unmolested. 't Many faithful soldiers have been dziven into resistance to Government only because they were in the ranl-s and could not escape from them, and because they really thought their feelings of religion and honourinjinredbythe measures of Government. This feeling was wbolly a mistake, but it aoted on men's minds. A proclamation of the Governor. General now issued is perfectly explicit, and will remove all doubts on these points. "Every evi'-minded instigator in the disturbance, and those guilty of heinous crimes against private persons, shall be punished. All thoso x'ho appear in arms against the Government after this notification is known shall be treated as open enemies." The time has not yet arrived when this subject can be reviewed withjudicial calmness; but Colvin is no longer among us to answer for himself, and it is impossible in a notice of his life to pass over as point to wlhich public attention has been so strongly directed. Mly object is not to revive the discussion, or to maintain that the proclamation was free from objection, but to give, as nearly as it can be ascertained, the defence which Colvin would have made if he had been alive. He might have relieved himself from all responsibility by not issuing any proclamation without the previous sanction of the Governor-General,but his position as localGovernor, ac'ing with the Oommander-in-Chief for the suppression of the insurrection in his government, and his strong sense of the necessity of the mueasure, made him take another view of his duty. The cotrse adopted by John Colvin is the usual one on such occasions-in other words, it is the mode of treatment for mutiny and rebellion wvhich has been sanctioned by the experience of the world. The mutiny at the Nore and the Irish rebellion are the last two cases in point in English history, and it will be seen how they were dealt with in this respect:- "ROYAL PROOL&MATION, NTED TisE 27Trt MAY, 1797. "Andwhereas we are well assured that agreat part of the seamen and marines on board the said ships at the Nore abhor and detest the criminal proceedings which are still persisted in on board the said ships, and are desirous to return to their dlty - " Now, we being desirous to extend our gracious inten. tions of pardon to all such seamen and maarines so serving on board our said ships at the Nore who may have returned or shaU return, upon the notification of this our Rovyal declaration, to the regular and ordinary diseharge of their duty, bave aethorired, &c., the Lords Commissioners of our Admiralty to signify to all such seamen and marines who may have been guilty of any of the treasonable acts aforesaid, or of any mutiny or disobedience of ordera, or neglect of duty, and who have returned, or who s-hall upon notification hereof on board the respective ships, return to the regular and ordinary discharge of their duty our Royal intentions to grant to all such seamenadrmarines our most gracious pardon, and to promise in our name to all sach seamen and marines who have so returned, or shall so return to the regular and ordinary discharge of tbeir duty, our most gracious pardon accordingly. And we do hereby declare that all such seamen and marines who shall have so roturned, or shall return to their duty, and to whom the said Lords Commissioners of our Admiralty shall so promiss our pardon, shall receive the same accordingly, and shall b a discharged and released from all prosecutions, imprisonments, and penalties incurred by reason of any of the act; aforesaid, or by reason of any act of mutiny or disobediencea of orders, or any breach or neglect of duty previously committed by them or any of them." There were tu-o other proclamations to the same effect in the same year, one dated the 221 of April, and the other the Gth of June. The following is from the preamble of the Irish Act of Parliament, 38th of George III, cap. 55, entitled " An Act for the King's most graciouns, general, and free pardonl .'* "The King's Most Excellent Majesty beingalways desirous to show his royal inclination to mercy, and considering that divers of his subjects have rendered themselves obnoxious to the laws, and subject to the highest penalties by being concerned in the un natural rebellion which had brokenu forth in this kingdom, from which they can in no wise be freed but by His Majesty's great goodness and clemenor; and being graCiously inclined to encourage all his loving subjects to return and continue in their due obedience to His Majesty, rather by acts of grace and mercy than by a severe execution of justice, and desirous of quieting theamids of his subjects in general, hath, upon mature delibera. tion, resolved and determined to pant his general and free pardon in a large and bountiful manner, not doubting but that, however it may be received by those who are obstinately bent on the ruin of their country, it wUl raiso a dae sense of gratitude in all who have been artfultv misled into treasonable practices against his person and Government, and preserve them and others fron standing in need of the like mercy for the future, when such clemency mxay not be so expedient for the public welfare as ib would be agreeable to His Majesty's inclination, and hoping that all his subjects by this act of grace will be induced henceforth with more cheerfulness and affection to applytheinselves in discharge of their respective duties to His Majesty, and to live in a loyal and dutiful obedience to him; therefore His Majesty is well pleased and contented that it be enacted, &c., that all and every His Majesty's subjects of this His Majesty's kingdom of Ire- latim, their heirs, successors, executors, and administrators, an i every of them shall be, by the authority of this present Parliam,ent acquitted, pardoned, released, and discharged against the King's Most Excellent Majesty, his heirs and successors, and every of them, of and from all stLch treasons, misprisious of treasons, felonies, seditious and unla%7ful meetings, treasonable anad seditious words or libels, and also of and from all such riots, routs, offences, contempts, trespaisses, Pains of death, pains corporal, and pains pecuniary, and generaly of and from aU such other thsng6, causes, qruarrels, suits, and executioni whEich havc been had, made, done, committed, perpetrated, incurred, or forfeited -in proscuion or furtherance of the said rebellion befere and until the 22d day of August, 1798 and which can o, may be by His Majesty, in anywise, or b any means pardoned, end in this Act hereafter not excepte ! or foreprized."-+ In an ordinary state of public feeling unsparin military execution would not have been considere I justifiable until the attempt had been made to distinguish between the leaders and followers, between those who struck the blow and added outrage to iasubordination, and those whlo pmusively or unwilingly yielded to the movemelit of the body to which they belonged. To this it has been repliel that there otught to have beeea no parleying with rebels, and that the arnmed opposition should have been puit down before the attoinpt wvs mate to discriminate between different degreeg of guilt. Btlt if Mr. Colvin had waited till then it would have been too late. The object was to apply a solvent to reduce the compact mass of rebellion to its ele-nents, and to give to the well-disposed an opportunity of retuining to their allegsance, leaving the guilty remainder to their well-deserved fate. The proclamation was universally approved at Agra. The vast extent of the danger which was opening on us, and the sincere and, thorough delu- Sion which possessed the mass of the Sepoys aboat! the niuewtions of Government were understoodi there. Regiments were beginning to give way all round. To prevent the fatal muischief from spreading, it seemed the wisest thing that could be done to mark that we desired to be just; to offer the means of retreat to those, no' already desperately commaitted, who had been betrayed into the rebel ranks bytheinsane apprehension aboutreligiou, or by the impossibility of separating themselves at the moment from their corps, and to appeal through them to the feelings of the regiments yet in obedience. It seemed to John Colvin and his advisers that this was the right thing to do at that timne and under those circumstances. They ought not to be judged by the event, but by the state of things as it reasonably appeared to them then and there. The new proclamation directed by the Governor-General" remained without effect, just as much as Colvin's did. The crash of regjimep ts advanced so fast that a newidea-that of entire mastery and expulsion of all Europeans from India,seized all minds, and terms of accommodation were no longer listened to. If ever there was a chance of the kind, it was at first, before we were engaged in a war a l'outrance with our whole native ar-my, the gravity of which no one will deny, and John Colvin tried to seize that chance. Colvin earnestly protested against his Proclimation being interpreted as offering pardon to those who had murdered or injured their officers. He urged that the last paragraph limited the first; that the words " that those guilty of heinous crime; against private persons shall be punished," were meant expressly to include crimes against officers as well as other subjects of the Government, as was apparent fronm the sense of the Elindostani word in the original proclamation, which in the Eniglish version was translated "private persons ;" anid that, taken as a whole, the proclamation was identical in substance with a telegraphic message from the Governor-Generalt, bearing the same date as the proclamation, but received subsequently to its being issued. To this the GovernorGeneral replied that, as the proclamation promised liberty to every man who delivered up his arma, unless he was an instigator of disturbance or guilty of heinous crimes against private persons, it threw the burden of proof upon the authority to whom the arms were given up; and every man of the regiments believed to have murdered their officers might, with the proclamation in his hand, claim his disebarge unmolested, unless proof was ready against him individually, which was not possible. Colvin made no rejoinder to the Governor-General, but to his own family he wrote tb;,t, although "the proclamation remained a rmere trifinD inicident in the great series of events," and he would give no further trouble to others on the subject, },e wished his own relatives to understand the arounds of his conduct. "That those," he said, "who had taken a leading or a deliberately maliguant I art in the revolt would ever seek to take advantage * f the notification we knew to be quite out of the question. The chance that seemed open thronLh the proclamation of escape to such persons was M hat called forth the heavy censure at many distant I oints; but we who were nearer the scene, and knew the real spirit of the revolt, could not entertain such a supposition." To this Colvin might have added, if he had lived to complete his defence, that the Governor- General afterwards himself issued a circular letter, in which the principle was fillly admitted that a distinction ought to be made between the innocent and guilty even in Sepoy regimnents which had murdered their officers,: and that punishment ought to be founded upon some proof of individual glult; and the Governor-General's Circu lar was issued onl the 31st of July, when all hope of securing an immediate political result by inducing the comparatively innocent to separate themselves from their more guilty associates had passed away, which was not the case in Afay, when the character of the insurrection had not been fully developed. The difficulty of obtaining evidence must bave been encountered at some time or other, unless it had been determined to make no distinction between the Sepoys belonging to the offending regiineints, whatevertheir individual conduct might have been. Mr. Colvin's active and useful life was now rapidly drawing to a close. A hostile force, composed chiefly of the Neemuch Brigade, arrived within a short march of Agra. The main body of our much smaller force went out to meet them. The entire Christian population of the town and cantonments werntinto thequarters prepared for thema in the old Royal Residence, which had the name, but very little of the character of a fort. On the 25th of August, 1857, there were 4,289 inmates, of whom, including the European regiment and the Artillery, 1,065 were male adult Europeans, 443 Eurasians, and 267 native Christians, and the remaining 2,514 were women and non-adults of the same three classes. As everything had been foreseen and arranged, the bad effects which might have been expected from the compression of this mixed, multitude into a narrow space at the worstseason of the year have not been experienced. But Colvin had received his death-stroke. His governrment, lhe improvement of which was the cherished object of his life, had been reduced to the space commanded bv the guns of the forn, and even this remnant was threatened by a warcloud from the direction of Gwalior. Be must be Yeckoned among the victims of the mutiny bv a sharper and saore protracted agony thau if he had fallen by the sword of the mutineers.§ His first attack of illness immediately preceded the temoval into the fort. Hlis friends frequently and earnestly pressed upon him the necessity for a temporary cessation from work; and as soon as it was safe to do so, they transferred him to the freer air of cantonments, the benefit of which he gratefully acknowledged. His son Elliotil was out mi the district, but near enough to be recalled in time to see and be recognized by his father. ()r .

G C.B., to officers acting under his orders iu Central India it 1821. They were afterwards eirerlated hy Sir Thomas Munro, wlhen he was Governor oE Madras, with an expression of his hope that every public officer would be guided by the spizit of them. Wednesday afternoon, the 9th of September, he sank quietly, without pain, to his last blessed sleep. As rumours had reachei Agra of great desecrationi baving been committed elsewvhere on the remains of Euiopeans, it was considered right to bury him inside the fort, where the funeral took place next morning. The followiing notification was issued on the occasion by the Government of India:- "Fort William, Home Department, Sept. 19. "Notification. "It is the melancholy duty of the Right Honourable the Governor-General in Conncil to announce the death of the flon. John Rnssell Colvin, the Lieutenant-Governior of the Noeth-Western Provinces. "Worn by the unceasing auxicties and 1zbours of his charge, which placed him in the very front of the dangers by which of late India has been threatened, health and strength gave way; and the Governor-General in Council has to deplore with sincere grief the loss of one of the most distinguished among the servants of the East India Comnany. " the death of Mr. Colvin has ocourred at a time wben his ripe experience, his high ability, and his untiring energy would have been more than usually valuable to the state. " But his career did not close before he had won for himself a high reputation in each of the various branches of administration to which he was at different times attached nor until he had been worthbly selected to flU the highest position in Noz.lbern India; and he leaves a name which not friends alone, but all who have been associated with him in the duties of Government, and all who may follow in his path, wiU deligbt to honour. "Tho Right Hon. the Governor-General in Council directs that the flag shall be lowered balf-mast high, and that 17 minute guns sball be fired at the seats of Government in India upon the receipt of the present notification. "By order of the Governor-General of Ind4a. in 0l--n,1 C. BEADON, " Secretaty to the Government of India." It may truly be said that from the time twvenJohn Colvin conimenccd his Indian career at Haileybury, in the first impulse of health dr.d youthful spirits, to that sad hour of gloorm and depression when his remains were enshrined in the last refuge of his shIpvnrecked government, be was incessantly occupied m the vigorous diseharge of the duties of his position. The foundation of his character was laid in the foresight and self-dernial by which the Scotch nation is so honourably distinguished; but to this was addcd a freedom of thought which enabled him to discuss general subjects with the ablest meu of his day, and a love of literature which gave a charm to hia scanty leisure. The warm arad genial qualities of his heart, however,were his crownirng excellence. The infant child of a friend was laid in the burying ground at Calcutta in one of the hottest days of an Indian hot Eeason beside the honoured grave of Frederick Shore. The father wondered to see John Colvin there; but when he expressed his pleasure Colvin only replied, "How was it possible for me to be absent when your child -was buried?" At the most critical period of the discussions relating -to native education the same friend had undertaken to prepare a statement for Lord WViUiam Bentinck, to be the basis of the celebrated resolition of 7th March, 1835, but an attack of fever rendered him incapable of doing it. John Colvin offered his aid, which was gladly accepted; and after two days' hard work Colvin came to his friend's bedside and read the able and effective paper which he had prepared. These instances are mentioned, because they do not invade the privacy of the domestic circle, but it will be understood from them what John Colvin was to his ow-n fairily. Culvin is one of the last of our Indian statesmen who derived their inspiration by immediate tradition from Malcolm, Illunro, Metcalfe, and Bentinek. These wise master-builders completed the edifice of our Indian empire on tbe solid foundations of good faitb, justice, and personal respect. Many of their disciples devoted themselves to the interests of the natives with a self-denying zeal which has been seldom equalled. It would be well to consider how far this tone is maintained by the rising generation of Indian functionaries. Previously to the present outbreak painfnl symptoms were not wanting of the over-confidence arising from habitual success, of the pride which goes before a fall, and especially of a disposit;on to underialue the natives and to be indifferent to their feelings, which alone woould disqualify us for the goveranrent of India. Incredible as it appears, a practice has arisen of late years of designa.ing the natives-not the mutinous Sepoys merely, but the natives geuerally-by the opprobrious name of " niggers" ; and it is evident from the surprise expressed by the natives of India at the personal courtesy with which they are treated on their visits to this country, tbat some great change has taken place in the demeanoar assumed towards them by our countrymen in the East. Tbis is passing strange to thosewho were nourished in the spirit of Sir Johni Malcoltm's instructions to his assistants ;t and it is stranger still to observe that such practices have been s'uffered to growr up writhout rebuke from the Indian Government. I trust that I am labouring under some great delusiou; for if these things are true, and we do not speedily mend our ways, the knell of our Indian empire has sounded; and this insurrection, horrible as it is, will be fol!owed at no distant period by anotber in comuarison with which this will seemn limited and harmless.

THE VIVES AND PA 3ILrES OF SOLDIrBS M.Jr fNDIA. TO TaE EDITOR OF TEE TI3ES. Sir,-In your impression of Wednesday, the 23d inst, there appeared a communication fron Colonel C. B. Phipps to the Secretary of the Woolwich Committee of a Fund for the Relief of the Wives and Families of Soldiers sent on Active Service to India, wherein he states:- " The subscription to wbich you ask Her Majesty to contribute is one raised among the inhabitants of Woolwich, Charlton, aud Plumbtead for the relief of the wvves of the eoldiers of one pirticulsr corps who have been quartered in that neighbouri ood. I am commanded to inform you. In reply, that it would be contrary to establisbed rule for Her majesty to join a local subscription; nor could the Queen con'ribute to the assistance of the wives of one particular portion of the soldiers iE Rer Majesty's service, who are u'fering uader the unavoidab'e separation from their husbands, which has bsen equally borne by the wives of soldiers of other branches of tbe army who may bave beeu quartered throughout the united kingdom. lHer Majesty feels much for the ha.rdships which this separation, necessitated by the xature of the service, must cause to these poor women, and cannot bat feel pleasure at the sympathy and kind assistance which their neighbours are williUg to extend to tbem. T' I have the honour to be, &-c, To Mr. T. Davey." "C. B. Pslirpas. Now, surely, after such a letter, so clearly indicating Her Majesty's feelings and wishes, it only requires the slightest advocacy from your powerful pen to set on foot a general subscription to form a permauent fund for the relief of the wives and families of all soldiers and sailors throughout the united kingdom wbo have been separated from their husbands or nearest relatives in consequence of their being sent on foreign service, wihether t', India or elsewhere. From the little I have had to du with the Indian Ivellef Fund, during the last two months, I know that tho committee felt themselves bound, as trustees of a fund raised specially for the " Relief of sufferers by the Mutiny in India," to refuise aid to very many cases of distress among the wives and families of soldiers both in England and Ireland. Bad as times are there will always be found in Great Britain plenty of money for the support of the wives and families of our gaUlant soldiers and sailors. I am, Sir, your obedient s-rvant TrHOS.
