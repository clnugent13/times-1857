INDIA .-AD CHINA. A portion of the following appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-] By the arrival of the Overland Mail wo have ieceived our private correspondence and letters from Bombay to the 16th of April; Calcutta, the 9th of April; and Hongkong, March 30. THE WAR IN PERSIA. The following letter from our correspondent, dated Bombay, April 16, has been in great measare anticipated by the news we have received direct by way of Constantinople. It is, however, too inter- esting to be omitted:- I " The news from the Persian expedition that I have to send you to-day is of a checkered character. I shall write of a brilliant and successful feat of arms, and of two most melancholy, because suicidal, deaths. The fortified position of the enemy ct Mohammerah has beea captured with Insignificant loss to the victors, but two chiefs of the expedition-a General of Division and the Commodore of the Squadron,-have fallen by their owni hands. General Stalker shot himself in the camp at Bushire on the 14th of March, and three days later Commodore Ethersey put an end to his life by the same means. "Rumourr of the fact and manner of the Generars death had been rife for a day or ttwo in the Bombay bazaars, traceable to the master of a native vessel, who averred that before leaving Bushire he had himself witnessed the funeral, or had heard the discharges of artillery and musketry that attended it, when, on the 8th of this month, the French frigate Sibylle arrived from her cruise in the Gulf, bringing despatches for the Indian Government. Then it appeared that we had to lament the loss, not of the General only, but of another valuable and popular officer. The proceedings of the two Courts of Inquest were made public writhout delay. They go home by this mail, and vilU be read with painful interest by all who desire on the part of British officers, in presence of the enemy, an exhibition not merely of physical but also of moral intrepidity. The verdicts of the Courts are similar in effect, though one is less explicitly worded than the other. The General is found to have destroyed himself ' in a fit of temporary insanity ;' the Commodore ' while suffering under mental aberration, brought about by longcontinued anxiety connected with the duties of his command.' Each officer is assumed to have broken down under the weight, real or imaginary, of his responsibility. In the case of General Stalker this assumption, correct though it may be, is, I think, scarcely borne ont by the evidence. He is proved, it is true, to have been anxious that the troops of his division, the Europeans especially, should bh hutted before the setting in of the hot season, and to have feared that he would be held responsible for any loss from disease that might occur while they were yet under canvass. But on this point he should, before his death, have been made easy by the receipt (acknowledged bY himself) of the copy of a letter addressed to the Chief of the Staff by the Commanding Engineer, in which he, the General, was completely absolved of all blame in the matter. Then, again, he is proved once or twice to have expressed a wish that more cavalry should be left with him, instead of being taken up to Mohammerash; and his aide-de-camp said that he appeared oppressed by a sense of responsibility. But, on the other hand, he is shown to have been on the best possible terms with Sir James Outram, under whom, so far from regretting his supercession, he expressed himself delighted to serve. On the morning of the fatal occurrence he was cheerful aud in good spirits. Shortly after rising he requested his aide-de-camp to load his pistols for him. Captain fHunter did so, and placed the weapons on the table in the General's tent. His chief drcssed and went over to the mess tent to breakfast with Sir James Ontram and Captain Jones, the Resident. After breakfast he wrote down his name in the messbook with that of a guest for dinner. Captain Jones accompanied him to his tent, and sat with him a short time. There was then a weariness about his manner, which the Captain observed, and ascribed to the relaxing effects of the hot wind; but as his friend left the General rose and shook hands with him 'in his usual hearty manner.' Ten minutes later he was a corpse. Such are the facts proved at the inquest, and such the evidence, as far as it bears upon the question of a dread of and a shrinking from responsibility. It should be added, however, that Captain Hunter speals of observing much anxiety on the part of the General, derived from ' causes of a private nature.' " But, if the evidence in proof of mental disturbance is meagre in the case of General Stalker-a man, by the way, of a singularly placid, unimpas sioned temperament-it is abundant in that of Comj modore Ethersey. From entries in his own journal it plainly appears how unequal this unfortunate officer was to the office he fiUed. Two months before his death were such notes as, 'My poor head is sadly confused. I have dreadful attacks at times.' A week before his death he vwrites-' I feel more and more my unfitness to command. I am broken down, my head gone, and the terrible responsibility ! I shall make a mess of it.' (It is the Miohammerah expedition to which he refers here and of which he was to command the naval portion.) In his relations with his superiors at Bombay he saw only a series of rebuffs or insults-in the preparations which he was superin. tending for Mohammerah only the commencement of disgrace and disaster. Sleep failed him at night, or was obtained only with the treacherous assistance of opium. Vhile in this critical condition of mind he heard of the General's death. He writes of the event in his diary thus :-' Heard of poor Stalker's melancholy death. His case is similar to my own. He felt he was unequal to the responsibility imposed upon him. I have had a wretched night.' The fatal contagion of suicide has often been remarked. In this case i' s operation can scarcely be doubted. Before the camp had recovered from the shockl of General Stalker's death Commodore EtherEOY too had shot himself through the head. "CaptainYoung, of theSemiramis, the next senior naval officer present, having been promoted to the command of the squadron,aud thewbole of the trans. ports containing theforce intended for the operations againstMohammerah having been alreadydespatched, the squadron sailed from Bushire on the morning of the 19th of March with Sir James Outram and the head-quarters' staff on board. The rendezvous at the mouth of the Euphrates was reached on the evening of the 21st. Two days were spent in completing arrangements, and on the 24th the whole armsament moved up the Shat-ool-Arab mouth of the river, and anchored about three miles below the point where the Karoon, running from east to west, joins the Euphrates. At that point,which is about two miles below the town of Mohammerah, the Persianz had erected two batteries-one on the north. era or right, the other on the southern or left, bank of the Karoon. Though armed only with 12-pounder and 9-pounder guns, these batteries were very strong, the earthworks being about 18 feet thick at the base, and 10 at the top, and 18 feet high. They were so placed as, in Sir James's words, ' to Sweep the whole stream to the extent of the range of the guns up and down the river, and across to the Opposite shore.' Frather up the Karoon also, on the north bank, was a smaller earthwork mountJX2g tbres guns, placed not less skilfullythanthe !P%ors, Tae wIpay's force wAa ditbuted m tbe camps on the north and wet sides of Mohammeral, one of them resting upon the river. Prince }hanler Mirza held the supreme command, and mustered round his colours, as is supposed, 15,000 men, with 30 guns. Preparations for the attack on this formidable position commenced on the night of the 24th opposite to the northern battery, at about 800 yards' distance. In the main stream of the Eu. phratea was a long low strip of muddy land called Dhubba Iland. Upon this island it had been proposed to erect a mortar battery; but after a careful reeonnoitring of the ground during the night of the 24th it was found necessary to abandon the scheme on account of the depth of the mud, and to substitute for it a floating battery, to be moored on the side of the island furthest from the enemy's battery. A raft was accordingly prepared with all possible rapidity, under the superintendence of Commander Rennie, of the Feroze, and, being armed with two 8-inch and two 5kinch mortars, was towed to its position by a small steamer on the night of the 25th. By this time all had been arranged for an attack the following morning. The vessels of war were to move up at daybreak and engage the batteries in connexion with the mortar raft. lVhen the enemy's fire was silenced, or nearly so, the troops (which had been aU transshipped from the large transports to the smaller ships and steamers) were to be taken up and landed above the northern battery, thus taking the camps and the town of Mohammerah in the rear. At daylight on the 26th the mortars on the raft opened fire, and were immediately replied to from the enemy's batteries. At half-past 6 the steamers got under way, the Semiramis, with the Olive sloop-of-war in tow, leading, then the Ajdaha, the Feroze, the Assaye, andtheVictoria,towing the Falkland sloop. By 7 all were hotly engaged with the batteries. The Persian fire was heavy and weU sustained, but gave way gradually under the overwhelming weight of the broadsides from the ships, delivered, as in some cases they were, at -less than point blank distance, and consisting, of 8-inch shot and sheU and 32 and 24 pounders. In spite of the strength of the enemy's earthworks they crumbled to powder under the storm, and gun after gun ceased firing, til after three-quarters of an hour three or four only of their pieces were at work. Then Commodore Young, thinking the path sufficiently clear, hoisted the signal agreed upon for the advance of the light vessels eontaining the troops. Some little delay occurred at this point, but by half-past 9 o'clock the flotila got under way, and moved up towards the seene of action, the soldiers admiring the vigour and precision of the fire from the ships. As they drew near, a gun upon the south bank of the Karoon opened upon the vessels in succession, striking the Berenice several times, and killing a man on board the Scindian. Just before they came ap with the ships of war several heavy explosions had taken place in the enemy's batteries, which thereupon finally ceased firing, though from their ruins a smart discharge Of musketry was opened and maintained till storming parties from the ships were landed. The troop-vessels were at once pushed up past the now silent northern battery to the place of disembarcation. This was found to be admirably suited for the purpose. There was water enough close alongside to float the largest of the transports. One (the Golden Era) did lie right alongside, and actually slung her horses on to the bank from her deek. The Berenice steamer landed all her menthe 78th Highlander-by means of a plank. Before 2 p.m. aU the force was on shore, and formed for an advance upon the enemy's camp, with the exception of a squadron of Scinde Horse, which had not been ableto land in time, and the troop of Horse ArtiUery, which had got on the wrong side of the numerous creeks that intersect the eountry, and had to wait for the construction of a bridge. There was, however, a troop of Scinde horse, which moved in advance, a field battery, the 64th and 78th, the 20th and 26th Native Infantry, and the Light Battalion. Marching across a fine open plain, the army soon came in sight of the three Persian camps, but no force was drawn out to meet them; indeed, not a man was visible. As they drew nearer it became, to their chagrin, more and more evident that the enemy had " run." And so it proved. The camps were entered, and were found to be deserted. They had been hastily abandoned, the tents all standing, and great quantities of flour and grain and other stores remained, to ease the pressure upon the commissariat of the conquerors. The English General was too weak in cavalry to attempt any serious operation upon the retreating enemy, but he detached Captain Green with a party of Scinde horse, by whom their rear guard was seen retiring in apparent good order, though the road they had traversed was strewn with arms and accoutrements. " The loss sustained by the ships of the Indian navy in this successful and moat creditable achievement is very slight, amoumting to five or six killed and about 20 wounded. Among the latter is Lieutenant Harris, of the Semiramis, but not seriously. Much of the immunity enjoyed is probably due to the wise precaution of placing trusses of pressed hay round and upon the bulwarks of the ships as a protection to the seamen at the guns on the upper deck. None of the steamers, by the bye, carry main deck guns. The loss of the enemy is estimated roughly at 200-mostly smashed by the heavy shaot in the batteries, where I hear the deatruction was complete aud terrible. Sixteen guns (one a fine Russian 12-pounder) and one mortar were captured, and, as I have said above, a number of tents and many stores of various kinds. "The intelligence of the execution of the treaty of peace by Lord Cowley and Feruk bhan reached us on the 6th inst. Only a day before the Madras Fusileers had sailed from the harbour for Bushire, partly on board of and partly towed by a large steamvessel hired from the Peninsular and Oriental Company. Immediately another steamer was sent to fetch them back, and accordingly they returned a day or two afterwards, and have since been sent down the coast to one of the Madras stations there. The 25th Bombay Native Infantry was also overtaken and sent back. All shipment of atores from the arsenal has ceased; but, of course, months must yet elapse before the whole of the army cn be recalled, for we are withlin six weeks of the monsoon, and I suppose thst not a man will be wvithdrawn til it is ascertained that the Persia have evacuated Ierat. " There is nothing of interest to relate from Central Asia or Affghanistanj and accounts from the Punjab are chiefy concerned with the spirited attack by Brigadier Chamberlain upon the Bozdars, of which I wrote in my last. Of the death of Mr. Boileau in Oude more is now known. It appears that the unfortunate gentleman had in his possession the permission to the military authorities to cro3s the Nepaul frontier in quest of Fu7I Ali, but bad not yet promulgated it. Captain Daly and Lieutenant Clarke - respectively of the Oude cavalry and infantry-were, however, out after the robber; and the latter, hearing that he had, with a view to eluding his pursuers, crossed into Nepaul, determined to run the risk of following him, though unauthorized to do so, hoping to be justified by success. He had hardly marched when Mr. Boileau, with five troopers, arrived at his camp, and, learning whither Clarke had gone, accepted an offer to lead him by another route to the robber's haunt. Clarke on approaching the spot heard shots fired, came up hastily, and found that the robber and his men had just gone. He had been auxprised by Boileau, had fired a random shot or two, and fled, not knowing, it is said, till he returned and found the body the next day (for Clarke withd&rw woroa thQ frontier, having failed to dii. cover the corpse) that one of the shots had killed the English Commissioner. " The extension of the electric telegraph from MadrastoCeYlonhas been sanctioned bythe Supreme Government, and its construction is to be commenced 3mmediately. It will run down the coast, intersecting the French territory and having a station at Pondicherry, the whole of the expenses, however, being defrayed by the British, with the sanction of the French authorities. " Here we have little local news to interest you. The hot weather is Betting in-has set in, perhaps; yet, as is often the case in April, it is by no means unpleasant. However, hill stations are generally preferred by those who can get to them. " The money-market is easy. Exchange on London, 2s. 11-mad." IND IA. THE INDIAN ARMY. The following is the letter of our Calcutta correspondent:- ' C&LCUTA, APRIL 9. "The 19th Regiment of Native Infantry has been disbanded. The Government ordered it to march to Barrackpore, the metropolitan cantonment, in order that the punishment might be infficted in the presence of the disaffected. Meanwhile every precaution was adopted to prevent the possibility of resistance. lt was known that the 34th were in league with the 19th. It was suspected that the 2d Grenadiers, if not positively disaffected, were cognizant of the plans and sympathized in the conduct of the mutinous regiment. The two remaining native corps of the brigade were believed to be. faithful, but it is never easy to predict what natives will do when a temptation is placed suddenly before them. It was therefore necessary to provide against an outbreak of 5,000 armed men stationed only 16 miles from a defenceless capital, in a country where two soldiers can disperse a mob. Her Majesty's 84th was hastily brought up from Burmah, and a wing of the 53d was ordered to Barrackpore. The native Bodyguard (cavalry), 500 strong, were despatched in the night, and two troops of artillery with 12 pieces of cannon were broughtfrom Dumdum into the cantonment. Private orders were issuedtothemagistrates to place large bodies of the police uponthe bridges which lead into the town. Finally, orders were issued to Major-General Hearsey, authorizing him to suppress resistance, even if it were necessary to employ the whole force at his disposal, and to destroy three segiments. The Earopeaus waited with a sort of anxious nonchalance for the result, such as AngloIndians can alone display, and amused themselves by circulating the most preposterous rumours. These measures were complete on March 30. Meanwhile a number of circumstances increased the prevailing uneasiness. The Colonel commanding at Dumduni received what appeared to be trustworthy inteUigence that the 19th were marching on the station to seize the artilery. Dumdum is eight miles from Calcutta. He had only 30 men, but he called them together, prepared for defence, and ordered all officers' families to quit the station. They obeyed, and at 2 oclock at night some dozen frightened women were besieging the houses of their friends in Calcutta for rest and sbelter. The same afternoon L;eutenant Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th Native Infantry, was attacked by a drunken or drugged Sepoy at Barrackpore. He was severely wounded, bat the guard refused to arrest the assassin, and the man strutted up aud down til he was seized by the Major-General himself. The transaction looked as if the regiment were resolved to die rather than yield. On the foUowing morning the Europeans were landed, and marched to the parade. The two Queen's Regiments, with the artillery and cavalry, occupied one side, the native regiments the other, and the 19th Native Infantry, wjhich had been halted for the night outside the station, marched into the midst. The Major-General then read aloud the order. " Up to the last moment it was doubtful whether the men would submit or whether a yeU of defiance would compel General Hearsey to open fire. They asked permission to petition. The time, they were told, had passed, and they must lay down their arms. The preparations cowed the men. The old instinctive terror of the Europeans has not passed away, and they laid down their arms, the native officers actuaUy weeping with grief and rage. No humiliation was offered them, they were alowed to retain their uniforms, and were then escorted by the cavalry to Chinsurah. Thence they are gradually dispersing to their homes. "It was believed that this example would have a profound effect. It has certainly confirmed the wavering, but the 34th are more n*tinous than ever. The man who attempted to assassinate Lieutenant Baugh was condemned to death, but, so dangerous was the temper of the men, that General Heansey could not venture to trust them, and the sentence was carried out yesterday under the protection of shotted guns and two European regiments. It may be necessary to mention that the General is a thoroughly able, gallant officer, one of the few Ilindostanee scholars in his rank, and, generally speaking, beloved by the Sepoys. "I fear the 34th alzo must be disbanded. Meanwhile the native regiment at Dinapore is only kept in check by the presence of Her Majesty's 10th. The selected soldiers at the Umballa and Sealkote rile schools complaia that they shaU be outcasts if they use the cartridg', and the Commander-in-Chief's own escort have excommunicated their comrades in the school for touching them. Almost all the regiments of the line sympathize more or less, but, strange to say, al the Irregulars, aU the Sikbs, the Ghoorkas, and all the cavalryridicule the movement.TheSikhs inthe ranks of the 34th are actually leaving the regiment in utter disgust at its conduct. The fact, if the affair becomes more serious, is very important. The line now form only part of the army, and without officers are no match for the Irregulars and Sikhs, to say nothing of the Europeans. "There is little danger, however, of a general disturbance. The Government is perfectly firm and calm; it has decided to make no more concessions, to stop the movement, if possible, without bloodrhed, to restrain the somewhat hasty 'vigour' of its officers, and then, if necessary, to employ force unsparingly. I think, as a matter of opinion, that the affair nmust end in blood somewhere, but I have no fear of a general revolt. One source of danger is the extreme exasperation of the Europeans. A mutiny doubles their duties, and it is not always quite easy to hold them in. " To show yoni the extreme anxiety of Government to avoid offending the religious prejudices of the men I will relate one incident which occurred on the day of the disbanding. Rer Majesty's 84th were landed from the steamer at the Barrackpore Ghaut. Close by the Ghaut is a little temple, outside which the Sepoys put their household deities, ugly little images of wood, stone, earth, or brass. Now, the instinct of a European soldier when he sees an idol is to knock its head off; not from hatred of idols, but love of mischief. GeneralHearseyknew thatany insultof the kind would exasperate the Sepoys to madness. He therefore received the men himself, and the first two soldiers who landed were ordered to stand sentry over the deities. So, on the parade-ground thera were Europeans prepared to put down a mutiny caused by the Sepoys' dread of conversion, and out side the parade-ground there were Europeans keeping guard over the Sepoys' gods. " There is one curious fact in this affair I must not forget. No Mussulmau is conemned in it. A MuNWmtbn dashed ford to gve AdjuiantBaugh3 and had his hand cut through. He was promot on the spot, and will receive the Order of Merit. The Musulmans ganerally are angry in the extreme at the whole proceeding, but they are in the minority. "'Thereis astupidrumour abroad that Government intend to place the native press under a ceusorship. That press, always treasonable, is now especially bitter. It attacks everybody and misrepresents every occurrenee. It is scarcely nGceasary.to say, however, that no restriction will be placed upon it We could not stop lithographed letters from circalating, and a lithograpbed letter is just as effective as a newspaper. The power of this native press, too, is exaggerated; its circulation is very limited and its conductors very lightly regarded. " To turn to pleaaanter topics. A curious little incident has just occurred illustrating the strange medley of races we are called on to govern. There are some hundreds of Santal prisoners in our gaols. They are condemned for the rebellion, but they are otherwise not a bad race, and in gaol they pine for freedom and die like sheep. The mortality in the Bhaugulpore Gaol last year was upwards of 40 per cent. The Lieutenant-Governor was accordingly advised to let them loose, binding them to work in the great swamp province around Calcutta, called the Sunderbunds. They were asked for their parole of honour not to fly, and, after two days hesitation, gave it. Afew days ago it was announced that all had fled. Yesterday, however, they all came, walked gravely up to the Allipore Gaol, and demanded admittance. Not a man had fled. They said the cholera was so bad in the Sunderbundsquite true-that they could not stay, and eso, in obedience to their promise, they had come back to gaol. They will probably be putto otherwork, but their conduct has excited strong sympathy. There is not another race in India who, under the circumstances, would have kept their word. They could have gone home just as easily as to gaol, and all India could not have caught them again. This is the race which has been given to the missionaries. " News has been received of a most successful expedition on the frontier. The Bozdars, a tribe of Beloochees occupying the hills near Peshawur, have been giving trouble. A force of 1,500 men was sent against them. Iu three days it entered their fastness, threaded a pass deemed impregnable, ascended the first range of the Sileimans, stormed all the hill stockades, and reduced a tribe some 15,000 strong to absolute submission. The loss in killed and wounded on our side was about 60. " The mutinies have occupied public attention to the exclusion of every other subject. The reports which come down from beyond the passes are more vague than ever, but I am assured by authority which ought to be reliable that the Persiasm are not advancing on Candalar." CEINA. (FROM OUR OWm CORRESrON.oEST.) BONGKONG, MARCH 30. The steamer Madras, with the 10th of February mails from London, arrivedhere onthe 28th instant. By the steamer Formosa on the 17th instant, from Bombay, we received the semi-monthly advices of the 26th of January. The Peninsular and Oriental Company despatch the steamer Erin to-day for Galle and Bombay, and it is expected that she will reach the former place in time for the despatches by her for England to go on by the Calcutta steamer of the 9th of April. Since writing on the 15th we have little of Importance to communicate. Her Majesty's steamer Sampson came down the Canton River on the 28th instant. The position of our forces in the river remains as before, and we hear of no attempts having lately been made by the Chinese against our ahips or the Teetotum Fort. Admiral Sir Michael Seymour is at present here. This place is quiet, and its security now amply provided for againast any open attack from the Chinese, by the arrival lately of additional men-ofwar steamers and troops. Some of the servants are returning. The com_ pradores have had to pay heavy " squeezes" to the Mandarins. One man had to pay $10,000, others from $1,000 to $5,000. The Inflexible, with the gunboat Starling in company, arrived on the 25th of March. The Zenobia steamer arrived on the 24th inst. She brought on from Singapore eight officers and 415 rank and file of the 12th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, Brevet-Mfajor Cooper commanding. The Barracouta is under orders for home. The Capricieuse and steamera Catinat and Mlarcean are in the harbour. The Virginie is at Macao. On the 19th instant the Hornet, Captain Forsyth, while cruising off St. John's Island, fell in with a fleet of piratical junks. The steamer could not be brought within range of them, owing to there not being sufficient draught of water in thebay where they were. The boats of the steamer pulled in, and Captain Forsyth, observing the position of the junks was a strong one, landed with a party of narines, and reached an eminence, whence, as well as from the boats, an effectual fire was kept up on the junks. After a good deal of firing the pirates took to the hills, and 17 of their boats were taken possession of, which were subsequently destroyed. The only accident that occurred was one man of the Hornet severely burnt by a stinkpot. On board one of the junks were found one European and a Goa Portuguese. They said they had been pressed by the pirates. From Singapore we hear of accidents to two more vessels conveying Coolies from China-the Carmen, a Peruvian, and Henrietta Maria, Dutch. The American ateamer Min was lost on the 22d inst. off Tung-Yung, an island to the northward of Foo-chow, by running on a sunken rock. The mails and passengers were saved, but the vessel and cargo were totally lost. From Shanghai our advices are to the 20th inst., but they do not contain anything of politicalinterest. At Flongklong the following are the quotations for some articles of import:-Cotton, $9to$10i cotton yarn, Nos. 16-24, $26; Nos. 28-32, $34; Nos. 38-42, $40 to $42.

Foo-chow dates are to the 23d instant. Nangchow Congous were sold at to. 29 30, short price, and the teamen were expecting higher rates. From Amoy our adviqcs are to the 23d inatant There had been small sal of imports. At Shanghai there had been little doing in imports. 6j catties gray longcloths were quoted 1.6.5 Shanghai taels. In exports a large business had been done. Of silk 3,000 bales setted. The total quantity arrived was 80,000, of which 77,000 bales were settled.

Those articles, however, which are not much affected by the advanco in freight5 havo continued in brisk inquiry, more especialy as our exchange has assumed a downward tendency. Very little has been done in indigo, of which the greater portion of the past season's crop has alredy been exported. An excellent, though not general, demand haa prevailed for sugar at en. hanced prices. A good basiness has been done in saltpetre, and the market closes firmly. Raw silk continues in great favour, but the extraordinary high figures paid for the article render buyers less saguine. In corahs nothing has been done.

At this time of the year the market generally remains in a languid state, nor has the present seaeon been an exception. The aroaching termination of the native now year, tho in- erent zvicee from the marts in the upper provinces, and the accumulation of many descriptions of cloths, have allcombinedto restfict operaions, although facilities are greater owing to the improved state of the money-market. Under such circumstaCOS we have bat a very moderate amount of transactions to report. Metals, bowever, have attracted greater attention, and under the influence of a botter demand a firmbea has been imparted to the market, and in many instances pricee have taken an upward tendency. Money Market.-The improvement noticed in our last continues unchecked, and confidence is gradnually gaining ground. On Thursday last the Directors of the Bank of Iingal reduced their rates of interest and discount one per cent, all round.

The gallows wa erected in the oentre of the parade-round, and the troops were drawn up so as to form three sides of a squar, coterminously. he 70th Regiment Nativo Infantry, the 34th Native Infantry, the 43d Native Infantry, and the 2d Grcnadiers formed into separate squares on one side, faced bv the Governor-General's body guard and Her Majesty's 53d4legi. ment in line; on the third side were drawn out Her M jesty's 84th Regiment, also in line, flanked by two l ht horse batteries of the East India Company's Artillery. The culrit ws carried on to the ground, accompanied by a d- tament of the guard, when the fonr first-named detachments were marched up in front of the gallows.

THE NAPIERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am rather surprised to find in your journal a letter from Colonel Wood to me published without my answer. You will feel it to be but fair that I ask for the insertion of the whole correspondence, which I must say I did not think Colonel Wood would have thrown upon me for publication. The following is what he calls my acknowledgment:- "Scinde House, May 8, 1857. "Sir,-Being without personal knowledge of the parti. culus of the first Sikh war, beyond what newspapers and offlcers' publications have furnished, I cannot pretend to discuss the questions mooted by you. I have merely set down from my brother's journal what his vews were. Very possibly he may havo been misinformed on some points, and itis for those who know better to point out errors; but you will observe that he gives many facts as reports, and says expressy that there were two stories. " His animadversions, political and military, must go for what they are worth, and subject to antagonistic criti. cism. " Your statement of the force under Littler means, I pre. sume, the number on paper, and also I suppose the garrison left in Ferozepoor, because all published aCCounts that I have seen give him but 6,000 on the field of battle. " As to the absence of treachery among the Sikhs, that also is in direct o pposit5on to all published accounts of ihe war and to all reports of the war. However, I have no means of giving a well-founded opinion on this head, and do not offer any positive assertions as to special points. " But on the general vilw I mnst oppoese you so far as to think the number of troops engaged at Moodkee and Feroshashur, the scarcity of ammunition during the eampaign, and the necessity of detaching Harry Smith, &o., do not- the great force of the Indian armies and great resourcs. of the Indian Government considered-indicate sufficient pre. paration for a war so long expected, and so formidable There are two ways of summing up a campaign. "If my memor be amcurate, I think Lord Gough's de. spatch said the enemy first opened a cannonade on the British camp at Mloodkee, and that the advance of two miles was made after that. "C Lord Ellenborough assured me that the bridge equipage at Ferozepore ws his doing. " With this avowal of my inability to discuss the eampaign in detail, I must leave my brother's statements to take their chance, simply remarking that, being called upon, as he was, to take command, it is probable that he was not much misinformedL "I remain. Sir. vour obedient srn-t " W. NAPIER. Lis3atenst6a.^nrrst *Colonel and Adjutant-General Wood, c" "Royal Hospital, Du)blin, May iL "Sir-Iam obliged to you for your letter of the 8tb. You ae corzect in presuming that the force stated by meto have been stationed atFerozepore was the number on paper. The returns show these to have been 10,472, and the force SirJohnLittler brought to Ferozeshuhur on the 21stwasnot more than half that number, but so ably did he effect thi movement that at 12 o'clock on that day the men at the advanced posts of his own army wero not aware that he had leftFerozepore for the purpose of joiningthe Commanderin. Chief. "It was, as you state, Lord Bllenborough who ordered the boats to be prepared at Bombay on which we crossed the Sutlej, bat he had left India before they were completed. " I have not by me a oopy of Lord Gough's despatch oza tho Battle of Moodkee,bat I was close to his Lordship when the firt shot was fired by the Sikhs; it struck the ground and bouinded over his Lordship's horse; we were at that time some distance in advance of where our videttes had lboen posted, " I nnd, on looking at my letter to you of the 7th, that there is a clerical error in the number of miles the British army is stated to have advanced; it should have been 200, not 250, Lord Gough's head-quarters havinr been at Um. ballaha when the first Sikh war broke out. With this slight alteration I conclude that you will not object to my publish. ing that letter, as you say ' very possibly he (Sir Charles Napier) may have been misinformed on some points, and it E for those who know better to point out errors.' "I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant, "B. B. WOOD, ColoneL "1eutenant-General S ir William Napier, KC.B." " Scinde House, May 12. "Sir,-I am glad to find that my surmises were correct on the points I alluded to in my letter. "I caunot possibly ha ve any objection to your making the correotion you propose in your own letter. I presame you mean to publish my answer, from your notice of a particular passage. "I remain, with thanks for the explanation you hay0 afforded, "Your obedient servant, ' W. NAPIER. "Colonel Wood, C.B., Depaty.Adjutant General!. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Do I understand Colonel Wood to say, or mean; that " due preparation wtas made by the Governor-General of India to meet the contingency of a war with the Sikhs P' If so, how was it that the Commissariat arrgements were not even in progress on the 13th of December, 1845the date of the proclamation ' At the trial of the contractor, Lallal JooteepersMkd, in Agra (1851), Major-General Parsons, the Commissary. General, was asked by the Lallah's counsel,- " How camo there to be such delay and confudion in pro. viding stores and food for the army ' "Because the Governor-General never expected the Sikhs would cross the .riiier (Sutlej). His Lordship told me this on the 13th of December," was General Patsotys reply. But, Sir, let us refer to the proclamation of the kte Lord Hardinge, dated the 13th of December. We ahall find the following page. It does not support Colonel Weods view of the case:- " The Govermor-Gener.l in Council sinoerely deiired to see a strong Sikh Government reestablished in the Punjib, able to control its army, and to protect its subject. Hed not up to the present moment abandoned the hooe of seeing that important object effected by the patriotic efforts of the chiefs and people of that oountry." It struclk me, on reading the blue-books, that Lord IIar dinge's " apology" for so dissatrous, bloody, and expenaive a war was grounded on the fact that his lordship Was " noW prepared for it." However, according to Colonel Wood's defence of his late uncle, it would seem that } in Common with all India, was greatly mistaken. At a moment's notice the lower and middle provinces of India were stripped of their troops and left utterly defence. less. Staff offioers, old and young, were withdrawn frots eivil employ and hurried to the scene of action. All ws disorder, confusion, and panic. This, I am now given to understand, was the result of "due preparation." I have no desire to meddle with this eontroversy, which in no way concerns me; but I tink it only due to the public, to the memory of the lAte Sir Charles Napier, to Lord Gough, and to the reputltion and veracity of the late Lord Hardinge, that Colonel'Wood's letter abbould not go unrefoted. I have the lionour to be, Sir, Your obedient servAnt. Pflioiox' .WA%IwawAgzj aka.T io,
PARLIARENTARY INTELLIGENCE S - L- R D- , 1 HOUSE OF LORDS, MONDY, IffA 18. The LoRD-C5IANCmOR took his seat on the woolmuek at A o'clock. Lord WiLLom GESy de BRoKE appeared at the table and took the oaths. Lord CABPBELL presented a petition from the inhabit-nts of Bombay, complainig of the administration of justico by the civil servants of the Eadt Lndia Company, and rayag thet a supreme court might be e tablished at Bombay, to be composed of English lawyers, together with certain members to be appointed by the Governor.General In Council. ST. JAMES'S PA-REK The Earl of lALMESBURY rose to ask a question relative to the alterations novw being made in St. Jame'es Park. Their lordships wonuld remember that on Friday night hi, noble friend the President of the Council founded his statement of the reasons for these alterations principally, if not entirely, upon sanitary grounds. He would like to know, therefore, whether the ioble earl would have any objection to produce any correspondence which might have taken place with the Board of Health within the last few geara in regard to the sanitary condition of St. James's Mark, or any official document issued by that board recommending the works now in progress. If Sir B. Hall had tbe authority of the Board of Health formakingthealterations in tho parkhemight stand partially excused for enteringinto them without the consent of Parliament; but, at the same time, such authority would form no reasoh for paying the expense out of the public purse. As the sanitary laws at resent stood works similar to those now going on in St. James's Park were executed throngbout England at the expense of the loel proprietorm. In Salsbury the cost of certain sanitary improvements amounted to a sum equal to two-thirds of one year's rental, and in other places the burden had fallen very beavily upon tine owners of properiy. He did not wish to go into any argument about the amusement of the people and the adornment of the public parke. It was childish to imagine that he was not as much in favour of these tbings as anybody else; bat he wanted to see such improvements as those in St. James's Park placed upon a proper footing, and if, as his noble friend the President of the Concil was reported-no doubt correctly-in 2'he Times to have stateds the alterations were necesaary upon sanitary grounies, he thoughtthat London ought to bear the expense, and not the public purse. Besides the correspondence with the Board of Health, to which he had already referred, he wished to knorw whether the noble earl would produce any con,miunications which, in the absence of authority from Parliament to execute the works in St. James's Park,might have passed between Sir Benjamin Hall and the Treasury, in orer that their lordships might ascertain whether the Chief Commissioner obtained the sanction of the Treasury to his proceedings. Earl GRANVILLE did not think that he put the necessity for the alterations in St. James's Park so exclusively upon sanitary grounds as the noble earl seemed to suppose. He admitted, however, having stated on Friday evening that, owing to the dirty state of the water in the Park, containing as it did a great deal of off,n6ive matter, it was thought desirable to make some improvements. The present Chief Commissoner of Works formerly beld the offics of President of the Board of Health, and in that capacity had become perfectly acquasinted with the unwholesome condition of the lake in St. James's Park. No ob3ection could exist to the production of the documents asked for by the noble earl. He might take that opportunity of stating, as his nobleafriend wished to enforce economy in theta matters, that there would in future be a arving of ilOOf. n-year upon the supply of water alone. The Earl of MALMESBURY hoped the noble earl would favour their lordabips with the details of that anticipatedsaving. Ie knew what the noble earl meant, but thought he bhould be able to show that the balance would be the other way. (A laugh.) The Earl of EGLINGTOUN inquired whether the Serpentine was to be put through the same process as the lake in St. James's Park. Earl GRANVILLE could not answer the question. As au individual, he hoped it might. (Hear, hear.) MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCESS ROYAL, The LORD CHANCELLOR read the following Message Vrom the Queen:- " Her Majesty having agreed to a marriage proposed between the Princess Royal and Eas Royal Bighlsss Prince Frederick William of Prussia, hasthoughtfitto communicate thesame totheoouseof Commons. Her Majestyisfullypersuaded that this aliance cannot but be acceptable to all Her Majesty's faithful sabjects. The many proofs which the Queen has received of the affectionate attachment of this House to Her Majesty's person and family leave her no room to doubt of the concurrence and assistance of this House in enabling her to make such a provision for her eldest daughter with a view to the said marriage as may ba suitable to the dignity of the Crown and the honour of the country." Earl GRANVILLE then rose and sid,-I rise for the - purpose of requesting your lordships to agree to a motion -which I believe, under present circumstances, you will not be disposed to deal with otherwise than in the most loyal manner. Many of your lordships are acquainted with the way in which her Royal Highness the Princess Royal has fulfiMed the expectations which it was natural to entertain from the education and example she has received (hear, bear); and some must know Ithat the character, opinions, and feelings of the Prince whom her Royal Highness is to mnarry are such as to lead to even more than the usal hopes of happiness from the proposed union. (Cheers.) Your lordships, I am sure, must desire to testify by a loyal and dutiful Address the anxiety which you feelto promote in every way the comforb and happiness of the parents of the Princess Royal, and to express your admiration of the manner in which their domestic duties have been discharged, and of the care and attention which they have shown in the education of their children. (Cheers.) Without troubling your lordships with any further remarks, I beg to move that the following Address be presented to Her Majesty:- "That an humble Address be presented to Ier Majesty, to return to Her Majesty the thanks of this House for her most gracious communication of the intended marriage between the Princess Royal and his Royal Eighness Prince , Frederick William of Prussia, to express their satisfaction at the prospect of an alliance with a Prince of so illustrioas a family, which they doubt not will contribute to the happiness of Her Majesty and of her Royal Highness, as well as prove conducive to the best interests of this kingdom; and to assure Her Majesty that the House will immediately proceed to the consideration of Her Majesty's gracious mes. sage in such a manner as shall demonstrate the seal, duty, and affectionate attachment of this House to Her Majesty, a just sense of the merits of her Royal Highness, and a due regard to the dignity of the Royal Family and the honour of this country." The Earl of DERBY.-I am sure your lordships will unanimously agrce to the address which has just been moved by my noble friend opposite. (Hear.) As I understand him, the message, as far as regards the details In connexion with that marriage, will be taken into consideration on a future day. We are now asked to express our loyalty, attachment, and affection to Her Majesty and the satisfaction that the proposed marriage wiU contribute to her happiness and that of the Royal Family, which I am sure is felt, not only by every member of your lordships' EHouse, but by every member of the community. (Cheers.) Unlike ordinary Royal marriages, Her Majesty's was one not tounded on considerations of policy alone, but on personal acquaintance and attachment. (ERear.) I hope and believe the same remark may be applied to that marriage to which your lordships are nskedtoassent; and Iam quite sure your lordships can express no better wish for the future happiness and wel. faze of the Princess whose marriage is about to be celebrated than that, as she enters upon married life under similar auspices, so in the course of it her happiness may be as completo and well merited as that of her illastrious mother. (Cheers.) I have great satisfaotion in conocrring in the address. The motion was agreed to. - PROrtATES AND LE[TERS OF ADM[NIS. TRATION BILL. The LORD-CHANCELLOR, in moving the second read. lIg of the Bill, said it wasonly a few weeks or a few months .,,nt most since he had the honour of drawing their lordships' attention to the sabject of testameatary jurisdiction. He had occasion then to go somewhat at length into the quesT tion, and therefore he should now merely point out the ovils which itwas proposed to remedy, and the enactments by which he trsted the remedy would be acoomplished. Their lordships were probably aware that it was a subject -which had engaged the attontion of the Parliament and the *country for considerably more than a quarter of a century. .Iis noble and learned friend (Lo d Lyndhurst) issued two commisiona-theEcclesiasticalCommisdonandtheRenlPro.- portyConusission. The3cclesiaaticalComrssion wasdirected to eminent judges and divines the Real property Commnis. sion to eminent lawyers, prcsided over by the present Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Qunen's Bench, and their attention Wa caled to the unastisfactory state of the law in matters testamentary. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners pointed out the enormous inconvenience which resalted from time great multitude of smaUl jurisdictions, having authority only -within very narrow limits, and recommended the eweeping away all smallerjurisdictions and concentrating the jurisdiction in the two Prerogative Courts of Can- t-erbury and York. The Real Property Commissioners took n different view. They thought that the non-contentious jurisdiction should remain in one office instead of being dispersed over a great ptumber, and that the coatentious jurisdiction should be referred to the Court of Chancery. Tho3e reports came out in 1832 and 1833, and it might be asked why nothing had been done? More engrossing and important subjects-the Reform Bill, the Poor LarBill, the Tithe Commutation Bill, the Municipal Reform Billzendered it imposible effectually to introduce a measuze at the same time upon the not less difficult subject of testamentary jurisdiction, Two er thre9 Bils wore introduced V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ in 1835 and 1837, one by his nobie ana learned friend (Lord Lynadhurst), another by Lord Cotteaham, and another by the Present Lord Chief Baron Pollack, thea AttorneyGveneral, but they were merely liddoth tabe orcon. 6ideration. In 1843 an atweapt was made to put an ead to these annual discussions by his noble and learned friend (Lord Lyadhurat) introducing a measure upoa the subjec; nhat Bill never became law. lai the following sessionx a; Bill, not exactly the samne, but foundedl on the same princiPles, was introduced by Sir J. Nichol, then Judge-Advo cate. That Bill did not pass throutgh the other House. In 1845 Lord Cottenham, who dlid not then hold the great I Sea, introduced a measure of his own, which went to rthe House of Commons, but which went no farther. In 184, and duringthe time Lord Cottenhamn held the Great Seal, the reform of testamentary jurisdiction was not attempted. In 1850 Lord Traro issued a commission to disftiguished lawyers to inquire into the state of the Court of chancery. In 1852, when Lord St. Leonard's received the Great Seal he added the names of several persons intimately connected and familiar with the practice and proceedisigs of the ecclesiastical courts-W.- Luashington, Sir Jobn Dodson, the Queen's Advocate, and Mr. Ilolt- and the commissioners were directed to look into this question specifically. They made their report in January, 184, andI what they recommendedl wss the establishing of a Queen's Court of Probate, that shouald have jurisdiction, over the whole kingdom. TUhey also reCommended that these should be distinct courts throughout the country, numbering from 24 to 80 ; that the probate courts ehould have the exclusive power of granting probate, both of real and personal estate; thlat the Accountant General of the court should he the Accountanlt-Genera of the Court of Chancery; and that there should be an appeal to the Court- of Chancery, and from the CourtofOChancery to the House of Lords, or direct to the House of Lords. He thought it his duty to submit a Bill, framed to embrace those recommnendations, seen after the commissioners had made their report. The Bill received great consideration in a select committee, and on the suggestion of Lord St. Leonard% all the previsions connected with real estate were struck out, and the Bill made to apply to Personal estate only. The Bill went down to the other House, but shared the fate oi others which had preceded it, Another Bill was introduced into the House of Commons in 1855, which adopted part of the machinery of the Bill which went down from this House, The commissioners, it would be remembered, recommnended that the Court of Probate should be connected with the Court of Chancery, hut it a.ppeared while the matter 'was under consideration great difference of opinion arose as to whether Parlament ought or ought not to adopt the recommendations of the Real Property Corn. misisioners, and make the contentious business the business to be transact-ed by the Court of Chancery. In faVOur Of that course it was argued that the Court oDf Chancery being the court whose province it was to construe the meaning of the language used in the gret bulk of wills, it was extremely convenient that the sameo court should also be the court to decide whether the document did or did not constitute the will. The Commissioners, however, did not recommend that course. There were three dissentients, and they thought the proper course would be to make it an integral part of the urt of Chancery. In his (the Lord Chancellor's) Bill of 1854 be had taken the Mvew of the dissentients, and though he had sinco receded from that view, he could not say that the dissentient minority in that commission had not the greater weight of argument on th eirside, He found that was a course distasteful to the other House of Parliament and the country generally, nan that it would be hopelees to connect this Court of Probate with the Court of Chancery, however desirable same might think such a connexiont to be. A Bill was introdluced in 185, and again in 1856, int-o the House of Commons by his learned friend the Attorney-General. The Bil of 1856 was not founded upon the notion that the Court of Probate should be part of the Court of Chancery, but it gave to the new Court of Probate the functions of the Court of Chancery in the interpretation and construction of wills,. That Bill, however, did not pas the House of Commnons, and consequently he thought the best course would be to intro-O duce a Bill again into their lordships' House free from what appeared to ba the vice of the formerBilL, In the last session of Parliamnent, therefore, he introduced a BUIl in whichL his object was to dissever this new court altogether from the Court of Chancery ; bat he thought it would be better to make one of the Viee-Chancellors the judge of the new court, and the Bil contained a. revision for carring oumt that suggestion, After the Bill had been read a secondI timne he went through it again, in order the more completely to dissever the new court from the Court of Chancery, but the dissolution taking place about that tim nothing- more was dane with that Bill, and', with the clo'se of the Parliament, it fell, with all other BUils then before Parliament, to the ground. It therefore became his duty to reintreduce the mieasure, which, on his motion, their lordships read a first time las;t week, and which he should now as-k them to read a second time, In the present Bill he proposed that the present judge of the Preroative courtt shoula be the first judge of the new Court of Probate. The learned judge of that court was now paid by fees~, which was the most objectionable mnode of remunerating any judge for his services. He (the Lord Chancellor) therefore proposed, by the Bill now under consideration, to give the judge of the new Court of Probate a saary of 4.000OL, which was about the amount he now received%by fees. That was also the salaty of the Judge of the Court of Admiralty, and as that judge would receive a retiring allowance of 2,000OL a-year, he (the Lord Chancellor) proposed to award the judge of the new Court of Probate a retiring allowance of thle same amout, There wouLld be in his (the Lord Chancoellor's) opinion bu llttle work for such a judlge to do, inasmuch as disputed matt-ers of fact would have t be determined by juries. The mOst satisfatctory course wouldI be to have such matters in dispute brought under the cognizance of juries in the common la-w courts, and such an arrangement as that would necessarily leave the duties of the judge of the new court extremely small. Indeedl, he had thought at one time that no judge would be necessay, but having had the sugestion forced upon him as it were that the judge of the proroaieCourt shouald be the judge of the new couxt, he matto propose that the same judge should also be~ the judge of the Matrimonial and Divorce Court. He proposed also that the cours of proceeding ia the court should be altogether altered. He proposedi that the whole should be done by vivd voce evideonce, just as it was or might be done in the Court of Chancery, Of course, each person might state his case, if hie chose to do so, by affidlav-it, but subject to an examination vivdt voce by any person interested, He did not feel that he should be justified in concealing from their lordships his belief that the new court, even with the addition of the niatri. menial and divorce business, would not be adequately employed. Twenty years ago a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to look into this subject, and his right hon. fInend the present judge of thle Admiralty Court then gave it as his opinion before that committee that the whole Admiralty, testamentary, and mnatrimonial business might be perfectly ell discharged by use judge. (Hear, hear.) He (the Lrd Chancellor) did not think that the lapse of 20 years had produced such a change in any department of that business as to render that opinion of his right hon. friend Dr. Lushington inapplicable to the present day. On that point, however, he had thought fit to consult Dr. Lushington, and his right hon. friend had told him that, though independently of the war, which wan now at an end, the business of the Admiralty Court had increased materially, it was still his opinion that the evidence he gave 20 years ago might he repeated now, and that the seine judge might well discharge all the duties--Admniralty, matrimonial, and probate. (Hear, hear.) He (the Lord Chancellor), however, did not on that point rely AlOn on the opinion of his right hon. friend Dr. Lushington, but there was one circumstance which Lsured him of the accuracy of that opinion. There was but one chamber in Doctore'-commons in which the business of all the courts there-namely, the Admiralty, the Arches, the Prerogative, anid the Consistory-was transacted, and that court was found ample enough for the sittings of them alL. They dlid net altogether, in facot, sit miore days than the Court of Chancery, if so mnany. Taking that fact in connexion with what was stated to him, as the result of the experience of so eminent a judge as Dr. Lushington, he thought he was justified in stating that the great probability was that one judge would be sufficient to di-charge all the duties of the new court, (Hear, hear.) He also proposed that on any vacancy occuring in the office of judg of the Court of Admiralty it should be lawful for the Quaeen to appoint the judge of the Probate Court to be also the judge of the Court of Admiralty. When the office of judge of the Admiralty CouLrt, who was now also judge of the Consistory Court, was abolished, it was reasonable, be thought, that the judge of. the Court of Probate should be placed upon the same footing as to salary with the judges in Westminster-hall, and should receive 5,O000.a-year. He proposed, then, that in the first instancoe the present judge of the prerogative Court should be the judge of the Couart of Probate, and that power should be given to Her Majesty, 'when that office becarae vacant, to appoint the judge of the Court of Admiralty to be jutdge of the Court of Pr-,bate, such judge being then placed on an, eqkuality with regard to salary with the juLdges at Westmninster. He proposed, as he had already stated, that evidr,ace should he taken in the new court vivd roce, that the rMes of evidence adoPted in the comnmonlaw courts should be actedl upont in the Probate Court, and that all questions of di'puted facts should be tried by ajury, unlessthe parties to the proceedings wished otherwise. He Proposed that to this court all contentions questions9 of probate should be referred, whether they related to the sanity of testators to t'he revocation of wills, or to their due executtion, There mnight, however, be cases where thle prprtya of very small 'value, which might reasonably ber,eft, tyowthes decisior4 of the Counuty Court judges Y. Hewol _ _-m,~, +i,. Where property was sworn under 2001. or realty, the judges of County Courts should be entitled to try questions as to whether the testators were of sane mind, and whether the wills had been duly executed; and that the finding of such judges should be conclusive, They had still to consider, however, what course should be taken witb regard to probates of wills of persons in the country, which, though not relating to very small amounts, did not deal with considerable property. At present, if all the property of a person was in a particular diocess-for instance, thai of Lincoln or Norwich-it was only necessary to prove the will in that diocess whatever might be the amount of the testator's property; but if he held property to the value of 6f out of that particular diocess the probate was altogether void. That anomaly he (the Lord Chancellor) proposed to remedy, and to provide a means of enabling persons to prove wills which did not involve very large amounts in the various dioceses. With this object he epropoed the establishment of districts. The last commission recom. mended the formation of 30 disticts, but when the subject wans considered in 1856 perisons vho were acquainted with the requirements of the various localities recommended that 36 or 37 districts ehould be established, and upon that suggestion he had acted, taking care that the districts should, as fur as was practicable, coincide withthe existing diocesan districts. Of course, for this purpose the registran would be the officevr of the Court of Probate, and not, of the eoolesiastical courts. He did not propose, however, that, these disict registrars should possess any contentious jriadictin whteve, forit ws im osie that they could exectise suh jurXisdoictiion satisifac-tortily. They wereM noti rittondd by ay bar ad, atoghna ftem ihtb gentlemen who were competen to decide eont.st.d.legal OXfces He proposed, therefor, that the registrars shouldl have power to grant probate only in cases where there was 110 contlest, and also only when it was swornx that the testators died within tho limnits Of the disatsit, and thiat their property'was below the value of l,fOOf. Under the eisti, sytm sh ad said, if a wil; was proved In ai Outof hat005. ad the testator possessd jiroperty I~ ~ doceassuch probate was absolut Y void. Was ay proertyin a particular dioceas, and, nevrthles, te wllwas proved in the Prerogative Coim', suc wil ws nt a~oltel vod, but was voidable. This seeme to un aver amlos satite of things, and he therfor prooSe tat any persons who chose mightprove wils i th Lodoncourt, whether the testators died in tho country or not. He also proposed that every month there should be remitted to the London court from each of the Provincial districts a list of all the wills proved in such districts, together with 'a copy of each will, which should be kept under proper direction in the Probate Court of London, so that, any person might at any time see a copy of the orgnlwill wherever it had beeni proved. It was most imprtnt with reference to the transfer of property, that pe'rsons should be ena'bled to ascertain to what charged it wvas liable, and if a person died who possessd property which was dispersed over different districts it might he necessary to institute a search in numerous places-a pro. ceeding attended with oonsifderable inconvenience and expue Hefurther proposed, in compliance with what be fondto He a' very general feeling, that the original vwill should be left in the respective districts, and thats copies only should be transmitted to London. He did not pro. p~ose, however, that copies of the wills proved in L-ondon shuld be sent to the provincial districts, but he -would pro. vide that at certain stated periods lists of all thewills prov, d in London, with the names of the testators, the execators, and such other particulars as experience might suggest, should be printed, wvith proper indexes, and transmitted tso all the district registrars, and to certain placs where they inight be conveniently consulted. The consequence would be that in London persons mnight see copies of all the wills wbich had been proved an-ywhere in the country, and in the districts they could see al the wills proved in each district, and lists of those which had been proved elsewhere. This arrangement wvould, he thought, affordi as great facilities f or consulting wills as the public could require. The Bill would contain another provision -which, although not precisely germane to the question of proving ills, would, he believed, be found of great advantage. It frequently happiened that upon a person's death his surviving relatives did not know -where to look for his will. It mig'ht not he discovered among his papers; lie mnight have changed his solicitor , andi muchx difficulty often resulted from this uncertainty. fie (the Lord Chancellorl proposed that at the Probate Office in London there should be adepartument in which all persons who thought fit to do so might deposit their wills, so that at their deaths their surviving relatives imight have no difficulty in knowing whereoto find them. Be would not refer to some other do. tails of the measure, which maight be more conveniently considered in committee, hut he mnight observe that a roms. plaint had been made thatin the first measure hehadbroughit forward on this subject he had proposed that probate should be extended to real as well as to persondl estates, It was true that, in conformity with the recommendation of the commissoners, he had made isuch a proposal in theB ill of 1854, and that proposal was discussed most ably and at very great length in the select committee to which the maeasure was referred by* their lordships. He then stated that he was satisfied the recommendation of tshe comyinsasoners wouldl be rather injurious than beneficial. It might be sad, "1It you have probate as to persenal estate, why not require probate for real estate ?I hit there were substantial--not technical--diffi-culties in the way. With regard to personal estate, they wanted some one to represent the testator in person, some one who wa8 ea. titledl to sue for and recover all that the testator, had be been alive, might have sued for and recovered. Personal property was, so to speakr, infinite ; it -was personalty alI oi;er the world; and the Inconvenience would be very peat if there was not a person to stand lin the shoes of the deceased. The same necessity, however, did not exist with regard to real estate. A, great rich mniUfionsiair-c might have half a-dozen real estates, but that was an exceptional case, most persorsa having only one or two real estates; and there was no difficulty in the persons to whom real estates devolved enter. ing on the possession without the instrumentality of any third person at all. It was tmue that by recent leggislaticni real estate, after the exhaustion of the personal estate, weoa mnade subject to the payment of debts ; but that was not on ordinary condition of real estates j and to impose on tie0 devise of a real estate the necessty of having it alwa3 a roe,frtesake of an iV r symmetry, would, he terived, fo he imns sunnecssar burden. (Hear, hear.) Therefore=tePrsn_tmeasure, lihie the previous one, did not propose any enactment of tha's sort. TXhere ha;d been cases, however, though not certainly of frequent occurrence, which had presenxted an anoma'y revolting to the minds of those who looked at this subjett theoreficAlly. Suppoing the court which had to decide cn the validity of wipllsdecided that a will was good becasu,e the t-estator was sane, tho heir.at-law might still dispule that the testator was sane and determine to bring an elet. ments to roecover the real estate. That was a cours which he might pursue, and there were casesin which this anomaly had occurred, that the very same instrument had been, in a dispute respecting the personal estate, decidled to be the Instrument of a sane pesn, and,min a dispute respecting the rea estate, had been decided tsobs the instrejmentof anlnsase person. It appeared to him that, without making proba# e necessaryforreal estate, this evil might be met by atprovisien he opoeditheBil ofladseision, and whicli herenewcd test about the validity ot?-.%ll, on the ground that the testator was insane, or that the will had not been executed with due formality, that the Court should cite not only those who were interested in contesting the validity of the will as to personal estate, but likewise those interested in the real estate, so that that which was substantially tbe same question as to both should be decided once for all. He was aware tha~t in miaking this provision he should encounter the opposition of 'a noble and learned lord not now present,-Lord St. Leonards, who thought that the evil of connecting probate with real estate wovLld more than counter. balance the advantage. On that point it was for their lord. ships to decide. The Bill was so framed that the provision was not essentia to it, but he could no's but think that it would be a blot on the legislation of the counr if they did not remove an anomaly which was so easily remedied. TheTe was another minor provi. Bion which he was desirous of explaining to their lordship,s. A's presnt, whenever it was necesary to p rove a devise in tKe common law courts or the Chancery Courts, the original will must be produced. This was often an expensive Proceeding and was frequently only a matter of forma; and heproposed that whenever a lawsuit wastgoing on in which it was necessary to give evidence of th devise of the real estate, notice might be given by one party to the other aide that he meant to rely on the probate, and that that should be sm4 ado evidence of the devise, unles, n th otr hand notice should be given that the original Will must be produced. In such case it should he in the discretion of the judge to decide which party should bear the costs for the production of the original will. He thought that this would be a useful modificationi of the present laiw. He had proposed in the BUIl of last session that the appeal from the decisons of the Court of Probate should he to the Lords Justices of Appeal, or per MciU= to their lordehips' house ; but, in deference to the feeling that that would prove a costly proceeding, he now proposed that the appeal should be to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Counoil.IHe confessed be thought the other cours the best, but he made the alteration, as it ap. pearetht no proposition connected in word or name withi the C our of Caucey would have any hance of success. As several perons would necessarily b deprived of office under the present Bill he pro sed that they should be compensated, unles they shuld be appointed to corresponding offices under the new arrangement. (Hear, hear.) All these reformis were to a certain extent costly as to compensation, but he believed that, on the whole, the granting of compensation was just and expedient, for there was a strong feeln agapinst making reforms at the expense of individLuals, (Hear, hear.) Their lordships were aware that abeut 20 years ago an Act was pasd declaring that if any persn obtained office in any Lsss tical court, with the exception of the Plrerogative Court, after the passing of that Act, he should not be entitled to compensation. That Act was renewed fromn year to year, and in 1847 it was renewedl without making exception of the Prerogative Court. What, then, was to be done in reference to those numerous persona who had accept-ed ofilco since the passng of those Acts ? He thought that it would be very unfair to treat those par. sons as having no right to any compensation. (Hear, hear.) Its was the practice of the Logislature, when it de. prived a parson of anL office be held for life, to give him, by w ofcmenain the full amount of his emaoIlument;- .whnteperson who was removed from an office had hela it on the tenure of being removable at Pleasure, it was the practice to grant him a reasonable compensation in respect of the duties he had performed. He therefore pro. posed, notwithstanding 'shose Acts of Parliamnent, that conspensation shouldl be given on the footing of rons who na edoffice removable at pleasure, dealing withpersn in this situation, who had devoted thesiseve fo many years to the discharge of their duties, to remove them without some compensation would be extremely hard-and he believed such a course would not be in conformity with the practice of Parliament or the feelings of the couantry (Hear, hear,)he proposed that every offlcer should be paid a salary except the district registrars. It was impossible to fix a salay for them, because tho districts would differ so immensely, and whbat would be the services to be rendered could not be told beforenand. Ile proposed that their remuneration should continue to be made, as it had heretofore been without complaint, by fees But with rspect to these fees a table was to be made out by the judge of the court, assisted by the Lord Chancellor and a judge of the common law courts. There had often been a discussion in that Rouse as to the manner in which the privile ed practitioners in the Prerogative Court should he dealt with-he alluded to the proctors. It was ver difficult to admit that the members of a profesSion could have a right to compensation in consequence of an'improvement in the law, and he did not believe that the public would tolerate such a thing as the comPensation dqrlUg life of a whole profession. He thought, therefore, that the most rationxl course to adopt was to retain those prac. titioners, providing at the same timo against exorbitant charges by fixing their fees by authority and by subjecting their costs to taxation, as in the courts of common law. There was no reason why the proctors should not receive adequate and handsome remuneration for the services which they psformed, but he thought it desirable that their fees should be regulated in the manner that he had pointed out. In the Bill of 1854 lie proposed that the proctors should be continued for a limited number of year,e butt he now saw to necessity for letting in any other class of practitioner aud he proposed, in conformity with the recommendation of the commissioners and with two petitions which had been presented by Lord Overxtone-ote from upwards of a hundred of the first merohanta in London, and another from an equal number of the most respectabl; firma of solicitors-to continue the proctors as at present Having thus briefly stted the outline of the measure, and expresed his readin to discuses the details in committee, the noble sad learned lard concluded by moving the second reading of the Bill, The Bishop o?JNGOR (who was nearly inaudible in the gallDr) was understood to stte that all the objections whichhona4L entertained against the Bill when it was first introduced remained in full force, and to complain that, contrary to the recommendation. of the commissioners a clause had been Emuggled into it for transferring the busines of the diocesan courts to the provincial courts. He behlieved that the neasure was calculated to produce a great deal of unhappiness throughout the country, and thought that if existing courts were improved and were properly conducted there would be no necessity for such a Imeasure. The Bishop of LONDON said, that it was not the intention of his right rev. friends to place any diffculty in the way of the passing of this Bill and he trusted that they would always be found ready to concur in any measure which was likely tofconduce to the public good. (Hear, hear.) There was one point, however, which in their opinion deserved to be considered in committee, and it was thiz,-there were certain very important functions per. formed by the officers of the existing conrts,-the registrars and the chancellors-for which, when the Bill pas3ed, no remuneration would be made; and, as this was a matter affecting the public service, it was thought that their lordships would not wish that officers performing important public duties should be unremunerated. Abundant pro- -isions were made in the Bill for secretaries and others to be appointed by the learned judges who were to preside, but there were certain duties intimnately connected with the episcopal office and with the welfare of the church which would afterwards have no remuneration. It was the desire of his right rev. brethren that this matter should be considered in committee, in order that the persons who still continued to perform those important public functions should, if possible, he sO remunerated that the bishops might retain in those offices persons who w-ere fully competent to discharge the duties andwho would ohtain the confidence of the country. lord CAMIPBELL said, that he should give his cordial support to the second reading of the bilL Last session obections were taken to several p..rts of the scheme of his noble and learned friend, and he had been desperately afraid that a disputed probate would involve individuals in an interminable chanoery suit. He rejoiced. however, to find that his noble and learned friend now avoided the very appearance of approaching the Court of Chancery, and this, he thought, was a moat wime resolution. It seemed to him that the Court of Probate would be established according to this Bill in the'most satisfactory manner, and that the coantry might now at last hope to see the objects which had so long been in view well accomplished. There were details in the Bill which would be better discussed in committee; and a good many of the proposals regring procedure would probably require connderation. t there was one point which, as he conceived, touched the dignity of his brother judges in the common law courts, and to which he could not help alluding. It was proposed that this new judge of the Court of rehate, for whom he had a most sincere respect, hould take precedenoe immediately after the Vioe-Chancellors, and therefore before all the puisne judges. Now he thought this ought not to be. The new judge was ultimnately to receive 6,000v., the same salary as the puisne judges, and he did not consider iti would be any di~~ragement to him if he took precedence among the puisne judges according to s-eniority, The Bill waa then read a second time.

Visoount DUNGANNON asked the Postmaster-General wether any inal aangement7had been made by Her Majest-y's Government with the Dublin Steampacket Company relative to the postal and passenger communication between Holyhead and Kingatow.n, what was the natare of such arrangements, and howr soon they were likely to be carried into effect ? The Duke of ARGYLL was happy to inform the noble viscount that an altered, and, as he hoped, an amended proposal had been made by the Government about a week age to the united companies, with a view to secure a more rapid communication between London and Dublin. No answer had yet been returned by the companies, and he thought, therefore, it would he inexpedient at present to enter into any detailed explanation as to the nature of the termns proposed. It wrould be enough to say that they contained 7mportant, and, he did trut, ample modifications of seine points upon which hitherto the greatest difficulties had asen. The Marquis of CL&IRICARDB remarked that the Government had the power of improving the communication between England and Irelacd withont going to any company at all. In fact the service was better performed during the time it was in the hands of the Government, when the Banshee used to make an average passge, he believed, of 4 hours 7 minutes, and the llewellyn of 4 hours 11 minutes. Not only, bowever, was increased rapidity wanted, but greater facilities of communication, both ag regarded letters and passengers. After a few words from Earl riZWTwLLIAx and VisCount DuNGANoN the subject was allowed to drop. The Dulwich Collego Bill was read a first time. Their lordships adjourned at a few minutes after 7 o'clock.

On the motion of Mr. H\YTrR, leave of absence on account of illness was granted to Sir A. Agnew for six weeks. ARMY ESTIMATES. The Army Estimates were brought up by Sir J. RAmsD= and laid on the table. In answer to Sir De L. EvANS, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he could not at present fix the day on which the army estimates would be brought forward, but it would not be until after the navy estimates had been gone through. D1ULWICH COLLEGE. Mr. T. DUNCOMBE asked whether it was the intention of the Charity Commissioners to introduce a Bill this session for the alteration of Dulwich College 7 Mr. BAINES said, it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill for the purpose of giving effect to a scheme drawn up by the Charity Commissioners with regard to the future regulation of Dsilwich Colle It would be introduced in the other HIouse by the Lord Chancell or and he understood that the noble and learned lord intended to move the finst reading this evening. SPECIAL AND CONTRACT DEBTS. Mr. G. CLIVE asked the Attorney-General whether it was the intention of the Government to ixtroduce any measure to abolish the distinction between different classes of debts ? The ATTORLNEY-GBNEBAL said that he hoped to be able immediately after the Whitsuntide recess to bring in a Bill for the purpose of removing the distinction between special and contract debts. LUNATIC ASYLUMS (IRELAND). Mr. BE.YISH asked the Attorney-General for IrelAnd when the report of the Commisioners appointed to inquire into the expenditure upon the lunatic asylums, Ireland might be expected to be laid upon the table of the Hlouse?t Mr. FITZGERAD said that from the quntity of business which yet remained to be done in regard to this com mission there was no reasonable prospect of obtaining the report in time for any useful purpose this semon. ITHE VICTORIA CROSS. Major KNOX asked the Under-Secretary for War whether there was any objection to publish a list of offlcers and men wbose Davke had been sent in by their respective commuding officer; to the authorities for the honour of the Victoria Cross, but who had not been selected for that distinguished honour?! Sir J. RAMSDEN said, that it -wouldia no e1 sisbet publish tho ist referred to, and for reasons in which the aplant member on consideration would have no difmicalty m agreeing. The list of names sent in by comard offlicers was a very long one, and the task of weim. tion was very difficnlt, the numbers of those selected for the decoration bearing but a very small proportion to thoso who were returned as being deserving of it. It never was intended to publish the names of any but of those who were selected (hear), and, though such a publication might be very satisfactory to those whose names were contained in it, yet it must causo some disappointment to many brave men who though not less deserving, had not been so fortunate as to receive the decoration. The object of the Government was to confer the greatest amount of honour with the smallest amount of disappointment, and they would be unwilling, therefore, to consent to the publication of the list referred to. DISEASES OF THE ARMY IN THE CRT EA. r. BATEg asked the TJnder-Secretiry for War if the report on the pathology of the diseases of the army in the ESast, by Dr. Aitken and Dr. Lyons, had beenprinted, and if he had any objection to lay it on the table of the HTouse ? Sir J. RAMSDEN said, that the report referredl to had been printed at the War Department, and there would be no objection to lay it on the table of the House if the hon. member vould move for it. ENDOWED SOCOOLS (IRELAND). Mr. WALDRON asked the Attorney-General for Ireland when the report of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Endowed Sehools in Ireland would be laid on the table of the House? Mr. J. FITZGERALD said, that the commnissioners had made great progress in the preparation of the report, bat in consequence of the illness of one of the commissioners, Dr. Greaves, there had been great delay, and he did not expect to receive it this year. THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINES ROYAL. lord PALMERSTON appeared at the bar, and being called upon by the Speaker in the usual manner announced a message from tho Queen. The noble lord, standing at the bar, all the membera being uncovered, proceeded to read the message, as follows- " Her Majesty having agreed to a marriage proposed between the Princess Royal and LB.H. Prince Frederic Wiliam of Prusaia has thought fit to communicate the same to the House of Commons. Her ffajesty is fully per. suaded that this alliance cannot but be acceptable to 4ll Her Majesty's faithful subjects. The many proofs which the Queen has received of the affectionate attachment of this House to Her Majesty's person and family leave her no room to doubt of the concurrence and assistance of this House in enabling her to make such a provision for her eldest daughter, with a view to the said marriage, as may be suitable to the dignity of the Crown and the honour of the country." The message hAving been brought up and read from the chair, Lord PALMERSTON rose and said,-I am sure that this House will be desirous of taking the earliest opportunity of assuring Her Majesty of the deep sympathy which this House feels in an event so interesting to Her Majesty, and I may say so interestng to the country also; and that, with. out pledging any person in this House as to the detaiL- of the manner in which this House may be prepared to answer the appesl which has been made by Her Majesty, at least 'we shall lose no time in assuring her that we will on an early day take into respectful consideration the message with which she has this day honoured this House. (Hear, hear.) The address which I am about to propose has that object in view. At the same time I cannot refrain from saying, that those who have had the good fortune of being acquainted with the Princess Royal must have observed that she possesses, both in heart and in head, those distinguishel qualities which adorn her illustrious parents, and that she bids fair to hold out in the country of her adoption a rope. tition of that brilliant example of domestic happiness which her illustrious parents have set in this country-a model worthy of the imitation alike of the n;ost exalted and of the humblest of their subjects. (Cheers.) Sir, it is impossible not to see that this marriage, independently of the prospect of happiness which it offers to her Royal Highness from the high qualities of the Prince whom she has selected as her future husband, holdsout to this country political prospects not undeserviog of the attention of this House. We all know how family aliances tend to mitigate those asperities which from time to time must be produced by the diversities of policy which inevitably arise occadonally between great and independent Powors; and I trust that this marriage may be considered likely to produce au increase of cordiality and good-will among the great Powers of Europe. Sir, I shall not further trespass upon the House on the present occasion. On Friday next we propose to submit to the House the arrangement which we think fitting for her Royal Highness, and I sbalt now merely propose the adoption of an address assuring Her Maijety of the loyal attachment of this House to her persoa and throne, and that we shall at an early period take int9 consideration the message which she has addrcssed to us. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord concluded by moving,- " Thxt an humble address be presented to Her 3Maiesty, to return to Her Maesty the thanks of this House for her most gracious oommunication of the intended marriage be. tween the Princess Royal and his Royal Highness Prince Frederick William of Prussia; to express their satisfrction at the prospect of an alliance with a Prinoe of so ilnstrious a family, which they doubt not wil contribute to the happiness of Her Majesty and of her Royal Highness, as well ss prove oonducive to the best interests of this kingdom; and to assure Her Majesty that the House will immediately proceed to the consideration of Her Majesty's gracious message in such a manner as shall demonstrate the seal, duty, and affoctionate attachment of this House to Her Majesty, a just sense of the merits of her Royal Highness, and a due regard to the dignity of the Royal Family and the honour of this country." Mr. DISRAELL-I have the honour to second the ad. dress which has been moved by the noble lord, and which, I am sure, is a faithful ropresentation of the feelings of the House. (Hear, bear.) All of us must be sensible of the gratification which the announcement made this day is cal. culated to inspire; aU must join in the fervent hope and in the fuU belief that this alliance wiiU contribute to the happiness of Her Majesty (hear, hear); aud I am sure that we are al prepared to consider in a becoming spirit and at the proper opportunity the means by which it may be iR our power to accomplish Her Majesty's wishes. (Hear, hear.) The question was put, and the address was unanimously agreed to. It was then ordered, on the motion of Lord PALMrER. STON, that the address shonld be presented to Her Majesty by such members of the House as wero also members of the Privy Council, and that the sabject of Her Majesty's moss gracious message should be taken into consideration on Friday next. ASCENSION DAY. Sir J. PAIUNGTON asked the noble lord at the head of the Government whether he would have any objection to maling an order, as was done last year, that on Ascension Day the committees of the House should not sit until 2 o'clock. Lord PALMERSTON immediately moved the adoption of an order similar to that of last year, and it was unanimously agreed to. THE CASE OF MR. FELIX O'HAMLIN. Viscount RAYNHAM1 called the attention of the right hon. baronet the Secretary of State for the Home Department to the fact that on the 14th inst. a M1r. Felix O'Hamlin was brought up at the police-office, Bow-street, charged with attempting to drive an improper vehicle through Mnarlborough.gato into St. James's Park; that it was stated on the police-sheet and by a police-constable that he was drunk, but that is appeared that this statement was unfounded. He wished to know whether any steps had been or were abeut to be taken by te right hon. baroneb in tlasmnatter. Sir G. GREY said that no complaint hadbeen made to him, nor had the case in any way been brought u nder his notieo. THE PERSIAN WAR. Mr. WYSE asked the noble lord at the head of the Government whether there was any prospect of the papers relating to the war with Persia beig laid uon the table of the House. Mr. BAHJIATE; wished to be informed whether these papers when presented would contain the despatches of Lord Stratford de Redoliffe relating to the proposals made by Feruk Khan at Constantinople before the commencement of the war. Lord PALMERSTON.-We have reasoR to hopo that the ratifications of the treaty with Perias will at an early period be exchanged. Until that is done, of course no pape can be laid upon the table; but we shall then produce such papers as we think will enable the House to form an opinion upon the war. (A slight laugh) Mr. BAILLTE.-The noble lord has not answered my queston. I again ask whether the despatches of Lord Strattard do Readliffe will be laid on th(i table. Lord PALMERSTON.-I can at preset give no answer to that question. MILITARY EDUCATION. Sir DE LACY EVANS rose to ask the noble lordl at the hbea of the Government when the report of the commission appointed to inquire into miitary educational intitutions on the continent would be communicated to the members of this House. He understood that it had already been cirosulated among the members of the other House of Parliament, and he thought it strange that it should be in the hands of the peers some time before it was delivered to members of thei House of Commons. Lord PALMERSTON 'ad that the question had occupied for som6 time the most serious attention of the departments ousrned, and several proposals bad been made to th6se departments, Thoee proposals lad eventually led to the determoination to appoint a hoard composed of moilitary o9icens of great mxerit, presided over by the Comumanderin-Chief, io consider thie syste of educatIo nowv in the objects of their search, and he believed tb3t under the directions of the right hon. member for Carlisle the officers in the Pacific had oLg had their attention turned to the subject. The result, however, had not been mareked with icces though not because tbere was no fguao to be found, or recently thero had been made by the Americans a valunble discovery of twvo islands, and 100 tons of ,guiano deposit had been Sent as a sample to New York. Perhaps if offers of rewards were held out our officers might meet with the rame success as the Arnericans. Tbere owas another expedi. tion in the river La Plata, and from that quarter they might quite reasonably look for information respecting guano, because there was even a better chance of meeting with it there than on the coast of Pata;onia, where some deposita had been found. Without askrng for additional expenditure, he trusted that the House would impre6s on tho Government the importance of making a search for guano a matter of special instruction to officers engaged on foreign service. Sir C. WOOD quite agreed with the hon. member as to the extreme importance of making a search for guano, and the hon. tuember wonld find in the instructions a5dressedto naval officerd at different times the fullest directions given for that purpose. The vote was then agreed to. On the vote of 92,2241. to complete the sumn required for Her Majesty's establishments at home, Sir J. TR ELAWNY took exception to the appointment of the captains superintendent of the different ockyards, and ured that a more practical set of men should be selected for these situations. He thought, for example, that masters in the navy wouldi be well qualified from their previous habits and general attainments to diseharge the duties required of the ruperintendents. Ho wished to get rid of the present superiors, nrd vith this view he should divide the committee upon the vote. Sir C. WOOD suggested that, instead of dividing against the vote, his hon. friend should move as an amendment to reduee it by the smn paid to the superintendents of the different yards. He hoped, however, that the committee would not agree to suc a proposition, because he was per. suaded that a department to be welR managed must be under the control of an efficient superintendent. Sir J. TRELA.WNY did not object to superintendents, but ho objected to the class of men who were appointed to the situation. In order to test the opinion of the committee on the subject ho should move as an amendment that the vote be reduced to 8001., the sum paid to the captain superintendent of the Deptford dockyard. Mfr. W. WILLIAMS supported the amendment. Admiral WALCOTT believed that the proposition, if agreed to, would be very prejudical to the service, Upon a division the numbers wero- For the amendment ....... ... 3 Against it ... ... ... ... 215 Majority ... ... 22 The announcement of the numbers excited sone merrinent. Mr. W. WILLIAMS said that, notwithstanding the ad. verse vote of the committee, he could not refrain from calling attention to the fact that the estimate for the seven dockyards in this, a year of pea, exceeded the sum voted in the last year of war. The vote was then agreed to, as was also a vote of 15,4231. for Her Mesty's establishment abroad. On the vote of 584,3901., for wages to artHiicers, &c., employed in Her Majesty's establishnments at home, Sir JAMES GRAHA said, I wish to offer a few observations to the committee with respect to this vote, I cannot say that I am at the present moment prepared to propose a reduction of it, and yet I think it my duty to call the at. tention of the Goveznment and of the committee to certain circumstances which are made apparent by the vote. In the discussion which has taken plaoe with regard to the number of men employed in the fleet my right hon. friend stated how painful had been his duty in reduoing the number of effective sailors. With my noble and gallant friend the member for Sandwich (Lord Clarence Paget) I rejoice to hear the assurance he gave to the committee that perfect good faith should be observed towards the continuous service men on the part of the Government, and that there was no intention to force them to go on shore without fulfilling in the most rigid mauner the engagements of the public towards them. The discussion -with regard to the number of ships and the class of ships which ought to be built is a very important one, but every consideration with regard to the efficiency of the navy is seoondary when com. pared with that of having at all times available a sufficient number of able seamen to man these ships. (Hear, hear . Varions steps have been taken insuccesive Parliaments, a having this object in view. The arrangements with regard to the ooastguard and those adoppted with reference to the Naval Cosast Volunteers, all have had that great object in views; ut nothing that has been done appears t me likely to be so conclusive aS the reduction of the continuous service men. If I might venture to express an opinion, I should say that I do not think it is so desirable to vote a large number of contimuous service men wviho are well trained in every respect to their profession as to enter, year by year, a large number of apprentices, for the purpose of passing through the navy in tune of peace as rapidly as possible, and thus creating a numerous body of effective seamen. Your object iS to have ablebodied men, and to have the power of puttine your hand upon them when. ever war and the necesk,Mes of the service require that they should be had; and that can only ho done h giving them pensions when they retire. I know that such a syat tem vwould be expensive ; but if in time of peace you reduce the number of trained men. who have served seven or ton years, there would, I think, be no outlay so goodi for the pbhlicasto gat those men small pensions. (H[ear, hear.) Tocoome to Parliament for such a purpose would be a most leg timate course, and this House,iT weIi advised on the subject, would not, I think, demur to it. But I will not discuss that point now. I only hope that in the grual operation of lessening the number of men voted during the 'war it wi be possible to reduce the number of continuous service men without any breach of faith. If, however, the Government should be prohibited by a forced regard to economy from entering into engagementa with these men on their retirement, the matter does not assume the same shape when we come to discuss the system pursued in the dockyards. From vote No. 8 it appears that the number of artifcers and labourers employed in these yards amount to 10,850. And, so far from any reduction being effected, the number voted for the present year is identical with that voted in the year antecedent- that is to say, that, though this is the second year of peace, no reduction whatever has been effected in the number of artficers and labourers. If gentlemen will look at page 51 of the estimates they wiU lnd a detail ot ehe men employed, with their occupations, and it will there bo seen that it is proposed to keep up as a peace establishment a body of 400 shipwrights being identically the number employed during last year. (Hear ht ar.) This brings us naturally to the consideration of the sub;ect mooted by my noble and gallant friend the member for Sandwich (Lord Clarence Paget). It is of the last importance that the question which he mooted should be decided with reference to the class of vessels on which this large amount of labour is to be employed. My noble and gallant friend said he wished this question could be referred to a commission of naval officers. But I know no commission of naval offioers more competent to decide the question than those who constiute the Board of Admiralty. Unfortunately, we have not here a naval officer connected with that Board, to take part in this discussion; but, at the same time, in the absence of any such officer, I must express my opinion that Sir F. Berlkeley. Admiral Dnndas, Admiral Eden, Captain MIlne, and Sir Baldwin Walker form a commission of naval officers as competent to advie my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty on this great point, which I admit is one of vast importanoe, as any body of officers that could be collected. (Hear, hear.) I must also say that I shonld be glad to see my noble friend the member for Sandwich on that commission. His personal reputation, his great Wents, and his hereditary claims entitle him to give an opinion of the utmost weight upon this question; and, though he spoke disparagingly of large line-of-battle ships, yet durng the last war he commanded one of the largest of them, and no officer engaged in that war gained a more highly deserved reputation than my noble friend did. (Hear, hear.) The question he has tbis night raised is one worthy of the most mature deliberation, and so far as I am able to judge, my right hon. friend at the head of the Board of Admiralty gave a wise and prudent answer to that question. I do not think it would be expedient to stop building ships of the largest size. Whatever may in the abstract be the pradent course to follow in that respect, while the great maritime Powers, our rivals, both of Europe and America, continue to build ships of the largest class, it is not prudent for us, wvith a due regard to our maritime superiority, to abstin from doing the same. (Hear, hear.) That it is a question of proportion and degree I think along with my right hon. friend; and I agree with him thatwe ought to have an ample supply of vessels of every clba. (Hear.) Certainly at the commencement of theRussian war it was a great misfortune thaw the building of gunboats and mortar-vesel had been discontinued. When the war began the great strain upon our efforts was to find a suffldoentforce of line-of-battle-ships to meet the Russian fleet should it come outj aud to that point our efforts Were sucefully directed; but the deafciency of smaU vessels was a moat serious deficiency. (Hear, ear.)Myrs hon. friend, recognizing that deciiay did make great exertions to supply the wnt, and at thi; time we are in the happy position of those .who, along with the construction of levinhn ships bavealso built an ample force of gun-bots and other vessels of small aire. (Hear.) On the technical point I cannot gi.7e a positive opinicu, thoughl I bOeve tlat bOth vDu forsig seri ce and inthe defean of dur own shores theae vsels may beemp lI even agist the largest amips but if we ar caled to struggle for our naval superiorit m the Atlantie the 3editerranean, or still more . distant. seas, .JL do not believe it will be. possible to. sup e the necessity of having large fleets. anri ships of the largest size, as well as those of a socondary class. (Hear, hear.) But to return to the poit. from whnch I have somewhat gon astray. I cannot help thinkiug that the nnmber, 10,800 aroficere and.labourers in the navy, including 400shipwrights and 60 boiler-makers, whose appointment wras much discassed in thycommittee on the naval estimates someyar ago, is too great a nuniber to be retained in time of Pece. One of the recommendations of the committee to whch I have referred, in the case of boiler making, wa that artificers should only be employed in repairs, a that the manufacture of the boilers in these yards shorld not be attempted I must take leave to suggest, subject to the epinion of my right hon. friend, whethe in another year when the presaure from the waris not so grt, it will uot 6o matter for serious consideration how far this large vote may not be sasceptible of reduction, with a view to the economy of the public service. . (Hear, hear.) There is another point to wbich I wish to draw the attentionu of my right hon.friend. At psge 51 there isgiven asatement ofthe numberauddesriptionoftheworkmen employedinthe steam factories at Woolwich, Sheernews, Portsmouth, and Devonport, and there is a detail of the factory account giving the iubdivisions of the various dockyards. Now, I siould bave thought it possible to have given a similar return with reference to thie yardT,- wich would'have been very satisfact-7. By such a statement being given ia detail the U[ouse of mumon orill be btter able to xcizeise a olgolem supervisiOn over that portion of the estimates. (riear.) Ny right lon fniend hra stated to the House no doabt amOle reasons why tha reduction has not been carried to e point at which matter stood in previous years; but, entertaining tho opinions I do, and baving due regard to the great importance of keeping up effective steamers at ahy cosin sti I am anxious on the wt of the publio to see the buiness of onr dockyards and factories carried on with a true regard to economy. (Hear, hear.) |Sir E. PERRY wished to ask a question with regard to the vages paid to the men employed in the yards. He believed his right hon. friend had been obliged to raise the vages of many of the dock operatives, but had he gone far enough ? The labourers in the yards were paid at the rate Of 12. a-week, the sasne rate at which they had been paid for 130ye, OnaformeroccasiontheEir6tI,ordof theAdrxiralty dstated that th rise in the wages of these labomers was nbot on ccount of the rise in provisions, bat on account of eir having been placed on job or task work; but in the Admiralty order the rise in provisions was given as one of the reasons of the increase. The aame rise in provisions was still going on; many of the articles of oonsumption, such as leather, coals, butter, were very much higher in price ; and, folowving out the Admiralty order, there ought to be a still further Increase of wages. The Adniralty had beea obliged to increase the wages of the skiled labourers in several branches, and the unskilled labourers ought to participate In the rise. His constituents complained, too, that the clerks in the Admiralty who drew up the estimates adhered so strictly to their old traditions that they never mentioned such a place as Devonport dockyard. It was always unpleasant to the inhabitants of a place to have it called by another name than its own, and f there was any name by which the people of Devonport would dislike their town to be called it was by that of Plymouth. (Laughter.) Mr. P. MARTIN asked that the ronemaker's labourers in the Chatham dnokyard should be paced in the same position as the smith's labourers. These last got 15 a-week on the ground that they could not go home to dine with their families, while the ropemaker's labourers only got 12s., fhough they were placed at the same disadvantage. MIr. Srjeant KINGLAKE complained that the 1,778 artifears employed in the Chathasmdockyards got 30,0001. less in wages thisyear than they had gotinthe last, owingto the boelitien ofthe extra wages which they had been allowed to earn. The wages paid to sailmakers, ropemakers, and spinners were not so high as those paid in private yards; and if this was the case it was probable that Government would not obtain such good workmen. Sir F. SMITH fully concurred in the represeatationq which had been made upon the subject, and recommended to the attentior of the First Lord of the Admiralty the case of the smiths, who were not so welt paid as were similar artisans in private establishments. Admiral PECHELL bore testimony to the acMtvity, zeal, and abrlities of the Prst naval Lord of the Admiralty (Admiral Berkeley). who had done much to make ou-n seamen wel paid and well lothed, and to whom we were mainly indebted for the organization of the coast volunt3ers. He regretted that he wras not present to witness the triumphant reception of these estmsates, and hoped that he woulb net long be absent f.rom the House. Sir W. CODRINGTOlN could not agree with those who thought that wages in tho dockyard should be as h5gh as they were- etide, because service in a yard had many advantages not; possessed by employment in a private esta;blishment. At the same timie, there ought not to be toogreat a differenee; and, loobi'ng; si the wages paid for agrtcultural labour, he was disposed to thaink that dockyardE labourers oughS to receive mere tha 12s. a week. Mr. TC>WNSEND bore testimony to the existence oE considerable distress among the dockyard labourers in the, borough which he represented (Gacenwicli). Sir C. W(i)3;> said he was vesy gbd that the conduct ot the present Boardof Admiralty hadreceivedtheapprobatioan of his right hon. friend the mermber for Carlisle (Sir J. Graham), than whom no one wa& better qualified to pro. nounce an opiniua on such a sabject. In reply to his risht. hon. friends observations as to the aon-reduction of thenumber of artifiers in corequence' of the peace, he (Sir 0;. Wood) must remind him that the number of these mea borne upon the esbablishment was not inereased during the war. In pointof. fact, the numaber of men which he proposed to vote this.year was not so large sa-the number voted m 1845. The addition made during the war was effected by hiring extra artficears of all kinda. En 18rD the number of men borne on the book-s of the deckyards, exclusive of the factories, waal0;872; in 184&it was l2,56;i in 1849 10,092; and ia the present year it would be 10850, being slightly. lss than the number voted In 184-, a year during which no particula exertions were re uired. As regarded the factories the case wa different. Tqhe in.- creasing number-of steamships rendered necessary the employment of an, increased number of smiths and artificers. In the case of, boilermakers the increas, was stiU mora necessary, from, arwsolution whick had been arrived at by former Noards- of Admiralty to have a larger proportion of boilers constructed ia the Goveramentysods, in consequence of complaints that had been made of tAose supphed by contractors. The oxly other point which it was necessary to notice was that which had boen, so stroxgly urged by the representatives, of5 dockyard boroughs-the payment of labourers; and, from the disonsiohwhich had takea place that eveng the House could form an- opinion of the pressure which was brought to bear upon the- Admiralty in any attempt to reduce the expenditoue of tie nation. (EHear, hear.) Before tbe war broke out alk persons, artifioers and labourers, were paid by day work, but when the pressure, ofr w came it was fomd requisite to. stimulate exertion by offering paynmat for job work. It was also necessary to give additioal pay to those who a rpeinten"ed the artificers ar. abourers, and who were called upon for additional exertion.. When peace came there was a gradual recurrence to te.e old system, but there was no sadden discharge of the men who had been taken. during the emergeDey ef tae war. Somethree months'noticewas given of the intention to reduce theestablishment, audi that length of time given to men to fiid employment elsewhere. With respect to those mmn who were upon the, strength of the dockyrds before the war, it had been found, neceasary in sorme eaes-such as alipwrights-to raise the. rate of pay i it was desired to retain thebest men, andL in regard to the kdnds of labour inquiries were now being made. It mxet be remembered that the wages of agricultural labourers were not permanent, like those Of dockyard labourers, and, moreover, they had not the advantages of medical asistanee and pensions, whih gave a great advantage to the latter. As to the rate of wages paid to shipwrighte in private yards, it was imposrible to ascertain any general rule by whioh the Admiralty could be guided, hut the Government was only anxious to do justice to allipersons whom it employed, while at the same &i me it paids due attention to the mteresta of the public. The vote of 584,3904, to complete the summ requisit for defrayiing the wages of *rtificers, &., employed in. ;er M ajestys establishments at home, was then agreed to. Trhe next vote of 33,38.1., to complete the amountreqired tdefWray the wages of artifoers, Ac., employed in ier Majesty's establishments abroad, rwa agreed to. UTpon the vote of 895,4504, to complete the sum required to defray the cost of naval stores for the building an repair of ships, Sir G. PECHELL called attention to tho uneessay waste of coal by vessels of war. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY was not prepared to ohasacterize the estimates generally as being extravagant, but hethought that if any extravagance could be attributed to1 them it would be upon the present and the following vote. It did appearto him that the sum for naval stores was a large one. lmring the last three years, speaking in round numbers, no less thanu8,000,000C. had been voted for naval stores, and of that sum 7,000,0001. had been voted in the lAs two years. What he wished the right hon. gentleman the FirstLord of tho Admiralty to explain was, how the oDmmittee could exercise any judgment upon the subject without knowing something about the stock in hand. (Hear.) The amount required for the present year was unparalleled in time of peace. and required some explanation. He ad also been informed that stores which had been sent to ihe Crimea, and which had notbeen used. had been sold as old stores. (EHear, hear.) In fact, he had been told that a deputy-paymaster, in referenceto the subject, had said, "Oh ! we can live a lon time on old stores." If such were really the case, it appeared to him that it was something like buying in a dear market and selling in a cheap one, a processby no mes for the benefit of the publio. If a principle of economy was to be introduced, the present was the year for commencing it, and the large vote for naval stores did not appear to hima goodcomniencement. Hethoughtalsotbat itwouldbe desirable tohavo it expressed inthe estimateshowmuch was actually required for naval purposes-he meant war purposea-and how much for miscellaneons purposes. (Hear, Mr. KINNAIRD was glad that the subject of the sale of new stores as old store had been referred to. He was informed that among the stores which had been sold were some carpets which were cut in the middle in order that they might be sold is duamged stores, because it was 3llegal to sell new stores. (Hear, near.) Sir C. WOOD said that during the war thero had been a great consumption of stores, snd it was therefore necesary during the present year to take a larger vote than would be required in subsequent years, in order to place th dstores in band on the sAme footing that they stood upon before the war. In the item of timber alone, of which it was necessry to keep a larges aock for building ships, in the year IS52 the consumption bad been 18,734 loads; in 1853, 20,289 loads; and in- 1866, 40.000o loas Now the ship. building timbher instore in 1S5~ha een %5(Ooed,and in 1856 56,900 loads, so that there wu deficiency of nearly 7,000 loads, wbich-it wa ncsayto replace, The contracs aIso for timber, like most other contract, exteamled over twro or three years, and it wrould have boee :toeet iuiproptr on tbe part of the Government If the. had 'lift the yard b*lo1qw their egiat establishment of timber ihiiSNOWlding. The s me reason pphd to other artcles. much as helne,-an vs iJ A d copper, especially td copper; a *veijargb:quantity o'hich1hidbeen used In th contraictioh ofgtmnboata, and which it was necessary to replaes. Itr was hardly worth while to go into the details of the different itenis; bht that waS the remson which applied to all the heavy stores, - Every means had been aen to diminish the consumption of coal in the navy, ad the most strineientorders had been enforced, as far as they possibly coul, both on account of economy and foi' the sake of effioiency. With respect to the sae af old stores, not havg bea of the subject before, he could not ay whether the sttements now Nmde were true or not. He thought, however, thatthey could not be oorrect, and that the stores in question-oould not be navil store. Great quantiti.s of stres were nt to the Crimea which were notwantew t for the'army, and which, if they had not been sold, would bave rotted in the warehouses He h.d received the follow, ing letter from the heAd of the Stor Department in the navy with regad to the alleged ale of stores:- " Somerset-house, Feb. 14. Dear Sir,-It is not true that while we have been selling provisions returned from the army in tho EAst We ha been pirchwdng the like stores for the use of the navy ; but, on the contrary, we have appropriated to the service of the navy all such articles returned from the army as were found fit for and could be consumed in the navy. I" remain, dea Sir,'yours faithfully, "THoxAs T. GsuRr. "The R*ight Hon. Sir C. Wood, Birt,'G.C.B." . He hoped that lettfi would be xutisfctQ to the oam- mittse as showing that there had been no undue waste of stores in the navy. (EHear, hear.) Mr. W. WILLIAMS asked whether it was true that somre prOpred cocoa returned from the Crimea in a perfect stato was sold at 40. per cwt., while at the same time a snantity of unprepared cocoa was contracted for by the raval Departmnent at 793. Hle had been told ali tha quantity of coal, worth about 40Z., having been left tomewhere in the East, ws kept there for thre years at an expense of 1001. per annum. Sir C. WVOOD observed that it was perfectly impossible for the head of any department to asmwer assertions of that kind without having reWeived previous notice of them. (Hear, hear.) If hon. gentlemen bfore making such state- ments would bave the kindness to inform him of them he I would make the requito inquiries, and then he would bo in a condition to give an answer. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BLAKEMORE remarked that the right hon. baronet had given a satisfac'ory explanation with respect to timber and coaS, but had omitted to state his reasons for reducin t;he estimate for steam machinery from 600,0001. to 345,001.e Was the right hon. baronet sure he was right in making so lrge a reduction in one of the most important branches of the navy? He could not understand how, if the Govern ment were honestly determined to maintain the eficiency of our naval armaments, thoy could propose in the first year of peace to reduce the expenditure for steam machinery. He noped that no pressure would induce them to cripple our fleet of steam vessels, the chief source of our national strength; but that they would pay the closest attentien to what was going on in Armerica and other countries. The vote was then agreed to. The next vote was 378,4134, to defray the expenses of new works, improvements, and repairs, inthe naval establish3nents. An Hox. MmuisxR asked for an explanation of the vote ef 1,0001. for the construction of a tunnel under Picola Marina at'Malta. Sir C. WOOD said that it had been found neesay to constract the tunnel in order to enable the hbourers ia the doekyards to pass with facility from one dockyard to another. Mr. HENLEY complained of the large amount which had been expended in tho purchase of timSer. Me believed that Eome had been used for the purpose of making what were called gunboat slips, those slips having been consi- dered necessary an con seuence of the genbeats having been bilt of green wood. Hle should wish to know whether they had been built by contract or not. sir C. WOOD said that the greater portion of the gent beats bad been built by contract in the yards of our- Sir J. GRAHAM said he quite conec7ed with the hon. gAntleman opposite (Sir H. Willoughby)that the vote under the consideration of the committee wvas one which required to be closely investigated. 1e wished topwatsome questions to his right hon. friend the First Lord of the AdmirAlty with respect to it, to which he had no doeht he would be able to give a satisfactory answer, and which it would, perhaps, be for the conveniensa of the coimnittee that he should put at once in order thac his right 1ess. friend might be able to reply to them by means of a single statement. The first questioc which he desired to ask related to the large out}ay of 160,0001. which it was contemplated to make at Chatham for the first time. He could well understand the prudence of expending even a considerable sum of money npon the repairs of our steam machinery, but he was of opinion that upc the whole Sheerness had been most judicionSly chosen for the purpose, and the outlay iu that quarter having been commenced he should confese that he was somewbat surprised that a large outlay had a&3o& been entered upon at Chatham. That was a subject on whixb he desired to have some explanation, and he should aiao wish to learn something with respect to the proposition which appeared upon the notes forthe purchase of new land witlr the view of completing the works at Keyham. HIe might alo remark that the powdrrnagazine at Bull Point had albeady coet a sum amounting to 147,0004, while it was proposed to lay out upon it for the current year a further sum of 25 000'. He Had hoped that the works in counenien with tihe breakwatar at Plymouith would have been brought to a conclusion before now, yet it appeared that a further sum was necessary for the purpose, vwile a vote of 2,6007. was asked for widening and length. eDin the dockse at Pembroke. These were matters upon vhici he thought the committee bad a-right to eapect some further Information. (Hear, hear.) MIr. MAGUIME said he wished, beehre the Birt Lord of the Admiralty replied to the right ho3n baroneti e aestiaos, to call his attention to the circumstance, that white it was proposed to expend the enormous sumn of 600,0QV. upon different worka-in England, 1,500. only were to be voted for carrying out a, similar object in Ireland. (Hear, hear.) That he Mr- aguire) regarded as- a policy unjust towards the sie country and dangerous to the pLblic service. The result of that neglecthad been that one of the finest harboura of refnge-4Queenstown-which the united kingdom could-beashad been turned tono account what. ever, notwithstanding that Sir G. Sarto:xus had given it as his opinion thab it was highly expedient that both a naval station and a dockyard should be established in that quarter. The right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle could bear testimony to the. advantages which it possessed, for, whPe engaged-dariag his offical visit to the south of Ireland in 185S-in laying the foudation-stone of- the Admiralty pier at Queenstown, ene of the largest vessel5 in the empire had entered the harboonr at low Water. Ee should for those reasous strongla urge upon the First Lord of the Admiralty the propriet oz directing his attention to the subject of converting Questown into a harbour of-refuge. Mfr. BLAKEMORE wished to know- iF the Government had hadunder itsconsideration the utterly defeafeless state of the coast of South Wales? Sir C. WOOD said, that it was proposed to. employ convict labonr to a considerable extent *. eJhatham. A convict prisois had been built near the outer wall of the docxkyae }, and a great deal of work in stacking timber was abont to be done by the convicts. Sheer. ness was sitmated in such au inconvenient position that he was disinelined to expend money in works there, but a great deal bad been spent, and it was neassary to be able to fit and repar vessels tbat came in there. Some heavy expenses were necessary at Chatham.and he hoped to be able to construct there, as at Portsmouth, plaas imwhich the gunboats coula be brought up. Almostthe whole of the expenditure for Pembroke was a re-vote, as it was found impossible to execute the worls within the year. It was found necessary to widen the dock there to admit the larger vessels now built. The votes for Keyham were for the most part in execution of the designs already approwed. He hoped to provide a place here where the gunboats might be drawn up, and also to erect barracks for the sailors. (Hear, hear.) The vote for the breakwater at Plymouth was a supplementary estimate. It wasf oand that the foroe of the waves was so great that the largest stones were lifted and thrown over the breakwater, and It Was therefore neesary to alter the oonstruction. The amount already voted was 26,0001. the vote now required was w 0., and the further estimate to complete the work i was 36i0001., making a total of 750W0i. With regard to the propoaal about Queenstown, the works now in progress in the existing dockyards required so large a aum that until they were completed he could not hold out auy hopes of undertaldng large works in Qneenstown harbour. With respect to the suggestion of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Blakemore) it was intended that one of the coastguard vessels should remain in the Britol Channel, but lying there was found to bo so dangerous that the vessel was ordered to Milford Haven. Sir J. GRAHAM agreed that it was of the last importance that we should maintain, at least, the present establishrnent of marines. He was of opinion that in time of peaCe the marines shoulld form the larger portion, it not almost tho whole of the garrisons of some of the outports, such as Devonport, Portsmouth, Chatham, and Woolwich. Bat it was impossible to regard them in this light as apart from the army.-and he tbought it quite posible that some srrangement should be made with the Minister of War, so that the barracks hitherto occupied by the army at Devon. port, Portsmouth, &t. should be given up to the MarIes. It appeared, however, that a very large vote was taken for rew barracks for the Marines, both at Devonport and Portsmouth, and, he believed, at Woolwich, while in the army estimates there was also an outlay for additional barracks for the army. Sir C. WOOD said, that the Marines had very good and extensive batracks at Woolwich, and it was not proposed to make any addition to them. With regard to Cbatham, it had for many years been considered advisable to enlarge the Marine barracks there, and it was proposed to be done by getting rid of a particular class of houses that existed near the barracks. With rogaxd to Portsmouth they were building additional baraclks for the army, and could aot spare any accommodation for the Marines, With regard to PItmouth he had given up to the army the MilIbay barracks, and the army had given up to the navy a building and some land a4iacentto the marine barracks. There again the present barracks were not sufficient for the army. Sir C, NAPIER suggested that an arrangement should be made to put the troops at Portsmouth in barracks at Gosport, and to locate the marines in the beet place for emuactlon-viz,, at Portsmouth. Mr. WELEBY thought the answer of the First Lord did not go to the point. The right hon. baronet (Sir J. Graham) wanted the soldiers taken away from seaport towns and tbeMarinesput intheirplace. Therighthon. baronet(Sir C. Wood) said there was no room for the Marines, because the soldiers were there But if tbe aoldierswere not there room-migh-tba found- Tbersmightle good rowons vsy the soldiers should be thery, but the righlt hon. baronet WA notitadbthem. . . - a sir C WOOD had understood the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Graham) to ak why an rrangement could not be suede fortht amy to giveup Xosne brsaks, and. thueM e.to occupy them. His aswer waithat the preneth,baestk aneommo8ati6n-wss so .ba tAt it was o erect new buildings. Sir J. GRAHAM said the right -hon, -qentlemin f! Benley) had exactly apprehended what ho wasbed to convey. Assuming that in time of- peac the garion at Devonport coned of 5,000 men-3,009 soldier and 2,o0o MarinesIt was suggested that henceforth there should he 3,00 Marirnes and 2,000 soldiers If there were oaccmodation for 3,000 soldiers and 1,000 were removed, to he replacd by 1,000 Marines, he suggested that the 1,000 Maies should ccupy the barralcks of the 1,000 soldiers, The vote was then aeed to. and also a vote of 20,0001 to complete the sum for medical stores afterwhich the ch4irman reported progre,and the House regimed. TRANSPORTATION AND PEAL SERVITUDE - - BILL. This Bill, as amended, was considered. Mr. WALPOLE wished to see the regulations proposed bythe Home-ofice, upon which the working of the Bill muI depend, before it pwed- * Sir G. GREY said the regulations would depend on the shape the Bil would ultimately amume. No doubt, It would receive full oonsideration in the other House, and as sOon as posible he would prepare the regulations. * Mr. HENLEY exprewsed a hope that the third rekding would not be taken at a late ho0*-. Sir G. GREY promised to give a fair opportunlty for discnusion. . Th 'tbird readL&gwas then fxc d for to.mor6ow, force and to mature a plan. to be finally adoplec for the education of officers of the army. Whenever that plan was matured and approved by the Government there wou34 not be any difficulty in laying it before the House, but itwouldhe neitheruual nor convenient to lay before' Parliament the disjointed elements upon which suoh a- plan might be constructed. Sir DE L. E;VANS had unnerstood that the report tow^hich he h4d referrd bad been circulated among members. of the other House of Parlbament, and, if so, he coul1d nsot see wthy t should not also be placed in She hands of members. Lord PALMERSTON, in reply to tho gallant General, could only put to him the question by whom that report had been circulated. Such a report might have been circalated by individuals or by neow prg, but be was not aware' thtit had been circalated by the Government. Mr. S.

Wb WILLIAMS AND THE, OppIcEIE4tho Teha On the motion that the Speker leave the chair to goint> Committee of Supply, Colonel NORTH seai that before the House went int,> committee he wished to give the hon. maember for LAmubeth an opportunity of explaining away certain imputstions which he had casth not only upon the reputation, but upow. the personal courage of offices of the army. A cer h degree of importance was always attached to a speech mnad 3 by a nember of that Hlonse out of doors, but that em. portando must he much increased when tho speech was mnade by a tember who, according to his own statement6. the Queen and her Government deoghted to honour ("1 hear," and a laugh), and who, upon his own showing7, had refused the highest honours 'which could be offered t> him by Government. (LAughter.) Now, the speex b which he begged to caU the attention of the hon. gentlemam was one phich he had made to his constituents, and whichb, like all the speeces hich emanated from him, wasen cipally composed of attacks ur the ry h in gentleman began by attacking theig personage ri he' land for paesingedays in ole ma exendrng her hopintality to o=ices win the am.ell, of the hon. enteman thought that th e officers ot ea were tnly c ofw her subjectsh Her,ajs owghich toshond nvrthe r, attention, beoundayiom.re hat lie buw beggede particularly to celerat in the hon. gentleman tor one part of the speech of the hon. gentlem whicho hoped he would have the frankness to expla The hoen. gentleman hadsaid, "It has been said by many, and rghtlyo said, that when the war broke out the army was totally ine "picient; so it was with th exception o the severegnbravery Of the soldiers, when the officers alone ware incapable." Nowfc that was the most severe charge which oould be brougf i against a British officer, and one which should neverhe made, upon light foundation. (Hnar, hear.) He saw before himr three gallant Generals, the hon. and gallant member for Westmmnster, the hon. and gallant member for Greenwichb. and the hon. and gallant member for Caine, who could telL the hon. gentleman webther British officers were accustomed to shrink in face of danger; and during the last war nothing had prodnedec so great an impression upon the privatsoldiers of the army as the example shown by their offices (some of them boys in form, but lions ia heart) of patient; endurance under unparalleled hardships. (Hear her )- If the bun, gentleman meant that as long as a BritUed offiacer reuained alive he was to be stigmatized as a cowarcl, led him say so, but he thought few would agree with, the statemnent. Why, what was the result of the four battles m the Crimean At the battle of the Alma no 1esa than 25 officers were kiled and h fwounded; at Inkerman 43 were killed and 101 woendels; at Blaklava 13 killeoe and 27 wounded- at the Rodan there were 89 killed asnt wounded; and a the finalt asaultthere were 53 ledana wounded. The total number of officers who died in the, Crimeas wa 3, And 1,412 were invalide making a totab ofl1,795 officers.Among theoffioers of the army were to hofound not ody reprentatives of the four countries formieTh Great Britain and Ireland, but also of all classes of society, from a prince of the blued to the son of the peasant whohad by his own merit and conduct won his rank, ana lie' was suLre that there was no officer who would not d- hi& utmost to do his duty, and prove himself worthy of the, respct andl admiration of his cotuntry. (EHear, hea.) Thehon. gentleman had ever since he enteredl that House, undertaken the amiable task of endeavouring to sow a bad feeling between the officers and psivates of the army. ("No, no.") Now, he could telli the hon. gentleman that among no two classes of Eer Mrajestys subjects, considering the difference of birth and situation-a difference rendered greater by the stern, butr necessary laws ofdiscipline-was more true good feeling, he' might say affection, to be found, than that which existe between the officers and men of the army. (Hear, hear.> If the hon. gentleman had undertaken the task of sowing bad feeling between those two classes he could only say that it was a Herculean task, and one not likely to be carried out muccessfully by a gentleman who, while he never lost an opportunity of vilifying the officers, at the mie time voted against; everv measure which touched the comfort of the private soldier. (Hear, hear.) Mr. W. WILLUIMS thought that if the hon. gentleman had simply reLired an oxplanatione from hiat ho might; have spared hrmself the la onr of so long an harangue. He should wish to know where the hon. and gallant membe-t had seen the statement upon which his observations bhu. been founded, because upon that point he had given no information to the Honse. Colonel NORTH.-In l&e~ Eimu. hmr. beILLIAueeS continued.-Well be that au it moca he would venture to say that he had never express aan opinon with respect to the courage of the officers anti soldiers of our army which was not couched in terms of the sratest possiblo prise. Indeed, from the statementwhich the thohon. and gallant member had read to the' House it did not ,ppear that the expression of a contrary opinion had been lad to his eharge. At all events,hsh sentiments upon that head rwere qnte the reverse of thosf whiech the hon. and gallant member seemed to impute to him, because he had upon more than uponone occasion in that Eouse, when the management of our army haie been made the subjetof grave commeat and no sligahn disapprobation, borne his testimony to the gallantry bg which our troops had invariably beee distinguished, (hear hear.) He hat not,it was true, always greatly complimented thon e who were e,gaged in connexion with tho highest departments ofste arimy while in the field;- but of the conduct of the soldiers and regimental offlers haehad never spoken in any other language than that of the highest; admiration. He felt surprised that the hon. and gallant gentleman should, in order to make an attace upon him, base his accusations upon a report in o a newspaper which contained only a portion of a speech which, if it bad been given in full, would have shown that even upon the very occasion to whiroha the hon, and galant member hwd called the attention of tho House he hac' expressed himself in terms the moat laudatory of thosebrave men whose conduct he wastold hohad aspersed. The hon. and gallant gentleman's statement to the effect that ho (Mr. Williams) had done his utmost by his observations to produce an iU-feeling betwoeen the men and their offieers was totally unfounded. AHe certainly had opposedl that reckldess military expenditure of which tho hon. aned gallant member was the resolate advocate, but the hoanoth and efficiency Of our army he was as anxious as the hon. and gallant member conld be to maintain. (Hear, hear.) GENERAL ASHIBURNHAM. Sir W. CODRtNGTON then rose and said-Reports off election speeches in the newspapers ought perhaps, Sir, to me paniedover as lkel5 to a efreqbently incorrect, and, as thhon member has denied the charge that hr ever said anything caluolated to engender ill-feeling between the officers an men Of our army, Of course we are whond to believe in the honesty and truth of that statement. The superior officers of that army ecan, in my opinion, stand upon ther own merits, and need, I think, no defence in this House irons any individual. b (ear, hear.) I wish, however, to take advantage of this opportunity to refer to a very serioue report of an anonymous nature, and purporting to eome from a "Staff Officer," tendingto affect most materiallythe character of a gallant General who was a short time since sent out to China with a high command-I allude to General Ashburnham. I hope that among the qualifications for the position of a staff officer discretion will for the future occupy a prominent place, because not only from one, but from many publications whioh I have seen> lately it is easy to proeive that this quality has not always been exhibited. Now, the report to which I refer has evidently emanated fromu a staffofficer on full pay who wras engaged in the operations at the Sntle;, and bears the stampof authenticity from t!he Dnuber offaets which it states. It, of course, was published throughout England-Imaysay, thronghout the world. General Ashburnliam, who hacd started upon his excpedition,.is, a week after he has laSh tmis country, made the subject of remarks affecting not only his publoi conduct as a General, buthis private character as a courageous officer. (Hear, hear.) I shall, however, take the liberty of reading to the HoUse a- letter which was written by an eye-witness-which thoe author of the report was not-of that which occurred upon the morning of the night which the "Staff Offloer" da.- scribes. The writer Of the letter was an offioer of the 62d Regiment, which was employed in assaulting the lines of' Soraon upon the morning to which I allude. The name' of the officer I shall mention, if any hon. member wisher to know it. Hlis letter is as followvs,- ia "You havo seen the attsak on General Ashbnrnham. Well, with a soldier that part Of it about taking the outpoe. iseasilydisposed of General Ashburnbam had received his orders from the Commander-in-Chief, and obeyed them in preferenoe to the suggestions of two junior ohicers, whomust have had no small sharo of impudence to goto himwith their opinion after being told he had recoived his orders anti intended to obey tbom. Now, I will state on ay honour what I saw of General Ashburnham on the day of Sobraoul. He commanded the Queen's 9th and 62d, as also a nrative* corps. After the flank oompanies of the 62d hid got int the outpost which they were ordered to take the remainderof the regiment was ordered to remain about 200 yards in. rear for the protection of some artillery. General Ashburi. him then left the regiment, and went to the Sth Regiment and the native corpe-48th Bengal, I believe-some 30 y4rds in our left rear. The 62d were in a nullah, iwhioh ran nearly perpendicular to the batteries, but it affoj&e some cover, snditwastaken advantaof. Theretheregi_ nient remained nearly two hours, losing some 14 men from round shot. General Ashburoham wa with the largest 4.1; of his brigade. We received an erder to join him, Whiac we did as quic}ly as we could, and found him fomin3g ling. When all were in line-three regiment and a eompany of native rifles -the brigade ad' ed aMd as we approache4 stOate Of Intimate allhaire crith our neurest neighbours ; and. long9 may that affiance continue, f or the benefit of both coun-!: tries. No mpa can foresee what may happen at any moment.: France has been paying the greatest possible attention of late years to the efficlency of its navy. We have recently s een the efforts inLde in the same directien by our trans. athnichnsflk.And,th htrust that peaceomay long maritime Power In the worla-shiould be greatly to blame' were we to neglect those preparations which -we find other: nations taking, and which wotLId enable us to meet ay adlversary who may be opposed tonus should hostilities unfortunately break out. Another consideration is that the carmy end navy are nowadays far more expensive than they used t-o be. The additional expense of a steaTa navy. compeare with a sailfing navy is perhaps, greater than hon. gentlemen may be aware of. These are the principal, reasons why I do not think it possible to come down tD the low level of our former naval estimates. With thes prelimi - 3aryobservatiousIcomeatonceto the presentestimates.;Theyaze, ashon. gentlemnioknow, dlivided into twoz=et branches -t-he effective aud non-effective votes. The latter, conListing chiefly of half-pay and pensions, regulated almost entirely by Act of Parliament, are very little subject to the discretion of the Admiralty, and cannot be increased or diminished by them. The non-effective votes are aibout 1,300,0001. for the first vote, and 200,0004 for miscellaneous services. The effective votes, in round niumbers, amount to 6,500,0001., and are prttty equally divided between men and material, They include wages of seamen, victuals, expense ofthe coastguard, wages of labourers and salaries of otficers in the dockyards, stores, &c. The first item of charge is, of course, the men; and the first vote, Sir, which I shall put in your hand is the number of 3men to be voted for the remaining portion of the year-the same number, of course, which 1 proposed in the early part of this year,-namely, 38,700, inclusive of 5,700 eoastguardsmen Including seamuen and boys, the total number voted in 1849, 1850, and 1851 was 28,000; in 1852 and 185 it was 33,000; in 1854 48,500; in 1855 54,000; at the beginninig of last year we took a vote fo 60,000, which we reduced subsequently to 40,000, and in w0hic a further reduction was made of 7,000. The increased force was readily adopted. we bore at the end of 1854-5 the full number of men voted. Six thousandl more men were voted by the House, but before it became necessary to raise them the prelimainaries of peace were signed, and the men vere never actually levied. About 54,000 men -were borne on tire estimates, and therefore the actual reduction is about 14,000, A more difficult task than the reduction of the men I never had to perform. (Hear, hear.) In former timnes, when ships were paid off as a matter of couirse the matter was eomnparatively easy ; but now, with the disposition 6f the best umea to remain ins the service, the task of reduction is not only the most difficult, but also the most painful one I ever had to discharge. Preceding Boards of Admiralty have done much to imaprove the condition of the seamen in every wayI- the best mnen are now unwilling to leave the navy~ adi hope the House will forgive mue for saying thati have been most unwilling to pay hemoff (Har.) When the Albion was paid off not a single man quitted the service; and when the Duke of 'Wellington with 1,100 men was paidl off, 210 only were dig. charged. No ships have been commissioned for the last 15 maonths except thcos absolutely necessary for reliefs, and the 11 gunboats sent to China ; and I was unable before the Ist of April to effect reductions in the number voted by the Hlouse. At the beginning of the maonth we hAd 8,000 mena over the numnber proposed to be votedI for this year ; and I was obliged to have recours to muchstroniger measues~, even allowing the continuous-service men to take their discharge, if they wished to leave the service. It is true there is a considerable numor of ships ordered home and oni their passage The complement of those ships is about 8,000 ; and whenl thy arrive in Englan.d our object may be ac'complished; but at the rate of proceeding adopted last year-that is not dischargin those men whno were anxious to remain-we were unablemin the course of the year even to approach the roducotion we may fairly make for the Permanent service of the country. The House wfi observe that the difficulty, arises, not in the reduction itself, but in effecting it within the given time. I believe that 33,000 men, or thereabouts, will adequately provide for the service of this country during peace ; but I do not think we can safely reduce our peace establishment imuch below that number. As I have already intimated, the transition from a war to a pseae standard is a qutestion of time. Those men, however,whohave been discharged-mnen, that is, of good character-have alileft tho service of their own accord, I hopebefore long that we may bring down the numiber nearer to the force whinch we call upon the House to sanction for the year. Yet I am indisposed to get ridi of any man without hiis free consent, and therefore, if at the end of the year I may somewhat exceed the prescribed strength l hopelIshallreceive the indulgence Of the House. I am mOst anxious to k-eep faith to theo strict-est letter with the British seaman, and not to inflict hardship on any man who-caeforward to serve his country in time of war, and who may now desire to continue in, the nv.(Hear, hear.) These obserations, of course, apply Uto te immediate Period of a reduction froma a war to a paeestablishmnent. I ha-ve not the least doubt that, whnonce you have made the descent to a peace establishmeat the system brought into play before the war may resumne its ordinary and even course. Then You wil have no difficulty in so regulating the entries as to maintain what. over nuniher may be adequate for the navy. I feel confident that the experience of the last war and the precedent which has been set of showing every consideration to the mien, not only while in the navy, hut when leaving it, will produce an excellent effect, and tend on future occasions, should an increase of men be demanded greatly to faailtate new entries. (Hear, hear.) Wrth regard to the force pr mnauently to be kept up, the number we propose is 3:,000-. the same number as that voted in 1852 and 1853. The amount of our force ought to be determined partly by the protection required for our trade and com-. moclce in every part of the world, andi partly by the naval strength of other countries. Hon. gentle. mnen know that our commerce extends over every quarter of the globe, and that there is hardly a coast or a Port to which it is not requisite from timeO to time to send our ships of war to look after andyarotect British subjects and their property. Scarcely a m- arrives from a distant part of the -world by which we are not assured by our con-. suls of the valuiable assistance and security-to say nothing Iof the confidence-afforded by the presence of our navy. Indeed, there is hardly a foreign town in the remotest regions in which British merchants have not settled, in which trade is not carried en by British capital; and it is obvious, therefore, that the peace and tranquility of those towns are essential to the interests of British merchants, and to the prosPerity of the British community. It is, of course, impossible precisely to estimaate -what may be the value of the protection extended in any particular case. The service which our ships of war afford to our merchant Iships at foreign stations in different parts of the world IS of the greatest pecuniary value to this country, but the number of those ships of war is not sufficient to meet the numerous demands that are made upon tham by the consuls in the differnt Ports, backed by the representations of the maerchants trading there. I think it is exceedingly desirable that wre should have this, and every year, a home squadron for the practice of our naval offiers. (Bear, hear.) At present ailmost the whole of the ships of the Royal Navy are scattered throughout the world, and they have scarcely ever an OPPOrtunitY of acting together. I have no doubt that the hon and gallant officer (Sir C. Napier) will say th-at our fleet wlould requireoconsiderable driling before they could act in abdy. And if that is the case it is evidently desial ht there should he squadron evolutions at home almost every year, for the practice of our naval officers. But the demands upon the nav r this year so great that we have no vessels at home, aItise thle practice of other nations in ordinary times to ma ake their navies perform evolutionsJprziodically, with the view, of preparing them for war. Th Rusa .navy performs evolutions at sea twice every year. When the Grand Duke Constantine visited Touilon the other day eight sanlof the line were sent to sea for inspection ; but I am very much of opinion that 'when his In,perial Highness comes to this country we shaUl not have more than a couple of ships of the lire at home. In ordinary times we ought to :=-7e on our shore an adequate naval force ready to be sent out upon any expeditiOn. We stand at a great disadvanitage with regard to other nations so fa as the immedliate manxing of our navy is concerned; because, whlle ours is a voluntary service, other nations can, by their systema Of comPulsory service. Put on board their fleets in a ver short time a number of mnen much larger than we could hope to bring together in the same space of time by our volunteer systemn. I have. however, no doubt that in the course Of two years we shouldi be able to enLrol in 9ur navy as many mnen as might be required-say, 20,000, But what we want is, not that that number of men should be put on beard at the endI of two vears, but in two months or in two weeks. (Hear, hear) Rtussia and France can do that. (Eaear, hear.) Their sYstem of impressment enables them almost immediately to make Up great navies, and no doubt ina tirmes of extremity we ourselves should be justified in resorting to that barsh measure. But surely we ought to do everything in our power to prevent the necessity of having recourse to a measure of that description, and I think that this country will not grudge any reasouable expenditure that may be niecessary to prepare us to put our navy on equal terms wit our pponnts t th comenceentof a. war.

I think .1 stated last year, that a commission of French officers_reported thab 40,000 men eminently qualifde4 might bo calted out.fgr immeate Eervice in the French navy, and that 20,000 more, not quite so prepared, but seanen, nevertholess, might be made avail. able in case of necessity. Of course, the Frefichiauthorities could. not lay their hands upon the whole ot those 60,000 men at once; but suppose they could only put a amall pro., portion of them on board at once-say, one half, or even one third. France would at once have a navy oonsisting of 20,000 men in a high state of discipline. I thought it quite neessay last year to take steps for the formationsof a reserve naval force for this country; but I do not think that that is enough. I do not see how we can depend upon being pre. pared to meet the exigencies of war without maintaining a very considerable fleet permanently at home. If such a fleet be maintained I have no doubt that partly by the seamen already employed partly by the coast reserve, and partly by those who I am sure will in a time of war enter the navy as readily as those who entered it at the commencement of the lat war, we shall be able to put to sea a fleet that will defend the, honourandrmaintainthesafetyofthis country. Ofcowre, it is impossible to say exactly what ahould be the number of men in the home squadron of wbich I speak. Witk regard to the next item in Vne estimates, I have to observe tkat we ,propose l5,000 as t'e.a number of marines forthis yer. my right boa. fnnd ' 3lir J. Graham) stated two or three ye is agO that les~ing raibed the number of marines to 16,000 u should h.>sery unwilliag to see them reduced below'rteh arumbe:n. sew r.) We have, however, this year reduced them by l,Ilb Tfe Seel it imposible to reduoc the .eamaen cDul+y4*Q ~ jjAxJeq. that we had proPo 1, hb x thought it wasonly fais,toedtto them by 1,000. I propose. 31everthe1lss, that the nuamber of marines sbould never be reduced below 15,'000, because I1 believe that it would be moa0t ulnwiEe and imPOlitic to maintai less than that number. Everybody` 1-nows that 15,000 is a larger number of rmarines than wre have been accustomed to maintain, but inasmnuch as -we have now a new coast-guard service it will be necessary to maintain a correspondinig number of marines. These men are employed during peace in garrisoning oa great rts. When war breaks out they are put on board the ~yal Navy. I am happy to say that the coastguard service that I had the honour of proposint last yerhas worked most admirably,.Ha,her) ag sishave been stationed at the different yorts, and a areproportion of the men have been found ti or sea service. The regulationssat each station aEresch that the men have expressed themselves highly satisfIed with their service, andi so far from that repreentation which was made some months ag-o about mnany of them leaving their service being true,Iam glad to say that only one mnan has been found throughout the whole of these stationsi to have left the service. We have entered 800 men from the nsvy into the coastguardservice during the last yer, the greater number (about two-thirds) of themhaving besspetty officers The rest of the men had served in the navy not less that five years, and had good chmaraters from their commaanding officers. These, therefore, will be the very heat description of men in time of war, and I have every reason to suppose that as the system is graduay extended round the &aosts of England we shall e able to form a reserve to the full extent that Y. have anticipated. We have, in fact, already 8,000 effective men in that service. Add to these the Royal Naval CoastguxsrdlVolunteers~, and our reserve force will be found to be placed on a very satis. fatr bss My right hon. friend (Sir J. Graham) never tdid anythijngore beneficial for the navy than when no took so actve a art in establishing these Naval Coastguard Volunteers It" was difficult durig the war to devoto the time necessary to the training ot these men, or to find i~fflcers for the purpose ; but the House will he gratified toD learn that most satisfactory raports have this morning been received from two of the stations -where these volunteers ar placed. I shall read short extracts from these reports. The first, from Captain Rasidolph, of the Cornwallis, at Hull, says,- '"IThe whole number assemnbled has been 71, of whom 10 have completed their period of drill and been discharged. These 10 are efficient at leading and firing both great gn and rifles with all precautions, and all have fired shot from3 6-pounder and 32-pounder, generally with remarkable precision. The progress of the remainder has been equally satisfactory for their respoective terms of drill, and it is not a little proof of the interest tak-en in it by themselves that not one complaint of inattention has ever been made by any instructor, Indeed the volunteers have expressed usiani- mously their wish to improve themselves and their satisfac- c tionx with what they have seen of the service. Captain Frazer, of the Pembroke, says:- '"By 5 p.m. on the 2d of April we had recived on beard 285 out of 301 summoned, and on the following morning they commnenced their drill in the great gun, small arm, and cutlass exercise. 1,400 rounds of ball. cartridge were also fired at 200 yards range, and the practice was nearly as good as that of our marines, The conduct of the whole party was, throughout the time they were on board, most exemplaryI. Not a single complaint was made from or of them, and they left the ship, I may almost say, with regret. By 4 p.m. on the 2d inistant we ha,d received on board 252 out of 284 summoned. As far as I have experienced I may safely say the general conduct and good feeling shown by the volunteers could n-ot possibly he more satisfactory or encouraingr." (Hear, hear.) We have not had time to ascertain fuly the resmltasat all the stations, but I have no hesitation in saying that if this system be carried n on tas beenbegnwe shal O long have organized a body of men who, accustomed to a sea life and trained to the use both of great guns and small arms, will on any emergency that may occur he of the meet essential service in the defence of their country. (Hear, hear.) I do not know that I need say more as to the number of men; I trust that tke statement I have mnade both with regard to men on active service and the reserves has boeen such as to justify the expectation that the navy wil be mnaintaied in a state of becoming efficiency and vigour. ([fear.) I shall now refer to the subject of the docks, including material building repairing, and equi1pping. The extra men aniplo ediniedck uigthe war have been almost entirely dicagdanthesblhm t, with the exception of thefcoiswchaeirain da a[ter dayare nowben reduced towhthyweebfr the war. With regard to the class of sista uh oh built I knlow there is considerabledierneoopin among ravel critics Some officersarfolrg A an others are for building nothing but saloe,M is that at s ncesarywe hould buildacrinume of both. We have during the war built a large number ofth smaller description of vessels for service in shallow water, and I am happy to say that they are very efficient for any desription of duty within reach of shoro. They caunot carry stores to any great distance, and are not calculated for cruising, or capable of going out to sea, but for service near the shore no description of vessels can be more efficient than they are, Nevertheless, it would be unwise not to continue building a certain number of s-hiPs Of a large sise. We must look to whakt other nations are doing in this respect. (Hear, bear.) No officer would think it possible or safe to meetsa line-of-battle slaP in the Atlantic with one of those gunboats. (Hear, bear. The French are building large and more powerful line-of-battle ships than ourselves; the United States also are building chips and frigates larger than any we have. (Hea'r, hear.) I willnot say whether they are likely to succeed inatheir mnodels and designs, or whether they will in reality be as powerful vessels na they lare sad to be by the Amiericans themselves; but, at all events, we ought not to he left withouLt the means of mneeting such vessels, should the necessity of doing so ever unfortunately arise. (Hear, hear.) Gentlemen may, perhaps, like to have a stmatemntOf the number of ships possesed by us in former times coprd with others, ThatlIam able to supply, at least wit regard to our nearest neighbours, the Frech ; and I am sure it willibe the wish of the House that we should havoeat all times a much more powerful navy than any other nation of the world. (Hear, hear,) We may not be able to be superior to them all, but, at any rate, unless we are pre- pared. to descend from the high position we hiave hitherto held as the first naval -Power in the world, we should be superior to any one nation in regard to the numbers and power of our ships. (Hear, hear.) The followin is a comparison of the numbers of English and French hips of the line :-In 1793 115 English and 76 French; in 1817 131 English and 72 Freneh ; in 1840 5:1 English and 46 French; in 1857 42 English aorew and 40 French sorew. With regard to frigates the comparisonwas, -In 1817 192 English and 46 French;- in 1840 110 English and 91 French; aLn 1857 42 English (screw) and 37 Frenchx (screw). The numbers beforel1857 are sailing, &o.; inl857only steam, With regard to American frigates we have nothing equal in point of suse to theNiagara, or to such Amaerican corvettes as the Merrimac. We have nothing of that description in existence, I will not give an opinion as to whether such vessels are really 2nacess or not, but it is clear that we should not be without tem when they are possessed by other nations, and therefore I have ordered one or two of this description of vessels to be built. (Hear, beer.) We hope to improve upon the vessels they have built, Itis, perhaps,not desirable to build very largeoones,, hut it would b manifestly improper not to keep up our relative position with other countries, Now, the Hlous, in order to do this, must he prepared to incur expense. The expense of a steam fleet is necessarily much greater than that of a sailing fleet, Everybody knows how great the cost of our mercantile navy is; and, of course the yessels of the navy are, many of them, much larger, Iwillv the House a comparison of the cost of three diferent kin, of sailingadsrwsi.

I have returns with mes, from whichl could quote if necessary, which prove that the numnber of accidents to steamersa in the Quee' service is infinitely less than those which occur in the mr rhant service. For instance, out of 326 Government steamers employecld drn the last five years only 23 have muet with accidents ; while out of 297 steamers belonging to private firms employed by us as trnsports during 15 moniths of the Crimean war 46 were fined for delAys caused by accidents. Perhaps I maybe permitted;to allude to a statement made by an hon. member the other night as to the screw of the Urgent having been broken and bhving knocked away one of the iron plates in her bottom,s which I could not answer then, but which I am now able to pronounce to be an entire fabrication.

L6OZ4O, TUESDAY Af Y l9, 1857.. In the House of Lords last night, The LoRD CAhciLon read a Message from Em AJEsTY, announcing thab a marriage had been =egotiated between the PRUCESS ROYAL and Prince 1'REDXBICK WmIxAM of Prussia. Eart GRANViLLE proposed an Address to Hzn MAJEsTy, expressing the affectionate actacbment of ,the House to HER MAaAEvT, their sense of the mnerits of her Royal Highness, and their regard to the dignity of the Royal Family and the honour of the country. This loyal address, after a few observations from the E3arl of DIrBy, was unanimously agreed to. The LORD CeORRC AR moved the second reading of the Probates and Letters of Administration Bill cnd proceeded to state the alterations made in the aeasure slae it was broVght forward last session. in the first place, he proposed thatthe present judge of the Prer.gative Court rhould be the firat judge of the new Court of Probate, with a w nrking salary of 4,0001.and aretiring salary of 2,000L. a-year. -As under 'the new BSill- all disputed matters of fact would b3tried by a jury ia the commrno lawcFogrtthe laboura of the Court would be much reduced; he therefore proposed that the judge of the Court of P'robate should be the juidge of the Matrimonial and Divorce Courts, and that ultimately wheuever a vacancy occuarred in the Court of Admiralty he should be judge in that court also. On tbis point he was fortified by the opinion of Dr. LusuiNGTON, who bad recently repeated evidence which be had given 20 years ago, to the effect that the duties of aU these courts might be very well discharged by one and the samejjudge. All the proceedings before the new Conurt of Probate were to be vivO tvoce ; and in cases of wills, where the property disposed of did not exceed 2001. per,onalty, or S001. realty, the judges of the County Courts were to have jurisdiction. District registrars, if the testator died within the limits of the district, were to have jurisdiction if the property bequeathed did not exceed 1,5001. The originals of wills proved in these districts would be kept in the country registry, but copies would be sent to the chief registry in London, and in the Probate-office in London there would be a department where testators might deposit their wiUs so that their relatives might know where to look for wills supposed to be in existence. The present Bill did not propose to establish a probate for real property, and the right of appeal would be to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Certain officials who might be deprived of emoluments by the Bill would be compensated, and the whole business of the new Court of Probate would be left in the hands of the Proctors. The noble lord concluded by moving the second reading of the Bill. After some observations from the Bishop of BEN, GOR, The Bishop of LoNDoN trusted that the claims of the existing ecclesiastical registrars and Chancellors would be considered in committee. Lord CA3IPBELL gave his cordial consent to the Bill, especially as all approach to the Court of Chancery was now avoided. Some otber business was then despatched, after which their lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, Lord PALMneToN brought down a Message from the QuEEN, announcing to the House that Hsa MAJESTy had consented to a marriage between the Piincess Royal and Prince FiEDEBicsC WrLuTA of PRUSSIA, and asking the concurrence and the assistance of the House in making such a provision for her eldest daughter with regard to the marriage as would be suitable to the dignity of the Royal Family and the honour of the country. The Message having been read, Lord PALUEatSToN moved an Address, thanking HlERE AJESTY for the communication, expressing satisfaction at the proposed alliance, aud assuring HEn MAJESTY that the House would immediately proceed to consider the Message. The motion was seconded by Mr. DisnABis, and agreed to nem. con. On the motion of Lord PALMJERSTON, HER MAJESTY'S Message was ordered to be taken into consideration on Friday. On the order for going into Committee of Supply, Colonel NoRTs adverted to a speech made a short time ago by Mr. W. WiLLiSAx to his constituents, in which, he said, an attack had been made upon the army, and a stigma cast upon its officers, and he appealed to the number of officers who had been killed, wounded, and invalided in the Crimea as some evidence that the disparaging remarks of Mr. WILITIANS were unfounded. Mr. W. WiLLTAms denied that he had ever expressed any opinion disparaging to the courage oF the army, from the highest to the lowest officers and soldiers, and, with respect to the reg-imental officers, he had, he said, recognized not only their courage and gallantry, but their ability. Sir W. CODRIXGToN referred to the letter signed "A Staff Officer," which appeared in this journal, which, he said, cast au unjust imputation upon the courage and conduct of General AsBsuRxNAa, and read letters from eye-witnesses bearing strong testimony to the gallantry and coolness of that officer on the day of Sobraon. The House then went into committee on the navy estimates. Sir C. WOOD, previous to moving these estimates, explained that they were the same as those he had submitted to the late Parliament; but he had only taken for the money votes sums on account (amounting to 3,390,0001.), and there remained votes to complete the estimates for the year amounting to 9,074,2321. In moving the votes on account it had been thought better, he observed, to defer his general statement as to the condition of the navy and the several items until the remaining votes were brought forward. The estimates had been fully considered in the early part of the year, and nothing had occurred to alter them; for, with reference to naval purposes, it would not be necessary to ask for any additional vote on account of the war with China; the only further demand would be in regard to the transport of troops. He called attention to the extent of the reductions made even upon the reduced estimates of last year. Economy, he said, had been carried as far as the exigencies of the country justified, but no farther; for he reminded the House that the late war had warned us of the dangerous error of leaving the country without adequate preparation for such a contingency. He then entered upon copious and detailed explanations with reference to the separate votes, concluding by moving that 53,700 men-seamen, marines, and coastguard-be granted for the remaining eight months. This vote was agreed to, after a discussion of some length. The following votes, to complete the Estimates, were likewise agreed to, after discumion 1,349,3331. for wages of the men. 533,9221. for their victuals. 84,2171. for the Admiralty-offlce. 118,1501. for salaries of the Coastguard and Volunteers. 33,0911. for the scientific branch. 92,2241. for establishments at home. 15,4231. for establishments abroad. 584,3901. for wages of artificers at home. 33,3831. for the same abroad. 895,4501. for naval stores and steam machinery. 378,4151. for new works. 20,0001. for medicines. The CHAIRmAN was then ordered to report progress. The Bankruptcy and Tnsolvency (Ireland) Bill was read a second time; and the House went into committee upon the slaries, pensions, &c., under the Bill, vrhich gave rise to a short discussion. The remaining business having heen disposed of, the House adjourned at 20 minutes after 1 o'clock.
The English people will heartily respond to the intimation of the QuEsN's desire that a suitable provision should be made for the PnsNcEss RovA on the occasion of her approaching marriage with the Prince of PRUSSiA. The Message from the CROwN was delivered last night by Lord GnANxrm. I to the Peers, and by Lord PAIMERSTON to the Commons. In the Upper House Lord DERRY, in the Lowerx Mr. DisRazLR, as the prescriptive leaders of the Opposition, heartily and gracefully'secnded the proposal. 'Th6 feeling in either House was.sufflciently declared to show that on Friday next, when :the business is 'to be Apecifically cimhiderodj there wiul be no.diAay 4f a niggard .and churlish spirit. The matter is one which must be of deep.personal interest'to he' Royal' lady who has discharged the duties of 'her pre-eminent station in so exemp]ary a manner, and in - that spirit it 'rill be entertained by the representatives of her people. -When we look back upon certain discreditable passages in the laxt three reigns connected with the discharge of private debts which ought never to have been incurred, and with extravagant provisions made for younger members of a numerous family, it is pleasant to approach anything so worthy of respect a. the private chronicles of the present Royal Faui of England. In place of holding the foremnos!t position in the country, had they occupied - a private statioan their admirable conduct w.ould have entitled them to universal respect. It is genera)ly m- derstood that the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall have been so well managed that they will constitute an ample pro.vision for' the Plince of YAniwa .without tfae.urtemaity for auy fresh appl1 cation to Pariia'aent. The Duchy of Lancaster mw leen handled in thesameway, andthe income arising from this source is, it in said, destined to make provision for the younger Princes as each attains a proper age. We cannot but remember that both GEORBGE IV. and WILmAm IV. contrived to expend the revenues of these two Duchies in addition to their regular Civil List, although there was not a Prince of WALES extant in the days of either of them. Again, the Quaml has purchased Bahnoral and Osborne-the seats where she principally resides-out of her own private income, Iwithout putting the nation to one farthing of expense. These points ought to be considered when such a Message as the one which was delivered last night in either House of Parliament is under consideration. It should be remembered that the good done by Royal " respec" tability'-we use the word in its highest sease -is not confined to this,-thUt the people are not plundered from time to time to satisfy the clamorous demands of creditors; but the keynote which is struck from above rings throughout the nation. Queen VIcTorA has put profligate expenditure out of fashion. She does not take advantage of her exalted station to trample the ordinary laws of morality and probity under foot. When the Sovrmaso of this vast empire esteems it a sacred duty not to owe any man anything, lesser people may make up their minds to follow in her train. With regard to the specific grant which will be proposed, it would be ungraceful were we to discuss it here. Thus mnuch, however, we may venture without offence to say, that the wildest and most unfounded rtumours have prevailed as to the amount of what is expected, or what is necessary. If we say that in all probability the sum which has been mentioned as revenue is not much less than the capital sum which will be proposed, we shall not be leading the public far astray. For every reason, we trust that the plan of paying a good amount down once for all may be adopted, in place of throwing a life-charge upon the public. This would be but to keop up heartburns in times of discontent and scarcity. It would be irksome to the people of England,-it would be a humiliation to the Crown of PRUSSIA that it should be treated as the pensioner of a foreign Power. Let lus pay the dowry down. That is the proposition which will find most favour in the eyes of the country. It is such an one as will be entertained with that cordial and loyal spirit which we are very sure will always characterize the English people in any matter which affects the personal happiness of their QuEFIi.
" The Urgent," says her Commander, " is a "strong and well-built ship, and fit for the service "in which she is employed. She is remarkably "stiff, and sails uncommonly well with her present "establishment of masts, yards, and sails. She "stays well, is lively and buoyant, and a good sea "boat; bIut takes time and space to wear in." That happens to be a very fair account, perhaps we might say of the British people and character, but certainly of the department to which this report was made, and particularly of the right hon. gentleman at the head of it, and the quoter of these words. Undoubtedly, in naval, as in many other affairs, England "takes time and " space to wear iu." Force of habit is very strong in us. Notwithstanding the novelty of our institutions, compared with those of the world at large, we are as obstinate as the rest of the world on certain points affecting our national vanity. Now., if there is one thing that England is proud of, it is her wooden waUs, her floating castles, her huge three-deckers, with which she is sup. posed to have beaten al other Powers off the ocean. We cannot raise very great armies; we have no line of fortresses to keep under perpetual garrison, but we can launch monsters on the deep, stronger than fortresses, teeming with battalions. This, therefore, we must do. This is our vocation; this, then, is the burden of the annual addiezs made by that fortunato man who directs and represents the naval prowess of this country. He must conduct before our eyes a magnificent procession of screw liners, larger and more numerous, better in steam and in guns, than those of any rival. He must fight all our battles, not only over again, but before they come. The grandeat arena alone will suffice. It is in the middle of the Atlantic that this mighty and powerful, though still imaginary atruggle, must be decided. There, with plenty of sea room, a thousand miles from shoal and from anchorage, our huge liners and frigates are annually to meet an equal number of well-matched antagonists, and the First Lord of the Admiralty is to assure us of the inevitable result. We are always to be perfectly able to meet midway between the Old and New World, or midway in the British Channel or the German Ocean, all the power that America, or France, or Russia, might ever hope to bring against us. " Always prepared" is our motto, and we are never to throw off our cumbrous panoply of three-deckers. We have heard these exhortations every year, we are afraid to remember how long. They are as old as " GOD " save the QuEEM " and " Rule Britannia." No doubt England, on the -whole, keeps up her character and holds her place on sea or land. But, like the unlucky Urgent, she " takes time and " space to wear in." She goes blundering on, and, though she comes right at last, it is not till after a great deal of loss, trouble, and disgrace, through that national obstinacy of which she is so perversely proud. Why, barring a half-sentence and a word or two here or there, Sir CFSwrL WOOD'S speech last night might have been spoken any time these forty years. Granting that England must always be England, that the navy must always be the navy-in other words, that there are certain conditions that are invariable-yet, it is a matter of plain common sense that a statement of our naval preparations for the current year ought to have a marked reference to the naval oocasions of the current year. Whatever collision we may expect some day with our present faithful ally the Emperor of the FRneNC, with that other EmpLrop, whom we have lately brought to hard terms, and whose brother is'now expected at our.Court; or with our cousins aerow the Atlantie,'these are at least prospective and high speculative' danger. But it is a matter o4 fact present aiid rather wgenti that we are engaged -in a qiairrel with (!bnm wvhiih wiU have.to . h-. fQught out, no0 wvit liners, or frigates, or even eotvetes, or in the open sea at aU, but with gunboats in livers and ceeks. H'ere arezaval ofileera sendinghome sketches appealing to our. feelings and common sense, renseenting steaaers puring fleets of junks and groundlg in ten ertwelve feet of water, leaving the work to be do"e by boats drawing esly six or eight. Exactly as it was three years ago, the cry is for small crafL All the accounts Mhierto have been full of groundings, and the di1ticulties arnsmg from the danger of grounding. Vessels hive had to be moved down where they cojuld do nothing, or where they were exposed to anoyance, simply becaus their draught 'ws such as to neutralize the power of steam, and deprive them of the power of choosing their owri position. Now, in tli3 state of things bad S;r CRanxss told the House that he had foundl it necessary to send to China 30 out of the 100( g%aboats re6iewed at the close of the last was, 4le'' iwould 35o&bave been a murmur at the nVen-at Jeaat not a murmur worth avenft , to. iP appears that befokQ tbk a5b the Admiralty had fortunately sent seven or eight gunboats to China in search of pirates, and Sir CHARLES talks of eleven gunboats, sent, we presume, especially to assist Lord ELG's negotiations. But, as Sir CHARLES also observes, truly enough, that steam-vessels are much more liable to get out of repair than sailing vessels, and that to secure a given amount of efficiency at a given point it is necemsary to have more of the former than of the latter, and as China is a voyage of fifteen thousand miles from our Dockyards and ironworks, we think his own calculation might have suggested a greater total number of gunboats than eighteen or nineteen, which is the most that we can make out from his statement. Whatever office our large ships might have to perform in this affair, as convoys, as depBts, or as rallying points, it is evident that the brunt must be borne by those very gunboats of which we did at last get enough by the end of the late war. We all remember with what despatch they were finished at last, even only for a review, and what complaints arose from some quarters at the cost of a mere spectacle. Wo all remember, too, the curious question which arose as to the disposal of the flotilla in the long peace that was to folow. Something was even said about the Caledonian Canal being available for the purpose. But of the hundred new boatz, with all sorts of interesting names, a score is the very outside that has been sent, where they are evidently wanted and waited for. The last eleven sent to China have to run the risks of a voyage through two oceans round half the world, risks of wind, wave, and steam; and we shall be agreeably surprised to hear that six of them arrive in good time and in condition for work. If the prospect is better than we suppose, if there really is a fair hope of a serviceable flotilla of the only serviceable craft numerous enough to operate on three thousand miles of coast, at half-a-dozen different points, upon as many cities, islands, and rivers, then Sir CHARaLES 1YOOD would have supplied to his Naval Estimates the interest they lack, by giving us this useful information. In fact, that is the very thing we miss in his statement. We miss its application to the present year. It is a remainder not only from the last abortive Session, but altogether from the recess of 1856. Excepting just the mention of these eleven gunboats, and the increased expenditure for the conveyance and lodging of troops, Sir CHAaLES gives us no account of an expedition as important as any that ever sailed from this country; as important, possibly, in its results as that with which CoLaBrus chased the setting sun, and not without its share of difficulties and dangers. N'othing could have been easier than to inform the Hlouse what force, and what vessels of all kinds, have been sent to China. That is that precise thing which we aU want to know; and, were the force evidently unequal to any substantial results, Parliament would have had the opportunity, and certainly the will, to sanction a larger and more effective armament.
Events which are now taking place in India carry us back to the days of CORNWALLIS and WELLESIEY. At a time when the electric telegraph has been extended over the whole breadth of the laud-when the railway train is rushing through the jungle, rousing the tiger from his lair, and scaring the vulture into flight-when a postage cheaper than that of England is disseminating intelligence from the Punjab to Ceylon, we learn the startling news that a regiment has been disbanded,. hardly without bloodshed, through the action of a superstition which was described and derided in days that we call antiquity. Why, indeed, should Hindostan or Hindoos change in accordance with what is considered the march of mind? Surely we have enough -of paradox, enough of mingled science and superstition, strength and dotage, in the world nearer home. If the King of NArLEs receives by electric telegraph the news of the melting of Sr. JANUARIuS' blood, why should not these enrolled Asiatic villagers revolt because the cartridge of the last invented rifle offends their creed of many thousand years? The world will rest on the elephant, and the elephant on the tortoise, during several generations longer for these poor men and their fellows. It remains, therefore, that we, the rulers of the country, should take precautions against the recurrence of these outbreaks of fanaticism. Such a danger as the revolt of 5,000 armed men in a district where only a single European regiment -was quartered is a sufficient warning to the most secure Government, a suficient reminder of mortality to the most triumphant power. On the 31st of March the 19th Native Infantry was disbanded at Barrackpore. The prompt measures which the Government thought necessary to adopt will be found described in another column. The 19th Regiment was in open mutiny, the 34th was in league with it, the 2d Grenadiers were sympathetic. Not less than 5,000 men were in a state of obstinate fanaticism, which any incident might change to fury. Calcutta itself might not be safe from the attack or the example of the mutineers. In these circumstances a strong force of English troops and wellaffected natives were despatched to the scene of disorder. The two Quxs-'s regiments with the cavahly and artillery occupied one side, the naf.ve regiments the other, and the 19th Native Infantry, the mutinous corps, were in the midst. A proclamation was read, and they were told they must lay down their arms. They were disposed to resist, but the preparations and firmness of MajorGeneral EArssEy, the officer in command, and himself a native of India, thoroughly cowed them. They yielded, piled their arms, and were marched off. After a certain time they were allowed to disperse to their homes. Officers and men lose all claim to the usual pension for military service, and, in a worldly point of view, the unhappy men have dearly expiated their obstinacy and folly. But so deeply rooted are these superstitions of centuries, so widespread is the fear that the supremacy of the Company means danger to the hereditary faith, that the mutinLous spirit has spread beyond the limi{s of the garrison. It is thought that the :34th, must ,be disbanded,-and a- native regiment at iDinapore- is only held imcheck .by tie presence of English- troops. Shouldit prove that the wbrst 1sovei; ancl that trafiquillitjy.hal been restored, without bloodshed, w-e may will be satisfied with the result. The mutiny at Vellore hlf a centrty ago shook. the power of the Madras Government, ard was only put, down by a great n6rifice of life. But at this very station of Barrackpore there is one instance in inore recent times of a terrible commotion quelled only by a most lameatable Blaughter. The cause was- much less sereus than in the present case, for now religious passions are roused; then the only question was oee of discipline, the sepoys having refused to mal3 when ordered. A great part of- three regine declared their determination not to obey. "Things grew serious, the Commander-in-Chief was sent for, and- appeared wifth two Europea 'regimenta and a strong force of artillery. Tia mutineeis were ordere?, to lay down their arms. They answered that f1ey had sworn not to TiMld. The measures of the, authorities were prornp Two signal guns wJ:re fired, and the rj'llery instantly opened on. the rebellious troops. A number wee hot " 6formed in the attempt to crosm the rive; se, ~A we Wt*euaU(dexeouted, and the mutiny was crushed by the strong arm of military power. We trust and believe that no such terrible severity will be necessary in the preaent day; for, tbough the Hindoo may not have much changed, the power of the British Government has been consolidated and secured, so that mercy may be shown without imprudence. When the Burmnese were powerful enemies, the Mahratta Chieftains not yet finally ouppressed; when the protected States still gave themselves airs of independence, and on the north-west the kingdom of RUNJEEr SXGn Hwas formidable, there might be some fear that the mutiny of even a single regiment would seriously and permanently embarrass the Government. But now that the whole of India has been thoroughly subdued, and that from Affgbanistan to the borders of Siam there is no Power which even aspires to oppose us, we may be humaane while we are politic, and be content to punish disobedience by loss of pay and pension, without a resort to artillery or a charge of the bayonet. It is reassuring, moreover, that the Mussulman, the Sikh, the Ghoorka, has no share in the prejudices of the Hindoo. The Government may always count on the votaries of Islam for support in any tumult arising from the teaching of an idolatrous creed. Still we could wish to see a larger number of European troops at hand on such an occasion. Our Indian Empire is not what it was, and yet the number of white regiments remains pretty nearly stationary. vithin the last 15 years we have annexed Scinde and the Punjab and Pegu, not to speak of Oude and half-a-dozen protected or tributary districts. The cares and duties of the army are therefore largely increased. Although the European force is costly and sickly-although every man sent out is said to cost 1001., and many are only sent out to be laid, before long, in the barrack cemetery, yet we must not shrink from the duties which our situation necessitates. We have conquered India by British hands, and by them it must be retained. Nothing will render the improvement of the country so difficult, nothing will so unsettle the minds of a people easy to be impresse, and likely to find evil advisers to impress them, as the suspicion that there is any 'weakness in us. The belief that on any point, whether 10 miles or 1,000 miles away, the authority of England can be overthrown for a day by Asiatics of any race or creed will go far to nullify all our character of auperiority aid all the authority of civilization. Economy will be in the end its own enemy, for a Power which, like our own, depends on reputation has to make threefold display after any appearance of being worsted. Suppose a station with only one or two companies of Europeans in presence of several thousand maddened Hindoos,suppose a slaughter of British officers, the destruction of a barrack, the dispersion of several native regiments to their own homes, outrages committed far and wide, and the news flying in the usual Asiatic manner across provinces and kingdoms to the heart of Tartary and China; how long a time, how great an outlay, and how many brilliant achievements might it not take to efface the impression made on all those millions of men I British power can never afford to be suspected, and least of all in India.
A Bill just introduced by the Marquis of BLANDrorD, "to provide for the mode of securing the 6Incomes of Ecclesiastical Corporations, Aggregate "and Sole," is apparently founded upon the recommendations of the Select Committee of the House of Commons which sat upon this subject last year. The BiU is a compromise, as, indeed, an our legislation on this subject for the last quarter of a century has been. Our Church Reformers have for the last quarter of a century been pushing the principle of fixed episcopal incomes, and this principle has been so far accepted by the Legislature that an Act of 20 years back-viz., 6 and 7 Winr.A, IV., cap. 77, actually names certain incomes as attached to certain sees, so that al the world was under the idea that the law of theland had actually fixed the incomes of our Bishops thenceforward. The Durham expos6 dissipated this delusion, and it then appeared that the phrase " annual incom@' had in the Act been diluted into the phrase "average annual in"C ome" -a loose expression which, of course, defeated accuracy, and left room for an arrangement by which the Bishop of any see might retain all the estates of the see, paying to the Ecclesiastical Commission annuaUy such a sum as, in the opinion of the Commissioners, would leave him, upon an average of years, about the annual income nanied in the Act. This was a very odd form of "annual incomd' and a very roundabout way of executing the prominent design of the Act. It led, in fact, to the total frustration of the professed design of the Act. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners could not possibly tell what might be made out of the episcopal estate thus left in the hands of the Bishop, and it turned out that the income of the late Bishop of Durham had exceeded by some thousands a-year the sum named in the Act as the income of his bishopric. This was a scandalous result, but it is only fair to say that the dishonesty attached to the system rather than to the man. The legislation was dishonest, because it pretended to do one thing and it did another. It paraded fixed incomes in large letters before the eyes of the public, while the actual arrangement which it instituted left the episcopal income a fluctuating one, as before, depending upon rents, fines, &c. ; and the dishonesty of the legislation was the result of the compromise upon which it was founded-a compromise which it was impossible to carry out without these dishonest results, though there was no pecuniary dishonesty in the desiga of the compromise itself. The Reformers wanted fixed incomes, i.e.,-for their plan eame necessarily to this-annual stipends. The Church did not like the idea of stipends. She wanted the estates to be retained in the Bishop hands, as a nmatter of ecclesiastical dignity as wel1 as greater apparent security. The result was an agreement that the episopal incomes soulcld be as fine6 a -was poesible compatibly with the maintnance of 'the system of episcopal landlords and the terri6oriel dignity of the Bench ; ipi aecordance, with, whic'h-e esiastical Commis made, -low a ges as theycould with respect to the annual valu, of an episcopal estate, and1 acicding. aas-in their estimate it exceeded or Filr ainrtz of &t apponted- iehiome of the see, rewived aX certain aniu.s Mini fresia the ishop, or paid one io him, T he lBill, before ~.keeap up .tbia coanpaomse, putting it.into and6her shape, which does not much improve upoa ie old ore. The iees -are- all to give up their preeent estate to the Ecclesiastica3. Commission, and to receive fresh ones from the gommissioa in retumn. It will be an anxious moment indeed for eaeh see-the moment of dhvosessioa-when, having just' handed over aU its old property to the Commission, it -waits for repayment. The short interval of vacuum WM le a nervous one, and the ve3sel will sit uineasily on the sand, P it waits for the return of the tide, The ebb and flow of landed property is an anxious process, because that dignified and solid material is hardly- made for this sort of game, any more thau Pelion and Ossa were-for the gam.e of battledore and shuttle-cock between the acientt giants. - HIowever, the State is hones.t, and, if it promise reato- tionu will ut doubt be ea goqd a it. wod. 1 But we mu5t ftnuEy confess that this is about as extraordinary an arrangement as we ever heard of -all the estates of the Bishops, and Deans, and Chapters taken, away and new ones given to them, alnd for what purpose ? For a complete settlement and clearance of' di9iculties? 3For nothing of the sort. All this volcanic change, this vast diluvina metamorphosis and territorial transposition, is to, found a system very like the present one, open t1o. almost exactly the s3me objections, and in some respects to worse. It is supposed, perhaps, that the new estates, being free from the shackles of the lessee system and let upon rackrent, will be susceptible of a more accurate estimate than the present ones, andE that the approach to the sum named by the law, as the income of the see will be nearer than it is on . the present systcm; but, do what you may, and: make the very best guess you can, you. cannot ascertain the annual rent of a lauded estate so a(curately as to be able to say that it coincides' with a certain exact annual sum. Still less can you prophesy what the annual rent of a particilar estate will be years hence. It is true the Bill before us guards to a certain extent against fluctuation and change; it gives power to the Ecclesiastical Commission to inspect 'he estate of each see upon the death or trausla-. tion of the Bishop, -re-estimate it, reduce'it should its annual rental have increased, and add a to it should its rental have diminished. This is to - some extent a safeguard againt irregularity, but' a moderately long episcopal reign will still give opportunity for a considerable change in the rental of an estate. The system, again, of rackrent is undoubtedly a much fairer one than the lessee system ; but there,' is one drawback upon it-it occupies the land- lurd's time and attention more than the latter. system. Under the lessee system the les5ee is the virtual proprietor of the land, and the: landlord has, in fact, hardly anything to do with his own property but receive certain fines at certain times. The lessee takes the burden of repairs, enlargements and additions of buildings,: improvements, drainage, &c., upon himself. Under; the rackrent system these claims fall upon the landlord, who has therefore to be always looking after his property. In these days we are rather jealous of such claims upon episcopal time an.:, attention. It is true the Bill before us gives the Bishop the option of putting his estate under the management of the EcclesiasticaiC Commission, but this is coupled with the condition' that in that case the Commission will receive the, rents, and pay the Bishop the Parliamentary income of his see. Some Bishops will not be disposed to accept this offer upon such a condition ; they will prefer taking the estates under their own management, wvith the chance of making more than their Parliamentary income out of them, or they will like the importance of landlords, of which the transference of the land to the management of the Commission would virtualy deprive them; or-' they will like the business itself of looking after their land. We shall therefore have some episcopal estates under the management of the Com- mission and others under the management of the: Bishops. What, then, is the great difference between the. new system as proposed in this Bill and the exist-: ing one, and what is the great gain from all this. transposition of property? Very little, if any.- You have an irregular, loose, anomalous system under this new Bill, just as you have now-a. system that requires constant looking after, that in; always on the point of going wrong, and just saved, by the Ecclesiastical Commission coming in like an.: interposing deity to keep things straight. The, Commission will, in fact, not be able to keep things, straight; there will be constant jars, scandals coming out, and excesses of episcopal incomes over: the Parliamentary limif, which will excite attentiom and injure the Church. If you make any decided cbange upon the present system there is but one. change that you can make, and that is relievin' the Bishops of the charge of landed property altogether and giving them fixed incomes out ofa fund. To this we must come at last. It is theL only just and reasonable settlement, and measure&like the present one simply make a vast fuss with-- out really doing anything.

FORBIGN INTELLIGENBC. 1%kCANU J. [A porton of the folowing appeored in our second edi- . of vesterdasv:-1 (mOB?M OVJX OWN CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, SuNDAY, MAY 17, 6 P.M. The Mordteur publishes a despatch from Conatantinople of the 16thinst., announcing that the Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and Persia was ratified at Teheran on the 14th April, and despatched to Bagdad on the 17th of the aame month. The Russian organ, the Nord, positively announced some days ago that the Shah had refused to sign the treaty. I stated that no intelligence of a trustworthy kind had been received by the French Governmnent to corroborate that statement, but rather the contrary. The Nord repeated its assertion, was again contradicted, and again persisted. Its intelligence was, of cours, derived from St. Petersburg. It is not the fault of the Nord and its patrons if the treaty was not ratified, and we are ready to take the will for the deed. There are, I believe, but three Powers who have representatives at Teheran-namely, France, Rumsia, and Turkey. I am assured that the French and Turkish Ministers simultaneously insisted on the Shah's ratifying the treaty; and that the French Minister was particularly charged by his Government to tell the Shah that in doing so he might rely on the friendship of the Emperor Napoleon. I aluded at the time to the good offices of the French Government, and the friendly assistance of the Emperor during the negotiations in Paris which preceded the treaty, and I feel pleasure in now stating, what I believe to be true, that they have been followed up, at the Emperor's desire, byhis Minister at Teheran. A letter from Bologna, of the 12th inst., states that the tour which the Pope is making in his States continues to excite much interest. On the morning of the 11th his Holiness set out for Camerino. Great preparations were making at Sinigaglia to receive him. Sinigaglia is the native town of Pius 1x., and otherwise is not without its claim to historic interest. It was, I believe, the first colony theRomans established beyondtheApennines, nearly 300 years before the Christian era, and it was at Seas Gallica (its ancient name) that Asdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, was defeated and slain by the oRoman generals. The Pope will take up his residence in the old mansion of his family the Mastas, but, in order that the honour shall be hared by the mnunicipality, a temporary bridge is being constracted between that mansion andjthe Town-house,which is at the other side of the small stream, the Cezano, or Sena. According to all accounts, he will be warmly velcomed in his native place. He will then proceed to Ravenna, and from Ravenna to iBologna. From the preparations going on atBologna, offices and *aparments being got ready for carrying on the business of the Government, it would look as if the Pope really contemplated passing some time ihere. Indeed, private letters say that he will not return to Rome before the end of September. The people of the provinces seem convinced that the object of his journey is to examine in person their condition, and ascertain their wants and wishes, with the view of decreeing at Bologna the reforms which he may consider the most urgent. The consequence is, that his Holiness is well reeeived throughout. I must, however, repeat that there are others who believe the Pope apprehends that an ouGbreak is not impossible at Naples, that it would be followed up at Rome, and, in the uncertainty as to how the French army would act, he is anxious to get as near the Austrians as possible. All this, however. is as yet but mere conjecture. at Bologna His Holiness will be visited by the Princes of the smaller States, and the representatives of the King of Piedmont, and, perhaps, of Naples; and it is not improbable that the state of the Italian Peninsula will be considered by them. From the unusual circumstance of the floly Father leaving his capital at this time of the year it is imagined that the cause must be more than an ordinary one. The Empress Dowager of Russia is expected at Turin in the course of this month. Preparations are heing made to give HEr Majesty a brilliant receptton. The Emperor, attended by General MontebeUo, came into town yesterday in order to pay a visit to M. Vielard, the Senator, who is dangerously ill. M.. VieUard is one of his oldest friends, and was, I believe, formerly his tutor. The Emperor profited by the occasion to bid farewell again to the Grand Duke Coustantine, after the more ceremonious adie= of Fontainebleau. The gentility of the Parie and the AssemblNe Nationae is offended at the thought of the Grand Duke condescending to amuse himself as a private gentleman during his two days' incog?ito in Paris. This is being over-squeamish. These two exquisites fancy that Kings and Princes must be ever with their crowns of gold on their heads, rith breasts glittering with stars, Royal or Imperial mantles perpetually hanging from their shoulders, and that their talk can never be but in "King Cambyses' strain." That great people lo now and then relax a little the severity of state, and amuse themselves in a very homely manner, is clear from the accounts of the Villeneuve l'Etang sports described so minutely in the Word; for I presume that, as no contradiction has appeared, it is genuine, though the vein of satire in which it was written is quite transparent. Historians have recorded with admiration how the Czar Peter-quite as great a man as the Grand Duke-worked in the dockyarcds of Saardam, in Holland, and of Deptford, in England, as a common carpenter, and received his wages as such. Eis private amusements were not, I apprehend, as innocent as those suggested for the idle hours of the Grand Duke; and at say rate from the "wild sports," of Villeneuve l'Etang to the puppet-shows ofthe Champs Elysles the descent is not so very rapid. The Patrle and Asse,bnZse may have souls above Gringalet and Gugi9ol, but I hold to the opinion of Partridge in 0T-7 Jones, that there are worse ways of spending a vacant half-hour; and the Grand Duke may hear more edifying stories from Polichinele, who holds his sittings in the Champs Elys6es, than some that are current near that neighbourhood. If his Imperial Highness has not " assisted " at the performances of Guinol, the loss is his own. Be this as it may, he left last evening for Creuzot; he returns to Paris this evening, and starts for Bordeaux. He left his card yesterday at the Tarkish Embassy for the Ambassador. Besidesthe words engraved, "The Grand Duke Constantine," in his autograph and in Turkish (which it appears he speaks well) were "The Prince Constantine." It is said that the King of Bavaria is disposed to offer his good offices to bring about a reconciliation between the Western Powers and the King of Naples. Colonel Bertrand has arrived with despatches from Prince lNapoleon from Berlin. It is said that there are favourable accounts of the King of I'iussia'sdisposition inthe Nieucbhtel business. The :ing will, no doubt, haie made a merit of necessity. A0telegraphic despatch from Madrid announces that at the interview M.

By a mnedical bulletinl publishked at Buda on the evening of tho 13th inst. we learn that the little Archduchess Giella, who is teething, has had rsveral convulsive fits. She was better yesterday, but still their Majesties will re 10 days longer at Pe3th thta they originally inteded It is be lieved that the Imperial infant is already out of danger, but a wish to avoid putting his Hungariau aubjects to' any unnecesary expense and inconvem2iice induced the Emperor at once to declare that Tp htd resolved to postpone his departure until the 9;-4p 2th iust.

On the 13th of June the long tour will commence, during wvhich the principal towns in the north-west and south-west provinces of Hungary wil be visited. On the 18th of June the Emperor will come to Vienna, and be present at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Order of Maria Theresa, but he will leave again in the evening of the same day, and not return until the 10th of July. On the 11th the Emperor, by means of an autograph letter, remitted all the arrears of the war contributions imposed on the Himgarians at the end of the troubles of 1849. On the 27th of April His Majesty permitted the Hungarian refugees John Alexander Fredro, Henry Lang, Peter Kolesey, Louis Balogb, Augustus Kosztolanyi, and Joseph Halosz to return to this country, and there is no reason to doubt that all those persons who quitted Austria in order to escape punishment for political offences would, with the exception, perhaps, of half a dozen, be allowed to settle again in their homes if they made application to the foreign Ministers or Consuls for permission to do so. As the Hungarians say nothing either of the contents of their petition to the Emperor or of the reception which it met with, it must be concluded that they are not inclined to believe it will lead to the wished-for results. Prince Paul Esterhazy, who is a perfect courtier, and a very timid man withal, declined to have anything to do with the petition, to which were affixed about 200 of the best names in Hungary. According to a private letter, a temporary triumphal arch which had been erected by the inhabitants of Kecslemet, was set on fire by some ill-disposed person or persons directly after it was completed. We now learn from credible sources that Rosza Sandor was attacked by the peasant Paul Ratona, who was desirous to obtain the 10,000fl. offered by Government for the arrest of the daring bandit who for inearly6 years had set the HIungarian pandours and Austrtan police at defiance. Eatona, who is suspected of having been one of Rosza's accompliceS, struck the robber on the head with an axe as he entered his "tanya" (solitary house.) Rosza, although somewhat confused by the unexpected blow was not very severely injured, for he drew a pistoi from his pocket and fired it at his assailant, -who fell dantgerousily wounded to the ground. While the strulggle was going on between Katona and Rozam, the mistress of the house struck the latter another blow on the head from behind, and as soon as he fell to the ground she rew a heavy "bunda" (sheepsldn cloak) over him. The whole thing had probably been arranged beforehand, for persons who were m the vicinity rushed in directly after the woman gave the alarm and secured the prostrate robber. Roma, who is a square-built muscular man, did not seem at all cast down as he was transferred to the prison at Szegedin. It is said that he isto be tried byvthe civil authorities, and not by a drum-head court-martial. In a former letter it was said that 150,000persons had visited the Agriculbtral Exhibition during the first three days, but a member of the committee informs me that the Ost-Deutsche Post, from which paper the news was taken, committed the alight blunder of printing a cipher too much. On Tuesday, the day on which the Emperor visited the Exhibition, above 22,000 persons entered the garden. The specimens of timber contributed by a Siavonian and Croatian Society, by the Princes of Coburg Kohari, Lichtenstein, Schwarzenberg, and Lobkowitz, and various other nobles, are most remarkable both for size and beauty. Some of the trees from which specimens had been cut were 250, 300, and even 400 years old. An oak, hew,n square, which was sent from Slavonia, is 120 feet long, and perfectly sound and straight. Prince Lichtenstein has exhibited sections of red beech from trees containing 1,057 cubic feet of timber. Among the specimens exhibited by Prince Schwarzenberg are sounding-boards, which are sold in great numbers to the musical instrument makers in Paris and London. In the province of Lower Austria alone there are 31,000,000 acres (joch) of forest, and the total value of the wood now growing in th" Empire of Austria is estimated at 600,000,000 of florins (60,000,0001.) The majority of the English machinists are well satisfied with the orders which they have received, and the firm of Howard, of Bedford, must have sold an enormous number of ploughs and harrows. The mowing machines were tried the day before yesterday, but I do not yet know which of them was moat successful It is, however, stated that Baron Ward's machine got clogged, and did not answer the expectations of the public. The itinerary of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian has been completely changed. His Imperial Highaess will leave Milan on the let of June and proceed to Florence, where he will remain but a few hours. In the evening of the day of his arrival he will go to Leghorn, where the Austrian steam-frigate which is to take him to England will be in waiting for him. On the 20th of June the Austrian Prince wilibe in Brussels, wherehe wiU only remain aweek. Shortly before the 20th of July, on which day his marriage is to take place, he wil again go from Vienna to the capital of Belgium with his own suite and that of his future bride. Some days before the arrival of the Archduke at Bruswels, in the month of July, Count Archinto will be sent there as the Ambassador Extraordinary of the Emperor, to demand the hand of the Princess Charlotte for the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. The Sardinian papers accuse the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of an exaggerated liking for pomp and ceremony, but his magnificent establishmentat Milan is probably much more to the taste of the inhabitants of that city than to his own. When the Prince was at Trieste, he, like all the members of his family, was very simple in his habits, and it is not very likely that they have suddenly changed. The prohibition received by the Milan Crepsctulo ("Twilight'"to give political newshas producedavery bad impression in Lombardy, as itis generaUy known that the paper committed no other offence than ignoring the grossly exaggerated and often positively fulsome officIal accounts of the reception of their Majesties in Lombardy and Venice.

I lately gave you to understand by telegraph that Prince Napoleon would leave here on lFriday for Dresden; his departure was, however, hastened, and he left here on Thursday morning. At Dresden, where he arrived at 2 o'clock the same day, he was received by the Crown Prince of Saxony at the railway station, and at half-past 3 the two Princes drove out to Pilnitz to dinner. The French Minister accredited to the Court of Saxony had already come as far as Rdderau to meet the Prince. When I telegraphed to you it was understood that the Prince would remain here certainl til Thursday evening, and arrangements were mfeforhis being present at a further fieldday at Potsdam that morning, and that probably he would wait here till the.Queen of Prunia returned hither from PillnAtz. this+ appears, however, to have been suddenly changed. her Majestys visit to PMllnitz will be prolonged til the19th inst., when she is expecte biack at Potadam; and her sister, the Archduchess Sophia of Auatria, is expected to arrive at Pillnitz during her stsay there. The King, who had retiSret to Sams Souci after the departure of his French guest, comes into town again to-day, and proceeds to Tecklenburg to be present at a festival held there tmorrow to commemorate the County of Tecklenburg cOming into the poesion of the Pran Crown 150 years back. On Mlonday, on his returnathencetoPotsdam, His Majesty will proceed to Stettin to be present at the agricultural exhibition and cattleshow to be held there on the 19th. The King will return from Stettin on that day early enough to receive the Queen on her return from Dresden. Previous to the grand dinner which the Prince of Prussia gave Prince Napoleon on Wednesday last a telegraphic despatch arrived here from Paris announcing that the Emperor Louis Napoleon had conferred on his Royal flighaees the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, and the two Prusianoflicera who had been appointed to be in waiting on Priace Napoleon during his stay here have also received orders. The morning after that entertainment the Prince left Berlin to prosecute his military inspeoc tions, from which he will not return till Monday next; and towards the close of next Tartzal is a mu,e .oW in the oodnty of ZewTi. lat' the foot Of the me Ianon whiek tho Tokay wi&9 i 9wQW96 week he will also proceed to Stettin, in compliance with the invitation of that town, to be present at the Agricultural Exhibition there. Prince Carl arrived here yesterday morning on his return from Rome. The Empress of Russia is now not expected here till the middle of Jaly. Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who was prevented by military duties from cominng up to Berlin from Breslau during the visit of Prince Napoleon, is expected here in the middle of next week, and after a stay of a few days he will return to Brealau. His visit to England is put off till the month of June. Men's minds here are still occupied with cogitations as to what could have been the maision of Prince Napoleon to this Court, and the would-be clever fellows are still hammering at the comparative probabilities of the Neuchatel and the Dano-German conflicts, the Danubian Principalities, and the great Italian question having formed the subject on which the Prince's talents have been employed. As I have already informed you, I believe that neither of thosa momentous matters has at all entered his philosophy, but that the object of his visit was simply to return that of Friedrich Wilhelm, made in Paris last autumn. As regards the reason, however, why this moment was chosen for it, I am not so clear; it may have been either to get out of the Grand Duke Constantine's wayj, or to pay the visit to this Court in due form beford the moment should come when he would have to pass through on his way to St. Petersburg. Whether the Prince has connected with his visit any little matrimonial plans ofhis own, with a special eye to the Court of Saxony, a few days wil probably reveal. The impression which the Prince bas made here has, as far as I can judge, been a favourable one in the highest circles, where he took considerable pains to please; to the lower orders, too, who are always ready to greet every bearer of a wellsoundinig name and every wearer of a brilliant uniform, he has been particularly welcome; but the visit has certainly not been productive of any deep French sympathies in either Court or people, and, least of all, in the middle classes. Though the Prince had certainly no political mission here, his visit is far from being devoid of political importance; it is the first active step taken by France to remove or to soften down the asperities of feeling that historical tradition keeps alive in the bosoms of this people; and, like Prince Friedrich Wilhelm's visit to Paris, it opens up the possibility of future improved relations between the two neighbouring States. On the side of Prassia the sending of the one Prince and the receiving of the other are an overt declaration that the Holy Alliance is now entirely at an end-no longer exists, not even a deu=. The letter which the Emperor Louis Napoleon wroteto tbeKing onthe subject of the present phase of the Neuchhtel arrangement, and which Prince Napoleon was supposed to have brought hither, was received and answered before the Prince arrived here; but I have no reason to believe that the final instructions have been forwarded to Count Hatzfeldt from here. The last that I reported to you oa this matter was nearly a fortnight ago, to the effect that the King represented to the Powers composing the conference that the mere engagement of the Swiss Government that the revenues of the church property in Neuchatel should not be diverted from the purposes for which it had been demised was an insufficient guarantee, and that the restitution of the property itself to the church would be infinitely preferable, together with some objections to some other pointsof minor importance, Theperiodthat ham elapsedsincethenhasbeentaken up incorrespondence between the members of the conference individually, and between the conference collectively and the Swiss Government; and, as real difficulties have been found intervening in the way of a restitution of the property itself, and as opposition has also been made by one of the members of the conference to any change at all being made in the terms of the proposal, the King will certainly give up his objections, if he has not done so already. But on one point, if the inference I draw from certain remarks I have heard be correct, he will nevertheless insist upon a change,-and that will be with reference to the sum of money to be paid him by Switzerland. In the beginning he stipulated for 2,000,O00f., under the name of "back revenues," to be paid him. The amount was a nominal one, but the object was in this form to procure a stringent recognition on the part of Switzerland that during these nine years past he has been de jure Prince of NeuchUel, and the amount, when received, was destined togo towards indemnifying the indigent Swiss sufferers by the self-interested attempt of a few patrician families to restore the former oligarchy in Neuchatel. The mere naked recapitulation in the treaty proposing that "Switzerlsnd pays to the King of Prussia l,OOO,OOOf." does not realize the object I he had in view, and he will therefore-or l am very much mistaken-decline to accept any money at all from Switzerland. What it will be necessary to do for the NeuchUtelois, at present driven from theirhomes and with their future livelihood destroyed or jeopardized, he will do from his privy purse. His objections to the insufficiency of the guarantee appear to have been removed by representations made by the Emperor, that the fulfilment of the treaty on the part of Switzerland is more or less placed under the guarantee of the four Powers. The present phase of the Dano-German conflict is also approaching an gelaircusewnt, satifactory for the moment, but not particularly promising for the future. The Danish linistry, or rather the trunk of the late Ministry, decapitated by the secession of Her von Scheele, has, after five weeks' incessant manceuvring and negotiation, been compelled to declare its incapacity to make up its complement of statesmen; the two portefeuilale for Foreign Affairs and for the Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg hava been going begging for these five weeks past, and. five men, if not more, have refused to have anything to do with them. As soon as it was knowa that Herr Heinzelmann, their last hope, had declined joining them, Professor Hall resolved to propose to the King that the surviving members of th, late Ministry should retain their portefeuilles, that he himself should take the Presidency of the Council; the Minister of Marine should, in addition to his own office, hold the rtefeilQ of Foreign Affaira; and that the Minister of the Interior should at the same time administer Holstein and Lauenburg. This makeshift of a Cabinet has been approved and confirmed by the King, and its first act was to send off aa answer to the two German Powers, aggreeing in so far to their last demands as that the estates of Holstein and Lauenburg are to be convoked towards the eni of August; on which occasion those changes in their constitution which had lately been octroye to them without their consent are to be sabmitted to their deliberation. One of these changes was the removal of the State domains of the Duchies from the disposition of the estates, and the transfer of them to the Government for the entire Monarchy; and it was this, more than any other arbitary act on the part of Denmark, that had called forth the remonstrances of the German Powers. The Copenhagen journal Faedre&rndet publishes some private letters from Stockholm, which state that King Oscar, in consequence of too close attention to basiness, has become so seriously ill that h;s physicians have required him to abstain from a'l further exertion and to go into the conntry; and, in consequence of this state of things, the Crown Prince had been sunmoned to Stockholm from Christiania, where he resides as Viceroy of Norway. The official journal of Sweden, the 1Postidning, has confirmed this news so far as that the King was about to repair to Drottningholm to take the beneat of the country air. The Aftonbldet hasa? however, sbsequent stated that this remnoval of the King was for the present countermanded. In the Christiania papers of the ame date (12th inst.} there was no.mention of the Crown Prince Viceroy having been -summoned to Stockholm on accouat of the illness of the King his father.

THE UNITED STATES. (R oim OWNVNCRPSO-E- NEW YORK, MAY 5. The municipal anarchy alluded to in my last letter begins, if we may believe the partisan press, to assume the form of revolution. We are gravely told that the rebellious Mayor has placed in the hands of the police a part of the flint muskets which George Iaw and Kosauth are said to have designed for the annihilation of the House of Hapsburg. Should the Courts sustain the action of the State, we are further told that these are to be used to resist its authority, and tbat this tyranny-riddea island is to be declared an independent State, and, as such, is to add another star to the national banner, and another strophe to the national piean. I need not say that there is a great deal of political fancy in such bugbears. AU that outsiders know of the troubles that agitate the political world of the metropolis is that the streets are perhaps a little thicker with dirt than usual, notwithstanding the copious rains of the last few days. They read the story of the struggle over their quiet breakfasts in the morning, and forget it in the turmoil of basiness until the next day farnishes another tranquil hour. The indifference of the mass of the legal voters to these questions ought to furnish plenty of food for reflection in Europe. The city of New York is one of the heaviest taxed municipalities in the world. A population of about three-quarters of a million is burdened with an annual taxation of over a million and a-half sterling, for which it has badly-paved streets, a police by no means as efficient as it should be, though much better than formerly, the greatest amount of dirt north of Italy, the poorest cab system in any metropolis in the world, and only unsheltered wooden piers for the discharge of its merchandise. Nature has done everything she could to prevent this. The city lies on an island between two broad rivers, neither at the widest point much more than a mile distant from the backbone. Nothing can be easier than to keep it clean. The island, too, is a mass of rock; excellent paving material close at hand. The streets are generally wide and rectangular; there is no difficulty in maintaining an effective police. The tides are moderate, and the waters broad on each side; nothing is easier than to maintain good piera. The narrowness of the island compels long distances; a good cab system would seem a necessity, and yet a cab is unknown. Hundreds of thousands are paid for street cleaning, and yet the streets remain dirty while the contractors and officers grow rich. Every few years there is a desperate effort to rid the city of the incubus of politicians. One system of administration is tried, and it is found that plunderers get power under it, that the expenses increase, and that the evils continue without modification. Things get too bad to bear, and we reform our charter. At the very first election the same old faces turn up, perhaps one or two of the most chaffy winnowed out. Thus we go onfirst evils-then evils too great to bear-then reforms-then the old story over again. The present changes differ from all others in that they have been made by a country party, hostile to city politics, and, although everybody is willing to admit the evils of the existing system, they are not disposed to acquiesce in the change which transfers power to a minority, with the chances of that power being used as unscrupulously. In my last letter I endeavoured to explain' how the outs and the ins were struggling for the possession of the police. Independently of party consideration the proposed change has the example of London to recommend it. Bat the old police was a powerful agent in the hands of the Democrats. The Republicaun have made the mistake of maldng the new system an equally powerful adjunct to their cause. Hence the resistance. The intervention of injunctions has been carried to an excees. The new (Republican) commissioners were first enjoined from exercising their powers by a Democratic justice. Then a Republican justice enjoined the controller from paying the old officers. Tied up in this way the parties had to come to some understanding, and yesterday some orders were entered by which next month we hope to see the end of the quarrel, and have the question settled one way or the other. Anything which wiUl produce a better state of things here will be hailed with delight by the tax-paying, business, politics-neglechng citizens. One of the Sunday papers has been lately publishing the biographies of the members of the city government. It is astonishing to ace how many come from the Emerald Isle. While the native-born American is occupied with his business, accumnlating or losing his fortune, the Irishman, true to his instincts, turns his attention to politics, and finds his way to the city government and to the handling of the great results of taxation. A careful study of the history of municipal affairs in New York for the last ten years will do away with all astonishment at the magnitude of the Irish exodus. But to return to the present state of anarchy. Independently of the police department, Iwhich I have already alluded to, the Herald gives the following as the condition of the other departments.-The Superintendent of Repairs and Supplies is ousted by the new Acts. He holds on to his books and papers and sets the new laws at defiance. The Department of Streets and Lamps passes quietly into the new hands. The Controller also recognizes the validity of the new charter and pays none of the old officers. The Commissioner of the Street Department is equally acquiescent, and the City Inspector (who is hereafter to have charge of the cleaning of the streets) is the same. Thus you will see that while a part of the old authorities acquiesce in the charge, a part resist it, and we are threatened with a very pretty quarrel. It would be unjust to Newv York, having drawn this picture of its municipal affairs, not to say a word on the other side. The indifference to public things which aas, in all the changes of form and of party, thrown power into irresponsible hands, grows out of the energy which has made New York what it is. While yet in freshest youth it has become a giant in size, and the exertions of its better citizens are still exhausted in private accumulations, while the dutiesof administration are left to other hands. Turn to where the hand of individual enterprise has been felt, and you behold quite another picture,-streets of warehousesof unequasledgrandeurandbeauty-abay filled with shipping freighted with cargoes from all parts of the world-a river ploughed by steamers unsurpassed in size and luxury-and a population gathered from every Christian nation, energetic, pushing, money-seeking, each infusing some of his own national customs into the manners of New York, and gradually giving it a character of its own. In its public schools we see a system of education equal to the wants of so great a population admirably administered; in its public libraries liberal foundations for the future wants of a great metropolis; in its private libraries evidences of an enlarged and scholarly culture; in its patronage of art a proof of growing taste; in its crowded and lively streets the freedom of a metropolis; aud in its many and beautiful churches evidence that its inhabitants carry into spiritual matters the same vigour which distinguishes their temporal life? and pay more attention to church than municipal government. Mr. Buchanan also has his troubles as well as the Mayor of New York. Brigham Young grows more and more restiff under the interference of the Washington Gentiles with the affairs of the Faithful iin Utah, . The federal officers are quietly turned auris, and Mormon musrderersof Geintile wandeketA 'are acquitted by Mormon juries, and rewarded with Brigham's approving smile. 'The Indiana between Salt Lake cty and the Gentile outpost are incited to murder and- plunder; and things have now come to such a pass that the President has had some difficulty in finding a man of the right stamp to take the post of governor of the territorY. Rebellion with Brigham Young means something more serious than rebellion at a party meeting in New York. With a thousand miles of desert and mountain between him and the frontier forts on the BMissouri, with the still more difficult psses of the Sierra Nevada on the California frontier, with a body of hardy men, supplied with arms, and trained to their use, he evidently feels himwelf in a position to make terms. He denies the right of the Federal Government to interfere with the domestic institution of the territory; quote, the Dred'Scott decisionto the constitutionl lalwyers, and theexamplesof Abraham, David, and Solomon to the advocates of the " higher law." He denies its right, too, to inquire into the amini- tration of rminal jtutioe byldormon courts and juries. Ii thiastate of things the poit of Governor is no inecure. It demands coolness, tact. and oourage. UO Xmmaner in which the nesw official dischargea his duties may depend whether this country is cursed with s long and harassing civil war. The foreign relations of the country are just nonv engrossiDg the attention of the press, to the exclu. sion even of the aDpointments. Foremost among all is the Central American question, revivea by the rumour that the modifications to the Dallas. Clarendon Treaty made by the Senate are rejected in London. The columns which but a week ago were responding to Lord Napier's good wishes now bristle with defiant adjectives. On the whole, however, there is less complaint than might have been expected. At Washington there is complete harmony and confidence between the Cabinet and the English and French Ministers upon these questions. Whatever jealousy General Cass may have had of the increase of English infiuence upon the Isthmus, it has not affected his views as to the course to be pursued by the United States in its present dehcate relations with the State of New Grunada. There is no present prospect that the difficulty will go further than a suspension of diplomatio relations, and possibly an increase of force upon the line of the Californian traffic. There are also signs of further troubles in Kansas. The Free State party have decided not to take part in the approaching elections, so that it is certain that Kansas williapply for admission to the Union as a Slave State. The ground upon which the Free State party justifies its neglect is that the offices are all in the hands of those who tyrannized over them in the days of " bleeding Kansas," and that they cannot expect fair dealing at their hands. The question must then come directly before the next Congress whether Kansas shaU be admitted as a Slave State; and, although there wiLl be much discussion, I apprehend there can be but one result-its admission. Then there is a clear line of demarcation between parties for the Presidential election of 1860, subject to a complete change in the political aspect by the intervening acquisition of Caba or the swallowing of Mexico. While the murrain is raging in Europe our western farmers are snffering from a hog distemper, brought on by the use of strychnine in the manufacture of whisky. It seems that the hog (who plays on a western farm much the same part that cattle do in Northern Germany, or sheep on the Downs) revels in the malt left from the manufacture of whisky. The whisky makers have taken to the use of strychnine for the purpose of extracting more, and more potent, spirit from the grain. The men drink the whisky and live; but the hogs eat the malt and die. The thing has become so alarming that the Legislature of Ohio have been obliged topass an Act rendering the useof strychuine in the manufacture of whisky a crime. The Cunningham trial has commenced. The public interest felt in the investigation is heightened by the simultaneous appearance of another crime in the rural districts, shrouded in equal mystery. Like all the great tragedies of life, from the first fall to Mrs. Manning and Mrs. Cunningham, love was at the bottom of this. A labourer in the town of Newburg, going out early in the morning to finish sowing a field remote from any house, discovered in one of the furrows the nearly naked body of a handsome woman, the skull fractured, blood exuding from the nostrils, ears, and mouth, and the throat showing marks of strangulation. The few under-clothes that were on were arranged in an unskilfal and unwomanly manner, showing that some masculine hand had probably tied them on after death, for the purpose of misleading and baffling inquiry. A cameo brooch found near the body was the only other clue to the mystery. The body was brought to Newburg, where soon one and then another and another without concert recognized it as the body of a Miss Bloom. Inquiry was made, and it was found that Miss Bloom had disappeared since the precedinr, Tuesday, when she left (at 9 o'clock at night) in company with one Jenkins. Jenkins (a married man) confessed that he had driven her, at her own request, five or six miles in the country, about midnight had put her down within 200 feet of the house to which she was going, and returned instantly to Newburg. Miss Bloom's sister was sent for, and at once recognized the body. The features were much discoloured, but a marked scar over the left eyebrow, a sore upon the elbow, a mole above the right knee, and a very unusual formation of the little toe of the right foot were proofs of identity stronger even than the resemblance between the living and the dead face. The under-clothes and the cameo she had never seen before. A surgical examination supplied a motive why a married man should wish to commit such a deed. Jenkins was arrested, and the deceased Miss Bloom was buried at the public expense in the midst of the assembled village. Scarcely, however, had the funeral train left the church when the supposed deceased reappeared, to divide with the actual victim the wonder of the crowd. The extraordinary piece of circumstantial testimony was overthrown, and the accused Jenkins was set free. I doubt whether the annals of criminal jurisprudence afford a more remarkable instance of the uncertainty of circumstantial evidence. The city of Albany is said to have refused to pay the interest upon a portion of its loan, in order to test the constitutionality of the law by which the loan was made. This is reported in all the morning papers to-day. But I understand that the city authorities have grown wiser, and pay their Interest.
SPORTING INTBLLIGBNoE. -T' TATTEESALL.T'S- MnaAI Tha Derby horses were knocked about in a perplexing manner, and so sudden and rapid were the changes that it was with difficalty that we were enabled to compile a correct price carrent. The most important incident was the advance of Tournament, who, it was reportd-, ha mostsatisfactorilytried. Early in the afternoonl2tol toat 7001. was taken about him; afterwards a slight reaction set in, and 13 to 1, 14 to 1, and 15 to I were laid. At the close, however, he was decidedly firm at 11 to L taken freely. 7 to 1 was offered against Skirmisher without effect, but a point higher odds would have commanded backers. 9 to i was repeatedly taken about Arsenal, bat it was also currently offered throughout the afternoon. 11 to I was laid against Anton to 504.; 10 to 1 might have been obtained without difeculty. The odds against MLD. fluctuated between 15 to 1 and 100 to 8, the latter price being, perhaps, his correct quotation. Sprig-of-Shillelagh was steady; le was not, however, backed for a very large sum; the last bet about him was 1,000 to 80. 1,000 to55 was taken three times about Lady Hawthorn. Bird-in-the-Hand was friendless; 20 to I was currently offered against him, and, indeed, we believo layers might have been found who would have accommodated backers at any prico between 100 to 5 and 100 to 3; 30 to 1 was laid once agst Adamas, but subsequently 25 to I was taken. Saunterer made a further retrogression, 20 to 1, 22 to 1, and flnalUy 25 to 1 were Iid against him. 1,000 to 15 was betted five times against Lambourno. 1,000 to 4 and 6,000 to 30 were laid against Nevwton-loWiUows.

HER CORB TRADZ. MABRK.L&W MOwDAY ArlxooN. MAY 18. With a plentiful supply of foreign barley And country flour last 'weel4 of wheat and other corn the arrivals were moderate. The exports were 140 quarters of o&ts and 552 sacks of flour. The receipts in wheat were 6,964 quarters Znglish, nd 6,345 quarters foreign. The show of imples this morning from Kent and Essex was small, and less 4dl neses was evinced in s.-des, which proceeded, however, but slowly, and rather in bayers' favour, as compared with the reduced rates 'f last Week. In foreign no altoration Wa quoted, The quantity of English flour Was 18,649 sukslr with 100 sabcs and 1,433 barrels f.oreign. The warm weather lessened tho denand for Norfolks, which were quotedat Ss. to 39, per sack, barrels not being offered lower. There were only 316 quartera of home-grown barley, but the foreign reached 18,740 quarters. The higher qualities ware dull, and scarcely maintined their late salue, whilt for grinding parcels the demand Wa good at full prices. hIalt was a very slow ale, but without change of quota_ tires. The oat supply was short-vis., 161 quarters English, 241 qusrters Scotch, 2,380 quarters Irish, and 10,435 quarters foreign. Factors reqaired ful term,6 but they were not readly paid, dealers stil having fair reservestocks. Of beaus there were plenty, of native growth exclusively -viz., 1,592 quarters. This good supply obliged holders to accept somewhat lovrer terms. Of pesg there were only 130 quarters English, and 1,070 quarters white foreign. The market wua decidodlyimprovd for boilers, the short supplies and low rates having atected attention. The supply of linseed was 1,295 quarters, with 17 quartera exported.

ZTOxNY-KMA=TRand CITYIZiTTZflGROE. monday Evening. The faund opened this morning at an improvemont of an eighth, and a reaction chich subse. quently occurred was merely temporary. Consols for money were first quoted 93i to 94. From this they receded to 93i, but there was no general pressure on the market, and the last official prices were 93i to 94 forr money, and 943 to i for the 4th of June. After regular hours there were buyers at 94l for the account. There was a diminution in the demand for money, and the rate for advances on Government securities, instead of being 7i per cent., an on Saturday, was 6i to 7 per cent. The Government brokers continue their daily purchases of 30,0001. Exchequer-bills on account of the savings-banks, and were compeUed to-day to give an advanced price owing to the reduction already effected of the amounts in the hands of the dealers. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced 924 to i; New Three per Centa., 92& to j; India Stck, 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98g to ; India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; and Exchequerbills, June, Is. to 3a. pm. ; March, 3a. to 6s. pm. In the discount-rmarket the demand was rather less urgent, but the applications at the Bank were understood to be heavy. Foreign securities were dull at the opening, but they subsequently experienced a slight improvement and closed with firmness. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 95, 94k, and Â§; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at 1014; and for the account, at l01k, J, and 9. The other operations comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100. ; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 53~ and 54; Portuguese Three per Cents., for money, 461 ; and for tho account, 45j; Russian Five per Cents., 105i; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96g and 97i; Sardinian Five per Cents., for account, 91k; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 41k; and Dutch Four per Cents. Certifcatea, 97k The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourme this evening were 69f. 35c. for money, and 69f. 45c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a decline of an eighth. The letters from Paris state that the discountmarket is easier, and that there is also a better supply of money on the Bourse, the interest paid for carrying over transactions at the half-monthly settlement having been comparatively light. It is said that some of the operators in shares find that they have sold too largely. Some rather large amounts of specie from Russia are understood to be in course of arrival. A rumour has been put into circulation that the Bank of France have entered into a new contract for gold. The continental exchanges remain firm. At HEamburg the rate of discount is &6 per cent; at Amsterdam it is 4 per cent. The specie from New York to-day by the America is 103,0001., and from the West Indies, by the Orinoco, ]53,0001. The latter comprises 86,0001. of Oalifomian gold. A considerable portion will be Eeat to the continent. The trade reports of the manufacturing towns for the past week show no material alteration, but the tendency in many cases has been towvards a further diminution of activity. At Manchester there is considerable dulness, prices of goods being scarcely supported, even in the face of another advance in the raw material. The Birmingham accounts describe steadiness in the iron-market, and a good American demand. For the general manufactures of the place there have been numerous foreign orders, and an increase of activity is expected from the recent reductions in tin and copper. In the woollen districts there has been a slight revival, but great caution continues to be exercised. The Irish linenmarkets have been heavy. The financial advices from New York this week describe no great change either in the stock-market or in the general aspect of business. Erie Railway was quoted 42 to i ; New York Central, 86i ; Reading, 81; Panama, 94; and Illinois Central, 33n to 34 pm.; the Bonds, 99j. The rate of exchaige was slightly less firm, but gold shipments are likely to continue by each packet. Another case of railway default has been announced, the Lake Erie and Wabash Company having failed to meet the interest on their second mortgage bonds, due on the 1st inst. The non-payment to the company of 8,0001. due to them for freight money by the Great Western of Illinois Railway is pat forward as an excuse. After alluding to this failure and to that of the Great Western of Illinois previously announced, as well as to the circumstance of the city of Albany, the capital of the State of New York, having repudiated its liability on the bonds of the Northern Railroad Company, the New York Herald observes,-" We have here, in the space of 30 days; the non-payment of interest on the bonds of three railroad companies, and the repudiation by the second city in the great State of New York of an endorsement or guarantee of railroad bonds negotiated upon its faith and credit." From Mexico the letters by this arrival are to the 4th of April, and contain nothing of importance. From California, accor3ing to the New York T7ibune, " the advicea do not mndicate any very excessive anxiety on the part of the Legislature orpeople to assumethe payment of the State bonds ;" the Seven per Cents. had therefore been sold at 48. The accounts regarding the progress of the silk crop continue on the whole satisfactory. In Spain some new silk has already appeared in the market, and the crop, which is almost secured, is expected to be "half a good crop." Last year it was almost a total failure. In Naples and Sicily there have as yet been no adverse signs, and from the Roman States and Tuscany the statements are very favourable. In Lombardy the prospect seems more doubtful, but it is still too early to form a positive opinion respecting that country. From France the advices each day describe an improvement, and the worms are now between the second and third stage. Complaints are made of the seed from Lombardy, and also of the French seed, but these have been successfully replaced by seed from Brussa and TuscanyThe mulberry-leaf is said to be fine and abundant, but the price is high-a fact which seems to indicate confidence in the health of the worms, and a large consumption. The commercial advices from India to-day are not unfavourable. At Calcutta the market for imported goods was inactive, but it was a period of the season which is always dulL At Bombay the import market was firm, and there had been a fair extent of business. Both at Calcutta and Bombay the supply of money had been considerably increased by the late arrivals of specie, and the exchanges were slightly lower, and were expected to continue in that direction, so as to check the spede shipments from this country. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised only three vessels-two to Port Phillip and one to Sydney, with an aggregate capacity of 3,188 tons. In the general business of the port of London there has been some improvement during the past week. This is owing to the chauge of wind; but there are still many vessels overdue. It is supposed that there were more than 500 ships weather-bound in the Channel at the beginning of the week. The number of ships reported inward wavs 19)2, being 61 more than in the previous week. These included 51 with cargoes of eorn, flour, rice, &c. The number cleared outward was 141, including 17 in ballast, showing an increase oi 6. The Spray of the Ocean has arrived from Shanghai, with 842,2001b. of tea and 1,029 bales of silk. The Hero has arrived from Geelong, the Wellington from Hobart Towon, and the FIeda from Poltland Bay, but they are not believed to have brought rnw od Special settling days have been appointed by the Committee of the Stock-Exchange as foUowsEast Indian Railway, E extension shares, Friday, May 22; Lancashire and Yorkshire, new 91. shares, Monday, May 25; both descriptions to be marked in the official list.

RALWAY AND MINING HA=B,. Monday Evening. The railway-market was not active, but prices exhibited rather more firmness in the later hours of buFiness. Indian descriptions were fairly supported, and French improved about be. to lOs. per share. Grand Trunk of Canada were favourably influenced by purchases; G3reat Western of Canada closed at a slight decline. The shares of the several mziscellaneous companies presented scarcely any change, and the business transacted was altogether ]imaitecl.

LAW REPOBT. I PAMGATIVB COURT. MoIDAY-. TAV 1R DE BEIUCHEsE V. HOflnnnga zreyore -ir JOHN DJODSONAI Mir dOHN J.ODSON delivered judgment in this case, the facts of which were reported in Vw Times of March 2. It was a question, le said, sa to the validity of the will, with two codicils annexed thereto, of Major-General Hodpon, who died in the year 1855. They were propounded by mr Hodgson, the widow and second wife of the deceased, and were opposed by Madame De Beauchesne, his daughter by his first wife, and sole next of kin. The several infsruments were drawn, executed, and attested according to the forms of the English law, and were opposed on the ground that General Rodgson was domiciled in France, and that they were invalid, beeause they were not made according to the law of the country in which he was so domicUedL It was not averred that be had become a French subject or citizen by naturalzation or by any other act of formal authorization, but it was contended that he had acquired a French domicile according to the jus gentium-namely, by are dence in that country animo nanendi. The learnedjudge then traced the history of the deceased, who was born at Congleton, in Cheshire, in 1781, went out to India as a cadet in 1799, and fnally returned to Earope in 1829. In 1832 he took up his residence in Paris, And, with the exception of oeasional visits to England and Scotland, remained there until his death. The conclusion must boe that he went to France animo snanecnd and was domiciled there according to thejusgenatium The only question, therefore, was as to the necessity of persons domiciled in France using the French form. That was completely settled by the recent declsion of the Judicial Committee in " Bremer v. Freeman and Bremer," and, whatever might bave been his own opinion before tht deion was pronounced, he was bound to follow up the doctrine of the Superior Court. Re must ronounco against the papers propounded, but woald ecree the costs ofeaUiparhes to bo paid out of the estate.
COUB21 OF BAN2KRUPTCY, Binghstrect, 3f.ay 18. Mr. ComMissioner GoUs.U-sl diqpoeed of the business of the day. His HONOUR ordered an adjournment sine die in the case of J. Hanbury, grocer, of Brenchley, Kent, observing that he wonld not, as already intimated, pass the examination of bankrupts upon acounts that were unvouched, and mnerelynpon "conjecture." A second clas certificate 'was awardeed to S. Geoghegan, printer and engraver, of Paisgrave-place, Strand. In the matter of D. Morris, grocer, of Wis'each, it was objected by a creditor that the accounts were nnvouched to the extent of 1,8001. On his behalf it was urged by MÂ§r. CHIDLEY that the assets had realized 800., of which a sum of 571. was cash. His HloNou said, in this case he should pass the examination, or the noxt bankrupt who was similarly situated would not bring the 571. Mr. A. Turner appeared for the assignees.

Mr. Lovett, printer, Queen-street, Cbeapside, complained tbat the insolvent owed him 401 for printing bill-heads and cards, and also for a cying-press. vwhen he set up as a wholesale grocer, as " owel and Co.," in Laurec Pountney-lane. From the schedule it appeared that the insolvent owed 131l. 12s. 7d., and claimed 168t. as due to him, of which 1424. was alleged to be owing by Mr. George Cruik-shank and others, who were described as the directors of the General Industry Assurance Company. The insolvency was partly attributed to the connexion with the insurance company.c The EIEF COMUMSSxO2NIM said a certificate from the surgeon of the prison had been handed in of the insolvent's illness, and it would seem that he had nearly lost his voice. A question was put to the insolvent, and it was evident that he could scarcely articulate. The learned CommmoSSNu went over the debts in the schedule. It appeared that eome of the articles spplied by MIr. Lovett had been sold for 91. The insolvent had a little stock as a wholesale grocer, and it was stated that he had been a traveller in the same line, and after his employers failed he commenced as a wholesale grocer on his own amcount. Mr. Lovett said he considered that he had been badly used. The Cmrs COMUSSIOVER remarked, that the insolvent onght to have known better. There were two petitions in the court beside the present. There was a debt in the schedule to another printer of 10. for printing a pamphlet, Is it Lawful to do Good on aie salbath i The insolvent had put down the directors of the General Industry As. surance Society for 1421. for services rendered, ' but I don't think," said the learned ComnisAioner, " the assiee will easily recover that.> His Honour considered that the debt ,with Mr. Lovett had been 'wantonly incurred, and when he must have known that he had very little chance, if any intention, of paying it. There could be no justification for such conduct. It was evident the insolvent was ll, and he should therefore let the case stand over to arrange with Mr. Lovett. The case was adjourned to the 6th of June.
MIDDLSX SNESSIONS, Mondaiy, MJy 18. (Before the Amsskant.judg.) Henry Hills, 49, described as a clerk, of superior educa. tion, was indicted for unlawfaUy assaulting Hannah Stamp, a girl under 12 years of age, with intent, &c. He pleaded " }Guilty." Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Metcalfe were for the prosecution, Mr. Sleigh for the prisoner. The prisoner's wife had a school at No. 7, Grundy-street, oplar, and the prosecutrix was one of her scholars. He had been gmlty of indecent conduct to many other girls. M1r. Serseant PARRY said, he was instracted on behalf of a Society for the Protection of Females, to which he had been standing counsel some years, and of all the cases which had come under his notice the present was, perhaps, the worst. The prisoner had abused girls who had attended his wife's school in 16 or 17 instances which could be proved, and, no doubt, in a great many others; and there was not one circumstance of mitigation in his favour. Mr. SLEIGHss said, the prisoner had withdrawn his plea of "Not Guilty," and confessed his guilt of his own accord amnd since he had been in prison he had written a lette;r expressing the greatest contrition for his conduct. As far s the prisoner himsself was concerned, he (Mr. Sleigh) was to urge anything in his favour; but his h einvolvedin pain and the greatest possible distress by his conduct, a circumstance which the Court would perhapstake into c.nsideration in dealing with him. The ASSISTA.&?JUDGE sentenced the prisBoner to be kept to hard labour for one year. Wiliam Benson, 51, weaver, was indicted for feloniously embezzling three sums of money amoun' to COll., received by him on account of James BeUett and others, to whom he was servant. He surrendered in court. Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Ribton appeared for the prosecion; Mr. Sleigh for the prisoner. This prosecution was instituted by the trustees of the gift fund of the Loyal United Friends Society, of which there were three lodges, and to which the prisoner hadbeen secretary for a number of years. It was his duty to receive the contributions of members, fines, and all money applicable to the fund, and to account for the same to the trustees through the treasurer, who usually was the landlord of the publichonse where the lodge was held. The case against him was that he had received money in his capacity of secretary, vwhich he had appropriated to hih owen use, and never accounted for in the books. There wrere three indictments against him, and one of the carges was that be had obtained two sums of 1Og. by means of forged At the conclusion of the case for the prosecntion, Mr. SanGoEE said, he had watched the case closely, and, as he found he had not an inch of ground to stand upon, it would be useless to attempt to make any defence. That the prisoner had embezzled these sums could not be denied, but the defalcations were of modern date. although he had heldthesitation of secretary to the fund for 20 years. Distress haa been the cause of this deviation from his long course of honesty, and he threw himself upon the consideration of the Court. The jury then fonnd the prisoner Cusil,. Mr. A=IALrEg sad, the defalcations amounted to more than lOOZ, The iSTANT-JUDG said, he regarded 'be case as one of an aggravated nature, the prisoner being intrusted to receive sma31 sums of money from poor, hard-working persons, to be apphed to purposes for mutual benefit, and such a fraud was a at discouragement to societies of that description, which really were very beneficial to that claSS of persons who formed them, when properly conducted. t:nh a case could not be lightly passed over, and the sentence was that the prisoner be kept to hard labour for 15 calendar months,. James Newland, 32, boilermaker, was indicted for having fraudulently obtained the sums of uls. 3d., 3s., and 8s. 4d., from Jarvis Jones, with intent to defraud. Mr. Sleigh was counsel for the prosecution. It appeared that the prisoner some time ago was secretary to a branch of the Friendly United Boilermakers Society at Bridgewater, but had re0inquished that office, and had ceased to belong to the society altogether. The society's funds were to afford assistance to members out of work, travelling, or sick, and on the 25th of March the prisoner intr'duced himself to Jarvis Jones, the secretary of a branch of the society at Limehonse, and presented a card or certificate, purporting to be from the Bristol branch, and signed by the president and secretary, showing that he was a member, and a such entitled to assistance from any branch of the society to wlich he might apply. In the belief that the prisoner really was a member of the society and that the certificate was a genuine one, Jones took him to the treasurer and directed him to pay him 12s., less 9d., which would be due as contributions as a member, and subsequently he received 4s. and the amount of the fare to Sheerness, where work had been procured for him, and on another occasion 8s. 4d. Subsequently it was found that he was not a member of the society, and that the certificate was a fictitious one. It bore the mark of a seal which had been intrcsted to the prsoner as secretary, and the p.aession of which he bad improperly retained-at leAt it had hever been seen eince he ceasedto hold the office. The present charge was then preferred against him, and he was given ito custody.a The prisoner in hs defence repudiated having hadany dishonesintention. Negotthe aertificate at Bristol bo show that he belonged to the trade in any town he might go to, Ho had paid nto th society for ten tears and a-ha and never received ashilling out. Wheneleft theq ocieey he was going to America, bat he could not get a ship, an he then got a situation under e&srs. Penn and Sons at Devonport in fitting out gunboats, but that work was finished last June, and through sickne4a he had only done six weeks' work since. He h d received a notice that he could rejoin the societyby paying up his arrers, and he was acting upon that when he told Jones to dedact 9d.ontof the 12s. for contribution money. The jury found him GUM. Frominquiries then made, it appeared that the prisone'schna;racter wans none of the best,and he had been wuder the surveillance ofthe plice at Bri5toL He was connicted of felony 19 years ago, and had been tried a short time since, but acquittd } bTheA iQ=gJuG sentenced him to six months hard (Before Zfr. CRzASY.) John Richard Holland, a very respectable-looking young man, Wms indicted for embezzling the several sams of 41. 19s. znd 22. 3s. 8d., received from Mr. Rogers. and 71. 5o. 6d., received from 3ir. Raymond, for and on account of Thomas Wilhiunn Hunt, his master. psr. F. H. ewis proseutd, Mr. Payne defendod the prisoner. The prosecutor is a wholesale grooer, and the prisoner had been in his service for six months as town traveller at 30s. a-week, without comniisdion. It was his duty to pay over the sums he received from the customers every evening to theashier, and hewas charged writh having received certain sums of money wshich he had not accounted for. Mr. ohnRogrs,a grocer and -cheesemonger, of No. 1, Providence.place, St. George'sginathaE-ae, said, he was 3a customer of the prosecutor, and the prisoner had boen in e habit of callng upon him for orders. In February lst he paid the prisoner the sum of 81. l9s. 4d. for goods receivedi aur,ado h 7ho ac epi i fnrthesuof 21, 3e d. for goods. He did not return any sugar to the amount of 52 He took receipts for the sums paid. Mr. Edward Raymond, a grocer, of No.1106, HIigh-street, Hoxton, said on tho 6th of April ho received goods to the anmount of 71. 8s. from the prosecutor, and on the Tuesday folloivng the paid the prisoner the sum of 71. 5s. Gd. in discharge of the debt, and received the prisoner' receipt for th ment of tTe money. t:. Weorge Arthur Simpson, cashier to the prosecutor, said the prisoner had to pay over to him the moneys he received on account of his master every day. The prisoner made his own entries of the amounts in a cashbook, and witness put his initials to them as he handed over the money. The prisoner did not pay over to him in February Ilst the sum of 8l. l9s. 4d., referred to by the first witness. On the 10th of February he paid 12. 16s. 8d. as rceived from Mr. Rogers, and on the 24th of the same month he aid n a further sum of 2l. 3s. 8d. on account of Mr. Rogers, making together 4Z. Os. 4d., bat leaving a deficiency of the sum he had really received of Mfr. Rogers. He had not paid over either the sum of 72. fis 6d. received by him fom Br aymond. Ait the request of the prisoner he made an entry in the ledger to the credit of Mir. Rogers for cwt. of sugar, wich he said had been retuarned, hut that wratsaftedrvwadsfound tobe untrue, as no sugar had been Mr. PAYNE cross-examined the witnesses, and afterwards addressed .he jury for the purpose of shovwing that Mr. Hunt's accounts were kept in a careless way, and that in several cases the prisoner had been the means of errors being rectified. If there had been any deficiency in the accoants he attributed it to accident, and not to any felonious intention, and if it was not proved that there was a felonious taking of the money the prisoner could not be convicted on Mr. CRSY summoe up, and left it to the iur1 to say 'whether such defalcations could be the result of accident, or 'whether they arose from felonious intentions. *Thejury found the prisoner Guy, but recommended hirn to mercy on account of his previous good character. Mr. F. H. LEWIS said that, since the prisoner had Ibeen committed on the present charge, the prosecutor had found out furtthefracts Of embezzlement by the prisoner to the Mr. CEs&sY sentenced the prisoner to ten months' hard labour. James Baldwin and Edward Coleman were Beverally indicted-Baldwin for stealing 951b. of oats and other articles, the property of John *Vragg, his master; and Edward Coleman with receiving them, well knowing them to have been stolen. Baldwin pleaded " Guilty ;" Coleman, "N Not Guilty." Mr. Sleih and Mr. Poland prosecuted; Mr. T. Atkinson app eared for Coleman. It appeared that the prosecutor is the owner of a farm at East Barunet, and for some time past he had had suspicions that hay and corn had been surreptitiously afstracte rom his premises, and he accordingly got the assistance of a police constable to enable himto trace the thieves. Between aund 4 o'clock on the morning of the 8th of April he kept watch on the premises, and saw Baldwin, who is carman to Hr. Wragg, put a truss of hay and something in a sack into a waggon with three horses, and drive away towards London. The policeman, who was in the dress of a batcher followed the waggon to Southpgte, when he spoke to Baldwin, telng him that he was very tired and asked him to give him a ride, to which he assented, and he got into the wagn, and they zodetogether to the Jolly Butchers at wood-green. On the wiay the disgaused police man ascertained that the sack contained oats, which had been brought from the prosecutor's premises. When they stopped near the Jolly Batchers, Coleman, who was occasionally employed as a stableman, made-his appearnce, and with rather a supicious glance at the aupoosed butcher asked Baldwin whether all was right? Baldwin replied, " Yes, he's only a tired butcher from Hitchin ;" and went on to say that he would take the hay if he, Coleman, would take the corn. They carried the sack of oats into a stable yard, and were about to concealit,when the " tired butcher" suddenly transformed himself into a police-constable, and charged Baldwin with stealing, and Coleman with receiving. Baldwin then offered him a sovereign, and Afterwards 5s, to say nothing about it, but he was deaf to all such en. treaties. The sack contained nearly lowt. of oats. Mr. ATKIiSON, in his address to the jury, pointed out discrepancies in the evidence, npon which he urged the jury to acquit Coleman, and remarked upon the policeman personating a " tired butcher" by way of a snare. $Theonag jur AcquitdCrolemtan.

GUILDEHALL-George Turner, aged 15, William Sutton, [13, Wiliam Culver, 14, Charles Deakins, 15, and Fre. derick Turner, 14, the cbildren of respectable parents, were charged with picking poclkets on the pier at Blackfriarsbridge Alfred Green, a detective officer, said,-About half-past 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon I saw George Turner, Sutton, and Culver on Blackfriars-pier. They were upon the dummy, which with the pier was very much crowded. Turner and Culver placed themselves in front of a woman who was endeavouring to get outof the crowd, while Suttoa lifted her dress with his right hand and took something from her pockeS with his left which he transferred to hlis oVwn, and in doing so dropped a shillin. I immediately secured him and asked him to give me what he had taken, and he accordingly gave me the shilling,1which he had picked up. I then took them into the piermaster's office and searched them, when I found upon Sutton Is. in silver and 4d. in copper concealed ia the lining of his jacket, and a florin in his trousers pocket. On Culver I found only a halfpenny, and upon George Tnrner the plermaster found 1l. lvs. in gold, three halfcrowns, and 4.1d. mn copper money. I was taking them offthe pier when the pierman pointed out Deakins and Frederick Turner as being associated with the other prisoners, and I therefore took them into custody also,when 3Ad. in coppermoneywasfoundupon Deakins,and two halfcrowns,oneshilling,and4d in copperupon Frederick Turner. At the station, when asked to account for the money found on them, the two Turners stated that Sutton gave it to them to take care of for him. I also found upon each of the prisoners passenger tickets for Woolwich. Alderman HALE committed Sntton and Culver forthree months, George Turner for six weeks, Deakins forl2 day4, and F. Tnrner for 14 days with hard laboar. The prisoners vwere then removed, Culver, the most hardened criminal of the number, appearing the most repentant. Alderman HUMpggtny begged to acknowledge the receipt of lIs. from "an Indian officer," and 6s. from "B.S.," of Dublin, for Emily Stokes, the young woman who attempted to destroy herself a week ago by poison. MARLBO3mOUGU-STRl;T- HIenry Simpson and Henry Williams were brought before Mr. BzAnoN charged with having committed a burglary at No. 24, Gioodge-6treet. The first.named prisoner was also charged with committing a murderous atta.ck on Police-constable Woodward, E 63, with a crowbar. Police-constable Woodward, whose head was strapped up. statedthat he was on dnty in Goodge-street about 1 o'clock that morning, when 'ee heard a noise, and, on watching for about a minnte, he saw the iron grating of No. 24 pushed up, and the prisoner Williams make his appearance. He caught hold of the prisoner, and then drew his rattle to summon assistance. He saw the prisoner's hand move towards his pocket. He told the prisoner to keep his hand quiet. The prisoner instantly pulled from his pocket a heavy crowbar, and struck him a tremendous blow on the head with it. When he noticed the crowbar he struck the prisoner with his rattle, but the blow from the crowbar Was so severe that the prisoner got away and attempted to make his ecpe He folowed as weUl as he could, calling "' Stop thief l" and the pri0nerwas shortly afterwards brought baok by another constable. When taken to the station-house and searched tho tops of two cruets vwere found in his possession. On going back to the house where the prisoner was seen to come from it was ascertained that a burglary had been committed by forcing up the iron grting and then breaking open tho door of the back kitchen. The thieves had evidently been disturbed, as there were only a few artiolee of linen put together ready for carrying away, and a cupboard or two ransacked. The cruet tops found on the prisoner belonged to a cruet: gtand which was iS the hItchen. The prisoner Simpeon sid he would admit the murglary, andthen cro-examined the constable, inorder to slowr that it was imposible he oould without assistance have pushed up the iron gratin.

NAVAL STATTSTICS.-.The D4bats contains a statistical article on the losses excerienced by the French and other commercial navies in late years, from which we extract the following :-" Of the 32,000 to 34,000 vessels of all nations which are known to the maritime companies, ,80 vere lost in 1852-; 1,610 in 1853; A,120 in 1854 1,982 in 1855; and 2,124 in 1856. The month of December continues to furnish the greate-st amount of accidents 303 ont of 2,124 in 1856); then folows J anuary (289), then ovember (221), finay October and February (219 and 192); June is the month least anfavourable to navigation. 'The number of vessels lost v,ithout ever being heard of happily diminishes-in 1851 253 vessels were lost in that manner, in 1855 only 138, and in 1856 only 115 figure in this it. But this only is still sadly extensive, for, -calculating 12 men to a vessel, it represents 1,380 sailors, who in single year have paid for the prosperity of commercial relations. Of the 115 vessels thus lost in 1856, our navy figures for 15 and England for 42, and to the total fiure must be added 63 vessels burnt at sea. But what is really alarming is the increase of collisions at sea. The extension of steam conduces to this result, In 1845 only 594 collisions, producing 56 losses, took place; in 185I there were 743, with 69 losses; and in 1856, 908 collisions, with 91 losses. The number of these acoidents, entirely due to the want of caution, and of which the sea is inno. cent, has therefore nearly doubled within the last 12 years. In that period no less than 7,916 collisions. with 763 total losses, have taken plaee. This figure is thus made up:Collsions between steamers and steamers, 28 losses; between steamers and saihng vessels, 45; between sailing vessels and steamers, 90; between sailing vessels and sai ves- hIBITARtY CONFIBATION.-On Sun&Ay mom. shnels,545; cases'swhere bforthvessl sak 55 to ,763 losse s. hp Our oatone sue th Ryl tir tiontedton of offcergand e privates oa the cosers of viously undergone that eclesia8tica ie heewsa vewhice1lsnkingollisgaions Conyeseunl abFenc vessely eot Revey 2.hourslore, on Da , sx voesls Lit nn eratoo o ur inTr Kghidsags Colg,Uaoid, and chpan tothers as dres itr true gmarisoa rofLondn, replishor.o lnthe Bishop osnen atnded m the pulp ta doal and tory soeal ato ohf ohichwaesa o plnace a tionf the rgimengtssto -tioned aTthe velarios onr barrsen ks who had not pre-a tiomsly andergone tht th e nee n iastur rinte.eTr cwasractn woverwthelmiyg were atto raye having bthensrea them Re v. of ficeroe, i n- Profesonse of Cassd aic vieatrs inde ai rings olenw the, Lon er and cpain t noHe fllaestyws forces in the ga-ien of Lou ndo ttishpif of Lond on asied,e these itn deswv eredans earest {bHeaoto thegcan dhiates four gnfma tionu exdinin torero then ldainly ancresuc incty tho ntro of the cand moye, int hichhey wed rt true aboutaty akeinpot." repthen sido tote, and the yoiermroe,s in terrese inc f d arnct.

DIVOROE IN PRUSSIA. 'O.-- tvp,n." A? .,- -vvqrA7TnPNT.1 BgRWLT, MAY 14. In preparing the Bill for amending the law of Divorce, which was recently laid before Parliament, our Government found it expedient to inquire into the legislation of France, Austria, and Prussia on this subject, and peculiar value was attached to a knowledge of the latter, as showing how this difficult subject was treated in a country of similar Protestant faith to our own. What the proviEions of the existing law of divorce in Prussia are we may therefore assume to be sufficiently known to our jurists, as having lately been explained in the Government report; but how the said law works here,which it is equally essential to know, may perhaps not be so famiiiar to them. I therefore venture to send you some few details on this subject, to show you that the working of the existing law has bcen such, ever since its promulgation, as to make it most urgent on the Government materially to alter it, and that accordingly repeated attempts have been made .to this end, the latest of which took place no later than the beginning of this session. That portion of the existingAUlgemeines Landrecdt, or General Code (promulgated in 1794),which treats of the law of divorce dates as far back as 1750, and originally formed part of the Corpus Juris F,ridericani, an unfinished code of laws elaborated for Frederick the Great by his Grand Chancellor Cooceii; and its numerous provisions for facilitating divorce bear the unmistakeable stamp of the Voltairian spirit of levity in the treatment of acred muatters which characterized that Monarch and that age. But some time before the close of his reign Frederick recognized the pernicious effects of the too great facilities accorded by this law to divorce, and in 1782 issued an edict for restricting those facilities; this edict was, however set aside and disregarded, when, after his death, in the year 1794, the complete code still inforce-viz.,the AlUgemeines Land recht, was promulgated. The reason assigned for so doing was that the restrictions commanded by the late King had exercised an unfavourable effect on the increase of the population. The result of the lax legislation thus established in 1794 has been that the number of divorces actualy pronounced in Prussia reached at one time (between the years 1820 and 1830) an annual average of 3,000, in a total population of less than 12,000,000, being a proportion of 27 to every 100,000 inhabitants I The real proportion was, however, actually very much higher, inasmuch as the province of Rheinland, where the Code Napolicrn was and is still in force, and where the population is almost exclusively Roman Catholic (the discipline of whose Church does not admit of the sacrament of matrimony being annulled by any lay tribunal), furnished only one case to every 100,000 inhabitants; so that in the province of Brandenburg on the other hand, in which the capital is situated, where the population is almost exclusively Protestant, and the AUgemeines Land*recht is in force, the proportion amounted to 78 cases of divorce pronounced annually in every 100,000 inhabitants! No other code contains so many facilities for divorce,and no other country has 6O many divorces to register !* This fearful state of things is, however, not to be attributed solely to lax legislation and facUe process, but also in great measure to the irreligious views with regard to the holy bond of matrimony then prevalent, and to the influence of such literary works as inoculated the whole nation with their unholy virus in a most fascinating form, as, for instance, Goethe's beautifully written novel of Die WohlZerwandtschaft, than which perhaps no printed work ever produced more social mnschief in Germany. Under the religious auspices of the late and present King, as well as in consequence of a movement of protest in the Church against this wide-spreading dissolution of the holiest and most intimate ties, the evil has somewhat diminished; thus, whereas in 1818 there was an average of 1 divorce among every 247 married couples in the province of Brandenburg, the number has come down by degrees in 1851 to 1 divorce among every 485 couples-a state of things which, nevertheless, leaves very much to be desired. The decrease has also been nearly as great in the other provinces, and may be traced to. the following causes :-In 1825 the late King gave stringent orders to his Counil of State to amend the laws of marriage and divoree; but, though much attention was devoted to the subject, it was not tiU 1844, under the present King, that any alteration took place. The change then made had reference only to the form of process, rendering it less facile, but its beneficial results showed themselves immediately in the reduction of one-third of the annual number of divorces. Previous to this change it was possible for an auscutator-a judicial oficer of the lowest rank, and frequently a mere lad-to entertain a petition for divorce, exhaust all the requisite forms of citation and attempts at reeonciliation, and pronounce the desiredliberation a vinculo nrarmonii within the space of a day's sitting. In 1855, at length this Ministry brought in a bill for amaending the law of divorce, as contained in the A Ilemeines L-andrecd ; but,though the measure passed the House of Notables, they neglected to bring it on before the House of Deputies until the session was too far advanced for its disceussion to take place. That same measure, however, with the addition of a new feature, recormmended by the Evangelical Conferences, which sat here last autumn, is the bill they have presented to the Legislature this session. It was not alone the large amount of confusion introduced by these numnerous divorces into the domestc, social, and legal relations of the population that drove the present Ministry at length to introduce an amendmentof the law of divorce. Auother reason was this,-that of late years there had grown up a determined spirit among the clergy in hardly any case to solemnize any marriage in which either of the parties had been previously divorced. The views that had obtained in Prussia on the subject of marriage at the time the Aig7neimnes Landrecht was compiled and promulgated-viz., that it is a mere eivil institution-a social compact, on which, when concluded between the principals, the Church is required, merely for decorum's sake, to confer its blessing-have already considerably lost ground here. The notion, also, that a clergyman, as a mere cog in the State machine, is bound to co-operate in any act sanctioned by the Civil Code, is also vanishing rapidly under the auspices of the present Kling, who has prohibited any acts of disciplinary coercion being exercised towards any clergyman who entertain religious seruples towards the provisions of the Civil Code. In consequence of this freedom of conscience and action allowed to the pastoral clergy (a freedom which the provincial eonsistories were not backward in indicating to themselves also), the number of cases in which the celebration of matrimony has been denied to divorced persons amounted in the first ten months of 1855 to from seven to eight in each of the Protestant provinces of the kingdom; in the province of Saxony, in fact, they amounted even to nine in only the first four mouths of 1856 1 Another use the clergy has made of the freedom allowed them, and of the absence of any guidance on the part of the Church authorities, has been the erection of a standard for themselves to regulate their action in this matter. The rule some of them have adopted is this :-Where the previous divoree took place on other than Scriptural grunnviz, adultery or wilful desertion, the further and determined marriage of both of the divorced parties is to be refused; and where the Scriptural grounds have really existed then, nevertheless, to refuse further marniage to the culpable Party. with a view to assimilating the very various practice of different clergymen in this matter, and of harmonizing their conflicting -convictions on this oint as well as others, the King decided in 1855 on having a general Synod called, and as a preparatory step thereto invited various authorities on the subject, both judicial and clerical, to send in memorials to the Ober-Zirchenrath, or Supreme Consistory, in which, accordingly, among other subjects, that of the further marrage of divorced persons has been treated from a variety of different points of view. In the ecclesiastical conferences which were subsequently held in this city (November, 1856) for dehberating as to the best modius for convoking a general synod, as well as for a preliminary discussion of the subjects that should be submitted to it, it was eventually resolved with reference to the further marriage of divorced persons, that,- "As regards the admissibility or non-admissibility of a further marriage by tne Church of persons whose previous marriage has been disolved by a judgmrent of the lay Courts, the constituted ecclesiastical authorities (supremeand inferior consistories) have to pronounce their decision, wbich, however, must be in accordance with the principles of the Christian Protestant law. of marriage as laid down in the Word of God and the marriage regalations of the early Protestant churches." The Conference also-passed the resolution that"A definite term of separation as a period of probation preliminary to a final judgment of divorce, and which might even be ordered by the judge pendente ite, is a wholesome measure, and not at variance with the doctrine of the Evangelical Church, and therefore to be recommended to the attention of the civil Government." As, also, that- " The further marriage of the culpable party in a divorce ought to be refused by the Church so long as tho noa-culpable party remains alive." And, finally, that "It Iwas highly desirable that petitions for divorce should be removed from the cognizance of aU inferior Courts, and be brought ab initio before the higher tribunals.:' If it has been thought of interest to know what legal provisions with regard to divorce Protestant Prussia recognizes as expedient, that interest must attach not so much to the state of the law, which, as we have seen, bas produced such baneful results, but rather to the new prqjet de loi submitted in this session to the Legislature, and which contains the fraits of a painful experience, the result of very painstaking study. After being submitted to ample discussion in the preliminary committee and a nine days' debate in the House of Deputies, as well as subjected to 16 different amendments, the new law assumed the following form:_ It retains such provisions of the old law as must form valid pleas for divorce, the same as form the scriptural grounds, viz. :-I, Adultery (recrimination on the part of the wife forming no bar); 2, familiar intercourse kept up in spite of judges' order, affording strong presumption of adultery; 3, wilful and obstinate desertion; 4, sodomy and other unnatural crimes ; 5, impotence that existed previous to marriage. It repeals all such provisions of the old law as matst not any longer form valid pleas for divorce:- 1, mutual consent; 2, violent and deeply-rooted aversion; 3, merely suspicious intercourse kept up in spite of judges' order; 4, insufficient proof of wifeas continence during her absence from her husband; 5, refusal of conjugal obligation; 6, impotence or other bodily defect supervening subsequent to marriage; 7, madness and insanity; 8, incompatibility of temper and quarrelsomeness. It reserves such pleas as may form valid grounds for divorce, if the Court finds them to be so grievous as to be equally fatal to wedlock with adultery and desertion, such as-I, acts of violence, endangering the life or health or injuring the honour and personal freedom of either party; 2, conviction for penal crimes ; 3, dissolute course of life; 4, withholding means of support, &c. Where the Court, on the other hand, does not find the state of things proved to be so grievous as to be destructive of the entire character of wedlock, and where a reconciliation seems possible, it is at liberty to pronounce for a separation, but only for a definite period, varying from one to three years, against which judgment, however, either party can appeal. In case of reconciliation being effected that judgment of separation can be revoked before expiration of term on the joint petition of both parties. If a further petition for divorce be not filed within three months-after, the determination -of the period of separation all further steps in that direction are barred. In addition to the ordinary provisions for alimony and the education of the children after separation and divorce, the new proget de loi prohibits the culpable party in a divorce from marrying again within three years of judgment being pronounced, from which term, however, the period passed in separation may be deducted. The further marriage of the culpable party in a divorce with the person vith whom adultery had been committed remains prohibited, as before, and in future there shall be no dispensation from this prohibition. All petitions for divorce shall be brought ab initio before a quorum of not less than five judges. It shaU be competent for the public prosecutor to take the initiative in suits connected with the law of marriage, separation, and divorce. The principle of separation (a mensd et thoro) for a definite time is new in German legislation. Its intention is to offer a period of probation and an opportunity for excited passions to cool before proceeding to pronounce a final sentence of divorce a minulo mnatrimomii; it differs from the separation that had been tolerated by the Catholic Church as a makeshift for divorce in the circumstance of its being for a definite and limited term. In so far as this new projet de loi reduces the absolute pleas for divorce to the recognized scriptural grounds-viz., adultery and desertion-and otherwise provides that divorces shaU in future not be pronounced except on grounds constructively of equal gravity, it is not improbable that it will go far to remove the scruples of the Church as to the further marriagee of a divorced person after a three years' separation, particularly as the further marriage of the culpable person with a co-adulterer is to be strictly prohibited. Very probably the Supreme Consistory will promulgate a special form of words to be used in the further marriage of a divorced person, the glaring anomaly having been much dwelt on of the Church declaring a second time to such an one on his re-rmarriage, " Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder ;" and where a clergyman, nevertheless, still refuses to perform the marriage service, very probably the Consistory will depute a substitute to act for him. The expedient of a form of civil marriage being introduced for the further marriage of divorced persons the evangelical conferences above alluded to declined recommending to the Government, as it would have the appearance of putting the Church in an antagonistic attitude towards tie State; it will, however, eventually be found to be the only course left open to the State, inasmuch as any adoption of a Church element in the law, whether as regards principle or practice, ias ure to be offensive to a large proportion of the population, seeing that Catholic and Protestant principles and practice with regard to marriage and divorce are very different, and 6,500,000 of the population espouse the former, and 10,500,000 the latter. Two fundamental anomalies of the existing law are also left unremoved in the new bil :-1, that while it professes to be simply a civil law, it nevertheless requires the spiritual sanction of the Church to make a marriage valid; and, 2, that, after the marriage has received its final validity at the hands of the clergyman, the lay tribunals are made competent to dissolve that marriage without any further co-operation on the part of the Church, except a somewhat formal attempt at reconciliation by the parish clergyman. These latter ecclesiastical and confessional scruples have also been the cause of the measure having been eventually rejected by the House of Deputies. It was thrown out on the 4th of Mfarch of tis year by a majority of 173 to 134. The Catholie deputies refused to recognize the competence of the State to legislate at all with regard to the sacrameutof marriage; and, faiuing in procuring the acceptance of this principle, they requirzed thatthe measure &nld be first submitted to the approval of the Church suthorities of both confessions. It may be mentioned in conclusion that though the existing law and the new biU pro,osed both refer constantly to an Ehegericht, or Marriage Court, this must be understood only as inipli ~ng the ordinary Court as occupied at the moment with a Fuit involving the lawr of marriage; there v no special court for matters connected with mrarrige,. separation, and divorce, but the necessity of esti 'blishing one is recognized on all hands. The court e of the debates on this question revealed a fact highly characteristic of Prussia-viz., that though the library of the House of Deputies contained aI Talmud2 it coutained no Bible, - In tte course of the debates on "his question during this session the following results of the working of the existing law were cited from o-at of the recent experience of Prussia as evidences of its demoralizing effects :-One in. stance was iLuded to of a gentleman makig up a rubber at whist at a watering-place conisting of himself, his actual wife, and the two wives he had previousy been divorced from. A farmer, getting tired of his wife, an exemplry, modest woman, bribes one of his farm servants to seduoe his wife into adultery,-a crime attended by no punishinent for the unmarried party. Thecrime having been ooasummated, he petitions for divorce on that ground, and obtains it. He .thenaarres another woman, who some time afterdetectisg um in an illoit intercouree with one of his female siernts procures her own divorcefrom him; onwhich beprooeedsto marry, for the third time, the person witb whom he had on this occasion committed adultiery.

RXRIBITION OF ART TREASURBS AT MAKCOBSTBR. The attendance yesterday, the first shilling day,! although the weather was extremely fine and inviting, was not so great as expected, and up to 3 o'clock the number probably did not much exceed 3,000 persons. Among these were exceedingly few season ticket-holders, most of whom had probably kept back in the expectation of a crowd of working people. The expectation of a crush, indeed, had probably kept back many who have been waiting for tho cheap admissions; and in the course of a few days it is expected there will be an improvement as far as regards numbers. There were cheap trains from Liverpool, Sheffield, and Birmingham, the latter bringing about 500 people; but the trains from the other towns brought very few passengers. There was a marked difference in the cla-s of people attending at the shilling admission, few, if any, of them being what is implied by the term " working people ;" and all of them being well dressed, though contrasting very much with the showily-attired visitors who have hitherto formed the great majority. They mostly appeared much delighted with the place, and their examination of the pictures in all the galleries was generally of a steady and earnest character. Since Saturday the dais has been removed, and a portion of the orchestra has also been taken away. At the intersection of the transept, where the dais stood, a fine group of marble statuary has been placed, with a good effect, the central figure of the group being M'Dowell's " Virginius." Mlr. Donald has also improved his accommodation for secondclass visitors by opening a large coffee-room behind the dining saloon, to which he proposes to add a smoking-room. These are detached from the main building, so an to prevent any danger-if danger there could be, seeing that the walls of the bailding are of iron, and have nothing combustible about them. These improvements were very much needed, and will be still more appreciated when crowds come to the Exhibition.
THE .ZRW PEAVAL SERVITUDE BtLL. The adjourned meeting on this subject was held at tbe Mansion-house yesterday, the Lord Mayor in the chair. The attendance was very thin, and the interest of the proceedings appeared to have evaporated. The chairman ascribed the smnalness of the number present to the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Friday night, in the course of which he said Mr. Pearson's views on prison discipline received a general sanction. Mr. Pearson then formally put in his appearance, but begged to be exonsed from remaining, on account of an official engagement that he had elsewhere. Before leaving the hall, however, he requosted that the meeting at its rising might be furtber adjourned till this day week, when he undertook to confine his reply to one hour. The discussion was then resumed at the point where it was interrupted on Friday, and it dragged on with httle spirit for upwards of two hours. The most animated speech of the whole was delivered by Mr. George Cruikshank, who recounted the experience he had aequired of the character of the thieves of London while living among them in disguise with a view of intimately studying their habits. The orator, by an easy transition, reached the temperance question, and was giving vehement expression to his well-known opinions upon it when he was suddenly caUed to order for his irrelevancy, and was obliged to come to an abrupt termination. Ho was followed by Mr. Payne, who advocated the education rather than the punishment of neglected juvenile offenders, together with a lighter and more sammary mode of dealing with petty offences generally. Mr. Pavne moved a series of resolutions to be added to Mr. Pearson's, in accordance with his own views. Mr. Armstrqpgcriticizedthatpartof Mr. Pearson's plan whichadvises the erection of large prisons with walls enclosing 1,000 or 2,000 acres of land, and characterized it as " benevolent but impracticable." He also recommended the transfer of our convicts to the colonies for life, and suggested that a pro. spective interest in the land they tiUled should be held out to them as an incentive to good conduct. Sir Thomas Tancred next advised a separation between the punitive and reformatory elements in our prison discipline. Transportation should, in his judgment, be the ultimate reward offered to reclaimed criminals, who ought to be sent out, after expiating their sentence at home, as free men. Several other speakers succeeded, whose views were singularly diseordant. Indeed, most of the gentlemen present seemed amusingly at sea as to the object of the discussion, and the greatest conflict of opinion prevaiued as to the precise question before the meeting. some held that it was Mr. Pearson's plan pur ct imple. Others thought that that plan was to be taken in conjunction with the wider sabject of the prevention of crime. Others, again, eontended for the question of punishments apar from that of preventio2; and one speaker went so far as to insist that his new method of Vrowing turnips was peculiarly germane to the issue. It would be hard, however, to accuse anyone of traveling out of the record when no two could agree on what that record was. At length two hours and a quarter of rambling and purposeless discussion was brougho a terminatfon bv another adjoarnment, the anderstanding being that the third meeting should be rigidly restricted to Mr. Pearson'6 pro- pcosition. _ _ _ _ _ _ _
THE DECIMALJ COINAGE SciimE.-Yesterday appeared a large blue-book, containing the preliminary 2eport of the Dedmal Coinage Commissioners. The report proper iS very brief; it simply traces the progress of the decimal coinage luestron historically, ascertains the position in which it remtaned at the time when the commission was issued, and aunounces the examinations of sundry witnesses, -whose voluminous evidence is appended. A great deal of information has also been collected in foreign countries on the subject of the coinage. Some importnt branches of the question remain for investigation. Tokether with this seport is printed a paper of " questions" communicated by Lord Overstone to the Decimal Coinage Commissioners, drawn up with a view of bringing under distinct notice and examination some of the advantages of our present svstern of coinage, and some of the principal objections and difficulties which have been suggested respecting the proposed introduction of the decimal principle.

So far as the symphonies, overtures, and vocal music were oonoerned a finer selection than the above could not have been desired. The band continues to progress under the skilful direction of Profeesor Sterndale Bennett, and is rapidly regaining all its former excellence. Both symphonies were splendidly performed-with a delicate observance of light and shade no less thin with energy nd fire. Both were keenly enjoyed and warmly applauded, tho compliment of. an encore falling, as usual, to the piquant aUegrctto of Beethoven, which, often as it is produced in public, incurs no risk of becoming hacknied. In bendelssohn's symphony some of the movemnents wOre taken a little slower than has been lately the custom; but the times were as nearly as possible Mendelssohn's own; and much was gained in clearness and accuracy of detail by their restitution. The music of Mendelssohln, it is true, must never be drgged; but if the pace is so quick thnt the notes cannot be executed distinctly the intentions of the composer are inevitably frustrated. In the symphony of Beethoven the trio of the minuet was given in strict accordanco with the score, the accompaniment being allotted to one violoncello instead of to severaL About the comparative effect of tho two methods-that of Beethoven and that resorted to by various conductors since Beethoven's death-a difference of opinion prevails ; but the safest guide to follow must sulrdy be the composer himself. The Introduction of Tohn Sebastian Bach's overture, symphony, or "suitc' (as it is variously entitled), in D major-for stringed instruments, two oboes, three trumpets, and drums-was a bold experiment. Nevertheless, it turned out perfec'UysuccessafuL This music, although it now sounds somewhat old-fashioned, is so masterly and spirited that even the monotony arising from all the movements being in the same key is scarcely felt. The plan of the work is the same as that which Handel adopted in his Suites de Pi&ea for tho harpsichord, of which Bach, too, has left such noble examples in his Suites Anglaises, &c. There are seven pieces to make up the series, and among them two gavottes, a - bourr-ee and a " gigue"-dance movements which the masters of the time frequently introduced in their instrumental compositions, with greater or less elaboration. The most striking are the first (" grave"), of which Handel was not incognizant, and the vivacc that follows-one of the most vigorous and ingenious of its composer. After the resumption of the slow movement this " tivce" should, if we are not mistalken, be repeated. In spite of its square-cut poriods and antiquated phraseology the overture of Bach was thoroughly relished-the performanoo being first-rate, and the audienoo ful of faith and reverence for the illustrious father of counterpoint and fugue. Spohr's magnificent. prelude to his opera of the Bcrg-gcist, brilliantly executed, made an effective termination to the concert. The airs intrusted to Madame Novello are fine specimens of the dramatic melody of Mozart and Gluck, masters who had nothing but genius in common. As abstract musio the song from Idomesrco is by far the most beautiful, while as a modium for vocal declamation it would not bo oesy to surpass the recitative and air from Iphiginie in Tauridc. Madame Novello sang her very best -which is saying a great deal-and conferred the highest gratification upon her hearers. Of Herr Rubinstein, his compositions, and his performance we would rather not speak, but just now that there is so much charlatanism abroad, to the serious detriment of genuine art, silence is not permitted, especially when a notorious instance presents itself. We never listened before to such music-if music it may be called-at the Philharmonic Concerts, and fervently trust we never may again So strange and chaotic a jumble as the concerto in G defies analysis, To assert that it is wanting in intelligible design would be insufficient, since not only is there no evidence of developement but nothing to develope. Not a single subject, fit to be designated "phrase" or "melody,"canbe traceothrough. out the whole dreary length of the compodtion; while, to atone for the absence of every musical attribute, we look in vain even for what abouncds in the pianoforte writings of Liszt and others of the same eccentric school-viz., the materials for displaying mechanical facility to advantage. Herr Rubinstein's concerto, in short, is quito as dull as it is shape*ess and confused. The orchestral accompaniments, moreover, betray the hand of a tyro ; anything more meagre and unsatisfactory has rarely been committed to paper. The two pieco Without accompaniments which the Russian pianist introduced in the second part of the programme-a nourne and a Polonaise-are not much better. In the first something like the shadow of a theme is indicated; but the last is empty rhodomontade from end to end. Such things have nothing whatever to do with music; and the wonder is how so beautiful an art can, under any circumstances, be exhibited in a light so unat. tractive and absurd. As a player, Herr Rubinstein (who, when a mere boy, paid London a visit in 1843-4) may lay claim to the posssession of extraordinary manual dexterlty. Hts execu. tion (more partcularly when he has passages in octaves to perform)is prodigious, and the difficulties he sarmounts with apparent ease are manifold and astonishing. But his mechanism is by no meaus invariably pure; nor is his manner of attacking tbe notes at all favourable to the production of legitimato tone. A pianist shoald treat his instrument rather is a friend than as au enemy, cares rather than bully it; but Herr Rubinstein seats himself at the piano with a seeming determination to punish it, and his endeavours to extort the power of an orchestra from that which is, after all, but an unpretending row of keys, hammers, and strings, result in an exaggeration of style entirely antago. nistic to real musical expression. The nocturnewhich, though vague and perplexing, is for the most part of a tranquil character-afforded an agreeable contrast to the bewildering clatter of the concerto ; but this was quickly dispelled by the Polonaise, which is, if possible, more inharmonious and unrhythmical than the latter. That Herr Rubinstein may have qualities as a pianist which his own music does not enable him to disclose is more than probable; and we shall be sincerely glad of an opportunity to judge him more favourably.
SmGuLAn RjJLWAY AcomNT.-A railway accident, which might have been attended with a serious loss of life, occurred on the South Devon Railway on Saturday morning. It appears that as the luggage train from Exeter to Plymouth approached the Teignmouth station at a moderate speed the pointsman, from some unexplained cause, turned the train into a dead riding which is contiguous to the platform of the station. The result was that the flagging of the platform was torn up, the stone pilars vhich supported the iron roof were knocked down, and the roof fell vwth a fearful crash across the line, while the engine, tender, and first carriage of the train were literally buried in the d4bris of the booking. office. The driver and stoker, seeing the approaching danger, jumped off the engine just in timo to save their lives. Tho amount of property destroyed belonging to the South Devon Company is estmrated at several thousand pounds. Trafflo on the line was impeded for upwards of four hours, and the morning mail from Exeter to Plymouth reached the latter town four hours later than its appointed time. RAIIMWAY COLUSIox.-As a pasuen er-train from Huddersfield was proceeding to Sheffield, on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnsire Railway, on Saturday morning, it camne into collision with a ballast-train near the engine-shed opposite to Neepsend, which was standing on the line, and which, owing to a curve, the driver of the passenger-train did not see in time to prevent the accident. The two trains camo into contact with great violence ; the pasenger carriages were thrown off the line, and some of the ballaswaggons were completely smashed. None of the paMengers were seriously injured; the driver and fireman saved themselves by jumping off the train, but the gurd was not so fortunate, he austaining a dangerous cut on the head, and a sprain of one ankle. The accide-t is beheved to have heen the result of negloct on the part of some of the company's servants in charge of the signls.
