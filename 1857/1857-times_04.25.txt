WVXECK OF Ax ABERDEE STEN- April 19.-The steamer Qaeen, of Aberdeen, Captap liurray, from Aberdeen to Granton, struck ontheCsrr Rock this morning, at half-past 1 o'clock. Immediatelr afterwards she was found to make water, and it increased sorapidly that by the time she reached this her fires were extinguished; and finding that she could remain above water but a few minutes longer, they made for the harbour, and by the aid of the leading lghts recently erected the suncceeded in getting her into the fairway 10 minutes before S o'clock am. Untortunaely, it being low water, she lie on a andbank about 400 yards from tho harbour. The inhabitants being aroused by the signal guns and rging of the be4s assstance was promptly given, amnd the passengers were all safely landed by 5 oclock K.m. There were 40 passengers on board. AU thet livetock, consisting of 349 sheep, three cattle (oneof which, died on coming shore), and one horse, were all landed, with the above exception, safely. They have succeeded in saving considerabae qu ntity of the cargo in good condition, but much of it must be damaged, as she at present lies full of water. The following letter, dated Crail, Sabbath, mnorning, from a lady in Crmil to a friend in Dundee, given an interesting account of the wreck of the steamer :-" Wewvere roued this morning, when it was quite dark, by a, report of a gun and a load ringing of a bell. We frt. thought it was a fire but, on looling out, we saw the lighb. canne from the sea. We ran to the south wimdow, and sawa vessel close into the shore, which was proved to be theQueen paddle-steamer, of Aberdeen, from Inverness toGranton. She bad struck the Carr Rock, and the passengers. insisted on running for the nearest place of safety. The, lights guided them to this place ; but, as it was low water and the vessel making wattr fast, sbe was run in, and took the grolund about2W0yards from the pier. Shelowered her own oat, but it broke adrift and came in among the rooks. A small boat tried to reach her from the shore, but could, not, for the ea was rolling in very heavily; however, before 5 o'olock 40 passengers were landed. On the fide rsing, a large boat was launched, which is bringing on shore the sheep, and clanythinthat can be laid hold of. The ea Is breaking right over her quarter-deck. If there wes nqre ofl te la boats got ready they night save a goed part of the cargo, bitt it is only small fibinz yAwls thot are usqd here, except, at the herring eason. There is a rope out to the shore asisting the largeboat's crewtogo and eomn Xicker. Some of the pasengers are not wlol pleased satal qattention being dircted to ave the live cargo.

ONRY-MA RETarTYINTELLIGENVB. F-lday Evening. 'She funds opened this morming at the steady quo-. nticus of ysovterday, and subsequently: experienced s deciine of an eighth, owing to a sudden increase inl 'the demand for loans. Consols for money were first uring the last two or three days wvras wholly cheeked yan eager inquiry for advances on all descriptioun d! Government securities, the demand probably having in the first Instance been attracted by the fower rates 'phich have recently revailod in the Stock-Exchange as compared with the discount. maarket. Its chief pressure was attributed to the requirements for the purchase of silver for the next lndian mail, which is again likely to take out a very 3arge sum, and, although heavy amounts were aultimately lent at 7 per cent, on stock, Exchequerbills, &c., they seemed scarcely to satisfy the requirements of the moment. In the discount-market and at the Bank there was also great, although not equal, activity. But for the fact of the arrival of the Anglesoy tom Australia with 200,00Ol., which will be sufficien}t to supply the immediate wants of the Bank of France, the movement would bave caused greater depression, especially as the withdrawals from the Bank of England have been partiaUy resumed, 20,000l. in gold having been taken this afternoon for the continent. The final transaction3 were at W3 tq i for money, 93i to i for the 7th of May, and 93j to i for the new account in June. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 265; Reduced, 91i 'to J; New Three per Cents., 91 to 92; India :Stcck, 220 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 981 to i; bIndia Bonds, 8S. to 4C. discount; and Exchequer4bil]s (June) Us. to la. discount, (March) 2a. discount to is. premium.

Certificates, 97. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates 'ere generally a shade firmer than last post. The corn-market was steady this morning at the rates of Monday. The report of tho Liverpool coLton-market this -week shows a limited business, without alteration in jprices. The final quotations of the French Three porCents. -on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 45c. for anoney and 69f. 55c. for the end of the month, ahowing a recovery of a quarter per cent. 'The Lisbon mail this afternoon has brought further particulars of the contract arranged by Sir '1'orton Peto for constricting the railway from tisbon to Oporto. The company is to be formed =sd to issie its shares within six months of the signing of the contract, and the works are to be comanen=ed witbin three months thereafter. Cautionmaoney to the amount of 10,0001. in Portuguese ibonds is to be deposited within a month of the date -of the contract, and another 10,0001. within a month -of -conunencing work, the whole to be returned after 2CO,0001. shall have been expended on the line. The length to be constructed is 204 mfles, and the ,Government are to pay the company 8,8561. per mile, or a total of 1,867,5001. The concession is for 99 years, with right of purchase by the State at 'the end of 30 years on payment of a sum equal to a4 years' profits-such sum in no case to be less -than the total cost. The line is to be single, with width in all respects for a double one, and Governanent lands, timber, &c., are to be granted, together with mining rights for more than half a mile on -each side. All materials are to be admitted free, and no taxes are to be levied for 30 years, except an impost of 5 per cent. on the gross earnings, but -the Government mails are to be carried without 'charge. The company are to pay 550,0001. for the ,portion of the line constructed between Lisbon and ; 3antarem (60 kilometres) by the Central Peninsula Company, and the Government are to pay off the -shareholders in that undertaking at par, in bonds 'of the funded debt at 50, or in 18 quarterly cash instalments with interest at 0 per cent. per annum. 'They are likewise to settle any debt that may be 'due to tho contractors for that portion, either " in :bonds of the external debt at 50" or in cash instalmentw& Finally, the Government take power from the Chambers to create and emit " bonds of 'the funded debt" to the full extent of the liabilities 'thus undertaken. It is not stated, however, -whether t-hese bonds are to be of the external or dnternal debt. The produce-markets during the week have been steady, with a fair demand for actual consumption. 'There has, however, been no general improvement in the aspect of business, speculative operations of magnitude being still checked by the high prices of nanny articles, together with the uncertain state of the money-market. The trade have taken large supplies of sugar, and, notwithstanding the heavy quantity offered at the public sales to-day, the slight and partial advance established on Tuesday was anaintained, excepting for some of the lower quallties of IMauritium, which were rather cheaper. Several floating cargoes of Hlavannah were disposed 'of, chiefly for the united kingdom, and only one of Brazil for a near port. The deliveries for home use -are progressing favourably. In coffee there have 'been further large public sales of plantation Ceylon, =ad the extreme rates of last week were not generally supported. Native is unaltered. To-day a -cargo of Rio sold for a near port at 50s. 6d. There ,has been but little business in tea, and the public sales held on Thursday went off without spirit. A -disposition has been shown to purchase Kai-sows of the medium to good grades. No transactions are reported in common Congou. Rice continues dull, :nd has experienced a decline of 3d. With the exception of pimento, which. is slightly lower, no material change has taken place in spice. The -quarterly sales of cinnamon on the 27th inst. wiU 'comprise about 2,500 bales. There is lees inquiry for rum, some quantities of Demerara in second Ibands having been sold upon rather lower terms. 'Tbe transactions in waltpetre have been considerable at a rise of Is. to Is. 6d., but to-day the demand was less active. The folowing letter from the River Plate, after referring to the political position of Montevideo, *describes certain proposals for the establishment of banks of issue,-one by a resident and another by a company at Paris, with a capital of 1,200,0001. The prosperity of the country has been greatly proanoted by the extraordinary prices realized for hides and wool, and there is consequently a tendency to inflation, which is likely to develope itself in in-creased values for buildings and land. From Buenos Ayres it is alleged that a brother of the exdictator Rosas has recently died and bequeathed an estate to Queen Victoria, in acknowledgment of the shelter afforded to the exiled members of his family "Montevideo, hlarch 7. "The Chamberu were opened the middleoof last weok. flr. Castel1anos, whe, as Oribe's candidate as senator for the 'department of ontevideo, was defeated and then retarned for ono of the Interior departments, was, in spite of the efforts of the Governanent, elected President of the Senate. se ,." ~, hoanevary op otnt of delrngt he was~~~~ aU<dlxlan oenOfpptortuity of declaring that ho was a cordial supporter of the Government policy, as 'exposed in the programme of President Pereira. Dr. Castel- lanos may be sincere in his declaration, but it must be confessed that his antecedents as Minister have not inspired ,nuch confidence. His respeeb for truth and the contracts -of his predecessors inx Office were not very conspicouos in 1852, and his utter disregard of aU legal and mioral obligations there can be little doubt originated the opposition to the President Giro, which termninated in a revolution and his merited downfall. If the President of the Republic should die before the four years for which he was elected have expired. Dr. Castellanos, in virtue of his office, would -succeed him for the unexpired term. His character, thAre fore, is scanned with interest, for DIn Gabriel Pereira is 3either a young man nor the most healchy. The President's message was wordy, and full of promises to do much if he had the means. It wsa ' Give me money and I will do *Xreat things,' but he failed to point out how money was to Nbe provided. A Bill has been brought in for granting perzniWon t;o Baron Macea to establish a bank of issue. He asks for power to issue notes (payable on demand) to the extent of three times the capital invested, and offers to submit the inspection of his books to a Government ommission whenever called upon, and 'he requests that his notes may be reeeived in 'Government offioes in payment of duties and taxee. In one of my former letters I mentioned that when the Baron established his bank here he commenced issuing pper as i waa onuidered there was no lessJ impedimeat - M Wte Government isued a deoree prohi'biting it, and he 1h Wzoe onhned his aperations to disoounts and exchange ae~otlatio,L WFhat a thea lookod upon with snspioton 4i Stst GIs e aded t. the skies; the eouny ws $tag )o be saine bFpaemoaoy, nowrit is to be SMd b Am t^ Brex sks for noe xelaiveprlv- 3cp af 's'g par d h t ofh no doubioon be Uestablisabd, and the eountry maJ °fn i feW yeas be inundated with. paper money. The commercial bodylook upon thli wivth no confidence-ia fact, with positiver distrust. nLt seai6n a Bill was pase4 autonorizingthe etablistent-of a F,rench bank, with the exclusive privilege of Isauing paper, exchangeable for specie on demand, it commehcedl Wthin a given period.

The eapital ig said to be 30,10,f000., and hiontsevidean shareholders are to be elected directors here. AsY the Freneh bank contractors undertook to discount bills. given for duties at 6 per cent. premium, aud traders!'. at 9 per cent., there were manifest advantages attending it, and this will he the more apparent to you when I state that discounts have scarcely ever been5 done below 1 per cent. per month, and are now at 1A to 1, per cent. per month. It is believed, also, that if the French bank is established, emigration from Europe wiU be greatly stimulated by the projectors. If they should not be able to renew their pnvilege they have t emselves onlk to blame. 1 There can, I think, be no doubt that we shall soon have, banks of issue established here, and it requires no nroat foresight to predict that the value of real property ill be' affecced by them. Land is stiU low. The iicreasing Hse in the unprecedented high price of hides and the continuedd high urice of wool are ennching these countriei toan extent of which three years ago they could form no coiiceptio n, and five yeanrs of undisturbed peace wiU -produc a pros.- perity little imagined. Peace may continue as long as tie Custom-house is administered asat present by the merchants with the intervention of Her Majesty's representative. To get hold of the Custom-house was the aIM of al .revolutionists. They promised orders against the duties at enormous discounts for sums furnished them to carry oat their nefarious ends. Nefarious they were, because theyrepre-- sented no principle but that of disorder. It was a inerestrug. gle for power and profit,attheexpense of thesuffiengpeoPle. No one better knows this than the President of the OR-: public, and assuredly he will not consent to any change that might jeopardize his pogition and influence, and theere is no class more interested in maintaining the present order of things than the merchants or importers, who always suffer by revolutions. There Is also a Bill before the Chanibersbrought in by a private mqmber-for once more doing away with passports, which, it is hoped, will be carried. go one benefits by the passport system but the consuls, and our Goveibment shoild make it imperatiie on all British consul to countersign passports without fee.1 tItXisanabuse that merits tho consideration of the Liverpool Reform A&so. ciation. It can hardly be expected that our consuls will take any steps to have passports abolished when they-benefit by the system. 'lost of the River Plate -merchants have establisnments both at Buenos Ayres and. Montevideo and they frequently pass from one place to the other. 13Oh time they have to take a passport, and to pay for it. If yon go to Buenos Ayres you must take out a pssport, -ad if you return from there the same day you amnve you must take out another passport. Some months ago this Government, which, under the sanction of the Legislature, and through the interventiori of the French Charg6 d'Affaires, had previously contracted to pay M. Gonnouilhou a certain amount monthly in liquidation of a large sum owing to him *or a long period, suddenly refused to pay. Application was tade to the Permanent Committee, and remonstrances were made by the French Char96 d'Affaires, hut without effect. The case has recently been brought before the Chambers, and a committee ba just presented its oninion, which is strongly condemnatory of the conduct of the Government. In fact, if the payment is not resumed, It is generally belleve4 the French Government will adopt stroam measures to enforce it, and fe* here will be surprised or greved.- The committee take this occasion to pass well-merIted oomplments on the administration of Don Dorotea Garcia; who negotiated the arrangement of that And other claims most advantageously for the State. There are a good many sales and purchases of lands, and, notwithstanding the acarcityef moncey buildings re colstantly being erected, many of t'em in a superior style to that has prevailed hee Eome of the groends attached' to country resldences ln the suburbs are being lid out in thy Eiooearln ele. If there wsere decent roads the environs of veontevideo woud soon avsume n more agreeable aspect. aT electrnc telegraph is in course of erection between the town and Union, a distance of abeout three mniles, but no-'one can comprehxend for From Buenos Ayres welear that the municipal elections, which wiere somewhat stormy, terUinated in favor of the GJovernment. The Rtosista party in ntearly every instance sustained a signal defeat; but the Government is accused of having used undue influence. The elections' for the ap~per and lower Chambers will take place shortly. Mlfr. Christie left Buenos Ayres for the Paraia, after the arrangement made with that Government relative to the dismiFsal of the late Captain Gore, alluded to in my lsst, and it is said he will endeavour to induce Urquiza to revokethe law of differ. ential duties which recently came into operation, and agaist which he had protested as contrary to the spirit of our treaty of 182.v with the Argentine Confederation. The railway has given so mach satisfaction that it is to be extended immediately. It is not very creditable to the British Government that some of the foreign leglonaries who left England in the Acadia for the River Plate were prmitted to bring out English women Who were not their wives. It is said that somne 20 of these poor creatures have been abandoned by their protectors, and are adrift in Buenos Ayres. Admiral Brown, who so bravely and honestly served Buenos Ayres for so many years, died a ewv days ago at an advanced age. Gar-vnsio Rosas, brother of the notorious Dictator of' that name, also died a few days sice, and it is said he left an estanC on the Salado co0mprsing 30 square leagues, to Queen Victoria, ag a mark ofhis gra,titude for her hospitality towards his brother At the Court of Banlkruptcy to-day the choice of assignees under the estate of Messrs.

FATAL ExPERImENT.-An inquest was held a few days ago at Exniinster (Devonshire), before Mr. Cro3se coroner of the district, on tho body of a girl, aged 13, who had been in the employ of a farmer in the neighbonrhood. It appeared that the girl -was discovered in an outhouse, suspended by a rope to a rafter, qLiife dead; and it was ahted that the deceased had lately visited the Devon county gaol, in company with her master and mistress, and that she bad been shown among other things the place where culpnts-werohanged. When she arrived home she asked how hanging was effected, and her fellow.segt4lt are reported to have described tha process to her. She evinced considerable curiosity on the subjectk and it was thought she went into the linhay to try the experiment, and snot with the intention of committin scid%as a5 *be w cheerul ad cointenUted, and no reason whatever could h ups e for has toinmitting so rash an ac.

The merchaut servioe is edrtainly entitlcA, howoeer, to be represeatod ia the" oonrts ; the appointment of a Royal naval officer only is invidious. Your correspondent wouldseem to imply that allcwanc3 ought to be made for mercantile commanders who have had the misfortune to lose their vessels by mgaintaiing "in alt weathers and under all circumstannoe the highest rate of speed as encouraged by Government sbsidies to ownersm It appears to me, however, that a commander Is bound to consider tho lives of his pausengers and crew rather than the interest of his owners, and itis just thisldnd of rocIlessness with which no member of the Cout ought to have any sympathy. The question of uniform I do not enter upon; the profetesional members of the Asocintion will be better able to give an authoritative opinion apon it when they have di" cussed it, inter se, more fully.. There are objectiens to it, but I will not state them. With the ofRioer braneh of tha mercantile marine placed upon the footing we contemplate, what an opening would be made for thousands of youths of the better educated clase, who are now restrained fronm entering the service by considerations at which T have already hinted I With an intelligent, high-principled, scientifie clas of officers, crews will be esred for afloat and ashore. What a noble nursery should wo maintain without any expense for the Royal navy1! The men will have a patriotic love for their country if their country shows some regard for them, and I do not ee why, in case of-war, the ballot should not take the place of the press-gang, and -ba favourably received.

BELLEISL: FAIM. TO TIB EDITOlf OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-Tlhe successive abcition of Bartholomew, CamberweU, and at length of Greenwich fair would lead most people to imagine that the inhabitants of London wers nnally quit of these barbarous saturnalia. Thanks, however, to the enlightened diroction of the Worth Loidon. Railway, we have a little Bartholomew fair establishing iteelf as an appendage, I suppose, to the new Smithfield. This week we have a repetition of the nuisance inflicted on. us last year at this time by the gathering of shows, caravans of dirgusting monstrosities, humuan and otherwise, with the still less reputable accompaniments of a " fair " on a pieoce of unoccupied land belonging to the North London RaUlway Compay, near the Caledoian-rosd station. One canhardly imagtne that tho company is purposely establishing this degrading scene en perm4nence as ain awual source of a few thousand fourpenees, but, ifso, it would be well to contsider the effect upon their regular passenger traffic of adding a Dew disqualification to the North-I;ondon Astrct as a place of residence. We can keep some of our roadsfree from cattle on market.days by means of gates and private watchn.en, and the abominable smells of the factories as BlUeislo an in some degree mitigated. This week we have had our tboroughfares swarming with the Idle and disrmputable polunLation of the various rookeries north of the lewr-road, not to dwell upon the doroestis d isreble arising ou of necessary restraint to be exercised on aeryants Ihr those 'bo consider that the head of a family is bound to gad as far aS possible from temptation. the uneducated pYn 'whose characters aee inhisu r her hads.

LONDON, SATURDAY. APRIL 25, 1857. The news which wo publish in another place shows how fully justified the Government and people of :Dgland have been in p-romptly supporting their officers in China. Certainly, our troope, our frigates, and our gunboats have not been despatched an hour too soon. We are evidently engaged in a momentous conflict, which it will require the utmoBt vigour, courage, and decision to bring to a cloe The diplomatic labours of Lord ELIGn must be delayed until the sterner task of the military and naval chiefs has been effectually completed. There is an end for a time of mi3sions and negotiation. The whole disposablo force of the home and Indian Governments must be devoted, to the chastisement and coercion of the brizria iace which seems to be risin up againt us in evry. regi9n whier it has set foot. We learn that the Europeans on board the :British steamer Queen, under the Portuguese fag, have been murdered by the Chinese pamsengers and crew, and the steamner with its cargo carried off. The outrages at Hongkong have been renewed, and the Government contractors' storehouses, with flour for the troops and fleet, burnt down by incendiaries. Further information from this quarter we have none, but it is probable that the Admiral still maintains the same position, waiting for reinforcements, and that in the meantime. the Chinese, not only of Canton, but perhaps throughout the Empire, are possessed with the notion that we are powerless and on the point of being destroyed. But the strangest intelligence is to follow. The Chinese ve7udfta has spread through the Archipelago. Some time since Singapore, our great emporium in those seas, was threatened with ruin by an insurrection of the hordes of Chinese which inhabit it. Now we hear that Sarawak, the settlement of Sir JAESr BuooxE in Borneo, has been destroyed. on the 17th of February the Chinese rose and massacred several Europeans. Sir JA?rxs BROoxE only saved his life by swimming across a creek. But the ]Rajah is not a man to fail at such a conjuncture. Placing himself at the head of a band of Malays and Dyal;s, two fighting races whom he seems to have effectually subjected, and aided by a steamer which opportunely arrived, he avenged the destruction of the place by the slaughter of 2,000 Chinese. What may have happened during the two months which have since elapsed who can tell ? It is evident that the Chinese who have poured out of their own country over all the settlements of those regions, who are to be found in multitudes in Singapore, Borneo, Penang, and Malacca, who may be numbered by teon of thousands in our Australian colonies, are by this time thoroughly rouised into a war of extermination against us. Poison, fire, and the knife are prepared for us by thousands of barbarian fanatics; and any daywomay learn the destruction of our most flourishing settlements, 'with the slaughter of every man, woman, and child of European blood. How deep has been the plot, how terrible the danger, we may now perceive. It is often surprising to find how complete is the communication among barbarous races, and how strong the common instinct which governs them. in this case the fact is strongly exemplified. In places remote from each other there is evidently the same spirit of hatred and the same treachery and cruelty in the gratification of it. YnH was right in saying that he acted in accordanee with the demands of the populace. It is plain that for a long time there has been growing up among the Chinese a feeling of hostility which has been encouraged by our own passive toleration of insult. The opinion ox all persons connected with China, that vigorous measures were neesary in the late dispute, has been principally founded on a knowledge that this rancorous spirit existed aimong the Chinese, coupled with a belief that it could be displayed with impunity. Things have now come to a crlsis, and nothing is left but to punish the outrages of this faithless race by the use of the whole strength of the Empire. We must recognize the present as no " little ' war," for we are fighting three hundred mUllions Df people distributed over the half of Aia, and abetted by multitudes in some of the most important dependencies of the Empire. Happly, the news of the peaee with Peria seems to have arrived at Bushire, and there are no accounts of further hostilities. As soon, then, as the ratification is completed the force under Sir JA=is OUTRAM might at once be shipped for China, where it would arrive long before the troops from Portsmouth could complete their voyage. At the present time it only takes 10 days by telegraph to communieate with Bushire, so that the order might be received and acted on almost immediately. As to the mutiny in India, which looked so alarming, we trust it may be considered as at end, for the most unruly regiment has been disbanded without blood. shed. With the 'war in Persia concluded, India tranquil, Europe at peace, und our arsenals and ports choked with warlike stores and ships, there is every facility for carrying through the Chinese war with promptitude and success Vlgour in the commanders and effective support from home are, however, needed, unless we would see the prosperity, and even the existenoe, of our Asiatic Empire seriously endangered.
In a well-known work on natural theology a man of ordinary inteligence is supposed to stumble for the first time on a watch. Of course, on first sight, and even more on a discovery of its construction and powers, he concludes it to have been made by somebody, with a useful purpose, and for such a being as himself. No doubt a watch is entirely within the capacity of a man. But take another supposition. Suppose a watch, or, what is the same thing, a mere watchmaker, a being capable of making a watch and nothing more, to stumble for the first time on a man-he finds the thing utterly beyond his capacity. For anything he could see, it would be utterly aimless, purpoweless, useless, and even mischievous; at once shortcoming and excessive; good for nothing but to wind up a watch and keep it in order, and incapable of doing that with regularity or ultimate success. The mere watchmaker would soon perceive that the man was disturbed and distracted from his duties by incomprehensible passions and' pursuits that led to no purpose, which seduced him from his proper work, and betrayed him to misery' and ultimate annihilation. Our supposition may seem rather a fanciful one, but, in our humble opinion, it is realized in fact to an infinitely greater extent than the contrary one of a man discovering and speculating upon a watch. In fact, the 'world is full of watchmakers, mere animated watches, ingenious mechanics, arch-mechanics, men so eminently, natirally, and distinctively mechanical as to be so by choice of will and bent of genius, not by force of circumstances, which may enslave I a man's hands but leave his soul free. Tlhe world I is full of rebeUious tailors, high-minded artsans, revolutionary weavers, ahartist stockingers, and seditious operatives of aU sorts. These are discontented, unruly, and outrageous because they have souls above their work, and, if not pardonable, it is at least to be expected that a man, as nature made him, should not be quite satisfied with his position as the joint in a machine-the mere maker of pins, of lace, or of stocldngs. But the real mechanic, who is so by choice and natural aptitude, is to be foumd in the class of masters. It is among them that we must look for our imaginary watchmaker stumbling for the first time on a man. We are prepared for the fact of such a being concluding a man, or anything essentially and pre-eminently human, to be a very eccentric, unaccountable, and dangerous creature. If a watch had to govern and reconstruct a man it would find a great deal to alter and lop of, and the man would probably not remain much of a man after passing through the hands of a watch. But, for our purpose, it is enough to suppose a mere watchmaker, or a man of eminently mechanical genius. and taste. Now, MIr. PEASE, the new member for South Durham, with much injustice to himself, as it appears to us, yet very conveniently for our purposes, avows himself just such a mecharic or mere watchmaker as we-have imagined. He is, in fact, to judgo from his speech, a man of larger and more genial apprehension, seeing, for example, in the various parties that lately divided the Legislature vital principles certain to show themselves again. He has to shorten the focus of his intellectual vision when he comea to the passage we are about to quote, as a man has to do when he looks into the works of a watch or the fabrio of a flower ; and this he does to make the matter intelligible, and divest it of mysterious or too extensive relations. Indeed, there is a sort of humility in his manner which belongs to the work, as anybody will feel a little ashamed of himself when he puts his head into a camera obsoura or screws hisa eye to a microscope. " Gentlemen," he says t"I will endeavour to turn the few remari I may make, though they may be little worth liteuing to, Into an understandable shape. Youare aware that through life Iha-a been acustomed to have to do with machinery, and th-ee fore It is not unreasonable that I should look upon State measures with somewhat of the contracted vsion of one who has had to look after his own machinery. We alway con. sider that for the purpoee of doing ita business well the machine must be adapted to that busness, and the part mnst be of proportionate strength. Now, in the great machine of the State we speak of three special departments -of the Queen or Crown, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons. We know, and we rejoice to know, that, as regards the powers and prerogative of the Crown, they are rightly guarded and amply sustained, and are sfe in the loyalty of the people. We know that as regards the House of Lordas much the same might be said, although sometimea in our iinpetuosity to go forwArd we thinkit desirable that the Lords themselves should move a little quicker. It Is not very safeto say mu ch as to the House of Commons. It may be said to be that which the people make it, so far as they have the power to make it. Bnt, gentlemen, It would be unwise for us to overlook another power which exists among us, and that is the power of the press. There is probably no press throughout the civilized world conducted with the same ability, or that is managed with the same regard to the maintenance of the contitutional rights of the people, as the press of England. But, while we rejoice in this fact, let us not shut our eyes to the possbility that even the press may go a step too far. I am willing to say, although I know it is unpopular enough to say such things,-I am wMlling to say that when I see the press beginning to make up a budget for the Chan. cellor, when I see the prs endeavour to make or unmake a Prime Minister for the Queen, when I sea the press about to make war or peace for the nation, and whenx I wee the press disposed to institute a theology for the Chrstian world, then I say it would be well for Englishmen not to rest too 'ecurely or to rely too implicitly upon everything that issues from the press. We know that every subject is amenable to the laws. The greatest nobleman who sits in the House of Lords admits the same power. The Prime Miister may be arraigned for treason, and Royalty itsef has its limits which it my not forego; but when you come to speak of the mythical 'we,' which erashes or creates by every turn of the* flywheel, I know not where you will fnd that with which to hold it in any sort of reasonable check upon those occasions when, in my humble opinion, it e. ceeds Its legitimate functions. I venture, then, to ggest that, whatever may be the defects of the House of Com. mons, however far short it may fall of its legitimate weight and power in the constitution of the country (and that weight might be much gpeter than it is without trenching in the least on any other power)-whstever tendency there may be in the press to exceed its legitimate functions, our remedy is to be found, If I understand the matter correctly, in lncreasing to the utmost possible extent the individual intelligence of our people, their individual independence of mind and action, -and through the constituted channels to bring that intelligence to bear on State affair I take it that there is no such thing as reform in the House of Commons whith can do any effectuAl god, unless there be a people who can appreciate that reform; and if in a mall way or in a large way ny of us would attempt to be reformers in one day I apprehend we shal have to begin, as It were, at tLe root of the matter, to endeasvour to strengthen every element of soDety, and to induoe every portion of the community to take its right place and act out fuu well and determinedly its own part." There is very much to admire in this passage, otherwise we should not quote it at such length; and the most admirable part of it is the apology offered by Mr. P.sz for taking a mechanical view of the British Constitution and of the Press. In the various parts of the former he finds either an enforced and now habitual modesty, or a complete responsibility, showing itself in a strict periodical account. The House of Commons, for example, has just been called to account, and to a certain extent has paid the penalty of faction. But while Mr. PosE is " contracting his vision," knitting his browNs, and putting himself into his most inquisitive mood to master the whole " machine' of British society, he finds himself puzzled by the Press. It will not fit into his system. It joints into no socket; it cogs into no wheel; it revolves round no axis; it has no formal regulator; it turns on no fulcrum; it seems to have an operation and a law of its own. It is not the primnm nmobile of the machine, for the people is that. It is not the index on the dial-face, for it Is self-willed, and has aberrations. It actually seeks to impose Cabinets, and Budgets, and theologies, and all sorts of opinions on the people, in a way in which no other power does, not even Crown, Lords, and Commons; not even the people itelf in any known form of that body. The " We" of the Pres has to Mr. Prasp the force of a myth, fabulous and mysterious, but not the less formidable. Without any fears as to the rest of the machine, he thinks it necessary to warn the people against this unaccountable, uncontrollable power. He has no actual crime to charge upon it. He finds no fault with the Budgets, the Ministers, the theologies, which the Press has imposod on the people; but, M a man will stand a great deal of shaling and yet be frightened if the earth move as much as the flicker of a candle, and as he likes to travel by rail 60 miles an hour, but does not like to be run away with by a horse at a quarter that speed, so Mr. PnAsE does not like a Prees without a regulator and a time-table, conducted by persons invisible, which never goes out, and, in a word, is not a machine, or a part of one. What reply, then, shall we make to Mr. PlSE! Shal we endeavour to remove his difficulties, to interpret the " myth," to allay his fears, and to show our safe tether, and our place in the " machine " It is not at all our place to do so. It is not even in our power to do so to a man who has fixed his visual focus on a machine close to his eyes. Indeed, we plead guilty to some of his charges. On all essential and serious points " we," at least, have held the same opinions for a long time, without either the penalty of abdication, dissolution, or even loss of circulation. To say the truth, we have the opinions, and 'we choose to maintain them at aU risks. It is also true that we have had our Ministers and our Budgets, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has, or has not, had the sagacity or the courage to adopt. We have also our theology, which is that of the Church of England, which we- maintain, as gentlemen usually do maintain a religion to which their reason and their feelings engage them. The terror which we may inspire, and which Mr. PzAsn seems to think a dangerous, because irresponsible elemenat, falls at least within known limits, as people can generally guess pretty well what will draw on them our criticisms. Should we ever addict ourselves to a faction, a prejudice, a monopoly, a conspiracy, or anything inimical to the common weal, we have warnings enough round our path to tell us where we shall soon find ourselves. But Mr. PrAsF, has no fears on that point. What makes us formidable in his eyes is, that we have such a prescription of agreement with public opinion and the public good without either being called to book or losing independence. He cannot see our connexion with the machine, even though we go with it. We must leave him in possession of his nystery. The fact we admit. We can only advise him as a man would the sentient and reawoning watec of our hypothesis. Let him enlarge his visiop instd of deliberately contracting it, let him admit sound feelings and high principles,- in fact a conscience, in the daily advisers of the British public; let him believe that there are men who would rather do goad than be known; let him infer that counsels cannot be bad which have, in the main, been adopted by this great empire; and, more than all, let him admit that PRovmzxcE, so often pompousy invoked in Parliaments and Council Chambers, is not beyond hearing of parlours and studies, and Mr. PBAs will be in the way of solving his own enigma better than we can do it for him. But this much we can tell him-we are not part of a mawhine.
The King of PBIussA has driven a hard bargain-a very hard bargain-with the Swiss in tho Neuchltel affair. We confess, certainly not with shame, that we had completely gone astray upon the matter. Four or five months back we had not the intelligence to discern that this was a mere question of £. s. d.; that the Prussian SovERzIOG was not in reality solicitous about the honour of his double-eagle and his ancestral blazonry, but that his real object was to drive a sharp bargain, in the most pecuniary sense which can be attached to that phrase, with' tho Swiss Confederation. How often do ilar cases occur ia real life I We suppose that our friend Captain O'RAFparTy is standing upon the point of honour, when in reality the divine wrath of that gallant individual is only to be assuaged by balm of a far morm prouac description than any which. is usually applied to sentimental sores ! The Conferences which have been recently held at Paris on the Swisx affair have been for all the world like a mock auction, in which the Envoy of the King of Paussi. acted the part of auctioneer. "What shall we say for NeuchAtel ! Beautiful "Swiss Canton, near the lake of that name; "picturesque castle; healthy situation; swarmiig "with tourita in the summer season. Shall we say "100,0001.? No bid? Gentlemen, consider the "clocks. Let me say 70,0001.-50,0001. The "feelings of the vendor and the honour of the "H[ouse of BRAwDzxBuRo ought not to be lost "sight of altogether. I am not only disposing "of a flourishing Canton, but of the credit of a "most respectable Monarchy. Say 45,0001. "Why, gentlemen, really this is a mere trifle " -40,0001. No bid? Lower than thatligureI "cannot go; at that price I am instructed to " buy the lot in. The chivalrous feelings of the "vendor will not -allow him to accept a lower "price." This is really no exaggeration of the course of the negotiations which have been going on in Paris for the last few weeks. Dr. KEN has been sent back to Switzerland with an nUimatum for 40,0001. Below that point the Royal chapman positively refuses to deal. Some trifling additions are attached, such as that the King of PnRussi is to retain the name of " Prince of NLvcnErru"-he might as well bargain for the title of "Prince of Anysssnrue-and a guarantee for the proper administration of the charitable institutions of NeuchateL This last condition is a matter of course,-the former one too ridiculous to deserve even pasing discussion. The real point is as to the 40,000L It was for this that at the conclusion of the last, and at the beginning of the present year, all Europe was set in commotion, and the world, scarcely recovered from the throes of the Russian war, was startled with the announcement of another and, it might be, a more terrible struggle. The dead were removed, the sand was scattered on the arena, the trunipets sounded a fresh alarm, and a fresh pair of gladiators stepped into the arena. Prusia and Switzerland had taken no share in the battle of the nations, but now they were to exhibit their untried prowess on a field apart. The greatest apprehensons, however, were entertained that this contest could not go on farr without attracting into its area other champions and more powerful interest-o strong are the sympathies of policy and war. Alas ! we were all mistaken-Sovereigns, Cabinets, staesmen, writers, and politicians,-here was no question of a European war, but of 40,0001. We are sometimes inclined to think that, after all, the King of PaussiA is one of the cleverest men in Europe. From his retirement at Potedam he contemplates with a genial smile the jar of human passions and the play of human interests. The European drama is to him not a performance in which he himself is called upon to take a share, but an exciting exhibition, of which he is to be a mero spectator, with the privilege of turning an honest penny as he beat can. When the world is in King CCArnysEs' vein he will applaud the expression of chivalrous emotion;-he will lead a stately measure round his 1itUer-Saa& with an enormous wax candle in his hand, and then go, not to war, but to bed. He will review his troops, and almost weep over them, and then dismiss them to their barracks. He will listen with the most profound emotion to choral strains of so extremely exciting a character that they would almost inspire an oyster with the emotions of a dragoon; but nothing comes of it. When all is said aud done, you will find the Prussian BAYARD at a later period of the evening disputing with his own particular set over some theological or metaphysical inanity; or, as we now find, working out in his head some little sum in which his own private interests are more immediately concerned. This was just the result, we will not say that it was altogether the motive, of the Prussian policy throughout the Russian war. While England and France were pouring out the blood of their bravest children and expending the resources of their treasuries,-while Austria had assumed an attitude which has dramwn upon her the permanent hostility of her powerful neighbour, and even the little kingdom of Sardinia sent forth a gallant band to do battle in the cause of European freedom,-it would be hard to say what the Prussians were about, save making their profits out of the general calamities of mankind. While other nations were fighting and suffering they were buying and selling; while French and English, and Sardinians and Turks, on the one side, and Russians on the other, were soldiers, the Prussians were but carriers and chapmen. They refused to take any share in the common exertions and common glory. These things passed away, and a time of profound peace succeeded. It has just been broken by a fixed resolution on the part of the Prussian SovERExGrN to put the armed forces of the monarchy in motion to obtain payment of 40,0001. for the goodwill and fixtures of the Canton of Neuchhtel. It would be idle to recur to the old protestations about the dignity of the Prussian CRown, and the implied promises that, if once the point of honour were saved by the unconditional release of the prisoners, the King of PRUssrA would pass lightly over all other *onsiderations. The prisoners were released, and we see the result. The question, after all, was merely one of thalers and ready money. There is no plaister for outraged honour like a bank-note. The condition, as far as the Swiss are eoncerned, is undoubtedly a hard one; still, we trust that, as a shrewd and discreet people, they wi have the zenEso to smile at the extortion, and to submit to it, for the sake of peace. There is scareely a privs.te individual, in this country at least, who iB mot obliged twice or thrice inhis pasage through life to submit to some extravagant charge, or to pay some bill twice over, rather than incur the discomfort and perils of litigation. A olaim of "this descriptioh may, no doubt, 'be occasionally resited with succes, but the cost of the *uo. cemful retnce will far outweigh the evils of resignation. A xum of 40,0001. is, after all, no great amount of bla¢kmail when the charge is distributed over a numerous and thriving population. We doubt not that the charge incurred since this outbreak began, or even the cost of calling the forces of the Confederation together in the course of the last few months, has far exceeded the pice named by the Prussian agent for the stock, fixtures, and goodwill of the Canton of Neuch&tel on the psrt of his principal. Better pay the sum once for al, and have done with a litigious, troublesome claimant, from whom nothing ix to be expected but annoyance and strife. The transaction is one which will reflect no great glory on the Thifian CRoWN in the pages of history. Had the Prussian KrNG chosen to act in his capacity of a private person, and dispose of a property in a foreign country to which ho might have a title mnore or less satisfactory, there would not have been a word to say. The King of PRussr has a good s right as PAM or Pxxan to receive the value of any farm or farming stock he may be inclined to sell. In the present case, however, he has ca,lled into action the forces of the Prusian Monarchy in a cause with which the Prusian people were not at all concernedL He hI called upon the Cabinets of. Europe to arbitrate upon his private rights. The best thing under the circumstances is to pay him the 40,000. which he does not disdain to claim, and to leave the Royal TRArBois of Potsdam to the judgment of Europe.

An organ had been introduced into St. George's church, Liverpool, and lat year the Synod, at ita meeting in thAt town, decided by a =rge maority that such instrumental music ws not approved by the Church; but the obnoxious instrument being il used in the worship of the oongregtion the queation was agin brought up for considertion. A long dmscussion arose on the sabjeet, The Preabyter of lane.a Ahire, it appears, bad allowed the introduction of the organ, and ad accepted a charb at Warrlngton wbhe a similar instrument was employed, and the minister of St. George stated that only 40 of hi congregation had opposed its introduction, wherea 480 adults had signed a paper in favour of the organ being continued, and a disuption was threatened if it was removed. The Rev. W. Chalmers proposed the following resolution:" Difmiss the referenoe; find that the use of instrumental music in public worship, though not without proedent, is not in accordance with the ordinary practice of this Church, and ought not to be introduced in any ca without the permision craved and obtained of the Supreme Court; and enjoin Presbyterians to take order accordingly. But with regard to the canse of St. John's, Warringon, and St. Geor&e's, Liverpool, inasmuch as instumntda music had been introduced into them by the sanction, expres or implied, of the Prefbytery of Lancashire, and is agreeable to the feelings and wishes of sid conregation, whle its probibition would disturb their peace, destroy their pro rity, and endanger their very existence, th Synod inst the Presbytery of Lancdire to take no frther ation In regard to them, and renewitw injunctions to all Presbyteries to take steps, as far as practicable, to encourage and cultivate the harmonious exercis of vocal praise," wbich was seconded by the Rev. Mr. Anderson,of Morpeth. The Rev Mr. Duncan, of Newcastle, pro. posed an amendment :-" The Synod having heard the statement of the reference nd ot the reativ disents, agree to maintain the declarative deliverance egarding the use of Instrumental music in publio worship, as haing respect to all the cone'regations wnthin its bounds. dismiss thddisente and complints, and enjoin the Preahyery to take order that instruments shall forthwith cese in St. George's, Liverpool, and St. John's, Warrington." And upon this amendment the Clerk proposed the following:-" Sustain the reference; ftnd that the Session of St. George ought to have received the Presbytery's committee appointed to confer with them, and to have deferred to the Presbytery's b rotherly desire to reson and remonstrat with them on the use of an organ in public worship, and that they are snswetable for having failed so to do ;-Iind that an organ was used in St John's, Warrington, at the time when it was received into this Church, and that an organ was introduced into St. George's, Liverpool, in 1853, with the consent and sanction of the Presbytery of Lance. shire; and the Synod declare that such use is not approved by this Church. Bnt, in consideration of the peculiarities and speilties of these case which render them exoeptional and incapable of being hereafter precedents, authorize the Presbytery o' Lancashire to forbear farther proceeding in hoc statn for silencing the instruments now in use m their oonreations; desire the Presbytery anid all other 1'resbyteries of this Church carefully to obtemper the funds of last Synod on theintroduction of instruments in the public orship of God, and further to take notioe that on no pretence such instruments be elsewhere sanctioned in the public worship of God ;"-which was soonded by Colonel Anderson. On going to a vote, the clerk's amendment was carried by 67 votes against 3S over r. DuDncans amendmene, and by 53 votes against 49 over the original motion, r.

-HA GREAr ATLANTrC SUBMARIE TZELX- GRAPH OABLE. TO THIE EDrTOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-I have just read in your paper of this morning a letter from the engineer of the Atlantic Telegraph Com. pany relative to the article in your impression of the 22d inst. I have seen a specimen of this "cable," and a beautiful Uttle rope it is; but leaving the question of the efficiency of the copper-conducting wire to those "experienced in telegraph matters," I may be permitted, perhaps, to join the writer of your article in expressing great doubt of the strength and durability of the rope. The "ga.uge" of the iron wire forming the strands of rope is so extremely fine that It is hard to believe (as we have been told) that before oxidation proceeds to any in. jurious extent the iron will be protected by a cssing of minute aheUfish or partides of shell and sand 1 have a specimen of the Mediterranean cable, and in that the thickness of the wire is so groat that one can wee there may be time for this coating of slxeU or sand to form before the oxidation of the metl is comparatively serious. The Atlantic cable is much smaUer, much lighter, much znore pliant, and thus much more manageable than the other, and so many experienced men are engaged about it, and so confident of Suoems that it would have seemed to me somewhat presumptuous to have advanced my opinion or doubts but for yonr interesting article and Mr Bright's rather incomplete reply to iL J Am. Sir. Your obedient aarvant J. I P. April 24. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-I am induood to intrude on your space with a few remarks relating to the article in your paper of yesterday's date on the Atlantic telegraph cable, inasmuch as some of your inferenoes are contrary to fact. You say that if by any means the oentral conducting wire should become attenuated its conducting power throughout its whole length would be lowered in the same ratio. Such would not be the ca"e, as it is well known to any one oonversnt with the laws regulating the transmistion of electnic currenta through long conductor, that the interposition of several yards of a wire as small as the 1-50th of an inch in a conductor of 1-16 wire of saoe miles in extent wiil mns}e so little diflerence that it cannot be detected by the most delicate instrument. It is only on increasing the smaller conductor to 100 or more yards that it becomes appreciable. I have no wish to detract from the merit of Mr. Alltnes invtutionin aubnmaineropes, but in my opinitn (and I ?-ave had some experienoe in telegraph matters), his plant wil not be found practicable. The caing of the ordmury subnmarne wires with iron is not onlyto *vo late strength, bat also to protect the coreof guttaperohs, or other insulatiug material, from abrasion in inying down or from the action of the waves on th ro, &o, and should a cable be constructed in the way you recommend it bil1 De almost impossible to submerge it without som mi cry to the coMparatively s#ft insulating coveri gh The lapping of th coil round the break-drumn would be suficient to ca th iron core to cut through the indiarubber, or whatever might be employed, and should such be the as the misdh}ef would be tmuch greater than if a part of the ordinay small eon. ductor should be expoeed I hAve Dot the ighZ intert ini the Atlantic Telepa& Conupeny, nor have I any tnotive for preferring the plaZ adopted by them, bat I know that befor*4e S lho this particular form everg pc3il sen0t-ie with a viewr of arriving at tno bestarragmeut, tand 14*.- lieva they leavedoneso. -_ T ant A: , A, WTI. fiT.kV nlwnilissalnw,? - 46, St# lolms tmt-road, April e
AMERICA. (BY ELEc=RIC TELEGRAPH.) hlVERPOOL, A?R 25. The Cunard screw atamship Alps has arrived, Vrith advices from New York to the 11th inst. She brings no specie. The screw steamship Glasgow vwas going mto New York as the Alps left. On the 17th inst. the Alps passed a large steamer, supposed to be the America, hence for Boston; on the 19th exchanged signals with a large American 4ateamer. The screw steamship City of Washington, hence, -nd the United States mail steamship Washington, from Hamburg and Southampton, had arrived at .New York. The Royal mail steamship Niagara, hence, had 3rrived at Halifax, and the screw steamship Canadia, hence, had arrived at Portland. The Washington correspondent of the New York Eerald says - "I learn today from good authority that thepresent AAministration does not entirely agree with the preceding -one in their views respecting the proposed chAnge in naval warfare. Ia additiorn to the abolition of the right to cap. turo merchant ships by public armed vesels as well as by privateers, as laid down in Secretary Marcy's letter upon Prlvateering, it is supposed that our Government will insist upon the abolition of blockades; for, if England has the sight to blockade all our ports and capture our vessels that escape, there can be no free trade in time of war. I learn also that letters bave been written to our Ministers abroad to suspend further action on this matter until they receive Other instructions." The same correspondent says that the China Mission had been offered to Mr. Reed, of Pennsylvania. The New York Courier and Einquirer 3ates that he had accepted the appointment, and *ys that for 20 years he has been the leading comruercisL lawyer in Philadelphia. The same joural Ba9ys:- I " The Administration has expressed sympathy with British policy in China to this extent :-It approves of the -effort to open direct diplomatic communication with Peldn, the capital, and to arm consuls ot other representatives with the power of protecting citizens of their own nationalities. Further it will not go, and there will be no alliance with England and France for offensive purposes." The Government had appointed a Minister-Extraordinary to Canton. A steam frigate had been ordered to reinforce the American fleet in the Chinese waters. Two other ships of war were ordered to be prepared for the Indian station. The Washington correspondent of the New York Hlerald states that the Secretary of State had completed arrangements with the Danish Minister for the abolition of the Sound Dues, the United States paying $380,000. He also says:- "The statement that Lord Napier bad been informed by - oar Government that the interference of British officers in the affairs of Central America had virtually abrogated the CUlayton-Buiwer treaty is totally devoid of foundation." The steam frigate Niagara was to have proceeded to sea for a trial tr;p on the lOth, but owing to an -Accident to one of her cylinders she would be delayed about ten days longer. Advices from Bermuda state that Admiral Fanshawe had embarked in Her Majesty's ship Bos-eawen for England. The NeW York Stock-market on the evening of the 10th, with unusually large sales, took an upward turn, and exhibited more firmness. The transactions in Erie shares were large, closing at 521; Virginia Six per Centa., 91 to 911; Miasouri, 83i to 849=; Kentucky Six per Cents., 102; Ohio ditto, 104i ; Indiana Five per Cents., 83; Pennsylvanian Five per Cents., 84; Virginia Six per Cents., 91; New York Centrpl, 87k; Haslesm, 11; Reading, 79; Hudson Iliver, 24 ; Michigan Central, 94*; Illinois Central, 130i. The iaoney-market was a little calmer, with less business paper offering, but there was no quotable relaxation in the rates of interest. Foreign ex-change Was not active, but rates were well supplied. 33Bills on London sold slowly at 108i to 109. Cotton was quiet and firm. The common brands of breadatuffs were dull, aund tho better grades in good trade demand at steady prices. Corn was steady, with a good business. Scotch pig iron wan hardly so firm. Bar iron was in fair deniand. There was an improved demand for tobacco. Freights nominal. At New Orleans, on the 10th, the receipt of the ?fiagara's news had no effect upon cotton. The telegraphic advicee assert that the receipts up to that time, as compared with those of last year, fell short by 131,000 bales, and that the receitse at all the southern ports were less by 363,000 bales. SHIPPIlNG INTELLIGENCE. The Orient and the Guy Mannering, hence; the Christiana, from London; and the Josephine, from 3lavre, had arrived at New York.

Nxv WThTBR GAnDENw AT OHELsFA.-A magnificent winter garden has been opened by Messrs. Weeks and Co., hortioultural architects, &c., upon their grounds, Ring's-road, Chelsea, which, in respect of the rarity and beauty of its contents, and the great ability with which it Is managed, exceeds anythin of the kind yet attempted in this country. The estab 'iament fronts the King's-road, with a large conservatory in the centre, on each side of 'hich are seed-rooms and show-rooms, evincing great taste and filled with standard bays, orange trees, myrtles. . fine spciiaens of fsncy geraniums, and standard azalea Indica, the rafters being covered with the best -quality of Newr Hollan d cimbers. A variety of elegant hsnigtng baskets and vases of terra-cotta, glass and Wood also contribute to the ornamentation -of the showroomis. Passing through the conservatory, we reach tho beautiful winter garden, which is an elegant construction of wood and glassi seen times as large as a cr- arnon-sized lothouse.

THE LU O? CHAZLOTTB BRONTM* There aro many reasons why this life should be read with avidity, and, as we learn from the general testimony, should absorb and fascinate those who read it. On the one hand it diwclowes the peculiarities of a race rude and strenuous as the wind which blows over their bleak moorlands, and on the otherhand it shows how agifted woman may be tempered under such stringent influences to the duties of her lot,the trials of her life, and the exigencies of her genius. It is rarely that we find a portrait of literary character with such a remarkable setting, and as rare to find an author whose works are so popular, so vivid and distinctive, and whose personal history was so utterly unknown. That eager curiosity to know the personal characteristics of those with whose creations we are familiar, and which is one of the directest tributes to genius, is here gratified fully and at a bound. A sister authoress, gifted herself with superior powers, has described with true womanlv sympathy and eagerness the whole course of the life which is now closed for ever, and we receive therecord so honourablo to both without searching for its imperfections; contented, and more than contented, to regard it as a monument of courage and endurance, of suffering and triumph, wfhich is not only a glory to the literary brotherhood, but a creditable testimony to the tendencies of human nature. All the secrets of the literary worlkmanship of the authoress of Jane Rvre and many of the sources from which she drow her conceptions of character, with the other materials submitted to her searching analysis, are unfolded in the course of this extraordinary narrative. We shall therefore let the biographer, as nearly as possible, tell her story in her own manner, and disclose these circumstances as they arose in succesaion. The father of Miss Bronte was the perpetual curate of Haworth, a village about four miles from Keighley, in Yorkshire, the latter being one of the seats of the woollen trade, of which Bradford is the emporium. Hawrorth "is situated onthe side of a steep hill, with a background of dun and purple moors risin and sweeping awva yet higher thas the chfrch, which is built at the very summit of the long narrow street. All round the horizon there is the same line of sinuous, wavelike bills, the scoops into which they fall only revealing other hills beyond, of similar colour and shape, crowned with wild, bleak moors -grand from the ideas of solitude and loneliness which they suggest, or oppres3ive from the feeing which they give of being pent up by some monotonose and illimitable barrier, according to the mood in which the spectator may be.", Thus, amid the scenery of Shirley, and among a race as roulgh as any who are depicted there or in Wuihering Reights, Charlotte, four sisters, and one brother struggled up without a mother's care, and with scarcely a friend, in a desolate-looking house, surrounded on three sides by rain-discoloured tomb-stones and open to all the winds of heaven, which were peculiarly trying to their slender frames and frail constitutions They lost their mother early, and their father, it is said, was not naturally fond of children; moreover, he had views of Spartan eccentricity as to their nurtuire. They were not allowed "flesh meat" or superfluities in dress, and their father, though not intending unkindness, would sometimes explode in paroxysms of passion, and would relieve himself by fring his pistols off at the back door, by sawring awa3y at the backs of his chairs, and once by stuffing his hearthrug on the fire, and half suffocating himseT f with the stench till it was wholly consumed. The children, althoughthey had nothing but potatoes for therr dinner, never seemed to wish for anything else; and one of the servants reports that you would not have known there wasachildinthe house, "they were such still, noiseless, good little creatures." Maria, the eldest, would shut herself up (Maria, but seven !) in the children's study with a newspaper, and be able to tell one everything when she came out. She was as good as a mother to her sisters and brotber. Thus the little things clung quietly together, for their father was busy in his study and in his parish, or with their mother, who was at this time in her last illnes, and they took their meals alone, sat reading or whispering low in the " children's study," or wandered out 6n the hillside hand in hand. Mr. Gaskeli suspects that they had no children's books, and perhaps we may add no playthings, except animals and flowers. The absence of children's usual resources, quite as much as premature fondness for books, was probably the cause of their precocious development ; but it is at all events clear, from various testimonies, that they were not like other children from a very early age. Their father says:- " When more children, as soon as they could read and write, Charlotte and her brothers and sisters used to invent and act little plays of their own, in which the Duke of Wellington, my dsughtor Charlotte's hero, was sure to come off conqueror; when a dispute would not unfrequently arise among them regarding the comparative merits of him, Bonaparte, Hlannibal, and Cae*ar. When the argument got warm, and rose to its height, as their mother was then dead, I had sometimes to come in ag arbitrator, and settle the disputo to the best of my judgment. Gene. raUy, in the management of these concerns I freqnentle thought that I discovored signs of rising talent, which I hA seldom or never before seen in any of their aze. . . A circumstance now occurs to my mind which I ma;&s well mention. When my children were very young-when, as as far as I can remember, the oldest wvas about ten years of age, and the youngest about four, thinking that they knew more than I had yet discovered, in order to make them speak with lees timidity, I deemed that if they were put under a sort of cover I might gain my end, and happenma to have a mask in the house, I told them all to stand and speak boldly from under cover of the mak. " I began with the youngest (Anne, afterwrards Acton Bell), and asked her what a child like her most wanted - she answered, I Age and experience.' I asked the nexd (Emily, afterwards EUlis Bell) what I had best do with her brother Branwell, who was sometimes a naughty boy. She answered, 'Reason with him, and when he won't Plsten to reason whip him.' I asked Branwell what was the best way of knowing the difference between rheintellects of men and women. He answered, 'By considering the difference between thom asto their bodies.' I then asked Charlot+e what was the beat book in the world. She answered, 'The Bible.' And what was the next best. She answered, 'The Book of Nature.' Ithen asked the next what was the best mode of education for a woman. She answered, 'That which would make her rule her house welL' Lastly, I asked the oldest what was the best mode of spending time. She answererd, ' By laying it out in preparation for a happy eternity.' I may not have given precisely their wrords, but I have nearly done so, as they made a deep and lasting improsslen on my msemory. The substace, howrever, was exactly what I have stated." About a year after Mrs. Bronte's death one of her elder sisters came from Penzance to superintend these little desolate philosophers. Maria and Elizabeth, the eldest two, and subsequently Charlotte herself, were then sent to that school at Cowan'sbridge of which Charlotte has described her bitter exmerienoes in Jane Eyre. In that pictare of childr's suffering from harsh or inadequate superintendence and from careless and filthy cookery (we suppress our indignation at a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm), the Helen Burns of the novel is an exact transcript of Maria Bronte. Miss Temple and Miss Scatcherd also had their originals at Cowan's-bridge, and though the fever which broke out there spared the little Bront6s, yet Maria aud Elizabeth went home successively to die of the consumptive tendencies which, doubtless, their abominable diet had accelerated. It is a singular instance of the Nemesis which attends on vile cooks and careless housekeepers that, to use Mrs. Gaskell's words, "the pictures, ideas, and conceptions of character received into the niind of the child of eight years old were destined to be reproduced in fiery words a quarter of a century afterwards." Charlotte herself the little brooding authoress, was removed from this fatal nursery in the autumn of the following year on the ground of ill-health, and at the age of little more than nine she was suddenly called into the responsibilities of eldest sister in a motherless family. The four children who survived, including Charlotts, were now associated in their plays and amusements, which were mostly of a sedentary and intellectual nature. As a result of their mutual stimulation in their retired home, Mrs. Gaskell has had a curious packet confided to her, containing an immense amount of nmDuSCript in an inconceivably small space ;-tales dramas, poems, romances, written principally by Charlotte, in a hand which it is almost impossible to decipher without the aid of a magnifying glass. We are favoured with a facsimile of a page of this MES. and with a list of these w orks, making in the whole 22 volumee, each volume containing from 60 to 100 of these minutely written pages. Such was the fertility of the precocious little brains that produced them that these 22 volumes were a11 written in about 15 months, and from some extracts which Mrs. Gaskell prints we may infer that they were full of interest and considerable promise. The * The ,L'f nof CfaHotle .Broxe, .author of Jalen Byr4 ShiPey, Wette, &-. By E. C. GaskelX. author of Jary Barton, Ruth, ko, Swith &ud Eldem, 1857. predominance of the imaginative faculty'is strong marked, which Mrs. Gakell reasonabyttributes to the monotony of the snall authors' existence and the absence of real. occurreces in their isolated village. Children, she says, leading a secluded life are often thoughtful and dreamy; the impresions made upon them by the world without, the unusual sighta of earth and sky, the accidental meetings with stranue faees and agures (rare occurrences in those out-of-tbe-way places), ara sometimes maui:fied by them into things so deeply aignificant as to be almost supernatu-raL A few such suggestive incidents are at the aame time particularizel, together with direct evidence of what the authoress could make of them by her own original or assirilative powver. What Miss BrontS became in outward appearance under these influences, as she grew up into girlhood, is described in clear portraiture - " In 1831 sho was a q,uiet, thoughtful girl, of nearly 15 years of age, very small m figu- stunted' was the word she appliedtoherself-but, as herlijbeandheadwereinjust proportion to the slight, fragile body, no word in ever so slig t a degree suggestive of deformity could properly be apphed to her i with soft, thick, browa hair, and peculiar eyes, of which i find it difclt to give a description, as they appeared to me inher later life. They were large and well shaped; their coloura reddish brown; but if the iris was closely examined, it appeared to be composed of a gret variety of tints. The nsnal expression was of 9niet, lstening intelligence; but now and then, on some Just occasion for vivid intere4t or wholesome indignation, a liht would shie out, as if some spiritual lamp had been kindled which glowed behind those expressive orbs. I never saw the like in any other human creature. An for the rest of her feature; they were plain, large, and Ri set; but, unless you began to catalogue them, you were hardly aware of tho fact, for the eyes and power of the countenanco overbalanced every physical defect; the crocked mouth and the large nose were forgotten, ana the wshole fb arrested te attention, and presently attracted all those whom she herself would have cared to attract. Her hands and feet were the smallest I ever saw. Ws-hen one of t4e former was placed in mine it was lke the soft tonch of a bird in the middle of my palm. The delieate long fingers had a peculiar fineness of sensation, -which was one reason why all her handiwork, of whateverkind-writing, sewing, bcit. ting-wae so clear in Its minuteness She was remarkably neat in her whole personal attire; but she was dainty as to the fit of her shoes and gloves. I I can well imaeine that the grave, serious compo6ure which, when I knew her, gpve her face the dignity of an old Veneffn portrait was no acquisition of later years, but dated from that early age when she found herself in the positien of an elder sister to motherless chiliren. But in a girl bnly just entered on her teens such an expresion would be called (to use a country phrsze) 'old fashioned;' and in 1831, the period of which I now write, we must think of her ass a little, set, antiquated girl, very quiet In manners and very quaint in dress; for, besides the influence exerted by her father's ideas concerning the simphiity of attire befitting the wife and daughters of a country clergyman (as evinced in his destruction of the coloured boots and the sulk gown). her aunt, on whom the duty of dressng her nieceg principally devolved, had never been in society since she left Penzance eight or nine years before, and the Penzanca fashions of that day were sl dear to her heart.' In January, 3831, Charlotte was again sent to school to a Miss Wooler's, near Kirklees, a neighbourhood abounding with wild traditions and historic memories. Ghastly legends were associated with places in the neighbourhood, and a rustling ghost occupied the third story of even the young ladies!' establishment." Charlotte is described as an odd-looking, oddly-dressed little girl, who had great difficulty in reconciling herself to her absence from home. Her ignorauce of some of the first elements of education was strangely contrasted with the variety of her reading. " She would confound us," says a fellow-pupil, who is evidently a person of considerable inteligence, "by knowing things that were out of our range altogether." A few sentences further on a charActeristic is mentioned which creates a painful impression as of a natture half developed. " In our playhours she sat or stood still, with a book if posible. Some of us once urged her to be on our side in a game at ball, She said she had ?ever played, and could not play." Nevertheless she was liked, and she contrived to interest her associates in the day-dreams of herself or sisters. "The habit of 'malkig out' interests for themselves that most children get who have none in actual life was very strong in her. The whole family used to 'make out' histories and invent characters and events. I told her sometimes they were like growing potatoes in a cellar. She said sadly, ' Yes, I know we are "' It appears that she made an effort to share in the sports of her companons, but was too awkward and shortsighted to do so successfully. Her own talents were exhibited best after dark, for she was an invaluable storyteller, and frightened the rest of the girls almost out of their wits as they lay In their beds, On one occasion she was so effective that one of her audience was seized with violent palpitations, and brought Miss Wooler to the resue by the loud screams which she was unable to repress. Miss Wooler herself was a sensible person, and had witnessed some remarkable scenes, which she had a talent for describing. Among others, the notable stand made in the neighbourhood against the Luddite insurgents by a Mx. Cartwrlghtwas thus obtained for the fature purposes of Shirley. Stories of the weavers and of the squirearchy, of the feuds of Churchmen and Dissenters, of coarse riots and revels in the churches themselves, according with the traditions of Charlotte's own home, were here also imparted to her from Miss Wooler's recollections. Here she made the friendships which endured through life with two of her school companions, and to which we owe much of the sabsequent correspondence illuatrative of her internlw history. After a stay of two year, she left Mliss Wooler's in 1832, and returned to Haworth. Here Charlotte and her brotber Branwell for a time entertained the notion of eventually getting their living as artists, with which object they took lessons in drawing and sketehed assiduously. But nothing came of this project, for her brother fell into looso courses, became a tutor in a private family, was seduced and afterwards sa¢rificed by its mistress, for whom he cherished an ardent though guilty affection, and ultimately shortened his life by the I means which he took to deaden his remorse or forget his disappointment. The continual presence of that brother, with his deacending courses, constitutes one of the darker shadows in a life which had otherwise little enough of sunabine. Charlotte herself had to lay aside her artist project and become a teacher at Miss Wooler's, whither her sster Emily accompanied her as a pupil, though a girl still more sensitive and fragile than herself. The suffering to which the latter was exposedby the loss of the bleak solitude, which to her comprised home and hiberty, was, however, too much for her, and she returned home after an experiment of three months. But Charlotte remained longer, and, until her health also failed, was tolerably happy, if such a term may be permitted to a mixture of asceticism, debility and resignation. Then she became nervous, and haM tremors such as those described in Jane Eyre, which grew almost into visions in their painfulintensity. At this time she learnt the history of a real occurrnce which afterwards suggested the conception of Rochester's domestic incubus. On her return home we find her and her sisters bent upon composition, as yet not quite conscious of their powers, and chafing in the impatience of their irritable natures. The picture thus revealed of these little restles figures ranging to and fro like caged lynxes is hardly pleasing, and yet it was one of the dearest recollections to which Charlotte could revert in her after life- "It ws the household custom among these girls to sew till 9 o'clock at night. At that hour Mis Branwell generally went to bed, and her nieces' duties for the day were accounted done. T'hey put awa% their worl and began to pace the room backwards and orwar4s up and down-as often with the candles extinguished, for economy's sake, as not-their figures glancing into the fire-light, and out into the shadow, perpetually. At this time they talked over past cares and troubles; they planned for the future, and consulted each other as to their plana. In after years this was the time for discussingtogether theplote of theirnovelga And again, still later, this was the time for the lat surviving sister to walk alone, from old accustomed habit, round and round the desolate room, thinking adly upon the ' days that were no more.' But this Chrlitmas of 1836 was not without its hopes and darinqt aspirations. They had tried their hands at story' writing in their miniature magazine long ago. They all of them ' made out' perpetually. They had likewise attempted to write poetry, and had a modest confidence that they had achieved a tolerable success. But they mnew that they mnight decelvo themselves, and that sisters' judgment of each others productions were likely to be too partial to be depended apon. go Charlotte, as the eldest, resolved to writs to Sonthey. I believe (from an expression in a letter to be notioed hereafter) that she also consulted Coleridge; but I have not met with any part of that correspondene." Southey was from home, and did not answer till some time afterwards, Branwell simultaneously wrote to Wordsworth a letter wbich gi-.es a very high impression of his abilitie , and doubtles obtained a considerate reply. Southey also replied to Charlotte after some months, to th effect that " iterature cannot be the busineie, oi a woman's life, and it, ouTght not to be." Oterise Id letter was kind and sypathetic; "a litte xtrlngent4" sad tlt recipient, "but t. M dU me geod." She was now alim repin g hli healdth e. .axQtiX2 Her prooqed,W;: at'jWbj tie aet very clearly datedordingushed,ut it appears that she had one or t 0& offert of mariago which were declined, and that she made a brief experiment of the situation of governess Under no circum4tances could she free herself entirely from her selftorture, which at this period took the form of religiou despondency. At the age of 21 even she was "smitten at timea to the heart with the conviction that ghastly Calvinistic doctrines are truedarkened," he says, "by the very shadows of Ipiritual death." The better aspects of her life were her zeal and resolution in the cerformance of womanly duties and social charities, and the strong and sincere affections which made a home of Eaworth parsonage. In the year 1840 she continued at home, and the plan of keeping a school was continually before her and her sisters DIuring the winter, however, she was composing a story which we infer to have been the Professor, a work yet, as we hear to be published. In March, 1841, she obtained her aecond and last situation as a governess, and subsequently she and her sister were placed at the pensionnat of M Hdger, at Brussels, to perfect them in a knowledge of French. The house in which they resided at the Belgian capital had formerly been the xcexie of the splendid feasts of the grand &rment des Arbaitiers but the Belgian demoiselles who had succeeded them were not much to the taste of the serious little Englishwo sn. She describes them as f singularly colds selfh, animal, and inferior ;" as "very mutinous, and difficult for the teachers to manage, and their principles as rotten to the core." Her Protditsntism was also sensitively alive to the injuriou influenees of Romajism, and she was shocked by the sensual depravity of a young Frenchwooman with' whom ane' was throwir.much into communication. The experiences of the Brussels Pensionnat are turned to account in Vuf te, but the insti'uctions of x- H6ger, a very accomplished person, were nevertheless of great advantage to Charlotte.- - She and her sister were called home by the death of her aunt, and she afterwards 'returned to Brasels alone; but towards the end of 1843 seb finally came back to Haworth. Here is an episode in her home life at this point, and which identifies her uister Emilywith 'Shirley:"- " The helplessness of an animal ws ltepappot to Chr. lotWs heart; the fierce, wild, intractability of its nature was what often recommended it to Emily. Speaking of her dead sister, the former told me that from her many traits in Shirley'a character were taken; her way of sitting on the rug reading, with her arm round her rough bulldog's neck her calling to a strange dog, running past, wit hanging head and loling tongue, to give it a meIifil draught of water, its maddened snap at her, her nobly stern presence of mind, going riht Into the kitchen, and taking up one of Tabhys red-hot itilita irons to sear the bitten place, and teling no one till the danger was wel-nigh over, for fear of the terrors that might beset their weaker mind&. Allthis, looked upon aS a well-invented fiction in Shiriy, was written down by Charlotte with streaming eyes; it was the literal true account of what Eiily had done. The same tawny bulldog (with his 'strangled whistle') called 'Tartar' in Shirley was 'Keeper' in Haworth pasonage-a gift to Emily. With the gift came a yarning. Keeper was faith. fultothe depths of his nature as iong A he was with friends; but he who struck him with a stick or whip roused tho relentless nature of the brute, who flew at his thoat forthwith, and held him there till one or the other was at the point of death. Now, Keeper's household fault was thi. He loved to s upstairs and stretch hissqre, tawny lmbs on the comfortable beds covered over with delicate white, counterpanes. But the ceanlinews oi the onage arrangements was perfect, and this babit of Keeper's swas so objectionable' that Emily, in reply to Tab V's remonstrance, declared that if he was found again trangressing she berself, in defiance of warning and his wellknown ferocity' of nature, would beit him so severely that he would never offend agin. In the gathering dusk of an autumn evening Trabby came, half triumphantly, half tremblingly, but in reat wrath, to tell Emily that Keeper was lying on the best bed in drows voluptuousness. Charlotte saw E1mly's whitening face and set mouth, but dared not speak to interfere; no one dared wheh Emily's eyes glowed in that manner out of the paleness of her face, and when herlipe were so compreesed into stone. She went up. stairs, and Tabby and Charlotte stood in the gloomy passage below full of the dark shadows of coming night. Down. stairs came Emuily, dragging after her the unwilling Keeter, his hind legs set in a heavy attitude of resistance, held by the 'scuftof his neck,' but growling low and savagely al the tne. The watchers would fain have spoken, but durt not, for fear of taking off Emily's attention, and causing her to avert her head for a moment from the enraged brte. She let him go, planted in adark corner at the bottom of the tirst No time was there to fetch stick or rod, for fear of the strangling clutch at her throat; her bare cliched fist strack Against his red fieroe eyes, before he-had time to make his spring, and in the language of thetrf,sbe ' punished hiEm' till hiseyes wereswelled up, and the halfblind, supified beast was led to his acui. tomed lair, to have his asweed head fomented and cared for byShe very Emil herself. The generous dog owed her no grudge; he IoTv her dearly evcr after; he walked first among the mourners to her funeral; he slept moaning for nights at the door of her empty room, and never, so to speak, rejoiced, dog fashion, ater her death. He, in his tun, was mourned over by the surviving sister. Let us somehow hope, in half Red Indian creed, that he follows Emily now; and 'when he rests, sleeps on some soft white bed of dreams, unpunished when he awakens to the life of the land of shadows."1 After an unsuccessful attemapt to open a school, the three sisters published, in 1846, at their own risk, a volume of poems which did not attract much attention, and which were criticized as 'the production of three brothers-" Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell." The Professor went the round of the London publishers to no purpose, but Charlotte nevertheless commenced Jane Byre, while her sisters were endeavouring respectively to publish Wutheaing ei91ghts and Agnes Grey. At this time their father was gradually growing blind; their brother had gone through his life-trial, and was tending to an early grave by hbi mierable excessea; they had to care for an aged servant whom they would not discard; their own health was delicate, but under all their disabilities they workled at their literary tasks atrenuously and unsparingly. Jane Eyre, when finished, was, however, a success, forit was at once accepted by Messrs. Smith and Elder. " When the manuscript of Jane Zi,re had been received by the future publishers of that remarkable novel, it fell to the sbare of a gentleman connected with the firm to read it first. He was so powerfully struck by the character of the tale that he reported his impression in very strong terms to Mr. Smith, who appears to have been much amused by the admiration excited. 'You seem to have been so enchanted that I do not know how to believe you,' he laughingly said. But when a second reader, in the person of a clearheaded Scotchman, not Oven to enthusiasm, had taken the MS. home in the evening, and became so deeply interested in it as to sit up half the night to finish it, Mr. Smith's curiosity was sufficiently excited to prompt him to read it for himsell; and great as were the praises which had been bestowed upon it, he foundthat they had not exceeded the truth." The power and fascination of the tale itself made its merits known to the public without much assistance from profesional criticism, and in a few weeks ".the rush ben for copies." Considerable interest, which M1rx. G(askell describes as " a ferment," was excited Fby the question,-Who 'could have written it ? But even the publishers of Jane E-jre could not have resolved that, for they were ignorant whether Currer Bell was a real oran assumed name-whether it belonged to a man or a womau. When the second edition appeared with the dedication to Mr. Thackeray, "' people looked at each other and wondered afresh," and there was an absurd rumour, which Mrs. Gaskell omits to mention, that it was written by the live original of Becky Sharp. Still the secret was preserved both at home and to the world till the dilemmas attendant on the publication of the sisters' novels, under amumed names, went on increasing. Miany critics insisted on believing that all the fictions published as by three Bells were the works of one author, but written at different periods of his development and maturity. As this suspicion affected the reception of the books, and eventually involved their publiahers in a dispute with an American house, Charlotte and Anne came up to London to assure Messrs. Smith and Elder of their separate identitv. They took up their quarters at the Chapter Coffee-house, Paternoster-row, in their helpless ignorance where else to go. " On reaching Mr. Smith's, Charlotte put his own letter into his hands;- the same letter which had excited so much disturbance at Haworth Parsonage only 24 hours before. 'Where did you get this ? said he, as if he could not believe that two young ladies dresed in black, of slight figures and diminutive statute, looking pleased, yet agitated, could be the embodied Currer and Acton Bell, for whom curiosity had been hunting so eagerly in vain. An explanation ensued, and Mr. Smith at once began to form plans for their amusement and pleasure during their stay in London." As far as their weakness and nervousness would permit they enjoyed some of the sights of London, including the opera. But their stay in town did not exceed two or three days, and they returned to .Eawortb, where the dark clouds were gathering over their doomed household. In September their brotlier Branwell died, as was even desirable. " I have heard, from one awho attended Branwell in his lat illness, that he tesolved on standing up to die. Be had repeatedly said that as long aa there was life there was strnth of will to do w'hat it chose; and wbhen the last egoieame on he insisted on assuing tb position just mentiond.

Affer him Emily; after her Anne. " The pen, alid down when there. were threo sisters livinz and loving, was taken lipwhen one alone remained.' Therork was resumed and oontinuied resignedly. "But it was dreary to write without any onie to listen to the progres of her tale, to fnd fault or to simpathize while pacing the length of the psalour in the evenings, as in the days that were no more. Three Sisters ,had done this.; then two, the other siter dropping off from the walk," but the last pernevered. At length new relations' were gradually formed, a newv interCourse xprung up with the world of critics and authors, to whom her fame introduced 'her, and she, the last of thui fated sisterhood, seems to have floated for a season in her little sesof lory,and by extending her narrow circle to have e¶nded the search of death. Her correspondence with Mesr. Lese and Williams, and that induced by her intimacy with iss Mar;tineau, Mr Gaskell, and other, make up a large portion of the rest of her painful biography. She went up to town on subsequent oecasions, and she dilatesmuchuponher interviews withThackeray, whomn she appears only half to relish and understand, but to, whom as a mightier artist she defers reverentially. She makes other excursions also to Scotland and the English Lakes, and discusses her impressions either of the scenery she vsits or of the books with which her kdnd friend Mr. Williams supplies her. But there is little nore of incident though much of character in her memoirs A dewcription of the effect of Rachel's acting will at once recall to ibs readers a passage in YQlldte. VUete itself was persevered in only at intervals. Her increasing indispoeition subdued her at last, in spite of all her efforts of reason and will. She tried to forget oppressive, recollections in writing. Her publisher. were ilmportunate for a new book from her pen. Villette waa begun, but she lacked power to continue it. Her letters show how long it lingered, and 'how in the absence of home criticisnm she despondedof its success, and craved the shelterinz shadow of an icognito. "I seem to d&ead tfe advertisements," she says-" the large lettered 'ICurrer Bell's New Novel,' or ' New Work, by the author of -Tane Byre.' These, however, I feel well enough are the transcendentAlisms of a retired wretch." Yet her apprehensions were superfluous, for ViUee was well received, with the exception of a criticism somewhat stringent from her friend Miss Martineau and which, because it was so clearly candid, naturally caused her an annoyance. By this time her reputation was out of the reach of accidents, though it subsequently hadto pas the ordeal of a train of emulous ladies who conceived a sriesof Janeyresattenuated in substance andspirit. Their exemplar, however, was destined to write no more, for she was married after some delay to a clergyman who was strongly attached to her, and whose lot it was to solace the last few months of her troubled life. These few moons, however, contribute nothing to her story. " We, her loving friends, anding outide, caught occa ional glimpses of brightness and plesnt peaceful murmurs of aound, telling of the gladne within; and we looked at each other and gently sid, Ater a. hardand long xtrWe -after Many cae and manz bitter sorrowa-she is tautinz haWpInss now 1 We thought of the alight aetringenciesof her character, and how they wenld n to full r-e Sweetnes in that cal munshine of domestic peace.

Those who sawher saw an outward change in her look, telingof inwardthings And we thought, and we ho , and we prophesed, in our grat love and reverene. But GOd's ways are not as our ways. A walk of seven or eight miles to see the effect of melted snow upon a neighbouring waterfall brought on a cold, from which she never recovered. Nausea, fever, delirium supervened,- "'Iong days and longer nights went by, atill the sme relenUtless nauesa and faintness, and still borne on in patient trus. About the third week in March there was a change; a low wandering delirium came on; and in it she begged constantly for food, andeven for stimulants. She swallowed eagerly now; bat it wa too lte. Wakening for a instant from this stupor of intelligence, abs saw her huband's woe-worn face, and caught the sound of some murmured 'Words of prayer that God would rpare her 'Oh ' she -whispered forth, I I am not going to die, am I He will notseperate us, wsrave been so happy."' She died on the 31st of March, 1855, and was followed to the grave, among others, by the outcasts of the neighbourhood, to whom she had ever been a considerate friend. That she should have so abounded in aU charities through a life of wearines and sorrow is not, however, surprising. Her intefectual manifestations are far more remarkable when we compare them with her opportunities, and still more when we contrast them with her infinite hindrances How that little sickly girl, so ignorant of the world, so stunted, and secwlded, and cramped aud environed could conceive the character of Rochester, and complete her conception, is, in short, a literary marvel. Criticism is disarmed, and we have no controversy wdth her genius, considering the conditions under which it worked. We remember only that a certain creative mind has ceased to fret itself; and without further mention of its faults, we add our sincere tribute to its fame.
Tn JEoN. NI!L Dow AT KiNcmHEsnTE -A numerons meeting of the advocates and friends of the Maine LIqaor Law mnovement was held in the Free-tradehall Manobester, on Thursday evening, to give a welcome to tne Hon. Neal Dow, of Portland, United States, when Sir W. C. Trevelyan presided. An address was presented. Mr. Dow spoke in reply for nearly two hours, observing tbatthis question of the Waine law was of moore importance to England5 to its physical power and national glory and to the prosperity and happiness of the people, than oh other qUestions put together, save their retion to the Creator. America had turned its attention to this question it was becaue its people had suffered more from intemperanoe than any other, excepting those of Old England. America owed to England her language, literature, and laws, as well as civil and religious freedom, bat, great as was the obligation, she would more than have repaid aU if England would take from America the great principle of protecion from intoxicating drinks. The question of temperance had made steadyprogresin Amerca, and wbatever England might do, America would have this protection. They appealed to the Leislature in Maine without success, for they were many of tbem interested rtie and they then appealcd to the people, who through the ballot-box swept out and decimated the opposing legi,dators till the place that had known them kneow them no more for ever and if the people of England wanted such a law, they must get it in the same way. It was a political as well ag moral question, becauso it involved thel waste of enormous capital, of the physical power of the people, of food, raiment, and shelttr for the people, and o the education of the rising generation. In Anericait was an axiom th3ttheir free institutions conld not bo perpetuated except by an intelligent and highly educated people, and the drinking customs kept hundreds of thousands of children away from the free schools. England was the most wealthy and powerful nation that ever existed, but she had within her more poverty, suffering. panuDism, and mcime than had ever been in any nation under the sun, and for all these she had to thank the trafflo in intoxicating drnks. Let those who said the law had been a failure in Maine, and those who doubted whether it had been a sucss. wait. He had no doubt the tesult would be an saknowledged triumphant succe-s. Mr. Dow was loudly applauded. GRzEAT Fint n; LrvzRpoor.-Liverpool, April 24.-A fire broke out in a fine stack of warebouse in Sparl.

Now, Sir, 1,100 yards is a very nioe distance for one mmr to hit another at-in fact, if you will take the troule to try and cover a man satisfactrily with the sight of your rifle a that distance you wil find it a !ery diffipult matter% a' the difficulty perLsps would be -increased If you observe& thaM he was engaged in a imiLar operation wiet4 a licetil intentagainst your person. Bult, kppoising itis a 9-poundrgun tbat is before you, what is the chance y6u wfil haveor kling any one of the gunners artnd it? I can teil yog that the best rifleman, crouching down behind stones, aniD firing from inconvenient natural rests at objeect which he knows are about to work him mischief, is a very difbent beinig, as far as his practi goes, from the same riflemazi firinx at an inanimte and inoffensive body from a rest, an& at his ase, But, uppose the gun to be fired with ahrap.. nel, not lessthan 35 or 36 bas and splinters of iron wilt be hurled against the rifleman, and at 1,100 yards they will striko within av ery *hort area around him, and with good senioe the gun caD be loaded, iaid, and fird almost as ba as the rifle can be effectively adusted and discharged. Unquestionably the fire of arms of precision will prove tz.- blesome to light artiller. The limits of the ordinary use of shrapnel are 1,050 yards. Even 6-pounder caue, at 1,100 yards, goes at the rate of 470 feet a second, and on hardleveL ground Ishould have no fear of clearing my front of riflemen. in two minutes Of course no artillery offSoer would take his guns into a pla cere he would be exposed to the fir of covered riflemen. Against cavalry the effect of improved arms may be grater than against artillery, but I do not anticipate such dediive results as aome of your correspondentg. seem to assume. Sir, I saw the famous volleys of the 93& Regiment at Balsclava. The Russian cavalry came close enough, and yet I do not believe that heavy fire of Mllnie rifles, delivered by steady troops at a short distan emptied ha)f-ado-en addles I As a usual rule wher cavalry is about to charge guns or infantry, supposing it to be at 1,000 ards distanoe, it trots the first 400 yrds ixt )ess than five mirutea-mind, it is always moring; the next 400 yards it gets over in two minutes three seconds ; and the last 200 yards, at the charge, in 30 seconds, tha whole time being over seven minutes. Now, a gun could in that time fire rina rounds of round shot for the first 4C0 yard one ditto and two of case for the next. 400, and two rounds of cse during the last 200 yards, and if the number of rounds be multiplied by the number of guns in a battery andthe number of buUets in eo spherical ease, it will be found that the fire is tremendos; and yet daring horsermen will, s we have seen, ehre guns, and begin, not at 1,000 yards, but at smile and a half from. them. The error in which we seem likely to fall is to suppose that all men who are fit to be soldiers wiU be fit to be riflemen. Bad infantry-men who fire too high nd huail -wil be no better, but rather worse, if armed wits weapons of precision and long range. Some men nevercan lea*n distanoes. Many men, indeed, as every musetryinstructor knows, are quite unteachable, and random, wide firing willalways prevail among stupid or inexperiencegd troops, be they using Enfield, Whitworth, or old Brown. Bess. I hav known of many thousand rounds being 6red by a regiment with the return of one man kiUled and two Woundedon the part of the enemy, and yet these troogs were old bhnds, taught by instructors, and provided with Minis. I am oonvinoed that wo ought to have corefullyselected corps of riflemen, or light companies, the pick of the regiment, selected for intelligence and skill, and theirfire would be worth, at long ranges, for either guns oLcavalry, the fire of all the rest of their comrades. As to naval gunnery, the name principle seems to holdL good. Even a three-decker offers a small mark at 3,000 yards, and if I were in the Duke of Wellington, and eould move her slong with an easy helm and good powee of steam, I ould snap my fingers at all the Merrimacs or liagars in. the world. If one of these smart frigates can come within. any distance which gives him a chance of hitting one of my size, it is odd if I canuot, with my 10-inch guns and my broadsides of long 65 cwt, guns and 32-pounders, mako ver pretty practioe at him. Besides, he will be as big as myself I should regret ver7 much if the discussion and the experimental investigations respeoting hee topics are allowea to drop. Your obedient LsTa3,&.

The French Government received despatches yesterday from Jassy,whloh are noT;very encouraging nCo far as the union of the Prnoipalities is con. corned. These despatches, which were read at the Council yesterday, refer to the efforts made by Austria and the Porto against the object which the French Government has so much at heart, and which it took care to announce to the world long sinoe in the Moniteur. It is expected that a note wvil be addressed to the Ottoman Government remonstrating against the decided partiality shown by the Moldavian Government in favour of the anti-Unionists. Now, the Porte may be presumed to have some interest in the question; if the Moldavian Govemment interfere in the matter, or try to prejudge it, it is as competent for it to do so as for the French Government. The 21st of June is, it appears, the day fixed for the elections to the new Legisative Corps. The Government will not communicate its lists until after the departure of the present deputies to their provinces. Further changes among tho prefects have been spoken of for some time; nothing of any moment will probably be done for the present in order not to disturb the great electioneering machinery, but it Is belioved that a comprehensive sweep of thewe functionaries will take place soon after the returns are made known. A letter from Toulon of the 21st informs us that the Grand Duke Constantine that day minutely examined the arsenal and all its oranches. At 25 minutes past 10 a salute from the Muiron announced hIs Imperial Highness's departure from the Pre- fecture. A line was formed by the troops of the garrison. The Duke proceeded to the arsenal in a cariage, accompanied by Admiral Dubourdieu, General Todtleben, and his physician. He was saluted on entering the arsenal with 21 gtms from a battery erected for the occason in the dockyard. The inhabitants of Toulon remarked that this ws only the third time such a compliment was paid during 25 years. The first was when Admiral Bruat embarked for the Crimea, and the second on the arrival of his remains. On entering the iron and copper works the Duke measured several srticle% with a sort of yard he carried in hia hand. Thence he proceeded to the store where sails and sailcloth are preserved, and afterwards examined thi oil stores. He next proceeded in a carriage to the deplt of artillery. Having Inspected the great guns, he visited the armoury. He expressed his satisfaction at the taste displayed in the arrangement of the arms. He stopped there a long time, and asked the use of various weapons with which he appeared to be unacquainted.T He was constantly followed throughout by his aides-de-camp. He next embarked in the Imperial barge, which was rowedthroughthedocks. The Admiralhavingdirected his attention to the frigate ImpCratice Eug6nie, preparing for sea, he went round her, examined the screw and asked many questions. While the Grand Duke was thus employed General Todtleben was carefully examining the docks constructed for the building and repair of steamvessels. The Duke reminaned in the hold of the Imp6ratrice Eugenie for more than half-an-hour. This frigate is built on a new model. She is of 800-horse power, which may I be increasedlto 1,200. She has eight boilers and I 32 furnace.. Eight more frigates are being built on the same plan. The Duke then embarked for the new dock-yard of the Castignean. He examined anj to be seen in that yard as carefully as in the other, and then returned to the Prefecture to partake of EoMe refreehment. At 2 dclock the Duke embarked again, and proceeded to the roads to visit the ships of war. On a signal given the yards were manned. On mounting tuhe Bretagne the seamen presented arms, and the crew cheered with crles five l1mes repeated of " Vive ZMnpereurP' He remained there above an hour, while several manceuvres were performed at his command. Be next visited the Algesiras, and afterwards the frigate Audacleuse, a simikr ceremony taklng place on each occadon. He was much pleased and affected to find that his first visit to Toulon, 11 years since, was not forgotten, and to see his portrait in the saloon of the Prefecture, it being painted in 1846. At that period the Grand Duke gave 5,000f. to the poor, and the Municipal Council, in remembrance of that event, had his portrait taken. The official journal of the Two Sicilies announces that King Ferdinand II. had, on the occaion of the feitval of Easter, pardoned 24 persons sentenced to imprisonment. The names of the persons are given, but the crimes for which they were incarcerated are not mentioned. The same journal announces that the telegraphic line from Catanzaro to Nicastro, Monteleone, Palmi, and Reggio. had been opened to the public on the 8th inst. Several citizens of Carregglo, in the Duchy of Modena, had sent 110f. towards the subscription for purchasing cannon for Alessandria.

'VE1NN, Arun 2L There has been a considerable decline in all kinds of induswtrel stock during the last two or three days, and It is said to have been caused by the endeavours nmaie by some of the conceesionaries of the Russian railroads to palm upon the leading Vienna houses a part of their shares. The Vienna men of business are ready enough to take a share in a speculation when they see a fair chance of profit, but most unwiling to do so if they fancy that nothing is to be gained. In short, the Austrian bankers and merchants would fain have nothing whatever to do with the Rusian railroads, but the French Cr6dit Mobilier has given some of them many shares in several very good speculations, and they are therefore unable to refuse to take a few in a very bad one. The Ost-Deuise rost to-day mourns over those unfortunate speculators who have so deliberately walked into the trap laid for them by the Rusdans. The paper in question, maliciously observes, that in the prospectus which has been issued no mention iA made of the probable profit arising from the feathers of those birds which fall to tle earth as victims to the mephitic exhalations of the Putrid Sea, between (Geltoh and Arabat, on the road from New Russia to thev Crimea. -any prson who is in pouaron oe his fire waes ;ili take the troublo to look at ten !Ai!s bthe roied RPssiau railroads, he o*thi lat. qY&6fo9Mtzkteg&rAie Iz poosam.- ~ oo'~ ti as Mig antarts hasy bem mX& , tiso 'npo~, aM Jzupuu t w ~ gary :-As their Majesties rill leave Vienna by steam as soon a it is lighatn 1he 4th of 4ay,jhq. wDI go on brd on the evenin.g of th9 preceding da".

Eight magnii'icent gray horses,'whiick are i drwthe State carri age from the bank of the river up to the castle at Buda, have, already been sent by rail to Perlth. On the 30th 60 body guard, under the command of the Marshal and Captain of the " Arcibre Guard," Count Wratislaw, will leave for the Hungarian capital. Some 80 or 100 horses from the Imperil stables and the nece carriages will also be sent on. by rail before their Majesties leave this city. During his tour in Hubgarythe Emperor will twice come uptoVienna, ilrtto see the Agriculltural Exhibition, and then to attend the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the military order of Maria Theresa. The order was founded in comm-e moration of the battle fought at Colin in 1757 between the Austrians and Prussians. The GrandMaster of the Order is the Emperor. The three Grand Crosses are worn by, the Archduke John. and Marshals Radetzky and Windischgrxtz. The seven Commanders are Marshal Count Nugent, Count Jellachich, Baron Hess, Count Thurn, the Archduke Albrecht, Count Wmunpffen, and CountSchlick. There are 82 Austian Knights, and, four foreign Commanders and 29 Knights. One of the foreiga Knights is the Earl of Westmorland, and (I believe) Sir Charlex Napier is another. During thelasttwoyears.the Vienna Municipality has been making a collection for a monument which it is proposed to erect to the memory of MIozart, in the cemetery on the Schmelz, butto the eternal disgraceo~f the music-loving Autrians be it said-only 199i1. (191.1&S.) have been sub. scribed. The Austrian Government is trying hard to petsuade the French to make some change in their postal arrangements, which are totally unworthy of such a highly civilized nation. A letter goes from Caron,tat, in Tranalvania, to Cologne, in Prusia, for 9 kreuzes (3jd. 1nglish), butthe postage of a letterfromViennatoPscoats29kreuzers (llid. English). Letters are frequently addressed to me from various pai of France, but It rarely happens that the proper stainp aire on them. I the stamps are one halfpenny less than the prescribed postage, the letters are here treated az it no stamp at all were on them. Since the, cheap postage system ha s been introduced into Austria the revenue of the Post-ofce Department has increased rather than dininished. The Gene7al Committee of the Agricultuial Exbibition officially announces that the murrain has not spread in Moravia and Silesia. The complaint is sporadi, and has only affected cattle which have been driven into those provinces. However, to tranquilize the exhibitors, a promise has been given that their cattle shall be brought to Vienna on the Northern Railroad in new waggons constructed for the purpoae.

Russian press on politicoeconomical subjects the various journalists profit by the unusual degree of liberty allowed them to express their sentiments on the various topics of the day with a degree of candour which. considering that these expressions can also be read in foreign countries, is, to say the least of it, very tuif. In the Russian prews s for home consumption " we have hithertobadthebestantidotes againstallthe seductive statements put forth in the continental organs of " la haut0 fiAance" in favour of the grand railway network scheme of MM Pereire and Co. We find also that, while the shares of the Russian Commercial and Navigation CompanT have been subscribed for rapidly and exclusively by Rusian capital, and other smaller undertakings, such as that of the " Hydrostat," for raising snken vessels, meet with considerable favour, nevertheless the number of shar in the much-vaunted railway scheme permitted to be offered for subscription in Russia.is confined to 150,000, being only one-fourth of the first issue of 600,000 shares at SOOf. each, said representing little more than 1-15th of the entire capita eontemplated, viz*, 1,100,000,000 franca The cause of this restriction in the amount of shares to be offered for subscription in Russia appears, however, not to be solely the very questionable nature of the investment itself, nor even the'twofold desirableness of attracting foreign capital to the country, and not enhancing the value of the capital that is already available there, but maybe traced in a very considerable degree to the necessi -he Government is under of withholding a tempting opportu. nity to the proprietors of dormant capital in Russa to withdraw their deposits from the Government banks, where they get only 4 per cent. for their money, and embark t in undertakings where the same Government guarantees 5 per cent. as a minimum. If this explanation be correct, the enigma is at once solved why the Government should permit the prospects of this undertaking, one of such vital lmportance to the country, to be portrayed sO dark;ly by the home prerss and the liberal purchases made by the Imperial family ot of the limited number of shares allotted to Russa will be understood at once as the mere endeavour to put so many shares out of reach of their subjects. The rate of interest in Russia is generally about 8 per cent.; this high rate arises not so much from want of capital as from want of confidence in commercial transactions, and from the very unsatisfactory nature of the legisation for the protection of the creditor. There Is plenty of money lying idle in the country,-not only in the form of specie in the hands of the population but also deposited at 4 per cent, intere.t ln the Government banks, and that, too, in despite of the numerous and flagrant tricks that haye been played with those deposits from time to time. I is now tolerably notorious that these bank institutions were established by a former Minister of Finance, M. Cancrin, mainly for the purpos of providing the Government with a fund of ready money, available on any sudden emergency; thcse is whch the State helped itself to were replaced, when any inauspicious conjuncture supervened to cause a withdrawal of deposits, by loans raised In Amterdam and London, or by a freh issue of paper money "for the strengthening of the Exchequer." It was in all probability to meet, among other obligations, a demand for the repayment of deposits that the Government lately issued a fresh series of Exchequer or Treasury notes, bearing interest; and, if this be so, we have at once an answer to the very obvious question, why do not these bank insitu tions, which only pay 4 per cent. on +their deposits, themselves purchase the whole 150,000 shares on which the Government guarantees 5 per cent.? They would clear on the trancion one per cent. per annum on 75,000,0oof. The Governmentbanks of Russia have either mnade over to the Government the deposits intrusted to them at 4 per cent., or they have employed them in commercial transactions at a higher rat: - posing them to have funds available, they do not like the security offered them by the railroad speculation of MIL.I ereire and Co. While on the subject of Runian finance, it may be worth while to note that the Russian Government is, totally irrespective of any unusual claim, on its ]Exchequer on account of war or other extraordinary expense, always striving to increase its foreign debt, if only as a means of providing for the discharge of the balance of trade, dwhch is always against Russia. That country imports always, even in times of peac, from 30 to 40 per cnt. more goods than it exports; to meet this unfavourable osiane, paper money cannot be exported, as from the illegaiity of its re-importation it can have no value abroad, and to export specie to meet it would, not only be ruinously expensive, except under some favourable turn of the gold prime, but would at any rate drain the oountry of its specie entirely in a very few year To provide its own merchants with bills for rermittance to the foreign creditor it is worth the Government's while continually to contract fesh loans abroad, eventhough it should, from any improbable amplitude of its own resourc, be forcd to turn moneyplender at home itself; the latter business, moroover, canet be unprofitable, snce the rate of interest paid m the commer.W world there if alway considerably higher than tha t GoYvenmt pays the fdreig lside, plU all expase of ati , ice, hke nwo ONut no*e fom st P ien% s ip i' of the puP iefAtn of the ow tariff an deliberation,- o thiX bi j te n he.ocapital- htaasjdsity-and enaO., andwe Rgven to understand:that the publication of the tar will be ompamed.by new CutOmaFegulstonz, . the ejot of* which will b le the de1i4 verance of commerce from the nlmerouarlom form and pr.oces.sesithi:whiolz.aUiimporO buniess has hitherto been hampered i Ru The loss of MI.

We owed a deep debt to literal IsraeL We h.d reoeived the Gospe from them, and surely it behoved us to give it back to them. TheAhonoray Secretary read the reporl of the committee, which stated that there was at the commencement of the year a snm of money in hand which had enabled the work to be carried on until the time of the year at which the greater part of the income was received Tht work wAs now being carried on by 19 missIonaries, and its prospects were of a highly favourable chaacter. An effortsda been made to establish a Jewish school, which, though for a time suspended, was again in operation. The committee had engaged Mr. Benjamin Da idson to visit the several missonaries In England, and to reside with eacb for a few weeks at a time; and this measmre had already been attended with favourable results. From the foreis min ons the committee ha with some exceptions, receyved reports of a most encouraging character. Einanclally, relaively, and Inluentiall the present position of the society was one which inspired gratitude, confidence, and expecttion. The income had been adequae to the spenditure of the soclety, but the tunes required more exiergetlc action. The report concluded with an appeil to benevolent Christians for incred pecuniay and moral support for the exertions of this society for the conversion of the ancient people of God. The honorary secretary also read the statement of accounts, from which it appeared that at the commence. ment of the year the society bad in hand a baLance of 8601. l1I 3d. The income of the soiety had been 4,2861. han. ad., ita expenditure 4,0451. 3s. 4d., and it now had in hand aL balance of 1,1011. 18g. 4d. The Rev.

He stted that at the commencement of the present centurythere ws not in this idland a single Jerw who had been convered to chriAtity, while at the present moment the number of such converta amounted to 200,ODO, of whom 200 were preachers of the GospeL These facts ought to afford great encouragement to the committee and members of this society to pursue the good work in which they were engaged The resolution wee seconded by the Rev. I. WISnMLx, and unanimously adopted, The Rev. 1L OCuLLAGH moved a declaratory resolutlon expressing the sympathy of the meeting with the objects and openations of this society. Instead of neglecting the spiritual condition of the Jewrs, he contended that our first and most earnest missionary efforts ought, following the example set us by our Lord and E[is anostles, to be directed to their conversion. The Rev. Jixs F XG seconded the resolution, and, like its predecessors, it was adopted without any dissentients. Thanks were voted to the two chairmen of the evening, and the proceedings terminated about 9 oclock.

Subsequentl to the 1st of Zinuary, 1851, the tenant for life died, said leaoyv of 260L thereunon be. came payable. By .the 3san4th of Willamn TV., a. 27, a 40, it is eatedhat no prooeding sal 'be brought to recover any um of money charged upon or paable out of land at law or in eqty, orny legacy, but,wi", n 2Qears next after a present right to receive the same shall have acsrdd to some person capable of givinga discharge for or release of the same, unlessome art the princdil money or . some. interest-thereon habll lave been paid, or some acknowledgment of the riglttherel6biall have been given in wizlng in the mea.ntime.signed by-the person to whom the same shall be payable, By, the 19th 'and 20h of Victoria, c.

There was noig, in his opinion, to justify the propoe'tion that, because the right to recover-the debt wa extinguished, the aPslgment . way of maor4gage ceased to have any ffect . - It as d ct to see how the 19th and 20th Vict,on, C.

M Y.WAnTRr, .C., resumed the arguments on behalf of the plaintiff in this case, and Was followed by Mr. Lococx The ase as presented to tho CouArt ws as follows --The plantiff, who is a liaboirng gardener, at Louth, in TIn. cobuhire, claimis 1 be'the heir-atlaw of his grandfather, Stote fanby, and, through him, of Dorbthy Windsor, who died in the year 1766, seInd of large estate in Newcse. upon-Tyne and in Northumberland; the relief sought by the plaintiff's bill being to-have hli title as such heir-at-law esta. blishad to recover poseion of these etates from the defendant4 the present owners,. anA (with a view to:this end) to'set aside, a obtained by neeret fraud and collusion, a certin compromise come to in the year 1781, under which all rght then claimed In the property by the plaintiff's grand. father (no dalleged to have been imbecile), and also the right. of William Hanby, the plaintis father (also alleged to hbae-been inoompetent), becAme vtd in the predecsors of the present defendant.. Dorothy Windsor, the widow of Dhie Winudsor, and daughter of Sir Richard Stote, diel intesate and without 9isse at the ageof 86. On her death. no heir being then forthcomong 'and a memorial having been preferred b LIrd Visdount Windsor, her husband's nepher, to the Lords 'Cosmissloenrs of the Treury, on the ground of certain testamentary intentions, -expressed b ,t never formally executed by Dorothy Windsor In his favour, the Crown appointed Lord- Visount Windsor rdeeiver of the estates. That nobleman died in the following year, and thereou n, in the languae of one of the learned counsel or the plaintiff, the eagles soon flocked and attempted to pounce upon the goodly crcase. Claims by esoheatwere made byseveral of the lords of the manors of wrhich the estates were held, and among them by Sir Walter Blackett, lord of the manor of Kirkheaton, who however eventually gave up their claims in favour of the two persons who next appear upon the seneL. These two persons, named Robert Bewicke (afterwards Sir RoberS Bewloke) rnd John Craster, in 1758, each alleging his heirship to Dorothy Windsor, as being descended from remote anceetors of her father, Sir Richard Stote (the first purchaser of the estates), entered into po. session, procuredattornments fromthetennta6,andcametoan agreement between themselves that they wouldjointly prose. cute their rights -at their joint expense, and that the property should be held by them when secured in equal moieties as tenants in common. Various legal proceedings were taken by them againsttheltenantsand other and oertainshadowy claims vaguely asserted by a father and son of the name of Stote (claiming under an inferior title to that now alleged by the plaintiff) having been quieted, Bewicke and Craster succeeded in 1762 in establishing their posesion, which they retained until their death, some time previous to 1780. About this perlod a new claimant appeared in the nrson of the-laint.s bgrandfbther.Stotehaby,anilliterte bourer, in the neighbourhood of Louth. Born in 1717, he was alleged to be a grndson of Cuthber Mote, nephew of Sir Richard Stote, who, as already stated, was the father of Dorothy Windsor. According to the plaintiff's case Stote Hanby, who -was a very poor and illikrate man, had some time previously to 1757 received a kickfrom a horse, which inflicted a severea nijuy upon his skull. The fratuted bones were replaced by a silver plate (an operation looked upon in thome days as a miracle of surgery), and Stote Manby in some measure recovered lik phyical heailtb, but hs mind was permanently affected, and he remained from that time in a state of mental 3mbecliity, dependent upon the labour of his wife and casual charity for the mierable pittnce upon which he existed in a wretched mud hovel, alternatele the ity and the laughingstockof the-eople of Louth. William anby, the son of Stote Manby (and therefore father of the plaintiff), was alleged to have been from his birth,- in [ 1747 of weak intellect, and commonly knowrn as "Silly Billy." That from 1790 this wrealrness msesmed the character-of utter imbecility, and that he continued from that period down to his death, in 1809, of unsound mind, and wholly unable to. perform any business requiring the slightest mental capacity. He lived in most abject poverty, and left, at his death, two sons by a second m rara'e, the eldest of whom, Richard Stote Manby, died in 1820, having been attacked by a dangerous illness within a few months of his attaining 21, which reduced him until his death to a state of unsound mind. The younger, who was theureeent plairtiff, William Stote Manby, attained 21 in 182?. According to the plaintiff's case some time in the year 1780 Stote Manby was sougAt out by one Harvoy, an attorney of Newcastle, who -then first com. municated to him and his wifehisbeirship to Dorothy Windsor, and the rightfol owner of her estates An action of ejectment-was -brought by Harvey, as attorney of Stote Manby, against CulverleJ Bewicke and Daniel Craser, the parties then inposioni which was unsucoessful. In the following year (1781) Harvey, as attorney for Stote hfanby, broughtworeal actions bywrits of "cousinae" against Bewlike and Craster, one of such writs being in respect of the,property in Newcastle, the other in reepect of tho residue of the estates in Northumberland. The irst of these actions was tried at the NewcastleAiee on the 16th of November, 1781,- and a verdict was obtained by Stobe Xafimb thauxdeciding that Bewilekeand Craster were anlawfully seloed, 3ind inbAnfy sUiblishinz t tle of StoteMinbyavs hel wo3 lorofy Wiit r.

To asertain the nature of the compromise he must lookat the position of the parties on the morning of the triil of the second action, and that alone, for Harey had hitherto been acting most hostilely to BeWicke And Craster.

This was the only evidence then uged, and the only evidence which could have been urged, for there was nothing else, till the documentary evidenoe which had been discovered in prosecuting the present suit, to corroborate the stxtement of Ann that she was tho niece of Sir Richard Stot.. There was then no evidence of her marriage with William Manby; later evidence, indeed, had been disbovered, but that had no bearing upon the compromise.

The action was brought against the defendant as surety upon a bond. The plea set out the condition that one Wor'ey, who had been appointed colleetor of income, tro. per. and asaessed taxes which bad been or thereat tr should be charged or aesed within the parish of Dudleay under or by virtue of the veal Acts relating to the sd dutle, should faithfullydi,chargebis duty as such collector. The plea also alleged that the bond was executed before the 25th of ay, 185D, when the Act was passed which granted an inceased duty of 2d. in the pound for one year after the ratification of the peeae, and that the moneys in respect of iMhichthe collectorhad made defaultwere in part due under the old and partly under the new Act. To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and this raised the question whether there was such an alteration in the office and duties of the collector as would render the bond void. Mr. PHIPSON s heard in support of the demurrer, and contended that the bond was intended to appl to all duties which nmight become due under fhture as well as the then ex KnO5VIES. Q O. (with whom was Wr. Quain), was stopped by Lord COxpnELr~who said that, according to general prin. ciples the notion could not be uaned.

Justice Williams, when a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to leave reserved to move to enter the verdict for the defendant ; or for a nonsuit. Mr. PFrErssDoUFF now moved accordingly. The plain. tiff, it appeared, had effected a policy of insurance with the company, ard by the terms of the policy the funds of the comupany only were to be liable, and the direotors were not to be personaUy responsdble. The plaintiff in his declaration complained that the defendants had wrongfully transferred the nds of the company to another company, called the Anglo-Australian Company, and had thus ineapacitated and disabled themselves from performing their covenant with tho plaintiff. The defendants denied this by their pleas. Rule 7isi granted. HODGiGINSON V. YEIMNE. In this case Mr. Serjeant BYLEs and Mr. NEDHAM showed cause against a rule nwsi obtained last term, and MIr. EDW,&mD JUiES, Q.C., and Mr. QuAN appeared in support of it. The action was brought by the owners of a ship called the Sultana against the owners of another ship called the Oonrier for damage resulting from a collision in the Black Sea. Both vesseis, it appeared, wvro hired transports, enged in convyisgtroops on the expedition from Varna to Inpatoria. Her Majesty's ship Fury had the Orient and the or in tow, and the Hydaspes had the Sultana and the Sir Robert Sale in tow. General orders were given at ni ht with regard to the anchoring of the vessels, of waich thero were about 600 proceeding in four lines. The vessels in tow were to obey the orders of the ships towing them. The commander of the Fury ordered the Orient and the Courier at night not to cast anchor, but to remain hanging on by their tow ropes, unless they were in danger of parting. In the course of the night the breeze freshened, and, these vessels swinging round to the wind, the Courier cane in collision with the Sultana's bows and inflicted considerable damage, to recover compensation forwhich this action was brought. The Lord Chief JusUtice, at the trial, directed the jury that if they believed the Courier's not anchoring was in consequence of the orders she received she being under the command of the Fary, which towed her, the plaintiff, having entered his vessel in the fleet subject to these conditions, could not recover against the defendant, who had simply obeyed orders, which they were both bonud to obey: and secondly, had the defendant's veinel been managed in an unseamanlike manner, if the defendant, by letting go his anchor, would have preventod the mischief, that ought to have been done. The jury found a vrdict for the plaintiff, and on the Latter part of tho ruling Of the learned judge a rule ni.si was obtained for misdirection. On the part of the plaintiff it was contended that the ruling was right, and that the defendant was, under the eircurnstances, responsible, as he could have prevented the mischief by dropping his anchor. On the part of the defendant it was urged that the defendat was acting under obedience to the orders of Her Maesty, and that this was an action which could not be maintained in a court of law. The Courier, it was urged, was under martial law, and bound to obey the orders given by the commander of the Fury, and was not resposible for any damaoe which obedionce to those orders entailed on others, and tnat the principle of responmaet surpcrior pplied. The argument was not concluded when the dourt rose. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at (GuildJlml, before Mr. Justice WxIxAss and a Common Jury.)

COIURT OF EXCTMOTRER FRmnAV AroTr. 9A SYMONDS V. X'NAMARA. (Sitti7w in BtnRoaI 1 us was arn action to recover akamages from the london General Omnibus Society for injury austained by the plaintiff while stepping out of an omnibus, it being alleged that the condutor had negligently omitted to remove from the footboard a lump of ice on which the plaintiff had p4t his foot. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, though the defendant's contention was that the faU of the plaintiff was not attributable to the ice, and, if it were, the ice had accumulated under ciroumstances which absolved the servant of the company from the imputation of negligence. MIr. JA7si now moved to set aside the verdict, on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence to support it. Mr. Bkron WATsox, however, reported to the Court that he had left the question of negligence entirely to the jury, and that he did not dissent from their verdict thereupon. The COURT refused the rule. IN RE DAVIS. Mr. LANGFORD moved for a writ of habeas corpus to discharge one D.vis on the ground of the alleged defective character of the warrant of commitment, which was under the Rogne and Vagabond Act, 6th George IV., chap. 83, Eect. 4. That document stated that the said Davis, beingra suspected person at the Dowamarket Railway station, the same being a place of public resort, did frequent the platform of the same statioa with intent to comamit felony, contrary to the -at. The objection taken to this warrant by the learned counsel woa -that it omitted to state that the platform was n. place of public -resort. The COURT, however, said they would take judicial notice of the fact that the platformn Of everY railway station, which was itself alleged4 to be a public pla, was also a'public place.-Rule -refused. NFRw TRIAL PAPER. IC OOTfl V. KENNARD. Sir F. T 'ESIR&E, Mr. EN[IjMARSH, and hlr.

Mr. hlacaulay and Mr. We'cster appeared in support of the rulo for the plaintiff. *The COUT, after a lengthened argument, which turned euthe construction of the specification and the alleged want of-novelty, tobk time to consider its judgment. A.RAHAMS V. MUESOME AND WIFE. This was a rule to set aside a nonasLit. The action was in sl.ander, with special damage, and the words were, " You aite a returned transport, with a ticket of leave," and the declaration alleged that, by reason of such words, one "I,rsrefused to deal with the plaintiff. 'Tooprove the special damage the traveller of Mr. Myers was called, who stated-that he had refused to deal, but that Mr. Myers, his principal, knew nothing of the slander or of such refusaL The Chi6f Baron then, on the assumption that the words in the declaration were not actionable without special damuage,held that the act of Mr. Myers' traveller was not the act of that gentleman whose personal opinion and conducat were vouebed by the declaration. Ire there., fore~nonsnited the plaintiff.

' SIr. L. TzMp3i;, for the plaintiff, contended thatthe adt! of the agent of lMr. Myers was tho act of the prinripal.ofi whose behalf he had refused to deal. The COURT suggested that the words declared on verb actionable in themselves, and if so the proof of special damage became immxnaterial. Would it not be better for the parties to agree to a giet pi-ocesMsu 7 ventualiyafter muchi discussion, the case was allowed to stand over in thc hope that the parties would settle their quarrel in the way proposed. Judgment deferred accordingly. AMrBROSE V. COOK. This was a rule to set aside a verdict for 2471. in an aetion on a bond for 8COl. to recover that balance. The defendait pleaded his discharge under the Ineolvent Act, and that the bond was given as security for the debt from which the defendant was so discharged. The questions were, whether those defences were supported by the evidence, and whether the facts proved at the trial brought the case within the operation of the statute for the relief of insolvent debtors. Mr. Petersdorff'appeared for the defendant; Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Joseph Brown were counsel for the plain. tiff, but were not called on to support the verdict, The CoURT was of opinion that under all the circumstances of the case the plaintiff was fully entitled to recover the amount for which the verdict passed at the trial. Rule discharged. (Sitngs at Nisi PrEus, befose MIr. Baron WATSON and Common Juries.) KNG V. WLBURIN. This was an action for an alleged breach of promise of marriage.a The defendant pleaded that he never made the promise of marriage as alleged. I Mr. Knowles and MIr. Cleasby appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. AL Chambers and Mr. Price for the defendant. The learned COUNSEn, in opening the plaintiff's case,said, she was a young lady, the daughter of a surgeon, residing atAmpleforth, in Yorkshire, and the defendant was the son of a clergyman, who had been for many years the curate of that place. The defendant began in 1855, while the families were on a visit to Scarborough, to pay marked. attentions to the plaintiff, end he had written a letter to the plaintiff's father, aekng his consent and representing himself as being in a position to get married. The plaintiff's father, knowing the defendant's family very intimately, tfter some inquiries gave his consent, and the two young people arranged that their marrisge should take place in October last. For some reason the wedding was to take place in London, and at the defendant's request the plaintiff's brother, who lived in London, took lodgings in t)ctober, which his sister was to occupy until she was married. The plaintiff accordingly came uP to London, and WaS daily expecting the defendant to come to town to marry her. As he did not come in accordance 'ith his promise, she wrote several letters to him, of which he took no notice; but eventually he wrote the forlowing letter to the plaintifF's father:- Catharine CoUege, Cambzidge, NOT. 1, M8$. mPy intentlen to ar.Iwiet r fyncntl ewo a the oriUzaaors aind promeulgators of rsurh falsehood?7 I keep eon- tbonghd eecbeh case I ,woul d was going s°ane hi wishes.a more when the scandalous report JJ nothing mere than a wiu was heo&' "l~~~~~~~am youro, EJ. B.1. WJSL13UIN." The plaintiff, on hearig of the behaviour of the defendant, came alarningly ill, and bad two medical gentlemen in constant attendance upon her. This action had been brought to protect the fair fame of the plaintiff and indemnify her for the heartless manner in which she had been treated by the defendant. The following evidence was adduced in support of this statement:- Miss Lucy King said, her father resided with his family at Ampleforth, in Yorkshire. Her father was a surgeon. rhe defendant's father was a clergyman. His father was for' a considerable time the curate at Ampleforth. She knew the defendant; he was at college at Cambridge. When he was athome housed frequently to visit at their house. He used to pay attention to her sister Alicia. On the ls of January he came to the house in the evening, and gave her sister a ring. It was a diamond and pearl ring. He expressed a wish that she should wear it at a party they vere going to at his father's house on the 3d of January, He iade a propoal of marriage to her at the same time. He askea her if sle would marry him the following May, but she put it offuntil October. She said she shouldnot bepre. pared until that time. He was very persevering in his attentioia. Theyfrequentlywalked out together alone. It was arranged that the plaintiff and the defendant should be married in London. The plaintiff came to London in October. She foRlowed the plaintiff in a few days. She was to act as bridesmaid. Everything was prepared for the wedding except the wedding dress. The defendant said he should buy that in London himself. Alltheir friends at Ampleforth knew the purpose for which the plaintiff came to London. It was generally reported that the plain. tiff was goina to be married in London, and she bade aU her friends adieu when she came up to town. On witncss's arrival in London she found the plaintiff in a very bad state in consequence of the absence and silence of tho defendant. The plaintiff had written twice to him, but had received no answer. She also wrote a letter to the defendant, telling him how irl her sister was, and entreating him to come t'o her. The defendant took no notice of that letter. The plaintiff continued Dil a very long time. Two medical gentlemen attended her. Cross-examined.-The frst time the defendant made any propo'al to the plaintiff was on the 1st of January last year. at was in the house of the plaintiff's father. WItness was present at the time. The ring was given at the same time The plaintiff was 25 years old. The defendant was 22 That was their age atthe present time. They were younger of course when the defendant made the proposal She asked thedefendant how he was supported at college. He said he was no expense to his father. The defendant's mother was alive. The defendant had two brothers and two sisters. One of the sisters was called Margaret. The defendant was the eldest son. Margaret was 17 years old. They went to Margaret's birthday party soon after the de. fendant made the proposal. Margaret was a very nice girl. 'Witness did not tell Margaret about the approaching marriage between their families. It was never mentioned to her. Witness did not know that the whole thitg was kept dark. Witness told her own father. The plaintiff went with her on a visit to the defendant's father. They 'went to York in August, where they saw their brother and the defendant. It was then arranged that they should go up to town in October to be married. Her sister did go to town in October. The plaintiff received 12 or 14 letters from the defendant. The plaintiff only wrote about six or seven to him. The lodgings in London were taken at 26, Tachbrook.street, Pimlico. Thoy consisted of two rooms. They were to have been the wedding a.partments. The plaintiff remained in London for some time, and then returned to her father. The plaintiff had formerly been a governess, but for the last five or six years she had kept her father's house. She did not recollect the defendant sayIng that he had a fellowship at college. 1e-examined.-Her sister was dangerously ill for some time. Mr. John King said, he was the plaintiff's father, and was a surgeon at Ampleforth where he had resided for 30 years. The defendant's father had been curate of that place for 23 years. Their families were intimate. In January, 1856, he received a letter from the defendant asking his consent to the proposal he had made to his daughter. He eventtally gave his consent to their marriage. He was aware that the young people were attached to each other before that. He sawthe defendant's father in August. That gentleman -sid he knew all about the affair. His son was walking the hosPIta a-t that time and lived in London. Cross-examined.-Rle had not always been prosperous. He had lost all his money in a Durham colliery swindle. lie had been insolvent in 1847. He had become insolvent for the purpose of clearing himself from the swindling transaction. He gave up the whole of his property. He could no t have giv-en his daughter any money at her mar- ria. H ew the defendant was to have purchased the wding des _e-eaiEned._The defendant's father was now perpetual curate of Poppertn, in Yorkshire. He has a very nice house. The plaintiff's brother was also called to prove that he had taken the lodgings for his sister in London at the defendAnt's request. He had known of the engagement between his sister and the defendant. One of the medical gentlemen who attended the plaintiff durin.n her ilnes was caUed, and stated that she was suffering from a severe attack of dysentery. That would be caused by a bad state of the atmosphere. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case Mr. M. CHAMBERS addressed the jury onbehalf of the defendant. He admitted that the promise had been made, and had been broken, but under circumstances which would prevent the jury giving more than nominal damages. The defendant was a young man-only 21 years of age when the promise was made. Hie was sent to college by his father, and during the vacations he had fallen in love, as foolish youths 'Wll do, with the plaintiff, who was considerably older than himself. He had been induced to make the proposal, and then the plaintiff and her family had taken great care not to inform the defendant's father about it. Surely that was exceedingly improper conduct upon their part, and ought to be regarded by the jury in coming to a conclusion as to the amount of damages. As to the defendant's position, he had nothing at all, and whichever way the verdict went it was most probable he would be ruined. Under these circumstances he trusted that the amount of damages would be exceedingly small. Mr. Baron WAT802N, in summing up, said, that the only question for the jury would be the amount of damages They. must compensate the plaintiff for the loss she had sustained in not obtaining the settlement in life which the promise of the defendant had led her to expect. She ought also to have some compensation for the injury to her feelings. The only clue they had aste the position in life of the defendant was is wn tatmentto he laitif's father that he was in a position to get married. The ury afer shot cnsieraionof their verdict5 found for the plaintiff-damages 160/. "OFL .PXTON. Mr. Serjeant BallantinLe andMr Lewis were counsel for the pLaintiff; Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins for the defondant. The declaration in this case was upon two bills of exchage-one for LOOOI. and the other for 5001. The defendant pleaded infancey. Mr. EDWvIN JAMS, in opening the ecase, said, that he appeared for the defendant, and, the burden o ro en upon him, he had a right to begin The b of proof being 'were drawn by Mr. George Paxrton and acceped by Lord Ernest Vane Tempesit, and were endorsed by V ax.pton to tbe plaintiff. It would be provedtlxat at the time thebis were given the defendant was not of age, he hib nh been born on the 24th of November, 1836, and thrl,re behi would not attain his majority until November of this year. It was the duty of the defendant to defend this action, as be bad been tempted to draw bills to an extravagantlyX 1I anount to pay his brother officers' debts.

This was an adjourned certificate meeting. Mr. Lawrance ppPeared for the assignees, and Mr. Tiniklxter for tho bankrupt. Mr. Warner, merchant, of Threadneedle-street, a creditor for 3,2141,' deposed that he becamte acquainted with the basikrupt in the rear 1855, when the bankrupt was jintroduced to him by Messrs. Pelly and Boyle, brokers. In December, 1855, the bankcrupt told him that he was anxioust to purchase more goods, and which being of a class of which he was not a judge he would be glad if he would purohase for him. He offered to Day part cash, part bills, and to give references. After some time he put this question to the bankrupt :-" Thomas Ryder; are yoa a solvent man?' The bankrupt replied, " I am, and a am a prosperous man ' and he went on to say that his object was to increase his business, that he ha made excellent arrangements wth friends, and that he expected to do a large and prosperous business. After that he gave orders to various houses for goods. The bankrupt denied that he had made the above repre. sentations. He should consider it very nnpertinent to ask any merchant the question, ""Are you solvent? and nosuch question had been put to himself. On one occasion, aftes their transactions had commenced, Es. Warner had sad, "1Ryder, you must either be. a very wealthy man or a ver Iclever man," to which he responded that he never sailed auncder false colours, and that his knowledge wa3 all that he zelied upon. The bankrupt further deposed to the circumstanoes under which he had incurred losses to the amount of about 2004 by time bargains in Consols and Turldsh Scrip. He stated that his accounts commenced on the 1st of January, 1854, with a deficiency of nearl ,0001t, all his property at that time amounting only to 1 60 He had never been solvent, and no doubt he had gone on from bad to worse. is transactions during two years had amounted to 65,000. His unsecured debts were now 17,0001. There were alo liabilities 11,3M1., and 35,000&. owing to creditors holding recurity. There had been a loss of upwards of 9,0001. by chartering vessels. This loss had been occasionsd by the peace. The first announcement-vs., in asecond edition,of -he Times of the 17th of January, 1856-that the Russians had unconditionally accepted the propositions of the allies had determined him to sto. His practice was to buy goods and immedistely obtain adnces uon them. He didI not cal this pledgn. Some of the goods were bought on credit, which enabled him to make shipments as a merchant. His cash payments for goods were made by raising money upon goods bought. Mr. LwRAxcz submitted that the bankrupt's conduct had been purely that of a gambler-not less in goods than in his stock transactions. It would be a prostitution of words to call him a speculator. The assets were only about 1, 0001., or Is. in the pound, and the domiesticexnssi little more than two yers had been 2,1701. Thedeficiency on the 1st of January 1i84, was not a deficiency arising out of large transactions, but a deficiency arising out of nothig. Ee submitted that the certificate must be wholly refused, both-on the ground of the losses by Consols and s other conduct as a trader. TShe CoN3s1sIomm expressed a strong opinion that the bankrupt had brought himself within the 201st section of the bankrupt law by his losses upon Consols. Mr. Ia &Tz said, that in a similar case, where a bankrupt had incurred losses by time bargains in Peruvianx Stock, Mr. Commissioner Evans had held that the offence was neot within the 201 st section. His Honour would be the first Commissioner of that court, indeed, the firt judge in any court, who had taken this view of the statute. The words "wagerin; or gaming" peculiarly applied to such a kind of vice as dice or cards; but he scarcely thoueght that the Court would hold that they applied to losses by Consols or Turkish Scrip. His Hoxoup. said as his judgment might be of serious consequenoe to the tnekrupt, he would take a little time to l oo into the matter before giving his decision. Judgment deferred accordingly.

IN RE 33AIBuIDGO AND DEM. The bankrnpe were boot and shoemakezs in Southwark'bridge-road. This was an adjourned examination meetin The binkrupt Bainbridge, examined deposed to. Deli having filed accounts during his (Baintridge's) absence in !America, showing that he had had, prior to his departure, moneys amounting to 1,200L. On hfis return Dell iad endeavoured to persuade him to again absent himself. Dell had kept him drunk, but not more than a day " right off." 'He had the run of the tap, ancl so hadDel (A laugh.) Del had admitted that charging him with. 1,001. was false; and afterwards, when alluding to his balancesheet and money matters, had said:-" Fay? You ought to pay me, considering the toil and sleepless nights I have iha topreparo those 40 sheets of_ lies." De had been accustomed to shake up a few sovereigns in his pocket, and he (BaTnbridge) was drugged while travelling about the !country, prior to his departure for America. Another witness (Mr. Diossy) deposed to Dell having given a clerk of his, one Jones, 101. to settle the matter 'with him. His reply was, that he was determined to see rascality punished, and that he (Jones) might go with the money and be hanged. After a few words from Mr. A. Tum,,m for the assignee, .Mr. LAWlAuxc for Dell, and Mfr. B>BD for Bain. :bridge, iHis Homun ordered another adjournment. (Before Mr. Comminer PAN&) IN RE WHIET AND BATETE7ST.

I'SOLYBZT DEBTORS' COURT, Apra 24. = RV. 7."TWATn (Before H-r- V.- IL This insolvent,vwho had been a carrier, from Wakering, in Essex, to London, applied to be dischrged. Mr. Sargood opposed for a creditor named Hoard, and Wr. Dowse supported.tonaeHwrd a The opposing creditor is a grocer at Prittlewell, near Southend, who in Bebruary last year intrusted the insolvent with money, amounting to about 131., to make certain purchsses for him iD london. The insolvent upon his return to Prittlewell appeared with his arm in a img, and told au extraordinary story haout having been stopped at midnight by four men, vho robbed him of 27g., including the money of MIr. Howard. he further alleged that in the struggle he had been knocked down, and the wheel of his cart had gone over his arm. The matter was inquired into by the police, and the insolvent at first manifested a reluctance to have his arm examined by a surgeon, but eventually an examination was made by a Mr. Baker, who could find no bruise, and gave it as his opinion that if the wheel of the cart had gone over the part pointed out by the insolvent it would inevitably have broken thecollarbone. Mr. Coulson, the superintendent of the district police, was examined to-day, and stated that after inquiring into the insolvent's sto-y he did not think it prudent to arrest any one for the alleged robbery. Mr. Howard, beihevinu that the whole tale was an invention, sued the insolvent in the Rochford County Court to recover the money he had intrusted to him, and obtained a judgment for the whole amount, the learned judge evidenoing his opinion by committongthe insolvent to prison for 40 days, and subsequently for 31 davs in default of payment. The insolvent thed came to London, and in two ortlree days afterowards was arrested, as WaS alieged y a friend, to enable him to pass through this court and obtain relief from his debts. U3pon the part of the opposing creditor it was submitted that the proceeding was collusive and intended toa defeat the County Court whioh had ordered- pyment of the debt by instalments, as Mr. Ho rard was willmng to receive it. A abatement in the sohedule, that a distress had been levied upon the insolvent's goods, was shown to he ase, adwan affidavit was prcduced proving that no distress h;d taken Mr. Commnissione3: MURPY said, he could come to no othez conclusion thin that which had been arrived a by al .who had prevnously inquired into the matter. re did not believe the insclvent's story, 3and thought it had been con cocoted in-order to defraud Mr. Howrard.

Mr. MACRAE applied in this case for tho proceeds of cer tain property to be paid out of court.

MAMI.BOROUGEH.nTT.-Captain Joseph Erai, holding a commisidon id the Militia, and resading at No. 54, Queen's-road, Baygwater, was charged with the abduction of Rose Goodman, a girl under 16 years of age. Mr. Morgan was for the defendant; Mr. Lewis, of Ely. place, for the coinlainant. The charge was Iii under the 9th of George IV., cap. 31, sec. 22, wich provides,-" Beit enacted that if any person shall unlawfully take or cause to be taken any unmarzied girl being unner the age of 16 years out of the possesion and against t-he ll of her father or mother, or of any other person having the lawful care or charge of her every such offender shall be guiltyof a misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof, shal be liable to suffer such punish-. menthb, fine or imprisonment, or by both, as the Court shal Mr. Lewis tated the case, from which It appeared that the prisoner formed an acquaintance with the girl, then livng with her parentsa I london, and that he induced her to leave England under promise of making her his wife, although be was a married man, that, afte remainir g on the continent for several weelks, he left the girl at an hotel st Mayence ; that the girl wrote home to her parents, and the father telegraphed back to the landlord to have his d aughterdetained; and that theprisonerreturnedtothehotel, paid the bill, took the girl awzy to Ostnd, and there gave her up o her father, who threatened to give the prisoner Into cush-Av for abduction the first time he saw him in England. the prisoner was seen in London the prevfous evening, and was given into custody. Rose G nodmmn, duglxter of the well-known sporting character known as "Goody Levy," a well-grown, attractive Jewish girl, was then put into the witness-box and sworn. She sai,-I am livingwith my father at 31, Oxendon-street, flaymarket. I was 16 lears of age last October. In the month of July last I was residing in the New-road, Hazam mermnith. My mother was then alive, and my cousin was staying with me. Iwas outwalking oneday when I made tho acquaintance of the prisoner, who gave me his card, which I ssow6d to my father, and he tore it up and was angry. The prisoner was then lodging near the barracks. In conseueuneo of something that transpired I was removed to B tonand mymother oeo=mpueame,but as she was very unwell, she was unable to walk out with me. I saw the prisoner at Brihton, mnd I walked out with him several times without the knowledge of my mother. Before I left Brighton the prisoner asked me to marryhim. He did not say whether he was single or married, but ke said his mother wasa very religiou woman,andthat he could not marry me in England, for if he married without his motheres consent he should lose several hundreds a-year. He asked me my age, and I toldhim I was not then 16. I told the prisoner X would not leave England without being first married. I returned to London m August last, and went to reside at 31, Oxendon-street, with my parents. After I returned to London I met the defendant on two or three occasions, and the end of the interview 'was that I agreed to leave home with the defendant. I left my home on the 23d of August without the knowledge oi mv ,parents. Toinduceme toleavemyhomethedefendant said he was sure his mother would give her consent wnen she knew we were- married. On the afternoon of the 23d we went by railway, and afterwards crossed over to France. I met the defendant at the bottoom of the Hay. market, according-to previous appointment. Itook nothing with me but the clothes I had on. I left all my other clothes and my watch and chain at home. I remained with the defendant about six or seven weeks. I wrote severa letters to the defendant before we left England. Cross-examined by Mr. Morgan.-flad oorresponded with the defendant previous to his making proposals of marriage. Was not aware tlhe defendant was a married man. If I had known he was married I would not have kept up the acquaintance. I went away with him willingly. Mr. Morgan contended there was no evidence against the defendant. The complainant left her father's house voluntarily, and in the case of " the Queen v. Edwards," where a servant-girl had been induced to elope from service.Baron Parlke held that such a case did not constitute a charge of abduction. Mr. Morgan here read the case at length. 'Mr. Lewis contended that the case in question did not bear on that before the Court. The case quoted was that of a servant maid not in the, custody of her parents, and in which no fraudulent statements were made. The present case w4s that of a girl under 16, who was at home with her parents, and to whom a false statement was made to induce er to leave her father's protection. The prisoner was waiting for this girl, and he took her abroad with him. The Act m question-the 9th George IV.-contemplated a construetive as well as a physical taking away. It was meant to apply to the cases of girls under 16 on whom undue Influence was exercisod without the knowledge of their parents. Mr. B3rWGHa,r-You contend that this is a constrnutive ftaking away?7 Mr. Levis.-That ismyargument. Mlr.Morxgan said, his view of the Act was, that there must be a physical taking away, and in that opinion he was confirmed by the dictum of the learned Baron. Mr. B}NGsM.-That the child was taken out of the house arm-In-arm, or assisted out of the window,-that is the physical takng you mean, I presume ? Mir. Morgan.-There must be a physical talkng; there was no taking here according to the Act. The girl accompanied the defendant voluntarily. The mere decoy. ing or enticing away would not constitute a case under the 20thSection. Mr. BrtGEEAa.-I think there is a sufficient distinction between this case and that of " the Queen v. Edwards" to induce me to say that the charge must be settled by a higher tribal, ut have so much doubt about the matter that I shall admit the defendant to bail; I must have two sureties of 2501. and the defendant's recognizance in oOO., to appear next Thursday, The defendant was reported to have been in the Austrian service. WESrsvER.-Thomas Kelsall, alias Kruse, alias Sheppard, and William French, alias Johnson, two wellknown impostors, were brought up for re-examination, charged with impudent frauds. The prisoners owed their apprehension to an imposture gractised upon l. Dolloy, an aged lady, at Chelsea. In otober last Relsall went to her house, and repre. senting himslf as the son of 31r. Kruse, coal merchant, stated that a man in their employment having met with a terrible accident a subsecription was being raised to maintain his family and get him out of town, by which it was hoped that-his health would be perfectly restored. Mrs. Dorey gave5s., and Kelsal swent away. A few days ago he again visited the old lady, andintroducing French as the man for whom he had previously enlisted her sympathies, said that his nother in assisting him had parted wtth her last half. penyo, na-nad had a distress put in upon her goods, whi6h would .bo sold unless she eould raise 21. Ms. Doley referred the matter to her son, who, having made inquiries intO the prisoner's- story, gave the prisoners into custody, when they were remanded.- Thero was now a fresh cse exhibited against the prt: sor erPrenclh, or obtaining money fron Mrs. James Whatmdig, wie of the met nerof Parliament.

MIIEARBY AND IfA YIL MTELLIGECOX His Royal Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief till hold a levee at 1 o'leock on Tuesday noxt. - Extensive preparai .,ons have been made at Chatham Dock. yar for tho laur,ch of the large steam srew corvette 1taCoon, 22 .Ans, whieh will tako place this afternoon ihlortly after .t o'clock. The dockyard gates will be thrown open to tleo public at 12 o'clock, and, in order to accommo. date tlke officials and others cennected with the dockyard =6. garrison, a gallery has been erected near the bows of;the wvessel capable of containing a large number of spectators. The Rcoon has becn only about ten months building. Her extreme length is 229 feet 6 inches, and burden 1,462 tong. She hsm been oonstructed under the direction of Mr. Laire, the master shipwright. The Prinooss Charlotte, 104, three-decker, was ordered to be commissiOned yesterday at Portsmouth by Captain Charles St. Vincent King, C.B., for service on the China station. The Agamemnon, 91, screv, waa taken under the shears at Portsmouth yesterday and masted, and taken into dock again to be fitted for immediate cammission. The Sylph merchant steamer arrived at Portsmouth on Thursday from the Channel Isdands with 200 of the 72d Regiment, and sailed again the same evening for Guernsey, aud will bring over the remainder of the regiment. The Assistance screw steam troopship was commissioned at Portsmouth on Thursday by Mr. D. J. Louttid, Master, R.N., for Commander W. A. J. Heath, and the Adventure ECrew steamship was commissioned at the same time by Mr. George H. Stabb,l Master, R.N., for Commander Edward Lacey. These ships are to be rigged as barks, which is far better for them and much handier for their crew. Vice-Admiral Sir George F. Seymour, K.C.B., returned to Portstmouth on Thursday evening, and rehoisted his flag on board the Victory. The Sphinx, 6, paddle-wheel frigate, Commander A. P. E. Willmot, arrived at Spithead yesterday morning from the westward with a detachment of Royal Marines. She Is ordered to be paid off at Portsmouth, and placed in the second division a the steam reserve, for which purpose she went into har-testerday. In consequencd'f the strong wind and sea nothing could be done toward weighing the Coastguard cutter Curlew (which vessel was run down, as stated, by the steamvessel Baron Osy), except preparing the gear for raising her, which was being done when the Lizrd steamvessel left the African near the Curlew on Thursday evening. The screw gunboat Lively was taken into No. 4 dry dock yesterday at Sheerness for a general refit of her boilers, engines, &k., and for repairing her hull, The Admiralty have ordered that immediately the Vesanvins is ready to leave Sheernese' she is to proceed to Devon. port, where she wiU complete her crew of petty officers and able seamen. The Terrible is now in No. 1 dry dock, Sheerness, fitting for the pendant. The cylinders of the Terrible are 72 inches diameter, and she has worked up to 2.200 horse power. We stated in error her cylinders were 74 inches, and that she had worked up to 2, 000 horse power. The Emnperor new steam-yacht, destined as a present from Her Majesty to the Emperor of Japan, arrived at Sheerness on Thursday to have some alterations made in the officers' cabins and the mess berths of the crew, &c. She left yesterday at 3 p.m. for Portsmouth, where Lieutenant-Commnander John Ward (b) is expected to receive his final orders previous to his departure for Japan. The Emperor has a raised poop-deck the entire length of the saloon, wbich gives seven feet clear height from deck to beam. The saloon is entirely of maple wood; aU the fore part of the saloon is fitted with mirror panels, rich!y out and figured. On the floor is laid a richly painted oiled Canvas, over which is a magnificent Genoa velvet carpet. The curtains and coverings of the couches and chairs are of green satin, embroidered with gold. The tables are aU covered with green Genoa velvet; the bed cabins are superbly fitted with similar furniture; the bathroom is fitted completely in the Turkish style. The smoking chair for the Emperor is of unique manufacture. In the upper deck of the saloon is a magnificent and spacious skyligbt, adapted to be opened all round when necessary for extra ventilation. The following offleers proceed with her: -Lieutenant-Commander John Ward, Mate John DArcy Irvine, Assistant-Surgeon David Conrtney, and SecondMaster John F. R Aylon. She is fore and aft rigged, with three masts. Her engines alone, which are two 30 horse power condendng engines, propel her from eight to nine knots per hour in a seaway, In smooth water it is calculated she will attain from ten to twelve knots per hour. A very numerous meeting, composed of the clergy and most influential inhabitants of Woolwich and Plumstead, assembled yestorday evening in the Town-hall, Woolwich, for the purpose of devising and discussing the best means to assist the discharged artisans and labourers in their de-ire to emigrate to Canada. Lieutenant-General Sir W. Codrington oocupied the chair, and read a letter which he had addressed to Lord Panmure, together with the reply,informing him that his department had not the means of complying with his request in behalf of the men. Sir William then proposed the plan of raising subscriptions from the town and country at large with the endeavour to realize their project, and of urging the Government as a duty to contribute towards the fund. A number of gentlemen addressed the meeting with much energy on the subject, and Mr. George HallU Graham proposed an appeal to the Prime Minister himself, urging the justice of the men being treated with the same liberality as the German Legion, who, when their services were no longer required, were provided with homes and grants of land. The Rev. Mr. Ackworth remarked that as The Times, in a most considerate and pro. pitiatory leading article, had given publicity to their cause, they would speedily receivo abundant funds for their object, and if the country would only lend them a couple of ships the inhabitants of Woolwich and Plumstead would gladly furnish the stores. A number of resolutions were subsequently agreed to, appointing a committee, treasurer, and secretaries for coUecting the funds, headed by MajorGeneral Sir F. Williams, commandant of Woolwich garrison. Most of the gentlemen present entered their names for 5l. each, to which was finally annexed thename of the chairman for 251. Applause and acclamation greeted this an. nouncement, and the meeting separated. The screw steamship Doris, 32, recently launched at Pem broke, was towed on Thursday by the Confairnee and another steam-tug froui Plymouth Sound into aamoaze, preparatory to her going into Keyham-yard to receive her engines. In consequence of a merchant ship being at anchor in the Channel the Doris grounded for a short time on the Winter Shoal in the Sound. The steam sloop Fury, 6, Commander Charles T. Leckie, from Spithead, arrived at Plymouth on Thursday. The screw steamship James Watt, 91, Captain T. V. Anson, and the steam frigate Euryalus, 51, Captain George Ramsay, were paid off at Devonport on Thursday. The Boscawen, 70, flagsbip. will be paid off on Tuesday next In Thc 7Times of the 18th Inst. it was mentioned that Colonel W. T. Crawford, 13th Battalion, was appointed to the chief comroanid of the Royal Artillery in China. A correspondent requests us to state that Lieutenant-Colonel W. Crawford is much junior to Lieutenant-Colonel Danlop, and goes out, therefore, only as second in command, Lieutenant-Colonel RK Crawford, senior to Colonel Dunlop, is at the Cape of Good Hope. Colonel9Dunlop having given -complete satisfaction to his superiors, there was no idea that he should be superseded in the command of the artillery, although, of course, on so large a tody of troops being -ordered to China, it was necessary to send a General officer as Commander-in-Chief. The non-commissioned officers belonging to the 1st West India Regiment, stationed at the provisional battalion, Chatham, having completed a course of rifle instruction at the School of Musketry, Hythe, under Colonel C. C. Hay, hre left that garrison for the purpose of embarking at Southampmton to join the head-quarters of their regiment, to -hich they will act as i"structors in musketry, it being the intention of the authorities to arn the whole of the troops -of the West India Regiments with the Enfield rifle, The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Commander J. W. Dorville, to the Princess CharlotteLieutenant J. E. Doran, Lieutenant J. 0. CG Evered, and Lieutenant H. G. Belson, to the Prinoess Charlotte; David 'F. Nyor-an, sureon toth Astne aie 'Crtr m. aogan,surgors, to t e; Dsianiel CarteiCrte surgeon, to the Adventure. u G PK Deighton, paymaster, to -the Princes Charlotte; J. i.

T-Rl tXIDDEB:AIINSTRRP RfOT TO THC EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The cono:ding remarks in Mr. Chellingworth's letter of the %lst ;ist., appcaring in your paper of to-day, demand 6ome notice from me. How deeply MVr. Cbellingwsrth is implicated in the disgraceful proceedings of the !kNth of March is proved by depositions on oath ta3en before i be magistrates. His conduct during the actual infliction of injury upon Mr. Lowe and his friends, and bis subsequent expression of satisfaction at the result and probable c onsequenees of suoh injnry, as testified by the witness Bo% vyer, nmply justified, in fact demanded, that his conduct shon, id be made thesubject of inquiry. Tho magistrates have decided upon di tmisging his case, but it remains to be seen whether a jury will take the same view of the evidence against him; an d the fact of Mr. Chellingworth baving become bail for ti o apPearance of 14 of tho rioters carries with it its owvn weigt.t. One of the hiigliest legal opiaio s in England W' frst taken on the sufficiency of the evidence, which was given. to the following effect, "'That the evidence was siffic leAt to justify the magistrates in commilting all the defen 'auta (including Mr. Chellingworth) to the axsizes, and that it VAC the Justice's duty to do so." It oannot, theretore, in truth h asid that partyor politicaf feeling wvas tbe ,round of these proceedings. I am, Sir, gour obedient servant. ALFkED WALTER..

Tho increase on the Eastern Counties Railway amounted to 1,7361.; on the Great Northern, to 181f.; on the Great Western to 4,2371.; on the London and North-WesternAto 2,5781.; on the London and Blackwall, to 491. ; on the London, Brighton, and Soath Coast, to 2.956.; onthe London andSouth-Western, to 3201 ; and on the South-Eastern, to 2,0311.; total 14,0881. The receipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 255,2901., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 237,985., showing an increase of 17,3051. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 31,393. as compared with the corresponding week of 1856 Thefollowing are the recelpts of railways for the pst week - EAST INDIAN. The report of the directors states that " The East India Company hLa n agreed to raise the rate of guaranteed interest from to 5 per cent. on a further sum of 1,500,0001. of the capital, the board have been enabled to offer an allotment of new shares to the proprietors, in the proportion of one share for every 1001. consolidated stock, or one share for every five shares of their existing investments. This capital is isuned on precisely the same terms as former issues, and when fully paid up can be consolidated into stock. The board of directors regret that they have not received information to so late a date as they could have wished as to the state of the works on the division of the line from Caleutta to the river Kurumnassa. Mr. Evans, acting chief engineer in the Upper Provinces during the temporary absence of Mr. Purser, having recently inspected the works on the line from the river Euramnassa to Delhi, farmishes the board with particulars of the progress made to the 13th of February. rhe section from Calcutta to Raneuge, 121 miles in length, was opened for traffic on the q of February, 1855. The section from the junction near Bardwan to the north side of the river More, 45 miles, is being constructed by the Company's engineers, is in a forward state, and it is rroposed to open the line up to the river Hadjal, a length of 21 miles, in December next. The works from the river More to Colgong, with a branch to Rajmahal, about 134 miles, are in progress, 67 miles of which are being construoted by the Company's officers, and the other half by two contractors. From Colgong to Luckerseria, about 80 miles, the works are n ot so forward as they should be ; more energy is required on the part of the contractors. From Luckerseria to Phoolwarree, about 85 miles, the works were for some time in a disorganized state, bat an improvement has taken pace. From 1'hoolwarreeto the River KIurumnaqsa, about 80 miles, owing to a general failure in brick-making during the last season, favourable progress has not been maintained. The works to Mogulseria, about 50 miles, are proceeding with expedition; but the works from Benares to Allahabad about 95 miles, havenot advanced so steadily as was expected in April last. The works from Allahabad to Cawnpore, about 126 miles, are progressing satisfactorily. The rails are laid for a distance of 28 miles out of the Allahab station. The works in the Cavnpore district (26 miles), in the Etawah district 98 mils in the Agra district (66 :miles), and Delhi district (91.j miles) are being carned on by tbe company's officers. With reference to the nature of the works on the line from Allahabad to Delhi, and their present state, there seems to be no reason why, if it be proved practicable to get the permanent-wav materials up, the whole distance should not be opened by the end of 1858 and the board will give directions that every exertion be used to accomplish this object. Durng the year ending the 31st of December last 65,000 tons of permanent way inaterials and iron work for rolling stocok were shipped at favourable rates of freight, notwithstanding that there was a general scarcity of shipping. The number of passengers carried on the railway from Calcutta to Ranegunge between the 1st of July and the 31st of December, 1856, was 465,121, of which 6,639 were f3rtclass, 25,877 second-class, and 432,605 third-ela passengers -showing an increase in this branch of traffic over the halfyear endint June, 1856, of 32,800 passengers, and over the corresponding half-year in 1855 of 107,486 passengers. The tonnalge in goods and minerals for the half-year was 44,695 tons, showing an increase of 24,675 tons over the correspondinog period of 185. The traffic receipts for the year ending the 31st of December, 1856, amountedl to 95,1881., against 58.5871. for the year endin Dcmber, 1855; and in March last they had reacthed 300.pr week. The payments made to the East India C py out of net revenue, in diminution of their ad. Tances for interest, amountLted for the half-year ending the 80th of June, 1855, to 10,6311.; ending the 31st December, 1855. to 20,6211. ; and ending the 30th of June, 1856, to 27,7911. The board are much disappointed at being unable to publish the revenue accounts to the 31st of December last. The working expenses for the half -year ending the 80th of June, 1810, had been brought down to4O -56 per cent. of the receipts. The company's engineers are taking borin)gs ofthe river Sutlej, with a view to determaine the mnost eligible paint for crossing that river ; this will be the most important work on the line from Delhi to IAhore. Mr E. Palmer, late of the Great Western and Great Northern RAilUway Compauies, was appointedI agent, to succeed Sir R lMr. StephEenson at Calcutta. Messrs.'M. and G.

EQUALIZATIOi OF THE POOR.EATZ. TO THE EDITOR OB THE TMES. Sir,-It would, no doubt, contribute amazingly to the speedysettlementof thigquestion if a complete plan were definitively agreed upon and submitted to the captieus ob. jections of those whose interest it may be to dissect it aecundurjartem, and show a deadlock somewhere or other in the working of it. The subjectwould speedily be settled, but not to the satisfaction of tho public. I am not a member of "the Asociation for the Equaliza, tien of the Poor-rates," but I sympathize most cordially with their efforts in so good a cause, and promise them, thus publicly, my own help in it, and that of four-fifths of the incumbents of the East-end of London, many of whom are ready to lend their school-rooms at once for meetings of ratepayers to consider this question and appeal by petition to the Legislature. At the same time I would strongly advise the association not to decide at present upon any question of detail until the principle of equality both in rate and assessment be agreed to L by Parliament. The presa generaUy is in favour of this principle; your own-leader on Monday last has put the matter in so strong a light that nothing can be added to the convincing proofs there brought forward of the cruelty to the poor and injuatice to the ratepayers which the present system entails. Let then, public meetings of ratepayers be held in every quarter of the metropolis to impress upon the Government and the Legislature their opinions :-I that the rate must be made equal; and, 2, that it must be levied upon one uniform assessment. It matters but little what vehicle a doctor uses for the administration of his physic,-it may be cold water, or jam, or honey,-the kind of medicineand the quantity are the two important particulars; these are agreed to be for the metropolitan patient "an equalrate" and "anequal assessment ;n whether this be paid to and distributed by a general treasurer or a financial board elected by the unions is a matter of very little Consequence; it is not the medicine to cure the present disorder, but merely the vehicle in which it is exhibited. Mr. Butterworth, in his very sensible letter, publ shed in 2VioT 2imes to-day, fears that the system of local management will be disturbed by the proposed measure. Now, it has never been once suggested that the present local officials should be dispensed with, the present union-houses closed, and a total change made in the management of the poor. Such an alteration as this would meet with my strongest opposition. There is no necessity whatever for any such thing. The only change will be in the amount of rate eollected; the collectors may be and ought to be the same. The Poor Law Board might settle, from the average expense of the last three years, what would be required for the next year; a sufficient rate might be laid over the whole tf London, on the property-tax assessment, to meet that amount, and the several unions might draw upon the treasurer appointed by the board for the money they severally required, subject, of course, to the approval of the auditors an the periodical visits of the Government inspectors. This proposition might be submitted to a committee of the House of Commons, who would soon, by the evidence of thoee best qualified to judge of such a matter, arrive at a right conclusion. The value of property will not be much altered, except in tcose parishes where the rate is now exorbitantly high. The total rate, if equalized, would not be 5 per cent, on the property of any one parish in London in addition to its present rate. The differencewill not be the difference between as. 7.d. in the pound, but the difference between 74 (the loweIt rating now) and the equalized rate- i. , about Is. 3d. in the pound. The property-tax value of the eight unions which are the most distressed and heavilv rated under the present system-namely, Bethnal-green, Fulham, St. George's-iu-the-East, St. George's, Southwark, Rotherhithe, Shoreditch, Skpney, and Whitechapel -is about 1,550,000L per annum, an amount absolutely less than the value of the two unions of St. George's, Hanover-square, and Paddington-the only two unions, except St. James's, Westminster, that will lose by the arrangement, but which can both w6ll afford an increased rate on the 71d. which they now pay. The property in these rich parishes will be burdened with about 3 per cent. per annum of additional poor-rate; and wvhy should they not!? They will not have to pawn their goods to pay the collector, nor yet to starve their poor, ,x5 the ratepayers and guarmians of some unions are nowv compelled to do. But, besides the oppression of the poor and the injustice to the ratepayer, there is another element worthy of a passing remark. The charities of the rich parishes and the clergy ministering in them can obtain assistance whenever they like to ask for it, while those of tho poorer districts are altogether unable to obtain the help they need. The West-end incumbent has often more money placed at his disposal for his poor than he knows how to spend; his Eastend brother, with a much smaller income, is com peled to relieve hispoorand keep his charities solvent out of his own pocket. Where the rates are high the subscriptions to local charities are low,-that is, wvhere a charity is moit wanted there it is least supported, a nd vibe wi-sd, This ought I believe, with 3fr. Butterworth, that the equalization of the poor-rate waill settle the settlement question, and it is high time it were settled, That alone wvould be a vast boon to the ratepayer and the rate-receiver. Fearing to trespass further at present on your valuable apace, I am, Sir, yours. &c. AN EAST-END INOUMBRNI2 I uwu rxa arsoanage, it. George's-in-the-est.
THE CAPITAL OF CANAD4. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A few words on tho question of the Canadian rent of Government may not be unacceptablefrom one who is in. timately acquainted with that province, and who yet has no personal stake in either of the places whose claims to a elction have been lately discussed in your columns. It must not be forgotten that Canada is French as well as English, andinthat the settlement of eoimportanta question Justice and policy aike deannd that the interests and predilections of both races should be consulted to as great an extent as possible. Toronto, ingston, Bytown (or Ottawa city), Montreal, and Quebec are the places which have been put forward as candidates for the honour of selection. Of these Toronto is altogether English, and is far removed from the French section of the Province. It is a magnificent and rapidly-growing colonial city, and requires no such adjunct as the presence of the Government to add to its importance. Kingston is likewise En-'lish. The nature of the surrounding country is such as to render it improbable it will ever rival Toronto in importance. Both of these last-named places are Cut off from the sea by rapids, which, in time of peace, the St. Lawrence canals enablevesselscomting frombelow to turn. But in the eventof war with the United States these canals could not be depended on for a day. They run close and paraUel to the St. Lawrence river, and a few pounsof powder judiciously exploded on a dark night for the destruction of one lock by an enterprising Yankee who might cross from his own shore in a few minutes would effectualy bar the progress of vessels proceeding unwards to the lakes; and the only means of a pproaching ^ingston and Toronto would in such a case be by the circuitous and tediout3 ronte of the Rideau Canal. Tbis ought to be a decisive objection to the location of the aeat of Government at either of those places. Besides that, they are both exposed toa^ coupdde-main from the American We next come to Bytown, which owes its existence to the construction of the Rideau Canal, and derives its andoubtedly flourishing condition from the traffic of that canal, at the Ottawa terminus of which it is situated. Like Toronto amd 'Kingston, it is cut off from the sea by two rapids, which are turned bv shortcanaL, the locks of which, however, are of such capacfty as to admit but vessels of very small dimensions. Bytown, a place of very recent foundation, cannot number more than a few thousand inhabitants (the precise number I am unacquainted with), and I am amnazed that any peron should scriously advocate its selection as the capital of Canada, although I can understand that such a choice would be extrerrely agreeable to those vho possess property in the neighbourhood. One hundred years hence, if t e kaleidoscopic visions of its supporters as to its future grk atnews be realized, it is possible that another Legislature may consider the propriety of removing the seat of Government to that favoured spot. But for the present it is probable that it will be permitted to develope its resources unaided or unimpeded by the political struggles and bickerings which are inseparble from the locus of a colonial Legislature. Montreal, a city of 50,000 inhabitants, is situated at the foot of the river, and at the head of the ocean navigation of the St. Lawrence. The French and English elements are there more equally blended than in any other place. The French preponderate ian numbers, the English in wealth. Its situation renders Montreal inaccessible to any sudden hostile attempt, and it might easily be secured absolutely against any deliberate attack. Quebec is almost exclusively French, and too far removed from Upper Canada, and in this point of view would be objectionable, although, f-om its magnificent situation and bistoric interest, otherwise well fitted to be the capital city f this great Anglo-French community. Indeed, its claims o be the capital of the Viceroyalty of British North Ame. ifa, should the vision of a confederation of the provinoes b-e realized, would in that case be mnrivalled. But, as the capital of Canada proper, I believe it must be 'onceded that Montreal is the place the selection of which is likely to combine the smallest amount of dissatisfaction with he greatest amount of advantage. It is the centro of a network of railroads which, passing through aU the chief towns, connects it with the extremities of the province aB well as with Portland, Boston, and New York- Only 13 years have elapsed since the people of United Canada themnelves selected Montreal as their capital, dusing which period its 2 elative advantages have certainly not diminisbed. At the time of the "Rebellion Losses" disturbance the coalition of Toronto and Quebec interests in the Legislature established the absurd osellation of the seat of Government between those places. Then, as now, Bytown had its advocates, and, if I reLueznber right#y, the number of voices raised inits favour1in thie Provincial Parliament wras two I I am.
