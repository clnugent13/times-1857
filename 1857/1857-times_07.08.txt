Vest numbers (frequently uipwards of 3tO) are here daily relieved with advice and medicine, and the meet urgeut anuI distressing cases admitted Into the wards as far an the funds from time to time at the disposal of the Committee will permit. Durwig the last year 44.217 were relieved; and sirce the foundation of the Hospital in 1828. up to 3lst December, 1856, considerably mote than half-a-dmion dise3sed poor have receive4 asMistance. The recent addition of the Sussex Memorial Wing not only affords preater facillty in admiDistering rellef to applicants, but also an opportunity of Increasing the number of in-patients.

I wao not permitted to attend before the CoDmmittee towbom my bIll of costs was referred. so that I migbtimupsori my own charges as in usual and customary to all such caves : I waa denied a reference to any respectable solicitor, anpd I was even not allowed the satisfaction of having my charges a,serseed by one of the Taxing Masters; and when, fer the Purpoe of avoiding litigation, and the naesesty of resigning my Solicitership to youir Sank, in the formation of which I had taken such a prominent an.A res: onsibVe phrt I agred to accept a redured amount, amd gave a receipt in fultwal,~ mowtstnig dragged before the shareholders anti the publicby Mir.

Roebuck reading a letter commencing, as he, stated, ' We. the promoters," I have since ascertained that there Is no lett,r commencing "1We, the promoters," The letter was one of indemnity only, aild it he had commenced it correcetly he maust hsav read the whole letter and the Mleeting would then have been enlab!ed, from Its contents, to forms c orrect judgment, I sepeat that I was rot a promoter, and that I did not participate In the Promotion money. Shortly after the MeetiUng of the shareholder In Mlay last I Was in. formed that the mn-ne,a eo borrowedfrom the Ban of Lo.donhad been repaid by mnoneys advnoned to some of your Directors for that urseby their own SctaD, the Westemn Bank of London, and that this lua had been pard off previoustly to the audit by one of your Dire3Ltore, and that cerUtilate of the shaves so paid upon had been handed over to him by the M~mager, witbout the authority either Of the Board or of the allottees, and that such allottees haid not, even sftar thellasao Of nearlyll months, teen e-mmnricated with, as to the paymentwhich had been made ontheir behalf. This appeared to mesoirregular and to have placed the B.iuk in so dangerous a position, that 1 ImmedIately waited on the Maniager and remonstrated with him on the subject, but my remonstranuce was of no avail- he told me that the Direc. tore were well advlaoe. I then, on the 20th of May last, wrote to each of thej Directors a private and confidenitia letter, calling their attention to the poaltion of the faank. On the 2d J unelI a-tte ided the Board of Directors inobedieTnceto the summonus of their Se 7etwry, anti as legal adviser to the Bank I gave MY opinion, which waa repodiated by the Board, I thereupon reQuested that a statement of the facts anid of my&opno which I had reduced into writing, should be entered on their utes and I begged thata& rce might be laid before some counsel of emninence. NO concluslon was arrived at by the Board in my reneco nor did the Directors make any communicationk to me, anldy =erIg the oonse. quences of delay, I deemed It prudent to obtain the confidential advice of Mfr. Hugh Hill and NMr. Cleasby, two gentlemen of the highest cha-. racter and standing at the Commnon-Law Bar, and on the 0ith June X laid before tbem s,car~e and havlng obtained their opinion, which folly coincided with that giVen by mee to the Directors, I immediately torwarded a oyo tecs and opinon to Air.

THE GLASGOW_POISONING CASE. TRIAL OF MISS MADELEINE SMITH. MONDAY, JULY 6- SIXTH DAY. Tne High Court met this morning at 10 oclock to proceed with the trial of Miss Madeleine Smith for murder. The JUDGES first gave their opinion as to the receptionI of the deceased's diary or memorandum-book, the entries in which were made opposite the dates February 11 to March 14, and one or two of which were offered in proof of the first and second, charges of the indictment. Its admisibility raised a question entirely new, and their Lordships differed in opinion. The Lord Justice Clerk and Lord Handyside were of opinion that it would be highly dangerous to receive as evidence a writing which might have been idle and purposeless, or might have been a record of unfounded auspicions and malicious charges, which was only meant for the eye of the writer, and was subject to no test by which the seriousness ortruth of the statements therein made could be asoertained. Lord Ivory, on the other hand, considered that the evidenco should be admitted quantum vaaeat. The evidence was rejected in accordance with the opinion of th majority of the Court. The following letter, No. 79 of inventory for the Crown, was put in as evidence by the Lord Advocate :- "If P. and MI go, wfl 1you not, gweet love. como to your Wid? Do you thb= I wouId ask 3 ou if I ,saw danger l tehone? No, love, rwuldnot. lI shall let youn no cne sha see rou. we can mrake it ateIl.Ifyou~~lase Yu hve o lngwalk. No. may own beloved.

I need not wih you a merry Chrtu bbutI shallwish thatX weo may spend the next toetther, aud that we Mrs. Janet Anderson was examined to prove that at a party at Mrs. Wilkie's on the 5th of February the prisoner denied that the necklace she had on was giveon her by Mr. Minnoeb, and said it was given her by her papa. This closed the evidence for the Crown. lEXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. The DFTx of FACULTY said that reference would necessarily be made to affairs of a delicate nature in which the deceased had been engaged at an earlier pernod of his life aud he was anxious to avoid names being mentioned unnecessatily ; and he had no doubt his learned friend on the other side would assist him in doing so. Robert Baker, grocer, St. Heliers, Jersey.-I lived at Edinburgh in 1851-52, and acted as waiter in the Rainbow Tavern. When there I was acquainted with Emile L'Angelier. Be lived in the Rainbow between six and nine months, so. far as I can recollect. He lived there until The time he went to Dundee. We. slept together. The tavern was then kept by Mr. G. Baker, an unde of mine. L'Angelier was then in a very destitute state, living in fact on my uncle's bounty. He was waiting till he could hear of a situation. I took him for a quiet sort of a person, bat he was very easily excited. He was at times subject to low spirits. Latterly he told, me on more than one occasion. he was tired of his existence, and he eometimes spoke of suicide. On one occasion he got up in the night, and opened the window. I got up and asked bim what he was doing, and he said if I had not disturbed him he would have thrown himself out. The windows are about six stories from the ground. Be was very often in the habit of getting up during the night, walking about the room, and weeping. I was aware he had met with disappointment in a love matter, but he did not mention it to me. It was my uncle who told me of it. I have heard him talk abont it to othes. It was some lady in Fife. Re was distressed he had no situation, and that he could not keep his engagement with her. We were in the habit of taking morning walks together. We occasionally walked to Loith pier. He one morning told me he had a good mind to throw himself over, as he as quite tired of bis existence. I have heard him read of newspaper cases of suicide, and he would say this person had done what he should do if he had the same courage. Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCAMT-L'Angelier was a Jersey man, and I had met him there some time about 1846. Re-examined and shown No. 1, first inventorv for Prisoner.-Thatis a letter from him to me, written in Dndee. (In that letter he'says, after saying he had just landed in Dundee and had got a situation in which he was working for board and lodging only, and with ahnost no salary:-" I never was so unhappy in my life. I wish I had courage to blow my brains out. ') William Pringle Laird. nurseryman, of Dundee.-Iwas acquainted with the late Emil LAngelier. I knewhimn when in the service of Dickson and Co. in Edimn h, in 1843. I took him into nuy own employment in 1852. He had been In France for some time in the interval. He came to me on OldlHandsel Mondayof 1852 (26thof January). Heremained till the end of August or the ist of September. He was a veryr ober young man, kind and obliging, but excitable and changeable in his temperament-sometimes very melancholy, and sometimes very blithesome. He was very dull and unwell when he first came to me. He did not tell me the cause at first, but he shortly afterwards told me of a cross in love he had got. He told me it was reported the lady was to be married to another, but that he scarcely believed it, as he did not think she could take another, because (as I understood him to say) she was pledged to him. He told me who she was. I believe she was in the middle station of life. After this ] saw the lady's marriage in the newspapers. L'Angelier saw the notice of the marriage. William Pringle, my cousin, was my apprentice at the time. Se, or some other one, told me of something L'Angelier had done, which led me to speak to him. I told him I was sorry to see him so sad, and was still more sorry to hear be had taken up a knife to stab himself. He said very little. I said what I could to soothe him; but he said he was truly miserable, and he wished he was out of this world, or something to that effect. Be was in a very melancholy state after this. He was gloomy and moody, and never spoke to any one. I had frequent conversations with him. He attended church regularly and was a very moral lad, but he did not show anything particularly religious about him. He sometimes went to church with me, and sometimes to the English chapeL He often told me of being in France, and of being in Paris during the Revolution of 1848. He told me he was onaged in it. He told me he was a member of the National (Juard. He was rather a vain man. He came to me as an extra hand. He offered to come for bed and board, and 8L or 10s. a-week, and he got that. William Pringle, nephew to last witness, and for some time his apprentice.-I slept with the deoeased, and had frequent conversations with him. I told him I had heard of a marriage being m the newspapers-that such a lady had been married. He seemed much agitated, and he ran once or twice behind the counter, and then he took hold of the counter knife and held it as if to stab himseLf. I stepned forward and he put it down again. I don's remember what he said. He was particularly melancholy after this, and I felt a little afraid he might do himself some mischief. Andrew Watson Smith.-I am an upholsterer in Dundee, and was acquainted with L'Angelier. I was then lving at Newport, opposite the Tay. He was in the habit of coming to see me there. We slept together when he came. I thought him a very excitable sort of character; he was often in very high spirits and often in very low. He told me of a disappointment in love he had had- that he had been engaged to a lady for a number of years, that the match had been broken off, and that he frequently felt inclined to destroy himself. He showed me a rmig he had got from the lady. I think her name was engraved on it. He sometimes spoke about drowning himself, and said that he could never be happy again. I have a faint remembrance that he said he had once gone to the Dean-bridge, in Edinburgh, to throw himself over, because this lady had jilted him. He did not say what bad hindered him. Self-destruction was a very frequent subject of conversation with him. He appeared to be serious when he spoke of it, but I did not seriouly apprehend that he would do it. I did not think he had the courage, It was in his low moods he spoke about suicide. He told me about having been in France at the time of the Revolution, and that he had felt veryvnervous after leaving there, which he attributed to the excitement. He said he thought he frequently heard a noise bebind him as of a number of rats running along. When he spoke about the lady who had jilted him he was always very excited, and once I remember his crying, as if in great grief. When he talked of destroying himself, it was bv means of drowning that he threatened to do so. Willim Andersqon.-I had a nursery and seed shop in Dundee in1852. I became acquainted with Emile L'Angelier while he was in Mr. Laird's ship. I had occasional conversasmuns v *i himn. Be seemed of a sanguine and excitable disi n !,his conversation was that of a vain person. *er the subiect of conversation he soke much -n aud boasted of his suoess with then. Once uiwn ' ouse, when the conversation turned that way, L. me he was very intimate with two ladies in Dundee, aud that it seemed to him his attachment was returned; that they were very beautiful girls, and worth a considerable sum of money. I understood him to mean, not that anything improper had occurred-that he loved them, and they loved him in return. I did not take this to be bragging merely; he seemed in earnest. I remember he said he did not know very well what he would do if he was jilted by any ladr, but ho would have revenge upon her in one shape or another. Be was occasionally irritable in his disposition. He had more of a French, Spanish, or Italian than aus Jiughab temperannent,- William Ugilvie, assistant tellor in Dundee Bank.-In 1852 I was secretary to the Floral and Horticultural Society in Dmndee, and the meetiigs were sometimes held in dr. Laird'B hack shop. In this way I became acquainted with lAmngelier. He was very variable in his spirits, remarkably so. His conversatioa wac generaUly about ladies. Ee sometimes seemed vain of his success with them. He talked about the ladies looking at him as he passed alorg the street, and boasted of considerablesucoessin obtainin5 the acquaintance of ladies. On one occa-ion in Mr. LAird s shop, while speaking of his sweethearts, he said, if he got a disappointment, he vould (taking up a long inife) think nothing of putting that into him. He was not speaking of any real case, but generally. The idea seemed somewhat to excite him. He has spoken to me about travelling in France. He led me to understand he had been travelling in that country at one time with some persons of distinction; and had charge of all their baggage. carriages. horses, &o. Hle mentioned that the horses were very much knocked up with some long journey, and that he had given iem arsenic to recruit them. At that time I was not acqnainted with the effects of arsenic in that way, and I asked what effect it hid'? He told me he had given it in order to enable them to accomplish the journey better. He said it made them long-winded, and thus he was enabled to accomplish a feat. I asked, was he not afraid of poisoning the horses? And in reply to that he said, "So far from that I have taken it myself." I told him I sbould not like to follow the same example, but he used some expression to the effect that there was no danger. HIe said another effect of it was that it improved the complexion. I inferred that he took it himself for that purpose, but he did not say so in so many words. He also said he sometimes complained of pain in his back and hal difficulty in breathing, and that he had taken iG. and it had a good effect in relieving him. I Gnmi, he once shorwed me scmething white iu a paper, and said it Ws arsenic. He either showed it to mo or said he had it. I have seen him several times taking poppy seeds in pretty large quantities. I expressed on one of these occasions my surprise, as I understood they were poisonous; and he said. so far from that he could take them in large quantities, and that they were better then filberts or nuts. Ho said he bad taken these poppy seeds in great quantities, till he had be-come quite giddy. He said he haa done so when he was at Dickson s, in Eainburgh. Cross-examined.-I became acquainted with him in 1S52. He never told me he had been jilted. I did hear of that, bat not from him. We had just one conversation about arsenic. He did not say in what shape or quantity he took it. The reason I thought poppy seeds dangerous was that opium i extracted from them. By the Coumt.-I cannot say whether he gave the horses arsenic on one occasion, or tbroughont the journey, bat I think it was on one occasion. I knew he' was a foreigner, but he spoke remarkably good English. I only once heard him speak Ftench. I am quite certain it was arsenic he spoke of giving the horses. He spoke in English. David lilL-I am a market gardener in Dandee, and was in Mr. leird's employment in 1852. I recollect one day finding a small parcel in a wood north of Dundee which I thought was arsenic. I brought it to Dundee, and was told it was arsenic. This was before L'Angelier came to Dundee, bat I told him of the circumstance afterwards, and be said, "Oh. that was nothing strange, as he used it regularly." He did not tell me for what purpose he used it. I havebeen tying to remember, but I canzot now do so. Oross-xamined.-I have been tryin to remember since I have been asked about this affair. I told it first to Mr. ALird, my late master, and Captain Miller of Glasgow came to me. He was the superintendent of police at Glagow, and he is now a messenger-at.arms. No one was with me vhen I spoke to L'Angelier about this. We were passinM along the top of Union-street. No one heard what passed between us. He said he us4ed it regularly. I did not inquire, and he did not say in what way. Edward Mackie.-I am a merchant in Dublin. I was in the habit of visiting Edinburgh in the course of my business. I occasionally visited the Rainbow. I got acquainted with L'Angelier there. I was intimately acquainted with Mr Baker, who kept the tavern. I first became acquainted with L'A.ngelier in 1846; and I continued to see him at the Rainbow until a day or so previous to his going to Dundee. I had several conversations with him. I saw quite enough of him to enable me to form an opinion of his character and disposition. I formed anything but a good opinion of him. I considered him a vain, lsing fellow. He was very boastful of his personal appearance, and of parties admiring him-ldes particularly. He boasted of his high acquaintances repeatedly, and the high society he had moved i; that was when he returned from the continent, whcen he became more or less of a man; he was quite a lad when I first saw him. He mentioned eeveral titled people whom uae had known, but, not believing anything e was saying at the time, I did not store up any of their titles Shortly before he went to Dundee I met him one evening in Prinoe'-street Gardens, Edinburgh. He was sitting in the garden; I came on him accidentally- he had his head in his cambric pockethandkerchif, and I put my hand on him and said, "L'Angelier." He held up his head, and I perceivedhe had been crying; his eyes had the appearance of much weeping. He mentioned that a lady in Fifeshire had lighted him; butI made light of the matter. He made a long complaint about her faraily ; he was much excited. He said ladies admired him very often. I remember on one occasion particularly he came in when I was reading the papers in the Rainbow; he told me he met a lady in Princes'-street with another lady, and she had remarkei what pretty little feet he had. I had said he w:s a rather pretty little person, and I had no doubt he hal gone out and concocted the story that she had said she admired his feet, they were so pretty. I never believed anything he said afterwards. It was a common thing for him to speak of ladies admiring him in the street. Cross-examined.-I live in Dublin. I have a country house in Dublin, at the Lower Quay. To a certain extent I believed the story about the Fife lady. I believed there was a lady there, and that he was after her, for I had seen him weep0 about her. Miss Janet Christie.-Some years ago I was acquainted with Mrs. Craig, St. George's-road, Glasgow. She bad a son in Huggins and Co.'s. I occasionally met L'Angelier at her house. I recollect hearing him say that the French ladies used arsenic to improve their complexion. This might be about four years ago. Crogs-xamined.-I cannot recollect where this conversation occurred, or who was present at the time. By the COUsT.-I thought him rather a forward and pretenoionS young man. Alexander Mllxr.-I am in the employment of Huggins and Co., and knew L'Angelher. I remember his telling me ie was going to be married. He told me first about nine months before his death. He fixed different dates. These dates passed; but in February he told me he was really to bemaied. I gave it little credit. He gave me to understand he would be married in about two months. He told me cn that occasion who the lady was. He was very sensitive: ekssly depressed, and as easily uplifted. On one occasion he said he wisbed he was dead. He has spoken to me about people taling theirown lives. Ho gaid he did not consider there Was any gin in a person taking away his life to get out of the world when tired of it, and having lost all happiness in it. I objected to this, and said our life was not our own; but he did not acknowledge having abandoned his opinion. When he said he wished he was dead I wasgoing to remonstrate with him, but some one came in. Ihad began to tell him hoas talking nonsense. HE seemed serious in his conversation. He complained several times of having had diarrhcea, an4 about the middle of February he complained of having had pain in the bowels. He had on several occasions complained of diarrhoea before tbat. Almost since I knew him he complained of it, but latterly he complainod more frequently. He appeared to receive a great many letters. He had several other female correspondents besides Miss Smith. Cross-examined.-Wo had the impression in the ofdice that he was a young man of regular habits and a worthy young man Agnes WAlillan.-I was at one time in Mr. Smith's service as table-maid. I was there about a year. It is three years last May since I left. Miss Smith was at home at that time. Miss Elizabeth left home to go to school near London. I remember on one occasion Miss Smith said something about arsenic-that she belaved it was used for the complexiOn, Or that it was good for it. I do not remember anything else., James Girdwood.-I am a surgeon in Falkirk, aud have been in practice about 40 years. I have been frequently asked by ladies as to the safety of using arsenic as a cosmetic, since the publcation of an article in C(hamber-s's .Tounwui about two years ago. Cross-examined.-I was asked on the subject by a good man of my friends. The opinion I gave them was that it wou?d be highly injnrions. John IRoberton.-Iam a druggist in Queen-street, Glasgow. I remember an application being made in my shop for arsenic by a man servant. Thiswas in the beginningof last May. The young man was from 17 to 19 years of age, and he asked ror a 6d. worth or Is worth of arsenic. I asked him for what purpose it was to be used. He said it was for a lady who was waiting outside, and that she was going to use it for the complexion. I did not give it. I did not ask the servant's name, I did not see any lady waiting outside. Peter Gutbrie.-I am the manager of Fraser and Grieve's shop in Sauchiehall-street. We seU arsenic. I remember a lady coming in the beginning of last year and asking me about arsenic. She produced a number of Blck. wooc's Magacinic, containing an article about the use of arsenic for the complexion. Sheasked me for some of it, but I refused it. She expressed a strong desire to have it, butI would not give itto laer. Cross-exainned.-I did not know tho lady, but I had seea her before. William Roberts, merchant, Glasgow,-I became acquainted with the deceased about 1853. He dined with me on Christmas-day of l853. It was on a Sunday. After dinner he became vey iU. When the ladies retired he got up to leave the room. I showed him the water-closet and returned to the dining-room. I sat a consideral;e time and wondered what kept him. I opened the dining-room door and heard groaning and vomiting. I went to the closet ar,d found him vomiting and purging. I sent upstairs for cholera mixture, and I think he got a good deal of it. Cholera had been lately in town, and we got very much frightened. After this he remained in the water-closet a considerable time, and he was afterwards taken home in a cab. He appeared to get better, for he caUed on me next day, or the one followin.' to apologize for having become ill. I think he was fuUy al hour absent before I went out to seek for him. Cross-examined.-At that time I thought him a nice little ellow. He sat in chapel with me for three years. I had occasion to change my opinion of him, but not from anything within my own knowledge. . Charles Baird.-I am a son of Robert Baird, merchant, Glasgo,w. I have an uncle in Huggins and Co.'s warehouse, and through him became acquainted with L'Angelier about two years ago. I frequently met him after that, and sometimes went to his lodgings. I remember on one occasiona finding him very unwell in his lodgings in Frakldin-plac., It might be the last fortnight of September or fis fortnii htt of October, 1856. He had Just come in from the office, when he became suddenly ilL. He put his hands ou his stomach, doubling himself up, and went to the sofa, coinplainiug of great pain. He afterwards went to bed. I T- visedh fim to send for a medical man, which I believe hedi,i I saw tim next day and asked him how he was. He said he had had a very bad night of it, and he said he had sent for a medical man. I think he said Dr. Steven, of Great Western-road. He has been in our house, but never met Mis Smith there, to my knowledge. Our family know the prisoner. Cro examined.-Mrs. Jenkins wa at home when LAngeller was so badly. I could not say she was present when he told me be had sent for Dr. Steven. robert Baird.-I am the brother of the last witness, and was acquainted with L'Angelier. It is not less than two Years since I became acquainted with him. I remember his asking me to introduce him to Miss Smith. He asked me several times to do so, He seemed very anxious about it. I introduced him to heron one occasion. I asked a gentleman to introduce tbem, but he declined. This was an uncle of mine. I think I asked my mother to ask Mss Smith somua evening and I would ask L'Angelier, and so introduce them, but she declined. They never met in my mother's house, to my knowledge. I introduced them in the street. He di i not ask to be introduced to Miss Smith's father, but he expressed an anxiety or determinAtion to be introduced to him. She was not alone. Her sster was with her. I am 19 years of age. Cross-examined.-L'Angelier once asked me to go to Row. I understoud he was wishing to see Miss Smith. He repeatedly expres9ed a desire to be introduced to her father. I have been in her father's house. Elizabeth Wallace.-I keep lodgings in Glasgow. M. L'Angelier lodged with me when he first came to Glasgow, ahout the end of July, 1853. He remained till theamonth of December, 1853. He alluded to his having bcea in the navy, and that he had been a lieutenant at one tinub. He did not say whether it was the French or British navy ; bnt I understood it was the Brtish. He just said he had left the navy. He said nothingabout hishavingsoldhi commissidn. He spoke of living in Edinburgh before he came to me. le said he hlid heen long out of a situation. He miade no allusion to Dandee; but he told me he bad been fre quently at Fife, and of his betng acq,"unted with families ithere. I do not remember what families he spoke of, or if he said anything of the Balcarres family. Cross-exanined.-He was a well-conducted young man when with me. Ho never mentioned names, but he said one day be had mnet with an old weethewa on her marrisgp jaunt. He had a gre6t aversionto medicine, and never touo He was cheerful, and played at night on the gDIta Occasionally. Colonel Fraser.-I reside at Portobello. I was not ac. quainted with the late hAL L'Angelier. He was never in my house, and never dined with me. At th-e thne of his death I received a note from Mr. George Wq1i4 mentioning his death. He mentioned his death a if r* a frieDd. I was very much surprised. There is no other Colonel Fraser in Portobello, but theo ig a Captain Eraser. Charles Adam.-I am a physician at Coatbridge and keep A draggist's shop there. rwag thereon Sunday Afternoon, the 2zd of Mac laM. I zemeniher a gerntleman camie in, and e askedoat fist for 25 dropa of laudai,nnm. He thenasked for sodawater.I said I had none, butl w6tld give him a soda powder, which I gave him. This Was about half-past 5 o'clock. I thought he was a military m . He wore a moustache. (Shown the photograph of h. L'Angelier.) This has a resemblance, but-I arn not quite cortaia if It is the person. It is like the Person The shop was dark at tetime, as the sbutters were not off. I'thiik- he had on a dark brownish coat and a Balnioral bonnet. There was a handkerchief stickaingeout Of his coatt pocket. Cross-examined.-He seemed to have left off spealdng to someone a the door when hecame to the shop. I am very seldomn in the shop on Sunday. By the COU1CT.-The gentleman did not complain of anything. E He swallowed the laudanum. I did not ask what he wanted it for. James Dickson.-I keep a druggist's shop at Baillieston, which is on the road between Coatbridge and Glasgow. It is about five miles from the latter and two-and-a-half from the former. I remember a gentleman coming into my hop on a Sunday evening in the month of March lastabout the end of the month, I think. It would be aboub half-past 6 o'clock. He appeared to be unwelL His hands were over his stomach and bowels, and he was complaining of pain. He wanted landanum. I gave him some at the counter. From 20 to 25 drops was the quantity. He gaid he had come from Coatbridge, and that he was going to Glasgow. He was about five feet seven in height, and wore a moustache. He looked from 25 to 30 years of age. He was not of a dark complexion. Hiscoat was tightbuttoned, and he had on his head a Glengarry or Balmnoral bonnet. (Shown the photograph of L'Angelier.) This is extremely like the person. I think he had a white pocket-handkerchief in his coat. Cross-examined.-I had some visits to make at a distance, and aa there were some Sundays that I had to stop at home, this enables me to remember that it was about the end of March. It might bave been In April. It could not have been in the beginning of March. I think his coat was darkish.coloured. I did not notice if there was any person with him. I did not look after him. It struck me he spoke with a slightly foreign accent. Re-examined.-My shop is not on the high road. It is from 200 to 300 yards off it. Bythe COtnT.-Theman requiredto gooutofhisway to come to myshop. He must hve left themirg.H took the landanum. m He hdiss Kirk.-I am a fhster of °eMr. Kirk, whokeeps a druggist's; shop in the G owgate.street, Glas2ow. It is east of Abercromby-street. I remember a gentleman comi into the shop on a Sunday night and getting something. I think it was in March, but cannot remember the day. It was about the end of it. It would be a little after 9. He wanted medicine. Do not remember what it Was. He took it awaywith him. It was a powder he got, but I cannot tell what. I served him. He was a young man, I think about 30. He was not-tall; rather to the little side. He was not very.thin, His complexion was fresh, and rather fair. He weore a maoustache. He had on a Glengarry bonnet, but cannot say about the rest of his dress. (Shown a photograph.) This is as good a likeness as I have ever seen. I was, stzuck -with bis appearance at the time, and noticed it particularly. He paid for the medicine. He took the mory from a little purse. (Shown a portmonnaie.} This is the purse. Cross-exanained.-I think this happened in March. The gentleman waaalone. IHe was about five minutes in the shop. I think the thoto aph shown to mo is the person. I can't remember w at e medicine was. I did not enter the money in. a book. We do not enter the money taken over the counter. There was nobody else in the shop except a woman, .I do not know her. I was asked if the gentleman calling had been buying medicine. I had not previously said anything about it. By3 Mr. YouIrG.-The woman in the shop remarked on the appearance of the gentleman. It was about his dre s shespoke, and about the hair on the lower part of his face Robert Morrlson.-I am in the employment of Messrs. Chambers, Edinburgh. They publish Chamners's Jourazl. (Shown four numbers of the journs], the frst in December, 18v1, and the last in July. 1856.) The circulatioi of the Journal is about 50,000.

(Shown the ntmuuUrgfo December, 1853.) The circulation of the magazine at thkt time was about 7,000. The Messrs. Blackwood are also the Rubliahers of the CGhymi3sry of Common Life, by Professor Johnston. It was published in 1855, bat it was originally published in pamphlets, the circulation of wvhich varied from 5,000 to 30,00.0, The circulation of the separate volute wo. about 10,000.' There is one chapter entihled the " Poisor.s we Select," and the first part is entitled the IIConsumption. of White Arsenic. Of the number containing that article' there were sold at the time 5,000, and the number sold up to the present time i numbers and volumes is about 16,000. The DEA N of FACULTIY then proposed to put in several lcttersfrom the prisoner to the deceased. The first wvas a letter in an envelope, with the postmark September18. 1855. It said,- "Beoved Emile.-5 have justreceired your 3ote. Isballumeet ye. I don,tc.re tbbghlbringacte uponmyself To ec youwiywoold do anything. Emits, ~ you salytb au' e d,serve it.

The third letter was taken up with the prisoner defending the young 3Idies in boarding schools, and at least herself, from some injurious remarks which deceased had made regarding them. Dr. Robert Paterson.-I am a physidian in Leith, and have been in practice there for several wears. I have seen sevencases of suicidal poisoning byarsenmc. They were chiefly cases of young women about the cbymical works. In souse of the cases they had got the arsenic about the works; in others they had purchased it. They all died with one oxcepton. I used all the remedies I could think of. In aU these cases the patients submitted to medical treatment. Not one of them disclosed before death that they had taken poison. I inquired of several of them if they had been taking poison or arsenic, but they all denied it. In the case of the recovery the young woman did not admit she had taken it until after her recovering from the secondary effects of the poison. In the previous part of her illness she waI ullen and morose. Arsenic is greatly used in these chymical works, and the people employed in them have great facilities for taking it away. By the LORD ADVOCATE.-The cases occurred in the space of 18 years. They had all the usual symptoms of poisoning by arsenic. The symptoms depended on what they had tken. They were all cases of known suicide. The time the symptoms came on after taking arsenic were various; but none of them exceeded 30 hours. By the COURT.-In cases of suicide the earlier symptoms are generally concealed. John Fleming.-I am storekeeper to Messrs. Tod and Higginbotham, printers and dyers, Glasgow. It is my duty to take charge of the dyeing substances used there. Arseuic is one of them. Wae get from 3cwt. to cFwt, of it at a time. We get it from Charles Tennant and Co. in its pure white state. It is used in making colour. It is got in barrels. The arsenic barrel is put into the store among the other things quite open. The lid is merely laid on. h'bree iuen and a boy work along with me. From SOlb. to 901b. is usually given to the colour-mnaker at a time. He gets this quantity several times a-month. No person gets into the store except those engaged in it. The arsenicis takentothe colonrroon in open woode-n pails. There are a great many people emp oyed on the works. I should not mise a fewv ounces at Robert Townsend.-I am manager. to my brother, 3r. Townsend, manufacturing chymist, Glasgow. We have large quantities of arsenic in our premises at a time-fronc one to two tons. It is kept in a private office. It stands in casks, one cask being open for use. We employ 1l0 to 140 people. I have no ooabt, if so inclined, any of theru migllt manage to take some away. I have never known it taken aFay Janet Smith, sister of the prisoner, 13 years of age, a sweet-looking girl, whose appearance occasioned much intere t,wasnexte"amine"d She boreaconsidersbleresemblance to the prisoner, but was paler in complexion. She gave her evidence with much composure. She deposed,-I whS liing in my father's house in Blythswood-square last winter and spring. I slept with Madeleine in the same room and bed. A generally went to bed before her. We generally both went to bed at the same time on the Snnday evenings. I remember Sunday the 22d of March. We went to bed together that night abont half-past 10, or afterwards. We went down stairs together from the dining-room. We were both undressing at the same time, and we both got into bed nearly about the same time. We might take about half an honr to undress. We were in no hurry that night in undressing. My sister was in bed with me before 1 was asleep, and she was undressed as usual. in her nightclothes. I do not know which slept first. We foll asleep not long after going to bed. I don't remember papa giving my sister a necklace lately, but he gave her one about a year ago. Cross-examined--I have seen my sister take cocoa. She never made it in her room, but she kept the packet there. We had a fire in our bedroom. We went to bed tbat niht the same time as usuaL I remember the morningMiadelenie went away. I suppose she came to bed that night, but I was asleep that night before it was her tine to come. I missed her in the morning on awaaking. Ee-examined-I have seen my sister take her oocoa in the dining-room. I do not know if she had been recommended to take it. No other body in the house took it but her. I found my sister in bed when Iawoke on the Monday morning about 8 o'clock. Dr. L%wrie; phvsician in Glasgow.-I have had my attention receitly directed to tho effect which arsenio has on the akin in washing. I have tried i to l oz. of Carrie's arsenic in water, and washed my hands fieely with it. I have also taken A oz, and washed mity face with it freely, aud felt ao bad effects. I used cold water after it. I tried the last experiment on Saturday. The effect on the hands s'emed to be that they were softened, as if I had used a ball of soap with sand ixn it. The effect swas iiot great, but if at all beneficiaL I do not think a grater quntity of arsed would mirake rch difference, owg to irs insolubility. I took an ordinary hand bai with the nsmal qanatity of water. DrDougas Mzalaan, phyicraninXdinbizrgb.-I haveha( some experience in Cases of poIoning by arsenic, and have devoted a good del ef a,ttentbn to the sabject. In washing wtth water with arenic in it so Ile of it would be dis. solved that I do not thlnk there would be any danger is so using it. It would not dissolve above i per eant. with. c3ld water. If a person merely washed the faoe and hinds in waterin which arsenio had been placed I think it would have verY little effect indeed In hot water there would be a little moredissolved, The quantity dissolved by pouring hot water on arsenic is not geat. In order to Laake water a smfficient solvent of arsenc it muat be boiled in it 'or sornetime. Id case3 of slght qutities of arsenic being taken the symptoms Very often reeexnble those of biiiouz or British cholerai attacks. In very severe cAes of arseica poisoning, terminating fatally, there is a very remarkable resemblanoe to persons iLabourig under maligant or Asitc cholera. Croes-eramnined.-Though a very smnall quantity only of arsenic is held in solution by cold water 1 do not say the same thig of its being held in suspension. A considerable quantity ot it would be suwpended in water, a; least if agitated. Though Ithink it might be safely done, I would not recommend washing with arsenic {n the water*; unless the mouth and eyes were shut, it might produce mosS in. jurious effects. Hugh Hart, Glasgow, deposed that Bridge of Allan is between two and three miles from Seirling, and that from Allo to Stirling is seven or eight miles; also that from Coatbridge to Glsgowr Is eight miles. This concluded the evidence for the defence, sad the Court, at 5 o'dock, adjourned t;ll nest morning at 10. (BY ELBECrIi AND IBT NATIONAL TELZGRAPI) EDINBURGH, TuZSDAy. The Lord Advocate addressed the jury in a very eloquent and elaborate speech of about five hours, analyzing with great minuteness the details of this painful case. Ee said, while expressing the gratificstion he slhoula feel if the juryr could give a verdict of acquittal consistently wlth their oath, that the case he presented was such that, as he believed, every link in the evidence was complete, and every loophole stopped by which the unhappy prisoner coul escape. The Dean of Facultyreplies for the prisoner on Wednesday (this day). It is not now expected the Lord Justice-Clerk will address the jury before Thursday.
THE CHAIRMAN OF TRE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THE INDIAN ARMY. We are requested by Mr. Ross Donnely Mlangles to publish the following, in reply to the letters of Major-General Tucker which we publshed on the 28th ult,, and of " Miles' which appeared in our impression of Monday last:- "Let me beg you to do me the justice to make as public as the charges against me the following extract from the speech which I delivered at Addiscombe-a passage which because I believe it to contain the trath, and wholesome truth, the manner in which it has been distorted to my prejudice cannot cause me to regret that I addressed to I the young men who are just entering or who have lately entered the Indian army.' I believe that they need such counsel, given oertainly, as I think that the passage will evince, in no mnkindly or ungenerous spirit by one much older than themselves, who spent the best years of hislife in India, and who learnt there not only to treat with due kdndness and respect every clas of the native commu. rity with which he was brought into contact, but to feel the highest admiration for those officers of native regiments of the good old Echool who knew and loved their men, and were looked up to by them in return with real affection and respect. When I spoke at Addis. combo I uttered not my own sentiments only, but the opiniorns earnesUy urged upon me, with entreaties that I would do ray utmost to inculcate them, as appropriata to the coniunctuie, by many officers of that class; and I have no fear that any officer of the East India C6ispany's Service who has any, the slightest, acquaintance w.ith my cbiiiacter and real feclings will believe for a nutnnent that I am so foolish and so false as to " cast asperSions" upon the gallant and distinguished srvice to which heboelongs, and with which it is to me a source of high gratiicNtion that, although a civilian, I long have been, and stil ?ohicially associated." Extract from the chairman's address to the cadets at Addiscombe, on the 12th of June, 1857:- "H e then said emphatically there was one point of para. mount importance to the efficiency of the Indian army on. Which be deemed it his duty to dwell at some length, in the hope that through the instrumentality of the press the words w*Mh he no w addressed to them might reach a much la-ger number of iorfng men who are just entering or who h -ve lately entered he Indian army. Andtheymightbelieve bim, those words were but the echo of the sentiment of every officer inthat servioe of ability and experienoe. It deeply grived him to tell them that all joined in lamenting the marked alterAtion in the tone and bearing of the younger officers in the Indian army towards the native soldiers of aU ranks. It vas, aeged, he feared too truly, that thel ind and cordial fe'dlio6 of comrades in arms, serving the same Government,iab bound to allegiance and loyalty by the same military oath, had been superseded by a cold and distant demeanour, ifnodt in some Jistances by positive rade. neos of behaviour. Such a state of things was greatly to be deplored. If that estrangement of officers from men, and especially of English from native officers, was allowed to continue and grow, it was impossible to calculate the fatal consequences that misht ensue. The attachmens-hbe devotion to the death of the native soldiery to their English commanders has been one of the proudest and most gratifying features in the annals of onr Indian empire. He would read to them the glowing words in which the great historian of our day describes a remarkable instance of that devotion. He is speaking of the defence of Arcot, the occasion on which the great Lord Clive, then scarcely more than a boy, first displayed his high nailitarv genius :-' During 50 days the siege went on; atring 50 days the young captain maintaied the defence with a firmnuess vigilance, and ability which would have done honour to the oldest marshal in Europe. The breach, however, increased day by dav. The garrson began to feel the pressure of hunger. Under such circumstances any troops so scantily provided with officers might have been expected to show signs of insubordination, and the danger was pecaliArl great in a foroe composed of men differing widely from each other in extraction, colour, language, manners, and religion. But the devotion of the little band to its chief surpassed anything that is related of the 10th Legion of Cwsar, or of the Old Guard of Napoleon. The sepoys came to Olive, Dot to complain of their scanty fare, but to propose that aU the grain should be given to the Europeans, who required more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The thin gruel, they said, which was strained away from the rice would suffice for themselves. History contains no more touching instance of military fdelity, or of the influence of a commanding mind.' For the honour of their country let them not fLing away throngh their own default the inheritance of this great moral power. He entreated them, therefore, to lose no opportunity of cultivating the attachment and confidence of the native officers and men. Their respect and esteem would abundantly repay anyexertionor self-denial which theperformance of thatduty might cost them. Like other men, they bad their troubles and anxieties. They would learn to resort to them for connsel and cornfort. Like other men, they had their gports and pastimes; they would be greatly pratified by their partakcing in or even by their witnessing them. They might look on or join within Droper bounds in such pastimes, without losing a article of their men's or of their own respect. He woald be the last to advise them, for the sake of winning a little temporary populanty, to take part in any amusement, or be present on any occusion unbecoming the character of Christian gentlemen. But courtesy, kindness, sympathy, and especially respect for the position of the native officers were not only not derogatory to that character, but they were Christian virtues which they were positively bound to exercise; and every link 'which such conduct on their part might forne in bhe chain which binds the native soldiery to their English commanders would give additional stability to the British power, and add to the strength and security of our nighty empire in the East He entreated them to treat the native soldiery with kindness and respect. It was by such meacs alone that a few hundred officers could hold the command of many thousands of men. Those were the principles upon whicb India had been won by tbeir predecessors, and which had enabled them to hold it; and nmost earnestly did he entreat them to follow their good ex-aple."
LIEUTENANT WVI oUoIs]GBY.-The name of this intrepid and devoted young soldier should be brought into prominence for the special admiration of his confers men. appily he has been saved for the present, and. if zbe injuries he sustained by the explosion of the powder magazine do noe ultimately prove fatal, he will, we hope, receive some marked tribute to his courae from the Government he serves. We believe that LIeatenant WiMoughby owed his cadetship-or, rather as we should now vrite, the East India Company are indebted for his services-to the late Sir Charles RJapier. The mother of Lieutenant WiUoughby, a moet exemplary and energetic person, was left with four fatherless children to struggle with a bard world. In the zenith of Sir Charles's popalaxity, after his return to England subsequent to the conquest of Soinde, sbe sought the General, told her tale, and entreated his aid in putting her sons forward. Sir Charles, though a perfect stranger to Mrs. Willoughby, immediatel applied for Addiscotnbe cndetshipe for the two Messs. W. longhby, and obtained them. They have done honour to the General's kindness and their mother's solicitude. Each officer stands high in the e5timation of the service, and one of them is now become celebrated for his rare valour and disinterestednesm-Unit4d &,)-vicc GOaate GRXnAT FIRE AT BE8n1tONDSXY.-Yesterday morning a fire, attended with a great loss of property, took place in Bermondsey, at Tyer's-gateway, on which stood the extensive range of premises belongin to Mr. W.

Tl}E AIT TREASURES PALACE AT MAH7CHEST.ER. -D)ring the extraordinary heavy rain that accompaled the thunderstorm about half-past 5 o'clocki on Saturday a great deal of water found its way into the Palace, chiefly, as far as we could see, in the Hertford Gallery, the Oriental Court, the south transept, and the galleries there. It will be remembered from our descriptions of theo construction of the palace that the columns are hollow, and that the plan adopted was to convey the water fromn the roofts through them to a, series of pipes tinder the flooring, froma 'whichL there are outlet3 to drains connected wvith the railway drain. Th3 entrances to some of the columns or pipes at tha points named seem to have proved insnfiient to take the immense bodies of water which were conducted to tbeo, or the entrances became accidentally clogged for almost immediately after the great burst of rain the water commenced spouting over the capitals of the cofumnrs and it continued to do so for some time. We noticed men climb to tho capitals; and as soon as a hand had been passed into the mouths ef the pipes the water was fairly carried oft. This led among the visitors to the very general belief that some applied plugs or stop ages had been removed; and the assumption that such had been the case led to assertions that there must have been neglect. We have the best ground for stating, however, that any such ides is totally erroneous; and that what was removed was simply dust or other matter washed from the roof. To this accidental cauise and to the extraordinary heaviness of the rain the irruption of the water must be attributed ; and, althovgh the showers yesterday afternoon and evening were very nearly, if not quite, as heavy as on Saturday evening, no water entered at the points indicated. As speedily as possible a number of pictures from a portion of the wall. apace In the nertford Gallery were taken down, the visitors being requested to withdraw In order not to impede the exertions of the officials; and a similar conrse was taken with the Oriental Court. We know that the walls of the long water-colour gallery were not affected by the rain; aud we believe that some statements which we heard as to the Turner Court were greatly exaggerated-indeed, almost without foundation. Daring the storm the company within the Palace showed a lively intterest, front a fear that great damage mnust result to things exhibited; bat it willtbe co-a solatory to all such to know that not the slightest appreciable damasge has been sustained by Any picture or other contiibution, and that the damage to the papering of the walls is very rmuch less than appeared imminent. These are facts as to 'which visitors this morning will be able ocolarly to satisfy themselves. Steps have been initiated and will be matured, to prevent the possibility of a repetition of the occurrence of Satuiday; and into any controllable cause that cotud have aided in bringLig abont that occurrence the most rigid in' nr will be made. It was deemed necessary to rinug the bell for closing at 7 o?alook on Saturdavy, instead of about 8-a measure withh1ich the visitors readily com. plied.-Manchlester Ouardia#tt.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, TUrBDAY, JTy 7. The LoRD CHAwELLOR took his seat upon the woolnok at 5 o'clock. Lord REDESDALE laid on the table a Bill for giving to Irish Peers the same powers respecting the taking of the oaths as are enjoyed by Scottish peers. PETITIONS. The Bishop of OXFORD presented petitions from the clergy of the archdeaconry of Buckingham, the archdeaconry of Winchester, and other places, complaining of the passing of the Divorce Bill, and praying their lordships to take some measures to prevent its evil consequences. Lord COLVILLE presented petitions from Terrington St. John's, in the county of Norfo'lk, and from the parishes of Claverley, Wiley, Barrow, Warfield, and Alveley, in Shropshire, against the admission of Jews to Parliament. Lord BERXER presented a petition to the same effect from a place in Norfolk; al fromt a place in Somerset8hire, praying for the correction of the intolerable evils connected with beershop6 The Landcort ind Sonthsea Improvement Bill, the Cardigan Markets and Improvements Bill, Wecarmouth Bridge Ferres, and Approaches Bill, South Durham and Lancashirse Union Railway Bill, Ely VaLley Railway Bill, Glasgow. Gas Bill, and Buem and Tunsta' Gas BilU were severaly read a third time and passed. CO&ALWEHPPERS BILL. Lord RAVENSWORTH presented a petition from partits engaged in the coal trade against this BilL Lord RINNAIRD, in rising to move that the Bill be referred to a select committee, said that the demoralizing effect of the publichouse system upon the coalhwippers led to the introduction in 1843 of a Bill by hr. Gladstono which was designed to correct the evils of the system. This Act was of an experimental character, and expired in 1843, when it was again renewed for five years. In 1851 a coramittee was appointed to inquire into the operation of the Act, who reported that both owners and men had derived benefit from it; that it had put a atop to strikes, and discouraged intoxication, while the price paid for labonr had not increased. In 18a6 Parliament was again called upon to legislate upon this snbject, but the influence of theecoalowners and shipowaer8 was sxtrongly e.xdted to persuade the Vice-President of the Board of Trade to withdraw the, Bill, upon a promise that they would volntarily establish asiunilar system. The Vice-President of the Board of Trade was satisfied with that assurance, but he stated that unless the engagement were carried out both in the letter and spirit he should bring in a Bil on the subject. If their lordships would granthim a committee he would undertake to prove that many of the evls of the former demoralizing system were now again in operation. He held in his hand the testiony of persons unconnected with the coalwhiiperr of the port of London, who asserted of their own k;nowledge that the publichouse sgstem of pmploling the co' bwhippars was aga inn operation, and was in.lrout to the morals and heat interests of the men engaged int this branch of' industry. His noble friend the President of the Board of Trade would, no doubt, contend that all interference in the matter would be contrary to the principlesofphiaconm;btw t hc int 9nair,)snh was, aot that there should be legislative interference between the employed and the employers but that the present system, which precluded these unfortunate coalwhippers from obtaining employment except through the medium of the publichonse keepers should be put an end to. Many instances could be pointed out in which the families of theee men had been runed by a resort to the old system. Only a few days before a man who had refused to run up a scoreat one of the publichouses had been kept waiting a whole day for the payment of his wag^s. At last, knowing that his wife and children were starving at home in his absence, he had assaulted the public-. house keeper. The result had been that he had beea taken before a magistrate, who, feeling that his case was a hatd one, had inflicted upon him the smallest penalty which was permitted by the law. Ho (Lord Kinnaird) might also mention anothor instance, in which one of these poor men. had drunk to excess in a publichouse, and had survived that excess only a few hours. Those unhappy occurrences he attributed to the operation of the present system, and he trusted, therefore, the attention of ]MAnoblc friend the President of the Board of Trade 'would be directed to the subject. His noble friend or the House ought not to forget that upon the celebrated 10th of April, when the country had been saved from bloodshed by the conduct of the working classes, the coalwlippers of London had acted in a manner which had gained for them the approval of both Houses of Parliament. The noble lord concluded by moving that the Coalwhippers Bill be referred to a select committee, under standing order No. 175, respecting Bills for regulating trade. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said that the Bill, inasmuch as it proposed to affect only a particular locality and a paricular body of men, must be regarded as a private Bill, and should therefore, in accordance with the standing orders of their lordships' House, have been introduced upon petition, so that all tho.e parties whose rights might be interfered with under its operation should have an opportunity of objecting to it if they thought proper. The motion of his noble friend was one, therefore, to which their lordships would, he thought, not deem it expedient to agree, even upon that prelminary ground. But, be that as it might, he was opposed to the gill upon the suabstantial merits of the case. It was quite true that in the year 1843 great evils did exist under the operation of a system by which coalwhippers were engaged by the owners of publichouses. Indeed, their case had been considered one of so exceptional a character as to justify the Government in passing a measure by which a monopoly had been established and the principles of poltical economy so far departed from. Thaf m6- h'-A een subsequenny ureu ur our tunes renewed, but upon its expiration in 1856 it had become a question with the Government whether it should be continued. That question having been submitted for decision io the department over which he had the honour to preside, deputations from the coalowners of the north of England, as well as from persons in the metropolis and throughout the country connected with the trade, had waited upon him, and had repre. sentedto him that the monopoly which had for some years been established had had the effect of raising in a considerable degree the price of coal, and had prevented employers from procuring the services of workmen so efficient as they woula boein a position to obtain if the market were unrestricted. Having listened to the reasons which had been put forward by those deputations, he felt himself obliged to concur in the views which they had put forward ; but he stated that previous legislation had had for its object the patting a stop to a state of things which all must agree in regarding as being of a very lamentable nature. He had thereupon been assured by the coalowners that they were rf atly willing to establish an offiee of their own, and t at the coals of London should be whipned only by persons engaged at that office. That proposition of the coaiowners the Board of Trade had accepted, and ho was hound to say that the agreement into which they had entered had been kept in the most exemplary manner upon their part. They had established an offic, in which alarge pro portion of the coalwhippers of London were engaged. Some of counrse, were engaged by gas companies and private individuals under the old system, but so far as he could ascortain, out of the 1, 200 men who were employed in the trade on the Thames 800 were registered at the office to which he referred, while 300 or 400 were engaged ia the service of private individuals and of the gas companies. Re, for one, would be extremely unwilling to revert to the former state of the law, and reimpose upon coalowners or shippers of coal obligations which were opposed to every sound principle of politlcal cconomy. (Hear, hear.) Lord RiVENSWORTH looked upon the Bill itself as a most exceptional piece of legirlation, although the proposal to refer it to a select committee might perhaps obtain for it some support. The Bill, however, was opposed to the principles of political economy, and would be subversive of that good feeling which onght always to exist between the em loyer and the employed. The system of which the noble or ad complained arose from a state of things which no lon,er existed. In former times the coalownor sold his coals to the shipowner, who whipped them and sold them wherever hc eould find a market, and the result was that the shipowners were compelled to make arrangements with the owners of pnblichouses on the banks of the Thames or other rivers. That state of things had, however, been completely put an end to, and coalowners generally were as much opposed to the publichouse system as tho noble lord himself. For his own part, he could not recognize the principle that exceptional cases afforded suffli cient ground for supporting a measure which would interfere between employers and employed. The Bishop of OXFORD replied to the objection that this Bilought to have been introduced as a private and not as a public Bill by stating that it was only a continuance of the act of the 14th and 15th of Victoria, which was intro. duced and passed as a public and general measure. He thought it wasa sufficient case in support of this BlU that this very laborious class of persons were only asking for the continuance of a protection which they had for some time enjoyed, and which they stated was necessary to save them from the greatest evils to which menL could be subjected. It would not interfere between the labourer and the employer, hut would protect the labour- market against the tvranny which the possessionof certain advantages would iwithout t enable pub licans and others to exercise. Earl GRANVI,LE did not think that the arguments of the right rev. prelate were sufficient to induce their lordships to pursue the course recommended by this motion. Lord COLCHESTER supported the motion. Lord STANLEY wished toIknow whether it was coopetent for the noble lord to introduace the Bill in this par- The Earlof MALMESBURY thought it was the duty of the Government, if they resisted this motion, to explain h .w the old law had failed, and why it was that It ought not to be renewed. He should be glad to hear the opinion of his noble friend the Chairman of Committees in reference to the point of order. lord :INNAIRD said that unlesm he had an assurance from the Government that a select committee should be appointed to consider the whole subject he should take the opinion of the House on this motion. (Hear, hear.) Lord REDESDALE was inclined to think that the Bill was a ublic Bill. Former Bills on the same subject had pass as publi Bills. There was certainly a clause in it which was a privilege clause-the loth-inasmuch as it gave power to levy rates. Their lordships divided, the numbers being,- For the motion ...... ... ;. 31 Against it ... ... ... 27 Majority ... ... ... 4 The motion therefore was agreed to. SOUND DUES BLL.

Lord BROUG A 1 rose to call their lordships' Attention to the very important subject of the administration of jus- Koe in the County Courts It was highly utisFactory t) Md ;hst the favoux ' e whi) the public regar4dg thesa coUrb, instead of decreasing or even standing still, had very mnuoh increased. The number of plaints brought in bad very greatly increased from 1852 to 1855. Notvwistanding the increased labours of the learned judges in these courts, it was proposed in fature to lemsen their remuneration. ID had been said that no matter wbat the salary for certain officers was, there were always far more applicants than were reqauired to fill up a vacancy; bat tnat was a very bad test; it was one that might be mado applicable to the most important offices, even to the very highest in this coantry, an ought not to beurgedin any case whatever as a reasonfor giving smallremnuneration. ( Hear, bear.) He must inform their lordships that there was one point with regard to which he had received many representations even from those most friendly to these Coan ty Courts, and that was the great diversity which prevailed among the judges as to the employment of depaties. Same of the learned judges performed the whole business them. Eelves:; ozhers, generally speaking,'performed the duties, bat occasionally employed deputies- and there were others who employed them still more. io0w, the return which he wlis eto move for was a return for the last 12 months of all the dittings of the courts, the number of days which each judge sat, the nurber of days they sat by deputy, with the name and description of each deputy so employed. He must say he regretted that, while we were extending the duties and jurisdiction of these jdges, and while from a vaiety of causes the buiness they hadtodischargewas constantr on the increase, such a time shopld be taken not to exte,but to lessen the amount of their remuneration. The noble and learned lord concuded by moving for the returns. The LOBD CHANCELLB, saw no objection to the productiou of the returns asked for by his noble and learned frend. As to the appointment of deputies, the existing regulation by statute was that each County Court judge should be entitled, with the sanction of the Lord Chancellor, to two months' holydaysin the year; and the depaty whom he appointed to actin his absence must be a barrister of a certain prescribed standing, whose nomrination was also approved by the Lord Chancellor. The two months' leave vas not necessarly two consecutive months', that limitation being nerely lntended to define the whole time to be allowed a judge within the year. County Court judges, like all other official persons, re quired periodical relaxation from their duties, and he mnst say that they had evinced no.dispositionto shirk the heavy amount of work which bad been cast upon theni. The returns forvwhich his noble friend, moved Would no. doubt show howr far illness, unavoidable accident, and othe'F causes accounted for the absence of the jadges from their respective courts. He begged to add his testimony to that of his noble and learned friend to the indefatigable manner in which theselearned gentlemenapphedtheiselves to their ardueus abours We had now had 10 years' experience of the working of the County Court system, and it was iucumbent on the Government to take an early opportunity of revising the arrangements orally made for carrying out that system, with a view, if possible, to distribute the duties of these judges more equally. The motion was then agreed to. WEIGHTS AND MIEASUIRES. Earl ZITZWILLIAM, in presenting petitions from owners and occuplers of land in the neighbourhood of Northampton and other places, praying for the establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures, took occasion to impress on Her Mtajesty's C overnment that the subject to which the petitions referred was one well worthy of their serious consideration. Lord BERNERS said that the measures of grain varled &o much in different parts of the kingdom that it was impossible for farmers to ascertain the prices at tke various markets by reading the quotations. HeItrated that the Govern. ment would think the question worthy of their attention. Be believed they would confer a great benefit upon the farmers by bringing in a Bill on this subject. Earl SPENCER could add his testimony to the Importance of this subject to the agricultural interest. The Earl of CLANCARTY believed that a uniformity of weights and measures was much wanted in Ireland, as well as in the rest of the united kingdom. Lord CAMPBELL presented a petition from officers of the Customs at Inverness and other places in Scotland in favour of a more equitable superannuation system. Their lordships adjourned at a few minutes after 7 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, TuzsDAY, JuLy 7.. The SPEAKER took the chair at 12 o'clock. The following private Bils were read a third time and passed:-Bourn and Essendino Railway Bill, Islington Parish Acts Amendment Bill, Lancaster and Carlisle and Ingleton Railway Bill, Rhymney RaUway Bill, Tweed Fisheries Bill, Coniston Railway Bil, Dexthorpe Turnpike Trust Bill, and Richmond and Ke'w Extension Railway Bill. BURIAL ACTS AMENDMEN BILL. On the order of the day for going into committee on this Bill, Sir W. JOLLIFFE said, the Bill would very materialy extend the powers of burial boards and give great additional centraihzing powers to the Rome Secretary. It would create enormous expenses in many places if the control vested in the Home Secretary were not vlgilantly exercised, and it would repress the action of vestries in every possible way. He believd that it emanated from a body m which the pgbli had very little confidence-namely, the Board of dealth. Many of its provisions would be rendered useless by another Bill which would soon be brought under the consideration of the House with refercnce to the public health, and he therefore suggestedthat the farther consideration of thisBilahould be postponed. Boards of guardians had 1revaeahmOpleeowers withregard totheborialofpaspers,and them by this Bill could only gave t.effect of increasing the existing prejudice against the operation of the Poor Laws. Mr.'3ASSEY said, that the hon. baronet was entirely mistaken in supposing that this BiUl would introduce any new principle with regard to the law of burials. The object of the Bill was to remedy some defects which long experience had proved to exist. The Bil did not emanate from the Board of Health, but from that department which was char'ed with the administration of the burial laws, and wbic, of course, had the best means of forming an opinion as to their defects. It had been framed upon a careftl consideration of the representations which had been made to the jHomo Department for the last two or three years as to the practical dificulties experienced in the ad. ministration of the burial laws. Its object was to render easy the action of very important laws, which had been very -*ccessful so far as they could be succes-ful, considering the obstructions to their effectual operation. He believed that it would geatly improve the sanitary condition of the countty. e was not aware that the Board of Health had been at al consulted with reference to it. Thethird section would empower the Board of Health to establish local burial boards, but the Bill would not at all empower any such local boaTd to tax. the ratepayers without their consent. Beforo the local burial boards could impose taxes it would be necessary that a certain proportion of the rata. payers should represent to the Home Secretary that it was desirable to confer taxing powers on those boards. Sir H. WILLOUGHBYwishedto know whether a pauper could under the sixth section of the Bill be buried in a workhouse burial ground against his consent ? (Laughter.) If so, he should certainly oppose that part of the Bill. One of the strongest desires of the people of this country was to be buried la theirown parish burialgrounds. (Rear.) He hoped, therefore, that the Government would promise to insert words in the Bill which would enable a pauper dying in a workhouse to give directions that heshouldbeburied in the churchyard of his own parih. Sir G. GREY said, the section alluded to by the hon. member for Evesham was not at all of a penal character. Its object was this-that if the churchyard of a small parish in which there was a union workhouse should be overcrowded by the burial of paupers, and the public health should be thereby endangered, the board of guardlans should have the power of establishing a cemetery, partly consecrated and partly unconsecrated, for the burial of paupers, precisely in the same way as if they were buried in the parish hurislground. Mr. KN{IGHT deprecated the proposed interference of the Government with the burial of the dead. The country heartily desired that the Government would let it alone on that matter. Ur. H. BERKELEY said, the shoulders of the Secretary of State for the Homo Department ought to be very broad, for whatever course he might take he had to bear the heavy complaints Xf hon. gentlemen. They saida few years ago, when pestUence vas in the land, that it would not have happened but for the neglgence of the Home Secretary with regard to burialgrounds, and now when ho proposed to interfere in that respect fervent appeals were made to him to do nothing. HEe (r. Berkeley) did not think it was probable that any powers which might be given to the Home Secretary with regard to burslgrounds would ba abused, and he should therefore be inclined to go further than the Bill proposed in that direction. Mr. DILLWYN thought the Rome Secretary had very discreetly exercised the powers already vested in him with regard to burialgrounds, and he hoped that the House would proceed with the Bill, forwhich he believed there was a necessity. After a few words from Sir D. L. EVANS, Mr. BARROW, and Mlr. CrLY, the House resolved itself into committee. Clauses 1 and 2, with some verbal amendments, were agreed to. On clause 3, Mr. KNIGHT mnoved that the words, "in case it appear to Her Majesty In Council, upon the petition of the local board of health of any district established under the Pablic Health Act," be substituted for the words "upon the petition of not less than one-tenth of the inhabitants." Sir G. GREY assented to the amendment, and the clause thus amended was agreed to. Clause 4 was also agreed to. On clause 5, Sir W. JOLLIMFE said, that the existing prejudice of the poor against workhouses wouli be much aggravated if there were to be cemeteries where paupers alone were to be in. terred. (Hear, hear.) Boards of guardians had already sufficient powers with respect to the interment of paupers, and he therefore mnoved that the clause be expunged. Mr. BARROW spoke to the same effett. Mr. WALTER thought that, where a churchyard was overcrowded, a simpler course than that proposed by tho clause was to give power to enlarge it. (Hear, hear.) Where that could not be dore additional ground should be pro. vided, equally accessible to the rich and the poor. He had a very strong feeling on this subject. Ho knew no case to which that text of Scripture which said, " the rich and poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all," should be so applicable as in that of churchyards. He wished to-know what was the definition of 'a pauper" according to this Bill Was It meant to include thoso who received outdoor relief, as well as those who were inmates of a workhouse? There certainly could be nothing more monstrous than that a person receiving outdoor relief should, on his death, be subject to be buried in one of these IInWXaglsd bhuriltounn, It seewrd to him (Mr. Walter) that the elause was unneessary. E feflt assured that it would be very huitful to the feelings of the people of this country. (Cheers.) Sir G. GREY said, that the clause was Itot compulsory, tut as there was a stronig feeling .gainst it k~e JpAiji sobjec. tion to its being struck out. (Cheers.) The clause was then struck out. Clause 6 was agreed to. Clause 7 was omitted. Clauses from 8 to 15, inclusve, were agreed to, On clause 16, Mr. LOCKE KlNGproposed thefollowing amendrient:_ "Provided always tbat no more than bne body sball be buried in any vault or grave in any cemetery or buriah. ground withia the metropolitan district, except in a vault or grave purchased for the exclusive use of a family." Sir G. GREY admitted that in the abstra&t only one body should be bured in one grave, but inasmuch as the Efome Secretary, who was a5sisted by a.large body of burial. grond inspectors, was vested with large powers on this sub3ect, and many of the metropolitan cemeteries were constructed beforo the burial lawvs camne into force, he thought that the committee would act wisely by not adopting the amendment. Lord EBRINGTON supported the amenament, which was opposed by Mr. AxYRSo, Mr. J. Locx, and Ar. The committee divided,- For the amendmuent ... ... 33 Against it . .. ... 188 xajzorlty ... ... -155 The ainendment was therefore lost. Sir G. GREY moved a Proviso, the object of which was to permit the interment of not more than Eix bodies in one grave on the same day, if two feet of earth were placed between each coffin. Mr. W. iMILES proposed that the number should be limited to four. The committee divided, Yor Mr. 3ilca's armendment - ... ... 131 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 79 Majority ... -62 The word " four" was then inserted in the proviso. Tho.chairman reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again. NEW MlEMBERl. " Major -GoroDoN took tho oaths and his sat for Banff'shire. The sittlg was suspended at 4 o'clock.

SCOTCH SALMXON FISHERIES. Mr. CAIRD asked the Secretary of the Treasury whether any progress had been made since February, 1853,1in obtainisga decision bythe House of Lords of the case of "Gamnmeil against the Crowvn ;" and whether the advantage of the right of salmon fisheries on the whole seacoast of Scotland, threin involved, had for four years beenJ lost to the public revenue by the postponement of tbe ahove case? llr. WILSON said, the appeal in the case referred to was heard in the EIouse of Lords mn 1853. No decison was yet given, but the House of Lords had recently intimated that they desired that the case should be ro:argnod, though they had not yet appointed a day for the purpose. Of course it wvas not withmn the powrer of the offlcers of the Crown to' hasten on these proceedings; they must wait until a day was fixed by the Lords to hear the case. A s to the question: whether the revenue of the Crowsn would suffer a loss by this. delay, that must depend entirely upon the conclusion at' which the HIouse of Lords arrived. SURVEY OF TOWS. Lord EWIO, in putting a question to his hon. friend the Secretary to the ''reasry on this point, said, that ,henV the surveoy of the rural districts was made on the six-inch scale, that of the towns was conducted on the scale of five feet to the mile; but when the six ineh scale was abdndoned in the rral districts a corresponding increaso was made in the towns, which wero thenceforward surveyed on the scale of 10 feet. As the yix-inch mscl was uowv abany doned in the ruralodistrictsheo wshed to ask upon ehato scael it was nOW intended to proceedw ith th surovey of towens in Great Britain and Ireland ? Mr. WILSO1N said, that the towFn SUrvey was proceeding, at this moment on tho 10-feet scae, and wehere that survey. had been begun it would, of course, be completed. The feture scale adopted must depenrld upon the decision of the House of Commons. No change bad been dedded on as yet with regard to the town surveys in consequence of the. esolution come to by the House. That resolution, it was understood, only referred to counDties. THlE ROYAL ACADEMY. Mr. CONINGRA asked the Secretary of the Treasury whether it vas the intentiOn of Her sMajesty's Government to remove the Royal Academy from that portion which it now occupied of the National Gaclery in Traalgar-s square ? Mr. WILSOn repliedthat thee whol of this matter ras at: present undeodde, beCaUE thereportof thoeCommissionors' appointed torinquire into it had not yet be aureceived by tno Government. Ho wwas not aare, however, of any intentionexisting at the present time to remove the Royal Academy from the building it now occupied. T ISTHS OF SADZ CANAL; Mr. H. BERKELEY asked the Irst Lord of the Trea- sury whether Her Majesty's Government would use its influence with His Highness the Sultan in supporb of an application which had been made by the Viceroy of Egypt for~ the sanction of the Sublime Porte to the construction of a sbip canal across tho Isthmus of Suez, for which a conces.! sion had been granted by the Viceroy of Egpyt to II.: Perdinand de Lesseps, and which had received the approbation of tho principal cities, ports, and commercial towns of the united kingdom; and, if any objection wero entertained by Her Majesty's Government to the undertaking, to state' the grounds of such objection ? Lord PALM ERSTON.-Her Majesty's Government oer-' tainly cannot nndertake to use their influence with tho Sultan to induce him to give permission for the constructlon of this canal, because for the lst 15 years Her Majesty's Government have used all the infuence they possess at Constantinople and in Egypt to prevent that scheme from being carried into execution. (Hear.) It Is an undertaking which, I believe, in point of commercial character, may be deemed to rank among the many bubble schemes thst from time to time have been palmed npon gullible capitalists. ("Hear," and a laugh.) I believe that it is physically impracticable, except at an expense which would be far too great to wartut the expectation of any retmrns. I believe, thereforo, that those who embarked their moiiey In any sach undertaking (if my hon. friend has any constituents who are likely to do -do so) would find themselves very grievously deceived by the result. However, that Is not the ground upon which the Government have opposed tho scheme. Private individuals are left to take care of their own interests, and If they embark in impracticable undertakings they must pay the penalty of so doing. But the scheme is one hostile to. the interests of this oountry-opposed tothe standing policy of EDgland in regard to the connexion of Egypt with Turkey-a policy wbich has been supportod by the war and the Treaty of Parks. The obvious pollit. cal teaddency of the undertaking is to render nmre e sy the Separation of Egypt from Turkey. Itisfounded,also,on remote speculations with regardto. .asleraccesa to our Indian possessions whichlaIeednot moro. distinctly shadow forth, because thoy will be obvious to anybody who pays any attention to the subject. [can only cx_ preEg my srprise that M. Ferdinand de Lesseps should have, reckoned so much on the credulity of English capitalists a;to think that by hia progress through the different eountiie he should sacceed in obtaining EogUsh money for the promotion of a scbeme which is every way so adverse to Britlsbn intorests. (Hear, hear.) That scheme was launched, I be. lieve, about 15 years ago, as a rival to the railway fron Alexandria by Caro to Suez, which, being isfinitely more practicable and likely to be more useful, obtained the pre. eminence; but probably the object which KL de Laseps ant% somo of the promoters have in view will bo accomplIshed, eTen if tho whole of the undertaking should not be carreie into execution. ("iHear," and a laugh.) If my hon.; friend the member for Bristol will take my advice, he win have nothing to do with the scheme in question. (Hears. hear.) METROPOLITAN TURNPIKES. Lord R. GROSVENOR asiked whether it was the lsten. tion of the Government to take steps towards the appointnent of commissioners to inquire into the best method or removing the tollbars now situated in the metropolis pursuing the plan which had been adopted in regard to those 2in the metropolis of Ireland and its vicinity. Lord PALMERSTON said that no doubt it would be~ very desirable to accomplish the object which his nobleI friend had in view, and that it should therefore receive the. consideration of Her Majesty's Government. He we. not; xrepared at present to sate the method by which it woul&d bebestattained, but the Government would place themselve3 in communication with the trustees of the metropolitan turnpikes to see what measures would be necessary, (Hfear, hear.) BRITISH IXERCH TS AT ULEABORG. 3fr. ADAMS inquired whether it was the intention orF Her Majesty's Government to introduce any measure, enabling them to grant compensation to British merchants. whose property at Uleaborg, in tho Gulf of Bothnia* badS been destroyed, on the 2d of June, 185I, by the boats of as squadron under the command of Admiral Plumridge. Lord PAIMERSTON said that the proceedings in thinmatter must be regulated by the principle which he ha& stated to be an international principle when a questioa, arose as to the losses sustained by British subjects at Gregy. town. He then stated the principle of international law to. be that persons who were domniciled in a foreign eonttry must abido by the fate of that country in peaco and var, and that therefore no demand could properly be mdad upon the American Government for losses sustained by British subjects in Greytown in consequence of hostilities. between that place and the United States. The ame p1in. ciple applied to the case to which the hon. gentleman no v referred. There were certain British subjects, and probablyithe subjects of other States, who were domiciled or had pro- peuty in the Russian territory. Those persons must take the chance of the Rusdan empire; and if by any cireum_ stance the place where their property was situated became the scene of hostile operations no claim could possibly be set up by those persons, whatever country they might be- long to, sagainst the Government whose forces carried oa the, hostilities by which they had been made to suffer. BENGAL MILITARY FUND. Viscount GODERICH, who had a notice upon tho paper for the appointment of a selecS committee to inquire into, the relations existing between the East India Company aud, the Bengal Military Fund, stated that, although it was not his intention to press the motion which stood in his name, be thought it due to the officers of the Bengal army that ho, should state publicly the reasors for the course which be, proposed to take, and in ordler that he might not infringe. the rules of the House he should conclude bis obaervations by moving. proforrnd, the resolution of which hehad givem notice. The fund in question had been established among the officers of the Bengal branch of the Indian army too afford assistanceto those officersunder certain circumstance3. and to provide pensions for their widovs, and it was supported partly by subscriptions from the officers themselvee and partly byassistance which was afforded them in variouoe ways by the E;ast India Company. CeitaiL differences hadlately arisen between the offlcers and the Company witEL. respect to the fund, and in consequence he had under. taken to bring the subject under the considerations of the House. In the course of last week hbowever, thosegentlemen in this country who represented the fund c#Ued upon him and stated that, owing to the news which badi arrived 10 days ago from India, and to the unhappy COndition of affairs in the Presidency of Bengal,they were most reluctant that any steps should be taken emanating from, them which might have the slightest tendency to embarrass. the Indian Government or the Company, or which mightseem to indicate the existence of dissatiXsfaction in the mindsof the offioers of the Bengal army. They had therefors: asked himn not to proceed with his motion. (Hear.) He. thereupon inquired whether they believed that in mxking that request tbey fairly represented the feeling of the subscribers to the fun, and they replied that they did. Thinking that that feeling was hiJhly homourable to theofficers in question, he at once acceded to their wish; but, although, under these circumstances, he intended to poet ponc nia motion, hol reserved to himself thefo31 right tc. Dring it forward in more liropitious times if be should thinlk it necessary; and he was sure that the case of these offioers would not be prejudiced by the postponement, which now took place in deference to a highly honoursbla feeling on their part. (Hear, hear.) He trusted that hin_ right hon. friend the President of the Board of Contro'~ would promise that the matter should have his consideration. during the recess, because be thought that the course which. had been taken by the officers entitled them to a full, fair, and generous consideration of their claims at the hands of the East India Company and of the Government. (Hear, hear.) He begged to move, pro form4, for the appointment. of a select committee to inquire into the subject. Mfr. V. SMITH said that, as his noble friendhad not. entered into any detail of his reasons for asking for a coni. mittee upon this subject, of course it was not his (Mr. V. Smit's) intention to trouble the House with details either Ts was a question in which the East India Company tookc oneview and the. military fund another, and the present. poition of the matter was this :-In June last the Court of Directors, with his sanction, Sent out a despatch, stating that, although they did not waive their claim tcthe right which they had established of making no, further contributions to that fund, still, if in two. years it should appear that the fund was not eqush to meet the charges against it, the directors would consider whether further contributions should not be made to it, those contributions, however, being entirely in the natur&. of generosity. He regarded the motion as a subject for futureconsideration, and the despatch to which he had alluded showed that it had not escaped the attention of the Governmaent and of the Court of Directors. Be need njot say that is bis opinion the conduct of thc gentlemen whom the noble lord representedwas highly creditable to them. No onesupposed for a moment that there was any disaffection on. the part of the oflicersof the Bengal service, and their conductupon this occasionhad been becoming to themasBriti. offcers and soldiers. To that he bore the fullest testimony. (Hiear, bear.) Mr. MANGLES (who was very Imperfectly heard in thbgallery) was understood to express his approval of the coursee which the officers had taken, and of the bigh sense of duty 'which had always actuated them. At tlie ssme time, ha thought that the noble lord bad acted with judgment an4 discretion in not pressing his motion at this time. TheComt of Directors had made large contributions to thes foudbeyond that which they recognized as a claim of riht5 and they had promised, if it Should appear at the end of two, years that the fund was not gufficiet to meet the demands upon it, that they would take the subject into consideration, and would regard it as a question fot their generosity. He was sure that there was every willingness on the tart of the Directors of the East India Company to act in a&liberap manner. The motion was then -withdrawn. THE LORD-LIEUTENTANCY OF IRELANTD. Mr. ROEBUCK then rose and said --Sir, I rise to bring forward a motion forthe abolition of the offlce of Lordlieutenant of Ireland under most auspicious circumstances Not that I mean that it will be so considered by the Bo iso, but that I believe it ought to be so considered. M1y late lamented friend Mr. Hume very often presed this proposl, tionon the House. HB brought it forward under very diffl. cultoircumstances. IrelandinlS24 wasinastateof cona1qon almost unprecedented. In 1830 he also broughtforward tha proposition. In 1844, atthe tine of themonstermaeetingSo£ Mr. O'Connell, he submitted it to the House; and in 185j the then Prime Minister, Lord J. Russell, subm,tted a Bill with the same object to this Houe, which was carrielI in this House, under the most disastrous circumstances. Ireland was then bjct to the consequences of the oos l dire famine that ever vsited that unhappy country. DBt now how differentare the eircamstances. Ireland is a put -an integral Part Of England, governed as England is, sub. cet to no political or natural misfortune. She is now happy in her Government-in her internal and external circumstances-she is, ii fact, a flourishing country, sr& baa nothing to complain of. I say this boldly. I sat thlt Ireland is a part-an integral part of the great country to whwch hhe now belongs, and has nothing to conplainf of i her Government, except in respect to the one matter which I am about to bring under the consideration of the Hosse, (Hear.) This House has often been called on to abolis the office of rd.leLteanteof Ireotnd-and'w?y? There are many aorta of alliances between countries. There aay be a federal association such as exists in the United SSates of America. That is an association, it I may so exprese myself, of integers; hut that is not the present assoeiation of Ireland with England. relandoughttoform part of an ssociation offractions. We do not say the united kingdcm4 but the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; ann Ireland ought to he a fractional part of the great country to which she belongs. She is not and ought not to be consi. dered an independent ounmtry; ana in so saying, letotn getlemnen from Ireland fancy that I have any wi t to sa anything offensive to them. Upon this point I may appeal to my long political career, and I will sy that if one rWor4 or act of mine could be found derogator y t o Ireland -I ehould b o myseludf.

I LONDON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Coalshippers Bill was referred to a select committee on the motion of Lord KINNAIRD. Lord BROUGEAI called the attention of the I:oRD CHANCELLOR to the efficient manner in whicl the judges and other officer3 of the County Ceurts dicharged their laborios duties, and movad for certain returns connected with theosittings of those courts. The LoRnD CHANcERLor coneurred in the, remarks made by Lord BBouGsrI:, and The returns were agreed to. Some other business 'Was then despatched, and their LordBhips adjourned.

There was a time when an Irish Vi=cuoy was a political necessity. Dublin was a long, an expensive, and even a dangerous journey from London. One could not reckon on doing it in less than a week. As for the provinces, they were more or less impenetrable. There was always a rebellion either in the spark, or in the flame, or in the embers. There was always somo very critical and questionable work to be done; a rebel to be pardoned and pacified, an aristocracy to be bribed, a conspiracy to be detected-something or other out of the line of British politics. So, even after the Union, when Ireland became legally a part of the one kingdom, it might for a time be prudent to keep up an outpost of Royalty in that balf-loyal realm. Then there was the existing fact of a Court, and there were those who had been introduced at that Court, and the qualification was, of course, somewhat more liberal there than here. It did not follow that everybody who appeared at Dublin Castle could take an ad eundem at St. James's. It was then a distinct and lower existence, but still an actual existence,-all the more because it was lower. If a man has all his acquaintances in the same rank of life they can all meet in his house; but if it is his fancy to plunge into an odd set here and there, with less selection in one place than another, he must go where his friends are, as they wil not all thank him for bringing them all together. A I second Court, then, implies not only distance and disunion, but inferiority; and that inferiority extends to the whole system. Courts have a rapid tendency to degenerate. Nothing but the strongest hand, if even that, can save them from favouritism, intrigues of all kinds, and a low tone of political morals. Where there are two Courts, one lower than the other, it is quite certain that in the lower, men will rise, deeds will be done, and practices will obtain, that never would in the higher, Court; though it may happen, and indeed generally does, that the higher is tainted by communication with the lower. Whether it be the neighbonrhood of the Legislature, or a dignity inseparable from, the seat of empire, certainly our statesmen feel more under control here than in their occasional visits to Ireland. There at once, by a sort of fatality, they seem to find out indifferent men, to get into Ecrapes, to condescend to low acts, and saddle themselves with degrading associations. Such a Court, then, is not only a second Court, a Deputy-Court, a delegation of Royalty and (Government, but a spurious thing, a bad imitation, a downright imposture. Everybody about that Court feels it to be so. The VICX=oy himself, partly puzzled, partly amused at his position, is in continual dilemmas between the simplicity usual to an English nobleman and the mock grandeur of a stage king. He l;nows that he is a monarch in buckram; he knows that he is a thing of the hour, made yesterday and going to-morrow; he knows that the whole affair is a piece of upholstery ; and when he "receives," and does his other Royal acts, he is only strutting his hour on the stage, like ELI.sToN, thoilgh perhaps not doing it quite so well. He knows that these very thoughts are passing in the minds of all about him. He is surrounded by ill-natured critics or condescend- ing admirers; but, one and all, they look to see I how he does a king, being, in fact, nothing of the kind, and sometimes a very unkingly man indeed. Behind the scenes what is the chief personage ? He is something between an UnderSecretary and a Lord Chamberlain. The second personage in the farce, the Irish Secretary, would be only too glad to find that he was equivalent to an English Secretary ; but he finds that he is nothing at all. It is bis duty to corrupt as many as possible of the Irish constituencies, and so wrest them from the Priest or the Orangeman. In fact, he has to meet with secular promises the threats of eternal perdition ; and of course the Bank he has to draw upon is more limited, and its engagenients sooner due, than those of his opponents. Corruption, of course, there will always be in this very mixed sphere, but there need not be a department and a sham Court, with nothing else to do. No argument was urged last night for the continuance of the fiction, except the difficulty of devising a substitute, particularly just now at the end of a session. It is a system consisting of many offices, involving many interests, maintaining some shopkeepers, increasing the rents of some houses. It has a large staff, plant, and following. Such things cannot be abolished in a hurry. It costs not only a great effort, but even a temporary increase of expenditure, to reduce an overgrown establishment. This is very intelligible reasoning, but it is only good for a day, or a year, or as long as is necessary for people to turn about. Otherwise, no better reason can novw, be given for a Viceregal throne at Dublin than for one at EdinbIurgh, or Manchester, or a dozen other important places. Does it promote residence ? What is the fact ? During the severalhundreds of years that Ireland has had a separate Court, and: even a separate Legislature, it suffered more from absenteeism than any other part of the empire. The most distant provinces of England abound in resident gentry. Scotland is in more request than ever, and for several months in the year every habitable house is occupied. All the northern and western counties of England, from Durham to Cornwall, contain many handsome mansions, prosperous towns, and a thriving population. Yet these are far beyond the sphere of a Court. But Ireland itself is recovering from its old bane of absenteeism exactly in proportion as it is lapsing into a British province. The more it becomes England in politics, the more also does it acquire the social system. of this island. The new proprietors who are carrying enterprise and capital to the extreme west, north, and south are no mere hangers-on of a Court. .It matters not to them. whether they will ever ba received at the Cattle or not. They want no titles, andare indepc.ndent of office. The vigorous spirit infused intq Xreland, and leading to these happy result", is ne,ther that which has prolued siuiilar fruits in our own populous districts. That e'terPrise which has created our great manufacturing cies. which has joined them one to another with chain.C of towns, and sown the country.so thick with villages, mansions, and homesteads that the stranger ,hardly knows when he is in a town and when in the country, is absolutely independent of Court, eXcep. in its legitimate capacity, as the abode of a constitut.onal Sovereign, surrounded by thepublic offices and the hals of the Legislature. From such a Court notbing is wanted but law, justice, order, and good government-not patronage, expenditure, titles, and honours. Such a Court Ireland may always have in that of Queen VICTORoA, and does not want another at Dublin.
With the approaching close of the Parliamentary Session must revive the interest in those distant regions of the East where the forces of more than one nation are gathering. Probably by the time the autumn tourists are once more settled at home, and busy with their old occupations, we shall learn that our troops have encamped on Chinese ground and that our gunboats are ascending the great rivers to exact reparation for the insults of a year before. The acts of our commanders it is impossible and would be useless to predict. In such matters the events, resources, and opportunities of the hour must guide those who have the conduct of affairs, and success is often best insured by the absence of a plan which may have been faulty in conception, or may at least prove inapplicable to some unexpected state of things. A11 that it is necessary to establish beforehand is the general policy which is to rule our future dealings with the Chinese empire. What Lord ELixo is to demand, and not how the General and the Admiral are to enforce his demands, is the subject on which there should be no misunderstanding. Now, before discussing this point it may be as well to examine the opinions which other nations hold with regard to our proceedings. The judgment of the Americans as given through their press, and by the Minister they are about to despatch to China, is certainly most favourable to the claims of this country and the spirit in which they have been urged. The conduct of Lord PA.RsSTON could not have been more approved at home than in New York and Boston, and the verdict which his own countrymen gave against his antagonists has been ratified by a people who have had their own experience of barbarian insolence and cruelty. From the other great Power which has promised us its support the judgment of approval is equally decided. We do not speak of factions and their representatives in the press and in society, but of the moderate and honest, who place the well-being of their country above the successes of party. Among the publications which are left in France the I'etnee des Deuxix Mondes stands in the highest rank, and an article which appeared in one of its late numbers places in a just light the present situation of China, the excesses of its officials, and the necessity of European interference. This article, though bearing another signature, is understood to be the work of an Orleanist Prince, whose warlike tendencies and plans for the supremacy of the French marine were the objects of no little curiosity some years since. However, like many others, he has learnt to do justice to the nation which formerly excited his jealousy; mature years and the calamities of his family have brought with them soberness and a chastened judgment. The author begins by acknowledging the decline of the Chinese Empiro and the necessity of its fall. The system to which almost every philosopher of the past century offered his ignorant praises is now discovered to be only a hierarcliy of imbecility and wickedness. The seclusion of the ETEarBon, who knows nothing that passes beyond. the l:mita of Polkin; tho-omiptin if thoWanarina, who buy their places, and of course sell justice and employment; the gross sensuality which prevails among all classes; the carelessness of human life, resulting in incessant executions, in systematic infanticide, and in the application of torture on every pretence, are all proofs of the inability of the Chinese civilization to struggle any longer with thle energy that is at its gates. Add to this that a great part of the empire is in possession of the extraordinary army of rebels wbich has now for some years attracted the attention of Europe, and it will hardly be denied that the intercourse of Europeans with such a people must sooner or later lead to conflicts, in which the less civilized nation will be the offending party. So for many years the late events have been preparing. The British have been pushing on their trade at all the ports of China and the Archipelago; the Chinese themselves have been pouring out of their crowded country to AngloSaxon settlements in various parts of the globe; the twvo peoples have been brought face to face, and the mingled fear and vanity of the Chinese have led them into the acts of violence for which atonement is demanded. WVith regard, then, to the justice of the English cause the author has no doubt. The English power has been seriously offended, aud will impose a fitting retribution; the only thing to be decided is whether France shall join us in our operations. Shall the French, to use the electoral term, " abstain," or shall they co-operate in an enterprise which they cannot prevent, and which they ought not to desire to prevent? The author declares for co-operation on a scale consistent with the strength and dignity of France. England, he says, has requested France and the United States to act in concert with her. " It would be unfor" tunate if the appeal were not heard. The right "would thenceforth be given to England of bring"ing to a conclusion this great affair, and appro"priating to herself all the results. In spite of "herself the world would have forced her to "accomplish in China something like what she "has accomplished in India. After having "exacted vengeance for the savage acts committed " at Canton, we should see her occupy the Isle of "Chusan, and perhaps Formosa, the coal mines of "which promise an abundant source of riches." To avert this danger France should join us in whatever we do, and no English gunboat should be seen at any point of the coast without a French double volunteering its friendly but watchful assistance. Then would come a treaty, by which the Powers engaged in tlle operations " should "engage to exercise on China a moral and material "influence, in order to obtain for Europeans the "right to travel, trade, reside, and possess pro"perty on all the points of the empire, with the "right also of professing and teaching their "religion. The allies would engage equaly to acquire no point of Chinese territory without tho "consent of all, and to extend the rights of a "European subject to no Chinese -without the "accomplishment of certain conditions. arrangedin "common." Such is the programme to which the writer desires that England and his own country should agree. Now, on many points WO cordially aequiesce in these opinions. Let France, let she United States, haveotheir full share in the advantages which must attend the opening of the Chinese empire. The American trade is large, and will be Larger; San Francisco is on the other side of the Ocean, and we have no wish to deny the interests and the legitimate influence of the Ilepublic. Let France also do all that she wishes. In default of commerce or political relations with China, ehe asserts the protectorate of the Catholic religion and the care of Europemu 6iviiization. Be it so. Wbeu all nations have a free right to enter Crnaa, Catholic Ipriests-will benefit like the rest, and any &a:ngexment which the authorities of the Church may make with the French EMpEROn for placing those m=ionaries under the protection of his Ambassador -will ,ieet no obstacle from us. But from the latter pa-t of the plan we entirely dissent. We have asked the concert of other Powers in order to assist' our operations, and not to impede them. If we a xe to send fleets and arimies to the Chinese Seas with .1 precedent arrangement that we are to occupy no spot of ground and grant naturalization to no ChiLsese in Hongkong, Singap-re, or Sydney, we guight as well keep ofir troops at home and save our money. We have been injured, our flag insul6ted, our Plenipotentiary refused justice, and our fellow- tizens shot, strangled, - and poisoned by a set of barbarians andc their chiefs. For the3e outrages the British overument is about to tash. satisfaction. Believing, however, that the interests of humanity and civilization might be advanced by zproperuse of this opportunity we have freely offered, to other nations a share in the operations c0! which we have decided. As we acted 15 years ago we propose to act now. Then England gave to all nations an equal share in the advantages she had gained by an expensive war, and now an expedition of which we shall bear the chief burden will bring rich gains to every nation which has the energy to use the new opportunities. But any one who expects 'us to bind ourselves to conditions totally nmstakes the intentions of the English d~overnnent and the spirit in which its request of co-operation was made. Should the occupation of Chusan, or of any point on the mainland, conduce to the attainment of the objects of the war, we see no reason why it should not be occupied. Let France also have her settlement, if she wishes itwe shall lhave no objection-but let her not seek to restrict us. The conquest of China is, of course, out of the question, but that one or more European peoples should possess settlements on the Eastern Coast of Asia seems to us no very monstrous proposition.
As it seems decided that we are to be an artistic people we may as wel begin at once to play the part seriously. Whether England is ever to have great historical painters, sculptors of classic genius, gifted carvers, and potters, aud upholsterers, and pattern-designers, is hidden in the future; but one thing seems determined-namely, that we are to rival or excel every other country in the wealth and extent of our Mluseums. Both Government and individuals are accumulating treasures at a rate wbich puts to shame the enterprise of countries of more professed connoisseunrship. One Englishman despoils a Venetian Palace which has been the cynosure of traveUers for half a dozen generations; another is busy among Spanish churches and convents, eager to carry off some " Adoration" or " Assumption" from its time-honoured wall to a back room in Tyburnia. We are digging up Carthage, Halicarnassus, Nineveh, Babylon, and Susa in search of something beautiful, or quaint, or historically instructive. In three or four places, under as many different' governments, we have collections in which every kind of art is attempted to be represented in all its forms. No effort of genius, no caprice of ingenuity, comes amiss to our omnivorous collectors. Paintings, from the Saints of five centuries since to the dogs and deer of the present day, Greek statues, Roman statues, English statues, hIajolica and PTIassy ware, Renaissance furniture, with all the infinity of, articleg'which our pre-artistic fathers used to class together as old curiosities, are being collected mi Bloomsbury and Trafalgar-square, and Marlborough-house, and the Bronipton sheds, with a perseverance which must make the exacting enthusiast acquit the Government of indifference to what ii' called " art-bpogress;" A Pr= who -refused the Venus de Medici at the present day would stand a chance of being harled from power, and the only fear is, that under popular pressure the Government may spend too much money in building unsightly palaces for second-rate contents. However, it is no doubt the duty of the proper authorities to provide some fitting place of exhibition for these fast accumulating treasures. For two sessions the battle of the sites for the National GaUery has continued, and the question has at length been decided in favour' of the present location in Trafalgarsquare. The question is, when is that decision to take effect ? The quantity of pictures which still want a permanent home is very large. The VERNO.y Collection, though of very unequal merit, still contains a large number of paintings which are worthy to have a place in a National Gallery. Then there are more than a hundred Tunw-Rs, many of them of the large size which the more ambitious painters of the last generation affected, and requiring a good deal of room for their proper exhibition. Nor can we doubt that further giftsand bequests will follow. The enthusiastic collector not unfrequently thinks more of his collection than of adding to the wealth of those whom he leaves behind him. Many a man who knows that his son and heir cares nothing for art, and that after his own death his dearest treasures will pass into the hands of rival connoisseurs or dealers, will be likely to reflect how well his collection would be kept together in a national institution, and how much good he might effect by so disposing of it. It is evident it is only by such means that the nation can expect to obtain a really great collection. Few of the masterpieces of foreign art are now to be bought ; the age of revolution has passed away in France and Italy; neither Governments nor private individuals are under any pressing necessity of parting vith their works; even where the nobility are poor they are likely to sell to their own Government more wiDingly than to foreigners, and all over the Continent the State has taken upon itself the patronage of art, and will purchase at a large price any really excellent worlk Then the world is becoming very rich, and the mania for collections has spread everywhere. The French buy, the Russians buy largely, Dutch moneydealers and German Princes are equally eager to gratify *their taste or invest their capital; even the Americans are coming into the market to raise the old tariff of art. Tie prices given for third and founrh rate works within the last few months would, have bought the masterpieces of RuTrA-us. sixty yeas. ago. The nation must therefore look mainly to the patriotism of individuals for augmenting its collections with first-class woaks; and, certainly, no one will give who does not fetl that the country has provided a pror home for hin gifts. As Trafalgar-square, then, has beenr decidedz on as the permanent seat of the Nationst Collection, it is as well to take measues at onso for the erection of the edifice which bas been tQ subject of such expectations and disputes. Into the details we need not enter. It is plain that sooner or -ster the present building must give p7ace to one more wortlhy of the site and the purpose. But we are now concerned with the building as it stands at present. When we shall get another National Gallery may be a doubtful m.atter; that we ought at once to have the full uze of the existing edifice cannot be questioined. At pre-tent the long narrow building is divided into two parts, and half of it is given uip to a lody which, though connected with art, has no claim to be housed in so important a situa, tiop. The question of Ifr. CoxzamuG irn the House of Oomiiiofg Lat evening xeems, therefore, £ufflciently waeil tiined. The wholo mattet amount! to this,-that w_l4jl the natiC,yi has no place foi tkLA works of art whfck belfmg to it, it gives ur balf the' whole of t1z, space me ,ts disposal to a Society' which is perfectly able to provide itself with a home. The Royal Academy lb' a self-elected and &ilf-governing b>ody of artists, whd Ecmetimes are and sometimes are not among the Ifirst of the country. This Society possesse3 pro- perty, and is said' indeed to be very rich; a few months since it received 20,0001. wnder the will of the late MIr. Tu-Ei la these rooms, which the Acadeticians occupy. by pezmission of Government, they exhibit yearly a large number of works of art for sale, and charge an atnmiesion fee of a shilling for the sight. From this source, and from the sale of cataslgues, they derive a large annual revenue. That they perform any national duties, or are ia any way a national body, there is no pretence for asserting. They are simply an associacton,-an lhonourable and beneficial association, no doubt, but still having no claim to represcmt the country or to be maintained at its expense. Their connexion with the building in Trafalgarsquare has always been assumed to be temporiry. When the collection of Mr. AxGOnsTkax, then recently purchased, had been increased only by a few presents and bequests, and when there was littlze interest taken in art, four or five rooms were sufficient to contain aU that the nation possessed or seemed likely to possess. So the Royal Academy was allowed to install itself in the east wing, to which it migrated from Somerget-house. But even then it was declared that, should the national pictures so increase in nuumber as to require further space for their exhibition, the Academy must seek other quarters. That time has evidently come. The nation wants the whole of the building, and the Academicians must remove. The other Societies of Artists' have no help from Government, and yet are able to hire rooms and hold exhibitions. The Royal Academy would do well to follow the example of independence. If, however, it be thought that by seniority or prescription it hai a right to national gupport, let it be housed in some other edifice. Burlington-house seems extensive enough, and possibly the Academy might findl room there for a season. Bat Trafalgar-square should now be devoted to the National Collections.

HE1n MAJEST'S TEHBATR. Mademoiselle Piocoloniini, vho took her benefit on Monday night, not only charmed her audience by her perform. ance in one act of the unfading Figlice d4Z lbqgimcnto, and another of the imperishable, though consumptive 2'auirata, but she astonished them by her representation of Paolina, in a scene taken from Donizetti's epera, I iUartiri. This worlk, originally composed under the name of Poliato for the dab2U of Nourrit at Naples, and afterwards nrranged for the Paris Opera-house with the French title, Lea Martyrs, has neverbeen played in this countrv, thonuh the subject has been rendered perfectly familiar by thePolyctelt of Corcille, acted at the St. Jamees Theatre during the engagement of Mademoiselle RacheL Indeed, the scene of the trgedy, which has doubtless left the deepest impression on all who witnessed it-namely, that in which Pauline exclaims "Jo crois !" precisely corresponds to the scene of the opera selected on Monday night. Signor Ginglini was the Christian husband Polinto, on the point of martyrdo-&, Mademoiselle Piecolominihis Pagan wife Paolina, visiting him in prison and anxious to savo him. When she had poured forth torrents of grief with the most agonized eloquence' her convorsion to the true faith was supposed to take place, her countenance beamed with holy rapture, and the fine. voice of Giuglini blended with her ecstatic strains, while the instrumental accompaniment indicated tbe sympathy of a celestial choir. 31ademoiselle Piccolomini had never before undertaken the delineation of emotions so elevated, and her success surpassed expectation. An encorc of the concluding movement was imperiously demanded, and the reappearance of the two artists was the signal for an overwhelming shower of garlands and bouqueta. The objection to the performance of Poliuto, made on religions grounds by the Neap3oitan Governmen, though it is s3id to have occasioned the snicide of the fatnons Nourrit, will probably meet the sympathy of many English Anditors. But with respect to the production of the scene just descrbedat Her3ajesty's Theatre, it should be borne in mmnd that the entire tragedy, which is open to the same objections as the opera, was played for more, than a season with impunityas a "French play," and that thus tho manager of the Opera-house did net bring tho subject to London, but found it ready established.
ADELPHI THEATBE. The Fairy Circle, a dramafamiliar, we believe, tothe American public, was on Monday night played for the first time on a London stazo. It combines a popular superstition of tbe Irish peasantry with an anecdote taken out of the rebellion pexiod, and thus AIr. Barney Williams, who plays the prin. cipal character, has to face the human officers of justice and also the elfin "good people" whohaunt the neighbouoring heath. Con O'Carolan, as the interestingpeasant is called, has a great fancy to b-comeoas rich as his wealthy neighbour, PbiloD Blake (Mr. Charles Selby), and a hearty wish to po serve the life of Robert O'Neill 'Mr. BWilgton), a luckess Wgntleman of the '98, of whom Blae, formery a steward in is family, is the deadliest persecutor. The latter purpose O'Csrolan endeavours to effect by concealing O'Neill in his cottage, and thus exposing his neck tointheite risk; tho former he woould attain by sleeping in a certain " fairy ring," believing that his dreams will inform him of the vhereabouts of some long-concealed tbesure. The fairies come to him in his slutmbers, and, though they do not exactly reveal any hidden wealth, they show him. a series of visions, in which certain events important to O'Neill and Blake are clearly represented, while O'Neill, who finds him sleeping, and is hotly pursued, exchanges coats with him, and when danger is over places a purse by his side. As this purse turns out to be the property of Blake, poor Con O'Carolan, who is arrested on suspicion, is on the point of being condemned as a robber, but he is saved by the interposition of O-Neill, who in his turn is saved through the interposition of a friend in the English army, and marries Blake's daughter, Blake himself getting out of the way on accoslnt of certain untoward roveltiops in Con O'CarolWs dream. The construction of this piece is as upskilful as may be, scene4 are perpetuaUy cbange without eorresponding variety in the action, and these is an obscurity about the plot that, wo fear, extends to our brief recita]. Bet the defects of the Fairy Ci,-d4 thou"h any' thiri bet trivial, are completely counterbalaucedl by!.r Bar ney Williams's usmirable assumption of the Irish peasant, whose torague is always ready with an answer, and whose eye is a.sways sparkling with vivacity, whhbber a magistrato or a fairy king is the person addressed. In tl-e dream a com3cal effect is produced by tho exhibiion. of a aummy as the body of the sleeper, whilo MIr. Barney Williams reprosents his soul, and the uneasiness of bho Hibeznian intel. lect in this state of dichotomy affmods. occasion for much sportive pleasantry. The sght of the body with. out a coat gives great anxety, for instanco, to the soul that contemplates it, and reflects that when a reunion is eflected in tbe morning it may have to endure a rheumatism. 0G.Carolan, it should be observed, is provided with a wife who can scoM him in a time of peace, act as his poDWRXUl ally in a time of War, nnd ccndole with him in a time of trouble, nd this wife is represented with great spirit by Mrs. Barney Williams. Tholoudapplause which fobowed tk-3fall of the ourtaln must be attributed entirely-to the merits of the actors.

MONRY-ABKBT' and CITY INTELLIG NCE. Tuesday Evening. The news from Paris of the defeat of the Govermment candidates in the elections yesterday, and the apprehension that this event is but the commencexnent of a new period of political disquietude, caused the English funds to open to-day with increased heaviness, and to continue dull and inactive to the close of business. The anxiety, which increases with each hour of suspense, on the part of the large number of persons who have friends or relatives in India likewise communicates itself to the public at large, and creates a univermsl effect such as has rarely been witnessed. Consol8, which left off last evening at 92k to i, were quoted at the further decline of 921 to i, and experienced no variation, the fresh arrival of specie from America and the s'eady inux of bullion at the Bank of England failing to produce any rebound. Bank Stock closed at 212k to 214; Reduced, 92k to J ; New Three per Cents., 92J to a:; India Stock, 216 to 218 ex dividend; India Bonds, 9a. to 5s. discount; and iExchequer-bills, 5a. discount to par. Money was in demand to-day in the Stock-ExcYange on Government securities at six per cent., the circumstance that all the advances made by the Bank during the shutting must be repaid bv Saturday next tending to absorb the available supply. l'be amoIunt of these advances, however, is believed not to bave been such as will lead to any pressure in their being met. In the discount-market this morning some exceptional transactions took place at ei per cent., and at the Bank there appeared to be few applications. Great doubts are expressed as to the probability of a lowering of the rate of discount even on Thursday next. After to-day, however, the course which the Bank may adopt will not be a matter of immedlate importance. While the revenue payments were flowing in and the open n arlket was thus being straitened, the Bank had the rate at their own command; but the disburse:nent of the dividends will, for a short time at least, render the public independent. A reduction on Thursday week, in the abeence of any unlooked-for casualty, is regarded as certain. In the foreign stock-market a fair amount of business was transacted, in most cases at about the Irices of yesterday. In Peruvian a reaction from the late rise took place of 1J per cent. Brazilian Four-and-a-Ifalf per Cents. were negotiated at 96i; the Five per Cents., 1843, at 98i; Danish Five per Cents., 102; Mexican, 22 ; Peruvian Four-aud-aflalf per Cents., for the account, 8k, 4 , 82k; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96 ; Sardinian, 90 891; ditto, for the account, 89i; Rpanieh, 40k 40; ditto, New Deferred, 25; Turkish l?our per Cents., Guaranteed, 102k; and for the account, 102. In the foreign exchanges there was no change of importance from the rates of last post. The Paris Bourse opened with increased heaviniess, but at the close the Three per Cents. returned to the auotations of yesterday-67f. 15c. for money, and 67f. 20c. for the end of the month. The letters from Paris to-day state that the recovery in the bullion of the Bank of France continues, and that the forthcoming return wiU probably exhibit an increase of 200,0001. or 300,0001. over that of last month. About 55,0001. in gold, chiefly Australian, was told to the Bank to- day. The specie from America to-day is 2G0,0001. only, a moderate portion of which in on French awount, and the Fulton may be expected on Friday with a further sum. The commercial advices on this occasion show a further depression in the New York Stock-market, although the Bank returns for the week had been very favourable, and we have thus an instance of the three principal stock-markets of the world-New York, Paris, and London-simultaneously exhibiting an unexampled and apparently incurable depression at a time when the Bank returns in each country are improving. Erie Railway had falen' to 281 New York Central to 81 to i, Illinois Central to 27 to 29 pm. ex. div. (the bonds to 94, to 95), and Reading 711. According to the New York Times, "All. the experience of the preceding five or six months in bold and shameless gambling against railway credit and the values of the country generally had been excelled by the operations of the past few days." Money was in rather increased demand, but was stiU abundant for aU legitimate purposes, and the growing crops presented a very satisfactory appearance. The advices from Oporto regarding the prospects of the vintage continue altogether bad. As statements on such matters affect prices, they must of course be received with caution, but the following letter is from a highly respectable source, although an interested one:- " Accounts from all quarters agree in stating that during the last few hot days the progress of the I oidinue has been terrible. My vines were free from it, and became covered vith it in 48 hours. They were well sulphured and a thick bed of sulphur was placed under them, and Is under them now, subject to the constant aition of a hot sun. " A person in Villa Nova, who sulphured well, asiured me only yesterday that his vines were quite free. I desired bim to send me the finest and most vigorous shoots covered with grapes. I received a quantity this morning-stems, laaves, grapes, all covered with the oldium, and the smell peetilential. This person says that the whole has appeared within twvo days. " I find tbe opicion that sulphur will not do much for the vines gains ground. This must be caused by the uniformity of accounts from the different Douro districts. "I consider the Douro crisis over; the disease as bad as list year." The following refers to the Bill promoted by the directors of the Great Northern Railway to make the preference shareholders pay for the frauds of Redpath, and which appears to be quietly passing through the House of Lords, although its injustice has been denounced both by Lord St. Leonard's and Lord Wensleydale. The directors originally proteated that such a measure " would shake the confidence of the public in aU such stocks ;" they may mow add, " and in the good faith of aU railway boards":- " Sir,-Knowing your willingness to take the side of the oppressed, and not to allow might to overcome right (as the ordinary shareholders can outvote the preference ones), I beg to inform you that just before tho discovery of Redpath's frauds I made an investment in the Great Northern 4J preference stock, and purchased at a premirun. I have never received a farthing dividend, and it does appear unjust to t,ke from me my half-year's dividend to pay the accumulated losses of years, which ought to have been deducted from the ordinary shareholders year by year, as it 18 evident that they have already received larger dividends than they were entitled to. It does seem very unfair that I should bh obliged to pay for an extraordinary loss, and be deprived of participating in any extraordinary profit. " I am one of the many who appointed the chairman in March my proxy, upon receiving the following communicaEon:- * The directors cannot take upon theselres to prcpoee or rupport any Biu which wonud tbrow upon the preference stocks ary porlon o' the loes in question, sad thereby shake the conaddence o Ihe pub:e li aU such stock,.' I am a working man with a family, and the above Eam is part of the savings of many years. "" I am} Sir, your obedient rervant, "Bath, July, 18'57.") C. C. A special meeting of the General Iron Screw Collier Company was held to-day to take into consideration the report of the committee of Bha;reholders appointed the 31st of October last, and the directors' observations upon it. Several alterations in the deed of settlement were approved, and it was resolved to apportion the sum of 56,1441., accuaulations of the funds for depreciation, insurance, &c., up to the 313t of December, 1856 (arising out of the zprofit from the employment of the company's vessels in the transport service during the war), 'as foliov:-10,000. to form the depreciation fund. with a charge henceforth on revenue of 5 per cent. on the coBt of each vessel; 25,0001. the i3uranec "flund, with a charge of 10 per cent, on the value of the ships,; and the re-i nder,amounting, with the accumulations of the last half-year, to about 25,0001., to be divided mong the shareholders,. Considerable, discussion Aose a to the mode of appropriating this sum, the directors wishing it to be applied in reduction of capital, the shareholders preferring the declaration of a bonus of 51. per share. Eventually the proposition of the directors was adopted, and the capital of the company was ordered to be reduced 51. per share,.viz., from 125,0001. to 100,0001. at the Court of Bankruptcy to-day an offer of 2s. 63d. in the pound, in addition to the Las 6d. already paid, in the case of Mr. C. J. Mare, shipbulder, on condition that the, bankruptcy should Sbe annulled, was refused. _
RAILWAY AND MINING SRARE. Tue"da5y ZvOanI. The railway share-market bas been flat at x decline in some descriptions of to. . 1ndian sharms were slightly lower, and Grand Trucnk of Canadahave fallen 11. French shares have been very heavy, and have closed at 5s. to II. below the prices of yesterday. Great fluctuations have taken place in American shares. British mines are quiet, in some cases at an increased price. In miscellaneous shares no change has occurred.
TEE NATIONAL DBBT. (From the London Gsadttc of Tuesday, July 7.) The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury having certified to the Conamissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt that there was no surplus of actual revenue over the actual expenditure of the United Kingdom of Great Brstain and Ireland for the year ended the 31st day of March, 1857, The Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Dabt do hereby give notice, that no sum will be applied by them onA account of the Sinking Fund under the provisions of the Act 10th of George IV., cap. 27, between the Ist day of July, 1857, and the 30th day of September, 1857.

ELECTION COMMITTBES. TheGeneral Committee on Elections yesterdaynominated the follov'ing committees:- LAm-x'.-Mr. C. R. Colvile, Mr. A. Matheson Cinvereess), Viscount Sandon, Major Wortley; chairman, Mr. Robert Ingham. GALWAY.-Mr. J. C. Ewart (Liverpool), Mr. A. W. Kin lake, Lord Lovaine, Mr. H. G. Sturt; chairman, Mr. BATH.-Mr. J. Cheetham, Mr. J. S. Fitzgerald, Lord Galway, Sir H. Verney; chairman, Mr. Horsman. MAYO (COUNTY). The examination of witnesses on behalf of the sitting member was resumed yesterday. Mr. Jordan. who had been examined on Monday, was cross-examined by Ur. E. JAmEs.-Ho stated that he had taken a very active part in the election. In the course of his cross-examination with regard to Cavanagh's ease he asserted that Mr. Carran acted as a partisan of Colonel Higgins, but he was unable to say whether Mr. Curran had ever spoken to Colonel Higgins before the election, and he bad never seen Mgr. Curran in Mayo before. He alho denied that either he or his son had used some of the expre-imns attributed to him by Mr. Cirran. He also sijd that a shot had been fired by Cavanagh, but that he had not looked for it. He saw the resolution sail to have been tigned by the Bishops at Castlebar when he was in company with Dr. M'Grean. The placard in which the resolution was published was drawn up by Dr. M'Grean. Some priests, Green and Cahill, were present. The priests made an ob. jection to its being published, but Atr. Sheridan, Dr. M'Grean, and himse'lf, as the frlends of Messrs. Moore and Palmer, insisted on having it published. He could not teU who produced the manuscript of the resolution. He saw it on the table. A capy of it was made and a copy sent to the press for a plazard. Ho supposed 200 were printed, of which he took aboat a dozen. Tli took place less thau a week before the nomination. Mr. Sheridan was Mr. Moore's agent, but not a paid agent. Witness informed Mr.Haligan, thcurate,of theresolution. He produced two of the placards in Bohola, and the rest he behieved remained in his pocket. He did not think the resolntion had produced much effect on the people. By Colonel 1NORTH.-The document he saw lying on the table was interlined. Cross-examination continued.-He had never seen the resolation since. There were perhaps 700 people outside the chapel,to whomhereadtheresolution. Hedidnotremember any arrangement being made at the meeting at -which the placard was sent to be printed that it should be forwarded to every parish priert. He had not heard that a copy was sent to every parish priest. M'Nicholas was the priest and Haligan the curate at Bohola. He did not tell M'Nicholas of the resolution, more than the rest of the public. He believed there was a meeting of the priests at Castlebar, and that they obected to the publication of the resolution unlesq Dr. RHale's consent was first obtained. He and Mr. Sheridan and Dr. MGrean insisted on its publication. The witness was then cross-examined with reference to Dunleary, who, he said, was at his house the night before he was taken into Swineford, together with some other freeholders. He went to bed, and therefore did not see what was going on. Danleary was a tenant of his, and also of Mr. Taaffo's. Father Curly was at the nomination in a conspicuous place. Be-examined by Mr. KA.RsLAxE.-He had employed Cavanagh, and as he felt an interest in him he did not wish the complaint against him to be ursued. On the occasion when he saw the resolution he dit not meet the priests by appointment. It was not a formal meeting. He saw that placard (produced) before the placard containing the reso. lution was pubished. This was a placard issued by Colonel Higgins's party. He did not see the voters at his hoose becausa he did nct wish to know how they were treated. They might have left the house if they had wished; they had asked to be allowed to go there for protection. Cavanagh never denied that he had fired a shot. Matthew Henry Jordan, the son of the last witness and a freeholder, gave evidence as to the same facts as his father, whose evidence he corroborated. Whern he saw Danleary going into the Court-house, he said, there were two magis. trates before and two behind him, and he was put on the bench by the side of the deputy-sheriff. Danleary told him that if he did not vote for Colonel Higgins he would be turned out of his land, and he voted for Higgins and Moore. In ansvwer to Colonel NosevT, the witness, whose appearance was rather youthful, said he had voted himself, Why, he had seen people vote who were only 13 years old. (laughter.) Examination continued.-Mr. Strickland, the magistrate, brought up voters for Colonel Higgins to the polL On cross-examination by Mr. O'-ALEnaY, the witness said there were not more than five or six voters in the house the night before they went to Swineford. He did not see them eat or drink anythimg. He let in one voter named Kelly at about 12 o'clock at night. Dunleary was half drank or tipsy before he was taken to the house. Some of the voters had gone to bed, and some were smoking when he left them. Carr, a paid agent of Captain Palmer, was with thevoters. Ho did not carry a stick during the election, nor a stone, nor a pistol. (Laughter.) He did not carry a stiok for fear he might strikesome one with it. (Laughter.) When the water was thrownoutofthehotelat Swineford towards Mr. Mloore there was not more than one priest with him. Mr. Moore toldthe peopleatSwineford not to strikea blow when he was spoken to by Mr. Curran. Re-examined by Mr. BUCHnAXA..-Captain Brabazon, the deputy.sheriff spoke to the voters near him during the poling. Colonel Craig, examined by Mr. KARsLAXE, said he was an old friend of Captain Palmer, and was staying with him on a visit during his canvass. Castlebar was particularly uiet during the nomination. On Monday, the first day of tne polling, he accompanied Mr. Ormsby and a Protestant clergyman to Swineford. The town was very quiet for Ireland. Hoea-w no aeto of violonoc *oamitted, alihough he was about the town all day. After the pong was closed he saw a troop of Royals riding up and down the street at some imaginary mob, which they succeeded in clearing. He saw no reason or cause for their interference. One man was ridden over by the mob. He believed Mr. Cnrran was with the Dragoons. They continued clearing tho streets for about a quarter of an hour. No resistance was made to them. The infantry were drawn up by the market-place. He had once had to act against a crowd in Exeter, and he had been caled out in Ireland. He certainly saw nothing to justify the interference of the troops. He had seen other Irish elections. The witness was not cross-examined. M-r. Mullgan, examined by Mr. M. Sm, said he was a shopkeeper and distributor of stamps at Swineford, and had been canvassed by Colonel Higgins and Captain Brabazon. Mr. O'ALLEY objected to evidence being received which had not been opened by his learned friend, and was not an answer to any part of the petitioner's case. Mdr. M. SmrTx submitted that this evidence was admissible, inasmuch as it was part of his case that if any riot had occurred it had been caused by partiality and partisan. ship on the part of the sheriff and the deputy-sheriff. The CosmirrgE held that evidence with regard to Cap. tain Brabazon after, his appointment as deputy-sheriff was admissible, but not evidence as to what ho kad done previous to his appointment. Mr. M. SErTH said, he proposed to show that Captain Brabazon had promised to indemnify a voter from any consequences that might result to him in consequence of his voting if he would vote for Colonel Higgins. Examination continued.-On the Sunday before the poUing Captain Brabazon called on him. Mr. O'MALLZY objected to evldenee being given as to Captain Brabazon's acts not done in his character of deputysheriff; but The ComMrIrEE overruled the objection. Examination continued. -He had received a certain letter to which Captain Brabazon had alluded. (The letter from CaptainBrabazon was road, and guaranteed the witness from all loss which he might sustain in consequence of his vote, if he voted at the ensuing election.) He thought he could not vote without losing his situation, and subjecting him. self to a penalty. On the Monday morning he again saw Captain Brabazon, and said he could not vote. Captain Brabazon said, " Very well; that puts an end to the friendship between you and I." Captain Brabazon was his landlord. Witness did not vote at all, and wrote an explanation to Captain Brabazon. On May 30th he received a letter from Captain Brabazon. Mfr. O'iMLLEY objected to that letter being read, and The CommsTTrrg refused to receive it, as it was too far removed from the election. Lord John Browne, examined by Mr. SAcrr, said he lived at Westport, in the county of Mayo, and took an active pxrt at the last election for Captain Palmer. He was a magistrate and applied for a deputation to act during the election, but the Righ Sheriff refused to accede to his application. He believed it was usual iii Ireland to give deputations to gentlemen on either side, but he believed that at this election deputations wore given to Colonel Higgins's supporters alone. The proceedsgrat the nomination were exceedingly quiet. A number of Mr. Palmer's and Mr. Hlggins's supporters were, in fact, standing outside the Court-house 3oksg at a state of things utterly unheard of before in the courty. Mr. Sharkie was near the High Sheriff, and attracted his attention by appearing very active in cheering Colonel Higgins's suppor'ters. He remained at Captain Palmer's until the Saturday, when he went to Westport. Before the nomin-tion he hi canvassed for Captain Palmer. There was a small mob, hardly deserving the name, of Colonel Higginss supporters, who were kept in check by Captain Palmer's tenantry, but they shoved their feeling by throwing mud and stones. He had written to the High lSheriff and to the Government on the subject of having the military present, and military were sent. He was in the polling-booth at Westport on the Monday and Tuesday. There vwas a mob, consisting chiefly of women and children, hooting Moore's and Palmer's voters and cheering those of Higgins. He once opened his lips, bat was instantly called to order by the deputy-sheriff There was a very full poling of the voters. On the second day be went to Castlebar, and tho road and the towa were perfectly quiet. He saw the High Sheri& with the Dragoons, escorting voters to the Court-house. There never was a coutested election In Mayo as which voters for the unpopular candidate had not to be escortedtothe polL That was invariably the case. Some voters who had promised to vote for Mfoore and Palmer were brought up by the sheriff. and the sheriff said he would commit any one to gaol who dared to speak to voters under his charge. Between 12 and 1 on Wednesday morning he arrived at Ballinrobe. The town was perfectly quiet. A large force of police was there. He remained part of the day on Wednesday, and it was U qutet as on an ordinary day. From all he had heard and seen, there never was an election so quiet. It was a very mild affair. Cronsexamined by Mr. E. JA:ss.-He was present at a meeting with two or thre priests before the election, when an arrangement was made for an interchange of support between Mr. Palmer and Mr. Moore. He did nob think Dr. M!dale's name was mentioned. The priests asked what support Mr. Palmer's friends would give Mr. Moore If they supported Mr. Palmer. He had seenthe placard containing the resolution of the Bishops 'buthe could not say whether it was before or after that meeting. He did not understand that the priests had any authority to speak in the name of the whole priesthood, All the respectable people in the barony with whom he was connected were in favoar of }loore and Palmer, and only tbe loweat of the aow were in favour Of Colonel Higgins. The result was that Colonel Hliggins polled only 17 votes in that barony. M1r. JlAmsxs-fave o made any arraugement to istand for the county if Mlr. V[oore'rould be unuseated?? Witness.-lf ha should be unseated I shal do my best to return him again, I think I am bound to do so. If he sbould be uanabole to standl again I do not know what I may do amaProtestant. I differ from thepriests in poltics entirely. If Colonel Higgins had the support of the counatry gentlemen as a body he WOUld unquestionably be able to ca2ry an election a'alnst the priests. Re-examined.-As Ear as my experience goes the intere3t of the priests in Mayo has dunlnished to a degree-extremely. There was a complaint made by the priete at the interview of which I have spoken that Mr. Moore bad not come down or written as he had promised. The committee adjoUrned untithis morning. MA.IDSTONE. The committee reassembled this mornilg at 11 o'cloC% Mr. G. A. Hamilton in the chair. Mr. Serjeant PIGOTT continued his address on behalf of the sitting members. He denied that any satisfactory proof of agency had been established, and said he was prepared with evidence, even if the committee held the agency to bs proved, to rebut the whole of the allegations of the witneEEes called on behalf of the petitioners. He believed that no contest in Maidstone had ever been conducted upon purer pri-.ciples, and he urged that there never was a weaker case of bribery attempted to be established. Not one shillng had ever pased on account of a vote, and the only evidence adduced had Te. ference to idle and indistinct conversations. The facts spoken to were of so extraordinary a nature that no committee could credit them, and he believed he should he able to give them n distinct contradiction by respectable and satisfactory witnesses. With regard to the question of agency he sabmitted that thero was no proof that any of the persons wvho were alleged to have promised a consideration fora vote wvere the boIS4JIcSJ accredited agents of the sitting George Slms Marley was then examined at considerable length. He denied theassertion of awitness named Morris~, that he bad had, either directly or indirectly, promised him money for his vote on behalf of Messrs. Hope and Scott. On the contrary, believing thatMorris intendedto lay a trap for him, when he called upon Morris he took aman named Hartnup with him, whom he placed beneath the window to listen to their conv rsation. He also denied havin promised money to two voters, named Turner and Lamb. John Hartnup-was then called, and corroborated Marleys statement that no offer of money had been made to Morris but contradicted him in other points. He had not, he said, been placed beneath a window for the purpose of overhearing the conversation, but hadaccompanmedMarley direct to the door, and everything had been-open and straightforward. If Marley had swor that hecrouched beneath the window he hadl told a direct untruth. Evidence was then called to contradict the'allegations of other witnesses on the part of the petitioners. Mr. Monckton, town-clerk of Maidstone, denied that he had eser sanctioned the sending of a letter to one of his tenanus named Lower just before the election threatenin' him with a distress in case the arrears of rent were-not pa' up, nor had he consented to forego his claim to the arrears if Lower would vote for Messrs. Hope and Scott. He had never received the arrears from any other person, but he considered Lower to be liable, and should insu on pay. ment. Joseph Parton, miller, of Maidstone, was then called, and deposed to having had a voter named Dallage in his employ. ment during the election. He had never told him that he would receive 5l. if he voted for Hope and Scott. In cross-examination, the witness said he had never used the tlightest means to influence any voter in his employment, but he had discharged a man named Lee last Saturday because he had come up to London to give evldence before the committee upon a Speaker's warrant. He dischargedhimonthe groundthat he hadabsentedhimself without permission. Ljee had told his foreman early on Saturday morning that he would be absent in consequence of having received a Speaker's warrant. He had heard on Saturday before he discharged the man that he had given evidence in corroboration of a pOrtion of Dullage's state- The CHAiR Ar said, the committeo were of opinion that Parton had acted with extreme harshness and in a most unjustifiable manner, and they would consider whether it was not their daty to report the mattr to the House as a breach of privilege. The Committee adjourned shortly before 4 o'clock until this day. BURY. At the reassemblingof the committee yesterday morning, James Jones, a moulder, gave evidence conarmatory of the statement made byJohn Moorhouse on the previous day. A question having arisen upon an objection taken by Mr. MONss, The Co rrrrzx unanlmously decided that Moorhonse's was a caso not of bribery, bat simply of abduaction. Jesse Kay, landlord of the Church Inn, Bary, stated that on the Thursday evening before the election, Mr. T. L. Openshaw and a man named Pennington engaged a room in bis house as a committee-room for Mr. Philips, for which they said that they would pay anything he pleased to charge. The room was occupied until Saturday night, and he had charged 5l. for it. but had not been paid. On the Thursday evening Mr. Philips came and looked at the room. Hie supplied drink to the amount of about six gineas to the order of George Booth and Pennington, to e given, as he said, to non-electors, men who rwere hunting aboat. and so on. In cross examination he said that when he let the room he did so on the express condition that it should not influence his vote. The wife of this witness, Sarah Kay, was called, and examined at some length by Mr. ROIYWELL, but no aduditional information was obtained from her. Mr. BODWB1n then submitted that he was now in aposi. tioatoBgive evidence of what occurred In this comnuittee room at the Church Inn. Mr. Moxx contended that as yet there was before the committee no sufficient proof of the agency of any of the persons seen at the Church Inn. The room having been cleared, The Committee consalted for some time, and ultimately postoned their decision of the question until this day. William Pennington, a moulder and a non-elector, was examined as to the non-elector canvass and the payment of watchers, but nothing could be elicited from him. In crossexamination he stated that Mr. Whitehead, the solicitor to the petition, and his clerk, a Mr. Jones, bad promised to give him 501., pay his expenses to London, and allow him 11. a-day while he was there if he would give such evidence s would unseat Mr. Philipos. In order to cure them of tempting poor men, he came to London and sawr Mr. Coppockc, who said that what had been promised him in Bury should be performed. To contradict this statement hrr. JErS called Mr. Coppock and Mr. Jones, who denied the expression attributed to them by the witness, and Mr. Whitehead, who denied that he offered Pennington any money for his evidence, but stated that Pennington having told him that he could give information which was worth 501. he told him thathe should have any sum up to that amount that his information might be worth, and sent him to London to see Mr. Coppock. He only treated with Pennington for information, ani not for evidence. The committee adjourned soon after half-past 3 o'clock. OXFORD (CITY). At the sitting of the committee, Mr. WusuBY addressed them on the part of the sitting member, Mr. Neate, and submitted that the case of the petitioner had resolved itself into a question of scratiny, as no evidence had been given to fix upon Mr. Neate any of the charges of bribery and treating contained in the petition. Whatever acts might have been committed by Mr. Neate's supporters, no act of bribery or treating had been done with his knowledge or consent. With regard to tho number of messengers employed by Mr. Neate, he would remind the committee that they were not all employed at the same time, but distributed over different days, and that upwards of 100 of the constituency of the city were freemen. The learned counsel then commented upon the evidence which had been addaced in support of the petition, and in conclusion stated that he would caU gentlemen of station and character belonging to the city who would deny that any bribery and treating had been practised by the sitting member, and that Mr. Neate himself would tell them that if any act or acts of bribery and corraption had taken place he was entirely ignorant of them. When that evidence had been laid before the committee, he hoped they would have no difficulty in declaring Mr. Neate duly elected. Mr. C. A. Green, an auctioneer at Oxford and an agent of Sr. lTeate, was examined by Mr. VAUGE: RlICEAaDS, and stated that a committee had been formed for the support of Mr. Neate, of which he and Mr, Speirs. Mr. Freeman, and Mr. Turner were members; that they held a meeting at the Roebuck on the 18th of March, when it was agreed that no payment should be made without the consent of three members of the committee. He, and he believed the other agents of Mr. Neate also, had acted upon that resolation. They engaged 10 inspectors and 30 poll clerks, besides a number of writers. There were 10 polling-booths and also district committeerooms, and he did not think five messengers for each booth and each committee-room at al too large an allowance. The number of men employed in carrying placards was about 2ha, and on the day of the election 50. They would not have been able to get through the work of the election unlessthey had been aIso assisted by volunteers. He put up a notice at the Roebuck after the election that the messengers would be paid there. The men who claimed payment went iato the room separately, and a book was referred to in order to ascertain the services they had rendered. In eiery case he found that the men had done the work for which they had been engaged. No one wa3 asked whether he had voted or how ho had voted. The men gave receipts as they wore paid. He never paid anything except to those men who had been engaged during the cleotion. He never paid even for a glass of beer for a voter. Mr. Greenwood was not on Mr. Neate's committee. On cross-examination by Mr. Serjeant PBo'r, the witness said that Mr. Greenwood was on Mr. Langston's committee, and no doubt supported Mr. Neate. He heard that only 28 messengers were emploved by tir. Cardwell. Some of Mr. Neate's messengers were paid 5s. and some 3s. 9d. a-day. Some were employed for nin days, and some for not more than one day. There was a list (produced) of 100 persons whohad been employed as messengers by Mr. Neato's committee, maklng up the total number empioyed en behalf of Mr. leate, including pol-clerks, placard benrers, &c, to about 200. Richard Goatley, a comio singer who attended harmonic meetings was paid 31. for posting bills. MSr. George Roberson, M.A, of Lincoln Collego, stated that he had volunteered his services to Mir. Nleate, and was present at the Roebuck during the payment of the messengers, and saw that they showed thsat bon4 de services had been rendered beforo they were paid. He did not think a larger number had been employea than was necessay. Mr.Thomas Boddington, tho ehairman of Ar. Neato's committeo, stated that abont 100 circula were sent to various people, for whom there was no vacancy as poll- clerk,, asldng them it they would be employed as met. sergers. hir. Neate, ihe sitting member, wras then examined by. 3Mr. WNeSbY.-Hesait that he annonoed his intention to itsnd for the city about the 10th ot March, at a lublic rneeting at tEe Town-hall He afterwards atten ed a private meeting of his friends, at which the probable- expense of the election was discuased. It was stated th-t it would amount to SOO. or 1,00., but he said he should not. spend more than 00., and he left the city on the Saturlay. intending to resign. on the Monday following he foand that his friends had got up a requidtion to him to stand, to which he acceded. He repeated, however, that he would not pay more than 50o!.,ana his friends saidl " that it shQul4 not cost him that.' He remembered the meetings at the Horse and Jockey and the Rine's Head, and a room had been hired for him to address the electors at Grace's Hlotel. He did not attend a meetine at the Horse and Jockey on the 24th of March. On the Wednesdayor Thursday before the nomination he obtained the use of the Tawn-hall to address the electors. He believed that Mr. Greenrood accompanied him once in Jib 4arriage on his canvss, -bat Mr. Greenwood was noton his committee, nor was he e - plo3ed by him in any way in reference to the election. - HE once saw Mr. Greenaood in his committeeoroom, and told him in a good.humoured way that he ought not to be there. Re believed that Mr. Greenwood was a member of Mr. Langston'scommitteo He never authorIzed Mr. Greenwood to bring up voters for him from Abingdon, nor to give breafast tohvtersatAbingdon He had not sanctioned nor ade himslf in any way responsible for It. to lquor had ever been ordered by him ,nor with his sanction or authoity, either at the Kaidenead, the Haine's Head, or the Horse and Jockey. When he was canvassug with Mr. Freeman andl others at the Batchera' Arms he remembered that they had some luncheon, for whichone of the partypaid. The amount might perhaps be Is. 6d. He did not offer ale to the landlord, or any one else, to vote for him. In cross-examinationj,yl Mr. Serjuant PIGOTT, Mr. NTeate said he had not been consulted with regard to the employmaent of messengers, nor did he know how many were em. ployed. He gave general directions not to employ loo mnany. Mr. GreenwoDd was a memuber of the Town-counciL. This evidence concluded the cas on behalf of the sitting member. Hz. V.

STATE OF TADE. i MANCHESTER, Ju.Y u 7 The sellers of cloth report a very flat day, with prices nominally the same as last week, though much difficelty has been experienced in effecting sales at sach rates. The demand for India has been for the better qualities3 of 40-inch shirtings, but lower quaUties of these goods and of *acconets and madapolams have been rather neglected. In fact, the market has to-day felt the full effect of the late unfavourable news respecting the disaffection which has shown itself among the native troops, and buyers have'exhibited great caution. Longeloths and T-cloth3 continue ia moderate request. For yarns there has been a stronger market than for cloths, a good deal of business hav'mg bee dono for Germany in moEt icnds of water and mule twist, but more especidally 12's to 24's water, and some fair sales having been effected in 40's to 60's mule for India, and in 8's to 24's water twist for the Mediterranean. Prices generally may be reported at -d. per lb advance on the rates of last Taesday, the principal cause being the advance of cotton to the amount of {c. in the Anerican mar1-ets. Some stoppages bave been reported in the trade, of which eight have taken place at Blackburn. Of these, however, oniy three are supposed to be final suspensions, and the liabiities are not large. The firms in question were spinners and manufacturers. Four of them are said to be stoppages to effect changes in partnership, and one is in temporary difficulties which there is some hope may be arranged. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report " There has been a good demand for the better qualities of 40-inch shirtings, and for spots and brocades for China, since the arrival of the last Overland Mail, and prices are slightly in favour of producers. The lower qualities of shirtings, jacconets, and madapollams,-Indeed, all India goods, are m less request; but,as stocks are light, and cotton still tending upwards, there is no desire to push sales, and consequently there is no change in prices to notice. Longc'otbs and T-cloths are still in good demand at last week s quotations." MTessrs. George Fraser, Son, and Co., report:- '"There is no material change to-day in our market, which is very firac for beth goods and yarns, and which contiouss to maintain the same hardenlng tendency in prices as visible for the past fewv weeks." LEEDS, JuLy 7. The woollen cloth market has presented a fair, steady spect this morning. There was not a very large number of buyers in the cloth halls, bat they purchased a -fall average amount of cloth, mostly to make up stocks, wit} some few lots for the autumn trade. Wools are withott' change; they are firm in price. I HUDDERSFIELD, JULy 7. The demand for woollen goods has rather improved, and the trade wears a more encoaraging aspect in nearly eery department. There have been many buyers this morning, and some of them have purchased largely. The better kints of goods are in most demand, but there are some bulky oiders for other kinds for shipping. The demand for wool is brsL-, and prices are firm.
VOoSOLIDATION OF STATUTES.-The Lord lChan. cellor has laid on the table of the House of Lords several Bilsconsolidatin- and amending various branches of;tbe statute law of hngland. These Bills include tho law of lIrceny, offences against the person, the laws relating to deer, game, and rabbits, the law relating to accessories and abettors of indictable offenees, ooinage offences, for&ery, malicious injury to property, and the law of libel. In the law of libel no alteration has been made, bat a few words are introduced into clause I in order to easy out the obvious intention of the clause in the Act 6th and 7th of Victoria. cap. 96, and to prevent the evasion of its provislons. It has been extended to threats to cause libelstobe publsheKd, and to libels on the dead. The "Offences a'ainst the Person" BiU contains certain amendments, aiI of which were carefully considered and approved by a committee of tho House of Lords in 183. AI attempts to commit murder are made felony, and punishable with seven years of penal sernitude. Section 34 has been framed in the hope that it may cheek the novel form of robbery caed " garotte " robbery, the offence being declared felony, and punishable with penal servitude for lifo. Attempts to pro. cure abortion wlli be punishable In the caeA of the womrn a3 well as the man, where she is pregnant. The punishment of death is again annexed to the abominable crimes of sodomy and bestality.

LAW BRPO1T. COURT OF CEANCERYOB, JCOLN's-iNN, JULY 7. rV BAVTRTrPrrlv EX PARThE lOTTlFRTVY Tq DaflA1TnlnRvP VWOJM2 MLC LORDS JUSTCEOM of ArrE&T.) Mr.IsACON (in answer to a question from the Bench) said, that the petitioner declined to try the validity of the bank-.. 2uptcy, vwhich course had been proposed. Mr. CAIRNS asked for.tho costs of the appeal, which, he said, would doubtless be paid by the parties who had so far speculated as to seek the Judgment of this Court'against the decision of the learned Commissioner; the petition having been presentcd under the power of attorney execated by the bankrupt before his departure for America, where he now remained. Their LoBDsmHs directed that the deposit paid on the presentation of tha petition, 201., should be paid to the assignees towards their costs, the remnainder to come out of the estate. Mr. Wellington Cooper appeared with Mr. Bacon; Mr. A&spinall (of the common law bar) was on the same side as MIr. Cairns. WYLLIE V. GREEN. This was a motion calling upon the Sheriff of Warwick. shire to show cause why an attachment should not be issued against him. The facts werethat, by an order, dated January 22,1857, the defendant George Joseph Green, a trustee, was ordered before thel2thof Marchtopayinto court a sumof 1671.10,3. 6d., the balance of 5441. 4s., found to be remaining in his hands by the certificate of the chief-clerk, dated August 9, 1856. A copy of this order was duly served upon Mr. Green, bet upon his failing to obey it a writ of attachment was on the 4th of March, 1857, issued against hin, and the nature of the transaction which led to its issuing was endorsed upon the writ itself. The writ was sent down to the Sheriff of Warwicirshire, who made the following return:- " I bhmbly certify that G J. Green, in the annexed writ mentfoned, bsad before the delivery of the said writ to me. pesrentid a petition to the ounty Court of Warwickshire, bolden at Blrwin5ham. under, and according to the PIroisiona of the statutea made ant paswel in that i'ebalf, and ruch retition ha ving been ltId in fhe said court p-otection ha4, before the delivery of the writ to me, been. by virtue of the said states, given to the said G.

J. drecn, as by suah writ I an conmrssded. The answer of Henry Spencer LUCY, Eoq., Shesff." ln consequence of this returzn, by an order, dated the 11th of Jtune, 1857, it wvas ordered that the sheriff show cause, on thc first seal day in the sitting, after Trinity Term, why he should not be committed to the Queen's prison for rnot having taken the defendant G. J. Green on the said attachm ent. Mr. BACON and Mr. QuAlr (of the common law bar) contended that the sheriff was quite correct in the course he had pursued. They referred to the statutes 5 and 6 Victoria, c. 116; 7 and S Victoria, c. 70 and c. 96; and 10 and 11 Vicoria, c. 102, which severally gave, both under an interim and a final order of a competent court, protection against arrest whether upon process for debt or contempt. Mr. TERRELL and Mr. M.KInRR (of the common lawv bar), the former leaving the argument to Mr. Kerr, appeared for the plaintif, and argued that the sheriff had ien wrong and ought to be attached. Ho relied upon the statutes and raised three points, contending that the protection given to the debtor was confined to protection from debts properly so called, and not mere equitable demands. First, therefore, that debt only being dealt with, no precess was evaded or barred unless the Court should hold that process issuing from the Exchequer, or Crown process, or even criminal process, could avail, for the word process was equally applicable to alL The whole mattor on the statutes related to the relative position of debtor and creditor. Secondly, that the Court in this case had nothing to do with the final order mentioned in the Acts of Parliament, for the interim order had alono been pronounced at the time of tle return of the sheriff. And thirdly, that the return was bad, for it did not say whether the protection consisted of a Enal or an interim order, which it should have done. The attachment ought to issue against the sheriff. Mr. Bacon was not called upon to reply. The learned counsel cited several cases, and among them Beavan v. Walker" (12 Common Bench Rleports, 480); "Phllips v. Pickford," Oth volume of the same reports. 459; ann" The Queen v. Eemsworth," in the 3d volume of the same reports, 745. Lord Justice KNIGIhT BRUCE said, that he thought the sheriffw as right. It was not an immaterialfct in this case that a final order had been granted, though that final order was not granted previously to the sheriff's return, the delivery and return of the writ having beenboth intermediate between the interim and the final order. The domand, ia respect of which the process issued, was a demuand founded on and arising out of contract wholly and simply. A trustee had duly received monoy, and being called upon to account had failed to &chargo hinlf, and the order being made in this court was in the forn that the trustee should pay the money into court, in order that it might be paid to the proper parties entitled to it. The question was, whother the interim order 'was not a protection against such an attachmient under the statutes. His Lordship said, "tho statutes," because he was of opinion that all the statutes must be taken together. And, taking them all together, he thought that the sound construction of thoir provisions was that sueh a desand as the present was one against which the interim order was intended for a protection. This return was, therefore, one which the Court could not dis- turb. Lord Justice TURnR said, that he was of the same opinion. He thought that the provision in the 7th and 8th of Victoria, c. 06, was not confined to legal debts, but ap. plied to equitable debts also. It was said that, the case was governed by the case of " Beavan v. Walker;" bat in that case the debt arose. on tort, whereas the present arose strictly on contract. He thought it was the intention of the statutes that the protoction should apply to all the debts in the schedule, and that the satme protectionawhich was given by the final order should be given by the interim .order. The only difficulty which his Lordship felt arose out of the fact that the 26th section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria referred ecpecially to process for contempt; but he thought that that seection must bo considered simply as explanatory of the former Act, and not as implying that there wasany omission in thatAct. The costs of all parties must come out of the estate in court. INNES V. MITCseELL. This was an appeal from an order of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, dismissing a motion in this case. It was fully reported in eVie Tiacs, both on the motion and on the hearing of the demurrer. An order ex partE had been obtained for service of a copy of the bill upon parties out of the jurisdiction, and his Honour refused to discharge that order. Mr. Bolt, Mr. Baily, and Mr. Cotton were for the appeal; Mr. Anderson and Mr. A. B. Miller in support of the order of the Vice-Chancellor. ar. ROLT was heard in roply. Lord Justice KNICITT BRUCE considered the order of the Vice-Chancellor perfectly correct, and therefore dismissed the appeal. Lord Justice TuRxEBt entertained much doubt, but considered he mst be wrong in his doubt, seeihg that both his learned brother and the Vico Chancelor agreed inopiion. No costs would be given.

HASTINGS moved in this case on the answer forpayment into court of 1,4721. under these circumstance. In the year 1855 Mr. Hayward, the defendnnt, was the sole agent for the company for the sale of soap, and by an agreernent dated the 31st of March, 1856, he agreed with the company, represented by certain directors, that he wonld obtain orders upon a stated commission, the defendant agreeing to render an account weekly and oay to the board of directors ortheirbankers alsunms received byhim as their agent. In the agreement there was a clause that he should payforhisownoffices, clerks, &c.,andexpensesincident to the agency, and there was a proviso that in cAse the directors sholcd at any timie b desirous to diefcnanrge the defendant it shouald be lawfual for the hoard of directors, esthpr at once or with six calcendar months' previous notice to do so, provied nevertheless that, if such agreemend shonld he deterinmined by the directors without such six months' notice, thoy should pay to the defendant f001. in lien of such notice. The comTmision oset being paid to the defendant under his atgreement, he, after applications made, deducteid the amount appearing to him to he due, and remitthe bbala6cedto thedirectors. Onctheah of January, 185, th defendant received notice froin the chairman of their intention to determine the agreement, which was rephe ed to byteis solicitors, Messrs. 6.aunce, giving notice that he should retain al moneys until thnm som was suffiiciet to cover tho sums duo, with the 5001. componsatlon. On tho 30th of March, 1857, the company filed a hill, and got an injunctiorn to restrain the defendant from colecting or handiLg over orders to others. The defendant put in his answer on the 10th of June last, wbereby he stated that the comIpany were, in fact, dissolved under the provisIons of their deed, and all the property sold for 8,0001. before the bill was filed, and were therefore incapable of suing as such, and claiming 6041. as his share in the proceeds of the sale, in respect of 1,400 shares which beheld. The answer admitted the rieceipt of 1,4351. s. 7d., blt from that sum he claimed a right to deduct two sums of 1001. each for cammis5sion, for rent of offices, and a stand at the Crystal Palace, and for advertisements, and 5001. for compensation in having beenx discharVe without six months' notice under the agreement, and to41g as is share of the 8,0001., and a sum representing a nuarantee fuind. the. GLAssE and w r. HASTINGS now moved for the payment into court of the 1,4351. s 7d. admitted by the answer to be in the defendant's possession, not disputing the two sums of 1001. for commission, &-c.

With regard to the 500o1., the language of the agreement of ly referred to a deterinai. of the agreement, not a discbarge of the defendant. M~E. company, though disposed of, existed until the whole aff4tirs were wound up, to preserve the rights of the shareholders, not to carry on business ; and the moment i.t was dissolved every particle of property was to be sold, And it was sold.

With respect to the 6041., as the share of' the 8,0001., it was utterly untenable, for neither was the, paidsnt courtam on o bfore fathert cosdrtofnul. Thfat were -M fLloIW i-Iga 183H 5ir Itihard ls4ttg ~rug4 tro Cbarlotte Ma0on and Charles Mason a lease of the stable. yard called the Running Horse Livery-yard, situate on tho north side of Piccadilly, for 30 years, from December 25, 1834. In Marcb, 1835, Charlotte and Charles Mason assigned the above premises to the defendant Gray by way of nmortgage, in order to secure 8931. 8s. 10d. and interest. In 1836 Charlotte and Charles Mason assigned the premises to Wiliam Mason for the residue of the term of 30 years, Mubjeot to the mortgage to Gray, and in March, 1838, William Mason assigned the premises to the plaintiff by way of mortgage to secure 2,0001. and interest. InOctober, 1840, William MIason was adjudged a bankrupt, and in the ensuing December the defendant Gray obtained possession by ejectment of the mortgaged property, and it was agreed thereupon between him nd Charles Mason that the latter sbould occupy the premises at a rent of 3601. ln. August, 1843, Gray distrained for arrears of rent to tbe amount of 7251., and eeized the carriages and horses of several gentlemen then at livery on the beforementioned premises. The owners of the carriages and horses so seized having threatened Gray with proceedings at law to recover their property, he withdrew his distress exceptas to the tenant's goods and cbattels, and in consequence of such withdrawal he recovered no more than the sum of 3621. 6s. in respect of the arrears of rent due to lim, leaving 3621. 14s. of such arrears unpaid. In June, 1855, the plaintiffi instituted this suit to redeem the firt mortgage, and in December last the usual decree was made. In taking the accounts the Chief Clerk charged the defendant Gray with the sum of 3621. 14s., and certified that if the Court should be of opinion that Gray ought not to be charged with such sum, then there was due to him in respect of his mortgage the sum of 7301. 16s. 8d. The question was whether the defendant Gray was to be charged with the sum of 3621. 14s. as a sum which, hut for his wilful neglect and default, he might have received. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Anzphlett were for the plaintiff and Mr. Malins and Mr. Savage for the defendant. The VIcE-CHANcOLOR said it was admitted that the defendant Gray, who was the mortgagee in possession, was not bound to distrain; but then it was said that, having distrained, he was bound to defend the actions of replevin with whtch he was threatened. If, however, after the notices he had received, he had proceeded to try the question of his right to distrain the carriages and horses which he had seized, and had failed, he would not have been entitled to add to his mortgage debt the costs which he would thereby have incurred. But the question here was not between a landlord and a tenant, but whether a mortgagee was bound to seize property which he knew did not belong to the tenant in possession, and apply it in satisfaction of his rent. The true doctrine of the Court was that a mortgageein possession of themortgagof'spropertywasbound to use it as he would use his own property. In this case the defendant put in a distress, but on receiving notice that some of the property which he had distrained did not belong to his tanant, and on being threatened with legal proceedings if he did not restore such property, he declined to embark in the litigation, and in doing so did what ever yprudent man would have done. This was not a case in which the defendant should be charged with the sum of 3621.14s. as a sum which, but for his wilful neglect and defatult, he might have received, and there would therefore be the usual decree. FAREBROTHER V. GIJSON. The question raised in this cause, and upon a petition pre sented by Mr. Gibson, arose in respect of property sold at auction-No. 8, New Coventry-street, and described as beirg " in the occupation of the Catholic Law and General Insurance Company, under a lease for a term, of which ten and a half years were unexpired at Ladyday, 1856, at a rent of 3501. per annum; the landlord insures ; the leEsees have right of pre-emption during the last three months of the term for the 6um of 8,7501." It was objected on tho part of Messrs. Melvile and others, the purchasers, that this description implied that the insurance company were the lesees; but the fact was 'that Dr. Magee, Dr. Morris, and Mr. William Norris, three trustees of the company, were lessees; and it was in evidence on the part of the defendant Gibson, the vendor, that Messrs. Melville and Co. had been verbally informed of the fact prior to the sale. The purchase money was 3,6001. Mr. Wigram and Mr. Hislop Clarke were for the plaintiffs, the auctioneers, who were mere stakeholders of tbe deposit paid by the purchaser at the sale; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Emrskino were for the defendant Gibson, the vendor; and Mr. Malinms and Mr. Prendergast for the purchasers. The VICE-CM%NCELLOIL thought that if the question had turned on the alleged misdescription in tho particulars merely, the objection of the purchasers must have failed; but he considered it to have been proved that the purchasers bad, previous to the sale, been informed of the fact that the lease was not to the company, but to individual leEsees The decree must therefore be for specific performance, with costs. (Before Vice-Ohanscor Sir-W. P. WOOD.) BE TnE iLRRICwEN MfES COmPANY EX PARTE LIBRI. This was a motion on behalf of the official manager that Mr. Libri, struck off the list of contributories of the abovenamed company in chambers in respect of 900 shares, might be settled on the list for that amount. The name of Mr. Libri bad been excluded from the list of contributories by the chief clerk on the 5th of August, 1856, in chambers. An application was made by the official manager to have Mr. Libri 3ncluded upon the list, and the parties attended in chambers upon the 15th of December, 186, but no alteration was made in the list, and the name of Mr. Libri remained excluded. A further application was made by the official manager on the 21st of March, but with the same result. Under these circumstances the official manager now moved that the name of Mr. Libri might be included upon the list of contributories. Mr. ROLT and Mr. ROXBURGHI, in support of the motion, contended that the chief clerk had no jurisdiction to settle the list ander tie Winding-np Act. The jurisdiction of the Master in Chancery under the Winding-up Acts was statutory, and had been transferred to the judge, who must certify and settle the list under his hand. In this case there had been no settlement or certificate under the judge's hand, and therefore this was not an appeal, but in the nature of a review under eection 17 of the Act of 1849. Mr. CAuRNs and Mr. KALSLAKE opposed the motion, and contended that by section 99 of the Winding-up Act, 1848, and the Masters in Chancery Abolition Act, the official managor should have applied by way of summons to the judge in chamnbers for the decision of the chief clerk, and that at any rate he was too late in his present application, which should, if right in point of form, have been made in August last, within 14 days from the. exclusion of Air. Libri by the chief clerk. The VIcE.CHA"cE.oR, after referring to the sections of the Winding-up Act which had been cited, said that means were provided by whichthere might be a definite settling of the st, and this was under the hand of the Master. In matters referred to chambers, where parties requested that the question might be heard before the judge it had been the practice to act upon their wish. As to this present matter he could not say that the present list was before him, settled in a judicial form, and the right course would bh to put the matter in a proper train for inquiry. Until signed it was not finaly settled, nor could he say that there had been any such final settlement in the present instance. Before finally determining the matter he shonld wish to consult the other judges as to the course to he adopted. As to the proper way of transacting winding-up business in chambers, some new legislation might he necessary, as the Winding-up Acts and the Masters in Chancery Abolition Act were not made with reference to each other. No order would he now made upon the motion, which must stand over.
COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH. GUIiAT.T, .TTrT.V 7 S,ED V. MGGINS AND OIRSG. (,NUtang at Nisi Priwu, beforc Lord CPBEhpl. e--d a S&eeialo Tu, ELa mr. U. Hill, Q.C., Mr. M. Smith, Q.O., and Mr. Hindmarsh appeared for the paintiff; and Mr. Enowles, Q.C., Mr. Grove, Q. C., and Mr. Webster for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action, William Seed, was a spindle and fly manufaoturer at Preston, and he sued the defend. ants, Messrs. Higgins and Co., who were engaged in the same business at Manchester, to recover damages for the infringemnentof a patent granted to him Onl the 14th of July, 1846, for "coertain improvements in machinery or apparatus for preparing, slubbiag, and roving cotton and otLer fibrous substances." Among other pleas, the defendants denied the novelty and also the tnfringement of the plaintiff's inven- It appeared that the plaintiffs improvement applied solely to that part of the machinery for roving cotton called the flyer," which was employed in connexion with the spindle for the purpose of winding the sliver, or roving upon the bobbin. It consisted "in the application of the principle of centrifugal force to the flyers employed in the above mentioned machinery, for the purpose of producing the required elasticity or pressure upon the bobbin, by causing the small spur or lever which conducts the sliver of cotton or other fibrous raaterial on to the b.bbin to press or bear against the same simply by the action of such force, instead of being effected by springs or such other mechanical presaure." By the application of his invention the plaintiff stated that the bobbin of rovings would not only be made hard, but equally compressed throuRhout, as the pressure upon the same would he found to decrease slightly as the diameter of the bobbin increased, and thus equalize the formation thereof, instead of having the outer or finished diameter made harder than the interior, which had previously been the case. The plaintiff therefore claimed as his invention " the application of the law or principle of centrifugal force" to flyers used in machinery for roving cotton, &c. ; but, on the 12th of August, 1854, the plaintiff entered a disclaimer, in whichhe disclaimed "all application of the law or principle of centrifugal force" as being part of his invention, or as comprnsed in his claim in his specification, "except only the application of centrifugal force by means of a weight acting upon a presser so as to cause it to press against a bobbin, as described in the said specification.' It appeared from the plaintifPs evidence that previous to his3 invention several Jinds of " flyers" had been in use, bot they wero all liable to objections from which the plaintiff's was free. When tho plaintiff first took out his patent, he believed himself to be the discoverer of the application of the law of " centrifugal force" to a flyer; but he afterwards disclaimed that., except as a pplied by mneans of a weight acting upon a presser, as described in the speoification. 'this disclaimer seemed to be owing to the discovery which he made tbat in the year 1830 a Mr. J. C. Dyer had taken out a patent for the application of that principle to the presser attached to his " flyer." Several witnesses were called, who confinned the statement made by the plaintiff, that no flyer made under Dyers patent had come into use; and that the plaintiffs " flyer" was an immense improveraent upon those previously known, and that they had now come into nearly universal use. The plaintiff had granted several licenses to manufacturers to make his "flyer," and from Inquiries he had made he beheved that zs many as 500,000 were at this time in use The plaintiffs scientifio witnesses were cross-examined to show that Dyer had discovered the application of the lawv of centrifugal force to a presser attached to a flyer, and thatI the action of the plamntiff'a presEer depended on the same prinocple as Dyed 'b,and that the principle of centrifugal force wras applied by him in a, aimil ar mianner. The difference pointed out by the. witnesses was that in Dyer's patent the weight which, by the revolutio - f- he lye onthospidle prduced the c-emtrifugal fore, was attached to the presser at the bottom of the flyer; but i the plaintiffs patent the presser was carried up one leg of the tlyer, andhad the weight attached to it at the top. ihe flyer which the defendants had used was pro. 4nged th tb9 witnesses, and it appeared to have the welght meither at the top, as in the plainti's patent, nor at the bottom, as in Dyer's patent, but A little above the middle. They. therefore, sud it was more like Seed's than Dyer's; but if the weight had been a little lower, it would have been more like Dyer's than Seed's. The plaintiffs witnesses stated that the plaintiff's flyer was superior, because, in the fist place, it caused much less vibration to the machinery; and, secondly, It occupied rauch less room in the frame. At the close of the plaintiff's case, Mr. KNof LEs sabmitted that the plaintiff's specification was bad, because it was shown that the same pinciple was contained in Dyer's specification of 1830, and also in Higgins's specification of 1834 lord CAMPBELL said he should have been of the same opinion but for the plaintiff's disclaimer, in which he claimed the application of centAifugal force to a weight acting upon a presser at the top of the flyer. Mr. Xxowrxs said that the plaintiff, in his specification, claimed the application of the principle of centrifugal force, and he could not-make his specification good by making a fresh claim in tho disclaimer. The learned counsel also contended that if the particular mode only was claimed-viz., with the weight at the top of the flyer-there had been no infringement. Lord CAMPBELL Eaid he would give the learned counsel' leave to move on the first point; but it.was for the jus to say whether there had been any infringiiient. Several witnesses were then called by the defendants to show that flyers had been made with presses under Dyer's patent of 1830, and had been in successful use. Scientific witnesses were also examined to show that there was no substantial difference between the flyer used by the defendants and that described in Dyer's specification, and that it was at all events more like Dyer's than like the plaintiff's. In Dyer's the weight was at the bottom, in the plaintiffs at the top, and in the defendants it was in the middle of the flyer. Mr. Kxowr.x% in summing up the defendants! case to the jury, contended that there was no novelty in the plaintiff's mvention, inasmuch as he had been anticipated by Dyer ; but, if the weight being placed at the top of the flyer was a material part of the plaintiff's invention, it had not been infringed by the defendants, for they had placed their weight in thO middle of the flyer. Mr. HnLL, in his reply, remarked that the defendant Higgins had not ventured to come into the box to say where be had got the idea from which he had made his flyers. The merit of the plaintiff's invention consisted in his carrying the presser up the leg of the flyer to a weight at the top, which had the effect of obviating the vibration and saving space. Lord CASIPBmLL, in summing up the evidence, told the jury that if they were of opinion that a competent workman, by reading Dyer's specification, could construct the plaintiff's flyor, there was no novelty in his (the plaintiff's) nvention, and the defendants would be entitled to a verdict; but if there was a substantial difference between the two the plaintiff would be entibled to the verdict. His Lordship observed that, according to the evidence, the plaintiff's flyer was a very useful invention, and had produced quite a revolution In that department of manufacture; but, still, if it was not new it could not be maintained. The second point for the jury would be whether there had been any infringement, and the jury must say, upon the evidesce, whether or not the flyer made by the defendants was an imitation of the plaintiff's. The jury having retired to consider their verdict, Lord CAMRBELL said he did not wish to try another patent cause at these sittings. Mr KNowLEs observed that there had been an unusual number tried. His LoRDSIIIp added that, when Manchester had its own assizes, he hoped they would try their own patent causes, (Laughter.) On their return into court the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on both issues. His LontDsnar gave the defendants leave to move on the points reserved as to the effect in point of law of the disclaimer. SEED V. THE GENlRAL STEA1 NAVIGATION C03PANY. Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty, QC., appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. Dowdeswell efor th defendants. The plaintiff in this action, John Seed, was a grocer at Keighley, in Yorkshire, and he sued the General Steam. Navigation Comupanyf, as common carriers, to recover the value uf certain goodls which had been lost, as alleged, by the defendants servants. It appeared that certain orders had been delivered to the defendants' carman, named FardelL with instractions to fetch 30 bags of sugar from a wharf in London. The earman sent his man, named Edwards, who brought back only 25 bags, and gave as a reason for sot getting the whole that there was not time, as the warehouse was cIosed at 4 o'clock. In two days after, when the other five bagswere sent for, it wasdiscoveredthatthey had been deliv'ered the daypre. viousto a boy who came for them. The boy hadcome with a light cart havingFardell'snameprinted on it, and whosaidto the warehouseman, " Challis, I've come for those 5 bags of sugar left yesterday." It appeared that when the 25 bags had been fetched away the delivery orders had all beon left at the wharf; and it was contended that the defendants, by their servants, bhd been guilty of negligence in respect to the order for the five bags of sugar, whereby the sugar had been lost. * Mr. KNowLss, for the defendants, submitted that there was no evidenee of negligence, but thier Lordships havinA decided to the contrary, the learned counsel called severa witnesses to show that when a delivery order had been de. livered, and for any reason the goods were not delivered, the usage was for the order to be retained ti1l the party caled again. The delivery foreman of the London Docks stated that when a delivery order was delivered, and nothing was delivered under it, he should retain the order; but on cross. examination he admitted that in such a case if he were requested he would return it. Other witnesses were examined, from whore evidenco it appeared that Edwards, the man who had fetched the 25 bags, was now undergoing penal servltud. fvr cvriime of wirlct ne nad bee. a-lAdr.tad It was admitted that the goods had not been obtained by any one in the defendants' employ, unless it was by Edwards. Mr. BOVInL, in his reply, said he thought there could be no doubt that Edwards had sent the boy to get the goods and he contended that the loss was owing to the negligence of the company's *ervants. Lord C%irrBELL, in summing up the evidence, left two questions to the jury,-first, whether they thought the goods hadbeen obtained by Edwards; and, secondly, whether there had been negligence on the part of the company's ser. vants. The jury found both questions in the affirmative, ord CAMPBELL said that, upon the finding, ho should direct a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff. Verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 171. 14s. 6d. STA PE AIND OTHERS V. THE EASTERN COUNTIVS AILWAY COMPANY. Mr. Collier, Q.C., Mr. Kngdon, and Mr. Matthews ap. peared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr Sharpe for the defendants. The plaintiffs in this action were Messrs. Sharpe, Stewart, and Co., the manufacturers of locomotives, who sued the Eastern Counties Railway Company to recover the sum of 8721. 6s. Ild., being the balance of an account which the plaintiffs claimed to be due to them from the company for locomotives. UIltimately it was agreed that the cause, and all matters in difference between the parties, should be referred. FArT AND OTHERS V. TIIACKER AND OTHERS. Wr. M. Chambers, Q. C., and Mr. J. A. Runssell appeared for the plaintiffi ; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Hannen, for the defendants. The plaintiffs in this action were printers in Newgate. street, and they sued the defendants, fwho were the preprietors of a periodical called the Orland Nlw., to recover danages for removing the printing of the work frcm the plaintiff-s' offieo without giving a reasonable notice. After the examination of the first witness the trial wisa adjourned till to-morrow. SECOND COUlRT. (Siaing at Nisi Prius, at Guildhall, beose Mr. Justice WIGrT},LiN and a Special Jury.) WOODFIE V. SIEMPSON AND OTEBRS. The trial of this cause was resumed this morning. The Lord Chief Justico of the Common Pleas stated that he wished to add to his evidence. He had stated yesterday that if Air. Woodfine had acted according to his advice he would have given 1,0001. It had occurred to him since that this might have created an impression that he had advised him to give that sum. What he meant was, that he felt so strongly that the case was desponding, that if Mr. Woodfine had acted according to the spirit of his advice he would have compromised the matter by giving that sum. No sum was mentioned but 5001., and that sum he had offered, but it was rejected so peremptorily, and the sum named as the minimume on the other side appeared so large, that he thought the case ought to be fought out. Mr. Justice WirH=zAx said he did not know what view the jury tcok of the caso after the evidence of the Chief Justice-whether there was any culpable negligenec; because it was quite clear that, under the circumstanceo, the counsel would not have advised witnesses being called. Sir F. TMESIGER said, of course, if that was now the opi. nir-n of the i'ury- The JisnDE: .t had occurred to him that, after the evidence of the Chief Justice and Mr. Chambers, the jury might have formed an opinion on the matter. A Juror.- It depends entirely whether or not the advce of counsel is to overrido that of the solcitor; in that csse I fancy the trial would be at an end. Sir F. THESIORS said there would bo this consideration, as to whether there was a commurication made to the counsel of the strong determinationxof the client that wit. nesses should be called. The Jury.-We would rather hear the case. Mr. Snijith.-I reside at Hornchurch, and was for many years in the Audit-office. After some discussion it was ruled by the Court that the priop mode of proving what this witnesssaidontheformer tra wis by reading the transcript of the short-hand notes taken on the trial. Mr. Cherer put in a transcnpt of the notes he took of Mr. Smith's evidence on the trial of " Smith v. Woodflne" this day twelve months. The transcrit was read. Smith stated that Woodfine had told him lEae had 6,0001. a-year, and that the brewery was worth 100,00(1., and that he had 19,0001, in the funds, The evidence went on to state the whole matters relative to the former trial. Mr. PRENTICE (who on the former trial was counsel for Woodfine, but was now for the present defendants and against his former client) read the evidence of Mrs. Matthews, the sister of Miss Smith. It had reference to the breach of promise of marriage. The evidence of several of the other witnemses, and many of the old love letters, were read. James Alexander Simpson.-I am one of the defendants. I commenced practice in 1818. The plaintiff called on me on the 6th of May, 1866. le was a stranger tome at the time. I had a partner aamed Cobb, who isdea, The plaintiff brought me an attorney's letter threatening an action against him, He went into a long explanation of the facts, and stated that be bad been most shamefully treated by the Smith family, and this was an attgmpot ho extqrt money, and he would resist it if it cost him 1,000. I was led to believe that M1iss Smith had broken the con. tact, and not he. I had a correspondenoe with the other attorney and communicated it to the plaintiff. I cautioned hun o the consequences, and told him a refusal In plain words was not necessary. Immediately after the writ was issued I requested him to give mno in writing the dates of ll the trasactions. He brought me a writteu statement. I asked him particularly whether anything had been said in reference to settle. ment or means. He said, "No-" he had told Mr. Smith that what he intez,ded to give his daughter he might give to her brother, as he did not want it. Upon that I instructed counsel to prepare the pleadings, which I afterwards explained to him. *I consulted him particularly as to the counsel he would wish engaged, and we determined on the Attorney-General and Mr. Chambers. After notice of tral I wrote to apprize him it had been given. He caled the next day, and I said I would'prepare the brief imre. diately that there might be ample time. I prepaed the brief, endeavouring to embody in it everything he had told me. I sent him a copy of the brief and a draught of a proof for him and his mother on the 14th of June. I wrote also t- although I lad sent him a proof, thero was no proba. aility of any witnesses being examined. The plaintiff called on the 17th with his mother, and brought back the brief, and suggested several alterations and correctious, which were all made.: Mrs. Woodfine wished the evidence to be corrected. She said, "CYoa seem to have let the Smiths off very easily." I said I should be doing injustice to her son if I introduced such a line of defence. The brief was again sent to him corrocted. I was thenunder an impression that he would be examined. I had mistaken the Act of Parliament. Idiscoveredmy error on the 20th of June, and I am under a strong impression that this was communicated to him on the 21st of June. I was afterwards taken ill. On the 27th of June I had a long conversation with Woodfine, and expressed my regret that I had fallen into the error, but I said it would not prejedico him. as in a case of this kind it was an unheard-of thing to caU witnesses, the object being to have the last word. Mr. Roberts took the m ement of the case from that time. I saw WcodfLne ont te Saturday afternoon of the trial, between the two hearings. Mfrs. Woodfine complained that Mrs. Smith had given evidence that was perfectly untrue. I was goingout, Ls I was very ilL I saw the plaintiff again after he trial. He complained of the result, and of the evidence that had been given; that the Attorney-General's speech was an ineffectual one. He muade no complaint of me, or about witnesses being called. He never told me what his prorty was. I always went for a verdict. The day after the tria he went into a statement of his property. I did not hear them say on the Saturday that they could prove he had no mnoney In the funds. Croes-examined.-It is the duty of the attorney to prepare the brief ItAiB his duty to make the proper inquiries. I always felt that if I went into a statement of his property I might induce counsel to think I had not confidence in his statement, which I rea31y had. It is a matter of opinion whethe'r I ought to have madecounsel aware ofeverything. In ordinarycircumstancesitisusualto state theparticularsof th pDroperty, but it mustbeleftto the discretionof.theattorney intended leaving it to coun to ask for any further inf mation they might require. A brief where counsel require further iormation is not defective. It is a matter of opinion. It is the solicitor's duty to instruct counsel fuly according to his disgretion. I did not think it expedient to go into particulars of his property. I believed that he could be a witness. He did nQt ask me whether he could be a witness, as I believe. I don't mean to deny that I might have said that parties might now be witnesses. I did not prepare the bref till after issue delivered. The brief was engrossed, I think, between the 24th and 26th. I have office books. I was under an misapprehension as to the exception in the Act. I think I looked in the Act on the 21st. I subpoenaed Miss Smith under the same impression. I undertook the whole of the business down to the time of the brief being prepared. On the 27th [ told Woodfine I had found I was under a misapprehension as to the Act of Parliament. He did not say he believed the brief to be very meagre, but onthe contrary. Mrs. Woodfine said I had not abused the Smith fanily. After the first day's trial the plaintiff and his mother did not complain of the statements of the witnesses, and that they must be contradicted. She said the stataments were untrue. These particulars will not be found in my daybook. I did not lay imstructions before counsel to advise upon evil dence. I delivered the brief a week before the trial. I never knew an iustanco of witnesses being called for the defendant in such a case. I could not get a consultation with the Attorney-General, though I sent every day, he was so much engsaed. I might have had a conference with Mr. Prentice, but fedid not think it a case that required it. When t discovered the error I altered the brief. The proof of Miss Smith for cross-examination was engrossed. There was a proof for the present plaintiff which is altered to Mr. Smith, embodying the evidenec of Woodfine and Smith. I asked Mr. Woodflne whether I could rely upon Mr. Smith giving fair and impartial evidence, and he said I might. I never had any communication with counseL I was ill. I had stated in the brief that the plaintiff's family would not hesitate as to the means of obtaining their ends, as the whole was a conspiracy. When the plaintiff was going to take away the pae rs I did not say I admitted I had been in error. He aasi "Ur. Roberts bad insulted him by stating that he believed Mr. Smith's statement inpreference to his. I said I was sure he did not intend it. I never said that I admitted I had been in error, and would not make any cbarge; not a word of the sort took place. I know affidavits were prepared. On the 8th of July Mr. and Mrs. Woodfie came to the office and saw Roberts. The names of Collier and Mason were nevermentioned; if they had beenI wouldhave taken care they should have been ira ttendance. I could not have mentioned them to counsel. If my client had insisted upon witnesses being called I should have mentionedit to counsel. Cirumnstances mayalter the course to be adopted. No doubt the amount of property would influencethe jury. rja.ox"mii.a. -Ii. my hi' .f T aaiA fb. plj~ntjfr vMa tbA son of a man of considerable property. In my opinion that was a proper statement to make. I did not consult lr. Prentice, because I thought it%desirable to have a consultation with all three counseL. Mr. Roberts.-I am one of the defendants. The plaintiff first spoke to meon the 21st of June. The plaintiff had the brief three times. He suggested an alteration in the brief. On the 22d or 27d I saw the plaintiff, who asked what I thoughtof his case. I said, " According to your own case eu stand well, but in these cases the juries go with the Hy. e said, "I suppose my oath is as good as hers" 1 said,j"You will neither of you be exarained as wit. nesses" He said, " Oh, I did not know that. Mr. Simpson eeened tobe doubtfal." I saw him on the 27th. I am postive he knew he was not to be a witness. He said, Can I get any other evidence which I may have supplied 1" 1 said,"I don't think you can, because you seemto have been by yourself on every occasion you Eaw the Smiths." I saw him frequently afterwards, just for a moment. I did notattend to the case. We were not able to get a consultation earlier. I sent up our clerk every day to the Attorney-General. The consultation was on the mornIng of the trial; it lasted over half-an-bour. The other counsel were present. Mr. Chambers asked the plaintiff what his income was. The plaintiff said about 2,001. a- year. 3M. Chambers said, "But what did you tell the lady you had I" The plaintiff hesitated and said, "I might have told her 2,0001. or 1,500. a-year;butI amnotsure." TheAttorney-General said," You have been a great fool, Sir ; you will have 2,0001. at the leasttopay."I1 aaked counsel whether there was anything wanted; they sald " No," all of them. I suggested to Mr. Prentice a proposal as to a compromise, as the Attorney-General seemed to have a bad opinion of the case. MIr. Prentice said, " Which had you rather do, give 1,0001. or run the chance of a verdict '" The plaintiff said, ' I would prefer going to trial - if the whole amount is given it will not hurt me." He was in an excited state. Eie was present at the trial, by the side of Mr. Prentice. I heard Mr. Smith examined about the property, which came upon me by surprise, as the piaintiff had given me no information upon the subject. After the first day's trial I said to the Attorney-General, " I can't believe that Smith's statements are true; shall I obtain any evidence of fortune?I" The Attorney-General said, "No ; they are only what Smith said Woodfine stated to him, and you can't contradict them." I ask-ed him again if there was anything else I could do. The Attorney-General said, "Yes ; I want to know what the old lady rays about the interview." I then left the court. The Attorney-General said, "I must place it all upon the father, the hasty issuing of the writ, and the lawyer's letter." I left the court accompanied by the plaintiff and his family. Between GuildhaU and Mfoorgate-street I said to him, "1 These statements of £r. Smith are very awkward; teU me, did you ever: make those statements9," He said, "No; they are all - lies. I said, " What is the value of this brewery 9" He said, " Certainly not more than 50,000!., at the outside." Not a single syllable was said to me about Mason, Collier, or Shaw cn that day. I then went to my office, and met Mr. Simpson going out. The plaintiff did not to him mention the names of Collier, Mason, or Shaw. Mrs. Woodfine's carriage was waiting. I told her what the AttorneyGeneral had said about the interview with Mis Smith, and requested her to bring me an account of it. On Monday morning Mr. rand Mrs. Woodfin came to my office. Iwent through a written statement which she brought with her, and her statement did not appear tome to be collected and clear. On that morning, either before, at, or after consul. tation, not a word was said about Collier, Mason, or Shaw. I said to Mrs. Woodfie, "At aLl events, you can swear toat your son has no money in the fundss" She said 8he could state it. I then had a consultation with the AttorneyGeneral, and I communicated to him whatever Mras. Wood. fine lad told me. The Attorney-General questioned Mr. Woodfine, and there was a discussion as to cealling witnesses. The Attorney-General said, " I do not like to give themthelastvword. IwillnotcallMs. Woodfine."Inmy judgment I did not think it desirable to call any witnesses. I remember an application to stay the execution. The plaintiff said be was afraid he could not in his affidavit deny that he had told Smith the brewery was worth 100,0001. The statement as to the plaintiff's Income was originally left blank In the affidavit, but was filled up by his dictation as 7501. I think on the 9th of July he complained of noglgence. He said that the Attorney-General haA manaed bis case very badly; that he had not read a letter of r. Simpson to Clayton and Co., and he was sure we had not gven him a suflicient fee. He then complained of me for the first time. He did not on the Saturday after the trial say there was a great deal of difference between 6,0001. and SK; and I did not say it should be set right on the Monday. Cross-examined.-The first business I did in the case was the delivery of the briefs on the Ist of July. I had not doue anything in the cause before, except just look through the briefs. Jdid not first enlighten Mr. Simpson as to his being a witness. I had nover given such a matter a thought. If I hadbeen asked I might have said I would look; but it never occurred to me. I would not have given an anmer without looking. I did not see in the draught brief that Mr. Woodfine was put down as a witneas. When I readthe brief he was notput down as a witness, I:thinkIhoerd that Mliss Smith had been subpoensed. I now do know it. When I heard she had been subpoenaed I did not go and remonstratewith my partner. On the 21stIhad noma-. teril conversation on the subject of the cause. When the. Court rose on the Saturday the plaintiff and his family came to the door of the office. I am incliued to think thp mother ind ster stood by the door. The carriag may bave been Mr. Thompson's. At no time on the Saturday q day w any inaitszi in do df 0oier orMason; za* was anYthing sid about the property having been valued.

They found the greates Woiudue wth Je Attorney-General for not calling Mrs. James HfewletL-I am clerkc to the defendants. I delivesed the briefs in ISmith and Woodfinep on the let of Tuly.

The examination as to the contents of the books was obleced o, ecusethequetin ws watevidence the de. fendants hai ready at the time of the trial. te e t The learned Junex said Le should admit the evidence. It was, however, withdrawn. The following evidence was then produced for the pldn. Mwr. Thompson.-I and my wife walked from the court on the Monday withlloberts. M1 wife found fault with him for do ohn catlled lson an Collier, as he had been told to Cross.examnned.-My wife said " Youtought to have calied Mr. Maon and Mr.Collier,"'and-she was most intemaerate -" you ought to have clled witnesses for the defendant." I heard this most distinctly. I did not make any memo. randum. I don't recollect what she said as we were going to the court that morning. I mentioned this to Mr. Tayloe a few minutes ago. Mrs. Thompson.-After the verdict I walked with my husband and Roberts from the court. I found fault with Roberts, and 'exprassed myself in a manner mny husband did not think lylike. Cross-examined.-I asked him why ho had not called Mr. Collier, Mason, and Shaw, as my mother and brother bad requested on the Saturday. I said they ought to have been called, and asked Low the jury could understand the case without their beln3 called I first meiltioned it this miorning. Mdr. Serjeant Bmrys then proceded to suim up the case. Mr. Thompson and bis wife differed as to the words used, and the important words were, " as you were desired to do en the Saturday," and MIrs. Thompson varied her statement. If his client were not an attorney there would not be the slightest 'doubt as to the verdict, but he h-new an attorney had harder measure dealt out to hima than others, and a learned judge had said he expected tosee the daywhen aralo should be moved for calling onanattorney to show cause why he should not be executed. An attorney was justified an following the course pointed out by his counsel, and if he did not follow thatadvice he was not justfied. If a client was absenton a trialn attorney was liable to an action if he did not follow the advice of counseL It was the bounden duty of an at. torney toobey and act under the advice of counsel. Mr. Woodlne had his own counsel, and well had he chosen, for lie was sur his friend would re-echo his observations that that learned juEdgehadhby his hh talent and exertions well merited the high position in which he was placed and no man was more properly?placed. His friend Mr. Chambers was well known in thin ball, and Mr. Prentice was a most eminent lawyer; and both mighgt wellasprU e to s * the place, or near the place, of the Lord ChefJustice, and all those three learned persons had stated what had taken place at the consultations.

John Lyall, John Rennie, and Robert LTall, also merchants there ; and the defendants are essisr. Wf 'iam and Williamii Andrved Lyall, of London merchants and tommission agents. The plaintiffs, be'hu jointly coneened in a purchase of goats bins, consigrac them for Wse to the defeandats, who, after keeping them on hand for upwards ofa&year, sold them in March, 1855, to MIr. Calverwell, at 4s. per dozen. In May they were resold by or. Culverwell at 5s. 9d., and shortly afterwards they were again rsold ata smnall futther advanre. Mr.Black. conceivin)g that the defendants had not used due diligence, brought this action against them for negligently sellig at a less price than might have been obtaied, and obliged the other laint to join in the actionw on indemnifying them agains costs. the defendants by their pleas denied the negligence imputed to them, andl alleged the leave and license of the plaintim for selling at the ptce obtained. For the intiffs it was contended that the sale should have been y public auction, and not by private contract. Several witnesses baving been called, and along correspondence put in, Mr. berjeant SExn addressed the jury for the defence. Both defendants, aud onf the brokers through whom the lu was effected, were ced, and dtePlCd to thu badnes of the market at the period of the sAle, and fo somea time o. Tiously. They aleo stated that the skins were several times put up to auction without beitg able to sell them that they were detaeriorating by keepg, and that the highest offer next to the price obtainecl was only 3s. 9d. It was also shown that two of the plaintiffs had been in England while the goods were lying for sale, and were aware of some of the lower t rices offered, and that they desred the defendants to do the bet they could. WilliamEcroyd, a tanner,fromBermondsey (who declinied to give his evidence until Is. Cd., the balance of his expenses, were paid him, which was accordingly done) stated that he purchased some of the skins, and that a large portion of them were so damaged as not to be worth tanning. Those which were not tannedl were made into glue. He lost money by the transation. M1r. Raines, manager of M1r. Rowe, a skin broker, valued the skins at 2s 6d. a dozen in June, 185L. M1r. Robert Lyall, one of the plaintiffs, stated that he was not dissatisfied with the conduct of the defendants, nor were the other partners in his firm at Calcutta. In answer to a question fromn the learnedl JUDGx, the witness stated that, although related to the defendants~, he had no peulrinterest in theirbuemness. Mr. ISerJe-a-ntHEr, was proceeding to reply, when The learned JUDGE initerposed, and, appealing to Mr. Wilde, askedl if he thought At was any use to let the trial go further, after it thus appeareaI that all the plaintiffs except one imputed no blameo to the defendants. The jury intimated that they were all of opinion that the defendants had not been guilty of negligence. His LoRDsEaP said that was quite his opinion. Verdict for the defendants.

Mouh The parcel was dl carried to rlymouth, and was dulytndrdtth consignee, who, however, refusqed to pay more ta s d for the carriage, the defendauts demanding . 3d., which charge they were entitled to make. The clerkc who presented the parcel told Reynolds that unless he paid the proper charge they would eend it back to London ; and, upon Reyniolds absolutely refusing to pay the same, the parcel was on the following day sent back to London, and was eventually lost. The jury found that the defendants oughit to 'heve kept the parcel at Plymouth for a reasonable time, and that a reasonable time had not elapsed. Under the direction of the learned judlge, the verdict was entered for the plaintiff, with damages equivalent to the value of the goods subject to leave to move to enter the verdict for the defen dants, or for a new trial. The maj6rity of the Court were of opinion that the verdict ought not to be disturbedl. They weeof opinion that the duty of the defendants as carriers did mot terminate upon the refusal of the consignee to pay the charge for carrage, and tha, assuming it did, the defendants were bound to exercise care in providing for the safety of the goods; and that the car whichi they were bounid to exercise sprang out of their original employment a carrers, and that it was their duty to xeep the goods at Plymouth at least for a reasonabole time. They were of opinion that the sending of the goods back to London, as they did, afforded sufficient evidence of negligence. Another question was also raised. The defendants' line of railway terminates at Bristol, andl the parcel was carried thenee to Plymouth by the South Devon Raiway The Court were unanimously of oplnion that the South Devon Company were the agnts of the defendants In dealing with the parcel ; and that the defendants were as much. bouncd by the acts of the clerk of that company as if heo had been in their own uimnediato employment.

Sewell, minendrapes ; and Mr. G. Lewis, of the firm of lewis and Lewis, appeared for a creditor named Watson; Mr. Sargood supported the application. ft appeared that the insolvent, who was suffering from illness, was in custodv of the sheriffat his own residence, in Camibridge.terrace, Hyde Park; and it was alleged that the constant presence of the sheriff's offcers in his apartment had an irritating effect, which tended to prevent his recovery. Mr. Lxw3s objected that the present application Was really to reheve the sheriff from responsibility. The insol. vent ought to be present, in order to be examined upon questions of property andjrisdiction. The learned COesSioNxn thought this was not the time to discuss questions of property, which would cone forward more properly at the hearing. Mr. Lxwrs then objected that the insolvent haa not resided within the jurisdiction of the Court for eix months immediately preceding his petition Mfrs. Biggs, lady'sumaid to M1rs. Dimsdale and a creditor in the schsedule, was called to prove that the ineolvent had left England for Antwverp in October, and did not return to this country until tho 12th of February last. Upon the occPaion of his leaving England he told the witness that he did soin order to come to some arrangement with his creditors. The learnedCoamrrssosxs, after consultingwith the Chief Commissioner and referring to Mfacrae' Insolvency Pradice, was of opinion that, although a temporazy absence from England during the six months prior to the petition would not destroy the jurisdiction, yet that, where a man had gone abroad in order to avoid his creditors, he must be held to have forfeited for the tine his residence in this country. Ih this case, therefore, tho six months' residence wthin the jurisdiction of the Court was not complete, and the petition must be dismissed.
CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Jldy 7. OLD COURlT. (Before thc RECORDIR.) Robert DaWBon, 20, described as a tailor, and Alfred Gardner, 21, labourer, were charged with feloniously setting fire to a stack of pulse, with intent to injure Henry Budd. The prosecutor, it appeared, was a farmer at Little Stanmore, and on the morning of the 18th of June, about 2 o'clock, he was going in the direction of his rickyard, wvhen he met the prisoners coming away from it, and almost imaediately afterwards the stack was discorered to be on fire. The prisoners were pursued and taken into custody, and upon Dawson being charged with causing the fire he said that he had been to the relieving officer, who would not give him any relief, and he thought ke m.igt as well fire a rick as starve. The other prisoner said that ho was merely accidentally in company with Dawson when the offence was committed, and he told him that the fLre was accidental, and he was a considerable distance from him at the time. The jury Acquitted Gardner, and Dawson, who had pleaded guilty, was sentenoed to four years' penal servitude. E1len Charler, 19, was Indicted for stealing two biMls of exchango of the value, respectively, of 1O8& and: , and twelve shillings in money, the property of James Hendry. * Mr. Cooper conducted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Platt. The prosecutor is a merchant caring on bunness in Harp-lane, Tower-street, and it appeared that about n o'clock at night on the 19th of June he was on his return home from a paty, when he was accosted by the prisoner near the Post-office, in St. M,artin's-le-Grand, and' she fol. lowed him as far as Wood-street, where, it a p-ired, she placed herself infrout of him, and immediateiyaRterwardsran. away.

SECOND EDITION. 1 TTh-R TIMX&ESOFFICR, wnediwdcy foj ifng. EXPRESS FROM PARIS.i Tihe following is the letter of our Pa-ls correrpondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m.:- The Minister of the Isterior is said. to be preparIng for the Emperor a detailed report of the electoral movement which has just ended in the election oE three democratic candidstes in Paris. The report will describe the proceedings in every arrondissement, and vven in oVecy canton. 1 presume it wiiU be published, and thahthe press will be allowed fall libery for comment or'correction, if an official dooument on such a aubject be really susceptible of 'correction. The result of the last elections you have before thig , whatever difference may be found in the numbers already given and those published in to-day's M%onbieur, the Opposition candidates still have the majerity over their opponents. In the first elections (the 21st and 22d Juno) GeneralCavaignac tad 10,SM -votes; in the second, 10,059; while the (?overnment candidate, M. Thibaut, had in the first 10,108, and in the second 9,952. In the first, M. Ollivier, the Democratic candidatc, obtained 6,741, in the fsecond 11,O5-an increase of over4,000; while his opponent, Al. Varin, had in the first 9,633, in 'the second 10,006. In the first election lI. Darinon obtained 6,826 suffrages, which in the second have swelled to 12,0eS; while the Govern-ment candidate, M. Lanqutetin, had in the first 10,609, and in the second 11,03S. The increase in favour of the Democratic candidates, M HT. Darizmon and Ollivier, is owing to the transfer of votes to those which had in the first ballot been given to MM1. Garnier-Pag,s, Bastide, and others, who have not come forward on the second trial ; and the fdlling off in iL. Thibaut's suflrages is attributed to the pressure exercised by the authorities. It is certain that the result has occasioned much surprise and regret to the Government, who up to the 1 tst moment made sure of success-at all events, in two out of three districts. The Minister of the Interior is said to have informed the Emperor that he wo ild answver for the triumph of the officia nomin3es. The electors have responded to that assurance, if it really was given, in a manner he did not expzc'. The return of General Cavaignac is the most painful of aU. The other doses would be taken wit', comparatively slight dissatisfaction, but General Cavaignac is a pill which is swallowed with the greatest repugnance. We also learn that in th.e second election in the town of Angers, the Democratic candidate, formerly a Commissioner under the Republic, has obtained 4,422 votes to 1,700 given to the Government candidate. The question now remains as to whether the five Democratic Deputies for Paris-namely, Carnot, Cavaignac, Darimon, Goudehaux, and Ollivier-_rill take the oath to the Constitution and the Emperor, -an indispensable preliminary to their sitting in the Legislative Corps. Of two-namely, Darimon and Ollivier-no doubt is entertained of their doing so; of Goudehaux and Carnot following their example there is great probability; of General Cavaignac-the most important of all-there is still some, but I find not much, doubt. The electors who voted for them are certainly desirous they should take the oatb, and even the ragnoen, who form the bulk of M. Darimon's constituents, would not have come to the ballot except on that understanding. The taking the oath to a Oo c ernment which is as opposed to the principles of all is a matter for their own conscience, but the taking it with, as is stated by their friends, the mental reservation of keeping it as the Presideat of the Republic kept hiz to the Constitution of 18S, would be an act of very questionable morality. bWhatever may be iPs character or its value, the Imperial Government is decidedly the issue of universal suffrage, and they who have always appealed to it caunot now complain because it has not given them a siigime to their own taste. It is said in oflicial quarters that at a late meeting of some of the exiled chiefs of parties, among whom were several Orleanists, the question was fully dis culssed, ard the decision was in favour of General Cavaignac's submitting to that test ; and by some of his warmestj partisans it is said that if he refuse it he is lost as a public man. Between this and the meeting of the Chambers there is ample time for re flection. Of the ten electoral districts of Paris, five of them have returned Democratic ¢andidates, and it will take the inmense majority the Governmnat have obtained in the departments to console them for this untoward event. D Despatches have been received from Jassy, announcing that Prince Vogorides has, notwithstaading the protests tendered against the electoral list, as they stand, determined to take no notice of them, but to proceed with the elections. Despatches have been received to-day from the French Mfinister at Turin. They announce that the arrests continued at Genoa, and that tIazzlni had left Leghorn on the 2d in a ship carrying the Portuguese Rag. A letter from Leghorn, of the 4th inst., says that the Government accounts admnit 15 soldiers killed and 20 insurgents shot who were captured with arms in their hands. Private accounts estinate the soldiers killed at 26, and the insurgents at 60. The bands who attacked the guard-houses were com posed of 170 armed men. The soldiers, although surprised, ran to their arms, and maintained their position. The insurgents then dispersed through the town and murdered every isolated soldier or genllarme they met. Travellers who arrived at Leghorn by the steamer Sorrento from Naples, -which thoy quitted on the 30th June, state that a certain agitation reigned there, in consequence of a report that the Calabriaus were in full revolt. The steam-boat Cagliari was at Gaeta. The insurgents who landed frorn hor wero said to be in the neighbourhood of Avellino. It was positively asserted at Naples that Antonio Veneziano, of Messina, a sergeant in a hussar regiment, had attempted to assassinate the King at Grteta, on the 11th of June. The police as stoutly deny that any such occurrence ever took place. A private letter from Genoa, of the 4th, states that several armed men had been discovered in a coach-house, where they had remained concealed since the insurrection. MIiss White, who, aceouding to the -1r7notia, had received orders to quit the country, was still at Genoa. The Grand Duke of Tuscany has published the following proclamation, dated the 2d inst.

In cases in which persons remaining in foreign countries find it necessary to prolong their stay beyond the term indicated on their passport, it will be necessary for them to address their request for an extension of the term to the Governaiental authorities who granted the passport, adding to the request a sum equivalent to the amount of the duties for the whole term during which they desire to be authorized to remain still longer out of Russia. It wi depend upon the Governmental authorities to accord the demands for prolongation which muay be addressed to them." SPAIN. (rito:n oUt o05W COStrESPONDENT.) MADRIlD, JULY 3. To-day's (aette contains Royal decrees accepting the resignation of Marshal Serrano as Ambassador at Paris, and appointing in his %tead Don Angel di Saavedra, Duke of Rivas. Another decree removes from his post the Governor of the Province of Jaen, doubtless on account of the recent disturbances there. By another the Court is ordered to go into mourning for 10 days for the Duchess of Glocester. The Mdirs loan passed the Congress yesterday by 181 votes against 6. To-day the authorization of the law of the press comes under discussion. It nppears that Messrs. Narvaez and &ocedal, finding that to publish it by decree would probably lead to a break-up of the Cabinet, two of whose members are opposed to such a step, have made great efforts to keep a sufficient Chamber, have telegraphed for some absent Deputies, and have entreated others, who were about to depart, to remain until that most important law was voted. It is understood that Messrs. Pidal and Seijas Lozano announcel their resignation as positive, if the law were decreed,but afterwards consented to remain if it were voted by the Chamber, even though not sufficient members were present for the vote of the majority legaUy to give it force. There are-very nice shades of distinction in some men's consciences. Intelligence has come, although not of an official nature, to the effect that a body of the Civil Guard met with the insurgents of La Carolina, aud made 21 prisoners. On the other hband, it is stated that bodies of armed horsemen have appeared in the Serrania de Ronda, and iu the mountains of Toledo. The battalion of infantry that showed symsptoms of disaffection at Vitoria has been sent to St. SebastIaD. There is nothing new in the Mfexican affair, which remains exactly as it was; the disputants apparently contenting themselves with looking at each other, and maldng no way. ITALY. The Piedtnwntese (Gaette of the 4th states that the number of persons arrested at Genoa is 52, including 32 Piedmontese subjects, viz. :-23 Genoese, sLx natives of La, Spezia, one of Chiavari, one of Adessandria, and one of Mortara. The remaining 20 eomprise one Frenchman, five Parmese, seven Lombards, six from Romagna, and one from MIodena. 42 belong to various trades, two are servants, and there are, besides, two landowners, a journalist, a secretary, a clerk, and two students. The same journal adds that two large parcels of gunpowder for mining were discovered at Genoa on the 4th in the neighbourhood of the DucalPalace andthe adjoining barracks, and that two large chests full of muskets and other weapons were seized in the same locality. The Cactolico of Genoa states that several arrests have been made among the Piedmontere navy; that the surgeon of the Regiment of Savoy stationed at Genoa has committed suicide by taking poison; and that there has been ant attempt at disturbance atLa Spezia. A supplement of the Italia e 1Ppolo, the Mazzinian journal published at Genoa, and whose chief editor has been arrested, was siezed on the 3d. On the subject of lazzini, the Gazetta del Pdpolo of Turin says- " It is stated that Mazini was concealed at Genoa, aud that he was to appear at the head of a Proetorian guard as soon as the attempt had succeeded; he was then to have established a Provisional Government in the Ducal Padace. Ho i Y said, however, to have been much astonished on being informed of the small number of persons prepared for the movement, while he had been told that several thousauds vwere ready. One of his friendg advised him to play out the game, in hopes that the populace might join htim, btt Mazzini refused, countermanded the movement, and hastily left Geooa, in order not to be taken." A letter from Rome, in the Co?& il4sonlsel, says "The Pope vill remain three daly at Modena, On his return to Bologca he will again take up his residence at San Slichele, in Bosco, aLd leave between .he l2th and the loth, to continue his journey by Ravenna.

SQ runs the grandiloquent advertisement which IO2nouncts that one of tho noblest fatuilies in the Euglish peerage is extinct, Its effects for sale, and the manor over which the premier earls of England have heldrightand jurisfIction since the days of Henry 1I. is about to pass irto the keeping of strangors' hands. Rusties holyday-seekers from the manutfacturing districts, country gentlemen, and agents from London jostle and crowd about the grard saloons and galleries. Some examine the various lots, note their numbers, and specalate upon their prices; others wonder in dumb admiration at the splendoar round, or regale fard tively upon the contents of heavy baEkets which they lug about the palace, while RButh and Giles, who till then never sat on anything softer than a dairr stool or five-barred gate, reoline with easy luxury upon the embroidered couches in the Music-room, No place is shut against the curious or closed to the depreciating eyes of would-be purchasers. The late Earrs bedroom, plain, qniet, and unostenta;ieous amid the generil magnificenoe, is stil crowded as forming an important portion of the show. Even the noble chapel, with its high vaulted roof and tatined glass windows, which seem to haEh the very daylight into a mournful silence, resounds with loud talking and the tread of feet as visitors pour inand out each hour. Hightowersand chambers, the D3ria apartments and suite of Arragon saloons, conservatories, galleries, and corridors, all, from roof to basement, are thrown open to the public and become as thoroughfares, for the "m magnificent contents of Alton Towers are on view.." The history of Alton Torers, which in a few weeks will be closed, may be soon told. Forty years ago the site was one of the v'ldest and most desolate of moorland hills in North Staffordslire. The approaches to it were bad anddifficult in summer, andin 'v'inter there was no approaching it at all. The land 'was poor, almost destitute of wood and water, and alarge farmhouse, called Alton-lodge, in the centre of an extensive rabbit warren, occupied the spot in which the far-famed seat now rears its lofty towers. The country mansion of the Earls of Shrewsbury was at that time Heythrop Castle, in Oxfordshire, a grand old feudal residence, which with the whole of its contents was unfortunately a few years back destroyed by fire. Their estates in Staffordshire were Eeldom visited by the successive Earls, who on the rare occasions when they did inspect them limited their sojourn to a few days only, and hastened back to forget the discomforts of the visit in the luxury of Heythrep or Grafton-haLL In truth, they had some reason to avoid the place, for beyond the lonely farmhouse we have mentioned and Alton Castle-a mutilated stone remnant of the feudal times, whichhad been finallybattereddown and blown upby Cromwell-no decent homse was within miles of the neighb?,urhood. It was not till 1812 that Charles, the 15th Earl, 'whokeenly appreciated thebeautiesof nature, visitedAltonlodge, and, struck with the rough grandeur of the scenery around, and the unrivalled facilities it would offer to a man of taste, determined to erect a viLa there. When he commenced his design, in 1814, his plan was only to improve and beautify the farmhouse then existing, but the natural capabilities of the place gradnally led to an extension of his views, and after going to some expense he at length decided to rear an edifice worthy of his rank and great po6sessions. To this object he devoted himself exclusively, and, as a Roman Catholic could not then take part in the political movements of the day, he was enabled to pursue his darling object undisturbed by the demands of party warfare. He obtained an enclosure act, and planted and enclosed the hills and commons round the edifice; formed a deer park, and planned the gardens, which for rich and pictturesque beauty leave CObatsworth or Trentham far behind. He was still labouring at the works at the time of his death in 1827, when he left the care of perfectiog and cotapleting his great plan to John, the 16th Earl. He fol. lowed in the footsteps of his predecessor, and even added to and improved on his designs. Tinder his care Altoa T-s mmwas finislbed almost as it stuads at present-o=3 of the most picturesque mansions in Englaud. i Alton Towers is situated on a lofty eminence inthe valley of the Churoet, one of the steep commanding hills which form the base of Derbyshire Peak. The houso overlooks a narrow and very steep ravine, which stretches southward for about a mile aud a-half, terminating in a wild, dark-look. ing gorge, like one of the mountain outlets in South Wales. Tkhe approach to the Towers winds from the railway station at Alton up the steep ascent, which is so thicldy wooded as almost to exclude the light and give a sombre, melaccholy aspect to the scene. The house stands on the very edge of the ravine, down either side of which are the terraced gardens, tier below tier, till the bottomraost parterres are almost undistinguishable save for their brilliant colours. The Towers themselves forma a noble Gothic pila, vast as a little town, 'with a whole crowd of turrets and pin nacles stretching high into the air, and visible for miles around. There is a wild and picuresque irregularity about the structure 'whichgives it anappearanceofantiquityfAr beyond its real age. The principal entrance isunder a massive caqu,re tower of the Gothic type, the broad steps up which are flanked with the armorial hearings of the famiy, the tyke or talbot rampant. Over the high Norm%n doorway the emblazonments of the still older families fro n 'which the Telbots spring are deeply cut in stone, the shields of the Furnivalls and De Verdons, whoze names are foremost in the Doomsday Bool-, with the martlet of the great house of Neville, whose last heir, War'wik the King-maker, fell at the field of Barnet. The entrance-hall is an apartment as large as a modern mansion, and nearly 60 feet in height. Hung round witb weapons, stags' heads, and hunting trophies, it gives the visitor a good idea of the noble suite of apartments which are to follow, and can be seen from the door, for communicating -with the hall is the armoury, and joined to that E gain is the picture gallery, forming one magnificent vista nearly 500 feet in length, and lofty in proportion. The armoury is a splendid chamber, vith a vaulted roof of carved and polished oak, and with every minor fitting, even to the doors and door locks, in keeping with its severe and mAssive style of decoration. I is adorned with a collection of antique 'weapons and armour, second In extent, rarity, and value only to those of Meyrick and the Tower of London. Twenty-four fgures, sheathed from head to foot in complete mail, stand in niches on each side of the haill, and look so formidably grim and silent, that one can fancy vengeful eyes are watching from behind the bsrred vizors, aud though of course not frightened, would prefer not being lefb alone -with them. Some of these suits are most antique and valaable, complete in all the technicalities of pouldrons, grusI ets, lobster topets, ccisses, iambs, and sollarets. The rest of the hall is filled with dismembered portions of cap-4-pie suTts, rich to look at andr uncomfortable to 'wear, 'With halberds, maces, half-pikes, bills, wheel-guns, and double axes, all presenting the came general bloodthirsty features, and expresely constructed to gash and maim on the smallest provocation. A fine old screen of pikes and partisans divides the armoury from the picture gallery, a spacious building 12.3 feet long and 30 feet high. It is lit from the roof, and all its decorations are rich and beautiful, harmonizing well with the fine paintings, mosaics, and sculpture which adorn its entire length. Here are examples from the Roman, Tuscan, Venetian, Florentine, and Dutch schools of art; pictures by E3ffaelle, Domenichino, Titian, Raffaellino, and Veronese; designs by Michaed Angelo, and statues by Canova; in all 700 paintings hang in the galerxies of Alton Towers. Of this large number the fame and history o' about 60 are chronicled in every work on art; the other4 are mixed works, such as one expects to meet in so large and well-known a gallery. There are some remarkably fine 6pecimens by uhbeSe', Wouvermans, and Onyp among them. The greater part of these paintings were purchased by the Shrewsbury family in one lot, from the collection of Madame la hMBre, Bonaparte's mother. Here also is the most celebrated Roman Mosaic table in the kingdom, on 'which the exotic birds and plants seem like pencilled drawings. At the end of the gallery isa magnificent statue of Raffaelle by Ceccarini, a crowd of busts by Canova, a superb candelabrum of variegated marble nino feet high, and a copy of the great Warwick vase in statuary marble, of the same size as the renowned original. The picture gallery opens into the octagon chamber, a copy of the Chapter-houEe at Salisbury. One noble *column supports the groined roof, over which its enriched capitals radiate in all directions. By the side of the column is a representation of the tomb of the irst earl-old John Talbot-Shakspeare's favourite hero, 'with his mailed feet resting on a couchant hound, mud his stony gaze fixed hard And stern upon the intrusive crowd assembled to haggle over the effects of his last descendant. From this the visitor turns into the tribune of the Talbot galery, then to the Talbot gallery itself, then to the Talbot corridor, which leads to the State bed and dressing rooms, the library (two spacious chambers), the ante-library, tho pot's bay, small dining-room, drawing-room, music-room, and sO on from room to room till the visitor is bevildered amid countless chambers, all of which are furnlshd in a style to extort both admiration and wonder. It is useless to attempt describing how the rooms are situated, or even all the rooms in the place. We havo the su£to of Doria rooms, the Arragon rooms, the chintz rooms, the red bedrooms, the yellow bedrooms, the plate-glass roorms, the south rooms, the fleur de li3 rooms east and west, the Susse= and billiard rooms, the upper red bedzooms; and so on till you wondqz what on erth they j were all built f &a mder wh%t pos.Able eombinatioy of CrCUinauu8te4 (nler the Whole County wer entertainel) t'heY 06uJd al1'be used I Yhe Stato bedrooms deserve especial notioe; their fttinig arT Uo gorgeous and magnifioent as literally almost toda&se the eYes. The greatest effort are, of courso, coneentrate I upon the bedeev And appendage&. The formzer i a verY thmple of Morpher; and we should almost fear to say th i exact amount of sleeping sarfa it contains, thought It would certainly oommodate a whole Royal family ith ease. Like Thackeray's bedof the Marquis of CarrA'obs, a murder might be done at one end, and those sleeping at the other know nothing about it. The bedstead I adorned with towers and battlements, spire, domes, and turrets, all carved in oak anc rlohly gilt, so as to make the whole affair, in fact resemblo a sleeping Alton Towers, but in wnhich on could zotsleep,and would tot liko to try for i 1 the wrorldL The hng ngri and, coverlid ot the bed are I ilk damask elaborately embroidered with flowers sad gold tracery. The library and ante-libray re fitted up with massive and zather sombre decorations in black oak, with ehort moral sentences in ill-nnated letters over each book. case. The music and drawing rooms arc decorated with rare magnifiocence. Mirros, mosai otablets, bvhl cabinets, S6vres vaae, old Dreiden chandeliers, and massive candelabra, with gilt couches and chairs covered with embroldered Utrecht velvet, make these saoons the very types of profuse luxury. These ceUings are carved oak with ornaments in blue and gold, and the arms and cypher oE the family upon the panels. The suites of A=gon and Doria rooms are, however, the muost tasteful in ornament, and command the most picturesque views of any in the building. From the drawing-room of the latter suite an almost unequaled prospect is gained over the series -of terraced gardens, fountains, roseries, alcoves, and temples which lie beneath in shady nooks and corners of the deep ravines around the masion. From the vicinity of the music-room a grand conservatory, every groined sach int the roof of which is draped with flowering creepers and rich exotics, leads out into the private gardens, filling the large square space enclosed by the buildings. These are beautifully laid out in the Italian style, and so as to bring the partres up tothe windows of a)l the chief groundfloor apartments. The family cypher is executed here on a large ¢cale in shrubs and flowering plants. Attached to this are the roseries, a series of paths walled and closed in above vdth a trellis-work, andover which are trainedevery known variety of the rose tree. The perfume which they shed through theso secluded waLks is almost overpowering. A private terrace leads from these gardens to a battlemented walk On the snnmnit of the high wa, which flanksone side of the mansion. The view from this over theextenaiverange of grounds and gardens beneath Is one of the most beautiful and picturesque that can possibly be conceived, At the doors of the turrets along the walk, in questionable taste, lay figures in complete armour seenm to keep watch and ward, so that but for the peacefulness of the sene the visitor might well imagine the first grim iron age of violence and rapine had returned again. No merely verbal descriptionwilw convey an adequateides of the rare beauty of the pleasure grounds. Though the ground they cover islittle more than 50 acres in extent, yet the paths through them are so winding and so diversified as to appear almost endless. Both sides of the steep ravine down which they extend are divided into a series of terraces, each of which is named anad distinguiahed for some surpassing natural or architectural beauty. Grottoes, fountains, temples, rookeries, statues, refuges, conservatories, and pagodas are disclosed by every winding path or sand out boldly on little eminences overlooking the deep ravine. The conservatories are a noble range of buildings ornamented in front with massive columns, and surmounted by seven large gilded domes, which seem from the opposite side of the ravine to impart to the whole structure the appearance of an Enstern mosque or palace. Above the terrace on which this stands Is another row of conservatories, almost of the same size, with a portico in the centre and two large gilded domes at either end. Amid the parterres in front of the great conservatory is erected a fac simie copy, in marble, of the Choragic monument of Lysierates at Athens, containing abust of Earl Charles, with the appropriate motto, " He made the desert smile." Above the upper conservatory is a terrace decorated with double rows of marble statues and vases, and above this again is a terrace for the reservoirs filled with aquatio plants, and on the uppermo3t plateau of all a lage imitation of Stonehenge has been erected. Lower down the ravine is the great . crew fountain, the path from which leads up to the Gothic temple-a handsome solid structure, from the summit of which is the finest view over the grounds and towers beyond. Golden gates lead from the gardens into the rock walk, Which, winding for more than a mile, termi. nates at a rouigh mass of stone called Ina's rock, in memory of the great battle fought on the spot between the Kings of Mlercia and Wessex, Coeircd and Tma. In the gorge of the ravine is a tall Chinese pagoda, which has been converted into a fountain, and pours into the als al day a lofty spire of water. Such is a cursory mention of the principal obiects in the gardens, which have been described by London "as the finest combination of Rarden building with garden scenery anywhere existing in Europe:' lFor some years past they hsve been considered as public grounds to al the surrounding neighbourhood, and thousands of visitors from tbe manufacturing districts daily availed themselves of the privilege during the summer. No tickets were required, and every one went in or out as be liked. With a most unusual amount of consideration for the visitors, the predecessor of the late Earl allowed a house for the sale of refreshments to be built in a secluded part ofthe grounds, wherorefreshments of all kinds are sold at a moderate fixed rate. Gradually tbo mansion itself was thrown open-at first on tickets, and then freely to all who came,and though hundreds daily wandered through its beautiful saloons, a shilling's worth of loss or damage was never sus. tained. The Duke of Norfolk, vwho at present holds the property in trust for his second son, has with mach kindness deter. mined to keep up the gardens (though At a cost of 2,000t a- year) for the benefit of the public in the neighbourhood, who from long right of use consider them almost as thei own. Tho sale commenced on Monday, and will continue for the next five weeks, when Alton Towers will be stripped and desolate and closed for many years to come. Yesterday a portrait of Philip IV. by Valasquez was sold for 123 guineas, and a cattle piece by Cnyp for 565 guineas. When the litigation which is about to ensue respecting the real ownership of the estates will terminate is not, how- ever, quite so certain. The lawyers, we imaeine, will prove the real heirs to the property, and probably, after it has keen involved for years in the meshes of Chancery, and exhausted by the constant drain of retainers, refreshers, and reminders, and all the lucrative devices employed to keep counsel constant, the despairing litiagants may compromise, and sell the encumbered property to the sons of some ladwho is now sweeping out his master's warehouse in Cheapside, or arranging spools in a cotton nill at Manchoster. T s then, may the hospitalities of Alton be revived hereafter under the auspicies of a Viscoun' Cripplegate or a Baron Stockport. But Alton Towers just now is no plao i' which to indulge in such reflections. The visitor must rouse, and make way for the bustling emsploy6s of Messrs Christie and Manson. Lot them arrange the couches on which Royalty has reclined in a manner likely to attract the biddems, and ticket the banners which havebeen borne by the Earls of Shrewsbury in the heat of battle, or waved at the coronation of our kings. Let them place in the best light the massive armour of the renowned John Talbot, tho suit in which he fought his way through France by the side of stout John Folstoffe, in which he encountered Joan of Aro, anddiedfullknightly underthe walls ofPoictiers. Itis amere suit of armour now, and the poetical associations of an e. tinot line go for nought, for the last heir male of the Shrewsburies has been laid at rest forever, andathe "msg. nificent effects' of Alton Towers ae for sale,
RVSSTANS ON THE CoAsT Or C=oAsSrA.-Letters from Constantinople of the 24th of June make mention of an official report by Reis Osman, the master of an Ottoman coasting eraft, to the authorities At Trebisonde on the 16th of that month of this Tessel's kaving, while hauled up on the beach at Ghelenjik, been fired into on the 3d by a Russan steamer of war carrying a British w when some seven or eight ott of a score of shots struck her hull, and which same steamer, after firimg some 100 ahots At the bazar, without cauning any damageof importance, weighed anchor, and gave chase to and finally captured another Ottoman coasting craft, zat laden, with a merchant on board belonging to Trebizonde. The steamer afterwards rent on to Sou jak Kaleh, accompanied by three gunboats in tow, where, after bombarding the plaoe, some 80 or 90 armed men landed, ransacked the bazaar of the most valuable goods exposed theren for sale, then set fire to the rest and to all the contiguous houses, capturing two more coasting craft belonging to Trebizonde, laden with butter and grain. Te same Osman Reis, moreover, reports that towards the close of May Scfer Bey and Mehmet Pasha, at the head of 20,000 Circssians and Poles, defeated in the vicinity of Anapa q a Russian force of 15,000, with dreadful sl.aughter, no quarter bein6 shown.
