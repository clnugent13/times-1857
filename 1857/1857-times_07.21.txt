THB MUTIiYY AT DBLHI. The follonwig is the 8ubstance of a native's letter rom all eyewitness of the events at Delhi on the 11th and 12th of May, on the seizure of the city by mutineers of the Native Army, addressed to and communicated by the Vakeel of one of the Rajpootana States:- " For the past two days there has been a commotion In the city, nd events have transpired disastrous to the British rul such as never before ocourred. The city haS been pillagod, and every one is in danger of his life. Thoasands of people with drawn swords are going about the streetL In the general pillage the bankers and other wealthy merchantse houses especially have been entirely ncleed. "Yesterday morning, about 7 o'clock, some regular cavalry arriving from Meerut seized the bridge on the Jumna, killed the tollkeeper, and robbed the till. Leavin a guard at the bridge they proceeded to the Salempore Chowkee, where there was an English gentleman, killed him, and set fire to his house. Then, going under the Delhi King's Palace outsile the city wall, they made proposals to the King. The King told them that that was no placeforthem, but to go into the city. .raving entered the Calcutta gate it was closed. At this time Mr. Simon Fraser, the commnissioner, and the magistrate, were in office. Hearing the tumult they ascended to the top of the river gate of the city, and perceived that troops were coming up along the hMeerut road; mounting a buggy they drove to the city gate, leading to the palace. Finding it closed they dismounted, and getting the wicket of the gate opened to them they proceeded on foot into the citadel. The native governor of the citadel (Killedar) entered after them, and killed them while ascending tho steps of the officers' quarters. (Probably of Captain Douglas, commanding Palace Guards.) Thus much the crowd witnessed. " The mutineers were preceded on their first arrival by 10 or 12 troopers, who, on entering the Rtajghat gate of the city, assured everybody that they had come not to trouble or injure the city people in any way, but only to kiU the European gentlemen, of wh.,m they had resolved to leave none alive. On this news reaching the ears of the gentlemen they left their respective offices and fled. The mutineers killed all they could catch. Some got hidden among the honses. The greater part rushed to the magazine and closed the gate. About 3 in the afternoon the gentlemen fired a shell from the magazine, which killed and wounded a vast number of the crowd. The report shook the houses as if a magazine had exploded. "About 10 at night two (pultans) troops of artillery arrived from Mleerut and entered the city, and fired a royal salute of 21 guns. Afterwards the troopers proceeding to the military cantonment (about 1 A, mile outside the city), killed a great nimber of the officers, and their wives and children, and set fire to the houses. " All the vagabonds of the city have joined the mutineers and are ravaging the city. " The next day, about 3 in the afternoon, the empire was proclaimed under the uing of Delhi, and the Imperial flag hoisted at the Kotwalee (chief police station). The King's chief police officer arrived; with him all the mutineers, horse and foot, and killed all the rest of the Europeans they met or found. Then guns were fired as a salate. The old chief of police fled. The macebearers stood aloof. Thou. sands of rupecs' worth of things were pilaged tiU 12 o'clock in the night. " There is now no ruler in the city and no order. Every one has to defend his house. An attack was made on the house of the great banker, Muragnee Pam, but he had assembled so many defenders that after much fighting the attack was unsuccessflaL Other bankers' (names mentioned) were pillaged. " The Delhi Bank was entirely pillaged. In short, within these two days hundreds of thousands of rupees' worth of property has been destroyed and stolen. No one can venture oat of his house. The King's officers have the control. The mutineers roam about the city, sacking it on every side. " The post is stopped. The electric telegraph wires have been cut. News is closed on all sides. " There is not an European face to be seen. Where have they gone or how many have been kiled? Hundreds of corpses are lying under the iagazine. The burners of the dead wander about to recognize the looked-for faces and give them funeral rites. I don't know whether I shall live to see the end of aU this. Hendreds of wealthy men have become beggars; hundreds of vagabonds have become men of wealth. When an heir to the city arises then the public market will be reopened and order be restored. For these two days thousands have remained fasting, such of the shops as are left unpillaged being closed. "W When anything further occurs I will writo again." The following is a letter written by an officer at ]Kurnaul, dated the 14th of May, 1857 "I have, by the blessing of God, escaped from Delhi unscathed, along with FaDny, and my dear littlo boy is safe (so I learn) at Meerut, along with some friends. I will just give you as short a description as I can of our sufferings and of the dangers we had to encounter. " You must know that at Delhi there were nothing but native troops-viz. :-three regiments of infantry and a troop of native artilUery. At Meerut (distance from Delhe about 32 miles) the 3d Native Light Cavalry mnutinied, and 90 odd men were sentenced to certain terms of imprisonment. "About 200 of the remainder, along with the 11th Native Infantry, rushed to the gaol and liberated the prisoners, and, after murdering several of the Europeans and setting fire to the houses in cantonments, cut the electric telegraph wire, and went as fast as possible to Delhi, where they arrived about 7 a.m. the following morning without our having heard anything of their coming. "As soon as possible the troops were ordered down to the city with soeie guns, our regiment beirng left to guard cantonments. Immiediately the 54th Native Infantry arrived in the city the men all joined the mutinous cavalry, and cut up all the officers, with the exception of two or three, who managed to escape ; the Artillery also turned the guns against us. Nearly all the 74th Native Infantry followed their example, and many of the officers of that corps were also murdered. A regular slaughter of all Europeans wathen comnmenced in the city- men, women, and children all shared the same fate. As I told you in my last, I had been iU in bed for a long time. and was to have left for England on the 15th, but God willed it otherwise. Seeing how things were turning, ill as I was, I could not remain quiet, and forthwith volunteered my services to the Brigadier, which he accepted with thanks. I joined the troops, bat after a long time it was agreed that we should retire, as all hope of holding Delhi was gone. Our regiment then refused to act, and most of the officers fled to Kurnaul, hieerut, &c., but I, along with a few others, agreed to stay with the troops as long as possible. I placed rmy little boy in charge of some friends, who took him away in their carriage in safety to Meerut. I then placed Fanny and our doctor's wife in a buggy, and directed them to go as quickly as possible to Kurnaul. Our doctor, who was severely wounded, accompanied them in his gbarrie, but unfortunately they were all robbed on the road, and everything taken from them, their gharrie and buggy being broken to pieces and the borses stolen. More about them after. After seeing them off I hastened to our Quarter Guard, where I rallied the men of my own companies, Nos. 3 and 5, and they promised to stand by me. I proposed to the commanding officer to call them together, but he would not permit me to do so. Of course, with this order I could do nothing. By degrees I and E Ensign - were left to onrselves in the Quarter Guard, when we agreed together to ride away with our colours to a place of security. The sepoys, however, refused to allow us to take them. - then leftme alone and has not since been heard of. Last of all, I persuaded the sepoys to let me take the regimental colour, and I took it outside, but on calling for my groom I found he had bolted with my horse. You may imagine my horror at this. I went back into the Quarter Guard and replaced the colour, but on again coming out a trooper dismounted and took a deliberate shot at vme, but, misssing his aim, I walked up to -him and blew his brains out. Another man was thentaking aim atme when he was bayonetted by a sepoy of my company. The firing then became general, and I was compelled to run the gauntlet across the parade ground, and escaped unhurt miraculously, three bullets having passed through my hat, and one through the skirt of my coat. The whole of the houses in cantonments were burnt. Having gone as far as my weak state of health would permit, and being exhausted, I took refuge in a garden under some bushes. About half an hour after a band of robbers, looking out for plunder, detected me, robbed me of my rings, &c., and only left me my flannel waistcoat and socks. They then tore off the sleeve of my shirt, and with it attempted to strangle mo. Imagine the intense agony I must have been in I They left me for dead, as I had become senseless. About one hour after I came to, and managed to stagger on about a mile without shoes, where I secreted myself in a hut antiil daybreak, when I resumed my dreary journey, and, after travelling about 12 miles, the latter part of which was in the broiling sun, without anything on my head, arrived at Aleepore. I managed to beg a little water, some bread, and a few old native clothes to oover my nakedness, but was refused shelter. Again, I went on and on through the p]oughed fields, barefooted, fearing to keep the road, on account of the robbers, and, after being turned from several villages' came to a village where the head man, much against the wishes of his labourers, offered to secrete me. This offer 1 accepted, and I remained with bim for five days, although once the Sirdars came there and wished to murder me, but, seeing my helpless state and how ill I was, they refrained from doing so and went away; and a second time I was forced to flee to the fields and hide myself , as about 50 of the matinous sepoys came and searched the village for Europeans, but, after lying the whole day in the sun, my generous friend the Zemindar came and fetched me. On the morning of the sixth day a man came in and gave me such information that I was confident that Fanny, the poor doctor, and his wife were within six or seven miles off. I at once determined at all hazards to go in search of them, and at once started off. I once more gained the high road, and, after making inquiries, found that those I was seeking for had been travelling on foot at night, and were about 10 miles a-head of me. With my feet swollen and in blisters I journeyed on, and at last, to my extreme joy, overtook them. After having been several times stripped and searched by the robbers, they had been taken care of by a Ranee Mungla Dabee for two days. They, poor helpless creatures, liko myself had been robbed of all they, possessed, the ladies, with the exception of a petticoat and shift, and the poor wounded doctor had his i clotheslefthim, as the blood had sosaturatedthemthat they were deemed uselees to them. The ladies also had exs perienced the most distressing and horrible insults. Attheo same place we also met Major Patterson, who had had two very severe blows on the head with a bludgeon. On the evening of the same day we resunmed our rmarch, but as poor Wood was so weak we only managed to accomplish about three miles, when we put up in a village for the night. The villagers treated us very kindly, gave us quantities of milk, bread, and dhal, and charpas to lie on. As soon as the moon rose and we had had about four hours' sleep we again went on our road; but this time we were more fortunate, as some men offered to carry the doctor in a bed. By this means we got on more quickly, and by the evening we had walked aboub 20 miles, and put up in a village where the people were very kind indeed, and in the morning conducted us safely on horses, males, and donkeys to a place called Lursowlee, about 30 miles from Kurnaul. Here was a police station, and we immediately sent on a man on horseback to Kurnaul to send us a carriage and cavalry escort, which was immediately done; and I thank God we arrived here safe on the night of the 20th. A force is collecting to march against Delhi, and will start in tbree or four days, when I trust everything will still turn out well; but everything looks so threatening, and several regiments are mutinying and going over to the enemy, that it is very uncertain how it will all end. When I shall come to England now is un. certain, and my movements equally so; but I asi not of a despondiog disposition, and put my trust in my Creator that all may still be well. " Everything I possessed in the world has, of course, either been burnt in my honse or stolen; and I have nothing left to myself and wife and child but the clothes we stand in, which have been made up here. " It is very doubtful whether this will ever reach you, as the villagers are burning all the post-bags; but yet it may. "I trust are this reinforcements are being sent oat from England to assist us. Ten or fifteen thousand men, at least, are required,without which I fear we shall be ansuccessful."
MR. S. G. OSBORNE AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. -i TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMtES. Sir,-The letter of your correspondent, Mr. S. G. Osborne, in ) he Times of to-day, contains, like every other from his pen, a great deal of good sense put in that striking way which rarely fails to carry his readers away with him. WYhat he says about the industrial training which may be provided in every -private family of the richer classes is perfectly true. There is no school like an actual apprenticeship. The misfortune is that if your correspondents suggestion were attempted the servants' hall would in most instances burst into a mutiny. True, in great houses "Jeames" performs many of his duties by the agency of dirty Dick, for a consideration of broken victuals and other smaU perquisites ; but the relation between these two functionaries is of a delicate and confidential character, not always advantageous as a moral training, and certainly not such as would bear the eye of a philanthropic master. I fear that there are few households where the practical educationist would not find himself reduced in a few weeks to depend on the services of his neophytes for the brushing of his coat, or the scorching of the mutton chop which has perforce succeeded to more elaborate dishes at his dinner table. However, I wilL readily allow that every single instance in which he succeeds is a gain; and all that I ask is that before industrial schools are condemned we should wait and see what success may follow private enterprise. With the tone of another part of your correspondent's remarks I have much more fault to find. I entirely deny that the object of educationists during the last ten years has been to give instruction of too high a character to the working classes, or that this has been at all a common result. The '' ologies," as they often are facetiously called, may, no doubt, become in the hands of an unskilful teacher a mere coUlection of scientific facts unconnected with one another, and poured into the maemory of a child like water into a cistern. But blundering of this kind is not confined to elementary schoolmasters. W'ho has not often suffered from the conversation of well-informed young ladies who have been drenched with Pinnock's catechisms, or of intelligent young Scotchmen whose courses of lectures had comprised every topic not of human interest? But in the hands of a man who understands his work science in the elementary school or the mechanics' institute is nothing more than common sense methodized. Why should we not teach Hodge to use his eyes on the objects around him, because his sphere is a narrow one ? Why should he not understand how his wife saves money in tea and coals by keeping her teapot and the top of her teakettle bright ? Why should Dorothy not be aware that in nursing her child in scarlet fever she should place herself between the door and the patient, and not between the patient and the fire; or that to freshen the sick room she should open the window at the top as well as the bottom? The husband and wife may be made to understand these and hundreds of analogous facts in an hour, but the interpreter will (Ihorresco referens) have been teaching them nothing less than pneumatics! No exploded faUacy is more absurd than the notion that by sharpening the understanding of a poor man, and giving him healthy food for it, you render him discontented with or unfit for his station in life. WVhat you do really is to furnish him with a means of harmless enjoyment, to neutralize to a certain extent the impulses of his animal nature, to provide a rival to the attractions of the beershop or the brothel. No man can always be at work or asleep; and in his leisure ti-me nature will imperiously demand some excitement or other. Is that excitement to be one fitted for a man or a beast ? I wish some of those gentlemen who are disposed to ridicule attempts to elevate the tastes and enlarge the apprehension of the working classes would set themselves to consider what answer is to be given to this question. An ancient philosopher, who had thought as much on the matter as the whole Committee of Council put together, tells us that the most difficult problem a statesman has to solve is to get a people to pass their leisure time well. - - - I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. W. B. ou1y it.
CiRCUMISTANTIAL EVIDENCE.-Dr. hletcher, mimister of Finsbury Chapel, London, narrates the following in regard to the case of Eliza Fenning, referred to by the Dean of Faculty in his defence of Miss Madeleine Smith: -" A considerable number of years ago I was sent to visit on a Sabbath-day Eliza Fenning in prison, who was sentenced to be executed on the following Mlonday in the front of Newgate, and who was found afterwards-alas ! though too late-innocent of the crime. She was executed for a deed she never committed. In company with the Ordinary of Newgate I conversed and prayed with her. She was dressed in white, an emblem of her innocence. In the same garments she suffered death as a criminal on the foUowing day. I had no opportunity of judging as to her innocence. The expression of her countenance will never be erased from my remembrance. It is literally stereotyped upon my heart. From what was communicated to me some years after the fatal and melancholy event I can now explain the expression of her countenance. It was the demonstration of injured innocence ! When the eventof her execntion was almost forgotten, a baker, dying in a workhouse in the vicinity of London, said to the matron of the ward, or some other irdividual, to the following effect:-' My mind is heavily burdened. I cannot die until I make the followingcommunication:-ELliza Fenning died innocentof the crime for which she suffered. I am the murderer of her mistress. I put the poison into the morsel which effected her death.' On the trial the jury concluded it must have been the cook who had administered the poison, as they had not tho slightest clue to suspect the baker. Yesterday, in the vestry of nmy own chapel, one of my elders statedto mo that the baker was a relative of the deceased. There is no doubt that he accomplished his murderous purpose to gratify somae loug-cheriebed passion of revenge for an offence given him, real or imaginary, by the fated victim of his malevolence. Better that a hundred murderers should escape than that one innocent person should perish by 'circumstantial evidence."'

IBELAND. (FROM OUR OWIN CORRMPONxD,NT.) DlUBLIT, MONDAY MORNING. PrOGRESS OF liOI)AN OATHOLIO OPINION. Dr. M'Hale!'s modest attempt to exercise despotic sway in Galway by forcing the electors of the capital town to provide a resting-place for the sole of Mr. George Henry Moore's foot is hardly likely to bo more successful than the vain effort to thrist Captain Bellew down the throats of the county constituency. It is positively refreshing to read the manly expression of public opinion respecting archiepiscopal dictation embodied in the following extract from a Roman Catholic journal (the Galway Vi?mlicator), which has before now done good service in a similar cause:- " Though by the constitution and practice of this country non-residents and strangers, if otherwise qualifL6d, may represent any local constituency, yet such practice is looked on with much jealousy, and can only be justified on the plea of some existing necessity. Galway does not live under the iron of this inevitable necessity. We do not want adventitious strangers to represent us, and we are more jealous than any other portion of the people of Great Britain of our rights in this particular. We would not have George Henry Moore under any circumstances, even with a national league at his back, instead of the broken down remnant of a set of theorizing anarchs. Nor would we have George E. Moore, though the Archbishop of Tuam heralded his avatar, and a Eacro-sanot bodyguard of priests from Mayo followed in his wake. We are totally opposed to all the foreign influences which are brought to bear on electors. We utterly repudiate any means of swaying their votes, except by the personal merits of the candidate and the cause and principles with which he is identified. But George Hemy Moore throws himself on the clergy, not on the country. e belongs more to the League than to Ireland, and prefers his own leadership to the general liberties. Practical legislation he would mar by aplea of 'independent opposition;' and he dabs it patriotism to put his countrymnen outside the pale of Governmeat patronage -and the public service, thus nullifying the Act of Emancipation. Clever he is, but crotchety, while his ability is vitiated by his vanity. He would rule, bat take no counsel ; be of the Irish party, but only as dictator; and use religion, the land question, the'League, the priests, and Parliamentary opposition only as the stepping-stones for his own irrepressible andimmeasurable ambition. Certainly the intimidator of lIayo, the sanctioner of denunciations against Catholic freeholders, the stirrer-up of the fiercest clerical agitation ever known in Ireland, and the mere nominee of a clique, whether lay or sacerdotal, could never be the man for Gaiway." PILRTY RIOTS INI nERLAST. Some idea may be formed of the state of Belfast during the week just closed by a perusal of the subjoined statement and remarks of a local journal of Saturday, the Mercury:- " Belfast has been disgraced and life endangered during the week by a series of the most flagrant outrages that could be committed by any semi-barbarous ruffians. The pretext for these lawless outrages was the celebration of the 12th of July. Party animosity was thus excited, and every night since parties bave assembled for the purpose of marderingoneanother. Tho magistrates on Thursday took couasel tgether, and passed a very excellentresolution-ordering all publichouses in the disturbed districts to close at 7 o'clock each evening, under a penalty of 5t. We trust this will be rigorously enforced. We shali not step to inquire which yarty iS most traculent and savage-we care not what shades of criminality may exist between the Orange and the Green-it is a thorough disgrace to such a town as Belfast that innocent life is endangered by such murderous violence. The military have been called out nightly to clear the streets and to protect life and property. Three members of the police force are now in hospital, dangerously wounded, but we have not heard that any number of the leaders in these detestable riots have bleen made amenable. There i8s avast deal too mnuch tenderness displayed by the authorities towards such brutal rufflans. Theyought to be, when detected in their mur- I derous onslaughts, shot down like dogs; it is the sheerest nonsense to commence reading the Riot Act in the face of such desperadoes. The police and military have a rightto protectiou, and when called out to maintain the peaeo it ?'S a refinement of cruelty to require them to stand with arms in their hands to be pelted by a cowardly mob with whom they cannot grapple. When they advance the mob retreat; they escape up lanes and courts and byeways, to reappear as truculent and savage as ever. SExch murderous proceedings as annually characterize the July celebrations ought, surely, to have some weight with those among the higher classes of soeiety who countenance them and keep alive such deadly animosities. It Is all very well for the Rev. Dr. Drew to preach to the Sandy-row ruffians, and exhort them to remain peaceable, or for Lord Dungannon to recommend a festive hilarity to be observed in lodges; but, despite aU such exhortations, blood is annually shed, lives are lost, propertv is destroyed, the peace of the country is disturbed, the law6 are outraged-and, pray, who is responsible ? We say these leaders and abettors are responsible-who, be they Orange or be they Green, pander to a bloodthirsty feeling, keep alive detestable animosities, inflame passions they cannot control, and then leave their victims to their fate."
MIISS JESSIE M. J. WHITE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A letter in The Times of this day, signed " George Morant, jun.," of the date of yesterday, from Carricknmacross, reflects on the truthfulness of your Italian correspondenoe at Turin. The press of Piedmont and Paris had equally with your own correspondent represented Miss White as implicated with Joseph Mazzini in the recent senseless and deplorable revolutionary plots and outbrealcs in France, Italy, and Spain. Mr. Morant, jun., would have the British public believe that the exclusive object of Miss White's visit to Turin and Genoa was to gain an entrance into the medical and surgical profesion, denied to her in England; and that our ardent young countrywoman is now In durance vile under a false charge of political conspiracy against the,Piedmontese Government. lam far from wishing to prejudge the alleged complicity of the lady, and doubtless she will have a fair trial in Turin, and every proper protection from the British Embassy in that capital. But your readers ought not to be misled by Mr. Morant jun.'s assertions, nor the Piedmontese constitutional Government suffer unjust condemnation. Probably we shall be early enlightened by docomentary evidence and correspondence, which will reveal the true and full history of the late periodical insurrectionary movements. The coming trials of the conspirators in Paris and Turin, if not in Florence, will expose the abortive revolution in its sources. In the meanwhile, and without prejudice to Miss White, it Is only common justice to the Piedmontese Government to state the following notorious facts of that young lady's movements in England previous to her recent visit to Turin and Genoa. Miss White has been long the avowed London ally and intlmate friend of hI. Mazzini, acting really as his " secretary" in certain associations or societies, and collecting money for 'aiding the emancipation of Italy." Late in the spring of this year Miss White, in a provincial tour of England and Scotland, delivered lectures in several towns on 'Italian Emancipation," and collected money in aid of her then declared object. Mazzini was throughout her circuit the idol of her text, and in her fiery and extravagant declamation she denounced the constitutional system of Piedmont as a sham and an impediment to general Italian liberty. I extract from the NeccostUe C7ronrcfl, of the 8th of May last, the following passage from her third lecture in that town, to "crowded audiences," admitted, I beLeve, at the moderate sum of Is. per head:- "You cannot prevent a revolution in Italy; you can aid its sucess. Do you say this time is inopportune? Bid the starving man await his loaf of bread until the laws are bettered ! Will it succeed ? I cannot tell. I know not whether this generation of Italian martyrs wll ever enter into the promised land, but I know that while a son or daughter of Italian blood exists revolution will follow revo, lution until that promised land is entered, and the soil. unpolluted by the footstep of a foreign hireling, is their own by possession as well as bv birthright. Try, therefore, to restore it to them by peaceful means. It lies in your power so to do. Rich and poor, you can all assist, you can give each your mite. The working people of Hawick have sent Mazzini 271., Paisley 1001., Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Kilmarnock are still at work. I do not believe the people of Newcastle will be behind their Scotch brethren. Help for right's sake, for the sake of your own country, her commerce, and her peace. We, too, love peace, therefore we aim to avert the causes of war; but we love a true, lasting, sold peace, not the hollow counterfeit in which Europe is hushed to-day." Your provincial contemporary, in the report of Miss White's stirring oration, states that " the meeting was rendered doubly interesting by the announcement that Signor Aurelio Staffl, one of the Triumvirate of Rome in the disastrous year 1849, would address the audience." On her reIrmn to London from this mission of proselytism Miss Whitoe circulated reprints of her country lectures, and advertising her own residence in Knightsbridge as the "office of the fund." Ia the same document these subscriptions and fands are distinctly solicited, on the ground that they " may greatly contribute to the success of any Italian movement."FuLrther, Mlss White prepared the way for her provincial lecturing by letters from Mazzini in her favour, addressed to the "Branch Provincial Committees" of his London Society. gow, on Miss White's sabsequent arrival in Turin she was received by the Mazzini party as a heroine of the Italian causo, and serenaded as a Joan of Are or Maid of Saragossa. Can the British public marvel that, not confining herself to her medical education (if that was an object of her foreign residence), she finds herself in trouble. accused of complicity with the unfortunate victims of Mazzini's schemes for the liberation of Italy ? But Miss White will be tried under the constitutional forms of her own country. Piedmont is copying the institutions o England, and the sympathies of its Sovereign and of Count Cavour will bo in her favour. 'Under these circumstances, the public may patiently wait the result of the lady's trial; certainly this case of our countrywoman ought not at present to excite any prejudice against a friendly foreign Government. In the meanwhile the friends of Miss White need fear no serious peril to her under any result. Her safe return home, if not with an acession of wisdom and eiciueal experience, may be safely anticipated after she penance for any acts of folly she may have committed. I am: Sir- Sin.

ELECTION COM3TTEES. The General Committee of Elections yesterday nominated the foUowing committeo:- IPSWICIL-Mr. Henry AustinBruce, Mr. John Hatchell, MI{r. Rainald Knightley, the Hon. H. G. flddell; Chairman, Lord Stanley. MALDOIT At the sitting of this Committee yesterday Mr. G. W. Digby, the agent of Mr. Western, who had been examined on Saturday, was cross-examined by Mr. . JAms,-He repeated his statement that Mr. Western had no committee, and said, with reference to an item in the accounts of eight feet of hat rails and a dozen of hat pins, that those articles had been provided for the use of his clerks and of the persons who came into the rooms he had hired to talk over various matters. On re-examination by Mr. Prsn;,N he said there were sometimes as many as nEfty peopl in the rooms at one timefrequently more thau a dozen. MT. John Payne, Mayor of Maiden, examined by Mr. Pns?r, said, that he did not appoint an election auditor at the last election. Cross-examined.-He did not take ant active part in the election on behalf of Mr. Western. He had canvassed no voters. The overlooker at his farm lent a horse and cart to take some voters to the polL His son seconded Mr. Western at the nomination. MIrs. Rebecca Wright, wife of the landlord of the Wellmngton, at MaIadn, said, that on the evening of the nomination Mr. Riley requested her to provide a room for a party that he intended to bring on the following day. She did so, and the next day Mr. Riley brought about 20 people to the Louse. They had a round of beef and some ale. No persons except thoso who belonged to Mr. Riley's party bad refreshment, that day at theWellington without paying for them. The bill of Mr. Riley's party came to about 5L. It was not yet paid. She took altogether about 161. or 171. on the day in question. That was not an unusual amount, for she frequently took as much or more on fair da] s. On cross-examination she said, that Mr. Riley's party remained at her house the greater yart of the day, bat were not eating and drinking all the time. She had not yet made out Mr. Riley's bill. Bythe Co2aTrnm.-Mr. Riley was a miller, and her husband had dealt with him for food for the horses. In answer to fhrther questions byMr. SrLADE she said, she had not pressed Mr. Riley for the money. She did not know whether her husband owed Mr. Riley money. Mr. David Wright, landlord of the Wellington, corroborated the evidence of his wife, and said, that he had not supplied any food or drink on the day in question which was not paid for. Cross-examined.-He voted for Mr. Western. On the polling day he saw Mr. Western at his house. Two persons employed at MrI. Western's rooms during the election were calledi to prove that Riley had only been seen once at those rooms-that was on the Thursday previous to the election. M1r. Digby, jun., the election auditor and son of the agen of Mr. Western, said, that both parties had had equal facili. ties of access to the election accounts at all hours. Be denied that there was any ground for the imputation that he had tampered with the accounts. He had accompanied ir. Western on his canvass. He had heard Mr. Western say he would rather lose the election than be returned by illegal means. By the CH,fIMI,u.-He was in partnership with his father, who had directed him to act as Mr. Western's ag-ent. Thomas Clarke, farm bailiff to Mr. Alfred may, said, that on the polling day he had provided a breakfast for 12 at the farm. All the party but one were voters. He provided the breakfast himself without any authority from Mr. May. He had not been paid for it. Cross-examined.-He was not a voter. He was married and his wages were 15s. a-week and 5s. or 6s. extras. He had Eeen MIr. Western canvassing with Mr. May. By the CHATh3XA?T.-He had himself invitea the men to cometo his honse. Ho told them he would give them some meat and beer and take them to Maldon. Mr. Alfred May said, the breakfast had been provided without his permission or authority, andhehad paid nothing nor did he intend to pay anything towards the expense of it. Cross-exanined.-His bailiff had never done such a thing before. Mr. Sutton Western, the sitting member, was then caled and examined by Mr. PuN.. e said, his father had considerable property in the neighbourhood of the borongh. He had commenced his canvass of the borough on the death of Milr. Lemmard, its late representative. Mr. Digby, senior, -was not his private solicitor but his election agent. He placed great confidence in Mr. Digby, and he told him previous to the election that he would have no illegal practices resorted to, and he should look to him to be protected from iany such practices. He had paid Mr. Digby's bill for the expenses of the election, and he did not intend to pay anything more. On the polling day he went to the Wellington because he was told that there were one or two voters there who would support him, but who w;ould not go to the pol unless he canvassed them. He went into a room at the Wellington where seven or eight men were sitting round a iable.A cup or two were on the table, but there was nothing like general drnking going on. He asked whether there was a voter present who would vote for him, and the men pointed out one person as a voter. He asked that person for his vote, and obtained a promise of it. He know nothiing whatever about the treating which had been attributed to Mr. This being the close of the evidence in defence of the return Mr. P=riT addressed the committee on behalf of the ditting member. Thse learned counsel went through the evidence given by the petitioner, which he characterized as "frivolous," contending that the allegations in the petition had not been proved, and that a complete answer had been given to the petitioner's case. Mr. SLADE replied upon the whole case, dweling particularly upon the facts which had been given in evidence with regard to Riley, and insisting that the agency of Riley bad been established. The committee deliberated for about an hour with closed doors, but at 4 o'clock adjourned until 12 o'clock this day without having come to a decision. WEYMOUTH. This Committee met again at 12 o'clock yesterday. Mr. Joseph Harden, the auditor of election expenses, stated that hir. Campbell's expenses amounted to 59d1., and that money had been placed in the bank to meet the bils sent in to him. The accounts contained items of travelling expenses. There were three Items of 1SI. 9s., for bringing voters from Newcastle, two of 21.10s. 6d. for bringing voters from Hartlepool, and other charges of a similar mature. Israel Jones, a voter, was then examined by Mr. CLAItx, and stated, that a few days before the election an execution had been put into his house by a baker for a debt of 41. 8s. The bailiffs name was Allen. Not having the money to pay the amount, his wife, at his desire. applied to Mrx. Howard, the solicitor, for aesistance. r. Hovward's clerk then came to his house, and brought 21. 10s. Witness signed a note of hand, and made up the rest of the debt, and the execution was withdrawn. Two days after the date of the note of hand it was paid by witness, and he now produced the receipt, Cross-examined.-The money was not lent in order to influence his vote in any way. He was a carpenter, and he frequently worked out part of his rent. Mrs. Jones corroborated her husband's statement. She had never seen Mfr. Howard canvass, nor heard him ask for her husband's vote. A mariner named Planter, who had voted for Preestun and Campbell, admitted that he might have eaid he would not vote unless his expenses at the previous election were paid. Mr. Aylesbury, a tailor, proved having heard Planter say he would not vote untU his expenses at the last election were paid; that he had come from Dover, and that it was a shame that he had not been paid. Cross-examined.-His name might have been upon Mr. Butt's committee. He had not promised a voter a situation on a steamboat if he would " lunp" for Mr. Bust. t e had asked a tenant of his to vote for Freestun and Butt, but he had not threatened to turn him out of his house unless he did so. His tenant voted for Freestun and Campbell, and was still in his house. Christopher Besseil, a shipbuilder, and part owner of some vessels, stated that on the Monday before the election ho met Atwell, who told him he had come from Hull to vote. but he should not vote unless Planter were paid. He had also heard Planter say he should not vote unless he were paid. He had heard a man named Pitt tell Planter that it sbouldbe "all right," and he afterwards saw Pitt and Atwell go into a room together. Atwell after that went into a room upstairs with Planter. When Atwell and Planter were together he stood at the foot of the stairs, aud he heard the sound of money, which, from the chink, hithought was gold. They were in a bedroom, eight or nine steps from the place where he was standing. Witness afterwards asked Atwell how he was going to vote, and Atwell said, as they had made Planter right he should not vote for MIr.Butt. Witness said he was sorry Atwll had broken his word, and Atwell said there was no help for it, as Mr. Tiazard had promised to buy a ship, which he named, and to give him the command. Planter and Atwell voted for Campbell and Freestun. Vii cross-examination the witness said, he supported and plumped for MIr. Butt, but denied having given a man 41. to vote for Mlr. Butt. By the Coin,rTTEE.-Atwell did not get the command of the ship, as it was bought in, Two otherwitnesses were examined with reference to this case, but stated notbing of importance. W. Coleman, who had served Atwell with a copy of the Speaker's warrant on the 20th of June, said, that when he preduced the warrant Atwell said he was about to leave Weymouth. He then served him with a notification not to leave England. Cross-examined,-Be bad heard that Atwell's vessel was poimg to sail for Stettin about that time. He suggested to Atwell that he ought to remain, and told him that no doubt his expenses would be paid. Ann Bridle said, Mr. Campbell had canvassed her husband. Before the election she gave a frock to the daughter of her brother-in-law, a baby in arms. On cross-examination she said the child had been brought up under the Speaker's warrantto supportthe case of bribery. (Laughter.) It had been said that Mr. Campbell gave the child the frock, but there was not a word of truth in the statement. Two other witnesseswere caUed to speakto this ase, from whom however nothing of importance was elicited. Isaac Jerrold was then caUed.-He said he was a hairdresser at Weymouth, and that before the election he had aik-ed a voter named Langford to vote for Mr. Butt. Lan ford said he could give no decided atswer, as MIr. Campbel had been twice to him. A day or two after the election Langford came to his shop, tok out a purse, and paid him a penny for shaving. (Laughter,) willham Langford was next examined-He said he had voted for Campbell and Freestun. He had had parochialreief and was in debt. Att the election a subscription was raised for him at the George, and he received some money from his brother and from some people at Weymouth, and he paid some of his debts. On cross-examination the witness said, he had not been bribed. He had not voted for Mr. Butt because bo thought that a servant of Mr. Butts, who had got up a subscrpltion for him, had improperly deprived umm of some oE the mOoney. The wlfe of the last witness was also examined, and The Committee then adjourned until this day. FALKIRE BURGHS. The Committee met yesterday at 11 o'clock, when the chairman (Sir J. Pakington) suggested to the counsel for the sittingmnemberwhether they ought not to consider how far t were able to rebut the evidence already given on bel of the petitioners. To save ti ne and trouble they maight now, if they pleased, have an opportunity of answering the statements of the witnesses on the other side on the distinct understanding that, if they suceeded in reiitting the evidence already adduced, the petitioners would be allowed to proceed with their case.

TO THE, )DZITO OF THEB TmES. Sir,-As it is expected that the subject of Education for officers of the Staff will soon bo discussed in the House of Commons, will you allow me, through the mediux of your columns, to correct a mistake in the Report of the Com. missioners ? A careless and not unimportant misprint has almost turned into nonsense some expressions of Iientenant-General Shaw Kennedy, C.B., to whose opinion on the importance of Staff Education the Commissioners very properly attach great weight. In page xzxviii of the Report, the last line (which as it stands at present is simply nonsense), should rtm thus :-' The only practical mode of abating or overcoming this most serious evil is that of having a highly instructed and efficient Staff." In the third paragraph of the samo page the words " a very" are also a misprint for " every." Many old soldiers who attach its proper weight to General Shaw Kennedy's opinion will be glad to see his words (which the printer has turned into nonsense) as they were originally written. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. EMIERTUS.
I TO THE EDITOR Op THE TIMBS. Sir,-With reference to a letter in Vie Tirna of to-day from Mr. Watkin, M.P., the manager of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company, alleging that "the Secretary of the London and North-xWestern Railway distinctly declined on the 16th of June to agree with the Secretary of the ShelIeld Company on any off icial minute of what then passed," and "protesting" against the minutes, as published, of meetings held on the 12th and 16th of June as "cz parlc," and also as "totally misrepresenting, misstating, and omitting mention of what actually took place ;" I beg to state- L That no communication of any sort upon this or any other subject took place between me and the Secretary of the Sheffield Company on the day named by Mr. Watkin; nor have I had any communication with him on any other day with reference to minutes of the interviews in question 2. That the notes of the interviews on the 12th and 16th of June, as pLblished, were duly submitted to the Directors and general manager of the Midland Company (three of whom were present on the 12th, and four on the 16th, as "friends of both parties"), and they unanimously approved them as fairly representing what passed at the interiews of the 12th and 16th of June.

ARCHIxECTuRAL M lUS=f, SoUTH KWSINGTOu' -The annual conversairnc was held on Saturday last at 8 o'clock. The visitors were more numerous than on any previous occasion. The Chairman, the Earl de Grey, President of the society, opened the proceedings by congratulating the members present on their change of premises, and contrasted their conftned and dirty rooms in Cannon-row with the gallery in whichtheir collections are nowdeposited. His lordship successfully combated the objections which had been raised to the change of locality, and remarked that the number of visitors on the present occasion completely set aside the question of distance. Mr. Scott, the treasurer, was then requested to read his report. Mr. Scott observed that his report would not be of that financial character which might be expected from him as treasurer of the society, but would enter more into the proceedings of the committee during the year. A statement was then read, announcing the additions which had been made to the collection, and entering somewhat fully into the reasons for its removal to South Kensington. The determination of the committee to persevere in the task which they bad undertaken in establishing tho museam was being constantly strengthened by practical results, and any misgiving which might have been entertained as to the prudence of the removal of their museum hWd been entirely set at rest by a comparison of the number of vidtors, which had been increased twentyfold. Professor Donaldson, in moving the adoption of the report, dwelt upon the great advantages arising from the changes of premises, and from the association of the Architectural Maseum with the other departments in the building, while independent action and powers of control were secured to the committee. The professor concluded by presenting to the library of the Architect,iral Museum, on the part of Mr. H. G. Bohn, his new publication on Pouer-y and Porcelain. Mr. Powell seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. Mr. Scott moved a vote of thanks to the Committee of Council on Edueation for their general co-operation, and also for much personal attention on the part of Mr. Cole, Mr. Redgrave, Dr. Lyon Playfair, Captain Fowke, and Mr. Owen. The motion was seconded by Mr. Godwin and adopted. The following resolution was then moved by 3Ir. Cole:" That the best thanks of the members of the Architectural Museum be given to the officers of the society; to Mr. Scott, treasurer; the Rev. Charles Boutell and Mr. Joseph Clarke, honorary secretaries; Mr. Lomar, assistant secretary; and Mr. Allen, curator." Mr. Cole spoke strongly as to the high excellency of the Architectural Museum as a place of study, especially to art workmen, for whose use it had been mainly established, contrasting the specimens with those in the stal Palace, which, although more pleasing to the general public, were of incomparably less value to the sta. dent. The motion was ably seconded by Mr. S. C. Hall, and carried by general consent. The Right Hon. Silliam Cowper, MLP., Vice-President of the Council on Education, then moved a vote of thanks to the president, the Earl de Grey, for his conduct in the chair, and bore testimony to the value of such a collection as the Architectural Museum to the cause of education. The Rev. Dr. Whewell offered a few appropriate remarks, and concluded by seconding the resolution, which was carried by acclamation. By the kind permission of the Committee of Council the whole building was opened to the inspection of the visitors. TH, Rovm KmA STEAmEj PFRsIA-Tn AuÃ¯Â¿Â½gust last we reported the Persia's unparalleled trip from New York to Liverpool in 9 days 2 hours nd 40 minutes, or to the Bell-buoy in 8 days 23 hours and 30 minutes. This was considered the height of perfection in steaming, and nautical men at that time were sanguine in the belief that this speed could not be approached at any future period. We are, however, glad to chronicle another feat by this vessel. On Friday afternoon, at 20 minutes past 4, the Persia (hich started from Jersey City at 8 20 am. on the 8th of July passed the Rock Lighthouse in 9 days 1 hour and 15 minutes from New York, the difference of time between the two ports, together with two hours' detention off the barfor water, being deducted. The time occupied in reaching the Bell-buoy on this occasion was 9 hours and 35 mnutes, being 60 minutes longer than her trip last August, but shorter to the Hersey by 1 hour and 25 minutes. It will thus be seen that this is the quickest passage on record between the two ports. The first part of the passage was characteri2ed by lightvariable winds. During the last five days she experienced more favourable weather, during which time she ran 3,689 miles, being an average of over 14 mailes per hour. Our Transatlantio friends, whose praiseworthy exertions towards redeeming the tedium of a sea voyage between the United States and the mother country cannot be too highly commended, must henceforth yield the palm of unquestionable superiority to the Cunard Company, whose laudable enterprise has enabled them to produce a magnificent fleet of steamers only little inferior to the Persia in point of speed and seagoing qualities.-Lvcr-- pool Albion.

The only consolation we have iD re, cording or commenting upon them lies in the fact that pros bably in no part of the world are riots so little significative of the state or feelings of the comamunity at large-so entirely local both in their causes and in their results. An English riot implies, as a general rule, great and wide. spread suffering or discontent, so acute that the restraints of a strong Government and well-knit aristocracy arc insufficient to prevent its boiling over. A French irncute is either the herala of revolution, or the attempt of hordes of fanatics to break up the framework of society, and imposes uponthe nation,jer fas a'etncfas, the wildest"crazes" which the wildest imaginationscan conceive.

THAMfES CONSERVANCY BILL. Lord ST. LEONARD'S, in moving the second reading of this Bill, explained tho circumstances under which ib was introduced. At one time the city thought themselvs entitled to the bed and ehores of the Thames as far as the tidal waters fowed. This right was contested bythe Crown, and after sooe time an cgreement was come to, and was embodied in this Bill, by which all the rights of the Crown and of tho eity in the ibed and shores of the Thames were vested in s 3viard of Conservancy. If any objections were entertained ini reslect to the present measure they would probably relate to the constitution of the boa,d. The G overnmaeut and the corporation had thought it right to establish a new Eoard of Conservancy, to the powers of which, he believed, no fair objection could be made. The Bill p-oposed that that board should consist-of the following members :-ThoeLord Mayor for the time being, two alder. men, and four common councilmen; those aldermen and -common councilmen to be chosen expressly by-the common council as conservators. The other members of the board would consist of the foUowing persons:-Tho Deputy. Zaster of Trinity House for the time being, a conservato; to be named by the Trinity House, two to be named by the Admiralty, and one by the Board of Trade. It would he impossible-to name five persons more fitted to perform the duties of conservators. The BiU would not so much create new rights as transfer existing rights to a new body. Nothing was more reasonable than that the city corporation should have the majority proposed to be given to it by the Bill. The corporation had expended 50,0001. oat of theib funds In improving the River Thames, for which the) claimed no compensation whatever. The noble and learned lord concluded by moving that tho BiU be read a second time. Tho Duke of NEWCASTLE rose to oppose the Bill. 1e did not think that his noble and learned friend bad sufficiently explained its origin. When he was Chief Commissioner of Woods, about 13 years ago, contests were constantly going on between the Crown and the city of London with regard to the soil and bed of the River Thames. 'Having found that under the assumed jurisdiction of the corporation of London embankments had been made along the river Thames, in evasion, as he believed, of the rights of the Crown, and to the detriment of the public interests, he entered upon those lawsuits which had been going on fox a series of years since. These lawsuits had been prolonged by the legal technicalities of which the corporation re ,eatedly availed itself. In every one of those lawsuits whict bad been brought to a termination the verdict was in favoiu of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) The Government finding thal these suits led to great expense and were very protracted ))ad recourse last autumn or winter to a compromise, the basis of which was this,-that whereas the Crown claimed tc be the proprietor of the soil and bed of the river it should surlender sts rights to the city of London as conservators of the river upon condition that, whenever anysale'should take pl ICs or any license be given which produced money, one-third ol that money should bo paid to the Crown and two-thirde should be carried to the conservancy account. He did not wish to enter into the question whether that was a fair compromiso so far as the rights of the Crown wore concerned. Lie would assume that it was, and that the Commissioners of Woods had done perfectly right so far as that point was concerned. Bat speaking for himself, and he believed fox those who carried on these lawsuits after he left the office ol Commissioner of Woods, he might observe that the object in carrying them on was not so much to defend some pecuniary rights of the Crown as to protect on be, alf of the public the great highway of the country, and to place it under a better jurisdiction. Bat, so far frons that objeet being attained by this comn promise the conservancy of the river in which the pablic were so greatly interested would be handed over to that very body which he, as well as his successors In the office of Commissioner of Woods, believed to be incompetent. His noble and learned friend had said that no complaints were ever made of the manner in which the city corporation had disecharged the duty of conservator of the Thames; but, if he would refer to the evidence which was taken before the Metropolitan Improvement Commission some 12 or 13 years ago, he would find that there were numerous instances of such complaints. He did not mean to say that the corporation was charged with jobbing or any unfair proceed ngs; the complaints merely went to the extent of charging the corporation with having incompetently discharged the very important duty of conservator of the river. His nobleandlearnedfriend wouldhave theirlordships believe that the corporation had consented to sacrifice their rights by agreeing to let five nominees of the Crown Participate with them in the conservancy of the river, which office he said they had heretofore exercised without control ; but the truth was that ever since the commencement of the lawsuits which were commenced under his directions the conservancv of the Thames by the corporation had been entirely inoperative, so far as encroachments on the bed of the river were concerued; and for this reason-the Crown's right to the bed and soil was well founded, and had since been frequently established in courts of law. The river was at this moment like a vast sewer, and unless something were done before long to purify it it would engender some frightful plague among the two and a-half milihons of people who inhabited the metropolis. If they meant to intercept tbe sewage of that vast city they must embank the Thames in some way or other; but this Bil, by giving to the corporation of London the power of licensing encroachments on the river, would greatly increase the expense attending the future embankment of the Thames. It was a farce to call the proposed board an elective body, when seven members out of the entire 12 were to be composed of the lord Mayor, the aldermen, and common councilmen of the city of London. The question affected the whole of the population along the banks of the river between Staines and Yantlet Creek, and it was therefore absurd to confine the representation at the board to so small a portion of the metropolis as the city of Londoa proper. He did not make it a oharge against this body that it would job, but its functions ought to be entrusted to a board thoroughbly competent for the task. The Bil invested them with immense powers of taxation; it enabled them to grant licenses to persons wishing to erect piers or wharves on its banks, and it even placed the Trinity Board in subjection to this body of conservators. The future management of the river would be practically in the hands of the city of London, who would be entirely free from responsihility or controL The Board of Trade had presented a most excelent report, which was wholly adverse to this Bill, and it was therefore remarkable that the Government should support the measure. Moreover, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary for the Colonies were members of the commission which sat three or four years ago on the reform of the corporation of London, and one of the most prominent recommendations in the report of that commission was that the conservancy of the Thames should be taken out of the hands of the city of London and entrusted to a board of five members, ef whom the city of London should have the right of ap. pointing only one. Believing that the inhabitants of the metropolis at large would have just cause of complaint if this Bill were passed he begged to move that it be read a second time that day three months. Lord CAMPBELL, not being prepared to offer any opinion on the merits of the Bill, should abstain from voting upon it. Bet he must warn their lordships to look with some suspicion 6n-the connexion of the city of London with the conservaney of the river. When Attorney-General it was his duty to examine into the title of the city of London to the soil of the Thames, when it turned out that the5corporation were dejxorC the conservators of the river, bat that the soil belonged undoubtedly to the Crown. It would be much better that the right to the soil should remain in the Crown instead of being transferred to the corporation, because, although the city of London had In other respeots Kreat claims to the gratitude of the eountry, their conduct In regard to the conservancy of the Thames had ofteni been the subject of strong complaint. Earl GRANVILLE said, that the corporation of the city of London were by law conservators of the river. The Bill would put a stop to litigation between the Crown and the city, and would be an advantageous compromise on the part of the Crown, since one-third of the property arising from 0'e -ou wousA be- lande- ove to th Crin whf tw thirds would be applied by the new board towards the improvement of the navigation of the river. It was very -esirable that an end should be put as soon aspossible to the -questions in dispute between the Crown and the city, and he could assure the noble duke that the Bill would not inter'fere with any embankments that might be made. The Duke of NBWCASTLE thought the city had some reason for believing that they had gained an advantage over the Crown in this Bi. The Bill specifically handed over -the property an the shore and bed of the river to the mayor andcocrporation of the city. [ Earl Granville.-" Ascn servators of the river."] He maintained that the Bill handed over to the existing Conservancy Board, and not to he future board, rights which the Bill said in the preamble blonged to the Crow n. lord ST. LEONARD'S said that, before taking charge ef this Bill, he c-atisfiod himself tbat it was a proper measure to be passed. Tile Crown was to transfer its right to the 6o0l for a money consideration to be paid down, and a sum to be paid annuaDll. No doubt the BiU transferred the whole ght of the G-rown to the city in the first place, and then to the new body. The BiU would put a stop to litigation which bad lasted for Years, and which would prevenxt all improvement In theivyeruntil itwas put an end to. In his opinion it would be ampossible to constitute a-fairer body to arry out the objein which the promoters of the Bi had in view than that which the measure itself pro- The House then divided, when the numbers were- Ayes. ... ... ... ... ... 4 YMajority in favour of the second reading -39 The Bill was then read a second time.

TheEarl of DERBY presented a Petition againstitisigned i ay 13,000 of the inhabitants of Liverpool. comprising among their number 900 of the principal merchants of that city. The petitioners alleged that whereas the management Iof the Liverpool Dock estateswas at present vested in a body consisting of 24 persons, 12 of 'vhom wecre the representatives of the corporation, which wvas elected by the ratepayers generally, and the other 12 by the dock ratepayers, the Bill under the notice of the House proposed to alter the constitutional body and to form a new trust from which the corporation was to be altoether excluded. The petitioners then proceeded to urge their objections to that proposal, complaining that it would introduce into the management of the dock estate the principle of Government influence, and that it would in that and other respects operate as a great injustice, notwithstanding that the Bill containe no allegation of maladministration or breach of trust upon the part of the existimg management. They also complained of the appropriation of the town dues without the slightest compensation for such appropriation being made. They then went on to state that a measure upon such a subject ought to be a public and not a private BilL For the present he would content himself with stating to their lordships the allegations contained in the petition, reserving to himseh- the right of making such further observations as he might think fit upon the motion, which he understood a noble friend was about to make, to postpone the second reading of the Bill. The Duke of NEWCASTLE thought that after the decision which their lordships had arrived at with regard to the Thames Conservancy Bill it would not be necessary for him to trouble them at any length in asking them to agree to the second reading of the present BilL bhnt be would proceed at once to give some account of the origin of the measure. It would be unnecessary for him to go back to all the various transactions connected with raising dues upon shipping in Liverpool, or into the history of the legislation which had taken place upon the subject at successive periods. Their lordships, however, would recollect that in 1844, in consequence of a supposed inability on the part of Liverpool to supply the greatly increasing wants felt in different quarters, the BirkenhesadDock project was origisated, and applications connected with that project had been made to the Legislature in every succeeding year. In the year 1855 no less than four such Bils had been introduced, which had been classed in one group and referred to a select committee. After a careful consideration that committee rejected thore measures, and proposed certain measures as a compromise, and those were agreed to by the confficting parties, and last year a Bill had been introduced by the corporation of Liverpool to carry that compromise into effect. That Bill, however, neglected some of the most important provisions laid down by the committee, and upon its being referred to a committee it was negatived as being a breach of the conditions agreed upon during the previous year. A similar measure had again been introduced during the present year but fortunately for the interests of the public the Bil which he then asked their lordships to read asecond time had beea also introduced, and was promoted by the general commercial and railway interests affected by this question. He had been told that an attempt would be made to show that this Bill would enact with regard to Liverpool that which had been proposed by Mr. Lowe in the other House of Parliament with regard to passing tolls upon shipping. That, howvever, was not the cane, for the Bill introduced by the right hon. gentleman proposed to abolish passing tolls altogether, while the present Bill placed the collection of them in the hands of those whose interest it was to preserve them. With regard to the allegation that the subject was one which ought to be dealt with by a public and not a private Bill, he could only say that, in his oplnion it was fairer to all the parties interested to deal with the question by a private measure. The very objection which had been urged against the BiUl of Mr. Lowe was that it was a public Bill, and the noble lord at tbe head of the Government in withdrawing it had admitted that objection. He believed also that those who opposed the BiU would advance the suggestion that it was an act of spoliation, but he was prepared to show that Parliament had legislated upon cognate subjects in a manner much more stringent. Their lordahipa would recollect the Municipal Corporations Act, and he would appeal to noble and learned lords whether, at the time that Act was passed, it was not te opinion of the moat eminent lawyers of the dayh at t measure dealt with private property in the most absolute sense of the word. Three years ago a measure was passed which dealt with the Trinity Beard in a manner still more strongly. It not only diminished their rights and interfered with their revenues, but it introduced that principle of central control which had been so much objected to, and that to a much greater extent than was effected by this Bill; for, while only three out of the 21 members of this board were to be nominated by the Government, the Trinity Board was in most material respects placed under the control of the Board of Trade. There was no foundation for the assertion that this was a measure of spoliation, because this was not private property in the sense in which it had been asserted to be so. For a long time the Liverpool corporation regarded themselves as no more than trustees of the fund for shipping purposes, and considered only the surplus, if even that, as applicable to Ithe wants of the town. The time had come when It was absolutely necessary to carry out the recommendations of the comrmittee over which Mr. Labouchere had presided, and to constitnte a trust elected by those interested in the docks. There was a great accumulation of authority in favour of the Bill, a great number of petitions had been presented praying that it might p as minto law, and he could not believe that there would be any serious attempt made now to obstruct its further progress. He hoped, therefore, that their lordships would consent to send the Bill to a select committee. The noble duke concluded by moving the second reading of the Lord RAVENSWORTH rose to oppose the Bill, as being a violent and arbitrary measure, at variance with the existing law of the land, and with the great principles of justice which ought to regulate aU proceedings of this kind, and subversive of the rights of property. It was truo that the BiU had passed the HEuso of Commons without any serious opposition, but its progress had been attended with very peculiar circumstances. When intorests of this magnitudo were to be considered he did not know that there was a worse tribunal than the House of Commons upon the second reading of a private Bill.Hon. members were anxious to get to the public business; it was supposed that the subject would be thoroughly considered by the committee upstairs ; a buzs of impatience generaUy went through the House, and the greatest desire was expressed to dispose of the measure. Mr. Mimer Gibson, when the second reading of this Bill was proposed, said the HEuse would not affirm the principle of the measure by assenting to the second reading. Yet what took placo in the committee ? There the chairman stated that tho committee would probably have entertained a pecuhar difficulty with regard to the principle if it were not that that principle had already been adopted and sanctioned by the House. As regarded the composition of these committees, members supposed to be particularly interested in the subject were not admitted to serve upon them, but this exclusion, in his opinion, was a piece of one-sided justice and partial impartiality; no precaution was taken against having as members, or even as chairman, gentlemen who had come to foregone conclusions on the subject of consideration, and it was thus possible that tho grossest partiality and injustice might be perpetrated. He contended that this was a measure of Spoliation. The principle of compensation was altogether ignored by the Bill, though it had been noted upon over and over again in similar cases by the Legislature. He believed that the object in proposing the Bil was to achieve a conquest over the corporation o Liverpool, which could not have been achieved if Liverpool had been joined with the other ports of the kingdom in a general Bill; and when that conquest over Liverpool was effected the other ports would be dealt with in succession in a similar manner. The noble duke had said that the corporation of Liverpool had neglected the interests of that port; but if that were so, how did it happen that the shipping of Liverpool had increased so enormously, and that her new docks extended several miles ? The noble duke had given no good reason why their lordBhips should assent to the second reading of a private Bil which interfered with important objects, and menaced the security of the property of every corporation in the kingdom. He begged, therefore, to move that the Bill be read a second time that day three months. Lord WENSLEYDALE (who was very indistinctly heard in the gaUery) said that he felt it his duty to oppose the second reading of this BilL The measure was one which their lordships' weU known regard for the rights of property should induce them to reject. The right to these tolls wa3 originaly granted by the Crown, and the mere fact that the revenue raised from them had enormously increased in no way affected the validity of the title of their owners. This Bil involved principles which ought not to be introduced nto a private measure. The right of the corporation of Liverpool to levy these tolls had been established beyond all doubt, The total amount which they produced in thc year,- 1572 ^^w^as^ only 221. In JL84 they had inereased _t_o 100,00061, *an'd t-he'y no'w amounted to 150,0001. Ifthe corporation of Liverpool were to be robbed of this amount without compensation they would be obliged to impose a borough rate, the value of property within the borough would be diminished, and private interests would be injuriously affected, The Liverpool docks were commenced in 171O, when they occupied only five acres. They now covered an area of 200 acres and were 16 miles in length. Previous to 1825 they were under the sole management of the corporation, but in that year the merchants obtained a share in the management and were associated with the corporation in the dock trust. No complaint had been made that the dock trustees had failed to provide suitable dock a-commodation, and he could conceive no Parliamentary, or public, or reasonable ground for taking away so valuable a property from the corporation of Liverpol without compensation. (Hear, hear.) Ho thought he had stated to their lordships reasons sufficiently strong whythey should not read the Bill a second time. To do so would be, in his opinion, to act in violation of that great principle of our law by which it was provided 'hat no person should be deprived of his property without due compensation being made. (Hear.) The Marquis of CLANRICARDE contended that neither | the noble lord who had moved the rejection of the BiDl, nor -thea noble and learned lord who had just sat down, had furnished any grounds which would justify their lordships in dewnAtiag from that course which in relation to private Bils they uniformly adopted. Those noble lords had, Iudeed, maintained that the measure before the HRwse would affect the rights of private property; but was not that, he would ask, the case with every meure of a private character which came under their lordships' consideration? (Hear, hear.) He should also beg their leordships to bear in mind that the committee of the other Houase of Parliament to which this Bil had been referred had Aeemed it to be their duty to sit for 25 days in order thoroughly to investigate its details; that Mr. Hope Scott and the leazued gentleman who bad been opposed to hio;- had each occupied two days in commenting upon its ps visions and in summing up the evidence, while their ias2dshi a sought to dispose of the whole question in a desul- ory den,ate of two or three hours. (Elear, hiear.) Now, he was well aware that the noble lord who had moved the rejection of the Bill was capablo of speaking for two days if he choso (laughter); bat then, he had confined his observations within a very much narrower limit ; and ho (tho Marquis of Clanricarde) could not help thinking that a measure wlth respect to which the committee had taken so long a time to deliberate could not be satisfactorily dealt with in a few short speeches of that description. He must also maintain that the principle of compensation which it was said was involved in the Bil was one which their lordships were night after night in the habit of referring to the consideration of a select committee. The Bill, however, involved something more than the principle of compensation; it embraced the question of the conservancy of the river Mersey-a question of the utmost importance; one in which the commerce, not only of this country hut of the whole world, was concerned. Would their lordlships then deem themselves justified in the summary rejection of a measure of that nature upon the ground that it interfered with private property without, at all events, taking the necessary steps to ascertain to what extent that property would be affected9 The fact was that the members of the corpoTation of Livorpool seemed to have got the notion into their heads that the trade of the Mersoy should be carried on for the special benefit of that town, but he trusted their lordships would, by assenting to the second reading of the Bill, and its subsequent reference to a select committee, show that they were prepared to take a somewhat different view of the subject. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY said, that if the Bill had been one of an ordinary character he should concur with the noble marquis who had just spoken in the opinion that it was desirable it should be referred to a select committee. He was Erepared, however, to urge a departure from that course, ecause he maintained that their lordships, and not a select committee, were the proper judges of the principle involved in a measure, and because, notwithstanding anything which the noble marquis might urge to the contrary, the principle which was contained in the Bill under their lordshipa' notice was one which he (Lord Derby) had never known to be embraced in any private, and hardly in any public enactment-he meant the principle of taking away private property without affording compensation. (Hear.) There was one point connected with the subject to which he could nothelp referring, aed that was thatthe Government, deviating from the ordinary course with regard to private Bills, had exercised their influence more or less to tarn it into a party question. He felt bound to deprecate such a course, and to assure their lordships that it had not at least been adopted by noble lords on the side of the House on which he had the honour of sitting. The noble marquis had referred to the magnitude of the interests involved in the Bill, bat he would beg their lordships to remember that those interests had acquired that magnitude under the management of that very body whom it was now sought to oust from their position. Why, the increase in the ort of Liverpool had been perfecbly marvellous. 1710 the docks extended over five acres, in 1811 that had increased to 30 acres, and in 1856 to 208 acres, while the number of ships had in the last 100 years increased from 1,731 to 22,032. Then, with regard to the purchase of the Birkenhead interest, did not the noble marquis know that at the time that interest was purchased the whole concern at Birkenhead was in a state of irretrievable bankruptcy, caused by entering into competition with Liverpool, and that the sole object of the purchase was to save an enormous quantity of property which would otherwise have been absolutely thrown away ? So much for the grasping views of Liverpool with regard to Birkenhead. (Hear.) The noble and learnedlord opposite had entered so fully into the legal claims which existed with regard to the town dues that he would not dwell upon that subject further than to say that those claims were perfectly undisputed; they had been made the subject of family settlements and of mortgages, which Par. rtament had sanctioned, and they had been judicially recognized in the courts of law; and yet the present Bill proposed to take away those rights, and that without compensation. It had been said that the corporation of Liverpool had dealt in an ungenerous way as regarded the matter of land, in order to increase their own corporate interest ; but was that really the case? Why, the committee which had inquired into the whole question had reported that they had incurred expense for docks, for the purchase of land, for the erection of the new Custom House, to an enormous amount, and had defrayed those expenses from their corporate revenuo. It was proposed by the present Bill to take awavy an undisputed right from that corporation of 100,0001. or 150,0001. a-year, without giving them the slightest compensation; the Bill was, in point of fact, the thin end of the wedge which it was proposed to introduce to carry out the principle of the general measure wbich the Government had failed to carry. (Eear, hear.) A Bill had been introduced last year by the right hon. the Vice-President of the Board of Trade the effect of which would have been to confiscate the property of the various corporations of towns throughout England without ving them any compensation; and perhaps their lordships ad not forgotten the extraordinary doenines which had been laid down upon that occasion by the right hon. gentleman-doctrines of such a character that even the political friends of the right hon. gentleman shrank from- de. fending them, and which approached almost to the old Socialistic motto, " La propriet-6 c'est le vol" (Hear, hear.) That Bill had been referrect to a select committee, which had proceeded to inquire into the case of Liverpool alone. In the meantime a private Bill was introduced by persons unconnected with Liverpool affirming principles similar to those of the measure which was withdrawn in the House of Commons. To this Bill the Government lent their support in order to carry out the principle in a private Bil with regard to one city, and thus to put at their mercy all other corporations. This was not a matter which ought to be referred to a select committee of five members. It was a principle on which the House ought to decide, and the proper stage at which to take its decision was on the second reading of the BilL The principle involved was the taking away of property from ndividuals or corporations by legislative enactment without giving them compensation. That was a principle upon which we had not acted either in regard to the Danish Sound dues, or in regard to pensions held by persons who had no right to them except that of prescription. The noble marquis had asked upon what ground those who opposed this Bill had on the present occasion departed from the usual practice of the House. He would not enter into the details of the Bill but if he did so he could show the gross injustice and manifest impolicy of many of its provisions. There was no allegation of mismanagement, no charge of abuse, no proof of injury done. On the contrary, the greatest advantage had been derived from the existing state of things; yet without any ostensible plaintiff tbey were about to take away the property of a corporation for purposes which he certainly did not believe were of an exclusively public nature. This was a departure from the invariable practice of that House, and to the affirmation of the principle involved in the Bill he could not with a safe conscience give his assent. Lord STANLEY of ALDEIRLEY, in vindicating the conduct of the Government in regard to this measure, denied that it was true, as had been stated by the noble earl, that the measure introduced last session for regulating passing tolls and abolishing local dues upon shipping wa3 rejected upon principle on the second reading. The Esrl of DERBY had not said that the measure was rejected. What he said was thatthere were such objections to it that the Government were compelled to withdraw it. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY.-The noble earl had saidthattheprinciplewascondemned. Thatwasnotso. The ground upon which it was referred to a select committee was that there were special circumstances connected with each harbour in regard to which it was necessary that evidence should be heard. Such evidence was heard in regard to the port of Liverpool, and in the present session this measure was introduced. It had two objects,-one to transfer the town dues of Liverpool from the corporation to the dock trustees ; and the other to vest the conservancy of the river and the management of the docks on both its shores in a single body, which should be elected by all those who contributed to the maintenance of the docks. and which should not be controlled and dominated over by the corporation of LiverpooL That the corporation of that place had dominated over the docks, and had on more than one occasion postponed the interests of the harbour to those of the town, it was not difficult to prove. How long was it before warehouses were erected within the hlmits of the docks, to which cargoes could be imumediately transferred from the vessels, because the inhabitants and corporation of Liverpool had warehouses without the docks into which they wished to drive all the goods which came into the port ? In 1824 there was a project for making a ship canal to conuect Wallasey pool with the mouth of the Dee. The corporation of Liverpool were alarmed at this scheme, and in order to defeat it they paid the promoters of it 180,0001. for land which he believed had not cost them 10,0001. There was some objection to this on the part of some shortsighted inhabitants of Liverpool, and Mr. Forster, the town clerk, said that the town council of Liverpool, as the protectors of the rights of the burgesses, could not expend their funds better than in preventing the establishment of a commercial rivel on the other side of the water. This showed what sort of a parent Liverpool was likely to be to Birkenhead. This purchase put an end to the scheme until Mr. Rendell drew up his plan for making docks in WaUasey PooL Liverpool applied to Parliament for powers to purchase the docks, and the select committee to which moer Bia was referred imposed upon the dock committee the obligation of refraining from spending money on the construction of the docks which they contemplated along the north shore until they had seen what Birkenhead could do to accommodate the increasing trade. Next year Liverpool brought forward a Bill for effecting this object, but of so inadequate a character that the select committee threw it outafter half-an-hour's examination of Mr. Rendell. This year independent parties, seeing that there was no chance of Liverpool carrying out the scheme, came forward and applied for powers for the purpose. The arguments by which this BiU was opposed were exactly those which were brought forward when the Municipal Corporations Act was under discussion. Then it was said that Parliament had no right to deal with corporate property without compensation, but Parliament did so deal with the property of corporations on that occasion, with these town dues among the rest, and Parliament had an equal right so to deal with them now. Nothing more was done by the Bill than to transfer these dues to the purposes for which they were orinally intended-the maintenance and improvement of the harbour. It had undergone very careful and laborious consideration before a select committee of the other House, lasting over 25 days, and he hoped their lordships would not consent to the motion for its rejection. Lord REDESDALE was afraid that, if In a private BIll they dealt with property in the manner proposed without giving any compensation, they would be establishing a precedent which might hereafter most 3njuriously affect private property. After a few observations from the Duke of NEwCASTLE in reply, Their lordships divided upon the question that this Bill be now read a second time. The numbers were- Contents .3 No.n-Contents ,, 5 Majority .1 5 ... ,, The Bill was then read a second time, ATLANTIC FELEGRAPH COMP&NY'S BILL. Upon the motion for the third readtng of this Bill, Lord REDESDALE called attention to the fact that, although the termini of the proposed telograph were bothin Her Majesty's dominions,-namely, in Ireland and in Newfoundland-tho American Government were to enjoy the same priority as the British Government with regard to the transmission of messages. It was said that this equal right was owing to the fact that a joint guarantee had been given by the two Governments. HIe thought, however, it woald have been far better policy on the part of Her bMajesty's Government if they had either undertaken the whole gaarantee themselves, and thus have obtained free and sole control over the connecting line of telegraph, or have invited our own colonies to participate inthat guarantee, rather than have allowed a foreign Government to join in making it. At the same time, if the clause in question had the sanction of Her Majesty's Ministry, it was not his intention to object to it. Earl GRANVILLE said, this telegraph was intended to connect two great!countries, and, as the two Governments had gone hand in hand with regard to the guarantee, it seemed only reasonable that both shonld have the same rights as to transmitting messages. The Bill was then read a third time and passed. THE BANKRUPTCY LAWS. Lord BROUGHAM said, he had given notice of caling their lordships' attention to the subject of the bankruptcy laws; but at that late hour (a quarter past 9 o'clock) he should certainly not enter into the s%bject at all. He would postpone his motion until Thursday next. He by no means intended to enter on Thursday upon the entire question of the bankruptcy laws, but merely to show the desirableness of effecting such alterations in the mercantile law as had been proposed by that association for the amendment of the law over which he had the honour to preside. THIIRD 1IEADTh GB. The following BiEs were then read a third time and passed :-Enclosure ACts Amendment Bill, Larceny, &a., ill, Offences Against the Person Bill, fMalicious Injuries to Property Bill, Forgery Bill, Libel Bill, Coinage Offences Bill, Deer, Game, and Rabbits Bill, Accessories and Abet' tors Bill, Crowded Dwellings Prevention Bill, Turnpike Trusts Abolition (Ireland) Bill. Their lordships then adjourned at 25 minutes past 9 o'clock.

Grosven-or, from inhabitants of London and the neighbourhood (nine signatures), for alteration of Dulwich College BiU. SHEPHERD'S DISABILITIES REMOVAL BILL. On tha motion for the second reading of this BUI, Mr. FITZROY said that he wished very briefly to direct the attention of the House to this class of BUls, whioh came to them invariably in the shape of unopposed Bills. The measure which it was now proposed to read a second time was, in fact, in the form of a petition from a clergyman, who having been ordained by a Protestant bishop in the United States of America, and being precluded by the existing law from holding preferment within Her Majesty's doDxinions, asked the House to remove his disabiUties, and to enable him to hold church preferment in England. assigning as a reason that his health had suffered from residence in America. It was not his (Mr. Fitzroy's) desire to oppose this particular BDl; but he wished to known from the Houso whether it was their pleasure that tho law of the country should be set aside whenever a clergyman appUed for a special Aot in his favour, or whether they would not prefer that some general Act should be passed to put aU on the same footing. He was not aware that any measure of this nature had been proposed previously to 1843, but they were now becoming of more frequent occurrence, and the present was the fifth BUI of this description that had been submitted to Pariiament. Having drawn the attention of the House to the subject, he wished to ask whether it was their desire that these private Bills should be treated in every case as unopposed estate Bills. Mr. C. FORSTER submitted that every case should bo decided on its individual merits, and urged that there could not be a stranger case for reUef made out than that to which the present BUI related. Mr. ESTCOURT said that he had brought in the first measuro of this description whioh had been submitted to the House, and although he had originally been met by a terrible array of opposition, he had at last suceeded in convincing them that the principle was sound aud that it ought to be agreed to. As the question which had been submitted to the House by the Chairman of Ways and Means was, whether they would in future deal with these as exceptional casta or whether they would pass a general Aot to embrace all, he must say that in his opinion the 26th of George IH. was a very good Act, and that he should objeot to repeal it, but as the cases which were brought before the House for special legislation wero case3 of great individual hardship, he considered that they ought to be decided upon their own particular merits. Mr. KINNAIRD concurred in tho principlo that when they had adopted a general Act of Parliament they ought notto be continually caUed upon to sanotion private Acts, the effect of which was to supersede the public measure. He was happy to bear testimony to the merits of Mr. Shepherd, but on pubiio grounds he opposed the present Bill. With respect to the last case, he did not suppose that a single member in that house understood what it was. The BiU passed through as a private BiU, though it practically repealed two Acts of ParUament. He therefore thou»ht that there ought to be some general legislation on the subject, and he for one would be glad to open the doors of the church as wide as possible; for why should allthe colonial clergy be excluded from the advantage which the present appneant desired to obtain ? Colonel W. PATTEN conceived that it would be rather hard to upset in the present instance a practice which had prevaded in other instances. It was objected that this was exceptional legislation, but hon. members would find on the paper of business for that day two divorce Bills, which also constituted exceptional legislation, as far as tho law of the land was concerned. If it were right to have general legislation on tho subject, that consideration ought not now to prevaU against the claim of an individual who was only asking for what had been granted in other cases. Mr. GLADSTONE thought the House had no choice but to pass the present BUI, as it rested on a series of precedents. He expressed his entire concurrence with the hon. member for Perth in the opinion that there ought to be some general legislation on tho subject. The Act of 1786 imposed a disqualification on Protestant clergymen in America to obtain ecclesiastical preferment in England which was not imposed onany other American whatever. A man might have been a Presbyterian, a Jumper, a Shaker, or a Mormon in Amenca, but if he came to England, were examined and found properly qualified, and ordained he might hold a benefice in this conntry. An Amercan Protestant Episcopal clergyman was, however, disqualified from holding a benefice in this country. In proof of this statement he mentioned the casa of a gentleman of the highest character and considerablo ability and attainments, who took ordera in the Protestant Episcopal Church of America; that gentleman subsequently became a Roman Catholio priest, aud afterwards left the Church of Rome and returned to the Protestant Episcopal Church; and though now desirous to bold preferment inthe established church in England, he was absolutely precluded from doing so, not because he had been a Roman Catholic pnest, but because he had been an American Protestant clergyman. He repeated that he thought there were grounds for some general law on the subject. Sir G. GREY said tbat the Act referred to by the right hon. gentleman was passed to prevent irregular ordination and inconvenient consequences which might affect the established church. He thought, as there were precedents, that this BiU should bo aUowed to proceed, for ho believed its rejection would be attended with great hardship. After a few words from Mr. Roebuck, The BiU was read a second time. HUNTINGDONSHIRE ELECTION.

PAKINGTON reported from the committee appointed to try the petition complaining of an undue election for the Falkirk district of burghs that thej had determined that James Merry, Esq., was not duly elected a commissioner, and that the last election for the said burgh was a void election. The committee had also agreed to tho foUowing resolution :- " That the said James Merry, Esq., was by his agents guUty of bribery at tho last election for the said burghs. "'That it was proved to the committee that Patrick Wingley was bribed by a payment of 10'. " Thatit was proved to the committee that a bribe of 20J. was offered to Richard Wigan if he would givo his own vote and secure tho votes of two other electors, named Wilson and Munro, in favour of the said James Merry, Esq. " That it was proved to the committee that a bribe waj offered to Thomas Wise, throngh hia wife. "Thatit was not proved totho satisfaction of the committee that these acts of bribery were committed with the knowledge or consent of J. Merry, Esq. " That J. Merry, Esq., was, by his agents, gmlty of treating at last election for the said burghs. _ " That it was not proved to the committee that such treating was committed with the knowledge or consent of the said J.

"That it was proved to the committee that the requirements of tho Act 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 102, were not complied with at tholast election for the said burghs, masmuchas no agent or agents for election expenses were appointed by the said J.

THE MUTINY IN INDIA. _ Mr. ROEBUCK said he wished to put a question to the nght hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Control -namely, whether ho was aware that an announcement had been made in one of the pubUo journals that a telegraphic despatch had como from Bombay stating that the army of Bombay had broken out into mutiny? He (Mr. Roebuck) wanted to know if Her Majesty's Government had received any information on that subject ? Mr. VERNON SMITH said neither Her Majesty's Government nor the Court of Directors of the East India Company had received any information on that subjeot. (Cheers.) Perhaps in the present state of tho pubUc mind it might ba desirable that he should state the way in which intelUgenco was bronght from India. Thero were two mails from India in the course of each month, and on their arrival at Suez they were conveyed to Trieste, and thenca a short account was sent to this country by telegraph, the mails themselves foUowing iu due course. Thero was no other mode of communication that he was aware of, and therefore he was at a loss to conceive how such information as that to which the hon. and learned gentleman had aUuded could havo reached this country from India. Ho (Mr. V. Smith) would be the last man to attempt to interfere with the arrangements by which inteUigence was transmitted to the pubUo press . but he did hope that in the presont excited state of public feeling in reference to the calamitous events whioh had oo ourred in India the editors of respectable pubUc newspapers would abstain from publishing rumours calculated to prejudice tho minds of the people of this country, unless they were assured in every instance of their perfect accuraoy. (Hear, hear.) He would only further add that at present he could not beUeve in the rumour to which the hon. and learned gentleman had referred, and that opinion was strengthened hy the impresaons he had received from the last accounts that had como into the hands of the Government. (Hear, hear.) HARBOUR OF REFUGE AT GREAT YARMOUTH. In reply to a question from Mr. Watkin as _to whether the attention of the Government had been directed to the importance and faciUty of making Great Yarmouth Hiven a harbour of refuge, JMr. WILSON said there was a committee now sitting on harbours of refuge, but he was not aware that they had signified any intention to cause an inspection to be instituted as to the desirability of making Great; Yarmouth a harbour of refuge. He behoved, however, witnesses had bean §xaJn,?*d before that committee who had Bpoken to that desirability. ASYLUMS FOR CRIMINAL LUNATICS. In answer to Mr. J. Ewart, Sir G. GREY said it was tho intention of tho Government to establish asylums to be exclusively devoted to the confinement of criminal lunatics, and a vote would be taken this session for the purpose. CAVALRY FOR INDIA. Captain VIVIAN asked the Under-Secretary for War whether it was tree that the order to send additional cavalry from this country, on account of thenews which was brought by the last maU from India, had been rescinded or suspended ? Sir J. RAMSDENsaid two regiments of cavalry hadbeen under orders for India for some time, and recently an order had been given for sending a third regiment, but that order had just been suspended. SAVINGS-BANKS BILL. The CHANCELLOR ofthe EXCHEQUER said, in reply to Mr. BAXTJER, that, considering the advanced period of the session and the state of the pubUo business, the Government had determined to withdraw the Savings-banks BiU, and he moved that tho order of the day relating to it be discharged. The motion was agreed to. REYISAL OF THE LITURGY. Mr. WALPOLE asked the noble lord the member for the county of Middlesex (Lord R. Grosvenor) whether at that late period of the session he meant to bring on the motion ?£ which he had given notice for Tuesday, the 23th inst.,-namely, fora commissionf or the purpose of considering whether the Uturgy of tho church of England was not capable of such modifications in its arrangements and services as would render it more profitable than it now was for the religious instruction and edification of tho people ? Lord R. GROSVENOR said he admitted that the 23th of. July was an advanced period of the session at which to bring on a motion of so much importance and novelty, and it had been his intention to withdraw it, but so much misconception prevailed in regard to the scope aud the objectof the motion that it would bo necessary for him to make it on that day; but should thero be any opposition to it he should not ask tho Houso to divide on the subject, but would in that case ask leave to reintroduce it on a future occasion. THE KING OF OUDE. Sir F. KELLY moved for "copies of any minute by the Right Hon. Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India, ?},?§, sl,SnatnK> of the treaty of 1837 with Mohummud AUie Shah, the then King of Oade; of the despatch from the Eight Hon. the Governor-General, announcing the negotiation of such treaty; of any orders from tho Secret Committee or from the Court of Directors of the East India Company to tho Governor General of India, abrogating or disaUowmg such treaty, or any part thereof; of any minute recorded by the Governor-General in CouncU on the receipt of suoh orders; of a letter written in the month of January, 1839, bythe Right Hon. Lord Auckland to the Hing of Oude on the subject of such treaty; and of a letter written in November, 1847, by the Right Hon. Lord Hardinge, the Governor-General of India, to tho Kinz of Undo. ° THE RUSSIAN TARIFF. Mr NEWDEGATE asked whether instructions had been sent to l.iord Wodehouse, requesting him to furnish without longer delay an account of the changes which had recently been made in tho Russian tariff ? Lord PALMERSTON said he had read a despatch which had been lately received from his noble friend Lord Wodehouse, in which he stated that the French translation, or rather the French edition of the Russian tariff had not then been published; but that as soon as it was published he would transmit it to tho Foreign-office without loss of time.

On the report of tho Committee of Supply being brough Mr. BENTINCK rose, in pursuance of notice, to caU tho attention of the House to the state of tho naval andmiUtary defences of the country. Referring to the discussion upon the subject on Friday last, the hon. gentleman said the answer of the noble lord at the head of the Government was unsatisfactory, and he wished to eUcit a clearer statement. He understood the right hon. baronet the First Lord of the Admiralty to have said on a previous occasion that we had not a steam line-of-battle ship fit to carry troops to tho East. He inferred that tho ships were not in a sufficiently advanced stato to bo employed at a few days' notico in the conveyance of troops, and therefore that the ships could not be immediately drawn out for the purpose of national defence. The noble lord at tho head of tho Government told the House that he saw nothing in the present state of affairs to necessitate or justify the calling out ofthe militia this year, but he did not teU the House what course would be adopted to make good the deficiency of troops which must be created by the necessity of sending a large number to India. The noble lord, with his usual frankness, saidhesaw no probability of any outbreak in Europe. No man was more qualified to give an opinion on such a point, but HUNTINGDONSHIRE ELECTION. Mr. WALPOLE reported from the General Committee ox.Elections that the following members had been chosen to try the petition against tho roturn for the county of Huntingdon:-Mr. Alderman Copeland, Mr. Joseph Looke Mr. H.

LABOUR IAV TLJfAICA. TO THE EDITOR. OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You may perhaps find a corner in The Tines for tho enclosed extract from a letter by the Lst mail of a resident proprietor in Jamaica. It gives a very different account of the command of labour which the planters in that island now have from that of the letter quoted by Lord Brougham in tbe debate in tbeHouse of Lords on Friday night laat,and the truth of the facts stated by my correspondent I wilt venture to say will be corroborated by every man who has a personal knowledeo of thA colnnvy I am, Sir. Tour obedient eervant w. Union Club, July 17. " We are in very serious difficulty for labour. I would give a hogshead of sugar and their wages to see 12 good stalwart African immigrants rescuinga lacre piece of very fne plants which a violent thunderstorm threw down 10 days ago. It is not possible to conceal that wages have risen, and that in the worst possible way-not an increase in money paid, but a decrease in the task performed for a shilling; and I am convinced that our best policy wll be to curtail the acreage in cultivation on this estate, as it will be impossible with the Creole Negro laboar at our command to take off the crop of a larger fie"
Th1 Q N OF THE NETERLANDs.-TheCountess Van Buren (Queen of the Netherlands) visited St. George's Hospital yesterday morning, and was condacted through the wards of that noble institution by a deputation of the governors. Her Majesty made several inquiries as to the mode in which the hospital was conducted, and on learning that the institution was supported by voluntary contributious generously left a sum of money with the secretary. The (Queen afterwards drove to Stafford-hoase, where, in the absence of the Duchess of Sutherland, who has left town for the season, her Majesty was received by the Marchioness of Stafford, who conducted her illustrlous visitor through the galleries and saloons of this beautiful mansion, and would have entertained Her Majesty at luncheon, but that the Queenwas engaged to visit the Duke and Duchess of Wellington at Apsley-honse, where Her Majesty arrived about 3 o'clock. OSn leaving Apsley-house the Royal party drove to the House of Lords, Her Majesty having expressed a desire to pay a second visit of inspection to that building ; returning from the House of Lords, the Queen caUed at Messrs. Garrard's, Crown jewellers, in Panton-street, and thence droveto Claridge's Hotel. In the evening Her MIajesty dined with her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, at St. James'sPalace, where the following had the honour of meeting the illustrious lady:-His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, his Serene Highness Prince Edward of Saxo-Weimar, his Excellency the Austrian Minister and the CountessD'Apponyi, hisExceDency the Mlinisterfor theNetherlands, the Earl Cadogan, the Earl and Countess of Sandwich, theCountess Granvifle, the Earl of Clarendon, the Earl and Countess of Shelburne, Lord and Lady Lyndhurst, and General Sir George Brown. Later in the evening the Queen and all the members of her suite honoured the Viscountess Palmerston with her presence at a grand ball given in honour of Her Majesty at Cambridge-house. CA.NvAssiNG.-The best defence of canvassingand, indeed, the only kind of defence that can be made for much of the old wildelectioneering-is, that canvassinghas, and the wild practices had, a tendency to keep up friendly, pleasant, and personal relations between classes. Redace everything to a matter of business and calculation, and half the old Englsh element in life is svrept away. It was "our old good bumour," as Clarendon calls it, which made our elections so many Saturnalia in former days, which uiade the old gentry popular where your modern millionaire is only feared, and which, if once it die out, can never be supplied. A man cannot scour his county on a hunter to canvass without seeing mnore of the people and being brought into closer relations with them than he well could be in other ways. The excesses of the old elections are to be avoided, but why should everytbing be swept away ? Abolish per. sonal canvassing altogether and the solemn prig stands as good a chance as the hearty and frnk man, not to mention that the gentlemen of the kingiom lose the advantage which a personal intercourse with the people wiU always give them over rsvals. -Quarterlp Reviewa. newnunmber. Af ELECIONBEB5~RG LN-CIDENT OF 1751.-It appears from the journals of the, 10th of May, says the Parliasncniary History, that one Thomas Long, gentleman. was returned for the borough of Westbury,in the county of Wilts, who, being found to be a very simple man and not fit to serve in that place, was questioned how he came to be elected. The poor man immedistely confessed to the House that be gave to Anthony Garland, mayor of the said town of Westbury, and one Watts, of the same, 41. for his place in Parliament. Upon which an order was made that the said Garland and Watts should repay unto the said Thomas Long the 41. they had of him. Also that a flue of 201. be assessed for the Queen's use on the said corporation and inhabitants of Westbury for their scandalous attempt.- Quarterly Review, new number. NEnY ZZEALAD.-The report from the Select Committee on New Zealand (the result of several divriions) is to the following effect:-" That, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, it is expedient that the gnarantee of the Imperial Government should be given to a loan for a sum not exceeding 500,0001., which it is proposed to raise under the New Zealand Loan Act, 1856, upon such conditions as may be best calculated to secure the regular liquidation of the principal and interest of the debt. Mr. Henley moved an amendment reducing the sum propo3ed to 320,0001., bat was left in a minority of one. I NETLEY HosPITAL.-Returns respecting this hospital have been published on the motion of Sir D. J. RI'orreys, M.P. They give an account of the preparation i ai,d approval of the plans of the hospital, and refer to the I oljections of certain memorialists of the Middlesex Hospital, insisting on the principle of making the wards open itotheexternalaironat least two sides, and having windows opposite to each other, &c. The site of the hospital was pointed out originallv by Sir James Clark, 21.D., reported on by Captain Laffan, RE., and finally selected by Lord Panmure after asearching investigation into all the details of the question. The objections of the inemorialists of the Middlesex Hospital were referred by Lord Panmure to a medical committeo of two gentlemen, in conjunction with Captain Laffan and Colonel P. O'Brien, ana this committee were unanimously of opinion that a few modifications in the arrangements of the Netley Hospital (detailed in the report) were all that was required to render the building well adapted to the purposes of a military, hospitaL

LO2fDON, TUESDAY, JULY21, 1S57. In the Eouse of Lords, last night, The Thames Conservancy BiU was read a second time on the motion of Lord ST. LEONAUD'S. The Duke of N EWCASTLE opposed the measure, and moved that it be read, a second time that day three months. On this motion the House divided, when the numbers were- For the Bill... ... ... ... ... 44 Against it ... ... ... ... ... Mlajbrlty in favour of the second reading-39 The 3Iersey Conservancy Bill was also read a second time, after considerable discussion, in which the Dake of NEWCASTLE, LordDERaY, Lord RAvENs. wo-rT, Lord WENSLEYDALE, and the Mlarquis of CLA1NRICARDE toolk part. Several other Bills were forwarded a stage, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, Sir J. PAKThGTOx reported from the Falkirk District of Bnurghs Election Comnmittee that ir. JAmES MERRY was not duly elected, and that the last was a void election. In reply to an inquiry by Mir. ROEnuCm, Ir. V. SnirTn stated that no iuformation had been received by the Governmeut of any disaffection among the native troops at Bombay, and that his impression from the last accounts wvas that none whatever bad made its appearance in either the Bombay or the Madras arnmy. Tho CBANCELLOR of the Exo'IIQUEn, in reply to Mr. BArXTW, stated that it wa" not hs intention to persevere in carrying on the Savings-banks Bill thia sewion, a-nd he subsequently withdrew the 1ilL On the report of the Committee of Supply, Mr. BENTIcWK, agreeably to notice, called. tten. i'ion to the state of the naval and miLtaeZ. dafenoeu
An in.uniry as to the defence of the country is lantamouat to a question of Ministerial confidence. It brings up the causes which have trenched on the meaus ofl defence; it challenges the Governnent undler which our forces have been suddenly called elsewhere; it impugns the prevision on which we lhave to depend for safety at home. No doubt, too, such an inquiry derives a colour fromn recent experience. Within two or three years we have had war either with or within nearly the whole of Asia ; and, much to our surprise, wet have been committed to hostile operations in Persia, China, and India, in each case by a sort of f;-tality, which public opinion had no share in producing. Why, then, not at home? Why .fhould we not find ourselves saddenly exchanging threats and blows with one or more of our immediate neighbours on this continent 7 So M1r. 3BEnxImmI- observes, with safe plausibility, that it is impossible that he or any one could nay what might occur in the next few weeks. Well, what might occur? There is the old terror of invasion, that " wolf " that has been so often cried that we should not even believe it if it actually came. There is the possibility of some sudden outrage of the strong upon the weak that would compel us either to interfere vwith energy or look on with humiliation. Suppose an occupation of Switzerland, a partition of Italy, an invasion of the Spanish Peninsula, or some other old or new crime. In any such contingency Mr. BEXTINCe or Lord A. V. TEMPnEsT would get up and remind the House, with all the diguity of neglected augurs, that they had pointed to exactly such a state of things, and asked whether England was prepared for it. At the close of the last war our army, says the latter, was 50,000 men under the estimates voted by Parliament, and after an interval of reduction we have sent, or are sending, 25,000 to India. WVhat are we doing, these wakeful patriots ask, to fill up the deficiency? Are we inercasing the regular army ? Are we calling out the MIilitia ? These are the questions asked now-a-days. A few years ago it was all fortificationis, coast batteries, Channel fleets, " harboars " of refuge," and defences in iron, wood, and stone. At leDg,th man has his value, and the gentlemen of the Opposition ask, to the disgust of the hon., though not yet noble member for Lambeth, whether we have soldiers enough for the defence of the country. At the risk of a tremendous confutation, with the bare possibility that in the last hour of the British Empire, amid shouts and explosions, w-e may hear the voice of Lord A. V. TElPEST exclaiming, "Didn't I tell you so ?" we must express considerable confidence in the people and resources of England. This is a question of men, and England, felix j1vole Wirurn, will never lack this first condition of safety. It is true that in no other country is there so great a disparity of the sexes. None sends so many colonists, emigrants, sailors, and soldiers all over the globe. It is also true that in no otlher country is the price of a man so higb, or are there so many occupations to divert the more adventurous from the Army and Navy. Yet, wve are ready to maintain that all this shows rather the prolific exuberance of the nation than its danger of exhaustion. If Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen start up in myriads year by year to follow one another all over the globe,-if no dangers, no hardships, no separations-nothing whatever can prevent them from undertaking the longest voyages, plunging intothe deepest continents, and courting the greatest perils in the quest of a livelihood, a position, or barren fame, then it follows there will never be a want of men to defend their country or tovindicate its honour. If too, our grown up men are absent, nature is ever supplying their place with a new generation in no way inferior to the last. It is from the age of eighteen to twentyfive that the ranks of the army are chiefly supplied, and withlini these years the number is always rising up to the mark. Our youth are brought up with the iclea of seelking their fortunes anywhere that duty or opportunity may lead them. They are not riveted to decaying patrimonies or wedded to servile crafts ; they trust to their strong arms and ready wits. It is often, indeed, said that we are not a military nation, and that our army is the smallest in the world, considering our population. But there is an important circumstance lost sight of in these remarks. Our army is the largest body of volunteers in the world. Neither Russia, France, nor Austria can show so many men who have spontaneously embraced the profession of arms. So sure and so abundant has been this great defence, that hitherto it has hardly been thought necessary even to cherish or elicit it. We have done more to repel men from the naval and military service than to invite them. In many ways it would be possible at once to render the services more attractive to the very class of men who would best answer our purpose. If we allude to them, it is not to raise any present question, but merely to point out for the benefit of the timorous how little we need fear for the supply of soldiers and sailors. An addition of 101. a-year to the pay of the soldier, or of equivalent advantages, wvould raise from the people any number of soldiers we could possibly want, at an expense inconsiderable, compared vith the usual expenditure of our wars. The promotion of the most deserving soldiers from the ranks would vastly raise the dignity and popularity of the service with the working classes. These measures may or may not be advisable under ordinary circumstances, but we have them in reserve, and, should the emergeney require it, we have no doubt that England iwould soon double her Army and Navy by thlse simple means. And she could do so without serious injury to that stock of human labour by which our fields are cultivated, our houses built, our mines worked, and the manifold operations of industry carTied on. It is observable how very many men can always be obtained for any work in this country, however laborious or severe. For a railway, a buildinig, or any other -work, particularly one that must be continued under all weathers, there are thousands of applications, and a large proportion from mere youths. Only turn the scale a little more in favour of the Arrmy and they will be found their country's defenders. Never fear, then, for the defence of the country so long as the people themselves remain what they are.
Towards the close of the Russian War it was dlificult to realize the apathy of 1854. That a few tlhousaiid men should have been sent out as if fur a demonstration, when the whole force of a Military Emnpire -was being gathered for the conflict agaiust them, seemed too absurd to have taken place only a few months before. An age seemed to have divided the gigantic efforts of one year r-rom the negligence and security of the last. But the thing that has been shall be. Who shall say wlhether, before we are much older, we shall not be looking back with wonder at the coolness and con6idence with which the nation received the news of the great Indian Mutiny of 1857? The last news from India was, indeed, sufficient to induce activity, if not alarm. In the opinion of some the erisis was past, and with the desertion of the high caste Hindoos the evil would come to an end. This is, indeed, probably the true state of things, and we sincerely hope to hear that the exertions of the local Government have been attended with success. But it is evident that everything depends on the gaining of a speedy victory. The news of the defeat of the Rebels before Delhi will, no doubt, have had a wholesome effect ; but the capture of Delhi itself is necessary to stril;e fear into the hesitating Regiments which now waver in their allegiance. When the last mail left it was the Bengal Army alone which lhad thought of revolt or desertion; but even then it was feared that the other Presidencies might take the infection. Men of the highest authority in Bombay and Mladras considered that if Delhi were not taken in a fewc days the effect on the Armies of the minor Presidencies would be most unfortunate. Nowr, both of these have sent almost all their European troops to Bengal. In Bombay, it is said, there remains but one European Regiment. All these millions of natives, headed by an immense army of Sepoys, have to be kept in order by a few hundred Englishmen. What may be the result ? What may be the news received by the next mail? If it prove that the Bombay and Madras Armieg hlavye followed the example of revolt, and that throughout India the British authorities only hold the ground their troops are encamped upon, what right has the nation to be surprised? While Parliament is hurrying through the last Bills of the Session and the world is hastening to escape from the heat of London the news may alTive that the conquest of India has to be begun again. In such a case as this we may fairly ask what are the means at the disposal of Government ? It appears that some 20,000 troops may be sent out to India, to arrive a little on this side of Christmas, and to march up the country in time for a spring campaign. What may happen in the meantime the world may imagine. We will not talk of the loss of Empire, because the power of this country to reconquer any tract from Asiatic soldiery is incontestable ; but the waste of life, the waste of money, the loss of character, and the burden of vigilance and preparation imposed for the future, may be matters of the most serious import. When a plain man reads this Indian newvs, and is told of the Government intention to send out troops, his first idea is that they will be sent out in the swiftest vessels which modern science has constructed. What is the gain by all this boasted progress if the first naval Powver in the world cannot make use of new inventions to save 'its most valued dependency ? Screw transports, screw line-of-battle Bsips, frigates of every size and construction remain from the last war, and it certainly seems but iiatural that these should in some -way be brought into requisition. But a man reasoning in this manner must be content to be told he is in the wrong. Lords of the Admiralty and professional men will inform him that the British Navy is unable to transport any troops to Asia. At this time the Naval Estimates are upwards of 8,000,0001. yearly. Britannia then rules the waves-or at least pays liberally for ruling them. But the British Navy is unable to furnish any aid in this emergency. Its duty and glory are to wait for invisible fleets outside impregnable harbours, to wander all over the ocean wherever the Admiralty choose to establish a " station," and to be always ready for immediate action in a period of profound pence. But to aid necessary operations by the transport of land forces does not come up to the high ideal of its duties. Thus, though we are spending yearly enormous sums on ships and steam engines, though only a few months have elapsed since the fleet for the attack on Cronstadt was declared to be ready, yet we are assured by Sir C. WOOD that there is not a ship to send out to India. Another nation has managed to convey troops by thousands in ships of war, and, indeed, always uses them for transport; but the example is unworthy of imitation. The Regiments ordered to India must embark in the regular East Indiamen, to bowl along the " trades" and lie becalmed on the Line, as their predecessors did who went out to fight TIpPoo SAID or the Mahrattas. All this time Lord LyoNs, with the Mediterranean squadron, is making a tour of visits to the various ports of Southern Europe. The Royal Albert seems destined rather to attract pleasureseeking friends than to execute vengeance upon enemies. But this immense first-rate has four capacious companions steaming listlessly from one harbour to another, while merchant vessels are being taken up to convey troops to the seat of war. At the same time Malta, Gibraltar, and Corfu are crowded with troops, part of which might well be utilized at this crisis. It certainly seems better that the Mediterranean garrisons and the Mediterranean squadron should be temporarily reduced, than that the most important province of the Empire should be left in danger. This is, indeed, no time for etiquette and routine. A danger is present as great as that which threatenea the country in 1854. The conclusion of that lamentable affair, the escape from official censure of the principal delinquents, and the distraction of public attention by the sudden increase of trade and industry, have restored the ruling class to all the confidence of the old times. The country is threatened with a struggle which may be long, and must be most expensive and exhausting. A speedy suppression of the Revolt, supposing it to have spread, can only be obtained by employing all the resources of national courage, wealth, and science. Yet in this age of inventions we find ourselves about to carry on a great war without the use of steam transport, without the electric telegraph, and with bodies of Europeans as small as fought under CLivz a hundred years ago. If our Army is to be of any use, and the Empire saved from new calamities and a fresh burden of debt, the troops must be despatched as soon as possible, and by vessels which will carry them with the greatest attainable speed.
Why this idle waste of human life in Italy? Why have these fresh holocausts been offered up on the shline of the Liberty which conspires, of the Liberty which disdains all recourse to the ordinary methods by which empire is won, is retained, or is lost ? The result of the attack upon an outlying fortification at Genoa, and the abominable murder of the poor sergeant who wa3 dozing at his post, are now matter of history, and of vcry pitiful history. Justice w ill no doubt be done amid the general applause upon all persons concerned in these atrocities-that is, upon all who can be secured, for the real autlhors of the design, according to their wont, have taken wise precautions for their owvn safety. The intelligence wlich reached us at the end of last week recounted the fate of those misguided men who, having sailed from Genoa in the steamer Cagliari, had subsequently seized the ship, and steered for the coast of Calabria. There seems to be some strange attraction in this portion of thewestern seaboard of Italy, which acts upon the imagination of desperate conspirators as a lighted taper allures the dazzled moth to its destruction. The Genoese conspirators landed in the Gulf of Policastro. A little to the southward a bend in the coast makes the Bay of Euphemia, and here lies the 'village of Pizzo, where JOACHIM MIuRAT, with a few companions, threw himself ashore just after the downfall of NAroLEox and met his fate. It seems that the party which had left Genoa in the Cagliari landed at a place called Sapri, a village; with ominous antecedents. Here lives a priest, who is said to have murdered a Deputy in 1848, and, having cut off his head, carried the bloody offering up to 1 aples as an acceptable gift. Here, we say, the adventurers landed on a Sunday morning, and, if our intelligence be correct, they were but ill received. They appear to have been between 400 and 500 strong, as the leaders had induced some 400 of the prisoners and of the soldiers in exile or on guard at the Island of Ponza, off Terracina, to join them. So they marched into the interior, or at least to some little distance from the coast, and were compelled to fight their way as they went from the Sunday till the Wednesday morning. On that day they seem to have fought a regular battle, and there was much slaughter. The grand result was, that the shattered remains of the Filibustering force which had landed at Sapri was dispersed among the mountains, and, if we read the intelligence aright, some had succeeded in regaining the shelter of the steamer. This point,, however, is not very important, for the Cw,4i,YWw.aa captured off Cap-- puher return trip by the NeapoZtau cruise. All persons on board of her were of course mac pnsouers. Thae, as we are informed, amnounted to 1, wrhereof 30 belonged to the crew, and S1 were. rincipals or abettors in the outbreak. Such was the termination of this movement-insurr'etion i, cannot be calledas far as the public are coxrcerne A very terrible conclusion remains for the wrtchecreatures who have fallen wvithin the power of no p a ss a conqueror as the Neapolitan KrNG, but who in 4,his instance may perhaps plead a somewhat truer pallick, tion for his enormities than usual. By the latest inteUligence from Paris, which reached London on Sunday night, we are informed that 150 of the, insurgents who landed at Sapri under the command of the unfortunate and reluctant PISAcARNE are lying in prison at Salerno. They are to be tried by the Grand Criminal Court of that city, and may, of course, be considered already as doomed men. Te Denmns are sung at Naples for the victory of Padula, and the grateful Monarch has returned than:ks to his loyal Calabrians for their attachment to his. person and tbeir devotion to his throne. Such is the natural fruit of these premature attempts. The AAzzxIiANs have played the Kn-G'S game for him with singular felicity. They have helped to rivet the chains of their unfortunate felow-countrymen -who are pining in protracted agony in the sweltering dungeons of their beloved Sovereign. They landed on a coast where their presence was neither expected nor desired. They were not in correspondence with persons of influence in the country; there had been nothing of arrangement, nothing of policy or design, about the enterprise from first to last. The adventurers appear to have acted on the supposition that a train was already laid which needed but a spark to fire it, and that their presence would supply the spark. They forgot that a population under such a tyranny as that which exists in Naples would receive the first tidings of an insurrection with incredulity and astonishunentthat the inteUigence for a whilewould be regarded as a snare laid by the Neapolitan police-that among them was no name which could inspire confidence or command respect-that even on the most favourable supposition there would be doubt and hesitation; and, supposing these feelings to endure but for a few hours, during those few hours the destruction of the expedition could be readily accomplished. The Neapolitans themselves are in no wise to blame tor the result. They are awaiting the hour of their deliverance in another fashion and at different hands, and, like rational men, they are content to wait til occasion serves. Throughout the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies there exists no wish fox liberty on the Azzmn-is. model. The K'Teapolitans seem to be perfectly aware that a few days indulgence in the wild Saturnalia of what is caUed F?reedom would be dearly expiated under the heel of a military dictatorship, or by a renewal of the monotonous tyranny under which they have too long been enthralled. It is, however, no dream to suppose that a time must at length arrive when they wil succeed in the object of their legitimate desires. A just administration of the laws and a moderate participation in public affairs are not extraordinary demands for a civilized people to iurge in the middle of the nineteenth century, and these demands they wil one day be able to enforce ; but the fanaticism of refugees or the frenzy of Filibusters will give them but scant help in the execution of their design. They must be patient, and they must wait. From themselves their deliverance must come, or it will not come at all. We will not venture to predict that their liberation will be the work of to-morrow or of the next day, but, if they be true to themselves, it will surely come. Meanwhile, let them summon resignation to their aid-not that resignation which results in apathy and despair, but the resignation of the strong man who bides his time.
A rumour of so strange a kind has got abroad, and has obtained so much credit in what are called " well-informed circles," that it would be highly satisfactory to meet it with an authoritative contradiction. This it is :-It is asserted that as soon as Parliament has risen, or at any rate during the recess, the recent Report of the Royal Commission upon the site of the National Gallery is to be treated as a nullity, and that the Collection is to be transferred to Kensington. In justification of this violent act, it will be pleaded that the decision received the signatures of only three of the Commissioners. These three, however, constituted a clear majority. Ifr. FORD had been selected as one of the original six, but from the first he had refused to act, consequently the number was reduced from six to five. Now, with regard to the five, Professor FAr.AnAY-a gentleman whose name we would mention with the most unfeigned respect-refused, if we are rightly informed, to affix his signature to the decision, or to any decision. He gave the Commission the benefit of his scientific knowledge, but would meddle no further with the matter. Four Commissioners remained. Of these three reported in favour of leaving the National Collection of Pictures where it is; one took another view. If this be not the decision of a majority we know not what is. We do not say we ourselves believe that the decision of the Commission will be disregarded, for the proceeding is so monstrous as to defy belief, but we are justified in the assertion that credit is attached to it by persons who have preeminently a right to be well informed upon such a subject. UInder these circumstances the course to be pursued is so obvious as scarcely to need suggestion from us. The Commons decided that an Address should be carried to the Throne, prayinig the QuFENN to appoint a Royal Commission for the purpose of investigating and deciding on certain points connected with the National Callection of Pictures. The Royal Commission was appointed, and has made its report. It is now proposed, we are told, to treat as a nullity the result of this investigation, which originated in the Commons' House; but that aEsembly wir have greatly degenerated froni its ancient spirit if it tolerates so grievous an indignity. The habit of treating Parliamentary decisions with indifference, not to say with contempt, should receive a timely check. There is yet ample time for putting such a question to the Treasury Bench as will considerably hamper the authors of this design, if, indeed, it be a reality.

I T4HE BENGAL MUTINIES. TO TRE EDITOR OF THE aDIES. Sir,-The public appears for a moment to have missed the point of the last Indian intelligence. One section, with Lord Elenborough at its head, is thoroughly and-let us speak it under our breath -not unpleasantly alarmed. It gloats over the details of insurrecetio it lingers pleasantly over the names of the regiments which have revolted, it considers the fidelity of the Irregulars doubtful, and 15szes on the crudest of stories in order to prove th9kt the populace sympathize with the insurgents. AnotMhar section, which includes many experienced Indiang, lotidkv proclaims that the affair is over. "It is, Sir," I am toldj-"' merAey a question of time. The scoundrels, Sir, have no leader. They will be crushed imimediately." But the real weak point, the black spot in the last despatches, seems in every quarter to escape comment. I believe, Sir, with you, that the movement will in the end consolidate the British power in India. I believe, too, that the Indians, absurdly as some of them express themselves, have arrived bv instinct at the truth. The recent intelligence is good, for this reason. The great danger, the one terrible calamity which was believed to menace the British empire in India, has arrived. It has been foreseen for years. The Friend of India for the past four years has urged incessantly that, if the Bengal army were not-reformed, "it would reform itself after a fashionithat would try the dourage rather of soldiers than of statesmen." It was considered that the misfortune, if it did come, would destroy us. BMen put it out of their calculations as they would a thunderbolt, an earthquake, or any other catastrophe too great for human effort to avert. The explosion at last has come. WVe coutld not have been less prepared. Yet the Government of India is not destroyed. The prestige of our rule has not departed. With Sepoys in arms to defend them, the prisoners let out of gaol beg to be re-imprisoned. Why?. They like imprisonment as little as we do, but they feel that the Government is irresistible. They might as well be released from the authority of Fate. In many places the Govermnent has already won the game. In many more it holds its own in spite of tenfold odds. In all it is clear that its victory is ultimately as certain as the destruction of the mutineers. The Anglo-Saxon in India has faced the death grapple aud thrown his opponent. That is the reason why I, and hundreds more experienced than myself, pronounce the late bulletins full of hope. But there is one black spot. It is perfectly clear from every step taken by the Government on the spot that it has not risen to the height of circumstances-has not in the smallest degree appreciated the task before it. It has left Delhi still uncaptured. It is nonsense to talk about the delays of General Anson, officers' blunders, and all the usual excuses for inactivity. Everybody who knows India knows that if the Governor-General had sent to the general in command an order to attack, with supercession as the alternative, the order would have been obeyed. Everybody knows that two days before the mail left Calcutta Sir Henry Lawrence, a soldier by trai-ing, a conqueror by instinct, telegraphed to the Governor-General, beseeching him to act. Every hour he said was of importance. . Everybody is ready and everybody is dawdling. Last mail men waited for General Anson. Now they are waiting for a siege train-a siege train to take a city defended by a big garden wall, with its centre street wider than Regent-street, sncd its palace,-a city full of women. I do not blame Lord Canning. His rebuke of Mr. Colvin for his insane proclamation is of itself a proof that there is nerve at head-quarters. But he does not see that India was conquered by Danton's maxim, " Touj7ctrs l'audace," and must be saved by similar audacity. The same spirit was manifested in the appointment of Sir P. Grant. Everybody is loud on the wi,dom of that appointment. I say-and the papers will, I believe, establish the fact-that he was appointed solely because his appointment was in accordance with red tape. If the resolution to sign a bit of paper was so energetic, the man wanted was on the spot. Suppose etiquette had been brushed aside, as Lord Dalhousie would have brushed it aside, and Sir HIenry Lawrence appointed military dictator, the rebellion would not have endured 10 days. Yet he was known to be the one fit man. HIe was on the spot. He had queled Oude. But no; official routine must have its way, and a Commander-in-Chief is ordered from Madras. Even this, however, is a trifle. Every such blunder involves the mutiny of three regiments, but the great mistake may yet involve the loss of the whole empire. It is evident that the Indiau Government has not a single definite idea for the reconstruction of the army. The Bengal Line, mutinous or loyal, valuable or useless, filled with soldiers or cutthroats, is, was, and is to be. It is an institution. The privates of one regiment which did not revolt are made non-commissioned officers; the menvwhosurrenderedtraitors receive commissions; yet, if I do not underrate the brains of my countrymen, the Bengal Line is doomed. It will beeextingnisbed in two years, while the people at Government-house are discussing how its buttons shall be improved. Lord Canning evidentlyintends that the disarmed regiments shall be trusted again. lWhen " the affair has blown over" they are to be once more conciliated. I have not a doubt that if the qnestion is left in Calcutta hands there wiU be a vast quantity of writing, and then the " faithful Sepoy" will once again be lauded at great dinners at the London Tavern, and old privates wiU be made officers, aud caste " studiously respected," and regiments drained of their best men, and India once more denuded from motives of economy of itsEuropean bayonets. This is not a rhetorical possibility. It is a certainty, unless men in England act decidedly. Lord Canning is an able man. He is even an energetic man. He is certainly an upright man. But he is surrounded by men utterly unfit to regulate or even to devise the reorganization of a mighty armny. This is no time to mince matters. There aic five members of CounciL Of these, AIr. Grant, the ablest, probably never saw three regiments together; General Low, all his life an ambassador, is now totally worn out; General OuLtram, a Bombay oflicer, is notoriously without administrative capacity; Air. Peacock is a black-letter lawyer; and, lastly, Mr. Dormn is a man who only pretends to nnderstand finance-who is the author of all our recent financial blunders, and who is in every other department a worn-out man of less than average brains. Yet if any accident occurs to Lord Canning-if one of his fevers lays him up, or the cholera, now marching from lUmbalah, attacks him, Mir. Dorin becomes instantly CGovernor-General of India. Has the Home Government provided against that contingency? No -moment, perhaps, ever was so favourable for the total reconstruction of the military system of BengaL 30,000 men, a clear third of the army, are gone already. I look to at least 20,000 more following them. Let recruiting be but stopped for four years, and the Bengal army, now a source of incessant danger, will be for all purposes of rebellion extinct. Meanwhile, by the beginning of 1858 there will be a European force sufficient to hold the country under any emergency. The Sepoys beaten will be at least passive, and it-surely will not require four years to levy the 50,000 Irregulars required. At aU Qvents Captain Plattray got 2,000 in six weeks-men who would eat, not to say beat, any two regiments of the Line. There are officers now to command them, for the officers of the disbanded, mutinous, or revolted regiments can fill up any gaps made by selecting the efficient of the remainder. As for finances, that is after all a rule-of-three question. A European regiment, if I mistake not, costs double a regiment of Sepoys. An Irregular corps costs a third less. The cost of 90 Line regiments will, therefore, keep 30,000 Europeans and 40,0uO Irregulars. That force, in place of the present armny, would, I firmly believe, render an insurrection in India impossIble. I do uot say this is the only plan, though it is the one approved by the best authorities, and hinted at frequently by yourself. There mlay be a hundred other plans. lt, is the total absence 6f any plan at all whicl s.m i the intelligence from Calcutta. AIGLO-BENGALEB.

Insurrection, both native men snd officers, cot-mmisoned and non-commisioned, bearing unusual hardships and privations with admirable temper and loyalty, and so I felt it ray duty to record of then, in my farewell address to the army at large of January 3, 1 yst. "To what cause, to what fatality, this stran outbreak is owing-by what misunderstandinhi these miserable ien have been led into such a course of wild excess-I do not pretend to divine. appeitherwLl I discuss the question of aLdvsniement to the grade of native officers in the three presidencies-the merits ordeperits of this or tbhat system. "Meantime I am content to side in opinion on this matter witl the Duke of Wellington, and with Lords ehardinge and ough. aknd Sir Charles napier (see their evidence before the Lords' commityee of 185bm3), and it would appear with Lord Ellenborough, since his Lordship recordls such proof ofD urpassinrg erit faingunder his ownobservation among the native officers of tht several distinguished Bengal corps webrings tothbenotice of the house.

" My dear Sir William,- I as very sorry you should feel that any observations of mine in relation to the Lamentable occurrences in Bengal should in any way cast re9lectioA upon you, as having been recently in command of the Bengal army, and which I had not the slightest intention of doing. Nseither did I say that General Anson concurred in the viewItool- of the bad state of discpline of that army. All I did say in reference to Auson was the prevalent report, that ever since he had been in command he had represented the necessity of an increase to the European force, and of which no notice had been taken. I said nothing about his view of the discipline of the army, because I knew nothing of his opinions. Of Lord Hardinge and Sir Charles Napier I had more knowledge, and the unfavourable opinion which the latter entertained is recorded in the history of his life. Entertaining the worst opinion privately, Lord Hardinge never would express it publicly, trying thereby to bolster up a bad system, on the ground of the impolicy of making publi the slight thread by which we held our tenure of that empire. I do not pretend to interfere with any view you may entertain, no persor. being better able to come to a just conclusion than yourself. I formed my own from what I saw and what came directly under my own knowledge. Without co-operation from the Court of Directors and their cordial support I do not believe it was in your power or the Governor-General's combined to reform the bad system which prevails in the Bengal army in every detail. "Sir Charles Napier's expression in 1S49. when several regiments mnutinied, two of the number being those at Rawul Pindee under Sir Colin Campbell, and which in somo degree concerned me, that we were sitting on a mine which nobody could tell when it ntight explode, has only come too true.. " Sir Edward Paget's opinion, given 30 vears ago, bas only proved how true an estimate he formed of thE morale of the Bengal native army. It would require too much detail to enter into all the circumstances which have conduced to the formation of the opinion I entertain of the sastem followed and the discipline maintained in the Bengal native army, and even the Company's European force in that Presidency. " That opinion was formed before you came to India. and you may believe me that I am not singular in that opinion; but at the same time entirely repudiate all intention, and most distinctly all inclination, to cast anv reflections on you while administering a systembad in itself, and which you could only streggle by every means in your power to strengthen and uphold. "Believe me yours very sincerelv. "M IELVILE. "General Sir William Gomm, KC.B." " 10, Now-street, Spring-gardens, July 17. "My dear Lord Melville,-I am thasikiul to yon for your explanations in reply to my letter of the 15th, " Still I cannot consider myself relieved by the excuses wbich you furnish me from the imputation of complicity, at least, in a course of proceeding highly reprehensible to my mind, in one holding the chief hidian command through no inconsiderable term, if really indulged in, and my conscience repudiates it. .1 I really believed the Bengal native army deserving of the encomiums with which I took leave of it in my parting address of January 3, 1856 ; and the disastrous occurrences of the present hour in no u-ise lead me to the conclusion that I was then self-deceived, while positively no sharer in the policy of deceiving others. "The facts upon which you ground your sweeping condemnation of thle Bengal system are, indeed, wholly indeffnsible as individual traits. As a counterpoise, hear Lord Hardingo vouching in bis examination before the Lords' Conmrittee of 1852-3 for the enduring constancy manifested by the Bengal army in the mass, when confronted with the Sikhs at the same period, utnder severer temptation to revolt than the force of either of the other Presidencies was ever exposed to; and whether attributable to the muchabused influence of caste, pension in prospect, or whatever otber motive proper to Bengal, there stands the fact, lastingly to the credit of its native army, and requiring no deductionsin the report on the score of polcy to trim it for favourable acceptance with the world. " For all tbese reasons I am taking leave to place our correspondence before the public as it stands; it commits yotu in no wvay, beyond your already recorded opinions, while it may have the effect of relieving nie from a certain share of blamJe to hich I do not consider myself amenable, witl some minds.

:3ECOND EDITION. THB TIMES-OPFIOB, Tuesday Mornz,ng. EXPRESS I,ROIYI PARIS. The following is the letter of ou-r Paris correpondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m.:- The weather continues intensely hot. AUl whom aily occupation or some other necessity does not eep fast bound fly from the sultry sky of Paris to lie seaside or the shelter of the woods. Of those w ho remain many pass hours bathing in the Seine when they do not dive into the depths of their wine uevllars; I doubt whether there is one who does not envy the ducks and swans that pass the livelong sulumer day in the basins of the Tuileries, or the nymphs, naiads, and Tritons who look so cool under 'cite ceaseless shower baths of the fountains of the Place de la Concorde. One great consolation is, thlattheheatwhich oppresses us inthestreets of Pari3 tuatures the harveat and places the labour of the hushi.ndmaubeyond thereachof contingencies. If we can nust to the calculations or predictions of science, the period is arrived when, here at least, we shall be )leased with the more steady and regular tempera. ture for a long time to come. The popular astro- ,ower and natural philosopher, M. Babinet, of the Institute, gives us great comfort. He expresses his ..onviction that for many future years this country will enjoy a regular succession of seasons ;-.that sr,ring will no longer be a continuation, if not an gravation, of winter: and that summer will not i y mnore be cooler than autumn. M. Babinet ..ys :- "In the normal meteorological state of France and Europe the west wind, which is the counter-current of the t ado winds that constantly blow from the east under th, LLopits-the west wind, Isay,after havingtouched Franco and S;urope by the western shores, re-descends by Marseilles and Ihe Mediterranean, Constantinople and the Archipelago, Aistrakan and the Caspian Sea, in order to merge again into the areat Circuit of the general winds, and be thus carried ain into the equatorial current. Whenever these masses uf air, impregnated with humidity during their passage over the ocean, meet with an obstacle, such as a chain of tiountains, for example, they slide up the acclivity, and. W-hen they reaoh the crest, lindithemselves relieved from a portion of the column of air which pressed upon them. . bus, dilating by reason of their elasticity, they cause a co,nsiderable degree of cold, and a precipitation of humidity , the form of fogs, clouds, rain, or snow. A similar effect A cours whatever be the obstacle they find in their way. Now, this is what had gradually taken place before 1856. i:y some cause or other connected with the currents of the ahtmosphere the warm current from the west had annuaUy *-cended northward, so that, Instead of passing through Prance, it came from the Baltio and the north of Garit any, thus momentarily disturbing the ordinary law of the ,'uniperatures of Europe. But in 1856 a sudden change ocev.rred. The western current again passed, as before, hrough the contre of France. It met with an obstacle rn the air which had not yet found its usual outlet '4.wards the west and south. Hence a stoppage, a tising, a consequent dilation and faU of temperature, extraordinary rains aud inundations. But now that the natural state of things is restored, nothing ap, ears to prognosUcate the return of similar disasters. Were the western current found annually to move further LLorth we might again experience meteorological effects vimilar to those of 1856. Hence the regular seasons may be considered re-established in France for several years to come. The Important meteorological commnunications which the Imperial Observatory is daily establishing with the other ocuntries of Europe, and the introduction of apparatus for ,,easuring the velocity of the aerial currents and prevailing winds, will soon afford prognostics sufficiently oertain to onable an enlightened Government to provide in time against future evils." All this is very cheering. In the meantime commercial busineas in Paris shares the lassitude which this fiery July sun produces in the human frame. Now and then there is a little stir, a mockery of life, like the light and passing air which has hardiy force enough to stir the leaves of the trees on the Lioulevards at sunset. Last week a few orders from &outh America and Spain for house furniture, %tailied paper, and aricles de Paris caused a slight anovenient in these branches of trade. But it is the dead season for cottons and woollens (who can lhink of wool without a sense of suffocation ?) in Iaris and in the departments. The proprietors of faucy sheps beguile their idle hours in taking stock aDd( calculating their profits for the past season, and as they doze over their desks and counters dream of the return of the cool breezes and smart business of the coming September. A few purchasers have, it is true, made their appearance at Rouen, Mulhouse, Amiens, and St. Quentin, and fiirther orders are expected. At Roubaix and Tourcoing, where, no doubt, a fresher atmosphere prevails, the manufacturers have enjoyed a contiiiuous demand for the last two months, but those of Lyons and St. Etienne, having no orders to execute, are laying in their stock of Bilk for the next season. Tho price of the article is still high in the southern markets, and purchases have been made in Italy and in India. It was feared that the large amount of specie required for the purchases at this time of the year wotuld produce an effect on the cash in hand in I-he Bank of France, but it appears that the directors of that establishment, who must know their position, are by no means dissatisfied with the present state of affairs. The directors have not ceased since last month to purchase gold abroad notwith. litanding the increased demand from the southern branch banks and the extraordinary increase in the a&mount of commercial bills presented for discount. It is hoped they will be enabled to reduce the rate of discount. The operatives employed in factories in several of the departments are deserting their in-door occupatio)is for field work. This is usual at this season of the year, and the two months spent in getting in the harvest tend to relieve the manufacturers from a too great accumulation of merchandise. You will readily believe, from the state of the weather and the flourishing condition of the crops, that prices are rapidly declining in Paris and the provinces. The average price of wheat at present does not exceed 25f. the hectolitre. The old grain which the farmers were keeping in reserve is now coming to market in all directions, and at the moment when the new wheat is ready for use the markets are more abundantly sulpplied than might be expected, as the farmers are desirous of getting rid of their stock. The accounts from the southern deo partments, where the reaping is going on, are excellent. Advices from Cartel-Sarrasin, in the Tarn and Garonne, state that on the last market-day in that town a considerable amount of business was transacted, and the price of wheat varied from 22f. to 25f. the hectolitre, being a fall of from 3f. to 6f. since the last market. The crops continue to be got in under the most favourable circumstances, so far as the weather is concerned. The quality of the wheat is said to be superior to that of former years, and in quantity above a fair average crop. The maize, beans, and pota. toes are in the finest condition. In Brittany we are told that the yield is so plentiful that it will not be easy to procure hands to save the harvest. The price of bread has fallen 10 per cent. at Nantes. Flour of the best quality was quoted at the Lst Paris market at 64f. BOc. the sack of 157 ldo' grammes for immediate delivery; 63f. 60c. for the end of the month; and 62f. SOc. for August and September. The price of bread has not changed in Paris for the last 15 days of the month, notwith standing the fall in the price of wheat, but a great diminution in the price is expected on the 1st of August. The price of rye has fallen gradually to 21f., 19f., and 18f. the weight of 115 kilogrammes. Oats have better maintained their price. The FWar Department contracted on Wednesday last for 4,000 metrical quintals of oats, to be delivered in Paris at 23f. 93c. the 100 kilogrammes. The rape crop, abundant in many districts, good ia others, and inferior in some places-at Caen, for instaDce, is entirely finished. The quality is good. The manufacturers will commence the extraction of oil this week, and will be in full activity at the end of the month. This is from 15 days to three weeks earlier than last year. The farmers are highly satisfied with the produce, and eager to sell at existing prices. There remains still 20,000 casks of oil of last year's produce at Villette. It is generaUy believed that the price wil be lower next winter. The temperature con. tinues extremely favourable to the vintage. The grapes are increasing in size, and are three weeks iu advance of last year. Wines are felling in price but Slowly, and those only of inferior quality. Business is dull, the merchants waiting the result of the oidium, which is said to be making progress in some vineyards in the Bordelais and Languedoc. Under all circumstances it is expected that the v3utage will be abundant and the wine of excellent quality. Count Nesselrode, the veteran diplomatist, has arrived in Paris. This is the fist visit he paid France since the year 1815. The Courrier de Havre announces that the Emperor will embark there for Osborne. Lord Cowley has left Paris for Toulon. The lloniteur Alg-ien publishes the following despatch from Marshal Randon:- " FORT NAPOLEON, JurLr 15. "I have arrived this insbant at Fort Napoleon, with my staff. ''Affairs are completely settled. Tho divisions Renault and Yusuf are on their way to return to their cantonments." Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria, has recommended Brigadier-General Bombaki and Colonels Margadell and Nesmes Desmarets for promotion, on account of their gallant conduct in the late campaign in Kabylia. A mint is to be established at Algiers, which will be under the direction of the Minister of Finance, like that of Paris. The Minister of War has determined that the Zouaves of the Line, as well as those of the Imperial Guard, are henceforth to be armcd with rifles and sabre bayonets. This measure will increase the Light Infantry by 11 battalions of picked troops. The Emperor has decided that there shall be a gaUery as the Museum at Versailles dedicated to paintings representing battles in the Crimea, as there is for paintings representing events in Algeria.

The reform of the Constitution being voted, without any real discussion, the session closes today. It has been prolonged, far beyond expectation, by the exertions of the Goveruiment, which used every means to keep an absolute majority oF the Congress in Madrid until such time as the numerous important biUs it had introduced should have been hurried and pressed through the Ohambers. The session has lasted two months and a half-a little more than 50 days, Sundays and festivals being deducted. In this short time the Constitution of '45 has been reformed; a new and nmost draconian law on the press has been authorized, although not discussed; the frontier treaty with France has been ratified; a law of public instruction, placing this in the hands of the clergy, has been voted; also a law of criminal procedure, and one concerning roads, centralizing the direction of these in the hands of Government. A host of measures adopted by the Narvaez Cabinet previously to the elections, and some of which were of a scandalous and unconstitutional nature, have received the sanction and approval of these most pliant and servile Cortes. Among those measures may bo enumerated the budget of 1857, the heaviest ever known in Spain, amounting to 1,834,000,000, a levy of 50,000 men, the incorporation of the provincial militia with the army of the line, an enormous increase of the floating debt, the employment of 600,0001. in the purchase of corn for the relief of the poor during the late scarcity (which is strongly suspected of having given fine opportunities of profit to persons in high places), the re-imposition of pmertos and cowuino5 (gate-dues and a sort of excise tax, abolished in the time of the Progresistas), the notorious Mirds loan, and the suspension of the law of disamortization. Truly, a great number of most important measures, but let no one suppose that they have been voted by repreientatives of the people. It is well known how the Spanish elections of 1857 were conducted, and that the Deputies returned were chiefly Government nominees. Nevertheless, as is common in Spain, a party that was not Ministerial soon formed itself in the Congress. It was composed of various groups, which would have given their combined support to Bravo Murillo, had he chosen to oppose the Government. Instead of this, he thought proper to support it, for various reasons, which I have explained in former letters, but chiefly because it was doing the work of the reactionary party to which he belongs, and because the circumstances of the time were too critical and anfavourable for him to desire to take office. He has now left for France, and it is understood that he is on bad terms with the Palace, so that if the soi. disant Constitutional Ministry of Narvaez were to be exchanged for one more retrograde, it is probable Beltran de Lis would head the new one. That would be worse even than Bravo MuriUo. At present there are no signs of a Ministerial change, but a caprice of the Palace would suffice to bring one about. Narvaez and his colleagues, however, profess to consider themselves firm in their places, and I am aware of no grounds for saying that they are not so-as far as any Government can be said to be firm under a Sovereign whose sweetest smiles are often the forerunners of a fall. At present they certainly seem to have it all their own way. The law on the press has rid them of one cause of uneasiness. Since yesterday the papers may be said to be mute. Some of them do not give leading articles, and those that do give them maintain the greatest reserve, and are accordingly perfectly tame and uninteresting. While silence is thus imposed on the only organs of public opinion, measures of intimidation are vigorously pursued both in Madrid and in the provinces. The alarm excited by the numerous arrests and nocturnal domiciliary visits that have recently been made here, and the additional attention drawn to the subject by the bold persistence of Senor Gonzales de la Vega, in catechizing the Government on the subject, have induced Ministers to put forward, through its docile organs in the prei s, statement3 of a pacifying nature. A few pe !ne have been released-among others, Clob Riego, who, however, is a man of no capacity or political importance, and who wid never have been i heard of did not hi name happen to be Riego. He is ordered to take up his abode at 1 iAranda del Duero, residence only one degree preferable to a pris Last night's Epoca says that since the nigt,Ã¯Â¿Â½ the 13th inst. no arrests or domiciliary v.its have been made, no strings of prisoners sen!96 Leganes. The Disousiew asserts exactly the contrary, and I can in part confirm its assertion. I positively know that yesterday morning, between 1 1 and 3 o'clock a.m., houses respectably inhabited were entered by the police, and searched from top to bottom. The inmates were questioned and made to show their papers. Search was made under beds, and even in boxes and women's trunks, ap. parently for arms. Of one house, all the inhabitants -afterbeing roused up ingreat terror at half-past I in the morning by a commissary of police, accompanied byfpolice agents and civil guards-were kept on foot for an hour and a half while this vexatious and tyran - nicalinvestigation proceeded. Itwas entirelywithout result; not a weapon was found nor the slightest grounds upon which to arrest any one. This sort of thing has gone on niglhtly for some time past. The Coare.spondencia Autografa says that the Civil Governor of Madrid " has repaired the injustice which, by excess of zeal or mistake," some of his subordinates have committed. This means that some of the prisoners have been set at liberty, but no compensation has been made to them for having been unjustly confined or dragged away like felons to Leganes, and no public investigation has cleared their character from the slur thus cast upon it. Fortunately for them, persecution by such a Government as this Is rather an honour than a dis,race. While thi, tyranny and cruelty are exercised in Madrid, where there has not been the shadow of an attempt at disturbance, and where, as Narvaez himself declared some days ago in the Cortes, there has not been the least grounds to fear one, in the south a sort of Bloody Asize is being held. Assize is not quite the right word; a military commission, or drumhead court-martial, and a strong firing party, seem the order of the day in Andaauaia. I collect the following details from different letters and papers:-On the Uth, at half-past 6 o'clock p.m., 24 prisoners belonging to the revolutionary band which went out from Seville, were shot in that city. Among them were their chiefs Caro and Lallave. The latter was a man of 79 years of age. Caro made important disclosures, and declared he had been completely deceived by the real promoters of the rebellion, who said that it was general throughout Spain. Strings of 15 or 20 prisoners are daily brought into Seville. and among them are some women. It appears that many of the insurgents have succeeded in escaping to Gibraltar. Ar. rests continue to be made in consequence of the revelations of prisoners. In the affair at Benaojan the rebels, finding themselves attacked in front aud flank, broke, and were pursued and sabred by the cavalry. Thirty-seven corpses remained on the field. Another account says that Lallave was no: shot at Seville, but was sent off to Utrera, wher 3 he kept a shop, to be executed there, with 20 others. A letter from Seville says that when Caro and the 24 others were shot some of the soldiers took bad aim, and two or three bystanders were mortally wounded. From Rondo they write that on the afternoon of the 6th the civil guard brought in two brothers, aged respectively 14 and 15 years, who were thrown into prison, where already had been for two months confined their father, uncle, ani grandfather, all of the name of Castro, in consequence of certain inscriptions that had been chalked up in a village, nobodyknew by whom. Withthe two captive lads came another brother, seven years old, who went to the jail and Implored to be admitted, since it was the residence of all his unhappy family. The Discusion says-" 24 men were shob on the 11th, 45 were to be shot on the 12th, and it is feared that the same fate is reserved for 65 others now in the prisons of SeviUe." General Narvaez has got his opportunity at last, and is regaining his reputation. No wonder that he is able to declare to the Chambers that "order reigns in Warsaw." The Government says that it has proofs that the late insurrection in the south was planned a long time back-as far back as the latter days of Espartero's Ministry; and that its chiefs had reckoned on having 12,000 men in arms in Andalusia alone, bu that somehow, when the time came, arms were wanting, and that this was the cause of the rebellion miscarrying so miserably. The declaration made the other day by Gonzales Bravo in the Cortes, in reply to Canza Argaelles, who in one of the Beltran de Lis or Absolutist party, is looked upen as important by some persons here. It was to the effect, you wiU remember, that IsabeUa II. is essentially a constitutional Sovereign,that her right rests upon the constitution, and is inseparable from it. It was, perhaps, the most decided demonstration the Ministerial party has made this session against the partisans of Isabella absolute. As a party question it was certainly an important declaration, and had it been made earlier in the session it might possibly have weakened the Governmentmajorities,which have been swollen by the Isabellina Absolutists. But, as far as the country is concerned, the importance is much less. Nothing can be practically more despotic than the rule which now presses upon Spain. The shadow, the phantom, the mockery of Cortes is there, but that such an Assembly affords no guarantee for the liberties of the nation, or for the inviolability of the Constitation, has been proved over and over again during the present session. Senor Bravo's object is perfectly transparent. He sees that the reaction is going further than he desires or than is safe for himself and his party; he discerns an Absolutist Government looming at no great distance, and behind it he sees revolution, not feeble and undecided, relenting and temporizing, as she hitherto has shown herself in Spain, but desperate and bloody, with torch and sabre in hand. He trembles at the sight, and strives to make a stand upon the remnant of those constitutional guarantees he has assisted in destroying and been forward iu trampling on. Methinks it is too late, and so think thousands of Spaniards, who foresee and deplore beforehand the miseries in store for their unfortunate country. The Duke of Rivas, the new Ambassador to the Court of France, has received his credentials, and is expected to leave Madrid very soon for Paris. The funds have faUen greatly these last few days. The Three per Cents. stood at 38.50; ditto, Deferred, 25.70 (no transactions). PORTUGAL. The steamer Minho has arrived at Liverpool, with Lisbon dates of the 14th init. The only foreign vessel of war in the Tagus was the French steamer L% Bourdonnaye, on her way to the West Indies. The Royal Mail Company's steamship Tamar arrived at Lisbon on the morning of the 13th, landed mails, and proceeded on to Rio de Janeiro on the afternoon of the same day. The stock market was dull and prices were looking down, but with no decided alteration. They were quoted as follows:-Three per Cent. Registered, 47 to 47k; Coupons, 46C to 1; Deferred, 28& to 29; Bank of Portugal Shares, 8 to 9 per cent. premium. The exchange on London was still looking up, and some transactions had been effected at 54i for three months' date. The Cortes were closed on the 11th inst. by His Majesty Pedro V. After complying with the usual formalities, His Majesty read his speech, in which he thanked the members for their zeal and attention, as also for putting at the disposal of the Government the means for carrying out measures of public utility, and specified as thej most important, and as exercising the most direct influence in developing public prosperity, the project for uniting Oporto 'with Lisbon by means of railway communication. He lamented that shortness of time prevented their adopting any plan of public instruction, thanked them for the liberal allowance granted to his futura Queen, and concluded by expressing his satisfaction at the amicable relations which existed with the Allied Powers, the atate of internal peace of the country, and the prospect of a better harvest for the present year. ITALY. The legislative xession of the Piedmontese Cham_ bers was closed on the 16th. On this subject the Piedmntese Gazette of the 17th says:- "The leglslative Session, opened on the 27th of January and closed yesterday, leaves an agreeable and lasting im. pression on account of the importance of the questions treated, the utility of the measures adopted, and the interest of the discussions. This session affords a briliant proof of the progress made by our country in a short space of time in the practice of representative institutions. The laws for the fortifications of Alessandria, the transfer of the naval arsenal to La Spezia, and the now law on military conscription have provided for the organization of the national forces and defences. The law which abolishe5 the usury laws is a new stop in economical science. The laws on publc instruction, on ground rents, on the reform of prisons, and many others have consecrated irnportant improvements in public administratration. We will conclude with mentioning the law for the Iggurian railroad, extending from the frontier line of the Var to that of Modena, and the law for the perforation of Mount Cenis, a colossal project, which, as an English paper has happily expressed it, is worthy of ancient Rome and modern England." The following private telegraphic despatch has been received;- " MAPRSEILLES, JULY 19. "Accounts from Naples of the 16th announce that the insurgents who were mado prisoners in the late affair will not be tried by the Military Court, but by the Royal Court of Salerno. This more lenient measure has, it is said, been decided on because a part of the prisoners of Pona were led into the movement by threats, and were compeled to fight. Several who refused to march were shot by the order of Pisacane. The second leader in the revolt, Baron Nico. ters, an ex-fnnctionary, who took part in the insurrection of 1848, and was then banished, is among the wounded prisoners.

PoISOax-Co BY PDRrssic ACID.-On Saturday evening Mr. W. Carter, coroner for East Surrey, instituted an inquiry at the Albany Arms Tavern, Albany-road, Camberwell, relative to the death of Mr. James Sebastian Yeates, aged 62 a stockbroker, residing in the Crescent, Albanyroad. Mr. George Edward Yeates, the deceased's son, on Thursday morning last found his father lying in bed dead. He then went for Mr. Gower, a surgeon, who attended. About 12 the same day witness again went to his father's room, and there perceived on the dressing-room table a small bottle, not labelled; bat there was a cork, which, however, did not quite fit. He took up the bottle, and found it smelt very strongly of almonds. When witness first entered the room in the morning there was no such smell pervading the room, and Mr. Gower, iie surgeon, did not notice the bottle. Mrs. Letitia Yeates, the wife of the deceased, who was dreadfully agitated, proved that she had never seen the bottle produced, and that when she went into the room after her son George arrived she did not smell anything peculiar. Mr. Thomas Griffith, surgeon of High-street, Peckham, said he found the deceased in bed dead. While in the room he noticed a phiai on the dressing table, which he took up, and at once detected a powerful smeli of prussic acid. He went to the body of Mr. Yeates, and, pressing on the chest, placed his nose to the mouth, but could not smell anything. He took possession of the phial, which contained about half an ounce. He had made a post mortees examination, and when he opened the body the smell of prussic acid was very powerful. He had not the slightest doubt that the deceased died from the effects of that poison. The witness added that he went downstairs, and, addressing one of Mr. Yeates's daughters, asked her if she could give the slightest clue to the cause of her father's death, and she said, "'ave you seen the bottle? " The whole of the family declared tat thoy had never seen the bottle containing the poison before it was found on the dressing-table. The coroner said the last statement made by Mr. Grifflth was most important,and he should notbe doing his duty if he allowed such a case to pass without the fillest investigation, as the circumstance of the bottle not being found in the morning, and no one detecting the smell of the poison, was most strange. He sbould therefore adjourn the case for a few days, to examine the young Lady who made thLe statement to Mr. GrOth relative to the bo.le containipg the poison,
M ONj&Y-lMA.KB2TandC2ITYINTELLIGENCJg. M1onday Evendng. What would be given in money at this moment for the power of bringing India, by an effort of will, ],000miles nearer to us? The most sangaine would be glad to commute the expenditure that must be consequent on what is now going on for ten millions sterling, and double that sum would be thought a small outlay for the assurance of future quiiet. But the end must be accomplished by large votes for the military and naval services If it can be promoted by commercial means, at a cost not exceeding three months' outlay in other ways, or even at no cost at all, indifference will have to be overcome at every step. Twenty years ago the neglect of the Euphrates route to India was cited among the marvels of British apathy. From the first explorations of General Chesney, down to the present day, every man of action has wondered why every other man of action has not bestirred himself in the affair, until at last each has come to believe there must be some difliculty in it known to everybody else, but which he himself never happens to have heard of. Meanwhile Turkey, through whose dominion the route runs, has become Europeanized, free trade has created an illimitable demand for the natural productions of the lands by which it would be bordered, and the introduction of rail, tram, and plank roads, and steam navigation in every form, down to boats capabloe of carrying any number of passengers, and drawing only 12 or 18 inches e4 water, have supplied every appliance to simplify the work. These changes, however, have brought us no nearer to its execution. The grand inducements are political, but it can be properly carried out only by a commercial organization; and, as the Government cannot find any analogous case to support such a combination, and never enter into works of this kind themselves, it must apparently remain for ever at a dead lock. Money may be advanced to a country like Greeca without the prospect of a shilling ever coming back. more than a million may be paid to facilitate our traffic through the Danish Sound; and liabilities on political loans may be undertaken for Turkey and Sardinia. The question of bringing India within 14 days' reach, instead of 28, is not to be so rashly entered upon. Each inhabitant, not only of the unitedkingdom, but of everyBritish colony throughout the world, is eager to protest that it ought forthwith to be'accomplished, that it would be cheap at any cost, and that, as far as he individually is concerned, he would readily contribute as much as 'would suffice, supposing all to do likewise, to build the route three times over. But all this good-will is nothing unless it can be concentrated, and it cannot be concentrated, except by the Government; and, as it has not been the habit of the Government to move in such matters so as to furnish the requisite precedent, and there is a general impression on the part of all official people that England must never do anything she has not done before, the difficulty may, perhaps, be insuperable. A letter in The Times of Saturday described exactly how the matter stands. General Chesney and Sir John MNeill have made the requisite surveys, and the Turkish Government have granted a guarantee of 6 per cent. upon the proposed amount of capitaL Turkish Six per Cents., however, even with the security of the Egyptian tribute, are only at 95, and consequently this assistance will not suffice. Neither will any assurance avail with regard to the prospects of traffic. All the British residents in Syria-Consuls, merchauts, and others-have reiterated for years past that the results of railways in that region, where unexampled capacities of production are coupled with ruinous costs of transit, would be beyond anything yet witnessed; but, after the experience of 1847, if 50 per cent. per annum could be demonstrated in this way, the public would have nothing to do with it. Let them have a guarantee-no matter if it be from t,be smallest European State, or only from the local authorities of some unheard-of town in the United States or Canada, and they are ready with their cash to any amount, but an assemblage of all the wisest men of the earth could not persuade them to return to their old ways of self-reliance. Under these circumstances, therefore, even if it were simply a commercial question, there would be no hope of movement, and of course, as it happens that whatever gain might result in this respect would be exceeded tenfold in a political sense, it is natural that capitalists should say " If the Goverment want all the advantages, they shall at least give us help, even although it be but nominal. If they think the thing will pay commercially, they can have no reason to refuse; and if they doubt that result, it is the height of meanness to urge us Oa to the work which they know will, under any circumstances, be Invaluable to them, whatever may be its returns to us. Precedent may possibly be found for such a course, but ff so a more honest one had better be established." The help demanded from the Government is simply a small protection against contingencies, such as are wholly beyond the range of probability. " We ask," say the promoters, " that the British Government, in case of two simultaneous circumstances-namely, the line failing to pay any interest, and Turkey repud-- ating her guarantee-shall undertake to grant us 5 per cent. for 25 years, or 49 for 50 years. No speculative plunder can be made out of this, since the terms are barely up to the average value of money, and the answer that may be given will now determine whether the routeais to be eutertained, or, as far as England is concerned, flinally abandoned." The first outlay to connect the Mediterranean with the Euphrates is stated at 1,400,0001. Tae entire line to Bussorah, on the Persian Gulf, would involve an addition of 8,000,0001. But the frst section, by opening up a practicable, although temporary river transit, would test the whole matter. On this the liability of the British Government, supposing Turkey to break faith, and a line which establishes a connexion between the Mediterranean and one of the richest cities of the East-Aleppo-should be found not to yield more than 2 or 3 per cent., would be from 28,0001. to 42,0001. for 25 years, or aboul equal per annum to the cost of a aingle trip of three or four of the steam-transports now about to start, for Calcutta. Lord Palmerston is represented to be thoroughly anxious for the enterprise, but according to the letter published on Saturday it looks as if there were some fear that the idea of establiRhing a new precedent may prove a lion even in his way. As we have no other empire embracing a population of 200,000 with whora we can shorten communicmt'on by 1,000 miles, it is difficult to see how the precedent is likely to be revived, and, even if this were not the case, it could not, as has been truly observed, prove otherwise than .useful, since, supposing it to be succesful, the sooner it could be followed the better, while in the other case there would be an unanswerable ground for refusing its repetition. At all events, if the Euphrates route is to be abandoned the opposition to the Suez Canal should cease. It would be discreditable to England to insist that because she refuses to do anythingothernations shall likewise remain passive. The English funds opened firmly this morning at the improved quotations of Saturday, and subsequently experienced a further advance. Consols for money were first quoted 914 to 1, and tlhe final transactions were at 91g to 92 for money, and 92 to i for the 6th of August. The market was scarcely so strong at the close as it had been a a*ort time pre. vionsly, the price for August having at one time touched 92i, A repoi was cirvulatod dWing the day that accounts had been received from Russian sources of the Bombay army having risen in favour of the mutineers of Bengal, but the Government and the India-house were without a syllable of further intelligence, and, as some of the xpeculative Greek firma appeared to be anxious to make purchases, little doubt is entertained that the alarm was got up to suit the purposes of these persons. Looking at the suspense into which such a report must plunge those families who have relatives and friends at the scene of danger, to say nothing of the general anxiety of the country, steps should be- promptly taken in every case of this sort to trace it to its source, go that, supposing it to be a fabrication, its despicable authors should be held up to public odium. All perzons to whom the statement had been communicated would, of course, willingly assist in this object, and it seems unlikely, therefore, that th3 exposure woiuld be attended with much difficulty. Meanwhile, until an example shall have been made, each day between the fortnightly mails will witness rome attempt of the kind, especiplJy as great senitiveness has been created by the injudicious conrcead ment practised by the Government on the last occsion. In other respects there was nothing to act unfavourably upon the mnarket. The operations of the day were not numerous, but the public seemed disposed to effect purchases, and the growing abundance of money is beginning to create some symptoms of buoyancy, such as have not been witnessed for more than a year past. Loans were freely offered in the Stock-Exchange on Government secarities at 5 per cent., and for short periods lower rates were readily accepted. A heavy faU in the corn-market and a continuance of the recovery on the Paris Bourzo likewise tended to create confidence. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 2151; Roduced, 92 to i; Ner Three per Cents., 92k to ; India Stock, 216 to 218; India-bonds, 15s. to JOs. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the discount-market to-day there -was no alteration, the rates being a fraction below those of the Bank. In foreign securities the principal feature wais the continued speculation in Turkish, which experienced a dlight eaction. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were alsolargelydealt in, andclosedratberweaker. Jr. other decription-s little business was done,andpricea showed no mLaterialvariation.

On the Corn-Exchange this morning there was a fall of 5s., and if any very large sales had been pressed the market would have further given way. The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Boures this evening were . 7f 60c. for money and 67f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing another improvement of three-eighths per cent. Itis stated that the principal part of the 186,0001. brought from New York by the Persia and Fricsson on Saturday is on French account. The amount of silver to be despatched by the next overland mail, on the 4th of August, is expected to be large; and, as the 400,0001. which is looked for from Mexico will not reach London in time, supplies will have to be procured from the continent. Some persons anticipate that the drain to India will be greatly increased, owing to the diminutionin the demand for our manufactured goods that must be consequent upon the existing outbreak; but on the other hand, the payments of the Indian ioverament to this country for transport service and war material wi)l be extremely heavy. The reports of the trade of the manufaturing towns continue without any new feature. At Mancheeter the prices of goods still fail to keep pace with the upward movements of the Liverpool cottonmarket. Hence, although stocks are low, there is no inducement to an increase of production. The Birmingham iron, trade is well supported by orders from the 'United States and Canada. At Nottingham there has been a slight increase of demand both for lace and hosiery. The woollen districts have not been active, but the prospects of the harvest inspire great confidence. The Irish linen-markets are without alteration. Telegraphic advices from Spain to-day announce an extraordinary decline from the recent high prices of wheat. Liverpool letters state the suspension of Messrs. Henry Schwabe and Co, with liabilities for about 60,0001. A composition is said to be offered of 6s. Sd. in the poundL A meeting was held to-day of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation, which went into liquidation in March last on the discovery that more than its entire paid-up capital of 250,00U1. had been dissipated in loans to Colonel Waugh and other members of the Board, including Afr. Stephens, the managing director. Captain Beville presided on the present occasion, and a report was read showing a reduction since the 11th of April of the liabilities from 340,2401. to 282,7061., and of the assets from 334,0101. to 269,9961. The estimate of the loss to be sustained by the shareholders in addition to their entire capital has been raised from 6,3201. to 12,7101., owing to advices from India of the disastrous results of the exchange operations carried on by the directors in Londou' to supply themselves with funds. The resolution adopted at a former meeting, that the shareholders should give promissory notes for a sum equal to 250,000l. (being 501. on each 1001. share, in addition to the 501. already paid) to the Oriental Bank, by whom the wincrng-up is to be carried out, as a security against any deficiency in the assets, had been already acted upon to the extent of 206,1501., and two calls of 151. each have been made upon those shareholders who have refused to accede to this plan. During the discussion opinions were expressed that the career of the London and Eastern Bank has been marked by circumstances far worse than those of the Royal British, and that it is much to be regretted the fact of its being privately liquidated will prevent it from. undergoing a like judicial examination. In answer to questions from Mr. Guedella it was stated that not one of the open accounts of the directors has yet been adjusted. Annexed is an extract from the report:- t The managers of the bank in India have made over charge of tbe branches at Bombay and Calcutta to the agenta of the Oriental Bank, by whom the Indian affairs are being wound up as expcditiously as possible. It is due to the managers of theEe branches to state that the Indian busincss his bten conducted prudently and with due regard to the interests of tbe shareholders, the only operationas resulting in lo.S being those originated at the head-office. This loss has arihen chiefly from heavy drawings in London on the branches in Calcntta and Bombay, and consequent re-draughts between these branches and on England at disadvantageo-us exchange,, and by these operations the balance of 42,7001) claw appearing in the accounts as to be received from India will be reduced to less than 20 0001. In pursuance of the arrangementwith the Oriental i3AnK Uorporation pronuilsnrv notes of shareholders on account of unpaid capital for 206,1501. havo been handed to that corporation, who have also received in Calcutta calls or security for the payment of calls amounting to 1,3201. " A second call of 151. per share has been made payable on the lst of August, and steps will be taken to enforce this and the previous caa of 151. per share, payable on the 24th April ult., against those shareholders who have not given their promlissory notes for unpaid capital. The statement of accunmt now laid before the meeting embraces the result of the liquidation from the 11th of April, the date of the last account, to the 11th inst., and shows that the liabilities of the bank have been reduced from 340,240Q. to 282,706U In addition to the assets actually realized an ap. plied in reduction of liabilities as above considerable pro- gres has been miade in arranging and bringinginto-shape many outstandings of a complicated and doubtful chsarcter. When the last report was made the estimated deficiency wat 6,3201., and by the present statement the deficiency appears to be 12,7101. This arises, not from too high a valae havm_g been formerly ninade of the assets, but from lomon Indian exchbuge, as previ usly explained. " It is hoped the out-tarn of the general assefs wi fally bear out the prePent estimate, but the final result of the liquidatiou must entirely depend on the realwlmion of the securities held for Colonel Waugh's debt." At a meetihm of the Union Bank Oc Australia today, Mr. R. Campbell in the chair,, tEle report and accounts were unammimouisly adopted, and a dividend of 91. lOs. per ct-nt. for the half-ye.ar was declared, making, with the previous payment, a total distri- bution of 19i per cent. per annum ireo of Incometax. The chairman adverted to the large amount appearing intthe account for lucome-tsx-14,001., ancl observed that that item would be in future reduced to about 5,00Mi. He also stated that the new bank builaixga, required had been pro.

The report of the directors of this company states that the traffic receipts have bven 1,489,658H1., and the workin expenses 906,817fl., or 60 87 per cent., leaving a balance of 582,8411L. Deducting from tbi3 the interest on loans and Government duty on dividends, there renains a disposable balance of259,916fL., fromwhich has to be deducted 240,000d., the provisional dividend paidinJaBnary last, leavinga balance of lb,916til., which is too ssall for distribution. The number of train miles run during the past book-year amounted to 466,202 English. The working charges havo amounsed to 3s. 3d. per English mile. Of the above mileage 227,231 miles were perfornied during the summer half-year, at a cost of 378,84111., or 2s. 9d. per train mile, while the remaining 238,971 miles were performed during the winter hael-year at a cost of 527.9761l, or 3s. 8d. per train per njile. The locomotive power has cost something more than 10^d. per English mile. The quantity of coke consumed by the engines has been at the rate of 341b. per mile. The working expenses of the summer halfyear amounted to about 45 per cent. on areceiptof843,14111 - whle in the winter half-year the proportion was about 8d per cent. on a receipt of 646,517d. Contrary to all expectation, after the junction with the Prussian lines was effected the expenses of the establishment swallowed up nearly the whole of the receipts. The increased expenditure was occasioned by the number of trains imposed by tho Governments, and, above all, by the requireament of night trains. The receip,ts fromu passengers dusring the winter months demonstrate most plainly that the accommodation afforded is not required. The directors have already acquainted Government that it will be impossible for the company to continue running night trains on such disadvantageous terms. The receipts for passengers, luggage, &c., on the old line between Amsterdam and Arnheim, 57 English miles, had increased from 619,1951a. in the book-year of 1851-52 to 874,866l. in the book-year of 1856-57. The receipts for passengers upon the new lines amounted to 257,752d1. in 185556, and to460,66911i in 1856-57, the first year being for the most parb receipts on the Rotterdam line only. The through goods traffic since the line was connected with German railways has not in any way responded to expectations, having since the opening up to the 30th of April last on.ly ,nroduced about 52i,70081. for goods, coals, &c.

THE CORN hA?DE. MARK-LANE. MONDAY AFl'VWR%P - OTflOn The arrivals of wheat, barley, and oata last week were good; of other grain short. The exports were only 200 quarters of maize, 4 quarters of beamns, 9 quarters of peas, and S sacks of flour. Of home-grown wheat the quantity was 6,278 quarters, of foreign 17,031, nearly 10,000 being fron, Dantb,jc. The aceuemulations of English last week, with the uvorning's arrivals from the near counties, made a fair shvw otn the Essex stands; bat the highly favourable weather produced a complete suspense in trade. Factors were willing so concede about 5s. beyond last HIonday's reduerion, hut usillers continued reserved, and the little buess done at the Kentish stands was at about that abatemenet. Holders of foreign were generally conttent to wait events, but to sell in retail it was necessary t.) take 2s to 3s. less money. Quotations have becoiiLe quite nominal. The receipts of English floun were 11,362 sack2; of foreign there were 2,760 sacks 978 barrels American vii4 Havre. Norfolks were reduced to 40s. per sack, and foreign samples were without inquiry. Of English barley there were only 114 quarters, of foreign 6,122 quarters. Good Saale quality anid s-veut parcels for distillation commanded about previous rates, but inferior grinding sorts were rather cheaper. SOIine new Kentish brought 44s. per quarter. Of oats the supply in all was 38,137 quarters, of which there were only 40 quarters Scotch, 217 quarters English, and 3,260 quarters from Ireland. Of the foreign supply 2,000 quarters were from Archangel, and 7,185 quarters from Riga. This good supply, with the fiue weather, reduced prices 6d. per quarter, and sales were slow. Of beans there were only 20 quarters from abroad, and 657 quarters English. Of peas only 15 quarters native and 817 foreign white. Though there was little business, prices were firm for both beans and peas. The receipts of linseed were 145 quarters, while the exports were 1,635 quarters. Prices both of seed aid cake were supported. In seeds very little was done. New rapeseed fell to 361. per last. Canary was difficult to quit. No change in other seeds.

APPEALS. HOUSE OF LORDS, MoNZDAY, JULY 20. THZ MAYOP, &C., OF BEVERLEY V. THE ATTOBREY~WN.rt r. This was an appeal from a decison of the Court of Chan. cory mn respect of an information filed by the Attorney. General against the Mayor, &c., of Beverley, in Yorkshire. It apeared that Robert Metcalf, by his wll dated the ot D October, 1652, bequeathed certain lauds and prenises then worth 471. per annum, to the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the town of Beverley, and to their succes sors for eaver, in trust that they shouid pay yearly unto the preachler orZ lectuirer of the said town and bis successors te sm of 101., to the 8choolmaster and his successors the sum of 101., axdh unto three poor scholars of the school of the town for their bettermainteinuce at the University of Cambridge. unto each the sum of 6t. 13s. 4d. yearly. The estao so left had since become worth 1301. per annum, and a second estate left hy the tftator to the a pellants in trust to pay the peer of the said town the sam of 201. year was now worth 42t. per annum. The appellants, a fertpaying the sum before-rentioned, had carried the surplus to the account of the borough fund for the generalpurpsos aof the corporation. The Attorney Mr loy audean informatiornagainst them for the purpom of having it declared that the surplus ought to be applied to charitable purposes. By a decree of the Lords u~stices, inadein J3anuary, 1855, an order was made inL conformity 'with the prayer of the information. This declhion was new appeled from, and, after hcaring the arguments, Teir Lordships adjourned the further consideration until Friday next. Mir. Lloya and Mr. Karslake were counsel for the appel. lants, and the Attorney-General and Mr. J. H. Terrellre presented the respondents.

VICE-CHNCELLORS' COURTS, MoN-DA. Jimy 2S. MMMXO V- Ppnr.rn- Vtefore .ch alwnceaor lSir BR. T. KINDTeR,T.V.V I mThis case was opened on Thursday last, and stood over until to-day for further hearing. The case comes on upon exceptions to the Master's report under these circumstances: -In the year 1849 the Great Northern Railway Company took four acres of Hadley-common (which originally formed part of Enfield-chase), andi a committee of commoners 'was formed to agree with the company as to the value and distribution of the purchase-money. The committee not being able to agree, by arbitration 1,400!. was decided as the value of the land, timber, and for severance; and that sum was paid to them. But it then appeared that the rights of the commoners were in a great state of confusion, and disputes arose as to the nature of those rights, and this bill was filed by certain commoners on behalf of themselves and the other commoners against 'he committee, whowerethem. selves commeners. A decree was made by the present Lord Cbancellor directing the fund to bQ brought into court, with a reference to the M1aster to distribute it among the commoners according to their rights. The same difficulties were Etill found in ascertaining the rights, and the Master had, as it was said, by mutual agreement, thought that he might distribute the fund among the parisiooners of Hadley according to the rate at which they were assessed to the poor. The report on that footing -was confirmed, and the cause was set down; but before it came on two of the plaintiffs made an affidavit, stating that certain old documents had been found, removing the doubts about the rights of commouners, and all Darties thought It desirable that the matter should go back to the Master to distribute the fund according to the decree. Meantime the difficulties of carrying out the decree had not diminished, and the Master still thought it equally as impossible as before, and abided by his former decision. The fund had increased to 1,6001, and the question now was whether certain rules made in 1777, under the 17th George IIL, or other rules made In 1843, to regulate the commonable right, should prevail. Hadley-common was formerly a part of Enfield-chase, belonging to the Crown, in right of the Duchy of Lancaster, and by the Act in questionedmonton, South Mims, Enfield, and Monken Hladey were enclosed, and certain portions of the chase were awarded to each parish, but te rights of commoners were left untouched. That portion assigned to Hadley was 240 acres, 50 acres to the rectorinlihenof tithei andtheresiduewasvested in thechurch. wardens in trust for thebenefit of theowners of freeholds, copyholds, and lessebolds, their beirs and assigns, entitled to rights of common within the chase, according to their several rights and interests therein. The act in question gave power to a meeting of parishioners to make rules for the regulation or stnt of the right of common of the commoners, but that such rules should not have validity unless confirmed at a subsequent meeting, such rules then to be signed. Such a meeting took place in 1777, and rules were made and subsequently confirmed; and in 1799 the like course was pursued; and those rules were abided by up to 1843, when disputes arose and new rules were made. The order confirming the Master's report had been discharged, and the case now came on upon exceptions to the Master's subsequent opinion. Mr. HARDY appeared in support of the exceptions for the five] defendants, and contended that the rules of 1777 regulated the rights of the commoners, and that nothing done since had abrogated such rights. Mr. BA Y and Mr. COrrTXLL appeared for the plaintiffs and argued that the defendants' contention could not be the just one, for if the case was governed by the rules, the commoners who were entitled to the corps would not get fair shares, but if according to the assessment of the poor each would get a fractional part. Mr. HAaWY was heard in reply. The VIcx-CE }cEsLon thought that both himself and the Master were bound by this decree, although when that decree was made the abstract question might be open. The money in question arose from the corpus of the property, and there ore prirnd facie, the rights of the commoners ought to regulate its distribution. The declaration in the decree was that the fund ought to be distributed among the owners, proprietors of freehold or copyhold messuages, their heirs, assigns, lessees, tenants, or under-tenants, who at the time of the sale (1849) were entitled to rights of common over the said lands of Hadley according to their several rights of common therein. Now, irrespective of theAct or rules,the word " therein" there applied to Hadley-common, and the decree must be interpreted with the object of discovering who were to participate, and in what proportion; and for that purpose any evidence raust be used. The time must be 1849, and the Act must be looked at for the purpose. The scope was to take away all rights in Enfield-chase, and give some compensation for them-one portion of land to one parish and one to another, and so on,-so this parish 190 acres. The Act did not prescribe how the persons were to be ascertained, but it did prescribe the mnode of regulating the enjoyment, by vesting the legal estate in fee-simple in the churchwardens and their successors for the time being, to hold in trust for the owners, proprietors of freehold or copyhold messuages, lands, or tenements within the parish, their heirs, or assigns, lessees, tenants, and under-tenants for the time being, entitledtorightsofcommon within the chase, accordingto their several estates and interests therein. This was language idem sonans with the decree, but the word " therein" here referred to rights of common and not to the place. His Honour then referred to the Act, which, he observed, empowered the churchwardens to make rules as to dealing with encroachments by money payments, &c., and such rules were only vald when confirmed by the majority of landowners assessed to land-tax at not less than 10l. a-year, and this therefore rnight not include parties beneficialy interested and assessed at less. The Act drew a distiniction between the right and enjoyment, showing that the right meant was a right of common only to the extent of depasturing cattle, and that the land should not be enjoyed as by ordinary cestuiquc trusts, but as they had it before, In Enfield-chase, until rules were made, and those rights not of digging gravel, &c. The body to make rules could not alter the commoners' rights, but their successors could vary the rules made by them, That had been done in 1799, but not so as to affect this question. Finding, therefore, that the decree dealt with rights of common, and-tbe Act drew a distinction between rights of common and other rights, the rights of oommon must prevail, and the rules of 1777 and 1799 were the more certain test, and must be adhered to, rather than that of the assessment to the poor. The exceptions must be allowed, and the matter must be referred to chambers, and, as he (the Vice-Chaucellor) would there personally superintend it, no declaration would now be made. (Before Vice-Chanceaor SirW. P. WOOD.) BROOKE V. GAItROD. In this suit, which was instituted for the admaiinistration of the trusts of the will of Henry Garrod, of Gooderstone, in the county of Norfolk, a questlon arose as to the right of pre-emption given by the will of one of the defendants. The testator, by his will, bearing date the 23d of July, 1856, authorized and directed his trastees and executors to offer all his real estate in Gooderstone, Oxburgh, and Cockley Cleymi Norfolk or elewhere, to his brother, the defendant, Mallows Garrod, at the price of 2,500., and upon payment of this sum to convey such real estate unto and to the use of Mallows Garrod, but in case he should not be living at the time of the testator's death, or should not within one month after that event, tsignify his intention to accept and take the said hereditaments and premises at the price specified, or should not at the expiration of two months from the time signify his intention to pay the said suim to the trustees, then the trustees were empowered to sell the property by publc auction or private contract, and stand possessed of the proceeds upon certain trusts. The real estate, the subject of this devise, had been given by the will of their father to the testator and Mallows Garrod, to hold as tenants in common. No partition had been made, and certain mortgages had been created upon the estate by the testator and Mallows Garrod. The testator died on the 11&thof October, 1856. On the 29th of October MaUolws Garrod, by his solicitor, stated his desire to take the testator's real estate at 2,5001., and required the solicitor of the trustees to send the neces;sary abstracts of title as early as possible. On the 3d of November the solicitor for the trustees acknowledged the receipt of the letter sent on behalf of Mallows Garrod, and stated that he would take an early opportunity of seeing his cients thereon. It appeared that nothing further passed until the 14th of Januntry, 1857, when a communication took place between the solicitors. Upon this occasion Mr. Grigson, the solicitor for the trustees, stated that his clients intended to convey the estate to Mallows Garrod, but as the title deeds werein the possession of the mortgagees, his clients were not bound to furnish an abstract of title, and that, as MaUows Garrod would derive so great a benefit under his brother's will, he ought not to put the estate to the expense of an abstract.

The CosunssxoNR referred to certain opinions of the Lords Justices In respeet to a commodation-b11s, and the case of a bankrupt named Ryder, and said he could not concur in those opinions as reported. Mr. John Robinson, examined, said,-On oing, aLoupt the end of Febrar_. ILA, for an account, the bank; rit offered him an accep';ance of one William Tent. Tent, Le. said, was a respectab'e person on the Stock-Exchange. I le said he did not give him any acceptances in return; but, .t being pressed, he said he hid done so on one occasion; tha' I bill had, however, "run off." Witness replied, ` If you have, given acceptances to Tent I have no tter opinion of him than I have of you." Tha bankrupt then said Tent was a very respectable maan, and that his bills would be paid as they always had been paid. This conversation took place about six weeks before Teat's ban'kruptcy. The Cosmmsios .-I see that Mr. Commissioner iolroyd has adjourned Tent's examination sine die, there being no accunts. Examination eontinued.-He took Tent's bill because he declined to trust Ward alone. Aftor Tent failed Ward said that he (Ward) was overwFhelmed with accommodation paper.

He began to suspect, frequently seeing the bills of Tent. This made him desirous to ascertain whether there was any accommodation between them. The CoamnsssoNER (to Mr. Chidley).-Do you propose td examine the bankrupt ? Mr. CEIDLY.-No. I cannot call him to alter facts. The COSMMSIoiNm-The course is a credit to you. It is infimitely better to take such a course than to put a man into a position to commit perjury. After a few remarks by Mr. BAGLEY, The Co nprsiom Said there wvas trong evidence that three parties had been acting in concert for the purpose of defrauding parties with whom they dealt. 'here were features in the case of a very grave and serious character. There might have been a conspiracy. He should wish to have the statements of the other two bankrupts before he formed his opinion of the csue. He should also wish to obtain an authentio report of what Lord Justice Knight Bruce had said in the cases referred to, and he might himself apply to his Lordship on the subject. It was the duty of this Court to ve judgments in accordance with that of the sperior uourt, and not to subject parties unnecessarily to the great expense of appeal.

TBIRMflt0E.tAt CAXAL COh5, Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Chance appear(d for thie -plaintiff, and Mr. Whateley, Q. C., and Mlr. 1'hipson for the defendants. The plaintiff Thomas Whitehouse, was a brickmakernear Oldbury, and Le sued the Birmingham Canal Company to recover damages for an injury done to his premises by the xegligenc of the defendanxts in the managemertt of their canaL It appeared in evidence that sOme time ago one of the branches of the defendants' canal, called the " Jinm Crovr branch," burst, and the water flooded the plaintiff's prezaises and did considerable damage. The defendants' case was that the flood was entirely owing to an unwsual storn of rain, and that there had been no negligence on the part of the company. Aftera lengthened inquir,v the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 701. damagyes; but The learned .1tJ UDa directed the verdict to be entered for the defendants, giving the plaintiff leave to move to enter the verdict in his favour for the amount found by the jury. HIZELDlDE V. HA.PTON A-ND WIFE. Air. Huddleston, Q.C., and Mr. Byrne appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Skinner, Q-C., and Mr. Phipson for the defendants. This was an action in which the pIaintife, Henry Hazeldine, sought to recover damages from the defendant, Samuel Hampton, and Phcebe, his wife, for a breach of promise of marriage committed by the lady, The defendants pleaded the general issue, and also that the plaintifl -was not ready and willing, and that the agreement had been rescinded by mutual consent. Mr. HUDDLESTrO, In opening the case, stated that the plaintiff, Henry Hareldine, was a farmer, innrkeeper, and butcher at Stourbridge. Being a young man, 26 years o age, he had formed an attachment to a lady of about the same age named Phosbe Darby, the daughter of the late Mr. Darby, maltster and farmaer at Brierly-hill. The attachment originated at a pic-nie party which, in the autumn of tho year 1S53, visited the Clent-hills. Henry flazeldine and Phrebe Darby were both at the pie-nic, and from that day they became warmly attached to one another. Before long they were engaged to be married, but, as sometimes happens, Phiebc's papa did not approve the match. Ho was said to bo an obstinate old man, but his daughter, who was of the same disposition as her father, was determined to carry out the engagenment into which she had entered. Indeed, there was no reason why the match should be opposed; for, though the defendant, MIrs. Hampton, was now entitied to 10ol. a-year, under the will of her father, who was now dead, the plaintiff's family wero equa'lly respectable with that of Mr, Darby. The engagemoent was made in September, 155M, and Eoon after the lady went on a visit to the house of the plaintiff's father, wbere she was received as one of tho family. The plaintiff made her numerous,presents from time to time, and received in return several letters, in which she acknowledged his kindness. In a letter written to her " dear Hlenry" Phsebo assured her lover that she had been crying all the time she had been writing the letter, and that "- she would think no snore of G. W." (Laughter.) In another letter she said, " We shall ineet in heaven; they cannot parb us there ;" and she assured the plaintiff she would not mind what people said. In September she wrote to him to send her " a 10.-note and kisses past counting" (laughter), and, in case the thought of the kisses should make the plaintiff forget the note, she added, "Please to send the money in answer to this note." In October she wrote to say she hiad seea a cape which her father would mot give her money to buy, and, after asking the plaintiff to send her 101. or 201., concluded by saying, " I cannot sleep for thinkiDg of you." (Laughter.) The gist of a lady's letter was said to be in the postscript, and one of Miss VDarby's had this-" P.S. Let me have that money, becauco I have a bill or two to pay." (Laughter.) In March, 1856, she wrote in a similar strain, saying she wanted the plaintiffl to lend her a small sum of money, and concluded " Send it in notes. With love to you, I remain, yours for ever I'Pheobe." Her eternity, however, did not last long, for in April there was a quarrel; but she made it up, sayingr that they ought to " forget and forgive." In June, 1856, she wrote to the plaintiff telling him she could not see him the next Sunday, because her father (Mr. Darby) had died at 20 minutes to 2 that morning. Raving thus briefly disposed of that matter, the letter went on, "II expect to bave a bother about you. I am born to trouble. But in all my trouble r do not forget you. With love, yours for ever, Phwbe Darby." The narriage was originally fixed to take place in MIarch, 1856, but it was postponed, and when the father died Miss Darby asked to be allowedto come and stay at the house of the plaintiff's father. There she was received vith open arms; butafteratimneshewentto reside atth house of Mr. Vernon, a draper. While there the wedding dress -was bought, and everything was prepared for the wedding. But, unhappily, another pie-nio was had, at the "H Habberley Valley," and to this pic-nic the plaintiff was iot invited. The defendant Samuel Hampton was there, aud from that day the plain,tiff was neglected and slighted, and lhen he remonstrated he was laughed and sneored at, as he -would probably be to-day. After a short courtship the defendants were narried on the 5th of DecemberS 1856, but, though she had refunded the money which the plaintiff had given her, at least as much as the plaintiff could prove she had received, ehe st511 retained the other presents.' The learned counsel enlarged on the advantage which it would have been to the plaintiff to have had a wife with 1001, a-year. Mr. Baron B]itAM,WL said it was ditTerent at the bar, There, it was said, a iean first spent his own fortune' then married a wife and spent hers, and after that began to work. (Laughter.) Mr. RIuDDLESrON said no doubt Miss Darby made the defendant (Mir. Hampton) a comfortable wife; and, if so, she would have made the plaintiff equally comfortable. She had lured the plaintiff on with well founded prospects ef happiness, and those, prospects ought not to be dashed withoub making compensation, The following witnesses v:ere then called and examined:Mary Elizabeth Parkes said,-About tvwo years ago I be4cavue intimate with Miss Darbv. I saw her at our house. She wrote a note to the plaintiff, and he came and took her home. Shortly after I went with a party to Clent-hills. The party was got up at Miss Darby's suggestion. It, was in August or September, 1S55. The plaintiff' and hiss Darby -went home together to Mr. parby a. They often met after that at our house. She often told me that neither her father nor any one else should, alter her opinion of the plain. tii, and that she preferred him to every one else. I was askel by Miss Darby to act as bridesmaid. That was in Fiobruary, 1856. She showed me presents which the plain. tiff had made her, the wedding dress, chimney drhameiuts, and ohain. She asked me to make out the list, of things she would require. That was in July. I made out this list at her dictation :-Two white bonnets, one trimmed with three white featbers tinged with blue, one trimmed with Alo'rers, two white falls, one sky-blue tie, one drab ditto, two pair white kid gloves, No. 9, two ditto, No. 64 and 7V. 2Neok ribands. That was with a view to the marriage. It was reuerally understood they were to be married. I remember Miss Darby going to stay at Mr. Vernon's in 1856 a few n,ontbs before her marriage. I saw a wedding dress at Mr. HIazeldine's; M-iss Darby told me that was to be her wedding dress. Cross-examined by Mr. 'SsxsNNm.-The blue tint was her own idea, and she asked me to writeit down. I used to visit at the lazeldines. Not Henry, but the other lazeldine is miy young man. I have been " luring him on" more thaa three years. (Laughter.) It was a gold chain Miss Darby said the plaintiff had bought for her. The plaiutiff said he bad her watch and chain. He did not say he had taken it from her to have security for the money he had lent her. I know the plaintiff inNovember sued the defendant and got some money back. I don't know whetber it 'was 331. r should not think' it a mark of affection if my Hazeldine was to bring an action against me. (Laughter.) I know the plaintiff got his money, but, I don't know the amount. That was sboxtly before the marniage with Mr. Rampton. I believe the marriage with plaintiff was broken offat that time. I never heard plaintiff say she udght "go to h-." I don't know that he saw her after he took the watch from her. He told me he had the watch. He did zot say he had struck hez in the mouLth, and broke the chain. Re-examined by Mr. HuDDLEsTo-z.-I never heard about his striking her before to-day. I am engaged to be married to one of the Hazeldines. I never treated my llazeldine as Miss Darby treated hers. The plaintiff said Aliss Darby went out for a time, that she did'nt write to him, and an her return she would not see him. The plain. tiff told me thit if sbe married anybody else he should enter an action against her, and he would never conisent to her marrying anybody else. He appeared to be fund of her, and showed her every attention, and when he knew of Hamspton the plaintiff appeared much " cut up." By the JuDGz.-The marriage was broken off before the watch was got. William flazeldine, examined by Mr. HVDDLESTOrs.-I am the father of the plaintiff. I have seven children, four of whom are sons. The plaintiff is my eldest son. I am a farmer, innkeeper, and butcher. I knew old Darby. He was amaltster and in the coal trade, at Mount Pleasant. He had the defendant and another daughter._ My son is 25 and Mss Darby was about the same age. I kiew of the attachment in 18lf55. Miss Darby came to stay at my house on several occasions. I heard ber father objected. I had no objection. I thought mine was quite as good as his'n. She ddi not care about herfather, nor no one. (Langbter.) She -sed to come, and I thought they were quite loving (Laugbter.) They did as they ought to do-lovers like them (Laughter.) In August, 1856, 1 was about to give iup my butcher's business to my son, in contemplation of his muar- riage. My son had ordered furniture at Packwood's. I don't know anything about present., ntonsense like that. (Laughter.) When I heard about Hanipton my son seemed much hurt about it. That was after Miss Darby went to stay at Vernon's. Hampton is something in the coal line or rime trade. Cross-examined by Mr. S Nmsa. -I knew my Fon had the watch. Ee told me that " her" gave hima the watch towards somennoney "her"had hadfrom him. I did not seethat the chain was roken. When the action was brought against Miss Derby I believe sho paid the money. She paid 321. or 331., but I don't know anything abont 5f. costs. I do not know that was in November. I have met Hampton iu the streets, and I havo called " Cackoo *" but I did not call " Cuckoo" to him, but to the birds. '(Laughter.) I said it to the birds up in the trees. I did not know Hampton was 'tbere, anti )did not intend to affront hibm. Perhaps the plaintiff may have said " Cuckoo" to the detendant in my presence to insult him. (The witness prevartcated so mueh on this point that the learued JUnDQi said he had a great mind t comumit him.) B-examined by Mr. HunDDLnSTrnsr.-I said e Cac'Koo" yesterday and this morning. The defendant Was not present. Joseph 'Vernon, examined by bMr. HUIDa- Tor.-I am a Araper at tltourbridge. la February, ISSU, I ist knew of the plaintiffe engagement to Miss Darby. In July and August last shoe was staying at my house. It was mentioned in her presence that the plaintiff's father was going to give Op his butcher's business to the plaintiff, who wns buying furniture. She said she was determined to marry the p aintiff. She told me she bad 41. a-week from some houses, which amuoLnted to 2001. a-year, but she afterwards said it was not so mauch. Cross-examined by Mr. SKR}LNEIt-I have spoken against the defendant, aad wrote to Mr. Hampton about her. She had some boxes at my house. The plaintiff often carue to any house in her absence. I do not know that orne of the boxes wv broken opea. Re-examined by Mr. HUDDLBESTON.-I spoke against the defendaut in consequeace of the manner in which she treated the laintiff. Wiiam Elazeldine was here recalled, atnd denied that he had eversaid that " at htst we thought it was a - nice tbing for our Harry, and rather urged it on; bat when we found bow the will was left vwe thought it was a - good thing, as we thought her of rno account without her money. ' Re-examined by Mr. HUDDLESTON.-I never knew how the will was left. The mazriage certificate, showing that the defendants were married oa the 30th of December, 1856, was then put in. This was the plaintiff's case. Mr. SieiiNxEn, then addressed the jury for the defendapt, and in so doing said he had heard of mean actions before, but he thought the present was the meanest, and at the same time the most audacious, which had ever been brought into court. The plaintiff and his father had been insulting the defendant by calling out " Cuckoo" in the public streets, and he now had the audacity to come into court and to ask the jury to give hima damages, so that ho might support himself out of the lady's pocket. It appeared that Miss Derby's father died in June, D1856, and instead of the "billing and cooing" of which the plaintiff's counsel had spoken it would appear that soon after the death the plaintiff called on 3iSs Darby, and having torn her own watch and chain from her neck he said to her, " There, d- you, you may go to h-; I have got what I want," and went away. 'This gentleman, who bad been "lured" by the young lady, broke the cdain of the watch, and when she came out of the room sihe was Eeen with a piece of the broken chain in her hand, 4sud her month bleeding from his violence. It was said the defendant had made an appointment to meet the plaiAtiff in beaven; but it w as clear the plaintiff did not mean to keep that appointiAeut, for he told the young lady to 'I go to helL" (Laughter.) Surely that looked very much liko break. ing off the marriage. But, more than that, on-the:23d of September he instructed his attorney, Mr. Addenbrpok, to apply to MisaDarby to return the sumof 331., andthrcatened her with an action. In the correspondence which 'ensued tho jlaintiff's attorney admitted that he had taken away the lady s watch and chain, in the first instance, without her consent; and it would appear that the young lady's boxes had been broken open at Mr. Vernon's, and the presents taken out. The next "love letter" w hich the plaintiff sent Miss Darby was in the shape of a writ of summons, beginning "Victoria, by the grace of God of theunited kingdom," &c. (laughter), and it summoned her, not into the " Court of Love," but into " the Exchequer of Pleas." (Laughter.) All this was done at the sult of ":onry Hazeldine," and the epistle was signed with the namue of Sir Frederick Pollock, Kat., who no doubt would be sorry to have anything to do with such a party as the plaintiff. (Laughter.) In the result Miss Darby paid the plaintiff his 331., and 51. for costs. These proceedings the learned counsel contended shovved that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to marry the defendant, and that the contract had been mutually rescinded. The fact was Mr. Darby, who died in June, 185B, had left his property in strict settlement ; and this fact had become well known by Sentember, and as soon as the plaintiff found he could not touch Miss Darby's money he immnediately gave her up, took away her v atch as security for the money he had given her, and sued her to get it back. What, then, had the plaintiff lost9 Suppose the Lord Clhancellor led decreed a specific performance of the contract, wvould the plaintiff have married the lady?' The learned counsel thought not, and that the plaintiff had not sustained any damsgo whatever. The following witnesses were thou cailed for the defend- Sarah Eampton, examined by Mr. 1'HipsoNz.-I am the sister of Mr. Samuel Hampton. I became acquainted with Miss Darby in A.ugust last at Mr. Vernon's. I afterwards invited Miss Darby to my father's house. On one occasion the plaintiff fetehed her home. Miss Darby and I afterwards went to pay a visit at my brother Isaac Hampton's. On my return MiAss Darby cane to stay at my father's house. 'lhe plaintiff called and was shown into a room where she was. Thero was a noise in the room. My brother Isaac went in and came out. The plaintiff then went out and got on his horse. When Miss Datby came out of the room her month was bleeding, and she had no watch, but only a bit of a chain in her hand. She had left her boxes at Mr. Vernon's. She sent for them, and one of them, a small one, had the clasp broken. My brother, Mr. Samuel Hampton, -was not paying his addresses at that time. He did not begin till five weeks after. The plaintiff did not call after that. Shc remained at my father's house till the marriage, wvhich took place in December, 185G. Cross-examined by lr. HUDubST0oi.-I can't say my brother's courtship was a month or six weeks. I can't say how long it was. They are fond of one another.

Baron BRAsi WLL in sunaming up said it 1.aS no past of his duty as a judge to find any fault with the law wvhich allowed an action of this hind to be brought just the same as if it bad been a contract for the sale of corn. HIis Lordship, however, observed that such actions wvere often foolishly brought, and of all the actions he lied ever kntown the present seemed to he the moat objectless. If the dury gave the plaintiff a verdict, what damnages could they (give himu? What was the plaintiff's loss? Suppose the woui,an had boeen coaxed away or had cessed to like the Plaintiff, or thoughb Hampton tho best match, int either case his Ford-snptugttebstcrewolhaeentoidhr snhpthnoght tho best colirso would have been obi e good bye. But if the defendants' case was true, anc the laintiff had treated her in the unmanly manner st2ted,, and nad told her to go to h- when he was taking her waLtch away from her, could he, when he canme into cuurt, and'was mean enough to have her letters read, expect a jary to give him damages? His Lordship thought not. The question, however, was whether the defendant had broken, her promise without the consent of the plaiutiff. His Lordship then directed the attention of the jury to the evidence as bearing upon that point, and said that if they found a verdiet for the plaintiff he should be disappointed if they gave him any more than the. smallest damages. The jury found a verdict for the defendants. CRDIRNAL CotTRT.-(BeforC Mfr. Baron MARnrsi.) Matthias Wood, a respectable-looking man, was charged with bigamy, in marrying Susan Allea at Tewkesbnry on the 30th of September, 1841, his former wife, Phcebe Wood, being still alive. Mir. Xettlo appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Powelf defended the prisoner. It appeared that so far back as the year 1833 the Prisoner was married to a young woman named Phiebe Drinkwater, at Grinstead, in Northamptonshire. Soon after the sparriage, for sonic reason which was not explained, the prisoner left bis wife, and came to reside at Upton-upon-Severn, in this county, and in September, 1841, he was married at the Baptist Cbapel at Tewkesbury to a young woman named Susan Allen, with whom he had lived up to the present time, and by whom ho had bad seven children. le bad maintained a character at Upton as a good husband, a gcod father, and a good neighbour for the last 16 years. It hpleared that the first, wife was living at Bedford, in which town the prisoner's mother resided, and it was stated that the prosecution was instituted b)y thefirst wife.. Mr. POIVELL said he was, unable to refist X conavicton upon the facts proved. Tlhe jury having Conveiced the prisoner, lii-, POw.Yx read a cerstiface signed by the reclbr, churchwardens, and several of the most vespectable inhabitants of IUpton st4ting that the prisoner bad for 16 years lived at Upton, and conducted him6elf as a good husband and father. When taken into custody the prisoner stated that he had left his first wife because she was in the habit of going with other men, and that he believed she was now living with & policeman. iMr. Baron MARTEN said that in these cases he Always wished to get at the real facts, and to know who the real prosecutor was. His Lordship, having taken time to make inquiries, ulimately sentenced the prisoner to two months' imprisonment. TIIE RIDDERMtXS'TJr RIOTERS. Afr. IJuDDLESTOX, Q C. (with whom were Mr. Best and AMr. Byrne), said true bills had been found against 10 persons whose names were in the calendar, and also agahinst two other persons who were not charged before the magistrates, for a riot at the late Kidderminster election. The learned counsel, on the part of the d4fendants, applied that the cases imight all stand over tiU the next assizes. Mr. Wx&AraLrY, Q.C., who (with Afr. Skinner and Mr. Kettle) appeared for the prosecution, said he could not oppose the application. AMr. Baron AIARTIN said that with respect to two of the defendants it was merely a matter of right that this trial should be postponed; and, as it was inex_pedieut that there should be two trials on the same facts, ail the cases might stand over. The recognizances of the defendants must be enlarged. (Before Ms.. Baron BXlAarnL.) hr. Baron BRASIvELL, having disposed of aU the civil business, proceeded to assist in the trial of prisoners. Joseph Allmark was charged with the manslaughter of Richard Dunn on the 29th of September, 1856, at Oldbary. The grand jury had thrown out the bill for murder. Mr. Byrne appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Cook Erans, at the request of the learned judge, defended the prisoner. ft appeared that on the 27th of Septeniber, 1856, the prisoner, with some other men, went into the shop of the deceased man, Richard Dann, who was a blacksmith. He began pulling the blacksmith's tools about, and was told that if he could not keep quiet he must go out of the shop, The deceased advanced towards the prisoner and motioned to him to leave, but, instead of leaving, the prisoner struck the deceased a blow on the face. The deceased struck the prisoner on tbe chest aud also slapped his face. He then returned to his work at the forge, and took out a piece of iron to hammer on the anviL The prisoner stood for four or five minutes, and then took up thae handle of a pickaxe, and with it struck the deceased a blow on the head. The man fell down and was carried horae, but died soon after the injury. The blow struck the deceased on the left temple and fractured the skull on the top, and caused an extravasation of blood on the brain, which caused death. MIr. Coox EvNs having addressed the jury for the prisoner, He was found Guilty, but recommended to mercy on account of his youth. Air. Baron BRArWELL sentenced the prisoner to 15 years' penal servitude. GOA' ND JURY ROO3T. In consequence of the large amount of business at these assizes it became necessary this mnorning to constitute a third court. Mr. Whateley, Q.C., accordingly sat throughout the day in the grand jury-room and tried a good many prisoners. This enabled the judges to bring the business of the assizes to a close this day, which is the day appointed to open the cornmission at Stafford.

SHE CIZY OF OX?PO.R ELECZION. IFROM OTUR OnWV RtPtnlq!P- t OXFORD, MONDiY PVMqN'G. The nomination of candidates to represent the city of Osford in the room of Mr. Neate, who had been unsea;td by a committee of the Hoose of Commons on the charge of bribery, took place this afternoon at the Town-hall, Oxford. A procession of the friends of the two candidatcs, Afr, Carddwell and Mr. Thackeray, arrived at the place appointo i about 12 o'clock. Mr. Cardwell himself was not present, but Ms. Thackeray and his friends attended punctually at the hour appointed. Each party greeted their friends in the usual electioneering spirit. The prelimiuary proceedings having been gone through, a question arose as to whieh party should Est address the electors, there being cries for " Neate," "Thackeray," and "Cardwell." The MAXoIs said he was not aware that any difference of opinion could exist as to the party who should first address the meeting. Every good thing, and every good man, and almost every other good that wvas spreading its irduence throughout the world came from and took their initiative at Oxford. (I*ugthter, and cries of "Towvle, you're a Mfr. Alderman WAusaI then came forward and proposed the Right Hon. Edward Cardwell as a candidate to represent the city of Oxford inL Parliament. The object of the electors was to get business men into the House of COn\mons. Mr. Cardwell was eminently such a man, and he was satisfied that if they elected him they would not have any reason to regret their choice. MIr. ex-Sheriff CASTLE seconded the nomination. Mr. DAW (Town-councilman) then came forward and proposed Mr. Thackeray as a fit and proper person to reprosent the city of Oxford in Parliament. (Cheers.) He felt confident that if that eminent literary man, whose talents bad been exerted in tho cause of all that was practically beneficial to the people of this country, weire sent into the House of Commons he would infuse into that body a new spirit, and arouse it to a sense of its duty towards the working classes of this country, whose interests he had so long and so ably advocated. (Cheers.) Ir. BuxER secoeded the nomination in a long and eloquent speech, which was frequently cheered. Mdr. TulAOxXAY then came forward, and was rcceived with rounds of applause. After the cheering had subsided lbe said,-Freemen and electors of Oxford, as I came down to this place I saw on each side of me placards announcing that there was no manner of doubt that on Tuesday the friends of the Right Hon. Edward Cardwell would elect him toaseatinParliament. Isasosawotherplacards announcing in similar terms a confidence that there 'was no doubt that I should be elected to a seat in Parliament for the city of Oxford. Now, as both sides are perfectly confidernt of success-as 1, for my part feel perfectly confident, and as my opponents entertain the same favourable opinion in regard to themselv-s-surely both sides may meet here on this occaasion in perfect good humour. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, you have heard my proposer and seconder, and what it is that they have had to urge in my favour. I wish it were in mny power to make so able a speech as my seconder has done in support of my cause. (Cheers.) You have also heard what the sponsors of the nght hon. gentleman ML Vardwell have had to urge in his bebalf; you have seen his godfathers, but where's the " babby "' (Laughter.) Why is that interesting creature not here and presented before you ? Laughter, and cheers.) I wanted most especially to see Xr. ardwell, because, in the first place, I wished to shake hands with him, as I am sure we shall heartily do when this contest is over- but I also wished to see him because I was desirous of as6dng him a few questions, though possibly they may not altogether have been convenient for him to answer. They were, however, put to me boldly enougb, and I aniwered. themn plainly enough; but Mr. Cardwell is in the shade-in the cloud -in the fog. His answers are misty and his conduct is similarly obscure. (Loud cheers.) You have heard your worthy mayor, and what is it that he has said? He said ihat every good thing and almost every good man was initiated in Oxford. (Cheers and laughter.) I hope you will show to-morrow that a good member of Parliament may be initiated in Oxford. (Cheers.) I promise you I will do my hest to prove the correctness of yeor mayor's prediction in that particular. I hear that not long since-in the memory of many now alive-this independent city was patronized by a great university, and that a great duke, who lived not very fax from here, at the time of election used to put on his boots and ride down and order the freemen of Oxford to elect a member for him. (Laughter.) Any man who has wandered through your beau. tiful city as I have done within these latter days cannot but be struck with the difference between the ancient splendour, the academic grandeur that prevailed in this place-the processions of dons, doctors, and proctors-and your new city, which is not picturesque or beautiful at all, but which contains a numnber of streets, peopled by thousands of hardworking, honest, rough-handed, kind-hearted, and truehearted men. (Cheers.) These men have grown up of late years, and have asserted their freedom, and their determination to have a representative of their own. (Cheers.) Such a representative they found three months ago, and such a representative they returned to Parliament in the person of eay exceUent friend Mr. Neate. But such a representative was turned out of that Parliament by a sentence which I cannot call unjust, because he himself is too magnanimous and generous to say so, but which I will say was iniquitous. (Cheers.) Hle was found guilty ot a twopennyworth of bribery which he never comnitted, and a Parliament which has swallowed so many camels strained at that little gnat, and my friend, your representative, the very best mars you could find to represent you, was turned back, and you were left without a man. (Cheers.) I cannot hope, I never thought, to equal him; I only came forward at alnoment when -I though t t necessary that some one professinghisprinciples, and professing yours, should be ready to step into the gap which he had uade. (Cheers.) Iknow that the place was very eagerly sought for by other folks on the other side entertaininig other opinions. Perhaps you don't know that last week there was a Tory baronet down here, walkiDg about in the shade. as umbrageous almost as that under which MIr. Caidwell has sheltered himself. (Cbeers.) Of course you blow there camo down a Ministerial nominee- Lord Monok ; but you do not know that Mr. Eayter, who is what is called the whipper-in for the Ministerial party, came down here also on Saturday week in a dari and mysterious manner, and that some conversation took place the nature of which Icannot pretend to know anything about, because I have no spies, however people may be lurking at the doors of our comraittee-room. (Cheers.) lut the result of all was that Lord Monek disappeared, and Mr. Hayter vanished into darkness and became a myth (laughter and cheers); and we were informed that a powerful requisition from the city of Oxford had invited gr. CardwelL (" Oh, oh !") Mind, Mr. Cardwell has given no note in reply-no mark, no sign. We do not know, even now, whether he accepted that polite invitation. We do not know it even to this day, except that his godfathers have been here, and havesaidso. (Cheers.) After the manner in which the eleetors of Oxford have received me, could I possibly have gone back simply because we were told that Mr. CardweeU had received an invitation which we did not know whether he had accepted or not? I felt it, therefore, to be my humble duty to stand in the place where I fond mnyself. 1 do not know that I would have ventured to oppose Mr. Cardwell under other circumstances. I am fully aware of his talents. I know his abilty as a statesman, and no man can say that I have, during the whole of my canvass, uttered a word at all unfriendly or disrespectful towards that gentleman. (Cheers.) I should have h9sitated on any other occasion in opposing him, but I cannot hesitate now, because I know that we have the better cause, andthat we mean to make that better causeotriumphant. (Cries ofI"No, no;" "Yes, yes.") The facts are pretty clearly before you. Three months ago what did you do with Ulr. Cardwell when he presented himself before you? [A voice.-"Why, we turned him oot."j Why did you turn him out? Because he belonged to a party in whom you had no confidence-because he be longed to a party whose conduct at the commencement of the late war was believed to be fatal to the interest and honour of this county (cheers), and because he belonged to a party in Parliament which, if allowed to prevail, and which, if it had not been kicked out by the indignant feellDg of the country as it was kicked out, would haveprevailed, wouldhave plunged us deeply into degradation, and wouldhavehad uslicking theboots of theEmperor of Russia. (Cheers.) It is my deliberate belief that the party to which MIr. Cardwell belongs did, by crliging to the Xmperor of Russia, cause him to believe that we should never fight, and thatthat wasthereal causeofthellussianwar. (Loudcheers.) I say that during the inception of that war the Peelite party, withl the exception of the Dake of Newcastle, who, I think, was ill-used, exhibited the most lamentable uant of foresight and the greatest imbecility, and that they turned tail on their opponents. (Cheers.) They were afraid; they prated about the destinies of Russia, and were ready to give up theoTurks to Russian domination. (Cheers.) The same impotent system has characterized the speeches, conduct, and opinions of the members of that party upon all foreign questions ever simce. Take, for instauce, the Chinese war; what has been their conduct in regard to that question? Why, they have on every occasion taken the side of those miserable cut-throats-those scoundrels vwho are murdering and butcbering our people and trampling on our flag. (Cheers.) It was only last Saturday that there came before Parliament the questin of the Persian war, and then Mr. Gladstonse (th chief of thle party to which Mr. Cardwell belongs) rose and began carpig about that wrar. Mr. Gladstone does not want us to go to wrar; and when Her Majesty's Ministers spcoke of fighting, h came forward ald, made a 'paerile sippeal to rne sympathies of the House to stand between tÃ¯Â¿Â½he wrongdoers and the vindication of outraged justice. (Cheers.) On a former occasion I saidI would e su port that Government, in case of war, which wold carry it on with the most manly bearing and b it to the best and most honourabl coDclusion.rf little thought when I made that address that the day was so near, that within three days afterwards we should learn that this country was at war. Yes, a great and most awful war, one of the most awful vwars in which we have ever been engaged. (Loud cheers.) We have got 40,000 men wearing tho Queen's uniform, drawing the Queen's bayonet, charging the Queen's guns. -I mean the Sepoys,-daring the forces of the Queen herself. (Cheers.) Do you suppose these Indian rebels have not been encouraged by what they have heard is going on here-that they have not heard of the feebleness, the imbecility, the cowardice that have distinguished a party here- a party which have shown favour to a set of tyrants? (Lord cheers.) I say they have, and that any man who belongs to the Peelite party is not the man wvho ought to be put forward by any constituency at the eve of a great and momentow English war. (Cheers.) As to my own opinuons on public questions, you hav heard them pretty freely expressed on many occasions. I only hope if you elect sn0 to Parliament I shall be able to obviatO the little diffieulty which bas been placarded against me-that I could not speak. (Laughter.) I ownI cannot speak very well, but I shall learn. (Laughter.) I cannot spin ouit glib sentences by the yard, as some people can; but if I have yot anythin g m my mind, if I feel strongly on any question, have, I believe, got brains enough to express it. When you send a man to the House of Commons yoa do not want hlis to be always talking; he goes there to conduct the business of the country; ho las to prepare himself on the question on which he proposes to speak before 65G members, who would bo bored if evoty man vrero to deliver his opinion. Ee nlust feel aad mider stand Vahit he is gOing tosay and r have not thelw 4toub that Sha beabletosayw ,icIfSel and thic i yoi vll' gF.e me the chance f aying it. (Cheers.) If every oneix the Honse of Commons talked All he thought upon every. thing, good God, what a Babel it would be ! Y;ou. eoul mot get on at all. (Cheerm.) On the first niight I came amoug you many questions wero put to me by a friend,, who capped them all by saying, Now, . Thakeray are you for the honour of Engand?' (Laughter.) I sas that that was rathor a wild and a wide question to put, but to the best of my belief I waa for the honour of England, and, would wotk for it;s to the best of my power. (Cheers.) About the baUot we arD-- al agreed. If I was for the ballot beforo Icause down here,. I am more for the ballot now. (Cheers.) AB to triennial Pa.- liaments, if the oonetitueiits desire them, I am for them. [A voice.-" Will you have the ballot to-morrow ?"I No, we are too manly, too plucky, too honest, and we will bealt them without it; but another day, when you have a better representation, We will have the ballot. (Cheers.) If yoi elect me, I shall not go to the House of Commons hostile. to the present Ministry, but determined to keep them tc their work and to prevent them from shrinking from any, of the promises they have madoe I think them in a warcriais eminently the best men to carry on the conrcils of the country, and to contend against the Tories and Peelites, who have very nearly paralyzed their arms. (Cheers.) In a crisis of war the Feelites are zot the mesn to whom the horour of England should be intrusted. (Cheers.) Gentlemen and electors, I thank you for your having given mue a hearing this day. I am perfectly confideat of the result of the poll to-morrow; if uen's promisen. are not piecrust, we know what the result will be. If it please youto return me, Iwill do my best to support thosepopular interest which may excellent friend Mr. Neate would have supported aith all his heart; and I will do my utmost to serve tho honest constitaency which has cordially offered me itg confidence. (Loud cheers.) A show of hands was then taken, which was deciared tobe in favour of Wr. Thackeray, when &poll was demandecon behalf of Air. CardwelL. The proceedings thea terminate! vwith a vote of thanks t% the mayor.
