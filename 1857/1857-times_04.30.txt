IRBLAND. (mOY OUR OWN OORMaOEDzS.) DUBLIN, WXDNMSDAY 1iO0RNMGn. A ROM" CATHOITC BIISHOP ASSAULTED BY HMS PLO, The Longford correspondent of Saunderi' Netesletter, in a letter dated Monday evening, relates what he fairly calls one of the most extraordinary circumstances that have occurred at least in the modern history of Ireland :- " The fact of a Roman Catholio Bishop having been waylaid and assaulted in his own diocess, and by members of his owrn flook, in the broad noonday, not for the purpose of robbery, but to chastise him for his political conduct during the late Longford election. Every effort was mnade by the priests to hush up the affair, in order to prevent scandal against ' Mother Church,' and it was therefore with the utmost difficulty I ascertained the facts of the case. Having accidentaly heard a hint or two dropped on the subject my curiosity was aroused, and by dint of great perseverance I succeeded in procuring the folowing circumstaces:-Early in the week the Rev. Dr. Kilduff, Roman Catholic Bishop of this dioceas IArdagh), while pursuing his usual clerical tour through his ttshoprio, was passing through thevillage of Newtownforbes (two niles from this town), when he was suddenly surrounded by a number of men, who stopped the car on which he sat, dragged him from his seat, and gave him verv rough handling, usmng the most violent epithets towards his Lordship,-such as 'Tne dirt han come through you,' Wbo sold Longford r I Where's White's moneyi' So the Bishop took the bribe !' These expressions were mingled with groans, hissea, and other marks of reprobation. One feUow went so far as to raise his brawny fist and make a terrible thrust at the rev, gentleman; he wsL, howOever, prevented from doing so by some respectable parties, who fortunately came up at the time, and, through almost forcible means, extricated the Bishop from his veryunenviable predicament. The rage of the mob having subsided, his Lordsbip was allowed to depart in peace. Some explanation as to the cause of this strange occurrence may be necesary. A 'Liberal club did exist in tbis town prevnous to the late election. This bodyw composed principally of Roman Catholic priests. At the diseolution of P.aliament this cdub met for the pnrpose of deciding u n the candidates to be put forward on the Radical side four offered themselves-the two ex-members and Colonel WVhite and Captain Forbes. The club decided that as Messrs. Hughes and Greville, their late representatives, had fulfiled their pledges, they could not pass them bv, and requested Caplaim Forbes to resign, which he did. They also promised that when a vacancy occorred he should be their man. Mr Hughes, perceiving some trickery on their reverenose' part, thought it better to retire from the oontest, Colonel White being in the field; and of course a vacancy took place, and an opportunity occurred of fulfilling their promise to Mr. Forbes. This they would not do; but, on the contrary, held a meeting, at which the Bishop presided, and passed a resolution that Colonel White-who would not identify himself with the club-and Colonel Greville were the men to represent the county. Newtownforbes is the property of the Barl of Granard, whose brother Captain Forbes is, and the people of that district were naturaUy exasperated at this line of conduct, and thus took an opportunity of evincing their feelings." SPRiNG OPERATIONS. The weather continues unfavourable, and com. plaints of the unusual backwardnesa of the season, the result of the unceasing rains for the whole of the last month, come from all quarters of the kingdom. The Belfast Mercantile Register thus reports of the northern diatricts " Serious apprehedsions are beginning to be felt regaling the weather, which, with the exoeption of a few days during the week before last, has been unusually severe and wet. Our advices from various parts of the country lead to the conclusion that spring sowing. except in the southern parts of the united kingdom, is fully three weeks later than usual, and that, owing to this circumstance, much of the land intended for cereals will be turned into pasture. Po. tatoes will be very late in putting into the ground, which is a serious matter, as one chief cause of the arrest of tho disease of late years has been their early planting. I some districts of the country sowing operations are later this season than they have been for the last 10 or 12 years Since yesterday the weather has been fine, but with a wintry temperature, and as yet there is little indication of any permanent improvement. Last night there was a sharp frost, with thick ice on the water in the morning, and there is every appearance of more to-night. Vegetation isBiU a forward state, but large districts of country are so situated that a week or two of flue weather is required to render the land fit for the reception of seed." The accounts from the south, although bad enough, are not, upon the whole, as cheerless as the precedng. A Clonnmel paper of yesterday says .- "This has been the wettest April remembered for many years, as out of the 28 days that have elapsed it has rained on 26. The agricultural operations throughout the country have been considerably retarded in oonsequence, and the sowing of oats and planting of potatoes are very backward, The young wheat crop looks healthy, althopgh some parties think it has received too much moisture. Yesterday was a beautiful spring day, anrl was a busy one throughont the country; but this morning there was some rin, and the weather again looks unsettled." A letter from Westmeath gives a most unsatisfactor report of the state of the crops in that county, an mn the western province generally : "For many years a spring equally backward to the present in all the agricultural departments has not been known. Having had occasion during the last fortnight to travel through a very large portion of the country, I might venture to state that fully 50 per cert. of the land prepared for oats remains at the present date (April 27) without having received a single rain of seed; ind as to the potato crop, the land, although exhibiting all the appear ance of preparation, remains unplanted, owin to the extreme softnessof the soil, which precludes the poesibility of carting out manure. Having just returned from visiting a considerable portion of the conty of Roscommon and a smal portion of Longford, I must add that in the former county things are still worse; in fact, to use the words of an inteligent farmer,-' Suoh a stte of thins was never before known; every place is infloods;not tE least thing doing; thechiefporhon oftheoats isunsown, and as for any other crops, they are and must be, as long as the present weather continues, neglected.' My informant, in addition to the discouraments which he described, had just sustained the loss of eeral head of horsed cattle by distemper, which, I am sorry to asy, Is at prsent causing serious injury to many farmers, both in oscominon aud Westmeath. The prospect of fine weather just now appearing is, unde: such circumstances, most cheering, and no doubt farmers will avail themselves of it with all possible alacrity." THIE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

(BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.) DUBLIN, WEDNySDAY EvXNING. THE TIPPERARY BANK. The Lord Ohancellor gave judgment to-day in the appeal from the decision of the Master of the Rolls, by which MIr. Vincent Scully was held liable as one of the contributories to the Tipperary Bank, notwithstanding the transfer of his shares to a third party. The Chancellor, after stating his reasons for dissenting from the decision of the Master of the Rolls, said he did not consider that MIr.

Henley, in hi letter to 2%e Times of Saturday last, ventures to express an opinion that mny pl*ns forsubmarine cables will not be found practicable, and asigns as reason, that " the lapping of the coil round the break.drum vwould be suffident to cause the iron core to cut through the indiarubber," &c. L Mr. Henley bad takea the trouble to make himself master of the subject before addressing you, Sir, his opinion might have been offered with greater diffidence and proved of more value. In the frast place, no break-drum will be used in laying my new submarine conductors, and they are so light and easily handled that no abrasion whatever need occur in paying them out. Wherever they are subject to the action of waves upon a rocky bottom-and this is only inshore,-they are properly potected. Notwithstanding the "opinions" of such gentlemen as Mr. Henley and r. Charles Bright, these submarine conductors have received the approval of the highest engineering talent in this country and in France, and are pronounced to be the best and cheapest hitherto invented. From persons who are pledged to, and interested in the expensive cable in process of manufacture for the Atlantic Telegraph Companly, I do not expect an unbinssed jud'nent, but those who profess themselves disinterested will, 'oI hope, inspect and understand muy patents before they offer " opinions" upon their merits, I am, Sir, your very obedient servant TrHOMAS ALLAN. 1, Adelphi-terrace, Stlrand.

THE NORTEHERN BELLE. The following despatch has been received by Lord Clarendon from Mr. Dalla with reference to the loes of the Northern Belle:- " The United States' Minister at til Court of St. James'd has the honour to transmit to the Earlof Clarendon, &c.. 21 slver medals and a bill of exchauge for 2701. sterling, and to request that his Lordship will be pleaed to cause these testimonials to be delivered to the brave individuals for whom they are intended by the President of the United States in-acknowledgment of the services rendered in saving the lives of the crew of the American ship Northern Belle. " The incidents counected 'with the fate of this vessel ocourred too recently and too close to the British coast, creating too universal and deep a sensation, to render their detailed repetition at all necessary on this occasion. It will, liowever, be recollectedby his Lordship, that after perform. ing her voyage acrosi the Atlantic from New York, and While approacbing the port of her destination, London, the Northern Belle, of 1,100 tons burden, on the oth .oz January last encoulntered a gale of unusual violence, and was obliged to anchor off Kingsgate at less than a mile'a distance from the shore. She rode heavily, and the sea occasionally broke completely over her. Her main and mizen masts were cut away. The fury of the storm increased, and raged during the whole of the day, rendering vain every effort at assistance, and engulphing a Margate lugger that attempted it. The ship parted from her anchors at midnight, and, a prey to the tempest, drove, amid darkness, hail, sleet, and suoOW, upon the rocks beneath the cliff. Her crew, 23 in number, lashed themselves to the rigging of the only rmaining mas, strggled through the horrors of the night, nd were discovered from the beach at early daWn. Gallant and human exertions were at once made to recue them from their desperate condition. One lifeboat, manned by 10 brave men, pulled through a boiling surf at imminent peril, rched the wreck, and retuAed to shore with seven of the sufferers. A second lifeboat, emulating the daring advonture, brought 14 others safely to land, and linally, though long thwarted by their determi. nation to perish rather than to leave the Northern Belle, the same means redeemed tne captain and the pilot from impending death. "These aretheleading features, s reported tohis Govern ment by the Consul of the United States in London, of the series of successful acts of courage and humanity which it is the desire of the President to mark by tokens of Ameri¢an gratitude and thilns. The undersined hs thereforo been specily instructed to lay before the Earl of Claendon the list, ccompanying this letter, of those truly heroio spirits who nanned the lifeboats, and to beg that hisIordship will cause each indlividual therein mentioned to be presnted with the silver medal inscnbed to him, -ad also, from the amount of the bisl of exchange, with the sum stated oppo. site his name (augmented according to the number of risks incurred), in evidence of the high appreiation and acknowledgment of their conduct by the Government and people of the United Stateg.

THE OOLLIBBY ZXILOSIOR ATLUNDHILL. LUDHUZ4 Wm)NLISDAy; The great falls of roof which have been encountered have prevented the work of exhumation from being so speedily carried out as was generdly expeoted. Up-to Mondaynight only nine bodies had been recovered, the last having been brought out on Thursday morning, the 23d inst At an early hour on Tuesday morning the men, while at work close to the bottom of the cupola, or upoast shaft, wbere the fire bad raged so fearfully, found a body, and, as might be exyeced, from the exposed situation in which it wa plac, it was in a dreadfuly burnt and mutiated utate, and there being not theraostremotechanoeof its being identified, it was buried on Tuesday afternoon in rfeld Churchyard. Two other bodies were found during Tuese day, one of them that of a boy who it was thorght might possibly be recognied, as it waa not so decomposed and burnt ag the others. At 8 o'clock this morning the party at work in the south level having penetrated nearly to its extremity, about 500 yards, met with the body of a stout man, which was more perfect and in a better state of preservation thin thosebitherto brought out. It was thought that he was one of the family of Kellett, of which seven members were in the pit at the time it was closed. Up to 3 o'clock this afternoon however, none of the bodies had been identified, and two oi them are to be interred this evening, and, not having been identified, of course without being viewed by the coroner and jury The coroner has given directions to Mr. Superintendent Green, of Barnsley, that whenever one two or more bodies shaU be recovered which can be cleariy ang distinctly identified notioe shall at once be given to him (the coroner) to that effect, that the jury may be su-mmoned to view them ; but, with regard to the remamder of the bodies, the coroner has ven directions that they shall be interred without needlees elay. The jury will therefore only once more be summoned to view a few of the bodies, and all the rest will be interred as they are recovered with all convenient desjatch, whether they can be identified or not. In the north levels, where the roof has givenway so mueh, and in the workings leading from which a oonsiderable number of men were employed, great exertions are being made to clear away the vast accumulation of fallen materials. When this has been accomplished, Ma it shortly will be, an exploration of the workings will be made, and the recovery of the bodies wll proceed with greater rapidity. On Tuesday Mr. Sadler, jun., one of the medical gentlemen connected with the colliery descended and made an examination of it. He roportd? it to be quite free from anything of an injurions tendency, the stream of pure air as well as the disinfectants used being fnUy sufficient to neutralize the effects of any noxious effluvia which may be emitted by the bodies. A meeting of engineers was held this day (Wednesday) at the offices of the colliery, but was only attended by Messrs. Woodhouse and Holt. The Government Inspector, Mr. Morton, was present during the deliberations of the above gentlemen. The report of the managing committee was received and approval given to what they bad done. The subscriptions in aid of the sufferers up to the present time exceed 9,0001., and as the committee are desirous that the amounit subscribed shall in no way exonerate the ratepayers of the district from their jutst liabilities, a correspondence has taken place between the secretaries to the fund and the Poor Law Board. The subject hag also been noticed by the board of guardians, some of the members of which thought that the relief given from the fund ought to be a bar to parochial relief. In order to set themselves right with the public, the committee have issued the following statement of what was done at the accident at the Oaks Colliery in 1847, which will form some guide on the present occasion in the distribution of the fund raised for the sufferers in the late accident:- " In order to inspie coDnfidence in the subscribers to the 'LundhlU Colliery Pund,' the committee beg to submit the folowing statement of lwbat was done on the occasion of a similar calamity which occurred at the Oaks Colliery on the 5th of March, 1847, when 73 hlves fell a sacrifice.

HUDSON vermus BOYAL BARK OF AUSTPALIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T1ES. Sir,-A-S in ou report of this case the puLblication cz parte of the statements to the effect that I had, without authority, negotiated debentures of the company intrusted for sale to the firm of B. and x Boyd, as their appointed brokers, is calculated to do me great, though, I am sure, unintentional, injury, may I beg the favour of your giving thisxmy unqualified contradiction to such assertion? " It vas contended at the trial as stated by Lord Camp bell, that the Boyds were creditors of the bank, and if that had been the case Mark Boyd would- have had a right of action on the note, and he could have transferred it to the I take my stand, therefore, on the fact that the amount due, and to be accounted for, to the estate of B. and M. Boyd from the Royal Bank of Austraia isupwards of 37,WOO.; and I further solemnly declare that I never in the course of my connexion with this unfortunate company, nor indeed in the whole course of my career, sold a security for which I had not paid the uttermost farthing ; in confir. mntion of which I may be permitted to draw attention ,to the fact that the same allegation-when made on a previous occasion, on which I had the opportunity (which I had not in the presentcease, not being a party to the suit} of nindicating my own course of conduct-received at the hands of my counsel the most signal refutation, founded on a reference both to the book of B. and i. Boyd and to those of the Royal Bank of Austraia, and was afterwards abandoned on the part of those at whose instance it was mooted. So much for the facts; and, with reference to the legal view of the case by which I was guided, I can only sy I derived it from an eminent member of the bar, one of Her Majesty's counsel, whose opinion I sought, the sme advioa having been previously imparted to me by my own solicitor, a nnan second to none in eminence in the rofeesion. Apologizing for the length at which Ihave been obliged to trespass on your attention, I have the honour to remam, Sit. Your most obedient Pervant MARK BOYD. T:okenDoUse-yatd, April 29.
COURT OF BANKRUP TO, Diq-, Apri~ 29. IN RE ROYAL BRITISE BAWK. (Before Mr. Cornmfuonr Hoi.mwn. Thiz Ws a meeting for the exanination of Mr. Humphry Brown, one of the directors of the bank. Mr. Inlklater appeared for the assignees, undMr. Greville for Mr. Brown. hr. Wyld, M2.-Perhaps your Honour wl allow in to address a word to you with reference to some observations which were made to yon by 1r. Coryton, wrho professed to repre3ent a large body of the deponitors of the Royal British Bank. He seemed to stato that the invetigation whiclh is noW taking place was againgt the wishes Of A lrg Majority of the body of depositors. Now, Sir, the assignees and a large body of the depositors think it due to themselves, and also due to Mr. Linklater, to stte that they think they wouid not be pursaing a public duty and the requiremeuts of public justice, or what the nature of this peculiar fraud requires, if they had not parsued before your Honour the investigation which has oceupied your flme to so great a length; and in doing so thoy Must sate that Mr. Linklater his given to them in amount of asdstance and an amount of investigation, and of his time, which they feel nothing but his sense of nublic duty would Lave allowed him to do; and they feel also-both the as. tignees and a large body of depositor-that they ove him a debt of gratitude, snd they have desired me to exprems in open Cor to you that they do not at all paticipate inthe expressons of Ir. Coryton; they fel in this matter,as in the matter of the composition which M1r. Linklater has most kdndly taken upon himself-labourint till very often past midnight In en eavouring to effect some arrangement betweenthedepositors andeaholders-thathehas beenaotuated by no profesional or peuniay feeling, but to inves. tigate, ifposible, thisgreat calamity, andto do allinhispower to effect an arrangement between the shreholders. and depositors; and therefore they do not participate at alLin the rem rks mide by Er. Corvton, but they beg, throu5h me, to express their entiro senie of the necesity of this investigation beforo you, and also their thanks to Mr. Link. lxter for his greatprofessiona kindness both to them &nd to the estte. Mr. MaxwelL-Sir, as another of the aignees in thls matter, I have appeared here to-day to confirm all that Mr. Wyld hu said to you, and also to call the attention of those depositors who do not give this matter the anxious consideration and attention we have been obliged to give to the fact that they owe a debt of gratitude to the investigptor on the wvrongdoing in this fraud of the RBoyal British Bank-to Mr. ikter's unaided and volun. tary efforts in the first instance; ioi. had itnot beenfor the manliness whieh prompted him in the first instance to interfere on their behalf the creditors to this hour would have had no earthly triiunal whatever before which they could interrogate those who have brought so much wrong d .n miser upon them. I have watched the whole of theee airs, being obliged to do so by raon of the very heavy stake I had in the affair, and I can most conseientionaly decl here that never before perhaps, in the world's history was so much dsintereetedness brought to beer upon So oompliUated a cse as Mr. Linklater hsz brought to bear upon the conduct of this cae. (Applause.) I can say that when he h no other aid but tat which his own reason gave him, and no other help than his own pocket afforded, he came forrard to save us from entombment in the Court of Chancery, and be gave us an open court and a willing, kind, and patient ud, a who has devoted everything that could be eecte in ibe shape of attention and care to one OI the most compliesated and roost extensively proseouted frauds that has ever disgraced the commercia hstory of the age in which we live. The public at large have a deep interest as well as the depositors in this eas The public, through its organ, the publio press, have most readily seized and pubished every exposure that ha3 taken place in this court, and the pnblio feel, as well as the depositors, that innocent and confiding people will hereafter rejoice that this oourt was open to the dopcsitors in this bank, and that they have found a man icufflently able and willing to devote himelf to the exposures which hereafter will save hundreds and thousands of confiding people from the wrong and misery and ruin which knaves and rogues, whether directors, or otherwise named, were only too willing and too prompt to bring upon them. The CObtass9oNML-I think we had better proceed with the buiness of to-day. As to the proceedings being at all unnccessar~ or as to their naot bez desired by the great body of shar-eholders or creditors-whether that be so oF not, it is the duty which has been imposed npon the Court by Act of Parliament, and of course the assngnees are the persons whiose duty it is to bring this matter before the Court. Mr. Wyld.-We are sapported by a great bod of the depositors; but we felt that we ahould not be fulfilling a puDllic duty if we did not with your kind ermison, pur sue this investigation to the utmost extent o our power Mr. Brown, examined, said. he became sX director on the 4th of February, 1853. It became necessary that he should be the holder of ten shares of 50. each. He gave his note-of-hand for the amount (5001.) He bought the shares of Mr. Mulllin, through MYr. Cameron. He paid for the shares in no other way than by his promisor note that note had not been, paid. It was afterward agreedthat each director should have 20 shares. He then agreed to Purchase ten more shares from Cameron, but he never puad for those shares. He then gave Cameron a pro. misorynote for 1,000L instead of 5001. He (Mr. Brown) had never paid Is. on account of that 1,0001. Soon after becominf a director he opened an acconnt with the bank (in hlarch, 853) Mr.I i ATER.-As you became a director in 1853 I presume you opened an important account to the bank. flow much did you pay in to the credit of the bank; wasit so large a sum as 1l. 14s. ? Mr. Brown.-That was the first item. And on the same day that you paid that in did you do them the honour to borrow upon your note-of-hand 2,0001. ? I did. Security was contemplated on a vessel worth 7,0001., but that security was not completed until Juns, 1853. Could not tell whether that prominssory note for 2,0001. weat before the board for disconunt. He never sat on any finance oommittee when advances were made to him, and he had not been In the habit of getting his bills discounted at the bank before he became a director. Had not given any bills before that time. Mr. LaxE kvxr.-How came you to allow yourself to become one of the directors of the Royal British Bank ? Mr. Brown.-Thst is a question that I have very often asked myself. I will tell you without any difficulty. I ot connected with one or two companies in which Mr. Mulling was the solicitor. I looked upon him as a very respectable man, and having been .onnected with these companies, I w-s asked by Mr. Mullins to join the Royal British Bank, I consented to do so with Sir John Shelley, who was then a co-director in one of those yompanies, and unfortunately I did join them, and Sir John Shelley afterwards declined. - I think you were a director in several compnies of which persons who were directors in the Royal British Bank were also directors ?-I was, A great many companies, I think ?-Only three. Was not one the Chartered Australan Importing ani | Pefining Company?-Yes. And the Patent Waterproof Brick and Tile and Common Brick and Tile Company ?-lfo. Did anybody put you at the bead of the list of directors by mistake for anybody else ?-Yes, they did put me at the head of that list. I was ill at the tima, and I wrote toXlr Mulling, and said if it was not withdraw I should send a letter to The Times. You never had anything to do -with it 7-I never had except to go to the office when I got well, and complain of their making use of my name. But the Wandle Waterworks Company you were a director of ?-I was a director of that. You were a director of a dock company ?-I was - but I declined the dock company after I had been to the first meeting. It was not respectable enough. The Chartered Australian Land, Mining, and Importing Refining Company?-I was a director of that; but I shot'd explain with regard to the Wandle Waterworks Company; it is only just to myself to do so. I found On joining that, although the list of subscribers included eminent names, as the Gurneys, to a very large amount, and other men almost as opulent-I found they had never paid is. on their shares. Mr. Esdaile and myself paid the money to get them out of debt. I paid 1,5001. at one time. Those are not all the companies with which you were connected ?-I believe they are. Was there not one for making deal boards out of sawdust? (Lan ghter.)-No. MWat has become of all those companies? Are they defunct, or are they not ?-They are defunct so far as this,that I bave had to pay a very large sum of money to rid them of their obligations. Those companies were a very serious loss to me in every respect. Examination continued.-On the 12th of March he obtained an advance of 3,000?., and on the 2d of May he borrowed 4,0001., making altogether 9,000K At this time he paid into the bank 2,0001. Mr. LINKLATsR-There is no such 2,0001. to your credit. Mr. Brown.-Prior to a certain date I had arranged with Mr. Cameron to give security over the Helen Lindsay worth more than 9,000?. Mr. Brown proceeded to state that his business transactions had amounted to 500,000. He should have been surprised if Mr. Cameron had refused to let him have 2,0001. without security. Mr. Cameron kne Mhim to be a man of considerable property. Mr. L NKLA'rxn.-H. yyou bee` an old acquaintance of Cameron ?-I had not. How long had you known Cameron before you became a director of the bank? Mr. Brown.-Two or three weeks; not niore. A letter was here read, of which the following is a copy:- "Ral British Bank, 16, Tokenhonse-yard, Lothoury, London, May 4, I55. My dear Sir, - In consideration of your discounting my promissory note on the Royal British Bank for £P400, at six mouths, and placing the ame to my credit In aeeoamtwith tho bank, Inudertake and pledge mlYsef, on 4# hours'notice aLt any time, to repa-y youa the said gum, or. depoit with the bank. wilth ibne essry menmorandmsid ah r deeds, and real property beongingR to me worth much morethnti' s t Yours utins eHUMPReB Y BROWN. H I L Cameron, Esq., Royal British Bank, Lothbury." It wai MIr. Cameron's duty to place that letter before the board. re had no idea that Mr. Cameron had completed the transaction to which it referred without the anction of the board. It would have been absurd to inquire if he had done so. On the 16th of June he borrowed 7,000?. As security for that he gave a bill of aleover a vesel called tbe Helen Lindsay. Mr. Cameron had at that time written a letter gtviag directions for the renewal of the bills for 00 . for six monthis, and there was an understanding that the sale of the Helen Lindsay should not be registered. Heo had subsiequently written the following letter: n pts ut¢ R 5 h 3~~Setebe 1ti h 15 in -tie.

Mr. Lnm2 A.TER.-If be hd been a pradent mm you say that would have been the course? Mr. Brown.-I cannot give you a better reason than I did before. The circamshnces were these:-Very soon {fter I joined the bank I found the soLcitor of the bank and governor of the bank and others made -se of their power to go to the bank oounter and -discount their paper. Iatde a complaint of it to the board and to the mansger, and I told them I wouldinsist upon such a sytem being put a stopto, and it was. A resolution was come to, though ther wano Potive order given, that a director should not receive anv on from the bank, except it came thogh the gener~i manager. Mr. ILneri&mz-You we a more prudent mn thau the general manaer, thent MIr. Brown.-rdo not know that I was.

Heodid not know that Mr. Walton deposited those securties with the bankh nor did he know that Mr. Walton's account at the benk wa so large as it W. He (Mr. Brown) had had large tranadtions with Mr. Walton. In May the bank discounted his draughts on Walton. The bank had no security for those discounts, nor did the bank hold any security for the 7,000L originallyadvanced. He pve the scurity aS a general security for the whole of hk debt Mr. Lynxra.v .-0f these securities the bank really held nothing- Examination oontinued.-About this time he addressed the letterproduced to Cameron, rewuosting that Mlr. Miould's bill for 4,000 might be renewred. That amount wau renewed. Upto the present time the bsnk had not beenpui so much as a hilling on account of that 4,0001L, but he bolieved they would be paid. Mr. Moulld was a contractor, in a large way of busines. Something occurred about this time which caused him to remarlc upon the Bank's sysWem of book-keeping and making advances and he wa always told' at the bank tht it ws the Scotch ystem. (Great laughter.) '- . : Mr. Brown troceeded to state thatthe bills diseountod at this time b, t e bank were good bilhs, such as the bank of England an other banfIing complanies wouild take. On the 4th of September, 1854, he became liable to the ban2 for bills disoounted to ths amount of upiards of 22,0004. At that time he gtve security on several vesse. Mr. LnevirxR here proceeded to quote from the mort. gages, and to show th4t Mr. Brown had made no mention of the previous mortge of the vesels to Walton for 10,0009., and referred to a deed executed by the bakrupt. The CmnaroNma-I observe that deed does mot pro. pose to cancel the imortga to Walton.- Mr. Brown.-On the 25th of Febrary, 1854, a mortage was made from me to Mr. Walton of the Helen indsay, the M dalens, and the Hero. lr. LELATxr.-For 10,00M ? Mr. Brown.-To oover 10,00W.

Mr. iI.-Bam-But in the meantime they had been mortgaged for another amount of 10,000& to Mr. Walton ? Mr. Brown.-They were left subject to a 10,0001. mort. ~ageto Mr. Walton; the bank took them, subject to that ,iu.mortgge. The ConnSIoNxmt-No; yon, gave theni to the bank subj'ect to one mortigace in Feboruary, whichx wasa in ortgao of 10,0001. to Mr. Walton, but you subsequnl otae them for 10,0001. more to Walton in Anukst. Mr. LS-rjaTzxu.-On the Helen Lindsay. Now, lMr. Brown. was the mortgage to the bank for 15,000D. of these three ships subject to t4e mortgage to Walton of the 25th of February, 154? Mr. Brown.-Quite so. Mr. LInaxhi-Not one word is mentioned in that mortgage of the 4th of September, 1854, which you had executed to the governor of the Royal British Bank Mr. Walton, upon the Helen Lindsay of 10,000l., and upon her freight for 10,0001 Mr. Brow-.-3r. Walton stood in this relationship-He was governor of the bank; there were various transfers made, one of which I wiU explan diy. Mr. LU UATm-But do you not know that br. Walton had deposited with the bank to secure a portion of his own debt of the 29th of November, 1854 that mortgag! of February, 1854? Mr. Brown-No, I do not. Mr. LeIMA.Tm-Do you think that the arrangement was that those mortgages should not be registered ? Mr. Brown.-Yes; not of the large ships. Mr. LrKLA.TzX -I mean of the Glocester ships. Mr. Brown. -Yes. Mr. LINL&TER.-I think you told the solicitor of the bank that you did not wish them registered, and would speak to the direotors upon the subiect. Mfr. Brown.-I did not do an g of the sort. I told the solicitor of the board I would not have them registered. I told him that I would not even give thom as a temporary security if they were registered, Mr. LThnLATxR.-Did you, on the 29th of November, 1854, sign an undertaking to register the Glocester ships upon their return to Engltnd? Mr. Brown.-! did. Me morandum here read containing the following pay. Memorandum.- I, HnmpheryBrewnof Tew}esbury, ihe county Glocester, member of Parlament hais executed a mortgage to the Rnyal British Sank of thi ships mentioned in the underwritten echoduls. whieh saud hare particularlydeibein thesaid indenture of mortgagep ud, whereac the said ships are severaly registered in the ports spechile in the said schedule, and it i, thought oxpedient that they shoald be registered in the porc of Loudon, and tfh said ship seinz unow absen on voyages to diffrent parts or the world, I, tho said Eumuphery Browin, do hereby undertak duly to register the said sps dennvo iU the port of London immeiately atter their respective return to the united kingdom front their said several voyage. As witneesmyhand thle29thday of Ncvember, IBM." The scheaule above referred to consisted of the M. R. White, Wiscasset, State of Maine (U. S.)- the Young Marquis, Glocester; the Wasp, Glocoster- the Madonna, Glocester; the Bride, Glocester, and waa signed " Hunphrey Brown." Examnination continned.-At this time he undertook that five vesselz on their way from America and elsewnere should be registered on their return, On the 4th of September, 1854, his liabilities, directly and indirectly, amounted to about 30,0001. lIe should say that the mnajority of the bills (28,0001.) then held by the bank had since been paid. He should be surprised to hear that the amotunt so paid was only about 2,000. He became familiar with the name of Oliver, of Liverpool, in October, 1854, and that he was then indebted to the bank. He was present at a meetig of the Board of Directors on the 24th of October, 1854, at which the minute of the 17th of October was read as to Mr. Do Wolfe attending at the court. Mr. LTI ATER.-You became awre in October, 1854, that Oliver had failed, and mr. Eadaile told us that it was decided there would be a loss of some thousands to the bank? Mr. Browon.-Not then. Mr. ILrutTEBn.-When did you first apprehend a loss by Ohver of some thousands? Mr. Brown.-That must have been some time afterwards. - I should think in February, 1855. I have no hesitation in saying Oliver swindled the bank out of 20,000t.; it is a very strong term to use, but I have no doubt about its correctness. Mlr. Oliver had taken bills to the bank, and told them that the transaction was not cnly perfeetly afe, but very profitable. Mr. Oliver obtainedl the bank drauxghts at 60 days' sight for, them to be sent to Asiserica to mnee his engagements, he telling the bnsk that from their being 60 days' sight bills they would get at-least six months' interesti upon the bills. The very day this was taking place in the bank parlour, and whito an angry discussion was then going on, go,neof-thota:biwlswetocbPiugtlt 'Int the bank for theb bank's acceptance, and Mr. Oliver was found to hate dis- counted those bills in every direetion, wherever he could,. both in London and LiverpooL That is the trasction with respect to Oliver. Mr. ITnErBn.-By wkom was Oliver introduced to the bank I Mr. Brownn-I cannot say of my own knowledge, but I think he was introduosd by the governor, Mr. Walton. I think it is only right to say, also, that on a diswussion taking place the next day before nyself and, I think, Mr. Esdaile Mr. Walton agreed that he bad done what was irregular, and Mr. Walton himelf hanaea over tothe bank a security, which wo thought would be worth 8,0901., as eollateral secnrity, and of which, in reality, we did realise one-half. 3r. Walton was not lpally liable for une shilling od that; he as morally liable, and he was bank two bills of 4.0l~ each, not his own bills, but the bilsO of Oliver, which had come ini his hands from Oliver. - Zlr.

Sir,-As I am informod that the reportof the proceedings. herein, containedain your impression of yesterday's date, has been misconstrued by some of your readers, I shall feet obliged by your insrting these few lines to assure them that the transactions in question were entered into without my knowledge or concurrence, and that I was entirely ignorant even of the existence of the account referred to and in which I appear to be debited with the sum of 8,7521. 6e. 5d., until a few days before the stoppage of the bank, vwhen I immediatelyrepudiatedit and requested the directors to have it struck out of their books I need therefore sarcely add that I never received a single shilling of the amount, although your leading rtiole of to-day seems to assume that I sm indebted to the full extent of it. I am. Sip. nsour H1. EMPSON. 61, XoorgatorSeet Arl ff . TO THEB EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Inyourreportof the proceedings of my examiniMion in the Court of Baakptcy on Monday it is 2hade to appear that Mr. Stapleton did not dissent to the balance-sheet and report. Such was not mny desire to appear, and I take this opportunity of correcting the effect of the statement. Oa Mr. Stapleton's former examination he has stated th&t " he proposed a call of 25. per hare, and objected to the payment of a dividend." This statement I corroborated at the time before the Commisioner, when pressed by Mr. Linklater to admit t.hat Mr. Stapleton had "yielded." I would still wiah it to be understood that he rather yielded to the opinions of others from force of numbers than, as far as I could judge, from any altered conviction of his own. It has never been my aim to implicate others to screen myself, as my own evidence tends entirely to my conscious. ness of my Own culpability. I am. Sir. vour obelnt s TmOS.CRUXD.
THE EMIGPAN2B BY THB BOANRBBGE TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I havo seen the explanatory letters In The 1mW respecting those emigrants on whose behalf I addressed to you the statement which has been so generously reWonded to. In that statement no refleetion was made nor implied on any individual or body. I am thankful that the commissioners can ssure the public that emigrants, circumstanced so pecularly and trymgly as the paSSengers of the Boanerges, are provided not only with necesssaries but with those comforts which their exhausted state requires - and I am glad to bear my testimony to the way in which the surgeon superintendents are generally spoken of in the may letters which I have received from emigrants. But those who know how scantily provided the poor are under any circumstances must be well aware that, under those in which these poor people have been placed, they are not so supplied as to render unnecessary that help wich, though loeral in the donor, 'will become a small pittance when divided among so many. I shall therefore apply, ander proper advice, on the spot 'what has been so generously entrusted to my care. Believe me. vsour faithful ssvsn "W. WELDON CBILIPNEYS. ±ectory, w hitcchapcl, April 2g.

JCOYAL ASYr.uM OF THE ST. Ai'S SOCIETY.- The 152d anniversary of this institution (the object of which is the clothing, maintenance, and education of the children of once prosperous parents, orphans or not, of any nation) was celebrated by a dinner last evening at the London Tavern. The Duke of Wellington presided, in the absence of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, who was prevented from attending by the alarming illness of her Royal High. ness tbe Duchess of Glocester. Among those who occupied seats in the immediate vicini of the chair were the Riajah of Coorg, Meer AlU Moorad KBan Bahadoor, Hyder Jng Bahadoor, (who were arrayed in their gorgeous orienta robes), Lord Ashley, Mr. J. Greene, XP., Mr. Platt, MP., Mr.Tarner, M.P., Mr.Roupell, M.P., Mr.Townshend, lP., Dr. Livingston, the African misionay, Sheriffs Mechi and Keats, Rev. Dr. Croly, Rev. Dr. Bellow, and several military gentlemen, including Colonel Rowland, Captain Lee, Major Boileau, andColonel Dawson. Covers were laid for 250 gentlemen, and about 150 ladlies, who occupied seats in the gallery and upon a platform at the rear of the chair, increased the brilanoy of the scene. The band of the Coldstream Guards played at intervals during the dinner, under the direction of Mr. Godfrey, and a party of eminent vocalists, under the direction of Ir. George Geznge, also contributed to the evening's entertainment. After the company had heartily responded tothe customaryloyal toasts. 100 of thechildren, male andfemale, whoarobein broughtup under the auspices of the institution, were introIuced to the notice of the company, and elicited admiration by their healthy, happy, and intelligent appearance. A very appropriate address in behalf of the institution, (verse composed by Mr.Miles,) waa excellently delivered by one of the pupils named James Barnesley, aged 13 years. The toast of the evening wras then proposed, and we may here observo that the Streatbam Asyium of the Society was erected in 1829 for the accommodatAon of a matron, a master, one mistrese, 100 boys, and 50 girlb, but dnce that period the number of children in thoAsylumbas beeninozeedto238,andit became necessary to make the accommodatlion correspond with that increase. The building was accordingly enlarged, at an expense of 4,000b, towards which only 1,0001. of the present funds of the society are available. That enlargement, however, does not extend to the schoolrooms, as it was deemed advisable in the first instance to increase the dormitories, lavatories, &o. lUnder these circumstances, the committee appeal very justly to the public for the funds necessary to complete their itable undertakin. The society from its commencement has provided for 2,000 children. The number of children now in its town school are 62, and in its country asylum 238. The average number of candidates approved by the committee at each half-yearly election is 90, of which the society is only able to elect 15. The noble Chairman earnestly advocated the claims of the institution, and his appeal was responded to by a liberal subscription (1,500Z.). We are happy to say that the indefatigable efforts of I.. Leeks, the secretary, to give 6clat to this year's anniversary were crowned with succss. The office of toastmaster was effioiently flled by Mlr. Harker. SuPiPRsSIox OF "o SAUr" HnuNoS.-An effort is being made by many clergymen and gentlemen in Lincolnahire, at the head of whom is the bishop of the diooess to put a stop to the prctice of hiring agricultural an& domestic servants at "s tatutes or fairs, generaly held at about the present time of the year. On these occasions great numbers of servants assemble at a market-town, and stand in some publie place during the greater pazt of the day for the purpose of obtaining an engagement in service for the ensuing year. Throughout the day, and especiaUy In the evening, they flock into the neighbouring publichouses, where eating and drinling and dancing are kept up incessantly, and excess and sensuality prevail to a most demoraliziDg extent. The farmers and those best acquainted with this objectionable sysem have long acknowledged the evils to which it gives rise, but they have hitherto failed in applying a remedy to it, owring to the wnt of that organized effort which it is to behoped wiji now be made for the purpose under tho auspices of the bishop nd clerg of the

ZO&DOZ, THUBSDAY, APRIL 30, 1857. To-day a hundred and seventy private gentlemen are expected fromn the country on a smddell and unusual summons. We might poaibly answer some purpose or other by explaining, cstirely to our own-, satisfaction, what- they are coming- for, who has sent for them, and the ocaion of this .apparently unaIled-fosr iaterruption to their private affairs, There are those who havo the clearest views on these points, and who are equally prepared to tell these gentlemen exactly what they are, and what they are likely to do. We must own ourselves to some uncertainty on all these points; but not to aik, at this time of day, who compelled the Dissolution, and why they did ao, we will confine ourselves to the present and practical part of the inquiry. These hundred. aud seventy gentlemen are generally sid to be men of more local importance than political distinction. They are sons of country gentlemen, successfil manufacturers, men recently come to propertyl, some literary gentlemen and lawyers who hsve not gone through the Parliamentary ordeal, and quite the usual proportion of scions of nobility. Indeed, looking to the whole, the new ingredients are very like the old, the only difference being that between novices and old hands. We observe some ingenious attempts in pro- gress to persuade these hundred and seventy that,. being without importance, experience, ability, or name, they had better look out for leaders with those requisites. Every shipload of emigrants landing on the quays of New York is surrounded by the touters of hotels and railways and speculators in land. Our own political adventurerz are equally alive to the emergency of so extensive an arrival, and their agents are everywhere whispering " sound advice" and seductive persuasions. fleere is the old established firm of STANDsTsLT,, Do.NOUNnG, GR&BALR, and Co., recommending locations in a fine, comfortable, long-settled country, towns built, roads made, everything done for you, rather expensive at first, but paying in the end. On the other side, Messrs. PEAACE, PUY, and PnosPrzTy are empowered to sell on very easy terms an extensive and fertile section of prairie land, deep virgin soil, dead level, ana fine water and railway communication to all parts of the world. Meanwhile, the agent of another firm is wasting stentorian lungs and a Niagara of words in setting forth the merits of a happy family established somewhere in a secluded vaUey, all peace and fellowship, no rates or taxes, and everything as different as possible from the rest of the world. The hundred and seventy politicel immigrants will probably judge fgr themselves They comprise every variety of character and cireumstances ; but, just as no amount of friendly caution has yet sufficed to save the veritable immigrant from the rogues who lie in wait for his purse on the quays of New York, we have not the least doubt that the usual average of these hundred and seventy will be swindled by one impostor or another out of all their political belongings. It would, however, be a calumny on the British people to expect a large proportion of ready dupes in so numerous a body. On the contrary, we believe a large proportion to be practical men, and selected on that ground. Indeed, it is made a matter of serious complaint that there are now very few men returned to Parliament of what may be called a speculative value,-.young men of birth andeaucation, admired and loved by a family, a circle, or a patron, but otherwise unknown, undeveloped, undirected, and waiting for their call. People now prefer sending fullgrown trees instead of political nurslings; and the trees are too generally, it is said, stunted, warped, twisted, or otherwise misgrown. A man may do very well where he is, as a county magistrate, a merchant, or some other local or professional thing, without, however, being able to adapt himself to the demands of political life. Such, then, it is alleged, are many of the men just infused into the I:ouse of Commons. But men of this quality will have an eye rather to actual business than to pompous displays and party demonstrations. They will not listen to every political MADIAn who ascends "the stomp" and declaims for a couple of hours about the high principles and the noble sentiments monopolized by himself and two or three hungry claqueurs. They will not yield themselves up to the enjoyment of vast empty platitudes, from whatever side they may be invited. They will sspect men who are alleging principles as a reason for doing nothing. As a matter of experience, they have not come to the conclusion that everything is as it should be in this country, and that notning wants mending. Mark the words, they are " men of business." It is the opprobrium already in store for the new 'Parliament. We will not quarrel with the word, but consider what it means. Men of business are not very Radical Reformers. They do not wish to reorganize society. They have even a fond hankering after green fields, patrimonial seats, village churches, and a simple peasantry. They are accustomed to deal much with men and things as they are. They claim confidence and respect, know there ought to be one head, and like peaceful organization. So they will never be very violent Reformers. On the other hand, they will not often be Conservatives of the obstructive class. They do not wish to keep things just as they are. They live in a world of change. Their families, their mansions, their warehouses, their factories, their mills, their ships or their railways, their villages or their towns, have grown, increased, and multiplied about them. They are in themselves, as they hope, improving and progressive,-in their fortunes, their natures, their families, and their position. Most of them remember with more pride than they choose to avow that they are greater than their fathers; yet they recognize the strong elements of character that struggled for growth and expression in their fathers, and were only suppressed by hard circumstances. This is their theory :-England is a good stock, of which much more may be made. It is but the rude material of much future greatness. It is full of oldbarbarisms, rugged exerescences, unruly growths, angry wounds, proud tumours, and sullen encumbrances. It is gnarled, knotty, and crossgrained, hard to be dealt with anyhow, but worth dealing with on any terms. The struggles of life and a slow emergence from the crowd have prepared such men for the severer social struggles through which England is doomed to pass on her way to better government. Granting, then, that "men of "businesa" form a considerable portion of the hundred and seventy new members, we may expect them to prefer the line of Progressive Improvement to that of Radical Reform or Obstructive Conservatism, or something still less practical than either. It is, indeed, already assumed that the new flouso will be eminently practical and businesslike--at least, that it will start with that character; and the very pe6ple who sneer at the result of the election and trace in it the influences of the Reform Act are preparing after their fashion to deal with it accordingly. They are going to bribe. the churlish beast, as they think it, with economical budgets. In fact, they have prepared a series of budgets, like box within box, each one more stingy than the last, and, whatever -the hapless CHAicEuoa of the ExcHEQuEP,B may offer, out will come another budget a shave less than his. When he has screwed his budget as low as honesty, safety, and decency will allow, they have then an endless vista of diminishilg budgets, like the arches of the Thames Tunnel in a child's peepshow. This prospective, or rather perspective ..finance,. has, already been rudely dispelled more than once,- but therein consists one of its princiial mierits in the eyea of the ingenious projectors. Being a perpetual fund of promise, it is-equaUyproductive of disappointments, sad, while the promises are set down to the credit of the financier, the disappointments mayr be boldyl laid to the charge of his antagonihts. It is they, of course, who provoke the.wars or other nmischance that interfere' withi the woiking of the cebeme. The c.onjuror who lived on the farmer by exorcizing the fiend out of his wife, his servant, hig eoaw, hormes, cats, dogs,j and poultry, set down all his failue to the malignity and strengthof the enemy, and so became daily more necessary to the health and peace of the farm. We believe, however, that the whole of this calculation will defeat itself, nmd be found utterly inapplicable to the clars of men said to predominate among the new members. " Men " of business" in this country know when and how to make money, when and how to save it, when and how to spend it. They don't always buy the cheapest article. They don't always choose the cheapest contractor, the cheapest servant, the cheapest tradesman, or even the cheapest horse., They will be disposed to take a budget very much on its own merits, and not simply ask whether one is not half-amillion lower than another. Cheap JoHN in finance is a feLow of the same sort as his namesake at a country fair. His only claim is cheapness, so his silly customers get something cheap, and nothing els,e. But we beg the new members-the busines men of them particularly-to observe how these cheap budgets and this prospective finance are thrust upon thenm, not only as something specially suited to the stingy souls that are attributed to them, but to the exclusion of everythig else that Englishmen wish to ee done. Here are a dozen other subjectr calling for legislation,-Parliamentary l3eform, Law Reform -itself a hydra of abuses tco be rectified-Church Reform, Education, the health, comfort, and appearance of our great cities, and the condition of the la'bouring poor. Now, business men have to deal with many men, and they generally wish to see those men, with their wives and children, as happy, enlightened, independent, and elevated as is compatible with the necessity of earning their daily bread by the sweat of their brows. The new Parliament, therefore, if it is constituted as we are told, will not be so wholly absorbed in reducing estimates but that it can spare somne heart and soul for the improvement of the people and the various means tending to that improvement. At all events, our " men of business," even if they do not quite see their way and acknowledge the difficulties which beset it, wi not manufacture obstacles and call them "'principles.") They will not traflick alike with the honour of our flag and the welfare of our people. They will not do this at first. What they will do when they have become more initiated in the ways of Parliament, and resigned their consciences to political cauists and confessors, we forbear to conjecture; but they will not do this while they wae still fresh from local influences, home duties, and healthy English life.
On the borders of a great Salt Lake in the heart of one of the most terrible. deserts ir. the world a community has established itself which ought to make uis blush for our generation, and to which the history of manldnd hardly furnishes a parallel. But a very few years have elapsed since an impostor named JosE-n S3rrr professed to be the recipient of a new revelation from GOD. On the strength of this comn22i2sion he produced a Bible and founded a religion, and before his death, 'which occurred during a riot within the walls of a gaol, his tenets had been adopted by a considerable number of followers. The scene of the imposture was in the United States, and Morznonism, as- the ziew persuasion was designated, presently became localized in a city of its own. From this seat, however, it was expelled by the alarmed and indignant population of the vicinity, and the Mormons carried themselves and their iustitutions into the midst of a wilderness, where it eemed probable at the time that they would escape the cognizance and contact of their fellow-men. But these speculations were upset through the discovery of gold in California, which prodigiously accelerated the growth of that marvellous State, and exposed the new Mormon settlement to the visits and observation of emigrants on their overland route to the diggings. Neverthelems, the isolation of the community was still maintained, and to such effect has the imposture been propagated that the doctrines of JoE S&a are now profesed and exemplified by a body of 100,000 persons, living under such conditions of moral and social existence as could hardly be credited if they were not so authentically described. In this territory of Utah, as it is termed, and in the city of the Mormons, the direct commission of the D]iTy is presumed to reside in the person of a Governor, named BrIuGnm: YouNG, who, with other elders, administers affairs according to his will. The community is considered to be a Chhurch, or body of the faithful, and aU its institutions are regulated upon the model of a theocracy. All persons external to this body are regarded as " Gentiles," nor do the Mormons appear to recognize any tie or obligation except such as arise from their own creed. Such is the theory of these institutions; in practice they have been developed into usages so revolting to the natural instincts of humanity as scarcely to admit of toleration, even when buried in the tracklems wilds of the Far West. The leading feature of Mormonism is polygamy, and every woman in the settlement is at the mercy of the men who may have raised themselves to authority. Thirty, forty, or fifty "wives" are claimed and appropriated by a single " husband," and, as the power of the rulers is supposed to be identified with the direct mission of the ALmGTY, there is no escape from their decisions. The same assumption dispenses also with law, for no law can pretend to authority comparable with the will of the SuPRZ= BEzuG as revealed through his vicegerent upon earth. To enforce, however, an obedience which might only be theoretically rendered, or which on the abatement of delusion might very probably be refused, a system of sanguinary terrorism has been organized, and a band of men stand sworn to execute the behests, whatever they may be, of the head of the Church. To what extent these atrocities are carried we now learn from a communication of unimpeachable character. The Federal Government of the United States, in virtue of its authority over all the territories of the Union, appointed Judge DRusmOND to preside in the Supreme Court of Utah, in which capacity he would, of course, exercise a jurisdiction independent of the Mormon Administration. Such a commisson, however, he has found it impossible to discharge, and he has resigned his office accordingly, conveying, at the same time, a full explanation of tho circumstances in a letter to the ArroniiiqyGENERAL of the Union, which we inserted at length in our impression of yesterday. In this astounding document Judge D:au.rEToND affirms that the administration of justice in Utah was reduced to a nullity by the tyranny of the Mormon governors, who by their influence over juries acquit or condemn at their discretion, and give impunity for homicide or instructions for assassination according to their capriees. Proceeding to details, this officer charges the Mlormons with having commissioned the Iudia3ns to murder Captain GtuNiSso' and his party of eight men, with having destroyed his own predecessor in office by poion -a w rith having deliberately murdeted the late T torial Secretary. As if to show, indeed, theirii pendence of any decrees but those of theiroin . Church, the Mormonsfare xsid to have desfrom$, the records and archives of the Supreme Court; and its President, therefore, reties from * position | where the authority which he represents is openly I set at nought, and 'where all the ordinary bonds of society andc obligations of law are violently thrust aside to leave free scope for a despotism without example. The collision thus probably provoked between the American Government and the Mormon community has been long anticipated. It has ofit been debated, indeed, to what extent toleration could be carried in a case like this, even on the abumption that the Mormons abstained from any offence beyond that attaching to their institutiona themselves; but they have now exceeded these limits, and have violated laws to which, as citizetis of the Union, they undoubtedly owed respect. It vas not binding upon them to profess Chrisianity, and, whatever might have been the scandal attending their licence and their lies, it was doubtful on what ground they could be assailed, especially after the self-imposed exile by which they buried their brutality and blasphemy in the solitudes of .a desert. But Utah, however desolate and remote,is American territory still, and the Mormons ean only occupy it on the same conditions of iolitical allegiance as are exacted from others. The soil on which they reared their city, though untenanted, was not unowned. It pertained to the dominion of the Union as entirely as any district in Massachusetts or Georgia, and the resistance of the settlers to the autuority of the Federal Government lawfully represented is an act of rebellion. It cannot be supposed that such an act will be overlooked by the Administration at Washington, and the whole question of Mormonism and its title to toleration will now probably be raised for practical solutioi. The Mformons are far off, but they are not out of reach. The desert is a frightful one, but it can be passed by the protectors of public order as well as by the miserable victims of spiritual delusion. unhappily, the whole case touches us nearly. Mlormonism, if conceived in America, is propagatea and supported in England, nor do we kiE6r of any sign of our times more bewildering tizn the success of this shocking imposture among,a civilized and instructed population. Witchcraft is a mere nothing by the side of this living a-dcl moving monstrosity. No pilgrim or crusader in pAst ages ever ventured upon such an expedition as is now undertaken by educated Christian wiith a huge den of vice and wickedness awaiting them at its close. The picture now given of these aboinitions by Judge DiumsmoND shows that tyrnny, -y a natural sequence of events, has been brought in aid of delusion, and that when once the unhapp?y proselytes have been entrapped no room is alowid them for repentance or return. It is this whith aggravates the enormity of the institution. It is terrible enough to think of the delusion itself, but the view becomes infinitely more alarming when it is known that violence and terror are prepared to overwhelm any symptom of penitence or remorse. This feature of Mormonism, at any rate, we may hope to see extinguished, and such an exposure as is now given may tend, we trust, to open the eyes of even the weak-est and most credulous to the real nature of the snare.
It seems that in our military and naval manage. ment the thing that has been shaU be. For two years the storm roused by the misdoings in the East has raged, and the public might be excused for thinking that it had swept away the evils which brought on such great calamities. Of late the world in general, and we with the rest of the world, had begun to think that enough had been said. Let the Crimean delinquents and the Scutari delinquents return to the obscurity from which they had emerged to an unhappy notoriety. The cause had been won, the proper effect produced, and no future war in our time would exhibit the incapacity and perverseness of 1854. A LucAN or an ARiEn would be impossible within the next quarter of a century. But we have been deceived. Here it is aU over again. The spirit of our late heroes of misrule stiU animates their successors who are to carry on the Chinese war. If the " insolent barbarian" himself were represented at the Admiralty we could not have proceedings less calculated to insure the speedy chastisement of our enemies. Ve will say nothing at present about the delay in sending out the steamers and gunboats, in default of which Sir MICEuEL SmmouR is lying on the defensive at the mouth of the Canton River. But the Transit has turned up again. On the 19th of this month she was in Corunna harbour, where she had put in "in deep distress." Two days of the Bay of Biscay had sent her in to be fresh rigged. A writer on board tells us -what all acquainted with the vessel knew before:-" You never saw a "worse seaboat in your life-crank, top-heavy, "and everything that is bad." . . . "Such an "old tub you never saw; the rigging never &.b "up or anything secured ; we had hard work tolkeep "the masts from going over the side." . . . " I " am certain," he adds, "she will never weather the "Cape, or she wil deceive all on board, both "soldiers and blue-jackets." . . . " You must "think what she must be when I tell you for a "truth that there are not a dozen men (troops) on "board with a dry hammock, every seam in her "deck letting in water." Such is the condition of a Government vessel with 800 troops on board, Just commencing her voyage of 16,000 miles ! Now, is not such an incident as this sufficient to justify the unceasing vigilance and the unsparing languago of the press? Here is a vessel which has been proved over and over again unfit for the conveyance of troops, and which broke down with the House of Lords a year ago in a trip of a few hours, and now we have it selected by the authorities to perform a voyage of immense length and difficulty with an entire regiment of British troops on board. Official indifference to advice and criticism has been displayed in the most provoking manner in the whole affair. The surprise of naval men, the remonstrances of the press, and even the warning of the accident at the Needles, have been alike disregarded, and the miserable craft, with its doomed freight, has been sent off, perhaps to destruction, certainly to disuter and danger. What a thing it is for this great nation, with its abundant resources and its boundless liberality, to reflect upon, that the melt who are sent out to fight its battles are soaked through nightly whenever there is any sea, and that they are calmly speculating on the probability of all going to the bottom together ! The Transit embarked the 90th Regiment nearly a month ago, and she is probably by this time hardly out of Corunna. So, if even she manages tci prosecute her voyage without any fatal mishap, we may form some idea of its duration. The unfortunate 800 will, of course, make a coasting voya8a after the antique fashion, stopping at every point in the way to refit after continually recurrtent breakdowns. The end of this modern Odyssey it in impossible to predict. The 90th may arrive in China old mEn with snowy beards, to tell the sad experience of long years of wandering.

Lady FRANXLI has resolved to send out another tnd a final Expedition in search of whatever trace way exist of the lost crews of the Erebus and 'Terror. We have so often and so earnestly come lorward to deprecate the renewal of these E5xpeditions in a public sense, that we ca3not now with any reasonable grace advocate the propriety or policy even of this limited attempt. The thing, iowever, is to be. Already a screw yacht, the Fox, now lying at Aberdeen, has been purchased, snd the command is to be given to Captain WCLMrrocX, who has already distiDguished himself ,even among the advcnturous band of Arctic Navigators. Thus much, however, we may venture to say, that it is impossible not to respect the noble pertinacity of LadyFRA NXLIN; and, since another of these desperate ventures is to be made, it would be a pity that the last relics of her little fortune should be sunk under the Polar ice. Others may look at this question from a different point of view, and mnay still entertain hopes which we have long sincs resigned. If any such there should be, we would call their attention to the fact that a subscription list has been opened for the purpose of assisting Lady F,NKLIX in this her last effort. We can give no further aid to the cause. We entirely approved the determination at which the Admiralty recently arrived, not to send out any more Arctic Expeditions at the public expense. Year after year they were despatched, and, save the barren honour of having achieved the North-West Passage, we 'know not what we have gained by these hazardous -Struggles among the eternal ice. Others, however, -we repeat it-may take a different view of the anatter, and, certainly, as far as Lady F"srKxx-'S cause is a sacred one, we very heartily wish tnat we could, in conscience, give it a more hearty support. Sir RoDERICx MURCUisoN, however, Sir 39n-Cis BBAUFoBT, Lord WROTTESLEY, General ~SABIN, and many other gentlemen of high :scientific eminence, are strenuously exerting themselves to promote the objects of the Expedition, ,and it may be that the announcement of this fact tnay induce others to follow their example. The .advertisement in which they develope their views will be found in another portion of our impression -of yesterday. For one thing, however, we stipulate. Let it be clearly understood by Captain MOUix5r0CK and his officers and crew that, come .weal, come woe, another series of voyages in search of them is not to be commenced. After an infinite series of hairbreadth escaDes aU 4the other searching Expeditions have safely returned; let us not incur the liability of having to send out half-a-dozen others in search of one from the success even of which very little is to le expected.
THEB PERSIAN EXPEDITION. The following letter from an officer of the Political Agency of Bagdad gives the latest new% from the Head-quarters of the Persian Expeditionary force. It will be seen that only by a happy accident could the attack on Mohanunerah Ie averted:- " Yesterday evening wo had a special tartar from Con-stantinople, who brought us news of peace, but the terms were not known. " I despatched a messenger to Bussorah immediately, but &ho will not be in time to save Mfohammerah, unless Outram had news by way of Aden. My last date from Bussorah is the 17th of March. On that day the General was to leave 33ushire for tho river, where all the transport4 were collected, and probably on the 21st they would go at Mo. hbammerah. " I enolose a rough tracing of the place, which shows -where the Persians havo raised'their earthworks; they are described as being very creditable pieces of work, and considerable resistanco was expected. We mav have news before the post closer, but I do not expect it till to-morrow. III have two tartars ready for Constantinople. " The force at Mohammerah was said to consist of 8,000 ,regulars, 4.000 Arab levies, 1,500 horsemen, and 26 guns, of which two are 24-pounders, four are 18-pounders, and the nemainder 9 and 12 pounders, including one mortar. Seven regiments of infantry, 1,200 horsemen, and about 700 Arab amatchlocknien are encamped on the north side of the -Mohammerah river; the rest on the south side."

FOREIGaY INTELLIGMzR E. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONIENT.) [The following appeared in our second edition of yes terday :-I PARIS, TUESDAY, ARIL 28. The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences was on Saturday last the scene of a more animated discussion than usually takes place in that tranquil assemblage of sarans. Baron Charles Dupin, brother of the ex-President of the Legislative Assembly, presented a report which he: had drawn up for the Academy of Sciences on the projected canal in the Isthmus of Suez. Baron Dupin is a member of both learned bo4ides, and, anxious that one should have no advantage over the other, has communicated to both his views on that undertaking. Baron Dupin is naturallya warm advocate of aprojectfromwhich doubtleas he anticipateagreat results; of the report itself Icommunicated a pretty full analysis about a month ago. In the course of the remarks with which he accompanied the presentation of the report on Saturday to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences Baron Dupin alluded to the opposition alleged to be offered to the undertaking by the English Ambassador at Constantinople. M. Dupin, moreover, was pleased to speak in rather strong terms about England in connexion with the doctrines of free trade, and from the remarks he let drop it could plainly be seen that we are all looked on by that gentleman as little better than commercial hypocrites. M. Dupin did not exactly use the French word which comes nearest to " humbuga," but the sense was much the same. Hestartledhislearnedcolleaguesby declaring. that it was a mistake to suppose that England was a country where free trade was practised. While England, he said, was "strumpeting" forth her "libre gchaw,tge," she was obtaining not less than 500,0()0,000f. from her Customs, and he instanced the manner in which the silk manufactures of France are received in England. England, in a word, was constantly boasting of her liberality in commercial matters, while she was, in fact, anything but what she proclaimed herself to be. Mi. Michel Chevalier, the einent political economist, who is alxo a member of the Academy, stood up and said that he could not help expressing his astonishment that so judicious a person as their learned colleague, M. Dupin, should have thought it becoming to make himself the echo of the syste. matic defamation of England which certain persons indulged in who were remarkable, some for their inaptitude as manufacturers, others for their arrogance; and who constituted, among the industrial classes in France, a minority small in number, but employed in incessant agitation. Those persons were in the constant practice of taLking of the in_ trigues of England, but it was only for the puarpose of masking their own intrigues, the object of which was the levying a perpetual tribute on their fellowcitizens by means of prohibition-a tribute to which they had no right whatever. He again expressed his surprise that such were the terms in which, a great and neighbouring nation was spoken of in the Academy of Sciences, and he regretted sincerely that such should be the case. England did not trumpet forth her doctrines of free trade. She had done more than that she had practised what she preached; she had carried out the principles she proclaimed, and, wrrhile other nations hared in the benefits of her policy,she did not make reciprocity a condition for that participation. After some further remarks the subject dropped. It is difficult to account for the bitter feeling which Baron Dupin occasionally exhibits when alluding to England. M. Dupin has lived in England, and is no stranger to the habits and usages of the English people. Far from entertaining any such feeling, Al. Dupin should rather feel grateful to England, for it was during his residence there, after the Peace of 1815, that he acquired whatever knowledge he possesses on commnercial, industrial, and political subjects, and which has obtained for him the title of sara,it. The most curious part of the affair is, that, ardent Protectionist or Prohibitionist as he is, Baron Dupin -was once a Freetrader, or, at any rate, a Liberal in commercial policy. He once wrote a popular work for the entertainment and instruction of the agricultural population, and in it he covered with sarcasm a la T11pin some unfortunate person who was, in his day, as illiberal as Baron Dupin is now. To explain this change would be difficult did not every one know the proverbial fickleness of the Dapins. The chameleon is unchangeableness itse%lf when compared to M. Dupin aiMs. The rapidity of the sensations and the mobility of mind of M. Dupin ainf have long been familiar to all who know him. M. Dupin combines in his single person several men; he is author, advocate, ju ge, president of various and conflicting legislative bodies, orator, and-of which, perhaps, he is most proud-a sayer of bOns mots. A collection of witticisms from Mi. Dupin would be valuable indeed. This extreme versatility, which consists in being " everything by turns hut nothing long " is, it seems, a characteristic trait of both brothers. Baron Dupin was once a Liberal in commercial matters, he is now a Protectionist at least. He once admired England,he now describes her, on certain points, as not a bit better than she should be. Next month, next week, perhaps to-morrow, I may have to announce that Baron Charles Dupin has shaken the walls of the Acad6mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques with denunciations against monopoly. The Grand Duke Constantine arrived yesterday by land at rarseilles. He was received by M. Belmont, the Emperor's Charaberlain; the Baron de Bourgoing, Equerry; Colonel Fav6, Orderly Officer; General Rostolan, Commander of the 9th Military Division; the Prefect of the Bouches du Rhone, and the General Commanding the same department. A battalion of infantry, with the band playing, lined the streets, and the Duke's carriage w/as eseorted by a troop of Lancers. He dines to-day at the Prefecture, wzhere the civil and military authorities are invited to meet him. The explosion of the great mine at the Frioul was to take place to-morrow. The Duke will be present to-morrow at the opera of the Martyrs (not of Sinope), commanded by the municipality, and he will leave Marseilles for Lyons at 12 o'clock on Wednesday. On the Grand Duke's arrival in Paris, which will be on the 30th of April, he will be received at the railway station by Prince Napoleon, who will accompany him to the Tuileries. The reception-room at the railway station will be splendidly decorated with French and Russian colours entwined and the arms of the two countries. The doors of the reception-room are decorated with sky-blue velvet and gold fringe. Within the room, which is 15 yards square, there are raised five stages, on which are placed sofas ana armchairs covered with blue velvet. The floor is covere with a rich scarlet carpet. A band of music is to play outside the terminus, which is to be decorated with French and Russian flags. To-morrow (Wednesday) the Directors of the Paris and Lyons Railway will proc"id to Macon, where they will wait to receive his Highness. Two waggons, forming a ealoon, with a gallery, have been sent to Marseilles to complete the train, together with several first-class carriages. The Russian Ambassador left Paris at 10 o'clock this morning to meet the Grand Duke. Two battalions of the Imperial Guard will be on duty at the railway terminus. The Imperial cor9ge will be escorted from the railway station to the Tuilerisi by a picke' of cavalry. There will be no troops placed on the passage, but all the military posts on the road will present arms, the drums Will beat, and at the Tuileries the ordinary guard of the palace wiU pay to his Imperial Highness the honours due to the Princes of the Imperial family. On his arrival at the Tuileries the Grand Duke will be received at the foot of the staircase of the Pavillon de l'Borloge by the Grand Master of the Ceremonies and the Grand Chamberlain. The Emperor will meet his flighncss at the top of the staircase. Hais Majesty will then conduct him to the drawing-room, where the Empress will be seated, surrounded by the officers and ladies of her household. The preSentation of the persons composing the service of honour will take place immediately. During the stay of his Imperial Highness the following, personis of the Emperor's household will compose the service of honourof his Imperial High. ness-viz., the Marquis de Belmont, the Emperor's Chamberlaini; the Baron de Bourgoing, HisMajesty's Equerry; amd Lieutenant-Colonel Fav6, Orderly Oflicerofthe Emperor. Atable service, achamber service, and a stable service vill be prepared for his Imperial Eigbness, and every time his Imperial Highness leave the Palace an escort of honour will precede and foUow his carriage, unless he shall otherwiso order it. The day after the arrival of his Imperial Highness in Paris the Grand Duke Constantine, the PMIinisters, *the grand officers of thepP own, 'the officers ao the household of their MA^e&stza and their boeixl Highneasez3 and the FPsailTtFfthe-Senate, the LeIative Body, and the Council of State, will inseribe their names for his Imperial Highness. Hislmperial Highnesa the Grand Dulke Coustantine 'will receive at bis departure from Paris and to thefrontier the samehonours as at his arrival. I am assured that the Emperor of the French is most anxious that thle vi,t of the Grand Duke Constantine to Paris should Dot be considered as, having a political significance. This is very possibly true; but it is equally true that persons about the Emperor, 'who are supposed to have considerable infuence, seem to think the contrary Every one knows that the erord, of Brussels, is the avowed-I might say the official-organ of the Russian Embassies. The influential persons alluded to, either at the Tuileries or in the Council of State, seem to have also adopted the Russian journal as their special organ and vehicle of communication between thom and the public. It is no longer in the Ministerial papers of Paris, nor even in the Moniteur, that we are to look for official documents and projects of administration before they pass into law-it is in the Nord, the journal by predilection of the Tuileries. The publication of the programme for the reception of the Grand Duke Constantine has been prohibitedto the Paris papers, and we find it complete in the Nord of Brussels of to-day, communicated, o chaud, as it issued from his pen, by the Grand Chamberlain, or, doubtless on his authority, by one of his entploy6s. Again, we find there the draughts of two projects of law relating to the privileges of the Bank, and now before the Council of State. When the Russian journal becomes thus the semi-official organ of the courtiers, the Emperor cannot wonder that the public persists in believing all they hear about Russian influences. The Emperor has ordered that a completecollection of the laws and regulations relating to the French marine shall be handsomely bound for presentation to the Grand Duke Constantine. This collection will embrace not only the adminittrative portion, but likewise the service on board ship and the service in the dockyards. It is said that the head-quarters of the French missionaries in China are to be established at Shanghai, where the French possess a plot of ground, which is to be fortified. A Roman Catholic Bishop is to 6ixhis residence at Shanghai. The Minister for Foreign Affairs received despatches by the last Indian mail from ML de Montigny, the French Minister who was sent to Cochin China. It is said thathe hassucceededinarranging a commercial treaty with the Government of that country. The draught of a bill for establishing a penal colony at N!ew Caledonia is to be presented to the Legislatie Body by the middle of next month.

The Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian was well received at Milan on the 19th inst. The official organs of the press speak of an " enthusiastic" reception, but in private letters it is simply said that the inhabitants of the capital of Lombardy appeavred to be well pleased to see the newr Governor-Genenal. After the garrison, which is composed of some 20,000 men of all arms, had filed off before him, the Archduke held a levee, at which all the clerical, military, and civil authorities. and seve- al of the Lombard nobles, were present. In the evening two or three of the principal places (squares) and several of the public establishments were illuminated, and something very like enthusiasm was displayed by the people when the Archduke, attended only by one of his adjutants, appeared among them. As his Imperial Highness was in an undress naval uniform, and wore a cap, some little time elapsed before he was recog,nized; but, when he was, a dense crowd assembled round him, and cheered him with might and main. The Archduke did nOt leave the Palace on the 20th until he went to the Theatre alla Canobbiana, and he was occupied during the morning of the following day in givng audiences to persons who had favours to ask or grievances to be redressed. No one who is acquainted with the new Governor-lGcneral' character doubts that he will do all in his power to increase the prosperity of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, and to sa.tisfy the reasonable wishes of its inhabitants, but his task will be an onerous and ungrateful one, for his powers are very limited, and the Lombards and Venetians require concessions which the lmperial Government neither can nor will grant. 1f rationally governed, the AustroItalians will probably remain quiet, but nothing will ever reconcile them to their political position. Persons who have been on board the Novara state that the arrangements which have been made for the accommodation of the scientific part of the intended expedition round the world are most judicious. On deck there is a very roomy saloon, and another between decks On the outside of the stern of the vessel there is a kind of gallery, which in calm weather is likely to be a favourite place of resort. The ship's guns have been removed, and the gunroom fitted up as a study, in which is a large and well-assorted colletion of books and the best maps and charts that could be procured for love or money. Ais the men of science are Germnans, it in almost superfluous to remark that smoking in the study will not be prohibited. The mathematical instruments, &c., are by the best makers, and some of them are presents received from English, French, and German celebrities. The crew, which consists of 200 men, was chosen from among 400 volunteers, and there will be a band composed of 12 men on board, as music is supposed to be necessary to the wellbeing of the fellow-conntrymen of Mozart and Haydn. After the Swiss army was disbanded, the great bulk of the nation appeared well content to leave the settlement of tke Neuchatel questlon to the diplomatists, but recently considerable excitement has manifested itself in some of the cantons, and popular opinion again presses somewhat heavily on the Federal Council. The Democratic party is indignant at the " tricliness" of Prussia, and it has so little confidence in its own Government that it insists on the National Assembly being convoked when the acceptance or rejection of the proposals of the Paris Conference is to be decided on. Thne Minister of the Inlterior and his agents in Hlungary are doing all in their power to insure a good reception for their Majesties. The moral spur is vigorously applied to inactive or unwilling communities, and those which display a readiness to open their purses are strongly recommended to prove their loyalty by the size and magnificence of their triumphal arches, obelisks, &c. It is stated that when the Commercial Bank of Per,th proposed to contribute 6,000fl. towards some charitable foundation, to be named after the Empress, the offer was accepted by Baron Augusz, the Vice-President of the Statthalterei, but with the remark, that tkre was no reason why the establishment should not contribute something towards the preparations whiclL were being made for the reception of their Majesties. Although the old Contervative, nobles are still sulky, they will go to Pssth, and d4xe after the state carriage,, instead of riding beriHa it, in theirsplendid costumes. A "banderium" of 600 horsemen 'il encamp on the "R Iakoschfeld," near Pesth while their Majesties are there. The dress will be that worn by the Csikos. (The word,, which is pronounced " chickosh,' means " a k'eeper of horses.") Here you have a full-length portrait of such a man :-The fieure is generrilly tall and slim, the features weli eut, the r,omplexion dark, the hair on the head black, long, and lustrous, andthe mousOaches long Pnd well greased. The dress consisis of a very f.ull-cut linen shirt, and of drawera (ga%y%) of the same material, which are extremely, fu., and .,not fastened at the szucle; onx the hoaj is a round, low hat,; _.i~-tli-bTakr-ibadai r roud . the: neck is' a black fandkerebief, wrhich, if properly tied, has two bows as large as those worn by '" nigger" dan. diesd over the shirt is worn a crimsOn garment,; vhich is very like a short flannel-jacket not but- toned; the well-made foot is invariably enclosed in I a laced boot, to the heels of which are attached spurs. A more picturqsque figure than a Hungaria Caikoo galloping over the pusztas and cracking his I long and heavy whip it would be difficult to fiad. During the fortnight of their stay at Peath 60 persons will daily have the honour of dining at their Majesties' table. Two grand balls wil also be given by the Archduke Albrecht, the Governor-General of Hungary. We learn from Lemberg that on the 35th of this month the murrain (Laser-Dmrre) was in 68 places in Gallicia. Of 22,152 head of cattle kept on 104. farms, 1,073 animals had been seized by the plague, of which 676 had died, 157 had been knocked on the head, and 85 had recovered. 155 are still under treatment. It is now alternately snowing and raining, and the thermometer, which three days ago was at 74.75 in the shade, is now at 36.50. The sudden ehanges, in the temperature have given to Vienna the welldeserved reputation of being one of the most unhealthy cities in Europe. A.PBL 26. The Vienna Presse of this morning contains the' following telegraphic despatch:- "PARIS, AP= 25, 8 r.m. "M. de 6Bourqueney, the French Ambassdor. at the Court of Vienna, has announood that the difference between Aushris and Sardinia is on the point of being settled." As has alteady been said, there seems to be a tacit understanding between the two Governments, that nothing shall be done which could tend to widen the breach between them, but the assurance has been given me that the intelligence contained in the foregoing despatch is "pure invention." The current report, that Austria has expressed her readiness to renew her diplotmatic relations with Sardinia "if King Victor Emmanuel will consent to dismis Count Cavour," is equally unfounded. What this Cabinet requires from Sardinia is, that the official organs of the press should not be permitted to display such systematic hostility towards Austria, and that the Prime Minister of King VictorEmmanuel shor.ld cease to keep alive a revolutionary spirit by receiving deputations composed of the disaffected subjects of other Italian Governments. PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR OWN OOnRZsPoZNDT.) BERLTN, APrRi 27. There is just now a perfect dearth of news from all quarters. .I have nothing fresh to report toyou zince my last of the 25th inst. After having enjoyed ten days or a fortnight of beautiful spring weather, in which the trees and the grass commenced the resumption of their verdure and foliage, we are again visited with wintry cold, snow, bail, and east wind. The same chaKnge is reported to have taken place in the weather at St. Petersburg, where E3:aster, which falls with them much later than with u6, ha5 been signalized by falls of snow. _ - ITALY. The Piedmontese Senate, in its itting of the 25th, voted the Bill for the fortificatioD of Alessandria by a majority of 45 to 8. A serious misunderstanding has arisen between the Sardinian Cabinet and the Municipality of Genoa touching the portion of entrance dues which are to be paid into the Royal treasury. The law fixes the sum at 800,000f.; the Communal Council at its last sitting virtually refused to pay the tax by voting only 90,000f. ; after which the whole Council resigned. It is believed that the Government will send a Royal Commissioner to take charge of the municipal affairs of the city until the Council be reorganized. From an official report published by the Monitore Toscano, it appears that the net produce of the Tuscan Customs ini 1856 was 16,446,691 lire (13,705,575 francs), being 556,851 lire more than the sum fixed in the budget for that year. A letter from Florence of the 19th inst. tells us that such is the difficulty in finding competentpersons to fill public offices in Tuscany, that the director of the Government snuff manufactory has been ap pointed Administrator of the Hospital of Florence. Some time since a subaltern Custom-house officer was named superintendent of public buildings and chief architect, and subsequently postmaster. general. All the distinguished men in the country hold constitutional opinions, and are consequently excluded from office. The Advocate Galeoti an eminent Roman lawyer, who was excluded from the Papal amnesty published in 1849, has been at length permitted to return to theRoman States, but on condition that he shall confine himself to his native place, a small village on the borders of Tuscany. This generous amnesty has been grantedattheintercession of some influential personages who were clients of the illustrious advocate, who himself holds very moderate opinions, and who was appointed Minister of Justice in the year 1849 to prevent the administration of justice falling into the hands of the Radicalparty. Suchan amnesty is more injurious than beneficial to Signor Galeoti for the present, inasmuch as his professional practice is more lucrative in a capital like Florence than it could be in a countrv village. A letter from Naples of the 17th inst. Informs us that, on the preceding day, military mnanoeuvres took place at Falciano. These manceuvres were commanded for more than tbree hours by the King, who rode there on horseback, with the Duke de Calabria and Counts Trani and Caserta. Count Trapani was likewise on the ground. The troops reviewed were the 2d and 3d Swiss Regiments from Naples,the 1st Swiss Regimentandthe 2dRegiment of grenadiers from Maddaloni,the battalion of Riflemen of the Guard, the 1st Grenadiers, a battalion of Marines, and the 3d Regiment of Chasseurs from Caserta. SPAIN. THE FORTHCOMING SPEECH OF THE QUEEN OF SPAIN. The Dgbats of Wednesday publishes an analysis of the Royal speech, which will be read by General Narvaez, in the Queen's name, on the 1st of May, at the opening of the Spanish Cortes. The speech is drawn up by M. Pidal. It will announce the re-establishment of a good understanding between Spain and Rome, and renewal of friendly relations with the Court of Russin. The hope is expressedthat the difference withMexico will be amicably settled, but not unless the honour of Spain is satisfied and the interests of Spaniards in Mexico guaranteed in future, and an Indemnity paid to those who have suffered. Should the conditions put not be ,granted, Spain, despite her sincere wish for peace, will not hesitate to have recourse to coercive measures. The Queen calls the attention of the Cortesto the internal condition of the country. Peace and order prevail everywhere. A veil of oblivion is to be thrown over the past. The difficulties caused by the high price of provisions have been happily overcome by a series of well-combined measures. The loan is especially mentioned as having enabled the Government to act without complying with the enormous exactions of Spanish capitalists The conditions of the loan have been faithfully fulfilled. The Queen will recommend a series of politicaland financial reforms; a Bill for the reform of the organizsationi of the Senate will be brought forward very early in the session, as also a Bill for reforming the regulations of the two Chambers. The Senate, as now constituted, consists exclusively of xembers appointed by the Queen for life. It is proposed to introduce a new element into this great body which will give it greater authority and add to its lustre. The Senate would losenothing if it comnpr3sed a certain number of hereditary Senators, selected from the Grandees of Spain and possessors of large territorial fortunes. The fortune woud be the dotation of the title, and would descend from generation to generation with the title to the eldest sons of the senatorial families. The existing regulations of the Senate and of the Chamber of Deputies have engendered many abuses, which continually impede the public service and the progress of the Governmneut, and will ultimately throw discredit upon the Parliamentary system. Finally, the speech from the throne will give some explanations on the Bills that-will he presented by the Government for the regulation of the finances, with a view to establish the financial sys.- tamn upon the principles of econoPaical scienceoand the wisdom of experience. The Queen wfill inftorm ith Cortes that tha giana of the Minister of Fhaarxce wvill be submitted to them at. the.same tiine aa the budget for 1858. (mBoM an ow aoonnrPoNDEr}.) Certain Spaniards inI E an haezecently 'wrtte lttew t tesia b~e -aetig BaYth EnglishGovernment is hostile to the Prent dynasty in Spain, and would encourage. pua for ith overthrow.' These letters have b0eu shown, theircoui. tents talked of, and they have douistless excited satisfaction and hope in the brb of nunerou enemies of the throne of Ibella IL Te aertions they contain are, however, entirely false_ I-need but very briefly repeat what I lately positively affirned, that England, and, there can be scarcely.a doubt, France also, vill maintain the present Queen so long as they can posibly doSo within certain limit of interference. I may add that, acting in accordance with the instructions of his Government, the British Minister at Madrid not only takei uo heed of, hut utterly ignores, all the schemes of the above subversive tendency that have been, and stil are, at times putforward. l'n much talked of manifesto, hitherto unpublished, of Marshal Espartero to theProgresista electors of Barcelons, is now before me. It is a wellwritten document, - and although its great and, as it would seem to Engiish readers, superfluous length, would renderitscompletepublication inyorcolbunng a matter of difficulty, its entire sense and substance may be given witbin a moderate compass. After a rapid sketch of his services and career, and a denunciation of those who generously and opportunely select the present time to cry hini down, and to declare him incapable and politically dead, the Duke vindicates his constant adhesion to that liberal- union which was the result of, and imposed upon him by, the military insurrection andc popular revolution of 1854, and the votes of the ConstituentCortes. He could not doubt, he says, of the sincerity of that union, which for two years the majority of the Cortes, the most important personages of the Liberal party, and many of his own most intimate friends and allies, declared to be indispensable to the salvation of the country. To insure its duration he sacrificed all personal feelings, and-was inexorable only when the fundamental principles of hi political creed were inqueption. Condemned to the difficult task of reconciling heterogeneous and often antipathetic elements, of compensating diverse tendencies and opposite movements, always calumniated by his adversaries, and often unjustly judged by his friends the Presidency of the Counciw was to him a prolonged ^nd insupportable torture. Many times he desired to resign it, and refrained only In compliance with the urgency of higfriends and of many who are now his friends no longer. But while, inunisonwith the Conatituent Cortes (to whom he thinks posteritywill do more justice than they have received from their contemporaries), he laboured to establish in Spain a truly constitutional regime, a vertigo of ambition and a reactionary apirit took possession of certain men, who perhaps now heartily repent their own work. Following a plan prepared long beforehand, theso men waited the opportunity of a rupture. This vws afforded by the vacation of the Cortes, and the pretext only was wanting. This, too, was found. Escosura had entered the Cabinet with the consent of all the Minister& and had been for mi months an active member of the Administration spealdng in its name almost daily in the Cortes,ana never having a dispute or discussion with any one of his colleagues. lispartero continues;- "Nevertheless, on Escosura's return from Valladolid. whither he bad been, by unanimous agreement, and as representative of the whole Government, on account of a political question entirely foreign to the unhappy events (the incendiarim and disturbances in June, 1856) of the capital of Old. Castile, the Minister of War (O'Donnell), after opposing, for four hours, the opinion of his colleague With arguments which he himself has sinoe quliied aspretexts, ended by declaring that he considered his tenure of officeincompatible with his. While the otber Miniater, astonished at such an unexpected hostility, and unanimously approving the Minister of the Interior, the only charge against whom was that he was too liberal, endeavowred, with patriotic zeal, to conciliate minds and smooth away difference, Escosura handed to me his resignation, and the Mfinister of War announced to me that if Escosura did not quit the Cabinet he himself would resign. The conflict lasted for threo days of inexpressible anguish. All that the spirit of conciliation could suggest-all that human dignity could yield without degradation-all was tried-an were willing to sacrice for the sake of the union. But this was now impossible. Those who till then had profited by it thought themselves strong enough to break it, and only on the condition that it would be for one a stamp of ignominy, and for the Progresistas a chain, would they have consented stiUl nominally to preserve it. My resolution was instantaneous, but immutable. To refuse to agree to the expulsion of the Minister charged with laberalism-of a Minster who had a majority in the Cortes, and who,' in truth, was guilty of nothing but zeal for the good cause and friendship for Espartero-to refuse also to agree that tbe' Minister of War should retire, when there vwas no cause for his bo doing-to declire to Her Mzjeety that, as the retirement of either of the two raembers of the Cabinet in question could not, under the circumstances, but produce fatal oonsequences, Icoulddo no less, if both did not agree, than also to resig. Any other course would have been to degrade myself, and that uselessly, and to be wanting to the Throne and to the nation. I carried out my resolution. lIy reasons were not listened to; the sacritice of the Progresista Minister appeared convenient; and, with hir, were accepted my res"nation and the resiguations of our other most worthy colleagnes, lie who, until then, had also been so in the Department of War, charging himsselEfwith the formation of the new Cabinet, This is the truth, succinctly told, hut faithfully explained, conoerning those events." The Duke then speaks of his conduct during the crisis, which lasted too long for posible concealment, and during which Madrid was in a ferment, the different fractions of the Liberal party assembling for common defence, the reactionary party mnarshallig its forces, and a conflict apparently imminent. His advice, he says, to those who approached him was to remain quiet and within the Aiits of the strictest legality; if, she said, they were attacked, right would be visibly on their aide. above all, he insisted thathis name should never be made a banner of discord and civil war. On quitting the palace at dawn on the 14th of July, no longer Minister, he renewed his recommendations and entreaties, and, hoping that his complete disappearance from the scene wouldcin some degree calm the excitement of the public mind, he left his official residence and repaired to that of a friend; but all was in vain; the lTational Guard was under arms, not, as has been alleged, to embarrass the exercise of the Royal prerogative, but to preserve order and to protect the deliberations of the Constituent Cortes, then assembled, in fulfilment of their sacred duty, to deliberate on the difficult situation of the country. For many hours the new Government might have avoided the bloody conflict by going to give explanlations in the Cortes, or by at least replying to a message from that body-a message which, on the contrary, was received with contempt and ignominy. The conflict begun, Espartero declares that nothing could equal the martyrdom he endured at being compelled to inaction. "The charge founded on this complete inaction," he says, "is the gravest and most unjust of all those brought against me. There is little generosity in attacking one who, it is well known, neither can nor ought to say all that would combine to justify him." On this point the Duke maintains great roserve, but intimates enough to confirm what every one here well knows, that the conflict was not, as it was endeavoured at the time, both in and out of Spain, to make it appear, a struggle between two Ministries, but between the Throne and the people. The Queen had, as usual, broken her promises, and, in conjunction with O'Donnell, betrayed the man who certainly saved her crown in 1854. The Progresista party, the people of Madrid, the whole nation, in short, knew this, and the Throne was in greater )eril than ever; for, had the popular cause triunmphed, it would assuredly have been swept away-at est for the time, and probably never to be again occupied by her who now sits upon it. On this part of the subject Espartero, with his habitual respect for Royalty, abstains from spking plainly; but the foUowing lines are signifcant and inteligible enough to all acquainted with the events of the last three years in Spain:- " How could I take part in tho fratricidal strife which had commenced in spite of all my solicieude, whea it ws evident to me that the fatal imprudence of tbee who had provoked ithad rendered impossible that its rest should not be the immediate, altIough transitory, rain of one of the institutons to wohose spportanddef,ee I bave oon- secrated my whole life s I will say no more. You wi divine that which duty tchids ms to speak, I will say no more, whatever the psosocation add6essed tme, whatever the imputations caat _e me." m,waee -think I have. given you, either in extract ce summaxy, aU that is reallY inm ortant in this donu, maent, which is remarkable as a composition, axud with which Esparteros friends appear, upon the. whole, to be satisfied, as expilantory, and, to a grea extent, excul3patory of his conduct at this nisi of atirs, although it does not do away with their regret that te did not, at an earlier peried of is Government, give ear to those who *oarned him of treason in the cmp.

There has been rather less gloom in the StockExchange to-day, but the market is still weak, and the speoulators generally are tired of looking for a avourable change. Consols for money opened at the closing quotation of yesterday-924 to -, and declined to 92k to g. A recovery then took place to 92*, but the final price was 92g. For the 7th of Way they left off at 921, while for the new account, in June, the last transactions were at 93i to i. There was less inquiry for money in the Stock-Ex. ebange, and loans on Government securities were obtainable at from 6i to 7 per cent. In the discount-market and at Ithe Bank of England the demand also was) understood to be less urgent. The expectation that no advance in the rate of discount will be deemed necessary this week gained ground, and there was still an absence of gold withdrawals. The severity of the weather exercises a depressing influence, since anxiety is en- tertained lest «a similar condition should so far I have prevailed throughout Europeas to affect the rospects of the silk crop. Bank Stock left off at E13 to 214; Reduced, 91# to i; New Three per Cents., 91A to a; India Stock, 220 to 222; Exchequer-bond, 98i to j; ludIa Bond 10F7. to N. discount; and Exchequer-bils (June); 5s. to ls. discount, (March) 2f. discount to 2s. premium. Friday next, the 1st of May, being the day for the half-yearly balance at the Bank, the transfer offices will be closed and a holyday will most likely bo kept at the Stock-Exchange, Foreign securities were steady, and towards the close prices m some cases exhibited comparative firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. have been negotiated at 92i, ;, i, J, and J for money, and 92k and 93 for the account. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were dealt in at 99i and J. The general business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100o; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 98i; Buenos Ayres, 86; Danish Three per Cents., 85g and i; the Five per Cents., lOli; Mexican Three per Cents., 23kt and i; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44i- ; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Spanish Three Cents., 41; the New Deferred, for money, 24" and {; and for the account, 25k.f and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65k. The corn-market was firm this morning at the rates of Monday. The heavy fall on the Paris Bourse has made further progress, and the final quotations of the Three per Cents. this evening were 68f. 60c. for money 'and 68f. 55c. for the Present account, showing a further deeline of three-eighths per cent. The Russian organ Le Nord, of Brussels, which is musully well informed on all French official matters, publishes the text of the Bill ubmitted to the Council of State for carrying out the new arrangement between the Government and the Bank of France. The following are the provisiona, and they correspond in all material respects with the outline already given in the various commercial letters from Paris. The existing charter, which would expire 10 years hence, namely, on the 31st of December, 1867, is to be prolonged for 30 years, and is to terminate on the 31st of December, 1897. The capital of 3,650,0001. Is to he doubled, the newr shares being allotted to the proprietors pro ratd at 1,100f. for every 1,000f. share. Out of the sum thus raised 4,000,0001. is to be set apart as a reserved fund (in addition to the existing reserve of 620,0001.), and to be invested in 3 per Cent. Rentes, which will be iasued by the Finance Minister from the sinkinq fund in four quarterly amounts from the date of e present la, such Rentes to hs delivered to the Bank at the average quotations of the preceding month. The sums thus received by the Treasury are to be applied to the public service, but a sinking fund of 1 per cent. is to be created for their repayment. It is further provided that, in consideration of the advantages derived by the Bank from the Treasury balances, they are to engage to exctend their advances on Treasury-bonds from 2,2000001., the amount now due, to 3,200,0001.-a total which is to be reduced by annual instalments to an ultimate limit of 2,400,0001. These advances are not to bear interest, except when they exceed the amount of Government balances in the hands of the Bank, and then the rate is to be the same as that for discounts, with the understanding that it is never to be more than 4 per cent. The effect of the measure on the moneymarket will therefore be precisely the same as that of a loan, and under these circumstances some dissatisfaction will doubtless be felt at the Governinent having so recently as two or three months back annoumeed that nothing of the sort would be required for the service of the ensuing year. On the question whether the Bank contemplate an increase in their paper issue no information has transpired. The only means by which it could be effected would be by the creation of notes of a smaller denomination than those now in circulation. By that step a considerable amount of gold might possibly be set free, and a palliative, but only temporary influence would be exerted on the prices of stocks and shares and all other commodities. Lord Overstone, as one of the three commissioners appointed to report on the decimal currency question, has just issued an elaborate and lucid series of inquiries to draw forth a thorough exposition of aU the difficulties and objections that may be considered to stand in the way of an alteration of system. Points which have hitherto been slurred are in this document made to assume their proper proportions, and the evidence which it invites ean scarcely fail to place the Leols. lature in possession of a fund of information that must effectually remove aUl danger of a change being enforced upon superficial conclusions. So clear are the scope and constraction of each question that even the ordinary reader is in most cases enabled to apprehend and answer it without hesitation, and perhaps it may be said that any person previously unacquainted with the subject, but wishing to master it as rapidly as possible, could not do better than scan these inquiries and leave the result to his own common sense. A plan which, like the pound and mil scheme, requires the previous schooling of au entire nation before its promoters could hope to establish it, must have some inherent defect, and few will read Lord Overstone's questions without detecting where it lies. They will also be led to conjecture that without a previous or concurrent alteration in our system of weights and measures the step would be utterly impracticable. The invaluable experience of the United States through a long period of years is cited, and seems conclusive'as to the impossibility of doing away with those convenient divisions into halves, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths, which are common to a coinage of pence and shillings, but which must be excluded from a strictly decimal arrangement. The Americans have had the wisdom to avail themselves both of the decimal and the vulgar methods. Dollars and cents are the coins of account, while the small change of their markets consists of pieces of 12i and 65 cents (equivalent to our sixpences and threepences), andthe mior fluctuations in the prices of goods, such as cotton, sugar, &c., are expressedby the eighth or the sixteenth of a cent, the cent being equivalent to sour halfpenny. This is found to answer every purpose, not only of scientific calculation, but of market dealings, and as it is in our power to adopt it when- ever we please, and to assimilate our practice with that of the country which shares with ourselves the trade of the world, without altering or withdrawing a single coin at present in use, it will require some very extraordinary reasons to induce the public, if a change is to be resolved upon, to neglect it for one which will subvert all existing habits.

RAILWXAY LIBERALrTY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As it is through the medium of 27w Tima that all our grievances are righted against railway and steamoacket companies, &c., I think it only fair that equal Publdt shoud be given to acts of liberaity and attention. I shall tberefore feel much obliged, should your space allow of it, if you will do an act of justioe to the South Wales Rail. v w.y Company. I was one of a few passengers who, owing .o the boat from Waterford on Tuesday lat not reaching Milford in time for the 8 a.m. train, would have been seriously detained on my jonzmey. On arrivin I represented my case and that of other passengers to the railway authorities, and they immediately put a sial train on to Swansea, a distance of 70 miles, to enable us to proceed without delay, and I was thus enabled to reach Southampton that night in time to sail by the packet which left at midnight. As I should have been one of the first to "issue forth my lond complaint in vain " had I been detbined, I think it but right that I should, through your journal, givo pablicity to this act of attention on the nart of thea pm- _ JTsT. pany, wishing at a*1 times to be

JAriwAY IHWZDLGZ2ro GREAT INDIAN PENM8ULA- The half-yearly mengof this oompany wa_siUR ..w day at the London Tavern; Mr. W. J. ilt m chair.Sh Mr. Watt, the seoreti, rea the report, an abstr of 'which appeared in 27sc Time. of Monday. The UHATIA, in moving the adoption of the ort, stated that be felt great satisfaction in congratuatingihC. en their prospects and tbe p of tbeir affiir in India. Prom information they k1F 'ird the preogres had beeo morethan he had anticipated. It apped from tho at%.. n'ent of the chief engineer that the progres of the workon, their line was most atisfactory. le woa perfs o Uy ataed with the contractors; no delay had arin from thoe entlemen, and the reports brought by the last mall eon mad those statements which the engineer had sas hose. As to the details of ther prooeeding in Inda it would be unneoessary for him to detain them, as a full tatement Was given in a small pamphlet circulUed among the shar. olders, in which they would iee the exact poition of their affairs. He thought there eould be no doubt, as stated in the report, of the ultimate prospenty And gueom of their underaking. (Heair, hear.) The report alluded to the progress of the works on the line from Callian to Poonahl and holapoor, which had bis let in tbree contracts. It was intended to lay down a portion of the permanent way above the Ghauts, and aranrements for the transport of the rolling stock to the line beyond the Chats were2 being made so as to bring that portion f the line into operation befoe the portion ot the railway up the Ghauts could be completed. They would thusl progess with the line towarde Sholapoor pending theexecutionof the works upthe BhoreGhant. Th perin on of the Goerment had been applied for to carry on the otherportion of the line towards the north-east, and thre ections ha been let. As there was some difficulty in the scent of the Ghauts, Mr. Berk1sy, thei g , bad proposed an alteorntive line by tking advamtage of tihe llleys, tunnelling from one valley-to another, and thus formingakdnd of loop lne, by which the prop d steepest gradient of 1 in 37 on the shortr line would be reduoed to 1 in 66 or 67 on the loop line, which wow bea very material advantage in working the traffic. The dorter line would be nine miles in 7eungh, while the loo linewold be only 2 miles in length. They woud ths ottain a mnot important advantage in the Vadients by meas of the additional three miles. With regard to the traffic receIpt., the returns ahow2d that they averaged 3l,000 rupes day, wile at thelst meeting they avered only I0,OOG rapees, sihowsnn a considerable increae. With regard to thelr additional capital, it had been taken up, with the exoption of a small portion, and thcy Wa no reason to suppose that it would not be taken up in Bombay. He then adverted to the retirement of Mr. Nioholson from the oifice of Superintendent-Director. The respation of Lr. Nicholson took place in consequenoe of havng made some suggestions at tho board for forming a company of contrac. I tors to execute works in India of which ha would be member. They told him they thought it was not quiteeon. istent with his position in the comrpany to cary out those sIggestions. Fnding that hispropositionws notapproved by the board he reigned, and the vacancy at the boerd was flled up by the appointment of fr. L. X Reid, formerly a member of the council and Acting Governor of Bombay. Mr. J. G. PXR= seoonded the motion for the adoption of fr. SRA JLN wrished to know the tol amount of nterest they had reoeived from the Est India Company, anid whtwas theestiated oost of thes88 miles nowin opera tion, including wrorking sk, so as to enable them to calculate the percentage of the net earnin of the line on the Capital expended on that norton of their undertakin. The CaAIRifAyaFt ihat the amount ofone re celedi th shpeof interest from theEatIdaCm pan wa 17,801.in England, and 36,3771. in India-togeirye&sther 1,82Table A in the pamphlet showed the average co6t of the 88 miles of line, exclusiveof rolUin stock, to be 5,837h. per mile. The onst of the rolling sock ws about 728. per mile, malrng together 6,565h Mr. Pescz was not by any mexas satisfied with the pro. gress of the works. They had been 7T years ontructing 88 miles of railway. He hAd no objection to the retiremens of Mr. Nicholson, is he (Mr. Price) did not think they reguioed a uperintending-dirtor, an imperium in impero; he thought it a most unsatisfactory arrangement, and he congrtulted them on its termination. He thought an infau sion of new blood into the direction would be beneficicL The contractors were Englishmen and he thought there would be no difficalty in pushing on the works with vigour. They were told that India could produce immense quatities of tea, cotton, and so forth, and now that they were at war wt bn a the time to Push forward the railwa3 in Indit He wdhd to kno e wher there was an ot er matter between the directors and Mr. Nicholson, and whether they considered it desirable to move a vote of thanks. He concluded 'by mOvinOg An amendment, to the effect that the first paragraph in the report should be omitted. The Pargrph stated that the reportswhich the directors continued to receive from Bombay were in every respect most grtifYing as to the progress of the affairs of the company. Mr. WILD seconded the amendment. Mr. SEs with respect to the dela complained of consIdered himself an authority. They al knew that the East India Company moved slowly. The delay did not take Place from any.Swant of energy in the directors, and it was not until 1850 Or 1851 thatn t done in respet of the works. He knew some of the dificalties that Were experienced in England in carrying out railwy works, but the were nothing to those experienod in Indi Mr AUsTI thought that contract No, 12, extending 190 mle, was too much for one contractor. Mr. RIcMoIND said it was well known in the earlier Proobedings of the company that the Board of Directors of the Ast ndiaCompLnyvery reluctantly entertaned the question of railways, but they had since taken adiffcnt View. About eight or 10 ea go the East India Comi pany might bave covered Indiu with railays atamuch less cstthan at present. Many gentlemen Present would recollect the diffcuties that were interposed to the introduction of railways in India; the promoters had been compelled to submx to a pame of "hattlodore and shuttlecock" btween the East India Company and the Board of Control, obvious that their 8inutrofductiion cudiu d benoloner re- Mr. G. Sa=ff hopedthe amendment would be withdrwn, as it was neesary they should act with unanimity. The CAnuiw replied to the observations of Mr. Price as to the alleged slow progress of the undertaking. He did not think it necessary to advert to the game of battledore aLnd shuttlecock between the East India Company and the Board of Control whic h been mentioned, hut the shareholders should not suppoSe that anything of that kind now existed. The boardof directors were on the besttermswith the authorities. They had to construct and work railways at an immense distance from London, to send the Permanent Y, ironwork, engines, carrA9es, waggons, and so forth, from England to India, and thus employed a lArge number of ship. At the same time there were also being sent out materials for two or three other railwaYs in India, taking up an enormous amount of tonnaLge. They had aL large staff sureying thousandx of miles witha view to seect the best route. Then to obtain the approval of the Government the consultin engineer had to make out the necessary plans and so forth for the contractors prior to tenders for the contracts bein received. There were delays from natural causes also, an he contended that the directors had done everything they could to carry out the objects of the company. Notwithstsnding t'ose difficultisg theyv had completed 88 miles of railway, and they were constructing an additional length of 220 mles of railway, which would be open for traffic in he course of three yers from the present time, and they would then have 308 miles of railway in operation. The next call wouldi be 21. on the new share to place them on a footing with the shares upon which 41. was paid. With regard to the contract for 190 miles in length Mr. Bray had one for 170 miles, and he found no difficulty in proceeding with it. Between 1'oonah and Sholapoor alone there were 21,000 labourers at -ork, and he thought it rather hard that any shareholder should complain of the rate of progress made. All the contracts were let by public tender on a schedule of prices. They found that the best course, as it left the engineers at liberty to make any alterations in the time they might deem expedient. There was nothing further than he had stated with reference to Mr. Nicholson's retiremet; they had reason to be satisfied with the manner in which he had perE ormed his daily duties, but they did not approehisugesios wthegadt th popoedcompany,The consider it desirable to propose a vote of The amendment was then put and negatived by a very vn tho motion for the adoption of the report a discussion ensued in respect of the large balance in the treasury of the East India Company subscribed by the railway com- R FID contended that the available balnce amounted to 1,000,0001. in the hands of the East India Comspeny, and, although the shareholders were paid Sper cent, on the amount suhacri d, they would at a future tune have to repay that annm ount before they ould8geot anythyring beyondf 5per oent, per annm ut f ~eprfit o th rilwy.By the present mode theloss to the company would be abut 50,000L Mr. Ayromo, M.P, as one of the directors, was much obliged to the shareholders for taking so much interest in the affalrs I le thought the subject of dealing with the hA,A ,.u1u mine -resor wa a . matte fo .osde. in Th balunc intetreasiLy-wassamatter for consideration. The contract withthe Government was of a very stringent character, and he trusted that when tho subject was brought before the Government that the company would be dealt with in a just and equitable manner. The terms of the contract were vague and inequitable, and such as ought not to have been made. The question was, when shoudthesubject respecting the profits be brought for- ward,-whether immediately or at some future time? At all events, as a shareholder, he would bring the matter under the oonsideration of the board. He had stated his opinion on this subject merely as a shareholder. (Hear, hear.) itir. FRiriu stated that, although there ap)peared a large balance here in the treasury of the East Mdia Company, yet it was probable they had paid 500,0001 for the company in India. The payments for the companyin India amounted from 120,000& to 180,0004 per maonth, Anud it would be very unwie incaryingon uch ork to aveless than eight or 10 months' money in hand.

CHBrSTLANITY AND BUDDHISM. TO TEE BDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir -The erinteresting papers on thoBtddhisPUg.jl in r,Th Time o April 17 and April 20, indu en me to ask question, through 5 he Times, which I might otherwime as' for ever and obtain no answer. What were the relations of Christiaity and Buddhism to each other in Central a during the middle ages?I It is 'well known that the Nes. torians had spread their form of Christianity very widNel throlaghout Central Asi even into China, abopt the time when tdiouen-thng lived. It is supposed, too, that the resemblance of the Buddhist religios orders to those of Christendom (which perplexed theyman Catholie iissornaries at a later time) may be trad to -the influence of Nestori Christianity. The questonl then arises, if Part of the oran tio of the Christiau church was adopt-ed by the B Eud s may not part of the Christian ethics hav been adopted? Is it unfair to conjecture that te hater BuddhisC of Central Asa is, so to sPeAlca A fusion of N8storiCn Christianity with the ora l Buddhism? Gibbon says that some features Of the story of Prester JTohn have been borrowed from the Lama of Thibet. Is it an improbable conjecture thikt Preter John and the TLma Are'Orally the samO; that the existence of a saceraotal sovereigntY among the Christian trbes Suggested or passed into, the sacerdotal sovereigrl . of the Lsma? I is worth remark that the Buddhism of Centrai Asa is more hierarchical and more ethieda thai that of Siam and Ceylon whil the latter has more of ilia mnytholugial element. It may, too, be mtter fort in y whether the Shamnanism of Siberia Is ah oorMruntddhij or an earlier form of the religon.

VARnw %'OPJO1 t:n LO-D OCHANCELLOR and the LORDs JusTICES of c ~~~~AiPEAL.) 4LIus w3s an appeal from a decree of the Master of the Rolls relating to the validity of a bequest in the will of Thomas Brown, formerly of Harcourt-street, Dublin, dated the 14th of December, 1846. The testator thereby betiseathed to the University of London a sum of 20,OOOZ. uonsols, and the residue of his personal property, " for the unding, establishing, and upholding an institution for in-. t tgating, studying, and, without charge beyoud immediate expanses, ondeavouring to cure raaladies, distempers, and injuries any quadrupeds or birds useful to man may be found subject to, such institution to be within a mile of either Westminster, Southwark, or Dublin." The bill was Sled by the University of London sgainst the executors of the will, the next of kin of the testator, and the AttorneyGeneral, praying that the bequest might be declared valid and carried mto effect. The reason for the suit was that the executors con6idered they could not pay the legacr or the personal estate of the testator to the plaiytiffs wit out the sanction of the Court, as the testator's next of kin inssted that the executors were trustees for thein of all the property included in such bequest, and that the bequest to the pintiffs 'was invalid, inoperative, and void, by reason of e uncertainty of the objects of such bequest. The grounds of objection to the beqr - -, that it was not a charitable bequest within tie statt,e of Elizabeth (sec. 4:, cap. 4), and therefore could not be supported; and secondly, that an animal sanatory institution could not be established without land, and therefore the bequest was void under the Statute of Mortmain (9 George II., cap. 36). The Master of the Rolls held it to be a good charitable bequest, aid the next of kin now appealed from that decision. As it was an appeal from the whole decree, the plaintiff's case was first opened. Mr. R. Palmer and Mr. Amphlett appeared for the plaintaffs; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Cotton for the next of kin; the Attorney-General and Mr. Wickens for the Crown; and Mr. Lloyd and Mr. BaggaLlay for the executors. The LoRD CEAtCELLOR, withort caLling for a reply, delivered the judgment of the Court, and said that where a testator made a bequest for the benefit of the community at vrge it was to ill intents and purposes a charity, and therefore the only question was whether it came %withn the statute of Elizabeth. Upon that point the Court had no Zoubt that a sanatory institution for animals useful to mankind, although not within the exact words of the Act, came within its scope and meaning, as being a charity ejusdem imeris as those there enumerated. To any rational mind he object of the testator was quite as charitable as an institution founded for the removal of the potato disease or other vegetable products useful to man. As to the objection that the bequest 'was void under the Statute of Mortmain, on account of land being required to carry it into effect, the testator had escaped that dificu'ty by giving an option to the University to found the institution either in London or Dublin, to the latter of which places the statute did not apply. Being of opinion that the appeal was without any foumdation whatever, It must be dismissed with costs. Lord Justice INIGHT BRUCE observed that if the appeal were not dismissed with costs a most mischievous piece of injustice would be committed. * Lord Justice TURNER concurred with the judgment of the Court. - Appeal dismissed 'with costs.
ROLLS' COURT. CH&WORRY-LANm ApnTr. 2S JONES V. WVULIAMS. (Before thc MASTE of the ROB S.) :ms was a suit instituted by the plaintiff for the purpose of baving it declared that he was entitled to have an equitable mortgage taken by him to secure 2001. and interest piaced in priority to a subsequent mortgage taken by the solioitor and brother of the mortgagor. It appeared that In the year 1839 a deed was executed to secure, among other things, 5001. to a Mr. John Williams. In 1840, this sum being due to him, John Williams borrowred of the plaintiff the sun of 2001., to secure which and interest he gave his promissory note, and as a collateral security deposdted with him the title deeds of the mortgaged property. rJubsequentIy Mr. Robert Ti'ndaI Williams, the brother and solcitor of John Williams, took a mortgage of the Fame property. Both the Williamsea being dead, the question in thcause arose between the plaintif and their represen- The MASTER of the ROLLS held that the depoeit of the title deeds, although unaccompanied by a formal momorandum, was a good mortgage in equity. Thu only remaning cxuestion, therefore, was whether Mir. Robert Tindal Williams was to be held affected with notice of the equitable deposit. He was the solicitor of his brother, and, prwim4 facie, it must be taken that he was cognizant of the Previous charges upon the property when he took his eocurity. He shcold pronounce for the priority of the plaintiff's olaim his cosb of suit to be added to his mortgage. The usual accounts would of course be taken. Decree accordingly.

CANNOCK V. JAUNCET. The arguments in this case occupied the whole day, and are not concluded. (Before Vice-C(hancellor Sir JoBN STuART.) BRUItFIT V. MORTON. This was a bill for the specific performance of an agreement, dated on the 6th of December, 1856, by which the plaintff, in consideration of 9001., agreed to assign to the aefendant the two messuages, numbered 20 and 21, in Maden-lane, near Covent-garden, and forming the wellknown tavern calied the Cider Cellars, for the residue of two several terms of 60 years and 21 years, for which the plaintiff held the same under leases, of which 38 years and eight years or thereabouts were unexpired, subject to the yearly rents of 1541. and 501. respectively. It was also agreed that the tenant's fixtures, furniture, stock of porter, ae, wine, and spirits, and the other effects in and about the premises, should be taken by the defendant at a valuation, and that the defendant should not object to the assignment by reason of the leases before-mentioned being derivative or under leases. The defence was that the plaintiff held tbe premises comprised in the agreement under an under lease, dated in 1853, which was granted to him for terms which were respectively seven days short of the term then unexpired, and for which the two messuages were granted by the superior leases; and that the upper part of No. 21, Maiden-lane, which was used as a Jewish synagopue, was let on lease to one Levi, and that a breach y Levi of any of the covenants in the original lease of No. 21 would incur a forfeiture of part of the premises comprised in the agreement; the cellars under the Jewish synagogue forming a part of the Cider Cellars. The case, which occupied the vhole of yesterday and today, is at present only part heard. Mr. Craig and htr. Rogers were for the plaintiff, and Mr. Bacon and MIr. Bazalgette for the defendant. (Before Yice- ChancelUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) COX V. BRUTON. This was a suie to set aside a conveyance executed by the i.mtiff to the defendant in 1854 of certain land therein cjSprised, on the ground of his having executed it in ignorance of its contents, and under an error and mistake as to the purport and effect thereof. The relation between the plaintiff and defendant was that of putative father and child, and up to the present contest they appeared to have lived together on temrs of mutual regard and afieotion. The plaintiff's case, which was not based in any way on fraud or undue influence, 'was shortly as follows :-The plaintiff. who is a small farner at Cranfield, in Bedfordshire, had from time to time assisted the defendant by advace of money, and previously to the year 18'54 h enabl the defendant to borrow a sum of money from a Mr. Day, a solicitor at St. Neots, by securing the loan on certain land theretofore belonging to the plaintiff, but the equity of redemption in which was on the mortgage transactions reserved (by way of gift from him) to the defendant. In March, 1854, the defendant wanted more money from Mr. Day,which, however, was refused without additional security. After some demur the plaintiff reed to become collateral security, and ultimately wrote a letter to Mr. Day in these terms:- 51r,My nphew Thmas nito, "Canfeld, March 13, 1854. wants a little more money if yuuwfflbe,oklndastoletblmhavesome I are willing he should har ethe hoinestan, end all excepting my house and garden.

(the total amount of the moneys due) - the other being that now impeached by the plaintiff, co leying the equity of redemption in tho estate to the de Adnnt,Kis heirs, and asins, in consideration of a sum of ',(. therein stated to have been paid by the defendant, the receipt being acknowledged, and an envorsed receipt signed, by the plaintiff. The recital in this deed stated the transaction as a " contract" for "purchase," subject to the mortgage. The plaintiff stated that these deeds had never been read over to him ; that he exec'ated them without understanding their contents, and 1 der the impression that it was a mortgage transaction only - and that he had never received the 601. or any sum of moneiy.Subsequently, in the year 1855, the plaintiff be- l]vig hiself to be the owner, sold a portion of the land, and received the balance of the purchase money (after pa;. nhg the mortgage debt) without any question as to hins Zlfl beig raied by the defendant or by hlr, Day. After this sale the plaintifl by. an agent, applied to 3Mr. Day for tbe title deeds, when he was informed (and, as he stated, for the f,rat time) that he had conveyed the land to the defendant, who insisted on his rights, and thus gave rise to thepresent suit. Several points were urged for the defendant, and, among others, the relation which existed between theparties, as leading to the inference of the deed being a gift by way of bounty, notwithstanding the statememt of tho 501. consideration. It was also attempted to account for this consideration by showing that on the agreement come to by the plaintiff to become security part of the agreement bad been that out of the moneys to be advanced by way of mortgage 501. should be ppliedi paiment of some debts due from the plaintiff. he letter above given was also insisted om as showing an intention in the plaintiff of giving the property out and out to the defendant, and as giving instructions to Mr. Day to that effect. That gentleman had been examined as to the instructions which had been given, but no satisfactory evidence was given in any way to account for his having inserted a valiable consideration in the deed swhlchhad been prepared by him). With respect to no objection having been taken by the defendan' to the sale of part of the property by the plaintiff, he accoanted for this in the first instance by saying that he had agreed to the sale because the plaintiff wanted the money, beig in difficulties, but, on cross-examination, he bad admitted this was not so. The danger of giving facilities to appHcations by parties who had solemnly executed deeds to have them set aside on the ground of their being contrary to their intentions was also strongly urged upon the court. Mr. CAwIRs and M-. PRyoR argued the case for the plaintiff; Mr. ROLT and Mr. KA3ESLARE for the defendant. The VICECHANCELLOR, after expressing his great regret at a suit having been necessary, more especially looking to the relations between the parties, went tbrough the evidence, and without imputing (as, indeed, the plaintiff had not done by his bill) any fraud or undue influence to any one, said tnat he must diecide in favour of the plaintiff, whose case was COnsiStent throughout, and who had evidently executed the deed wder a misapprehension. The deed must he set aside and a re-conveyance decreed.
COUPRT OF QUEEN'S BENCE, WEsTmITER. ARIT 29. TSE QUEEN V. THE VESTRY OP ST. PANflRAS tcungs fn Janco, before Lord CAMIPBELL and Justice WIGxTMAN, ERLE. and CROmPToNx. '.L2ms case came before the Court uoon a demurrer to a return to a mandamus. The mandamus was directed to the vestry of St. Pancras, and commanded them to appoint an auditor of the Poor Law accounts of the parish, in obedience to an order to that effect which had been made by the Poor Law Board. To this writ the vestry made a return in which they set out the several local acts under which they were constituted. To this return the prosecutors of the writ demurred, and thus raised the question whether the vestry were bound to obey the order. Mfr. Tomlinson (with whom was Mr. Pashley, Q.C.) appeared in support of the demurrer; and Sir F. Kelly (with whom were Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. D. D. Keane) in support of the return. L OArdIPBzL, said he thought it would be more convenient if the parties objecting to the order were to begin. Sir F. KELiaY, accordingly, on Wednesday last and this day, was heard in support of the return. T'he order was made under the 46th section of the Poor Law Amendment Act (the 4th and 5th of William IV.. cap. 76), which enacted that it should be lawful for the Poor Law Commissioners to direct the " overseers or guardians" of any parish or union, &c., to appoint such paid oficers as they should think necessary for auditing the acconnts of such parish, &c. The word " guardian" was by the 109th section interpreted to mean any " governor, director, or vestryman," &c. The learned counsel contended that St. Pancras was not a pariah contemplated by the 46th section above cited, it being governed under the powers of a local Act (the 59th of GeorgeIIL, cap. 39) and other Acts, under which the management of the poor was committed to a board of 40 governors, with power to appoint auditors to examine their accounts. He also contended that the order itself was bad, being made in excess of the powers of the Poor Law Board. The order directed that the auditor should be appointed by A majority of the vestry " present and voting" on the question of such appointment; whereas it was enacted, by the 28th section of the Metropolis Management Act, the 18 and 19 of Victoria, cap. 120, that the vestry should exercise all its powers by a majority of those " present." It also contained an article as to the payment of the auditor's salary, which the counsel for the prosecution admitted could not be sustained, as being in violation of a section in the Aot of Parliament. lUnder these circumstances. Lord CAMPBELL said that, as some of the objections were very formidable, the better course would be for the Poor law Board to abandon the order, and make another which should be free from the defects contained in the one now before the Court. MIr. TOMLINSON said he thought he could get over some of the objections, as the order could be brought uD by cer. tiorar., and the parts that were bad could be got rid of. Lord CAMPBELL intimated that all the objections could not be got rid of, and that the Court, if the ease went on, might be bound to give judgment against the Crown. His Lordship suggestesl that a noUe proscqui should be entered. The object, no doubt, was to try whether the Poor Law aBuodalrtd rhad the power to make an order to appoint. an Mr. TomLINsoN ultimately yielded to this suggestion. Judgment was then given for the defendAnts, with costs. MT. o MLtNsON said he was afraid the Treasury would lord CAM^rPBELL said he had no doubt the Treasury would order the payment of the costs when they heard that this proceeding took place by the advice of the Court of Queen's Bench, in furtherance of pubEc justice. THE Q17EN V. EYRE. This was a rule to quash an order of the Essex Quarter Sessions, whereby they had disallowed an appeal against a poor-rate made for the parish of Dedham, and directed the appellant to pay the costs of the appeal, amount. ing to 601. The ground for the rule was that the justices bad acted without jurisdiction. It appeared that the appellant had given due notice of appeal, but had accompanied the notice with an intimation that he should not try the appeal at the next sessions, but that he should petition the ourt to adjourn and respite the same to the succeeding sessions. The respondents thereupon gave the appellant notice that they should oppose such application, which they accordingly did. The sessions decided in their favour, disallowing the appeal, and condemning the appellant in costs. T'he question now was whether the Quarter Sessions had iurisdiction to make the order, or whether they were bound to adjourn and respite the appeal. 31r. T. CnAmBERs and Mr. RODWELL showed cauwe against the rule, which was supported by Air. PAMLEY, Q.C., and Mr. DOWDESWXLL. Lord CA'MPBELL said he was of opinion that there waS no excess of jurisdiction, and that the order was good. A reasonable notice of appeal was given, as required by the 17 George II, cap. 38, sec. 4, andthe sessions were not bound to respdte it. Tne other ludges were of the same opinion.

BROWVN showed cause against a rule for a new trial, and Mr. JOYCE appeared in support of it. The question raised was whether a parol agreement could operate as a waiver of a claim for rent due. The COURT took time to consider its judgment. UUSET AND OTHERS V. BIRD. This was an action of trover and detinue, and for money had and received to the plaintiffs use. This action was brought by the assignees of a man named Young, a bank. rupb, to whom the defendant had advanced 3851. on the security of a bill of sale. After the bill of sale had been entered into Young was sued by Mr. Musket for a debt, and after that writ issued the bankrupt gave a further bill of sale to the defendant to secure the same sum as the last, with an addition of 301. for interest and expenses, no further advance having been made to the bankrupt. By the bill of sale the bankrupt assigned all his goods and chattels to the defendant. This, it was alleged, was an act of bankruptcy, and the plaintiff; as assignees, sought to recover the goods seized under that bill of sale. The jury found a verdict for th plaintiffs for the amount claimed. A rule baving been obtained to set aside that verdict on the ground that there was no evidence of an act of bankruptcy, 3dr. Honeyman showed cause against the rmle, and Mr. Spinls appeared in support of it. In showing cause against the rule it was contended that the facts of t-he case showed abundant evidence of an act of bankruptcy. In support of the rule it was contended that the last deed only carrned out the provisions of a covenant in the former bill of sale. Rule discharged. GORRISEbr V. PERRRI. This was en action on a contract for the sale of 1,170 bales of gambia. The defendants delivered 1,170 packages of gambia, weighing about 601b. each. The evidence at the trial was that in the trade a bale of gambia averaged about 2cwt. The packages delivered were in bags, and loose. In the trade a bale meant an oblong compressed package. Gambia having risen in price in the market, it became an object with the plaintiffs to get as much as they could at the contract price; and it was contended that theee packages were not bales within the meaning of the contract. The jury found that the packages delivered were not bales within the acceptation of the term, and the Lord Chief Justice directed a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff. A rule niei, to set aside the verdict, having been obtained on the ground that this dire -tion was wrong, and also that his Lordship ought not to ive received evidence as to the meaning of the terms of %he contract, Mr. Serjeant Bvles and Mr. Honeyman to da1 zappeared to show cause against the rule, and Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn in support of it.

One of the defendants, however, was Mr. Cobbett, a prisoner in the Queen's Bench, whose name has been so frequently before the courts of law, and claiming as tenant to Mrs. Mosley, the other defendant; he with the aid of his wife Mr. Cobbett, who is equally welU known with her husband at Westminster, advocated the case for the defence - and, in so doing, cross-examined the witnesses at greai length, and with wonderful pertinacity, on aU kinds of points totally irrelevant to the issue, insisted that al the title-deeds adduced should be read in funl, made use of langnage for which he was reproved by the learned Judge, and, in short, as Mr. Justice Williams observed, "with the view of conciliating the jury" succeeded in protractiug the ral of this cause fairly intothe afternoon of the day, it having been commenced at the sitting of the Court. It appeared that the property in question originally belong to Jre, mosoley s husband, who is now dead, but who in-hI& lifetime knew Mr. Cobbett as & fellow prisoner in theQueen's Bench.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER. WZDnNaDnAv. ARnT. 29 SPECIAL PAPER: BISS AND W1PE V. RMXrTr (SitUino in Banco.) This was a special case framed for the puzpose of obtaining the opinion of this Court on the construction of the will and codicil of a gentleman naned Wiltshire Mr. M. Smith and Mr. Hill appeared for the plaintiff and defendant reliectively. The Counr, at the conclusion of the argtment, took time to consider its judgment. THE NEW RIVER COMPANY V. THE LAND TAX COMMS- SIONERS OF OGIAT AwXf LL IN lEBTFOBDSM.I This was a special case, raising the q Cstion whether under the LAnd Tax Act the Now ~River Comp'any was liable to be assessed to the land-tax of the county of Hertford, in respect of so much of the Mew River as sses through the arish of Great Aanwll, and al"o respect of a small plot of ground in that parish belon ing to the company, and two wells, the produoe of which the company sold, at Great AmwelL The pLintiff' contention was that on the true construction of the 57th sec tion of the IAnd Tax Act the company was expressl made assessable in the London district alone for the whole of their property. As to the wells, the argument was that they stood on land in respect of which the land-tax had been redeemed, and were not, therefore, liable on that accoumt to be included In the assessment, wherever that ought to be made. For the defendants it was argued that tho company might well be liable both to be asEessed in London and in the parishes through which the river passed, and that the Legislature never could have meant to benefit London at the expense of Hertfordshiro, the land of which was taken to produce the profits in respect of which the land-tax was chargeable. As to the plot of ground which had been added to the originagproperty, it was submitted that that was clearly smessable to the locality in which it ws situated if unredeemed. As to the wells, it was admitted that if they stood in land which had been redeemed the company would not be liable in respect of them. It was, however, uncertain in the present case whether that were the fact or not, but that might be cleared up before the Court delivered judgment. Mr. Serjeant Byles (with whom was 3ir. Field) appeared for the plaintiffs. Mr. }1 (with whom was Mr. Lush) argued for the defendants. The COURT aso took time to consider Its judgment in this case. Judgment deferred accordingly. (Sietinos at ut Prius, at Guildhali, before Mr. Bairon WATSON and Common .Turise.) The only case of the slightest public interest was not concluded when the Court rose, his Lordship having to go to chambers. We therefore defer our report:

AtSOZYVXT DZBTOB' COURT, Api 29. IN BE JAMES NO1RRPTq WrYT. (Bcfore Mr. Commiqine.r 3VRPRY- This insolvent applied under the Protection Act. He was opposed by Mr. Nichols on behalf of Mr. L Harris, of Dublim, money agent; Mr. Sargood supported. It appeared that in 1851 the iusolvent, then a captRin in the 1 al Artillery, was quartered in Dublin, and whUe thereMr. lTis cashed for him a bRil of exchange for 1721. When the bill arrived at maturity it was not pad, and the Insolvent, who was somewhat embarrassed, was in Beleium. Certain terms of arrangement were offered to M1r. Harris, with other creditors, but some refusing to accept them, the insolvent was compelled to retire upon half-pa. Upon the brealdng out of the Rus6ianwar he obtained an appointment in the Field Train, and served before Sebastopol until June 1855, when he became a major in the Turkish Contingenti which corps was broken up in May, 1856. During his active service he had-paid about 1801. on account of his debts, aud had the Turdi Contingent been maintained he expected to have been able in three years to pay off allhis liabilities. He had lately been appointed a captain in the new Military Train. Some of his creditors had accepted an offer of 4s. in the pound and had given a release of their debts. Mr. Earris ad declined those terms until yesterday, when his attorney was willing to assent to them. Mr. NIcHOLs asked that the insolvent might be r ulred to set dart some portion of his income for the liqtion of his debts. Mr. SAHG.OOD observed that Captain Hill was on full pay, and that it would be impossible to set apart any portion of it, as it was even now barely sufficient to support him while in active service. The ins(. ent added that he had to Drovide himself with an outfit, which would cost him 70L or 801. Mr. NICnoxS submitted that if a man sought protection from his creditors he ought to do eomething if he could for their benefit. Mr. Commissioner MuRpuy declined to make any order, as to do so would only compel Captain Hill to contract fresh debts. The insolvent appeared to have done his best to get rid of his liabilities, and it was to be regretted that Mr. Harris had so long refused to accede to the terms which were offered to him as to the other creditors. A day was named for the final order, and the protection renewed.
POMICE. MASsIo -HovsM-Wiiam Bucklee, of No. 19, Little Wyld-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, appeared before the LouD MAYOR, upon the complaint of the Metropolitan Board of Works," tat he being on the 19th of March a builder, and then engaged in fixing a stove for the purpose of trado in the houseNo. 56, Bishopsgate-street-within, did unlawfull fail to comply with the fzist rule of section 21 of the Wetro. poitan Building Act, 1855, required to be observed as to close fires in such stove-that Is to say, that the floor around the said stove for a space of 18 inches was not formed of materialsof an incombustible and non-conducting nature." Mr. Smith, the solicitor to the Metropolitan Board of Works, attended for the prosecution; and Mr. Edmund Woodthorp surveyor to the citv' of 1ondon, and Mr. Braidwood the principal of the Fire Brigade, were preseni eMAyoSi, LR Y addressing the defendant.-Are you gulty or not guilty ? The efensntMy Lrd, ammerely a journeyman in the employment of Mr. Ev'ans, the ironmonger, and I certinlfv didfinx the stove, but it was under the directon of The LoRD MAYoB.-Thenuou plead " Guilty ?' The Defendant.-Yes, my Lord. The Solioitor to the Board of Works said that of course there was nothing vindictive in the prosecutioni of the defendant; but the mischief likely to result from the want of strict attention to the clauses of the Act of Parliament was of such a nature that the Board felt it to be incumbent upon them to press every case of the kind upon the con. sideration of the magistrates, for the security of the lives of the public. The LORD MAyoR.-This man says that he has been acting under the direction of his foreman. Is there reason to beleve he knew that he was violating this most important Act when he was doing this work? The Solicitor to the MetropolitanBoard.-Yes. He knew that he was tranagressing. We are perfectly aware from a former circumstance that he was conscious that he was doing wrong, and the danger arising from neglect is very great. The Defendant.-I am only employed by others, my Lord. The LoRD bLAyoi.-No doubt of that, but you understood perfectly well that you were doing what you ought not to ave done, and you must pay a penalty of 21. or go to prison for 21 days, and I shall n^fict upon future occa sions of the kind the larger penalties which it is in my power to adjudge. There was another summons against the same defendant, which charged him with the violation of another section of the same Act, committed on the same day ; but, as no evidence was produced to show his guilt, and as he solemnly denied that he bad been &oncerned on the occasion The solicitor to the letropolitan Board withdrew the summons upon the second charge. The penalty wvas paid. Bow-sTmnEr.-Frederic Leroy was brought up for further examination on the charge of utteringa forged check on Messrs. Coutts and Co. In addition to the former evidence, 3L Troznou, Secretary to the Prince de Joinville, was examined. He stated that he resided at Claremont, beit was at Paris on the 20th of April, the day the check bore date. The siguature to that check was not in his handwriting, nor had he authorized any person to sign it for him. It purported to be drawn in favour of a AL Moreau. He knew no one of that name. He had never seen the prisoner before. MEr. lMu1lens, on the part of the prosecution, applied for a further remand, as the pcohee were engaged in inquiries which would probably lead to eome material discoveries in a few days. The prisoner wvas accordingly remanded.

Huddleto appearefor tpe d;sfendantg. luperintendant H*nn_t, C divsion, produced the autority from the PolMce moramissioners for enter. lug the house. He £aid about haltf-past 2 o'4lock yeaterday he went to No. 17, Great Newport street, accompanied by An Anusector aud a constable and found all the defendants there. The shop was fitted uD as a tobacconist's, aod the defendant Gideon was behind the cointer, the other defendants being in front aud about the shop. Having stated who he was, Gideon begged he would keep the thing quiet. He then searched the place, and on the ¢ounter he found a betting-book with entries therein of bets made on various races. He lso found anotherbook with bets entered to the amount of 1,1COl., and the names of the parties against the bets. A number of cards relating to betting and racing were also found, and other eards were therewhich-related to moneys paid.. There was a large sum of money in the different drawers-the total was 405Z., and Gideon took 138g. from his pockets. Witness searched the shop, and looked into cigar boxes, which Gideon told him were all dummies. One of the defendants (Gill) was busy with his betting-book, which was taken from him. The other defendants were searched, and small sums of money and betting.books were found on several of them. Inspector Webb corroborated the above evidence, and troduoed some more betting mateials. *Polioe-consUtableDraper,A326,wentintothe bettiug.offioe, 17, Great Newport-street, at balf-past U o'dlock yeserday. where were several persons presentk and Gideon, who was behind the counter, calledout, " Bets here forthose,.gentlemen. Be as quick as you can, and do not oecapy the office longer thin necessary, but make way for others." Witness went to the office again at 12 o'clock, and saw several persons there. Cards similar to the betting cards produced were on the counter, and he saw one gentleman put down 2Z. for a bet, and Gideon took the money. Went a third time to the house at 1 o'clock, and more persons were present, one of whom asked Gideon what was the lowest he would take, and received for answer 9 to 1. Went again at balf-past 2 o'clock-Gideon and Handley Were behind the counter-and a man said, " Put me down 11. on Hampton at 6 to L" On each occasion Gideon wrote something mn a book when-a bet was made for money. He left the shop and waited outside until the snperiatendent came. Mr. Huddleston mid after the evidence of the last witness it was impossible for him to attempt to contend that the case of Gideon, for whom he appeared, did not oome within the meanng of the Act. Hd Gideon stood by himself it was his intention to have leaded " gailty," and thrown himself on the mercy of the &urt. It was Gideon's first offence, and, thoughnottheonlyproprietor, Gideonwas willing to admit that he had transgressed the laws, and hoped the Court wouldLinflict a 'itigated penalty. Mr. BEADoN asked whether the evidence against the other defendants went further than to show that they were present in a betting-office. The ;colice aaid it did not. Mr. BADO said all persons found in a betting-office were liable to be taken into custody for being there without lawful excuse, Be should content himself with discharging all the defendants, except Gideon. The cane of Gideon embraced the largest amount of betting transactions that had yet come before the Court. The betting business appeared to have been carried on in quite a systematic manner-with bank, betting-books, and partners-and that, too, in Ite of the warnings that had beengto given. He could no. put on a small fine, as the bettinr acts had been carried on in the face of and in defiance of former proceeings and convictions. Government were folly deter. mined top ut down bettingh and it must be clearl; anderstood if pdies were broaght before him after a first conviction he would not put on a fine, but give hard labour without fine. As far as that district was concerned betting. houses should be put down The fine of 50I. was ten inflictd W3CTMST.-The first half of a 61.-note has been reoeived from "Eeter Pickwick" for the poor-box, and an acknowledgment was requested in 2ze Tirncs. WoRsmP-sMRzr-Mfr. PeterJames Knott, landlord of an alehouse in Nortonfolgate, was charged on remand, upon a warrant granted by the Chief Police Commissioner, with keeping a common betting-office upon his premises. Superintendent Mrtin, of the G division, produced the warrant referred to, and stated, that in consequence of its contents he went to the defendant's house on that day week, in company of Inspector Cole)nd other offlcers, apprehended the defendant and other persons, and took possession of several betting-lists and cards relating to horseracing transactions. There was no betting goin on at that time, and the defendant said he was not engased in sach a business and had notlaid a wager for some time past. Inspector Cole threatened to break open a desk he saw there, and, the key of it beng In consequence produced, several horseracing cards were found in it, in a cigar-box. Henry Bennison, a labourer, deposed to going to the house about n In the morning of the 16th inst., and seeing from 15 to 20bets laid. A man named "Jemmy," whom he knew by no other name, took a half-crown from each person, and entered something in a book, giving a little piece of paper in return to the people who paid him the money. He did not hear what the half-crown was given for, nor did he hear any horse named. This occurred behind the bar. The men walked away with the paper, which looked hke a tioket torn from a book. On the ursday he Taw from 15 to 20 half-crowns pawed to Jemmy. hore than one person asked Jemmy how tho odds were going, and he showed them a little black book, with the odds put inpewnil against the horses'nanes. He did not know what race it was upon, but believed it was to come offon the Friday. Jemmy stood at a desk behind the bar, with a curtain drawn round it to concea it. Jemmy was there all day nearly, but would leave occasionally. Witness was there on the Friday also ; there was no betting then, but Jemmy was there all the same. He appeared to have nothing to do but attend to the books. On Saturday, when asked about a horse called Sidney, Jemmy showed him the boolk, and said he did not think he should make any bets that day, hut added that there was 5 to 1 on Sidney. Thompson, 51 G.-I went to defendant's house, and saw Jemmy at the desk; many persons were at the bar making bets, some with Jemmy and others among themselves. The bets were upon horses, and the names Highflyer and Sidney were among those mentioned. Jemmy said the betting on Sidney wzs 4 to 1, and the questioner said " ru take it," and pd half-a-crown to Jemmy, who wrote something in a black book, but did not give him anythine in return. Shortly after Jemmy offered to bet 40 to 1 agaimst Isabel or Jezabei, or some such name, for the Chester Cup, and the bet was taken by a man, who paid Jemmy a half-crown. The defendant was there while he stopped. He saw Jemmy take 82 half-crowns from 12 to 2 o'clock. He also went on Wednesday, a little before 1, and both Jemmy and defendant were there. He saw tvno half-crowns paid to tho former, who entered them in a book. He had not at any time seen Knott receive money, but he was close by JemmT when he did. Knott was acting as the landlord, with his name over the door. Would not swear all the bets were in half-crowns, as some of the money paid was in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and change was given. Inspector Cole deposed to searching for cards or books, and ou a desk inside the bar found a letter addressed to Mr. J. Smee, and dated from lombard-street. This letter re- lated to a bet made on a horse named Pantomime. On calling for a poker to break open the desk referred to Mrs. Knott asked him not to do so, and produaced the key. In it were several books with entries upon various races; with two telegraphic messages from Doncaster and York, relating to races, and several cards relating to races also. Mr. Beard, from Mr. Buchanan's offices, said he would not dispute the facts which had been proved, but drew attentlon to the fact that the defendant was not proved to have been at all connected with the betting himself, and that he had only a short time been tenant there. He found these persons there when he took the house, and had unfortunately allowed them to continue, whichbe now very deeply regretted; he was, moreover, a comnaratively poor man with a large family, and he therefore, under ail these circumstances, entreated that he might be leniently dealt with. Mr. D'EywcoupRT said if he had only had the house six months it would make but little difference. What character did the house boar? Inspector Cole said it was formerly in possession of a betting man named Hale, who kept lists in his window; a stir was made abooutit, and the house was closed for a short time, when Hale died. Hie did not think so much business would be done there without some such excitement. Mlr. I'Evcoxtn said the defendant's not betting was of no consequence, as he allowed it, which was just the same. There was a penalty attached to this offence of 1001., but in condsderation of defendant's position, and that of his wifo and family, the former near her confinement, he should reduce the penalty to one of 251., but only on condition that he gave a strict promise never to permit any such thing in future upon his premises, calculated as such practices were to ruin the humbler classes of the community. In default the defendant would be committed for three months. The defendant earnestly gave the required engagement, and, the penalty having been paid, he was liberated. CLEREXNWE.-JaMes Williams. alias Bmrns, wS again charged on remand with obtaining money under false and fraudulent protences. fr. CosBIstE remanded the prisoner for a week, but committed him upon fve charges, the facts of which have already appeared. TnA ZS.-Charles Wheeler, aged 21, described as a stoker, of No. 20. Langdale-street, St. George's-in-tbe-East, and William Oakes, 22, of Watling-street, St. George's, colour-grinder, were charged with breaking into Messrs. Wegener and Co.'s sugarhouse in WeUclose-square and stealing therefrom two coats, four pairs of trousers, two silk handkerchiefs, and a variety of other articles, value 20.7, the property of an Italian named Nicolo Ponta. It appeared from the evidence that a large box containing wearing apparel and other property was deposited in a corner of a warehouse on Messrs. Wegener's premises, and was in its usual position on the night of Monduy, the 20th inst. On the foilownng morning it was discovered that the premises had been feloniously and hurglarinusly entered in thecourseof the precedingnight, and afterthe thief orthieves had broken open the box they ransacked the whole of the contents and carried them away. The thieves had effectd an entrance by cutting away the woodwork of the outer folding-doors of the wrrehouse and sUpping a bolt which fasened the doors within. On the morning of Tuesday, the 21st inst., about 9 o'clock, two police-constables named Deeble and Savage, Nos. 195 and 212 H, saw the prisoners in the Commnercial-road.east, each carying a bundle, and nowing them to he thieves, watched them and followve them a considerable distance, until Wheeler entered a pawnbroker's shop, while Oakes remined outside, Deeble accosted Oakes, and asked him vhat he had in the bundle, on which he threw the bundle from him and ran aLway. He was soon overtaken, and the bundle was recovered. It contained a portion of the stolen property. When Wheeler came out of the pawnbroker's shop he was taken into custdy by Svage, WhO asked him what he had been pawning, to which hle replied thathe hdpwned a coat, and tht hehad obtained it of his brother.Ma-vage smad that was not satisfactory to him, and he took the prisoner into custody. The coat wa3 immediately given up to the p-olic-constable by the pawnbroker's shopman who had taken it in, and the prisoner wvas compelled, much againsS his will, to return the money he had raised on the article. The coat turned out to be a portion of the wearing apparel abegraote-d from the box.- On .axchig.

JMhITTARY AND NA.VAL INTELLIGENC. Lieutenant-Colonal E. B. Hamley's cosupany of Royal Artillery, 12th battalion, consisting of Majol P. Dickson, 'Captain A. G. Miler, Lieutenant W. G. Brancker, Lieu. tenant B. Lh Foster, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 120 gunners and artificers have arrived at headquarters, Wool. vdch, from Leith Fort. Lieatenant Gordon's company of the 14th battalion of Royal Artillery have also arrived at Woolwich from Guernsey, and with Colonel Hamley's com. pany were yesterday morning inspected by the Commandant and Staff. The latter company is composed of the foUowing officers and men :-Colonel Samuel E. Gordon, in corn'mand; Captain Charles Johnston, Lieutenant W. Gilmour, Ideutenant E. Egan, Ifeutenant E. R. Cottingham, and 140 rank and fdie. Her MAjesty's stean-storeship Buffalo, in temporary charge of Master-Commander Petley, of the Admiralty yacht Black Eagle (Second-master Jones having been removed from the Buffalo), left Woolwich yesterday with dockyard stores for Devonport. The storeship Industry likewise sailed thence with a similar cargo, for the same destination. Yesterday afternoon the troops stationed at Chatham garrison, consisting of the Provisional Battalion (the depot5 of whlih were formed into two battalions, under the respective coesmands of Colonel H. Jervis and Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. Phillips), the Royld Marine Light Infantry, com. manded by Colonel B. Resa and the Royal Engineers, under the oommand of Major C. D. Robertson, R.E., were dxawn sip on Chatham Limes for the purpose of undergoing an inspection by Colonel W. HL Eden, in command of Chatham garrison. The regiments of the Line took up their po§ition in the centre of the colamn, with the Royal Engineers on their right and the Royal iarines on their left. The entire brigade then went through a variety of manceuvres, which 'were performed in a highly efficient manner. The following changes have taken place in the quarters of the several depots attached to the Provisional Battalion, -Ohatham :-d6th Royal Rifles, from St. Mfary's Barracks to Chatham Barracks; 74th Highlanders,fromChatham Barracks to Brompton Barracks; 90th Light Infantry, from Chatham Barracks to St. Mary's Barraksa The strength of the Provisional Battalion is nearly 3,000 men of all ranks. Yesterday morning an inspection of the eavalry and infantry troops stationed at the invalid depOt, Chatham, was made by Lieutenans-Colonel H. Anderson, when the names bf 100 nom-commissioned officers and men, for whose discharge an order-had been received from the War-office, were Tead by Adjutant J. Pope, and each man informed of the amount of pension awarded him. They will be discharged from St. Mary's Barracks this morning. Owing to the large number of men who have recently received their discharge from the Royal Marines at the Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Woolwich divisions, that branch of the service is now much below its prescribed strength; an order has consequently been issued for recruiting parties to be sent out immediately, ad the Lords of the Admiralty have reduced the standard for recruita to aft. 6Olin. Her Majesty's ship Cressy, 80, Captain Richard L. War. ren, arrived at Spithead yesterday morning from the Medi. terranean station. She left Malta on the 16th uit. and OGibraltar on the 7th inst. Having made so long a passage she has no zews. She brought home about 50 military invalids from various regiments at Malta and Gibraltar, and is ordered to Sheerness (where she fitted out) to be paid off. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-Lieutenant C. J. Balfour, to the Princess Charlotte; Lieutenant H. 1. M. Magrath, to the Vesuvius; Lieutenant S. P. Brett, to the Adventure; W. J. B. Hilliard, Henry A. Moriarty, and James Bodie, masters, to tbe Agamemnon; Robert B. Malow, paymaster, to the Leopard ; R. L Sutherland, paymaster, to the Agamemoaon; John J. Willcocks, clerk, to the Leopard.
THE MANSIT AGAIN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I was just about writing to ask you if anything had been beard of the Transit, when my eye caught her name in this day's paper, and I really was quite relieved to find she was in Coruann and was only " in distress." The sole term applicable to the Admiralty for their persistence in selecting such an "tuncomfortable"-that's a -mild word-ship is " pig-headed." For their original sin respecting her there may be some harsher designation by and by. Beforo she sailed I, acting on a slight pesonal experience of her qualities, and on the universal report of othes who knew her better, wrote to you to call the attention of the Admiralry to the consideration of the Transit's Yitness for tue service in whioh they were employing her; but I believe, Sir, that anything which is not a crotchet ,of a land Lord -r a Sea Lord, or has not been memo-randumed and Boarded, and minuted and docketed, hias as much chance of being considered there ns Lord Stafford's piper has of exciting a milestone to the performance of a Scotch reel. She had scarcely left the harbour when she turned the usual source of safety into ^ suicidal implement of destruction; had to ran back again to discharge stores (I wonder what was the cost of damnaged stores on that occasion3, went to sea again after a " Board' had sat on her; and now we hear she is in distress at Corunna, and that she has nearly rolled her masts out. If the Admiralty cannot build transports, why do they not buy or hire thera from those who can ? At her present rate of progression it will take halfa-yer to get the gallant Ngth to China, with their insides " rolled out ;" and the cost per head will be about double the sum which a private or a publio company would have accepted by oontract for their passage. I do not wish to raise any unnecessary alarm among the friends of those on board, for it is to be hoped she will be enabled to claw along the coast of Africa in the Trades without any dsaster; and there is the Cape for her to pull up at and prepare for a fresh start; but if I were en board I should be happy to hear that Her Majesty's ship Transit, on leaving Coruna, was about to steer for Alexandria, and that arrangements had been made for the conveyance of officers and men by the overland route to 'China. Next Sunday, at church, having a due regard for a few gallant friends in that gallant regiment, I shall throw, please God, increased fervency into my prayer for "all -those who travel by land and 'water,"' and thank heaven *Zfat I am HAUD IN TRANSITU.
LARGE BIFLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE Th[ES. Sir,-In my letter to you of the 27th inst. there is an error.which I sheuld feel obliged if you would correct. My 3nvention was brought before the autkorities in 1854, and -mot in 1845, as in the hurry of writing I appear to have stated. Your correspondent " Vulcans" inquies in your paper of .to-dy whether the great wrought iron gun could be rifled .,on Ir. Whitworth's principle. That gentiemian no doubt rill tell -us whether his plan will allow of fn8 being converted from the round bore into the shape he selected, but I believe he has adopted a poly. gonal bore, and, ff so, I apprehend the alteration could not se made without greatly weakening the gun. But, if this be so, there is no reaeon why the monster wrought iron gun should not be rfled on my plan, although J. have strong doubts of this gigantic piece of ordnance ever .proviog.ofmuch real utility, in conssuence.of its enormous ,weight, and the expense invol-ed for its ammunition. Thc experimcnts I alluded to ye6terday were made with ordinary servico guns of the usual strength converted into rfles by merely,planing out a few cpiral grooves less than 1-16th of an inck deep. I was offered by the authorities a heavy block to be bored expressly that the gun might have greater strength,tbut Ipreferred one of the common service ,guns, becausel wiaLed to prove tbe practicabilityof altering any or all of our .present guns into rifles. Although the eons when altered-threw their heas ver shot so -much further than the-smooth boxed, it is remarkable that they had considerably.leas recoil,-thereby proving that there was.no addi'tionasiburstig str in the disch!Arge. The official xeport,just published of the practice with the monster nn'enables me to subjoin Q'e followiug figures, so that a fuitbhrcomprkon may be made between the per-formance of smooths bored and rifled artillery. I suppose the monster gun mayfadrly be taken as an example of all 4,hat it-is posible to do.w7ith guns of the fomuer cbaracter. The offipial zepore states,that the monster has at 56 eleva-tion an advahtage over the celebrated Lancster gun, yet it will be seea belowb that my altered 32-poumder service pgn bad onry about45 yard& less range than its giant competer, although xzF gun was doing the duty of a 50pounder, instead of a 32,ptander, for which it was intended. One very imnortant featuie about my plan ie that it involves no additional expense for ammunition, inasmuch as the extra cost of rsakmag the ,projectiles is so smaU that the saving of powder is an enuiiAdent!- I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

TI9 " GRAT EA STEERN." An old proverb says that "there is nothing new under the su-" With regard to travel abroad, and its ordinary sights this may be true. EveryS~ody knows all about the Crimea. Constatinople, aned the gaudy wretchedness of te East, isag hao}noyed as heapside. Mont Blanc is as well Io1W4n15 P3rose-hilL The Pyramids exhibit huge posters aboub " WVarren's Jet." Ararat, with its unbroken solitude of ages, has been invaded; and even the grim icy caverns of the Arctic regions withhold no secrets. The Las of the exclusve placos is about to be opened to us; and what between correspondents, amateurs, and artists, Hong Kong wiU soon be as familiar as the Isle of Dogs, and the mystery of the internal domestic economy of the Celestial Empire a thing of no account. What remains to be seen ? Where is a man to go for a new sensation or a novel sight ? We think we can say. On either side of the ri7er, inL the midst of those dreary regions known as East Greenwich and Mwilliall, vwhere the atmosphere is tarry, and everything seems sUmy and amphibious, where it is hard to say whether the land has been rescued from the water or the water encroached upon the land, where the shops sell anchors, ship's cables, howitzers, hemp. hammocks, and (other nautical remains, or at most only rise to the elegancies of tarpawling suits, limp sou'-westers, and such like weatherbeaten luxuries,-two gigantic schemes are in progress, which, if not entire novelties, are at least as near approaches to it as this generation is ever likely to witnsss. That at East Greenwich is the manufacture of the great Atlantic Snbmarine Telegraph; at Millwall lies Scott Russell's leviathan ship the Great Eastern. At the former place the visitor (if not also a shareholder) can realize the great idea. There in a comparatively smaU compass, coil over coil, till the eye is pained and dazzled in attempts to follow it, lies the monstrous cable, like the endless snake of the Scandinavian mythology, which was said to encircle the world. But with the Great Eastern steamshiD the case is different. It is difficult, if not entirely impossible, for the mind to appreciate and realiz its imamense hulk at once. The visitor catches no glimpso of it tMi he enters Scott Russell's yard, when, though the ship is stir at a considerable distance, it seems suddenly to shut him in-a mountain of metal across his path-whilo aU around are scattered ponderous masses of girders, funnels, bulkheads, boilers, and machinery, like the dc6ris of some colossal iron world. So vast is the bulk of the huge ark that from no one point, save at the river's side, can the eye take in its whole proportions, arid even then its immensity is so great in com parison with all the notions previously conceived of monster ships that it seems to elude comprehension and weigh upon. the mind-a kind of iron nightmare-a phenomenon, hard and unrealizable. It is useless looking at it, so you try by detais to bring the mind to an approximation of its size, and wander about the yard in search of familiar objects which may restore to their equilibrium your disordered ideas of proportion. On the ground lies something like a field of red iron with a kind of hedge of the same material all round it, and on this you walk until you find it to be the last and smallest of the bulkheads or water-tight compartments, and which in the course of day or so will be lifted bodily 100 feet into the air, and placed In the stern of the ship. Again disturbed in your fancies, you seek refuge in the contemplation of a labyrinth of spokes and stays, a semicircle of iron like the supports of a building-wider across than King Wiliam-street, larger than the circus at Astley's, and which instinct, soon tells you caa be nothing less than part of one of the great ehip's paddlewbeels. By this time, half used to the Brobdignagian world around, the visitor can cooUy walk down a couple of long iron tunnels, which in lightness, cheerfulness, and general population, remind him forcibly of the Burlington-arcade. He knows these are two out of five of the ships chimneys, but is reconciled to the fact and feels that on the whole they are quite what he expected So with a row of red buildings which at first look like house5 and seem the iron suburbs of the vast edifice wbich towers above thema. These are the boilers, though the wildest ideas as to their use seems to pervade the mass of visitors who peep in at the manholes. They are evidently looked upon (especially by the ladies) as mere iron technicalities quite distinct from the ship, though useful in some remote and unexplained degree-probably as models, or as adjunots to the captain's toilette. Each of these boilers, however, weighs 45 tons, and is intended to work at a pressure of 251b. to the square inch. Some have already been tested with the hydraulic pump, with a force of upwards of 601b. per square inch, and proved so solid and faultless in their construction that a pressure of lOOlb. might have been applied with safety. The sight of such objects as these around gradually restores the visitor's mind, and predisposes him for appreciating bulk at least. He somehow expects to find everythinglarge and in keeping with the " monster of the deep," and turns with disappoint. ment from the aspect of tall factories 3nd large trees which are dwarfed to things of paltry insignificance. In this frame of mind if he were told that the steam-cradle, which high ever all in a massive framework of oaken beams lifts up the boilers and other sundries was fixed there for the purpose of hoisting in the ship's telescope, he would take the information as a matter of course, and be in no way surprised or moved by the announcement. But we must go to the ship itself, though none are in a hurry at first to mount its lofty sides. Built near it is a tall framework, or rather a wooden tower, by means of 'which, after toiling up a Rlight of 94 steps, the deck,is gained at last. Here, no matter how much the previous sights may have prepared the ideas, the ship viewed from the deck as one great whole, or rather as much of the great whole as can be seen, for all cannot, is quite beyond the grasp of ordinary compreh ensions to realize. In fact, it is like anything but the deck of a ship, though nothing but the deck of the ship is like it. Some of our readers very probably have been on the roof of the Crystal Palace or Great Exhibition while building. Let them recall either of those scenes-the webs of scaffolding, the groups of forges the cradles and winches, the girders, pillars, and plates, the white-heat rivets, the punching machines, the monstrous screws, and, above all, the bellowing din of by no means distant thunder, and they can form some idea though but a faint one, of the deoX of the Great Eastern. It is very difficult for any amount of description to con vey an adequate notion of a vessel which is 18,000 ton; larger than the largest ship in the world. It may, perhaps, be gained by the visitor who walks to the edge of the vessel, looks up and down the Thames, surveys the domes of Greenwich Hospital, has a bird's-eye viewv on to the decks of large West-Indiamen, and wonders at the diminutive prqportions oI the old three-decker used as the Seamen's Hospital. Or, better still, if he turns his glance from the rivereand peers cautiously over the edge of the space where the upper and lower saloons for the cabin passengers by the Great Eastern are to be constructed. It seems like looking from a housetop into some ordinary metropolitan square, or the court of an extensive French hotel, at the bottom of which-even the noise of the workmen is subdued, for they are -60 feet beneath the spectator. In spite, however, of these aids to appreciation of its size, one must resort to figures at last in order to understand the monster fully. Her length, then, between the perpendiculars is 680 feet; length on the upper deck, 692 feet-within 28 feet of double the length of the height of St. Paul's, and more than double the extreme 9ength of the new United States, serew-frigate Niagara, about which the Transatlantics are talking so mu.ch. The height from the bottom of the ship to the underside of the planking of the upper deck is 58 feet; the eutreme breadth is 83 feet, or as wide as Pall-mall; the breadth across the paddleboxes 120 feet. Alreadynearly 8,000 tons, or 60,000 superficial feet, of wrought iroa have been used in the 30,000 plates of her hulL To secure the,e upwards of 3,000,000 wrsught-iron rivets have been welded in. EGr tonnage is within a few tons of 23,000, She will be propelled by paddle engines of 1,500 horse-power, and screw .engines of 1,800 horOe-power, giving a total of 3,300 horse-power, at a pressure 9f 251b., though, of course, if necessary, she can work t a force of upwards of 5-u00 horses. For throe feet above the watermnark the hull 1s constructed double (on the cellar principle, adopted in the top and bo&tom of the Britaunia tutbular bridge), the inner huH or sh, as it is called, being 2 feet 10 inches apart fromte outer. In this space at -intervals of sx feet, run longitudinal webs of iron plategs, whicL. are again subdividedby transverse plates into spaces of about sLx feet square. This gives an eeermous addition to the strength of the whole frame. At the bottom the longitudinal weibs are thicker, and the spaces between 4iem only abo%t three feet -quare, in order that whesever it is necessary to ground the vessel for any repairs she wll s%pport her own weight without straina,r injury.

AU1 the former will be of hollow wrought iron, except the last or mizen mast, on which, at a height of 84 feet from the deck, will b2 placed the compass. The masts Will spread together no less than 6,500 square yards of canvass, thougb, hang no bowsprit, she, of course, can carry no spritsaiL Three the masts will be square-rigged with iron spars, except the upper topsail-yards. The rigRing will beof wire, andthelarge shrouds of this material will be eight and a half inches in circumference. She will carry 20 large boats on deck - some of them ae new patents, on most ingenious principi.s, to which we shall refer hereafter. In addition to these she will also carry,suspended aft of her paddle-boxes, two smaU screw seamers 100 feet long each and of between 60 and 70 tons burden. These will, of course, be raised and lowered by smal auxiliary engimes, several of which will be fixed on board for working pumps, hoisting .saiis, weighing anchor, &o. Both the little screws wiU be kept in Al respects perfectly equipped for sea and used for embarling and landing the pasengers with alltheir luggage, zc., alongside the wharf or pier, whichever it may happen to be. This will be onerous service, for the Great Eastern is fitted to accommodate 800 frst-lass passengers, 2,000 secondclass, and 1,200 third class,-in all 4,000 passengers; or, if employed in the transport of troops, she can carry, it is said, 10,000 men. She will he ready for launching early in August next, and able to take her irst trial trip to America and back about the middle of that month. She is expected to realize a speed of at Iast 20 miles an hour, or to accomplish the voyage from England to Australia (between which countries she -is to run) in 30 days. Reckoning the cost at so much per ton it is said to be one of the cheapest vessels yet constructed. The arrangements for the launching-or perhaps we should rather say for her being lowered graduaUlly d,wn an inclined plane into the river-are quite as extraordinary and as noteworthy as the vessel itself. At present we cannot enter into the details of the plan, which has been entirely devised by the eminent engineer to whom the whole merit of originating the first great idea of the vessel is due-Mr. Brunel. We may mention, however, that the launch wil be by no means a slapdash affair into the "native element," but a tedious operation which will very probably occupy two or three days. On these points, however, and on some others of equal intcrest, we shall give our readers fuller information as the great ship progreEses towards compiletion.
NEW PEILHARMONIC SOCThFPV. The second concert was even more interesting than the first, and the execution generally more satisfactory. The programme was admirable. The introduction of two very fino works of Mozart, so rarely heaTd as almost to warrant their being placed in the category of "novelties," was a judicious step on the part of Dr. Wylde, and afforded the highest gratificationtohis subscribers; while theoverture and symphony of Beethoven, -which rank deservedly among the greatest achievements of that extraordinary genius, gave equal pleasure. The following is a transcript of the selection in eaenso:- PrAT L Overture-Coriolanus .. . . .. .. Beethoven. Arih "Ah I perfido.. .. .B. .. .. Beethoven. Concerto la 0 mnuor, pianoforte .. .. Mozart. Aria"lselacl'alopianga" .Handel. Symphony in A .Beethoven. par IL Duo Ooncertaute, vioUn and viola .. .. Mozawt. Aia " Va, dit eUe," Madame Ruderadori .. Meyerbeer. Overture-Der FreischUtz .. .. ..Weber. Conductor-Dr. W Ide. The overture to Coriolanw is one of two works (the other being the orchestral preface to Egmont) which by German 2esthetic critics, have been designated " Character-overtures," their aim being to portray, through the medium of music, the most striking features of some human individuality. On being asked by an enthusiastic admirer why he did not compose "character-overtures," asBeethoven had done, Mfendelssohnreplied, modestly, that it was beyond him. Not long afterwards, however, he upset his own theorv about himself in the splendid prelude to .Ruy Btas-just as Shelley, the poet, after lamenting his inability to conduct a plot, wrote the tragedy of Ccnci. In the overture to Coriolanus Beethoven has caught the spirit of Shakspeare's fiery Roman with wonderful felicity. It is, without excepting even fgmon, the finest work of its class which the great "tone-poet" produced, although in consequence of its extremely elevated character it has failed hitherto to attain the popularity enjoyed by several of its companions. The oftener Conolanus is heard, navertheless, the better is it understood, and the execution last night, under Dr. Wylde's direction-which would have been faultless but for a little hesitation towards the end, where the gradual ralkenando issalways perplexing-secured it a chance of appreciation which was not lost uponthe audience. The symphony in A was for the most part a first-rate, performance. Some fewadditional "pianos" in the principal aylgro, a more gradual transition from pianissimo tofortis. stmo m the fugato of the mysterious allegretto, and an occasional dash of " chiar' oscuro" in the finale would have been acceptable; but we must not look for absolute perfection of detail, unless we can rely on a sufficiency of rehearsals, which in London, for many reasons, as every musician knows, is hard to obtain. Such an execation of Beethoven's seventh symphony-one of his most difficult, no less than one of his most original and masterly-as that of last night would stand little chance of being criticised, except byconnoisseursawaketo everyifiness of execution. Anything more dashing, vigorous, and energetic need not have been desired; the schero sndtrio especially were irreproachable, and the loud plaudits at the conclusion proclaimed the entire satisfaction of the room. Mnong the very greatest works of Mozart is the pianoforte concerto in C) minor,-one of those unaccountable things which the richly-gifted musician used to sketch out in passing from town to town, when he travelled for thc purpcose of giving concerts, ar,d commit to paper, on arriving at his place of destination, 'with incredible rapidity. Such a concerto, without reference to the originality and beauty of its ideas, but solely regarding its large construction andcelaborate contrapuntal developement,'wouTd occupy an ordinary composer-any composer now livinga year at least to plan and to complete; but in all probability it took liozat, like other.s of its class-and, among the rest, the unsurpazeable D minor-something more or less than three days. Mozart was accustomed to write down the orchestral score of his pianoforte concertos, and trust to the moment for his own (the most difficult) part, which he would often extemporize, and subsequently band ever to the engraver with scarcely a bar resembling what he had already played. Such was the unexampled fertility of his invention that he was never at a loss; his ideas flowed so fast that if he had bequeathed atenthpartof them tothe world his printed oompositions would, in all likelihood, have been maltiplied tenfold I About the concerto of Mozart a question has arisen of considerable gravity. Several respectable authorities insist that the printed pianoforte part was a mere skeleton, intended by the composer to be flled up (after his own fashion) according to the taste of the performer and the inspiration of the instant. Others assert the contrary; and we believe with reason. To accomplish the former would require a genius and a musical experience equal to thoso possessed by Mozart himseLf; ad hMend&lssohn, who, if anyone could have accomandhed the feat, was just the man to achieve it-the only one, In short that two generations have produced-held the opposite opitnon, and in his pubhc performances of the concerto in D minor always limited his improvisation to the cadenzas. autitorized and sugeested by the pauses in the first and last movements. Thelast time the C minor concerto was layed in England the pianist was Mr. (now Professor) Sterndale Bennett, Men.dlsohn's intimate riend and most eminent disciple, who rigidly adhered to the example of MendeL0sohn and the text of Mozart. Misg Arabella Goddard, to whom its execution was confided last night, did well to accept such precedents as canonicLaL Her per. formaaoe added another to the many laurels she has gamed in the cause of good music, f4r which, youngas she is, she has done wenders, The ornaments and flor itte she introduced were conflnedto the slow movement, and these were not only vecy few, but sanucioned by the authority of Hummel and John Cramer. Thecadenza in the alegro was from Hummel, that in the .sA from Cramer-and both were execated with a perfection that would have cast no discredit on either of those renowed professom Miss Goddard's playing was everywhere masterly and pure, the allegro, the a sste, and the final variations being each distinguished by its proper charmeter, the vigorous energy of the first, the unafected and ehaste expression of the second, and the varied and fanciful playfulness of the last completely realzing the musical picture designed by Mozart, and impartinga falness of meaning to the whole which left nothing to be deesred. Her suoess was the worthier sinee during her entire performance she sppeared mach moro desirous of giving effeot to the music than of drawring attention to her own executive powers, which were made subservient to a legitimate end throughout. The audienee were listening with eer interest to Mozart's admirable concerto, heedless of the ptayer ; and only at the end of each movement the conviction of how perfectly it had been rendered was expressed inan&nimousand enthusiastic plaudits. This was an artistic triumph in the strictest sense of the word. , Of Mozart's Duo Cosceragee and its admirable execution we spoke at length, and in the warmest terms, when the 'work (but recently engraved from the MSS. in the possession of M. Andre of Offenbach) was presented at one of the concerts of the New Philharmenic Society last year. A repetition was warrsnted By its great success on that occaslon; andthe fine performance of 1L Sainton (v,olit) and Mr. Biagrove (viola) insured a new triumiph for this very ingenious and masterly composition, the resusoitation of which from oblivion mnustbe gratifying to AL admirers of The vocal mnusie may be dismissed in a line. Madame Rudersdocff sang the mas-uficent sena of Beethoven with enexzy nnd feeling; and in the arft from Handel's Ar-mid Mademoiselle Solan evinced the jossession of a besautiful cowytyalto voice, which careful training may turn to excellent aozp4t, The overture of Weber, splendidiy played, bquAt. t tii5 #iW Ung sogort to ;M cad withe best effeet -

THE HA LF-PA Y. TO THE EDIMfgOF THE TIMES. Sir,-I Eeo a letter in your impreesion of to-day about the treatmeat of our half-pay officers. I regret that this letter has at this time been addressed to you, for I had hoped your aU-powerful aid would not have been called in til other means had failed; however, it is now too late to * ay a word of caution as to time. The first gum has been fired and the action has begun; let me add a hope that you will not lay down your pen till justice has been done to men who, having served their country-many by length of ervice, many by wounds, all by the best years of their lives-are now deprived of their positions, and made alone to bear the consequence of a reduction of the public expen. These men have the felicity of being between two stools, the War Department and the Horse Guards. It is no use disguising from the British public any longer the fact that, though they may walk down WhltehaU and stop admirin the two magnificent plangers at the JHorse Guards, and come to the conclusion that surely the Commander-in-Chief is a great and powerful man, and that with all this pomp he must have the power to see justice done to oppressed officers and soldiers, yet they are grievously mistaken, since all the poeition he has is that of an Indian king, whose wings we clip, whose power we take away, bat aU the time we sirround him with Royal pomp as heretofore. The authorities at the Horse Guards try even to disguise their position from themselves, and poor deluded officers go there alking this and asking that- the official looks mystenous and vouchsafes an evasive reply. Why? Because he positively can do nothing, and hasn't the pluck to acknowledge his inability ; and -this because there is no love lost between the War -Department and the Horse Guards. Hencoe the real state of the case-the many applications, the sad state of the applicants-is unknown to the only rman who can settle matters either way-the Minister of War; and men whom 'he public would delight to honour are driven empty away, to appeal, in their greatest strait, through you, Sir, to the British public, who are blamed for doing 'that wdich they would blush to do, if they knew that they were l-treating those who have done good service to their cotuntry. These three questions, then, should be answered, and that openly and at once. I care not whether this is done by tbe War Departinent or the Horse Guards - Wbhyis the whole burden of a reduced army expenditure to fall on the Cavalry and Infantry junior lieutenant-colonels and captains, by depriving them virtually of their professions 9 If this arrangemnent just, why do not the Engineers 1;s6tly, 'y should the Guards be exempt from taling their share of the reduction penaltvyI 1. am, :ir, your hulmbe servant, JUs.

Thus, it appea, notwithstanding your eommentary, the Eirt impressions of me formed by this remarkable nma Were not Unfavourable; they were founded on official and p o intercourse, and continued Until shortly after the btle of Meeanee, when Sir Charles N wapier becme aware that I enterinoe,an opInio, in commiton with man others, that his proceedings in Scinds were indefensible, aLnd that thewar which terminated in theconquest ofNScinae was not, asatfist suppod, defensive, but aggresve. No doubt his OProit of ae then changed, and I became ts e object of his anisuadversions ; but I am not theonly instance which could be cited from your works of your brother having, under demilAr circmstanoes, retracted his previously expres4ed opinrons of those withawho- he camebin iontact. One of the most vehement and oftrepeated accHsations preferred against me by your brother is, thaLt I was a proprietor of the Bomb.a Times, that this newspaper was entirely under my control, and that, tking advantage of the circumstance, I was in reality the author of the stron conderanatiou of Sir Charles Napier's; procmeedpg published in thnt paper. Thus, in. vol iii, poge b302, on the 4th of june, 1845, your brother writes :-"'The Bombay, Times bullies about it, andl Willoughby writes forithe Bombay Timms, and, as he is Ontramas bosom friend, is liely to be the author of most of the attacks on le. I detected him ix one, though ho doea not think so." Again, in the same volume, page 306, on thea 12th of July, 1845, he reiterates the charge -I' The .Bomlztay Tmes is dependent on the Bombay Governient. It is Willoughby's paper, and was set on mo headlong." But, as a climax, in a letter addrssed to yourself, dated the Uth of July, 1851, which is published in,our sth volume,pa, ge (32, pou b3tro writes --'Il Bombay knew Wi Ioughby was a proprietor of the Bombay 2imes : there can neither ho doubt nor proof int. Vano times I was told 'tat Buist. attended Willoughby's house daily for orders, and for Willoughby's own articles. All Bombay sae d ao, and his brother-in-law, Dr. Ke Unedy, was certaiy a proprietor, and a frequent contribator. I do not ttink they dare deny this." I do, however, and in the most emphatic maner, dirn to deny this, and in your own langange (vol. 3, p. 805) to declare that "this is simply a fabrication, and without a shadow bf foundation in truth." I never wasa protrietor of the Bombay Tim. I was never pecuniarily or in any otber manner interehted in or connected with the Bomrp y Tiom. Nay, miore, thongh the disclaimer is scarcely due to one who himself so freely resorts to the press, I can assert, without fear of contradiction, that I never wrote or procured to be written a single line in condemnltion of Sir Charles Napier's proceedings in India, either in the Bombazy Times- or in any other newspaper. Under great provocation (for I was frequently myself attacked), I studiously avoided all anonymous controversy in the public press, And I challen you to show to the contrary. But Ishouldnot, perhaps, have deemed this charge worthy of notice were it not for the far more serious imputation raade against me by Sir Charles Napier in anotbhr letter addressed to yourself, dated the 4th of August, 1845. This will be found at page 323, voL iii., and is to the folloving effect :- "I wilnow speak more of the things ina letter whic may be, and which I hope wffi be, reoA by the respectable Bombay clique. I can prove that a letter of 70 pages from Lord Ellenhorough was picked up after the Shannon was wrecked, and a person, seeing it contained important matter, for the cover was gone, brought it to Wnlloghby, who said-'Cive it me;' and then puts it into his pocket, instead of instantly sealing it UP." Itis painful to war agsaint the dead, but you leave me no aiterimative. There I a shadow of foundation for this dishonourable imputation. I deny it in toto. The Shannon was notvve ked, but is stiain use as a lightv vcel in the harbour of Bombay. Having no desire, however,to shelter m7self under this inaccuracsy, I wil assume that it is a mnsprint, and that Sir C. Napier referred to the Hon.

THE WRECK OF THE BIBKENHEAD, TO THEE EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir.-A writer so distinguished as Lieutenant-General Sir Wiliam Napier having adopted certain statements respecting the wreck of the Birkenhead, I consider it a duty which I owe to the memory of my brother, the late Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Seton of the 74th Highlanders, to vindicate what belongs to him in the matter. In doing this I beg to state that I have no wish to detract from the heroic conduct of any officer or private soldier concerned in thatshipwreck. I have only to do with the acts of my brother, who, as the senior officer proceeding to the Capo at the time, was ordered to take tbe command of the troops embark-ed on board the Birkenbead, consisting of draughts from many different regiments, indading one of his Own'21 regiment, the 74th They sailed from Cork in the beginning of January, 1852, and the vessel was totally lost on the 26th of February following, when Lieatetaut-Colonel Setont was drowined. In the " Notice" prefixed to the Bnglish BatteWs and &Sges of ae Peninsula, Sir William Napier says:- 'Forthe soldiers itisnomeasureoftheirfortitude . But what they were their successors now are-witness the wxeck of the Birkenhead, where 400 men, at the call of their heroic officers. Captain Wright and Girardot, calmly, and without a murmur, accepted death in a horrible fona rather than endanger the women and children saved ia the boats." Now, the legitimate inference is, that Lieutenant-Colonel Seton, being the officer in command, either perished before he was able'to do his duty, or, not having so perished, failed to do it. In some correspondence which I have had the honour to have with Sir Wiliam Napier on this subject, Sir William Napier says, "It is for olonel 8eton's friends to make his great self-devotion known to the world." I no - proceed to cite eome of the evidence which I have to that effect, from which it will bo seen that Lieutenant-Colonel Seton neglected no point of duty, and failed in no thought or effort that humnanity and knowledge of the service could suggest. Bad disorder and confusion prevailed in the weck, the blame as a matter of course would have been laid by the pubhc, not againgt Captain Wright and Lieutenant Girardot, but aganst the officer in command; and so, on the other hand, it is but just that the same officer should receive a proportionate degree of credit, when, as a servant of the public, he discharged his dutv faithfully and died at his post aS truly in the service of his country as if he had fallen wthen leading those treops to battle. I am. Sirsvonr mc. tsnnatnhttAt; DAVID SETON. H,dinburgh, April 27. L From the offlcial letter of Captain E. w. C. Wright, 91st Reg ient, reporting the 10Es of the Birkenheod, dated "Wimon's Bay, March 1, 1852":- " The sea was smooth at the timo, and tho vessel was steaming at the rate of S8 knots an hour. She struck tho rock, and it penetrated through heA bottom, just aft the foremast. The rush of water was so great that there is no doubt that most of the men in the lower troop-deck were drowned in their hammocks. The rest of the mnen and ali the officers appeared on deck, when Major Seton caUed all the offlcers about him, and impressed on them the necessity ofpreserving order and silence among tho men. He directed me to take and have executed whatever orders the oommander might give me . , .. The order and reularity that prevailed on board, from the time the ship skuck tUI she totally dippeared, far exeeeded anything that I thought could be effected by the best discipline ; and it is the more to be wondered at, Feeingthat most of the soldiers wAere7ut.a sh&ort time in the sorvice."-See The 2. Extract of a Letter from the Right Hon. the Secretary. at-War, to Mr. D. Seton, dated " War-office, May 24, 1852";- " . . . . . I am sorry to say that no fnrther par. ticulars have reached this offlce beyond the frs official report. That report, as well as all the acoDunts which have been given in aU private letters, bear a concurring testimony to the noble and self-devoted conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Seton, who, being the commanding offlcer on board the Birkenhead, must be conidered hy all military men to have onginated by the authority which he had acquired, and to have stimulated by the example wvhich h met, that display of discipline and self-devotion which the troops, without exception, exhibited on that melaniholy occasion. "W. BEHESFORD." .3. Testimony of Mr. Charlee K. Renwick, R.N,, engineer of Her Majesty's ship Birkenhead:- "That he (Mr. Renwick) remained on the poop deck-, standing close MeAde Colonel Seton, tillthey were all thrown off by the final lurch of the ship. That he observed Colonel Seton in the water near him, and it appeared that he was seized hold of and dragged down by some of the men, who Iwere alinging toone another and struggling around in sUch naInbers that it was difioult to escape their grasp.

EQUALIZmTIOx OF THE POOR-RdATE A pablit meeting of the raepayer% of St. Gear e's.in.the1 ELast and the adjoining parishes was held last evening at thoGeorge Tavern, Commercial.road, to consider the Vro. priety of petitioning Parliament for an equalization of thG poor-rates throughout the metropolis. The Rev. G. HL w'GIL, having taken the chair, obir served that the subject which the meeting wAS invitedi to consider was one that deeply conoerned both the ratepayeand the pauper. The inequality in the pressure of the poor. rates on different districts of the metroolis was a grievaaon that called loudly for redreas. When the Bishop oi London and Mr. Gladstone some time since visited the easterly part of the metropolis, they expreaet it as their opinion that the residents of the West.end of London ought to contribute towards supporting th poor of the East-end, in order to relieve the unequal pru. sure to which the inhabitants of that portion of the metro. polis were subjected. Everyratepayer of the district wows. at once acquiesce in that opinion. He himself 1ai paid as much as.5s. in the pound for poor-rates, and it was fallacious to look for any diminution of thlslegal impost by means of charitable contributionx The only practicable mode of lightening the burden wa* toequalize the tax throughout all the parishes of the metropolis. As this wasa question wholly unconneed vith political or religious views, he hoped to have the sup. port of men of all parties in his efforts to carry out tliw object he wa anxious to attain. He had iavited Mr. Han. bury, the newly elected member for the county, to presido on the present occasion, but that gentleman was of opinion that somo one locally connected with the district snould discharge that duty; but both that gentlema3 and Lord Grosvenor had promised to give their mosb cordial support to the movement in the House oE Commons, and they advised that Parliament should b* petitioned to pass a biU to afford the relief desired. Mr. W. GILBERT, of Kensington, after entering into a, statistical detail, with a view to show the great inequalitX of the poor-rate, in the different parishes of the metropolis5 moved the foUowing resolution:- "Tbat this meeting isof opinion that the poor-atle assessnent Jo every parih lnloondon ought to be equa,tl Ar. WILIsA.ts seconded the resolution. Mr. G. L. HuTCHn sox sid, he had been endeavouring ever sinee 1829 to impress upon the public the necessity of this measure, and the only objection he had to the resolu. tion was that it confined its operation to London onlThe poor belonged to the country at large, and not mereZ to London. He therefore moved as an amendment that theword " London" should be omitted, and the words " Eg. land and Walese be inserted in the resolution; which wa* seconded by Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. BnoorE said, he wzas iltogether opposed to the pro* sent movement, believing, as he did, that by degrees thea whole parochial system of the country would be destroyedt by it. They would commence by union rating, then proceed to district rating, then to metropolitan rating, aud, finally, they would arrive at nutional rating, which wouldt be nothing less thin centralization and coercion. (Cries CC "No! no!') lir. A. S. AYTION, ML., rose for the purpose of tender; ing a piece of advice. They had met to discuss a practical question, namely, how they were to deal with the assess. ment of the poor of the metropolis; but, if they travelled, beyond that question and entered into a discussion as to howthey were to deal with the poor of all England, they would, be embarking on a matter with which it would be utterly impossible for them to deal. The subject was beset witb difficulties, and was one which required full investigation. He by all moans advised the meeting to confine their efforts to the question as it affected the poor of the me-. trowolis only. The amendmnent was then put and negatived, and tht original resolution was agreed to almost unanimously. The meeting was afterwards addressed by Mr. Baddeley churchwarden of St. George's-in-the-East, Mr. Fowler; secretary to the Metropolitan Association, Mr. Crellins member of the Board of Works, Mr. Charles. of lVapping, the Rev. Mr. lrtCall, and others, and the following petitioa to Parliament was adopted. The petition ol the undersigned showeth Tatvae.roasose of the. poor of London ce eithbe alreoadyloaseff in the snbtrbe, or are being driven from the West-enl and city bS various cauase to take up their residence there. ' Thxt a very large ProprtUo o* thwe poor are now living in the eatern parisbes of the metropolis. 'That in oansequens ot this Yur petitionsra. the ratepayerscf those di.,trsoed ditricti are day becoing mre e more impO. verlsbed, the poor-rates having during the last 10 yeas been donb[le4 in amount, and the number of Paupers having inerealed threefold. "That we re now paying on the average 4s. is the poad poorraE' while the richer and more fatourably situated parishes are not pa5inc more than one-sixth of that smount. "That if the rate were equalzed on Oen uniform aa'ena throughout London. it would not be mnore than Is. in tie pound pet annum for all ; and if every descriPtion of property from which pan' perism may incidentally arise were equaly rated it would be o0s1&i3ft" bly less than that amount. " Your petitioners. therefore, humbly pray Your hon. Home to tF inch mesures as may relieve them from aabmrdea too beay for thmhto bear, and to pass anAst toequalize the rateand thl aseesment for the poor throughout the metropolis.` A committee was then appointed for the purpose ot carrying out the object for which the meeting had been convened. Mr. AyRToN, in moving a vote of thanks to the chairma (which was carried by acclamation) for his able advocacy, not only at that meeting, hut bv his letters published in The Times, of the cause they all desired to see SulCcesD ful, took occasion to observe that the proper course to be r ursued in Parliament in reference to this subject wouldb be not the introduction of a Bill in the first instance, buft a motion for the appointment of a committee to whom thv whole uestion shonld be referred for investigation. ThO JZ6v. CIRMAN having acknowled:ed the o-- ment the meetinY terminated.
REvrvAL OF OLD REPORTs ON CnX=A.-Yesber day were published a report on Hongkong, one on Chusan,' and a minute on the British position and prospects in China, by Ir.

Martin on the colon,gof HongkOng, ana other despatoheg on the same subjeeL ahe report on iong. kong iu dated July, 1844, and is now reprinted, for obviona reasons, by order of Parliament. It appers that Mr. Mtsr. tin's opinions in 1844 were ver unfaourable to the reten. tion of Hongkong, on the ground of Its inslubrity, the improbability of raising a local revenue, and its inutuisy. as a commercial entrep6; but Governor Evis, rwho wi appealed to by Lord Stanley-then at the head of the Colo. nmal-office--endeavoured to show that Mr. Martin's statements were partal and axgrated, and expreeseq an opinion that he wrote under a feeling of strone prejudice, founded on apprehensions for his neraoni health, rerding which he was remarkably sensitive.
