i,1R JOHN PAKRINGTON's EDUCATION BiILL.
K) -At a bi'.ERTING of a Committee of Friends of Voluntary duucation, appointed in London On the 6th of May, 1853, held at 33, Moorgate-street, February 25 1G57.
ANGUS J15N}ilX S, REqt., in the chair, It was resolved uanimously:
1. Tnat, with an undiminished interest in the great work of popular efecucaladvnces,d wtthais o°mamnititee c¢annottbut expre3e their entire dissatinfaclion with the Bill introduced by Sir John Pakingion into the fMoose of Commons.
2. That this Committee renew their protest against legislative interference of any kind wlh the education of the people which theyagain afirm to be the business of the people themselve3; while they object to this Bil in pastlcular.that it takes amet injtuious and unworthy aim, since it neither contemplates the extension of popular education nor its improvement, nor seeks to grapple with any of the acknowledged Impediments to its progress, but (adopting the worst of all the plans of the Committee of Council-the capitation grant) merely proposes to pay money with a tavish hand to oxisting schools, without any inquiry whether they want it or not, or whether it may be productive of evil or good.
3. That, in proposing to throw this hurtful and, ultimately, enormous expenuditure on tke Poor-rate, the promoters of the Sil mare seekliug after a school-rate in disguise and in the most offensive and mischievous form. The Committee, therefore, repeat their often-expressed conviction that a school-rate is at once unnecessary and inexpedient. unfair in social pressure, irritating in civic life, offensIve to conscientious feeling, discouragng to parental virtue, and fatal to voluntary effort; and add their belief that these evils wi exhibit themselves in an aggravated form when the school-rate is ldentifled with the poor-rate.
4. That, in the j udgment of the Committee, the proposed adjustment of "the religious difficulty" by this Bil is altogether futUe. Since. under it, the rate will be applicable to aU variqties of reigious behef represented by existing schob is, however antagonistic ad oontradictory; while the proviso. thatno "distinctive religious formulary" shaU be taught, except at a specified hour. when tho attendance of children on whose part objection is raised shall not be compulsory. avails nothing towards the relief of the difficulty hence arising. On tho one hand. it is mere illusion to pretend that, on this plau, the rate would not be applied to religious Instruction since, whatover sugorta a school, manifesily sp ports aU that is dxone in it; and, on tbe other hand, it is no less faIlacious to imagine that such a withdrawment of religious formularies watld annul the religious teaching of the sechool; idnce, wherever this Is seriously and effectivse given, it must leaven the entire educational process. If. however, it were in any case otherwise, the rosult would be, that children objecting to learn the "distinctive religious formuIar' (of whom there might bmany) would receive no relgious instruction at al.
B. That, in the Judgment of the Commnittee, the local and permissive character of the Bil, while diini shing its immediate pressure, does not mitigate its objectionable aspe since it is evidently and avowedly a mree expedient 'o insinuatte thtn etnd of a wedge, whichtheparties who hold it are determined to drive home.

Emigration To Canada.
EMIGRATIOA TO CAYADA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I send a copy of a letter received yesterday, with no other alteration than correcting its orthography. The wrtiter is the son of . carter, a tenant of mine, who, at the time of his emigrmtion, 16 years ago, had a family of six children to maintain, the eldest about 18 years. Hs ordi. nary wages waer about l0s. a-week.
The contrast between the actual position of the family and whbt it would have been had they remained in a country redundant of labour is practical proof of your kindnessntpointingthe attention of all who find employment difi. cultto obtain to countries wheremnastersfeel difficultyin pro. eving workmen. Isent out some years ago two young meh to Australia, one of whom is doing extremely well; the tther told his father they would not hear of him for ten years, nor has he been heard of.
Canada is so healthy and so English in all its social usages that it seems most suitable to Englishmen, and if you could find space at this busy time to mako these facts known throughout the length and the breaath of our land by inserting them in 7he Times, many might be awakened to a knowledge of how industrious sober menmaybe sureof fina. ing happy homes. My personal knowledge of the family to which the writer belongs justifies entire confideace in the truth of what is stated. The letter is addressed to their old master.
I am. Sir. vour obedient servant.

"We are all doing very welL We have lived together or within a few miles of each other ever since we came to this country, till about three years ago. Since that time we have never been all together, though we see one another sometimes. William, Harriett, and Jamesareliving150 miles hence; Barriett moved three years ago; Wiliam and Xames moved one year ago. This is a good country for men and girls 'who work out, for they are very scarce and wages high. Asteady single man will getfrom 301. to 401. a-ear and board and washing; and a married man, who boards himself, will get 50L. a-year, house rent free, and keep for a cow. Men who work by the day get 3s. this time of the year; insummer4s.; inhayingtheyget5is.; inharvest8s. Den whLo work by tne day get their board in this countxK. A good girl will get 12L a-year; a school Jniss 51. a mont
but she would have to board herself. Carpenters and blacksmiths' wages are very hih. It ig good times for farmers now, for grain is high. Wheat is worth 7s. a-bushel; Indian corn 4s., oats 2s., barley 5s., and potatoes 6s. Father has been renting farms these 12 years, and is doing very well. He bought a small placo lasb year; there are.50 acres ; he p aid 2001. for it; it is lGO miles from where he now lives - there are 12 acres cleared, a house on it, and the rest is woodland. 'His time is out in a year where he is, and then he intends to move to his own place. He has two horses, two colts, four cowvs, and one yoke of oxen, 30 sheep, aud tarming utensils. Beis worth more than 4001., and mother has enough to do in her own house. William is married, and is now living on his farm. He has 100 acres of land, 45 of which are cleared. He is worth several hundred pounds. Harriett is married to an Englishmana steady industrious man, who owns 200 acres of land. They have four children. They are living on their own place, and he is worth 1,0001. John is a shoemaker, but that is a poor trade, so he quitted it and went to farming. He was married three years ago. It took him some time to learn his trade, at which he worked three years, so be is not so wel off as some of us. He is married * has one little girl, and is worth 1001. James was married three years ago. They have three children; his wife had twins. He has 100 acres of land, and lives on it-ten acres cleared, the rest woodland, but he is clearing it up. Ho is worth hard upon 500Z. Georgo and Thomas live at home, and they go to school in winter. George is worth 1O0, and Thomas I don't think will leave home. lNow, r have told you ab-out the whole family but myself, and that I will tell you after a time. We have a railroad which rans right through Canida, and then from Canada to New York, which is M0 or 700 miles. It goes close to the place where father lives. Canada is greatly improved since we first came here, and the stock is greatly improved also. We had a very hard winter last Year, and a dry summer followed. so that crops were hght. I bought 100 acres of land three years ago, and then I went and lived there, except it was in harvest; then I used to go down where father and mother lived, and worked out. In 1855 1 made 221. 10s. in three months. In 1856 1 made 241. ic three months and a-half, but I don't expect to do as we}l as that again.
" In I8r5 Imade 141. in 1S days. I was cuttingwheat by th acre. Another man and me have bought a threshing. machine, of 8 horse power. We have to find four horses and the farraers have to ind the rest. We shall kave lF per 100 bushels. Wiliam and James had a machine, and they made 200O. in four ixonths cleas of all expence. Mh place is nearly all woods, but I am getting some cleared and I am worth 3501. I kave told you all I can thik of at present, and hope You wili excuse my bad learning, which is my own fault. XWe long to hear from you. Tke people here are very kind to us, and we all like Canada welL"

Sir,-As yoe have evinced so much interest in the condition of the vast number of unemloyed workmen who have lately assembled in the eietropolis, and have suggested the advantage eef their emigrating to the colonies, where employment is abundant and wages high, the directors of the Canada Company forward the enlesed circular, which has just reached. their hands, thinking you may deem it deserving of a pine in yonr columns. It is addressed by the Minister of Agieculture in Canada to the wardens and other officers in tLe various counties in the province, requesting theor to furnish such information as to the state ef the labour-market in their several municipalities as may ensi1e the provincisa Government to point out to emigrants immediately they arrive the locality wliere employment awaits them. It is needless to enlarge upon the importance of eh information te the emigrant, whose means generaUy ate barely more than wdicient to defray the expenses of his passage; but it will be a great encouragement to him to find that facilities for obtaining immediato employment are pre. paring for him in the colony.

To The Editor Of The Times.
To THE fDZTOR OF THE TLVES.
Sir,-Another terrible colliery explosion has occurred. I hope you will grant me space in your columns to make a few brief remarks on the causes and means of avoiding these frightful explosions of firedamp.
The safety of some mines is intrusted:to ventilation alone.
This appears to have been the case in the one at Barns. ley, for we are told that "the draught was so great as to nake it impossible to carry a naked light along the maiu galleries," though "naked candles were used in some parts of the mine." Yet in spite of this the mine became fiUed with firedamp.
Ventilation alone is, therefore, fallacious as a safeguard,
We have, then, nothing but the Davy lamp to trust to; but the "Davy" is a most imperfect instrumnent. The gauze with which the light is surrounded transmits at the be. but a feeble ray, and after it has been a few hours in use, and has become foul with soot, the light is so dim as to be insufficient for the miners' purpose.
Hence the great repugnanco which the miners entertain towards it. Hence the many tricks which they play with it, and the continual evasion of its use.
And this is the fruitful cause of all these numerous wei. dents. There is an "improved Davy," coustructed with a glass bull's eye, but it has the disadvantage of throwing only a focal light, sad therefore of confusing objects within and beyond its focal length. It is single, and so affords no secu rity against the common miner's trick of lighting his pipe by sucking the flame through the gauze. It is expensive, costing 12s. 6d., and is not in general use.
I have had a lamp constructed which I believe avoids all these defects.
It has been lately submitted to the Society of Arts, and pronounced to be " no doubt, safe enough," and to " give a fair.light," which are of course the essential conditions. It has a complete double caue of gauze, with windows of mica -a substance which will not, like glass, crack under intense heat.
It is protected by a frame and lock, and so cannot easHy be tampered with.
I have no intention whatever of seeking to derive any pecuniary advantage from the invention, but I shall b3 amply rewarded if it contribute to the great end of diminishing the dangers of coal-mines.
Its cost islOs., that of the common "Davy" 7s., and the common " Davy" can be altered into it.
I shall be happy to furnish any one who is interested in the subject with the details of its construction.
I shaU very likely be told that there is nothing new in the lamp ; that a0l these things havebeen thought of befor &ac. I care not for the merit of originality. My only object is to place in the hands of miners a safe lamp, and one which they will use.
If you can aid in this design, I am confident that you will do so.
My lamp is now being tried in a coal-mine in Derbyshire, but in a case of such urgency I am unwilling to wait for the report, feeling very confident myself that the essential conditions are attained in it.
I am, Sir. your obedient servant.

Sir,-On Fridlay last a cask of beer was brought to my house, and a half sovereign tendered in payment. The man, not being satisfied with its ring, put it in his mouth and bit it, when to his suIrprie it broke into two pieces; he therefore returned it to thTe servant, refus'n to take it. Since then I hiave had the pieces testd, eand ffd that the half-sovereign was a good one.

* EASTEBN COUNTIES.
The half-yearly genera meeting of this company was held *.esterday at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate-street; Mr.
lph Waltesinthe chair.
T he report of the directors, an abstract of which has already appeared in 217e 2lTma, was considered as read.
aPhe Ckuflst mid that in rising to move that the report and accounts be received and ado ted, he had much pleasure in congratulating the meeting that they had better prospects before them. Everything had been done during the gone half-year for the benefitof the company as far as the directors could devise plans for that purpose. (Hear, hear.) They might have erred, but all that had been done, he could safely say, was with a view to benefit the sharebolders. Tlhe report exhibited on this occasaon a great deal more than any former report ever did. It contained the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. (Cheers.) The first question of importance which ordinarily occurred to the proprietors was, had their'recoeipts increased idurin the past half-year? The accounts showed that they ha
increased. But it was one thing to show thsttheir receipts had increased, and another thing to show what had been done wish those receipts. (Hear, hear.) He believed the accounts represented what had been done with everyshilling .that had been received. The gross earnings were 717,8W., the charges on the debit side of the account were 374,3321., leaving 34,52. for division between the three amalgamated companies. The necessity of the interests of these three companies being anslgasnated was made apparent by the fact that 46 per cent, did net pay the expense incurred in obtaining the traffic on the tree lines, and until the amalgamation was completely effected there could not be a correct and proper reckoning so far as the Eastern Counties Company was concerned; for when the expenses eiceeded 46 par cent. the lo;s fell exclusively on the shareholders of the Eastern Counties Company, the result being otherwise as regarded the Norfolk and Eastern Union companies. Thus the dividend might benefit the two latter companies, while it
night not benefit the shareholders of the 13stern Counties Rlaihvay. It was therefore absolutely necessary that some
epsehould b taken to remedy that great inconsistency of the three companies. The state of the capital account had engaged much attention. The directors felt that its increase threw a weight upon the proprietors which ought not to be submitted to. It impaired the general usefulness of the company and impeded its general credit in the market. They ought to avoid asmuch as possible increasing the capital account (cheers); and it would be seen thlt the real increase for the half-year amounted only to 9,3241. With regard to the mode of conducting the business of the company the object of the directorg had been to reduce the expenso of the management without impairing its efficiency. Mfuch had been effected in this way by the unwearied exertions of Mr. Love. (Hear.) Thedirectors had also been anxmously engaged in layig down some sound general principles for the better and more efficient administration of the internal affairs of the company.
Several important changes had been made. Tnhere
l _A 1_ _ - I I .
- - iucisron maue in tle stores department, which he believed would work beneficialy. There had also
ben an alteration made in respect to the district superintendents. There were originally eight in number; but the districts had been re-arranged, and now the work was efficiently carried on by four, anda saving of 1,0001. a-year was thus effected. With regard to theexaminationof registerand dividend account, lie had compared the amount with the stock ledger accountkept with ever shareholder, andho found eaca and eveai' account strictly correct. (Cheers.) The next subject to wvhich he would caU attention was the permanent way department. It was recommended in last year's report that a yearly sum of 15,0001. should be charged to the revenue account to meet the large balance due for the outlay on the permanent way, but the directors thought it advisable to increase that aniount to the sum of 25,0001. annually, until the whole atnouatwasextiaguished, which would be effected in aboutf2veyearsanda-half. There was little to be saidvith regard to thelocomotivedepartment, the printed statement of Mr. Sinclair the locomotive superintendant, being'beforethe shareholders. That gentleman hadgivenuniversal satisfaction since he entered intothe service of the company. There wasone point connected with this department to which be would for a momentrefer. Mr. Goochi, the late superintendent of this department, claimed 7,40h1 14s. 8d. As to the origin of the claim he would say nothing, but, in regard to its settlement, he begged to state that the directors, having been assured by their legal advisers that 3Mr. Gooch, in point of law, had the adiantage of the company, they thought it better to settle the claim in an amicable WaY rather than be involved in litifati Accordingly, acting under the advice of their s the directors agreed to pay Mr. Gooch 6,0001. in full discharge of all his claims. As to passenger fares and season tickets, this was a difficult and an important question, and had created much discussion out of doos. The object of the directors was to combine the comfort and convenience of the public with the interest of the shareholders. So far as the new tariff of charges had gone nothing had been lost to the company, but if a better tariff could he suggested the directors would be quite zeadv to adopt it, for they did not profess to be infal ible. With regard to requiring passengers to show their tickets, it was a system acted upon y other railvays without any objection. What objest could the directors have in cauming unnecessary annoyance to their customers? But the fact was that persons were known to have travelled on the Eastern Coantieg line for 17 months with old season tickets. (Cries of "Shame ") The directors wished to give as little trouble as possible to their customers, I uthewas fuDypersuaded thatthe system mnnt. ennt*.;n-nlI
in oraer to protect the interests of the shareholders. With regard to free passes this was a matter which had attracted
much attention. Why free pa,ses should be given ho could not conceive; he therefore felt it his duty to put an absolute stop to i freo Passes given for other than business purposes m connexion with the company. (Cheers.) With regard to the connexion of the company with cabs, the directors had before them fuU evidence of the impossibility of a rallway cornpany being cnabled to aive the neces3ar
attention to s-ch a business, determined to disaose of their stock, and, contrary to all expectation they l.ad done so without any loss.' In regard to the coal traffic the meeting were I'Ware that there existed traffic Arrangements with Messrs. Prior and others of an exceptional character. These would terninate on the 30th uf June next, and for th-s future the directors Were determined not to grant exceptional' rates where the same conditions as to transit existed; but'to treat with all parties on a fair and eqtal

pul the shareholders do*n to the very ground.. (Cheers,) The next topic he wouldz btioe was the Colchexter, Maldon, and Pit6ea line. Much to. the surprise of the director; the proprietors of the East Suffolk Rsilway had promoted this schemeo in opposition to their Colchester and London line. Whether they would succeed beforea Parlismentary eommittee or niot was uncertain. The contractors alone were the parties that oould be benefited by such an undertaking. (Cheers.) The ptblic coald derive no possible, advantage from the scheme. As to the London, Harwich, and Continental SteamFacket CompDy, whose boats were to ply between Harwich andthe continent, he would simply observe that, as far as the EasternCunmties Railway Company could accommodate any ether eompany, and at the same time bring traffic to their own line, it was their duty to do it
but the meeting might be assured the directors would not enter into any arrangement that would bo detrimental to their Interests. In eonclusion, he expressed his hop And confident behef that good. times were comin (eheers)'
and that there was soraething looming in the future that would benefl.t the ahareholders of this great and extensive undertaking. (Cheers.)
Mr. RmL1Y seconded tho motion. He had been grieved and pained to find that a company possessing such advantages as those possessed by the Eastern Counties should, from misconduct and bad managemont, hitherto have been unable to pay a good dividend. Mhe report which had been presented was the most honest, the most satisfactory, and the most instrucetive report they had ever received.
(lI;li jy congratulated the meeting on the favourable views held out to them by the report as to the future pro-
spontseaof the company. H.ealso spoke at coniderable length I onL thfe EAst Suffolk Railw&# scheme.
ltr. Lovz suggested that the discussion of these subjects Phoild be deferred to a future day. (Hear, hear.) No goQd copliId result from tho ,discussion of them, now. (Heartihbar.) With regard tepawsscger traffic tbe directors advocated the principle oa uniformity in the ratis of mileage. It was found, that preferences had been given at some places, while exorbitant charges had been jm. posed. at ether plaees. Privileges were given, forinstan
to persons travelling on market days. It was deteruined that that preference should be Abolished, and to adopt a uniform rating all over the line whero the Act of Parliament did not interf5re to prevent it.
la. MALNys remar'ked that nuder the auspices of their chairmau and of Mr. Love tlhe Eastern, Counties Railway Company had entered upon a course of reform, which would prove beneficiasl to the proprientEors. ft, ihc
After some further discussion of tho different topics presented by the report,
The moSion that the reports and accounts be received and adopted was put and carried unanimously amid loud cheers.
In answer to a question by Mr. Wilcox,
The CnA.nWt said that the dividend of s. per share for the hal-year had been fairly earnedl during tre byg one half-year, leaving a balance of in hand. (Cheers.)
The meeting then proceeded to the election of two directors, in the room of the two directors who had retired by rotation. The names of the gentlemen put in nomination were Mr. Broadbent and Mr. Packe (tbe two retiring directors), Mr. Norris, Mr. Haynes, and Mr.Mayhew. On a show of hands the majority was declared in favour of Mr. Norris and M1r. Packo, and those gentlemen accordingly returned thanks.
The meeting then separated.
SOTH-EASTERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at the Bridge llouse Hotel, Southwark, the Hon. J. Byng in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Tmes, was taken as read.
The CHAnxAtN, in moving the adoption of the report, said the prominent feature am the accounts was a slightly diminished income and an increased dividend. This result was accomplished without in any wayimpairing the efficient workin of the railway, and dufin.n the half-year they had adoptei every means calculatedto 3norease the safety of the pbta'ne .Wotwithstandin the opOning in July last of the tstainos1Wki am,an Woking- Junction Rtailway, the competition for the Wokingham traffic, and also with the Great Western and South-Western Companies for the Reading traffic, there had been a satisfactory increase on the Reading and Reigate branch generally. The electric telegraph on their line had nzw become a source of profit instead of expense, the profit for the half-year having amounted toboautl,8001, They' had coiltinued to expend considerable sms out of zevenue in relaying and repairing the permanent way, and in renewing the rolUing stock. They would, have to continue the expense for some time in order to place the road in the best poSsible condition. The steam-packets were in excellent condition, and the reserve fund haaccumulated to the amount of 17,5001. for their renewaL When the short junction line between the main line and the Tunbrid e-
rells and Hastings branch wras completed they wouldhX able to save from a-quarter of an hour to 20 minutes on the Thersem oCf t8,6471. nhad benreaiUTUnzed f rom the sale of sur-
pluselands durin the half-yeear. They had been enabled to
reew their ntogeously, and to pay off all those
bearing 5 per eant. interest as they fell due. The fransfer department was found correct in every respect, and they had received every as6iatsneo from the officers of the company.
Mr. G. Trtomsox seconded the adoption of the report.
Mr. ADABis having made some observations on items in the accounts, and against extensions, concluded by moving an amendment to. the effect that the directors proceed with no extensions until the original shareholders receive a dividend of 5 per cent. per annum.-
Mr. BEAVIS seconded the amendment.
ar. C. BELL entered at considerable length into the ments of various railway projects in the South-Eastern district, which were now before Parliament.
Mr. RicHr, XP., a director, said it would be TerY injudlicious to discuss the subject at the meeting.
The amendment was negatived by a large majority, only one appearing in favour of it. The report was then unanimously adopted; a dividend of 15s. per s0l. share was declared for the half-year, less income-tax, payable on the 5th of Mlarch.
Mr. A. Beattie, Mr. S. Teulon, Mr. J. Melor, and Mr. Gilpmin, the retiring directors, were unanimously re-elected; and Mr. T. Brown, the retiring auditor, was also reelected.

The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.

TION.

The report statedtbat the line from Staines to Ascot had been opened for passenger traffic on the 4th of June, and from Aseot to Woldngham on the 9th of July last, the trains at the same time running on the South-Eastern line to Reading, to which town the goods traffic from London commenced on the 15th of September. The passenger traffic was fair, but would be better were it not for the opposition forced on the Great Western and South-Western by the South-Eastern Company. The goods traffic was expected to be remunerative. The directors, considering a junction with the narrow gauge of the Great Western line at Reading desirable, had applied to Parliai; eat for power to construot it.
The CesAIRAN, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the plans for the junction with the Great Western line had been approved by that comnpany.
Mr. Knmm, M, U.P., seconded the motion.

BURGLRS i THE WEST REDINDo-At Pbolut 2 o'clock on Thursiday morning a daring burglary was corn. ruitted at the house of Mir. Sarmuel Hall, of Slade Hooton, a few mniles from Duncaster. Four men effected an en. tranceintothebousebybreakdngthroughtbe kitchen window,. They proceeded at once to the bedroom of A1r. Hall, who was ro5hily awakened from his slumbers, and toldI by the tbieves that they wanited his money. He said he had nono, iupon which ono of the rufflans dealt him a blow on the head with a bludgeon, which laid open his skull and rendered him senseless. They then procee'led to ransack the house, and succeded in carrying away six 6.-notes, 271. im gold, six silver teaspoons, two silver tablespoons, a silver lever watcb a silver plated cup with lid, 21b. of tea, flb. of tobaco, ani a box cigars, with which they decanipod. -Mr, Hall is an elderly man, and would have lacd no chance of coping with the four thieves even if he had been aroused in time, while his house is situated too far from any other dwelling for any alarm he might have made to reach hig neighbours. On Sunday morning lastthe lock-nn atConuiborough, not far froin the scene of the above roobery was broken into. The keeper, an old man named Jaumes Hoson, hearing a noise got up, and on going down stairs received a severe blow on. the face from a bIrass candlestick, which one of the thieves had snatched up, and thus dsed to avoi'd detection. It was afterwards disoovered that two ffitcbei of bacon, two hams, one chap, and about 21. 10rs in m0ney had beon e away. The thves had obtained admissoit into the house by taking out a small window at one end of it. -

Sir J. PAXINGTON said it. was his AUll intention to move the second reading o£ his Bil on Wednesday unless the one previous order of the day occupied the whole of the aitting, which wasverynalikely.

The ATTORNEY-GENERA-L said with respect to the first part of the queston, as to the introduction in this session of a measure for lessening the costs of proceedings in bankruptey, he was not aware that the attention of the Government had been directed to the subject; and, with respect to the second part of the question, he had to observe that the matter was under the consideration of Government.
ARCTIC EXPEDITION MEDALS.
Admiral WALCOTT asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it was believed some objection seem ed to be made to granting clasps to those who were ts receive the Arctic expedition medals according to the number of times they had served in the Polar regions, hie would have any objection to having the numnber of tiaess tamped on the bar of the medal in liei of clasps?
Sir C. WOOD saidlthat the subj ect bad been considered, and the Government had come to the determination to issue one simple raedal to all who had been enigaged in the Arctic expeditions, without reference to the number of voyages or years of service. The officers who were enled in the late war, 40 years ago, received but one simple mal, and the profusion with which medals had been issued of late yiers tended to diminis their valuze.

ADJOURNEM OF THE HOUSE.
TE LAND TRANgSPORT CORPS.
Sir J. FERGUSSON rose to put s, question to the Under-Secretary of State for the War Department with zespect to the non-commissioned officers employed in the Land Transport Corps during the late war. Many of them, he maid, vere at present in a state of great uncertainty as to their future prospects, and were bordering on destitution, because, after having served their country moat zealously andablyin theCrimea, theyhad been diamssed from a service into which they were induced to enter by the flattering prospeocts held out to them by the Wa-roffice at the commencement of the war. The Land Transport Corps was formed for the purpose of aiding the overworked commissariat in furnishing the army in the Crimea with a regular supply of provislonsaudetherrequiaites. Thenon-commissionedofflcers employed in that corps had held commissions in other branches of Hecr MIajesty's forces previously to their joining it. They volunteered into it at a time when great difflcultv was eperienced in forming it. Itnowappearedthat
thelieutenants the he corps wereto beswept away, and that their places were to be filled up by men who had held inferior situations in the corps, and who had never been non-commissioned officers. Nearly th whole of the gentlemen on whose behalf he (Sir J. Fergusson) interested himself were not more than 35 years of age. It could not, therefore, be said that they had been dismissed from incapacity& brought on by old age. He wished to know what the war-office intended to do with themI Would they allow them half-pay, in accordance with the promise made in June, 1855? Were they to be allowed to sell their commissions ? The hon. and gallant member asked the Under SecretyforWar whether it wasintended to give theofficers of the Lend Transport Corps whose services were no longer required any half-pay or pension, and whether that half-pay won!dbe on the same scale as that given to officers of corresponding rank in other branches of the service; and, to put himseL in order, concluded by moving that the House should at its rising adjourn till Monday.
Sir W. CODRINGTON confirmed the remarks which had been made by the kon. and gallant member with regard to the good character and services of those non-commissioned officers who were taken indiscriminately from the Guards, the line, the artillery, and the cavalry, and made officers in a corps which. had been newly formed, and which was charged with the performance of very difficult duties. They had a great deal to do with horses, with harness, with carts,
and with waggons; and, as they ad the supervision of men placed in circumstances of gat difficulty, it was necessary that they should be men 0f extremely good conduct. He should be very sOrry to hear that these offlcers had beern placed in a worse social and military position than they de. served. (H1ear, hear.)
Sir D. L EVANS gave notice that he should upon the consideration of theArmyEstimates make some observations upon this subject.
Mr. F. PEEL had always understood that the 120 or 130 non-commissioned officers who upon the formation of the Land Transport Corps were taken from the line and the artiUery, and gazetted to that corps, were menwho had been selected on account of the excellence of their conduct and of their good services. When that corps returned to this country it was disbanded, and these non-commissioned officers had up to the present time remained upon full pay. Instead of the Land Transport Corps, a military train Xi been established much reduced in'numbers and strength, and in this force 20 or 25 of the oflicers of the Land Transport Corps had received commissions. The hon. and gallant member (Sir J. Fergusson)'must remember that these commissions were saleable and interchangeable with other commissions in the army, qualities which did not attach tocomminsions in the army, and it was therefore not surprising that officers had bceen offered commissions of somewvhat lower rank than those which they held in the Land Transport Corps. It remained for tho Government to disnose of those officers who hadnot receivedsuchcommissions. Many of them had not completed the term of service necessary to entitle them to pesions ibut it 'was admitted that it would be a hardship to require them to serve out their time in the ranks which they had held before their promotion. The other alternative, according to the regultions of the service, wvas to deal 'with them as officers. If the Government had taken this course and given them an allowance in the nature of half-pay it could have been only temporar, because they had not comnpleted a three yeas service. Under these circumstances the War-office had determined to deal with them in a special manner. Theyr bad made an application to the Treasury to authorize a scale of allowance to these officers varying with the rank which they held in the Land TransportCorps; and if that scale were sanctioned they would receive allowances at the rate mentioned by the hon. and gallant member.
THE MIURRAIN IN CATTLE.
Mr. STAFFORD said that the answer given to him by the right hon. gentleman the Vice-President of the Board of Trade last evening had filled him and other hon. members with dismay. The right hon. gentleman had said that the Board of Customs had displayed extraordinary sagacity by the destruction of one cdfl; but it was a subjectfor alirm that the remainder of the cargo, of which this calf was one, had been allowed to be landed; and it was probable that they might have besn infeeted by it. Would the right hon. gentleman state whether the Board of Customs or any other depatment of the Goveranent had made arrangements for preventing the entrance into this country of one of the most tremendous scourgea which could affect a thickly popliated land l'ke ours?
Mor. LOWE said that, in the absence of notice of the hon gentleman'sxintentionstoputothis question, he could only say that the Board of Trade had put themselves in communication with the Foreign-odce in order to obtain from our consuls al possible information on this subject, and had also eommunicated with the Board of Customs, from which they had received assurances that they were perfectly awakce to the danger which threatened the cattle 'of this country
s a proof of that, theo had stopped one animal and had had it killed on suspicion of its being affected with this
diseatste. dsaebigcmuicae.Tepritn
Lord NatS thought that the ansfw er of the right hon gentleman was most nsatisfactory. In 1741i this murrain was introduced into England by two calves from Holland, and the conse,uence was the destruction of 40,000 head of cattle in pottinghamshire and Leicestershire, and almost as many in Cheshire. The diseaAse raged wvith scarcely any intermaidionforueight yeard anddvisited nearly every partof the grazing districts of Eng7ad. The disease 'was of a moat conous character. It Mad been kown tovbe carried in the clothes of persons who attended upon the cattle, and there had never been a case in which contact had occurred without the disease beiag communicated. The permittine a cargo of cattle to land one of which was affected with ehis disorder must have resulted from the grossest 'gnorance o from want of instructions on the part of the officalcP si The practice of every State in Europe was at once to pro hibit the importation of cattle from countries where disease had broken out, and all 'who had studied the subjeet were of opinon that it was the duty of our Government to adopt the ame system. He sincerely hoped, therefore, that measures 'woud be taken wsthout delay to prevent he extension of this dreadfui scourge.
Mer. PACKE said this was a subject which concerned everyl consumer of meat in this county s well as the graziers and breeders of cattle, and the answers give on that evening and the evening before b, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade ere mo$s unsatisfactory. Since live caffle had been admitted duity free under Sir H. Peel's mcasures there had been a very considerable increase in the fatal diseases to which cattle were liable, and the agricultural interest had been extremely paien t under the losses to which it was thereby exposed. They knew tUhat a shpload of diseased cattle had been dispersed over the country, causing great danger of contagion.
wattle bought at fairs sometimes did not show symptoms o the complaint tillxtwo or three weeks after theyi la caught the ifection i and the mostruinous losses must ensne to the graziers if a check were not put immediately upon import.a tion. He)thereforehentreate none lord atfthe headtof the Government to take ehis urgent matter into serious conslderation.
Sir J. TYRELL said that attention had been called to this subject for many years by the a oval Aericultural Society; but in their report on the lungs comrplaint that body had come to the conclusion that, unfortunatel,nobo
knew anything about it. (A laugh.) A few years ago amallpox spread eatensively among sheep in this country,
disease having, no doubt, been the result of foreignimportation; but it afterwards suddenly disappeared in apparently the most miraculous manner. The right hon. gentleman (mr. Lowe) said he had destroyed on i call affected with the asas, so that his experience in the matter 'was plainly very limited. (A. laugh.)
Lord Pac IeERSTON promised that inquiry should be made hy the Government with a view oe the adoption Of whatever precautions were practicable to prevent the spread of disease among cattle.
CRIMEDAN MdEDAS.
Inl reply to a question from Colonel Gzarir
Mr. PEE3L said that the claims of the representatives of deceased soldiers w ere still being sen t in, and a number of medals was yet due. As regarded the Guards and the line, about 8,000 medals had been distributed, and 2,000 more remained in the office to be disposed of. All the claimus connected with the Guards would be settled in a few^ days. The whole of the claims made by the families of deceased officers and menn to the Artillery and
Engmeers had already been satisnee.d
The motion for adjourning the House at its rising till Monday next was then agreed to.
HOSTILITIES AGAINST CEINA.
ADJOURNED DEBATE.
The order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate having been read,
Mr. WARREN rose and said that, as one of the representatives of the people, he was anxious to express his sentiments on the momentous question on which the verdict of the House was fairly challenged, and in doing so he should endeavour to display that calm and dispassionate temper -which befitted the discussions of a great deliberative assmbly. The motion which had been read from the chair was now disembarrassed of that second branch to which the hon. member for Cardigan (Mr. L. Davies) hal referred; and, consequently, that hon. member and all who agreed with him were at liberty to vote on the general question embodied in the resolution. Ho (Mr. Wpren) solemnly assured the House that he utterly disclaimed b3ing to the slightest extent influenced by party consideration%. that mighty mouthpiece of pulblic opinion, Tai lYmes newspaper, this morning said that it happened in the progress of these debates in both Houses of 17arliameut that noble lords and hon. gentlemen eame to conclusions anda ex t opinions somehowr or other marvellously in accordance with their polticl incination,g. That was andhbefore he bad obtain(ed agsheaetin thathl e Ho ase, heulyer

That was one reason Zor his opposition to the motion; but he had also another, which he would itate' very briefly, and which the House wod! fprobably understand without munch expatiation. He Wus ceinly not a supporter of the present Government;

They had at least this negative merit, thit if they were powerless for good they were also werless for evil, and that in these days was no smallmerit (Hear ) Thera was DO man in that House whowould hail with peater joy thanhimself theadventtoofficeolfa pureConservativeGovernmnent, and he wouldgladlydoaUllinhispower tobringitabout; but so long as he had a seat in that Hlonse, he would never, by any vote of his, be accessory to bringing into rowermore particularly iucombination with a Conservative Government-ay of those right hon or hon. gentlemen who, for the last fewv years, had teen identified writh aUl the antiProtestant and democratic meurne2s which had been brought before Parliamnent (" Hear, hear," and langhter.)
Sir . Grs.w mi AdmralBxRKLYros together, but atr loud and continued cries for " GRA at idAdrzl s ssro&asogthr
The SPEAKER called upon
Admiral BERKELEY, who said, he would not trespass upon the attention of the House at any length, as he knewr they were desirous of hearing the right hon. member for Carliale. (Cheers) He wished, however, to discharge a duty towards an absent servant of the Crown whose conduct had been assiledin that House. The hon. and gallant member for Dartmouth (Sir T. Herbert) had made an attack upon the glant admmira in command in the Chinese seas which he ( dmiral Berkeley) didnot think was justifiable. In his opinion,thehon.and galantmnemberhadbeen cariedawayby feelings of partisanship, and had given an account of Admiral eymour's proceedings totally at variance with the facts. The galant member (Sir T. Herbert) said:-
" Surely the circumstanees of the case were no justification for our representative, upon his own authority, ordering the admiral not only to destroy forts, but to bombard for three days a commercil town containing a million and
half of inhabitants, involving an indiscriminate daughter of unoffeuding and unredsting citizens. It was said, too,
that such a bombardment was an act of signal forbearance.
rberance it was, with a vengeance. He could not imagine how a British admiral, without any declaration of war, or orders from the Adutiralty, could have been a party, and, as it appeared, awilling party, to such frightfal transac tions, and that he should think he was at liberty and warranted to destroy the lives and property of a city because it happened to be eoverned by a man whom he regarded as bemg guilty of the crime of pertinacity and discourtesy for declining his offered visit at his yamun in the city."
Now, although Sir IL Seymour bombarded the ports surrounding Canton, he did not fire a single shot into the city until he had sent his own captain on shore twice to warn the peaocable inhabitants' and "$civil people" who had offered a reward for the heads of Europeans. Sir M. Seymour took every possible means to acquaint the Inhabitants of Vanton with the course he intended to pursue, and his fire was purposly direted at the walls in order to avoid injuring the houses. Indeed, had Admiral Seymour bom. barded the town it would undoubtedly have been reduced to a ruin. The hon. and glant member bad stated that these proeoangs toolc place without the sanction of Her Majes sGovernment, butit was necessary that a commander-in-chief upon a foreign station should freqrently assume considerable responsibility without waiting for orders from England. If a contrary principlo were adopted the best plan wonld be to keep all coramanders-in.chiet intended for foreign stations in British harbours, and to send them out when it was too late to accomplish anything (A laugh.) He must say that Sir M. Seymour was as well fitted for command as ary man he had ever known. Sir ML Seymour was an officer of great discretion, judgment, and good temper, and-as Christianity had been mentioned-he would say that he was a traly Christian man. The hon. and gallant member for Dartmouth (Sir T. Herbert) had referred to the statement in a despatch of Sir IX. Seymour, that he had been unwilling to fight on a Sunday. He (Admiral Berkeley) thought it would be admitted that the Sabbath was not an appropriate day for the commencement of hostilities, but he gave Sir M. Seymour credit for having availed himself of the plea in order to give the obstinate Chineso an additional 21 hours for consideration (Hear, hear ) He would not trouble the House further, for his only object was to defend an absent brother officer. (Cheers.) He would conclude by quoting the opinion of Lord St. Vinoent- : When your ambassadors fail, call unon your admirals; their broadsides will be irresistible; but it Is the province of the British officer to go about the world doing no wrong." (Cheers.)
Sir J. GRArAMX-I should gLadly have rested the vote I am prepared to give on this question upon the speech of my hon. friend the member for thoWest Riding, who has moved the resolution, anda upon the speech of the noble inemboar for the city of London, and perhaps it would have been pradent on my part to observe sleneo had I not felt that I have a duty to perform to an absent friend, anda debt of austice to discharge to a public servant who has taken A prominent part in the transactions under consideration. by daty as a friend has been in some degree anticipated by the hon. and gallant member who has just addressed the House. I have long known Sir xL Seymour, and i fully corroborate all that has been said by the gallant admiral. I believe SiM .f Seymour to be one of the most brave, humane, and d1screet offlcers in Her Majgesty' service, and I am bound to say I do not think that a better selection for the Chinese command could posibly have been made. (Hear, hear.) I would add also in confirmxtion of what my right hon. and gallant friend (Admiral Berkeley) has said, that I do not think in the discharge of the duties of his command any man could be more certainly influenced by motives of humanity and Chrstian principle than Sir IL Seymour. (Hear.) I have said thus much of an esteemed and galUat friend, and all my presumption would be in favour of the course which, in difficult circumstances, that gallant officer thought fit to adopt. My right hon. and gallant friend has observed that when tho ambassador fails the admiral is caUed upon to act. In this case the ambassador, invested with the fuUl authority of the Crown (cheers), has, in my view, called upon the admiral, exercising hisoown discretion, and leaving none to that officer. (Cheers.) Far from regarding this as an abstract question, it appears to me to be one of the gravest and most complieated questions that can be raised in any deliberative assembly. It is difficult as a question of law; it is difficult as a question of policy. It raises the gravest considerations of humatity and religion. I am, however, oppressed with one considtration-namely, the great nicety of the question to what extent, on so distant a station, an admiral wielding all the immense power of England, should be subservient to the discretion of a civil servant of the Crown, whose judgment perhaps is byno means superior to that of theadmiral. Now, Immense interests are at stake upon this question, and, on the whole, I am decidedly of opinion that lt vwould be very inexpedient to define within narrow limits the duty of an admiral in the circumstances which have been described. My belief is that there must be no hesitation with reference to the quarter in which the supreme authority rests. I consider that an admiral must be regarded as a ministerial officer in cases of this kind, and that the supreme authority must be vested in the civil representative of Her Majesty. But if that civil representative be armed with such authority he inours the most weighty responsibility that can weU be conceived when he calls upon an admiral to make war; and if the responsibility of that civil ser. vant be great, how much treater is the responsibility o the executive Government here, which has to decide on the course taken ander such circumstances by a civil offloer nuaccastomed to commaund, and yet wielding his authority to the extent of involving this country in aU the re. sponsibility without, Iam afraid, much of the honour of war. I have said also that I have a debt of justice to perform to another public servant. It would be altogether unworthy of me to bear either hardly or unjustly on Sir John Bowring. We are able to form pretty just estimates of the character of those who have sat within these walls for some time, and many of us did Sit in Parliament with Sir John Bowrling. I shall freely express the opinion I have formed of him. I think him a man very apt to form strong opinions, in. variably pushing those opinions to the utmost extreme, and, on the wzhole, more remarkable for his self-confidence than for the soundness of Isis Judgment. (Great laughter.)

From the moment, however, that they do so uphold Sir John Bowring's acts they identify themselves with all that he has done-with his reasons, with hiis conduct,-snd I do not think, therefore, that with reference to this question it would be just to bear too hardly on the officer for whose acts they are rosponFAble.

I waited with some anxiety to hear some one of the law officers of the Crown (hear, hear) give us An exposition not only of international law, but of the law strictly bearing on this particular case, especially after the powerful arguiments that have been adduced on this subject on cliffereat rides of the House. (Hear, hear.) It would be presumptuous in me, unlearned in these matter, to expres too strong an opinion where doubts have been entertained by such grave authorities; but still this matter, after all, As a queston of law, appers to lie within a narrow com-

He sent it back to the colony to be rkported on with reference to the objenctions made by the Board of Trade, and the answer to thes objections you -wil find recorded at page 6 of the papers which relate to the colonial ordinane.

for tho Colonies, taking a highi prerogative view of the -subject, says that the Minister of his own authority may convey to the Govrnor of the colony the pleaure of the Crown without adopig the preliminary oeurse of obtmaem ing the consent of Her Majesty in Council; and it is fiuther to be remarkeds that in the present cae the important ceremony of proclamation did not take place, Therefore, Sir, wliether we regard the Inperial Act with reference to the ownership of a vessel, or whether we regard the colonia Act giving to the Chine a e iht a British gabem,theproisins f the Legislaturmerhave been set

Brintsh owners,and, whatver the disputed facts mrsy have been wh i regard to hau donngdon the liag, the owners of the vesseL were not entitled to hoist that flag. (Hear, hear.) The extradition artile, the ship not being a British ship, did not apply; an admitted p irate who had broken the laws of China was on board the vesel in the inner waters of Canton, within a satones throw of the Chines authorities; and if in such circumstances the Arrow was not a Britisht vessel, which I Cntend she was not, the Chinese had the most perfect right to board her and take the malefactor. (Cheers) But, Sir, this is a very small part of the eae. The House is fualer than it was when my noble friend the member for Huddersfield addressed you and put adpoint which it appears to me is of vital a or ac in this case. It was al put by the hon. and learned meinber for Ennisihden. The vestionnis no less than this-were not Sir J. Bowing and conasu Parkes perfectlyawareth atthe time of the seizure the lorcha Arrow was not entitled to British protection? (Cheers.) In asue for the moment that h am entirely wronig with regard to the British ownership. I assume that the colonial ordinance was valid, han that the license ranted under it was effective. But that license was only for a limited period. It had been grantea for only a year. That year had expired, and, notwithstanding what fell from the h6n. an& gallant admiral the member for Southwark, it is not even pretended by Sir 3. Bowrring, by Consul Parkes, or by their legal advisar in Hongkong that the license, having expired and not being renewed, was valid. (Hear, hear.) There is, indeed, a provision with respect to seagoing vessels that, after the lapse of a lear. until they return again to Hongkong, the license shall continue insforce. But it must be remembered that the troad between Htongkong and Canton must be regarded rather as a coastinthesn as an ocean trade. The distance from RongkOng to Cantont i eovered by a steamer in the Bourseofl2hours. Sixder had elapsed after the expirAtion of the license. No sep whatever had been taken to renew it, and thierefore the expirtion of the license must be considered asa fact admitted n the case. (Hear.) Now, by another regulation in the colonIal ordinance it is provided that the original ionens, when the vessel comes into port h where there is a British conxsul, must beepled In the bands of that officer. That took place in this case. Consu lParkes held the document, and had inspected it. In the papersit is stated that hewas aware of the flaw that the license had expired.

"It appears, on examination, that the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag ; the license to do so expired on the 27th of September, from which period shle has not been entitled to protection."

(Loud chees) Any argument coming from him after an assertion so rn-founded and so directly at variance with truth is not much to be regarded; but he says that the ignorance of the Chinese of this fact nul3ifies the justification whioh they might otherwise plead. I should not have thought much of that if it h*A been confined to Sir J. Bowning; but I see with regret that in a despatch from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs this very identical argument is used that the ignorance of the expiration of the license by the ehinweo destroys anyjustification they might advance.

Supposing that you admit this right of quasi naturalization-apposing ihat you grant that quas naturalization constituting owner-

In Her Majesty's gracious Speech at the commencement of tbe session the occurrences at Canton were thus spoken of:
"Her Majesty commands us to inform you that acts of violence, insults to the British flag, infraction of treaty rights committed by the local Chinese authorities at Canton, and a pertinacious refusal of redress have rendered it necessary for Her Majesty's offlicers in China to have recourse to measures of force to obtain satisfaction."
Now, the House and the country had before them in the ponderous blue-books the materials by which to arrive at a clear decision on tSe merits of the whole case. He would not go so far as the hon. member for the West Riding, and say that these documents were garbled, but wouldsasume that they were fairly put together for tho purpose of giving all the necessary information, and the innpression which they made upon him was that the whole iffair of the Arrow had been made a pretext for the pur se of carrying into effect long cherished designs. ear. I that were so, then the responsibility of Her Majesty's Government became very serious, for it could not be supposed that Sir J. Bowring would have Tetured to say, write, and do what he had unless he had been perfectly certain that he was acting with the full concurrence of the Government, and that what he had done would be approved at home. The legal part of this question, he contended, had been completely disposed of by the luminous and unanswerable speeches of two noble and learned lords in another place. Another noble and learned lord, who had spoken there in defence of the Government, indicated that he had very considerable misitvings on tho legal aspects of the ase, ad the Lord Cbief Jh mice, who was present at the debate, waa completely silent; from
which itmight be augured that he had nothng to offer: against the arguments of Lord Lvndhurst and Lord St. Leonard's. In 1840 we were on the eve of hostilities with Chuna, and a resolution condemning the conduct of the
hovernment was moved by the rght hon. baronet the member for Carlisle. In the debate ow that motion the late Sir Robert Peel used the following language:-
"t beg the liouse to remembertha', aIthough no mesage; has beea scat down to the House, it aPPearS frm the disdnct and intelligible declaranton of twso Ministers of the Crown that we are On the eve of hostilities with a eoantry which, in point of population, esceeds that of all the continental countries of Europe."
The cases were oxetly parallel, except that we were nowa actually at war, and both cases showed how just was the remark of the hon. and learned m ember for Sheffield, that th coantrol of Parliament over the exercise of the prerogas thve of declainug wur was a completo farce. we were now actually at war, and the question for the House of Commons to decidle, was whiether we had a just cause of quarrel. The Gosverument had the sistance of twe emnent lawyers in that House, one tlykled in equity and the other in common law, and he would chn enge them to show that we had either equitable or legad grounds of quarreL. The Attorney-General would not need to boe reminded of the maxim of his courts, *'He who wants equity must do equity.;" but w,here wzas the equity of our proceedings ? (Healr, hear.) The Solicitor-General was well acquamnted with eriminal law, aud knew that the question of guilt or innocence was one essentially and purely of intention. Adut ines facdi

The House Was ignorant of the secret Instructions upon which Sir J. Bowviag was acting, but they must presume he would not have ventured to pursue such a course if he had not relied upon a complete indemnity from the Government. They were sternly and severely scrutiizing tce conduct of the Crinesec as if they were a renfied European nation, but he would ask whether the Chnese had not re; - sanAto charge upon this enlightened Christian country the guilt of corrupting the morals, rining the health, and destroying the eternal happiness of the Celeatias empire? He wtihed to extract this great question fromd the meshes of mere commercial significance and importance in which some hon. gentlemen sought to involve it. Commerce oas undoubtedly of vast importaner, but Wash it to be placed in comparison with the maintenance of pubecmoralit and the preservaton ofvthaenationalcharacter? (Hear, hear.) He had no sympathies ith the peace-atall-price ncarty, for he thought the attitude of this country ought oobe that described in the line:-
" Lovers of peace, but not afraid of war."
If, however, they endeavoured by war to accomplish a sinister object he believed they would draw down upon their heads the retribution of the whole civilized world. In the language of Shalkspeare .
" Thrice is he arm'd that hath his euarred just
"hAnd he but naked, though locke up in steel,
" Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted."
The question was to which of these categories the must refer the transaction now under diacussion, and, in ms opinior, the papers upon the table failed to establish any satisfactory ustification for the violent measures resorted to at Canton. Hie was ready to support HIer Majesty's authority, so far as it Awas wielded by the Government, when ever it was exercised honestly and advantageouslyto the country, hute as in the present case he could not come to that conclusion, he felt his duty to vote for the resolation of thehon. member for the West siding.
The LORD-ADVOCATE would endeavour to state as brietoy and clearly as he could the grounds upon which he thought the motion ought not to receive the saction of the House. The sentiments so strongly expressed last night by hon. gentlemen who supported the resolution at asl events commended themselves to every generous mind, and he was not sarprised that they had produced considerable effect upon the House. Aithough he had hinmelf been carried awhy, to some extent, as the tide of eloquence rolled on, he felt that they had traivelled somewhat too rapidly over diffacult and daugerous ground. It was quite true that the topicsupon which they heard so much last night were most important in the consideration of a question of this nature. Peace with a great nation like Chinathe respect due to is antiqrity, its civilization, and its enormous population-the regard which ought to be enterined by a strong Pow towards one of eomparative weakness-the prevention of mischievous intermeddling whieh might plunge this ouantry into war without suffiient reasonthe faith of treaties-the maintenane of the greatGprin. ciples of incernational law and justice-all these were topics deserving careful consideration. There was, however, another snde to the picture. They must not omit to eo-r sider the question of individual justice to those who had been intrusted with great authority in a distant past of the world. (Hear.) They ought to be careful how they con. demned men who were not only absent, but who had. net the means or the opportunity of defending themselves, Great consideration, was due to a representative of this eountry who was obliged to act in serious emer gencies without the possibility of receivmig isutrue tions from the home Government. (Hear, hear.) Much independence of aetion was neeljssrily entrusted to plenipotentiaries, and so long as they were not proved to have done wrong it was the duty of the Government and the country to support them. (Hear, hear.) Aithough it was a most unfortunate circumstance that they should he involved Sn war with China, they ought not to neglect their duty to those who were intrulsted to their protection. He must warn hon. gentlemen that, in discussions of this nature, if they did not make sure that they were accurately dealing nth the faets, what was said and done in that House might oceasion lmXury to the national interests which it wvould be impossible to remedy. (Hear, hear.) He was ready to adopt the mai quoted by the noble member for thle city of London,-" Let us be just, and fear not" (cheers); but he did not speak simply of justice to individuals, for it was the lot of puble sefrvants in this country that they must sometimles submit to injustice; but injustice to individuals in such circumstances was, nevertheless, a national calamity, It often happened that individuals suffered severely from discussions in that House in consequence of imperfect information, and that tbroug;h them the public service suffered also. (Hear, hear.) On this point, however, he would make no further obecervatious, but woul proceed to call the attention of the House

questions before the House-one was whether the proceed-
ings of Sir John Bowring and his coadjutors -were accord ing to international law; the other was whether, supposing they were lemaly right, the poliy they pursued was such as ought to have ben folowed in the cirouistances in which they stood. With respet to the questioh of law, ho entered on it with a great deal of diffidence. Great authorities had pronounced against the view which he humbly took. Great names had been quoted in that House aainst it, and it was with saslthe hmiiety that a man ought to feel in such circumstances that he ventured to state his opinion - but at the same time he thought it right to say that,gdving ali due weight to those great legal authorities, the opinion he bad formne was one which he heldwithout much hesitation. (Hear.) He thought it could be demonstrated from the proceedings before them that there was no true ground for saying that any principle of international law had been transressed by the authorities at Hongkoug. (Hear, hear)i He was anxious to get the House out of the region of generalities which surrounded the subjct, because he be-
lieved it would be found that the only safe way in which.. the legal qLueztion couldi be sifted -was to deal with it in connexion with the facts as they had takent place in China - for a good many of the general propositions which had Lean laid down might be more or less true, while they bad no aptlication to the facts Out of which the whole quetion h rie.(Hear, hear.) The facts ware shortly these:--
After the treaty of 1842, anad down to 1855, a large XOpu,la. tion had grown up in the colony of Hlonglkong, an ~when these proceedings commenced there were about 60,000 Chinese in the colony. He did not say they had ceased tobesubjcts f Cina,or hd lot teir alegiance (hear, hea), ut heywee lvin uner urlaws and under our colonial Governor, Sir John BowrngU alowe thedse Chins

Was that ordinance a dead letter? Was it a thing done in a corner? Or was it unknown to the Chinese? I au e no tffct,lorchswere registered by hundreds, and it =ean notorious thUa the eoastin3g trade of China was ah lorohs saing under the British flag. (Hear.) In September, 18M5, the Chinese seized four lorchasbearngthe Britishl flag; Sir 3. Bowilng remonstrated,andpointedouotto themthat by the treaty they were notentitled to seize those;vessels. On that occasion the Chinese made no complaint about the treaty; they never pretended they were ignorant of it, for, indeed, a copy of it was sent to them, and without the least remonstrance the lorchas were restored. (Hear,'hear.) It was a principle of international law that if a nation was in possession of and exercised an alleged right which had not been disputed; whatever the merits or grounds of that right might be, the nation was entitled to eontinue in possession of iLt without interruption till a remonstranoe was made against it. That was an elementary principle of international law laid down by Grotius and all the great authorities. In such a case no country was justified in taking the law into its own hands. They were bound in the fist instance to remnonstr-te, and fremonstrce fAiled, then they might act. To take ali example :-thmere was an island near Bushire that formerly belonged to the French. We had lately landed troops there, and s;pposing they were to remain for twvo years that ratght give ui s no right to It, but still the French woid not be entitled, without first remonstrating, to take steps for the recovery of the island, or to land abody of troops for that purpose. A nation in such a caseawss entitled to maintain its position till step had been taken to show that itw_swron. How could the affairs of nations be carried oa on ans other prin ciple than that? (Hear, hear.) Of course, if theelement od bWd faith-were once admitted the argwnest did aot apply, for aginst a fraud there always existed a right to a remedy, but if the nation acted in good faith, then no violence could be proleeded with in the first instance to interrupt its possession. If, therefore, he did not care to stop and inquire to what extent we might or might not ove had power to license these lorchas, the cause must be obvious. These loIchas were Hiensed for the benefit of the Chinese themselves (ironical cheers); and a proof of this was that the licenses were very extensively used.(Hear, hear.) They were employed in
order to enable us more effectually to put down smuggling or the eoas, and that we might be able to distinguish between these who were license traders and those who were muggler. Bnt, whether that were so or not, it was plain that the Chinese never Imagined the ordinance was agaist them, for they allowed the system to go on for two yeas and a-half without remonstrance. (Hear, hear.) But what were the objections that had been stated? And here he must say that matters had been confounded which were entirely and essentiall differet. One objection was that no country was entitled to grant such license to the ship of another nation; and another was that the ordinance of 1855 went entirely in the face of our own municipal law. Now, the second of these objections ap-eared to bim to have nothing to do with the question. The Chinese had nothing whatever to do with our municipal law. If the ordinance was iustiEed by the lav of nations,, it was clear that they could have no right to say they objected to it because they had a repugnance to our Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 (Hear, hear.) Was there to be no force inthe orders of our colonial Governments so far as regarded foreign mnations, unless the latter were first satisfied upon every guestion of law that mlght arise upon

foreign vessels as against their own counr
Thatwastantamount to saringthat it w cu impo rbleto register a vessel owned by a ?ore-gner. (Hear, hear.) Now, it was of course lawful for a nation to register a ship in any form it p leased- but it was said that, grantig theps. session of a register, the vessel could not be calle[ a Brtish vessel, because the owner owed allegiance to another country. Was that correct, even as regarded our own practice? TIn the exsting Merchant Shipping Act it was enacted that not only natutrAl born subjects of this country might be the owners of registered vessels, but per. sons born in other countries rmight d, provided they had letters of naturalization, and took the oath of allegiance. (Cheers from the Opposition.) But did the taking of the oath of alle4[ance to the British Sovereign prevent them from remaining under allegiance to their native countries? If the Chinese of Hongkong took the oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria, did they cease to be Chinese subjects? Hon. gentlemen opposite declared exatly the reverse, and he said the same. (Hear, hear.) The question of letters of naturalization was raised the other day, when it appeared that, although a man might be naturalized here, that did not release him from bis allegiance to the country in which he was born. Bat if we registered a ship under our Merchant Shipping Act, and aBritish merchant chartered it and took a British crew, would we allow our Oa to be pulled down by any nation in the world under thepretence that the original owner was a foreigner ? (Hear, hear.) When we once registered a vessel and use it as a British vessel, would we not protect it against all the world? Suppose that when we were engaged in hostilities with Russia a neutral Power had fired upon our flag, under the Pretext that the owaer of the vessel was originally a native of that country, would we have put up with that Insult or permitted it to go unredressed ? Certainly not. The true principle was, that it lay with Britain to say what aBritish ship should be-thatit belonged to each country to say to what kind of vessel its authority should be given. If any other country thought it had a right to complain it had the power of remonstrance, but, in the first instance, it lay with Britain to say what should and what should not be entitled to the protection of her flag. (Hear, hear.) The enforcement of that principle was a boon, not an injury to the Chinese themselves. (Ironical cheers from the Opposition.) He. repeated that the fact of these lorchas carrying a British flar, so far from being against the interests of the Chinese, was, on the contrary, aprotection to the Chinesesnmdto ourselves against the pirates and smugglers who infested those seas. (Hear bear.) Such was the view he was inclined to take of the international question, and it appeared to him that the first ground was conclusive-viz., that when we were found in the undisputed exercise of a right for a series of years the Chinese were not entitled to take the law into their own hands. (Hear, hear.) That being the state of matters, the Arrow, with the British flg flying, came into the waters of Canton, was boarded bya party of Chinese offiicilsevidently not by accident or chance, but in a manner wrhich show redthat their proceedings had been preconcerted-and the crew 'mare carried off, The first question was-was that justifia'jle by the law of nations, on the pretence that our Government had no power to pass the ordinance ? Looking at the position in which matters stood, and the use which had been made of the ordinance without remonstrance or question, he said that the Chinese were bound in the first instance to make a representation to the British authorities if their ground of action was that they disputed the legality of the register or our power of passing the ordinance. But the real question lay here-was that proceeding on the Dit of the Chinese in good faith or not? (Hear, hear.) It would be difficult for the House to settle that question from the papers- but while on the one hand the conduct of the Chinese might be immaterial if proceeding from accident or mistake, it became on the other most important if proved the result of intention and dedgn. If the British flag was flying they knew the fact, and they also knew that the vessel was sail
ing nder British authority. Under these circms tances their course was simple. Consul Parkes was living on the spot, and, instead of sending two mandarins to carry off the crew at once, it was their duty to apply to him, in order to ascertain whether the vessel was really under British protection. Why did they not do that ? Was it that no remonstrance had been made before? Not in the least. There had been a remonstrance in the previous September on the same subject, and that remonstrance had been successfaL Was it that they were ignorant of what the vessel was? He rather thought not. He thought there were plain indications in the correspondence that they knew the history of the vessel. He had no doubtthattheirproceedingswerenomistakeatalL Theyknwe perfectlrywelthe cireumstancesinWhichthevesselwas$ their proceedings were designed, and were taken for tne purp
of showing that they did not intend to recognize the Brntish flag under such circumstances. If they were not bound to recogmze the British flag they were at least bound to say so. Talk of civilized nations I Any civilized nation, if it disputed a right which we had been exercising for a long time, would in the first instance remonstrate witE our representatives. NTo civilized nation wvould issue proclamations offering a reward for the heads of its adversaries. (Hear, hear.) China was not entitled to be put in the category of nations wvith which it was possible to deal according to strict international law. (Hear, hear.) He now came to
a part of the case which h&ethought had caled forth remarks a great deal too strong-he meant the letter in which Sir J. Bowring referred to the fact of the expiry of the register. He should assume for the present that the view he had stated of international law was correct. But it turned out that the register of the Arrow, having been granted in October 1855, had expired about a week before the seizure by the Chinese officers. Sir J. Bowring wrote a letter in which he stated that,-
tl The question presents two important inquiries-first, thc rights of the vessel in question, and, second, the conduct of the Chinese authorities. It appears, on examination, that the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag; the license to do so expired on the 27th of September, from which period she has not been entitled to protection. YouL will send back the register to be delivered to the Colonial-office. But the Chinese had no knowledge of the e:roiry of the licenss, nor do they profess that they had any other ground for interference than the supposition that the owner is nota B ish subject. That, however, is a question for this Governnen4, who granted the register, and it is clear that the Chinese authorities have violated the 9th article of the supplementary treaty, which requires that all Chinese malfausanta in British ship shall be claimed through the Brtish The hon member for the West Ridin had used very stron language in regard to this letter, callng it " the most flagi tious public document" that he Oversaw. (Cheers from tie CYppoition.) Ho did not know that he was wise in tryng to stem the torrent of indinatlon which the remarks pf the hon. mnember had excited against the letter. Perhaps, beinga layer, he might be acused of sharp practioe; but, avisg read the letter carefully having formed an mpression regarding it entirely 4ifferent from that ef the hon. member for the West Riding, and believing that what it meant to say did not savour of duplicity, or secrecy, or false eaeling, hlt asmounted to the simple asser-

(A laugh.) sieghout Us whole transaction the most mscrosoois erchmntion of evidence could not discover an atom of evidence to show that the Arrow was a Britis C ship. (Hear, hear.) There was something curious about the $1,000 paid by Mr. Blockc or'his cotApiradorc at Canton. The Chinese Commissioner discovexed that a Danish merchant d paid the $1,000, and h e ame to the conolusion that it was paid on account of the register. The English officials at Canton bad very ittle chance with the Chinese Commisioner, for he always reverted to the true point in the cuse, and that was that the lorcha was a Chinese ship. "lrove to me," said the ohinese Commissioner, in effect, "that this is a British ship " but Sir J. BowLing, from his inability to answer the Commissioner never did , o spond to that chal leCge. What he (,r. Wfhitesde) remarked in the correspondence was that the Chines Commissioner niever
spke an untruth; hae was sorly to have to makce that distinction. (A laugh.) The Chines Commissioner always put the point of the Dha ish merchaotfadvancing i,000 as part of the pu:chase-oney
and alwas contenid that thepoip was a C thiehip. He tight retinia the Hoass that istune, 1855, just on the time when the lorcha bad arrived at Hoingkog, the authorities at home were considering whether the ordinance framed by Sir John Ba-wring should exist at altas a colonial law, or iS any shape wbatever; and he f Mr. Whiteside) was gratified by reading the proceedings which took plac in this country on that subject. The noble lord the member for the city of London and his predecessors acted on that occasion in a manner which nobody coull blame. When Sir J. Bowring sent that ordinance to Landou, the noble lord the 3membe-r for the city of London, who was then Secretary for the Colonies, forwarded it to the Board of Trade, and the anwer of that department to the noble lord ws, that it was contraytolaw. Mr.eBooth writing ontbehalfnofithe Board of Trade, said :-
"There is nothing in the Act providing that the Chinese residents to whom colonia regiters may be grnted should be British subjects nor are any local limits a ged within which the register is to boe in force; and if it beitended that the grant of a colonial register shall confer on the vessel the rights and hrivileges attaebing to a British vessel, it appears to my Lords extremely questionable whether this departure from the Mtrchant Shipping Act (17th and 18th of Vctoria, c. 104), according to which British ownership
"I an es ential condition, and, in fact, the only condition, of British registry, should be sanctioned by Her Majesty." That was a pretty strong hint that it was faulty and cor-
to law. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord the member ftr Lag Qn did not give Sir J. Bo th ority o goits
war, hut he sent a letter to him in theseg terms oni the very day onL which the lorcha was arriving in Hongkong :
lHaving referred the ordinance passed by the Logislature of Hongkoxg 'to establish a proper system of registration for colonial vesseils for the consideration of the Aords of the Committee of the Privy Coumci for Trade, I trans. rait for your information the copy of their Lordships'reply; and I have to requet that you wil transmit to me any observations which youe have to offer on the objections entertained by their Lordships to some of the provisions of this ordinance."
The ordinance having gone out to Sir J. Bowring, he, as usual wrote an essay on the matter. (A laugh.) That was dated on the 29th of August, 18e, and the ordinance was returned with it to this counltey. On the c0th of November in the sane -year thee was a very reluctant assent given on the part of the Board of Trade to that meet dangerons proceeding. Mr. Booth, communicating that assent, used these words :
"NI am at the sani time to suggest, for the consideration of Mt. Secretary Labeuchere, whether, as some doubts mnay be entertained as to the lawfulness of the use of the British flag In vesels registered in the name of Chinese residents as provided by the ordinance, it might not be desir. able that an ordinance should bo passed, under the authority of sectien 547 of the Imperial Act, declaring that, notwitbstanding anything in the oInprial Act, the v*esels in question, if pesseing a colonial registoer, and while beng navigated within the proposed limit, should be entitled to use the British flag.
That advice having been given, the ordinance went out to China. He need hardly remind the House that king had lest their crowns for tWmpering with the dispensing power of this country. (Hear, bear.) Jle would ask, had the Chief Secretary of State the right of exercising that disps fing power? He contended that theke was ilegality in every stop of this proceeding from first to last. (Bear, bear.) There sever was in this case a legal ordinance confirmted by
aer Majesty, there never was a proclamation in the colony of such a law, and consequently what had been done by Sir John Bowring was utterly and absolutely void. (Chjsrs.-) Now, one of the conditions on which a colonialregher was to be granted, as set out in the ordinance, was ta t was to las. for one year anln o longer. It was true tha at the expiration of the year it might be renewed,
if the party holding it took no step to procure its renewal it ceased to have any further operation.
averting to the conduct of Consu Parkes, it appeared to him (nr. Whiteside) to be very much worm than that of
Sir Jehu Botwurring iha one res re LodArcae ih ar John abowing id one reenabect. What was to be thought of Mr. Parke's saying, in a letter to Sir J. Bowrhig,e vuer the date of October 12, 1856, a
" I also forward, as directed by youar Exceolenoy, the register of the Arrow. When this document was deposited with ine on the 3d inst., the yearmfor for which it was granted had expired five days previously."
He confessed he was thuinderstruck to hear anu English gentleman make suchPamstatement s n that under the eircusitances. Mr. Consul Park(es first of al stated that the ship was enwtitled -to use the British flag and then, in the same breath, he ad imitted asoe had no' right to use it. (Hear, lhear.) Then came the consul, who also id the register had expired five days before ; but it brought the blush of shame on the cheeks of bonourable maen to find that both those persons asserted the direct contrary, in order to bulls- a weak nation (hear, hear), asid that, when the matter come before ParliamenLt the Goverunient who advocated their cause defended their conduct by an excuse a thousand times worse than the original crimne-thiey told a lie, but the Chinese didanot kniow it. (Hear, hear.) Anything mnore flagitious in refErence to a question of mnorality never came before a body of independent, conscientious men (hear, bear), and it was not surprising that the learned Lord Advocate, with all his ability, had not been able to make out a better case. It was impossible to do so, and he (Mr. Whiteside) was rejoiced to fiudthat,however much hon. gentlemen in the House differed in political views, yet, wbhdn a matter of this kind came before it, members on both sides were eager to respond tothe inspiring appeal of the noblelorathe mnemberforthe city of London, and that they agreed with him there was something nlioer than comnierce -somethiugimore than budlgets, to be considered by the Parliamaent of England-there were the eternal interests of trixth and justice. (Hear, hear.) He had bi-t few more reuiarks to miake respecting tlle consul - but there -was one passige to which he wvished to call the'
attntin o th Ho,e.Mr.ConulParkes drew up~ an elaerae ppe, wichhe aled noifcation to the Chinese to emoe mscncetios,in hichesaid,-
"At Hng bing Briish olon, it is competent
haveu obtaiiox any Mese Of any 'country, vwhen he shall have obtailed the requisite security, to make application,
through the proper oficial channels, to the supreme authority for a colonial register. TJnder this the vessel hoists a
British ensign, aid, tVe register once issued, she is regardedI in all respects as a British vessel, while those on ooard her become alike responsible to Britsh control and entitled to British protection."
He (Mr. Whiteside) wanted to know from the learned Lord Advocate, who bore a high legal reputation, whether that statement was true in law, that subjects of anv country in the world going to the colony of Hongkong, and obtaininS a colonial register for a vessel having once hoisted the British flag, that vessel became te all intents and purposes a British ship, which we were boun4 to protect all over the world against all other Powers. He (Mr. W.hiteside) donied that to be good law, but in that matter he could not attribute worse than Ignorance to the young man fresh from a counting-house who was now invested with sunh inmnortant fInctions. It was not only a misstatement of law; but it was a msstatement of fact. There was no mention of the requisites to be complied with beforo a colonial register was granted, and the charge against Mr. Parkes was that he drew up that statement in order to deceive the Chinese, and toobtain by compulsion what never could bave been obtained by the construction of any law. The learned Lord Advocate had told them a great deal depended upon tha avistijusof the Chinese. Be it so; but why were they alvays to.L&sune points in their own favour? Pist, there VA' the insijt to the British flag; that was an asaundptton, Nexti, there was a British ship; that was another assumption.

It was said the British ,flag as flying at the time. He hoped the right hon. the Vice-President of the Board of Trade (Sir. Lowe) had recovered his official composure after his outburst of olficial e'oquence the preovibus evening, when he appeared to be almost prepared to wrap himself up in the flag of England, and to die gloriously for tho honour of E gland which would be too fearful a sacrifice. (A laugh. E'e (Mr. Whiteside) felt a high respect for the flag of ngland. It vwas, mo doubt, the emblem of the power of our country; it might be the guardian of our freedom, and he boed it would floattriumphanton every sea and in ever clime, provided that the extension of the power of England should be accompanied by her laws, her libezty, and, above *11, her justice. (Loud cheer) But the flag of England would be dishonoure4 and disgraced whenever it was used to screen crnme, to terrify the weak, or to bully the defenceless. (Hear, hear.) In such case the flag of England ceased to be a worthy emblem of a great, a free, and a powerful nation. (Hear, hear.) The learned lord had varned the House to take care of small beginnings, which might lead to great consequences. So he (Mr. Whitesidel also said. Lot them bewaze how they suffered any stall infraction of international law-how they perraitted a Government to trench upon the rights of an independent State. let them beware of permitting an Government to trample upon the 'weak or to submit to the strong. (Hear, hear.) The learned lord had aid tbat the lFench at Canton assented to the proceedings of the British officials
but was the French officer there aware tha t there had becn equivocation, falsehood, evasion, mfisre resentation ? Was the French officer aware that the vessel rwas not entitled to the protection of the British flag? Was he aware that Dr. Eowring had 'written and Mr. Parkes had admitted that the regiRter bad expired-that it had been from the beginning bad? Was he aware that the original cause of quarrel had been more than atoned for, and that then the ground was changed? (Hear, hear.) What punishment would any one believe would satisfy an official who dared to make war upon an independent State without the authority of his Sovereign or the sanction of Parlianient ? The original-cause of quarrel 'was at an end, sufficient blood had been shed, and enough property destroyed; but then what did MIr. Parkes say in answer to a deputation from the people of Canton, who made an earnest appeal to him to spare the city and their families-to have mercy upon them, but they got none? Wbat was the answer? It was that-
" If simplereparation for outrage in the 'Arrow' case ad been all we required, the admiral would doubtle3s have been long ago satisfed with what had been done (hear, hear), but that a principle was at stake which could not be abandoned. Evidence of necessity for access to the authoritieswebadlonghad; the 'Axrow'case confirmed it, and less than intercourse as we asked it we could not take,"
Thus it was that new ground was taken up when tbe case of the Arrow was disposed of and after a more than sufficient vengeance had becn taken for any offenoe which could have been given. He asserted that the conduct and behaviour of the British authorities had been not merely supercilious-it was arro. gant, overbearing, insolent, and domineering. The mildest thing they would say was, " The whole town of Canton lies at our mercy." Who were they 'who dared to use that lan. 8nisge ? (Cheers.) Who authorized them to use that language ? BIear.) Were the offlcials in the colony to be at lberty to pursue such a course, and then were Ministers to use the argument of the Lord-Advocate, that we must supn port our officials abroad? Would they stand by injustice spoliation, and plunder? (Hear.) How could they, who belonged to a relgious community, and who called upon the House of Commons not to allow the Sabbath to be dese. crated by Sunday bands, answer the appeal of the Chinese Commissioner, " I understand that your honourable nation has hitherto reverenced the Sabbath-day ?" The Chinese Commissioner was more Christian than the men who had desecrated it. He said solemnly and sincerely that this bloody assault, in which it was imTposible to tell the number of lives taken away, this destruction of property, this sudden and terrible infliction upon a populous and civilized city, filed him with amazement, and he asked whether in addition to the other vicesdisplayedin these proceedings the vice of hypocrisy was to be displayed by those who defended themI HEar. He threw aside these bluebooks. (Cheers.)IlThe House ad had enough of these bluebooks. (Hear.) They heard very often of Christianity. It was the foun(dation of our humble hopes. It came to us
'ith healing on its wings. It told us of some truths to be believed and many duties to be practised. Among the foremost of those duties was our duty to our neighbour. But who was our neighbour? He 'who spoke as never man spoke left us a lesson on this subject from which we should never depart in our dealings with other nations. Hon. gentlemen had spoken of the feelings of Christian merchants. He complmented the hon. member for the West Riding, who said that he owed all he had to mercantile enterprise and liberality. But there was something supe. rior to the love of money, to commerce, and the passion for gain. It was true that the British merchant in his count. mg-house was as benevolent, as active in good works, and as abhorrent from cruelty as any man that breathed the breath of life. Butthis was a matter in which the authority of the Crown and the power of Parliament had beensetatnaught. The wbole proceeding, from beginning to end, was unjusti. liable. It had now come for decision before the House of Comumons-to that tribunal whose power the most potent Kings respecced. Anid he trustedthat theselittledespots 'ho wren sent out to govern distant dependencies would he taught to understand that a real practical authority re. sided in that House whenever the great maxims of justice were concerned, and that the House would resent any infraction of them as an injustice offered to themselves. (Hear, hear.) He had heard men who had been in battle describe the events of the struggle and its consequences. They described the agonies of the wounded and the cries of the sufferers as lost in the shouts of victory and in the blast of the trumpets. When thevictory was won and the battle was overthey remembered the great' object for which they contended-that the war had been engaged in with due notice and warning; that it was un. dertaken to repel the march of a tyrant, perhaps to assert the independence of a nation, or to maintain the liberty of the world. But 'what was this but an attack upon de. fenceless women and children and the destruction of their habitations? And all this havoc was created upon a miserable, contemptible, baseless quibble. (Hear, hear.) That was the case oresented for the decision of the House of Commns. They had listened to the best defence the Government could make. He had no doubt of the result, for his conviction was that the House of Commons would do justice no matter what the result might be.
(Cheers.)
Mr. lHORSFALL thanked the noble lord the member for the city of London for the courteous manner in which he
had spoken of the niercantileinterests of this country, 'which
was in striking contrast with the manner in which the same topic had been treated by the hon. raember for the West Riding, and backed by hIds hon. and leare
friend (IL Whiteside). It apeaed to hima that the,wol
q onrelved itslinto fwagthe A arow a British veslo no? (Hlear.) Did the Chinese believe her to be a British vessel at the time they committed the out. rage? Now, there was evidence enough of the name. There 'was no question that they believed her to be a British vessel, for they knew that the " Arrow" was not a Chinese name, that she was not painted like a Chinese, and they saw and hauled down the British flag. He thought that the insult was complete, and that it was intended. The opinion of Baron Wensleydale had been referred to, but as it had been misconceived by an hon. member he would read it to the l.ause. The noble and leaned lord said:-
Sir John Bowring had mistaken his case in slpl,
that the license had expired; for it was clear it hab not, as on the evidence it appeared that the captain of the lorcha at the moment of the seizure was intending to return to Hongkong and renew his license, having previously depo. sited his leense in the Hongkong registry. He therefore cencluded that the seizure was clearly wrong, entitling the British authorities to demand redress, and, considering the case precisely as it -stood on the 8th of October, without any regard to subsequert events, he was not satisfied that the British officers had acted unwisely or imprudently in resort. ilg to immediate force."
Such was the noble and learned lord's opinion and he for one was content to rest on it as far as the law oi the case was concerned. The next point to which the noble lord the member for London alluded was the demand of an entrauce into the city of Canton. There was no doubt that Sir J. Bowring bed a perfect right by treaty to insist on that entrance. The House had been told that Sir G. Bonhain relinquished that right; but, in reality, it was only kept in abeyance until a proper opportunity should arrive for en. forcing it. WVhether the opportunity chosen was a proper opportuaity it was not for him to say. (H ear, hear.) Xe was not standing there as the advocate of Sir J. Bowrin
That functionary was the friend of the hon. member for the West Riding. The third point to which the noble member for London alluded was the plicy which thn Government intended l b ut, in tEe absence of any statement as
to tbeir intei(ted policy, he could n-o-t v-entro-' 'to `off-er&y opinion on that point. He would now proceed to notice some observations which fel from the hon. member for the West Riding, and which, indeed, being personal to thoso he bad the honour to represent, was the chief cause of his addressing the Houoe, for he should be quite unworthy of the honour conferred on him by his constituents if he allowed that language to pass unnoticed. The hon. momber for the West iding, alluding to
theEast India ancd China Association of Liverpool, said, "These gentlemen are telling our Foreiga Minister what they wish him to do in China," and the hon. member quoted the following paragraph from their memorial:
"The British Government should insist on the ri,ghtof opening to foreign trade any port on the coast of China or on the banks of any navigable river at any time they may
think fit, and of placing consuls at such portsf; that oucr shp fwar should have the free navigationx of and access to al the ports and rivers of China."
Thje hon. memAber saidi such language was to he reprobated.
(Hear, hear. Hon. gentlemen should hear both sides of
tecase be ore they cheered. " Contrast," said the hon. mebr the kindly and conciliatory laniguage used by GeeallAguilar and Admairal Cochkane with the downright selfish violence and unreasoning injus tice with which the Liv elsscation, would treat an eempire contaimng ,000,000 people." The hon. meomber implied that the Liverpool Association in-
tendedto urge Lord0Clarendon toforcea way intoall the ports and rivers of China; hut it should be borne in mind that the memnorial was written on the assumption that England was at war with Chin and conseguently that
another treaty would be necessar. They °therefore, very properly suggested that Lord Clarendon 'should0in that treaty endeavour to obtain access to thprts and ivers ien Ch cina. tStuch a measue,eonended,wvouldbe not only the 'whole empire of China. (Hear, bear) )Thisry washis

That' izht hbethe OpL` ion, of the hon. member, who hd told the Hobse that he had visited many parts of the world, but hiad nevei yet mentioned thati he had been to China. On the other hiad, the gentlemen who ha signed the memorial on which' the hon. member cornraented had been resident in Chi"a ind engsgd in oonmerceewith that country for manv year. They knew the feelings and the requirements of the Chinese peol, yet the hon. member modestly told the House that
e new more about the Chinese. (stear) He would not dwell longer on the modesty of the hon. member or on his complimentr languageto the merchants of Liverpool, but he would remind hon. entlemen, partIcularly those on the Opposition aideof theoousewhoproRosedtofollowthoe hon. member for the West Riding as their le:der on this occciglon, that this was not the first time that the hon. member had boasted of Inowing more and being able to do more than other people. Th&e*on. member said he could crumple up Russia like a piece of paper; but the hon. member must by this time have round it to be a very stiff piece of paper. (Cries of "Hear, hear.") The hon. member for the West Riding had spoken a great deal of the civilization of the Chinese, nd contrasted it with that of the Liverpoolmerchants and of those who took part in the hostilities against the Chinese. Now, bad as those gentlemen might be, he (Mr. Horsfall) did not think thet they would have issued that proclamation which had been very frequently alluded to, hut not resad that evening. He would just read that specimen of Chinese civiliUation for the benefit. of the hon. ember for the West Riding. Governor Yeh's proclamation was in the following words :
"The English barbarians have attacked the provine5al city, and wounded and injured our soldiers and psople.
Their crimes are indeed of the moetheinous nature. Where fore I herewith distinctly command yot to join together to exterminato them, and I publicly proclaim to all the milltar and people, householders and others that you should unite with all the means at your command to assist the soldiers and militia in exterminating these troublous Eng. lsh villainis, killing them wheneveryou meet them, whether on shore or in their ships. Foreach of theirlives thatyou may thus take you shall receive, as before, $30. All ou
to respect and obey, and neither oppose nor disregard this special proclamation."
A speedy consequence of that proclamation was that an English vessel was boarded by the civilized friends of the hon. member, 11 persons were murdered, and no doubt the Chinese received for those murders 30 dollars a-head. He wished the hon. member joy of his civilized frieads. (Hear hear. He (Mr. Horafall) was not now engaged im trade th Chia, but he happened to hAve a vessel lying off Canton at the time of the great fire. With the characteristic humanity of Englishmen, the captain and all his crew, with the exception ofsuch of them as were required to take care of the vessel, volunteered to do all they could to extlnguish the fire. They were thankfully admitted into the city, and they assisted to their utmost in extinguishing the fames. But no sooner had they succeeded in putting anend to the fire than the civilzed friends of the hon. member turned their bayonets against them and drove them out of the city. He felt it to be his duty to vote against the motion. He admitted that he differed from the hon. member upon many pointe, but he should certainly not on that account vote against him if he thought that the hon. member's motion was founded on justice. But he believed that the House would be guilty of an act of great injustice If It agreed to e motion. An assent to it would in effect amount to a direct censure upon the hon. member's absent friend-Sir J.lBowring-and upon an absentadnmiral ("No I no !"), who was one of the most humane and gallant of Englishmen. (Hear, hear.) It would amount to a vote of censure on that noble lord who had so long, so well, and so succesfually conducted the foreign affairs of this country, (hear, hear), and upon Her Majesty's Government. He (Mr. Horafall) differed from Her Majesty's Government upon many questions, but he could not join In the proposed vote of censure, because he did not see anything to justify it in the papers submitted to the House. And let the House oonsider what the consequences of such a vote would be as regarded China. (Hear, hear.) The House should recollect that the Chinese would get intelligence of any decision in that House adverse to the British authorities in China as soon as the British residents in that country. From his own knowledge of the Chinese and the best information that he couli colect from those who were thoroughly acquainted with them, he would not undertake to be responsible for British property or British lives if the motion were agreed to. (Hear, hear.) It was upon these grounds that he earnestly called upon the HIouse to reject it.
Lord R. CECIL said, it was not his province to defend the hon. member for the West Riding against the envenomed attack of the hon. member for liverpool with reference to the part which the merchants of that town had taken in this matter, but hel would observe that what the hon. member for the West Bidin realUy charged those gentlemen with was their having asked the Government to lend them the aid of ships of war to enable them to force their way into all the rivers of China. That request was undoubtedly the most extraordinary ever heard of and which none but a barbarous Government couad concede. (Hear, hear.) Thc merchants of Liverpool had, in effect, asked the Government of this country to conumence an internecne war in China. (Hear, hear.) Frequent reference had been made to the somewhat sanguinary proclamation of Governor Yeh. The House had been repeatedly assured by the noble lord at the head of the Government that we were not at war with China. If so, then we are conducting a bucaniering expedition. (Hear, hear.) But if it should happen that war were proclaimed by us against China, was the proclamation of Governor Yeh very different from that whii6h might be expected to issue from the Brltish Government? (Hear.) Governor Yeh had tralystated that we had slain multitudes of the Cbinese, and had battered down houses over theheads of many of his countrymen, and, under these circumstances had he not a right -when no proclamation of war had been issued before hostilities to treat us as mere buecniers? The last speaker seemed to assume that the Arrow was a British vessel. He (Lord R. Cecil) was not going to enter into the legal part of the question, but he thought that it lay in a nutshell, and was open even to a layman's apprehension. (Hear, hear.) The learned Lord-Advocate tried to escape rom the inevitable consequences of asserting that it was truly a British vessel by enterinz largely into questions of municipal and international law. If the learned Lord-Advocate's position were correct, we miht claim to cover every Chinese ship with a British fag. But it could not be questioned that the ordinance of Hongkong declared that no British shi or vessel whatsoever should be at liberty to enter Chinese rivers unless provided with a certificate in conformity with the imperial acts in that behalf. It had been made abundantly clear that the Arrow was not a registered vessel, be. cause 14 days before the search took place her register had expired. But they were told that it Would be absurd to suppose that if a ship were at sea, or in a stress of weather, she should forfeit herr rater. Nobody, however, could pretend that the Arrow was at sea, or in a stress of weather, when her register expired. She had been yin idle in a Chinese river for many days before
e registry expired. No effort was made to get her registry renewed, and therefore all the special pleading that they had heard about the injustice of foretng aship's register while she was at sea or prevented

veel) read the histosry of recent times, it had appeared to him that of latenyears the conduct of our representatives had frequently inflicted upon us serious loss, and had more than once brought us to the verge of war. lIn the ease of Ears, the womanish pettishness of our ambassador lost for our ally one of the most Important cities of Asia;- a little later the misconduct of another ambassador nearly involved us ins9 war, the guilt of which, as it had been well said, would have amounted to fratricide; and even now we did not know how far we had been involved by a new Helen in Plersia. If instead of backing up our plenipoteutiaries we did not impose a check upon them, there was no saying to what extent they igt otda7 our interests
or engagge us in hostilitie's,. SI_nca-`the'da%ys of Clive our Indian policy had been so equivocal, to ue no stronger term, that in Persia, in Burmah, and in China our first advances were ropelled with horror and indignation, because it was felt that we should take the first opportunity of pickdng a quarrel and encroaching upon the rights of the native Government. If, instead of this, we could gain a character for honour, for trth, and for justice our way in the East would be smoothed, and such a character would do more to induce the jealous Chinese to open their ports to us than would all the force and violence which we mnight employ against them.
Sir C. NAPIER had so high an opinion of the moderation, humanity, and discretion of Sirl ichael Scymour that he would not for a moment believe that that gallant ofricer would have fired one unnecessary shot against the Chineae. He was certain that Sir Michael Seymour was conscientiously convinced that the Arrow was to all intents and puroses a British vessel. It was said that her license was out,
t he could not understand how that license could have expired until her return to the port from which she had saile. It was said the Chinese did not know that the Arrow was a British vessel. He did not care whether theykneoit or not; the British flag was flying and they hauled it down. What was demanded? They were only asked to send back the men in the same public manner in which they had taken them away-not to send them back in a sneaking private way-and to make an apology. Good God! Was there anything extraordinary in that? If a man hbA his hat strack off, or was knocked down, he was entitled to an afology. Wo had only asked for an apology, and that was re used by the Chinese Government. When Fance was at war with Mexico the French Admiralin a hasty andl improper manner went on board an En.glish man of war and took the pilot out by force. He remembered perfectly wel that he officer on the station and the admiral were Tery ill thoug'ht of for not resent-

("No.") The commander-in chief wa bound tousehis own disretion, and if he thought Sir 3. Bowriug was doing wrong itwas his duty to refuse'to refuse to obey any orders from him. (Hear, bear.) It might bave been better to have seized a war junk, and kept it uanti reparation was made, but there was no war junk there, and if Sir M. Seymour hadpocketed the afont, the Chine8
authorities and the authorities of other nations would have said, "WhaameansrpixiteamantbisBritihofflcerin Hehas seen the Bitish flag hauled down before his face, and he has not the courage and resolution to reent it." They must regret that the lives of innocent people should have been sacrifcedr, though there did not appear to have been much loss of life in this unfortunate ffaair ; but if there had bee

Bowfng concealed the facts of the case from the Chinese. It w was true Sir 3. Bowrorghs arestch said the lorchA could not be legally protected, an the Chinese did not knowr it, but it did not proceed to instruct Consul daid es not ht tell the Chines. Sir 3. Bowrin did something wtorsa. Having written that despatch toMr Consul rarkes on the 13th of October, he wrote to Commissioner Yeh on the 14th of November,-" There is no doubt that the loscha Arrow lawfuly bore te British flag under a register granted by me." The hon. member for Taunton (Sir J. oamrde) spoke of ithas an error on the nart of Sir t. Bowring. meaning that it as an error on rhas part to doubt whetthehe Arrow could be legally protected. But that did not alter the morl bearing of the question. Sir a. Bownng believred that the Arrou could not be leCally Arotected, apn euette, and the pme waiventhat the flag. The HIoDs might be willing topardon an error which was not intentional, but it was a different thing to endorse an error which involved the delioerato statemeut of that whic'h wfasnot tree. (Cheers.) At the present moment we were not fightingxabout the lorcha Arrow, but really wvhether Sir J. Bowng should or should not be carried in triumph tothe gates of Canton. Sir C.Boinwes original demands were that the men should beretarned, that a prontse should be givento better observe the treaties i future, and that an apology should bmade. On the 24th of October the 12 men were returned, though not received by Consul Parkes on a point of etiquette, and the promise was given that the treaty should not be riolated in fture. The noble lord the member for the city of London-no mean ludge of the requirements of British honour-thought it had been susticiently vindicated. Four Cbinese forts had been stormed c ad occupied, and therefore on the 24th of October any reasonable man would have thousght there was a possibility of a peaceable settlement. Ithseemed f if that dreadful supposition dawnedontthe mind of Sir J. bewreing (hear, hear), for he immediately wrote to Sir a Sem mour, sgrgesting that circumstances were auspicious to bring forward a fresh demand. He thought, on the contrasy, circumstances were extremely in. auspriious for seeking entry into Canton, when we had just been destroyig the forts and abusing the Government of that city. (Hear, hear.) But the secret was thatSirs.' Dowsring wfas bent on sei.zing the first op;eortunitzr, just or unjust, good or bad, to realize the object of his darling hopes. From the firmt uappy moment of his appointment Sir 3. Bowzing had become possessed by what had been Justly termed a monomania for vetting into the dmty. Cattioned by Lord GranviUle and snubbed by Lord MIalmesbury, he shll pursued his object. In 1852 he wrote adres ateh remonstratn against the mest wise cartion of Lord Granv,lle, hntic concluded in these terms :-" demonstation my be useful, ut I do not antcipatedisasters." He was prepared, however, to run the risk of disasters for the sake of objects which Sir J. Davis and Sir G. Bonham had abandoned, w hich had been repudiated by the noble lord, at the heald ofthe Government, and the attempt to obtain which bad been censured by other Secretaris of State
No doubt our Government was bound to support its agents when they faithfnUly adhered to their directions;* but in this
crotchet of his sive Administrations. Hte had also ventured to usurp the prerogative of the Crown, by declaring war ithout a re rerence to his superiors at home, It cwas idle to say we were not at war with China, when it was admitted that vo
fere not fighting about the lorcha, hut for the foluoient of atreaty. It was said, too, that we were not revenyg one isolated insult, but a long series of insults. The hen. member for Taunton (Sir 3. amden) deserved credit for his selection, in support of this assertion, of a single extract-amere han billcirculated at Canton without any sign of its being an official document. A list of the various insults offeredi by the Chinese since the conclusion of the treaty of NaDkin appeared. in the blue-books. They amounted to 37in sUlin a period of 14 years; and what were these outrages which were piled on the back of the lorcha dispute to make It big enough to justify our violence? Two of the alleged injuries were actually insults offered by Englishmen to the Chinese, not by the Chinese to Englishmen; and another two were American cases, with which this country had had nothing to do. In short, when fairly examined, it turned out that only 22 of the entire catalogue of 37 insults were instances in which the Chinese had attacked Englisbmen? and that in every one of them our suaccessive pletiipotentiaries. down to Sir 3. Bovring himself, had been satisfied with the reparation made by the Chinese authorities. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, unable to meetthe cogentargumentsof the hon memberfortheWest Rliding, had talked largely about our national honour; and the Wire-President of the Board of Trade had also put him. self forward as though he were the only man in the House who respected the flag of his country. He ventured to tell the latter right hon. gentleman that hon. members who meant to vote for thls motion did not yield to him in patriotic sentiments, but believed they would best preserve the honour of Englad untarniahed, besd maintain respect for her.flag, by entering their earnest protest against a policy which combined, in an unnatural alliance, the insolence of power and the duplicity of weakness. (Hear, hear.) It was said that In dealing with an Oriental nation we must be prompt to resent an affront and never recede from any posiuon we took up. But the legitimate influence of England in the East rested not les upon her reputation for truth and justice than upon the dread of her power. Two oppositej lines of policy were open to us in ouLr intercourse with a Government like that of China. One was the policy of peace and forbearance which had been pursued with so much suCcess for the last 15 years, andinder.which our trade had so enormously increased. The oter was the Bowring policy, which sought by violenoe and deception to enforco rihts which Sir G. Bonham told us would be of no use if conceded, and which would entail on us inevitable dissensions and dangers. The demand of Sir J. Bowring to be admitted personaUy to Canton was avowedly made as only a step towards securing the recognition of the right of all British subjects to enter that city. But our plenipotentiary was not satisfied with the mere fulfilment of the treaty of 1842 in this repect; for in his letter to M. de Courcy he spoke of requiring "the revision of the treaties." TheHousewasmuchindebted to the disingenuousnessof the hon. member for Liverpool (Mr. Horafall) for disclosing the real objects of his constituents. They wished our Government to demand that British vessels of war should be admitted into the porte and rivers of Canton. If we insisted on any such condition China must cease in any intelligible sense of the word to be an independent nation. That, however, would be the natural consequence of Sir J. Dowsing's policy. (Elear, hear.) He intended, therefore.
so vote Mr this motion, becanse it passed a cen
sure on the conduet of our representative in China. If the Government should succeed in defeating this motion he hoped it would at least have the good effect of teaching them to be careful for the fature whom they selected as their representatives in distant colonies. (Hear.) Somo gentlemen were appointed governors of colonies because it was inconvenient forthem to live in England, others because nothin better turned up for them here; and he had heard it sail that some had been appointed because, as members of that House, they had proved themselves such insufferable bores that everybody was glad to get them out of bearing. (Laughter.) He hoped no more such appointments would be made for the future. (Hear ) If such a system were persisted in, tue time must speedily come when we should have either to take possession permanently of the Chinese ports, or to abandon altogether all the objects of this long contention. In giving his vote for the motion his object was to express his condemnation of aw policy which was inconsistent with the honour and contrary to the interests of England, and o visit with the censuroof Parliament the conduct of officials who had acted in defiance of theirinstructions in, order t carry out-crotchets of their own. (HIear, hear.)-
Mr. BENTINCK said that, taking the remolution before the House as an abstract proposition, there was no doubt that the facts of the case, as disclosed in the blue-books, completely justified it; but he did not think that he should be doing his duty if he allowed himself to give an abstract yes or no upon it without looking to the ulterior consequences which it might entail. So far as Sir T. Bowring and Conaul Parkes were concerned, he was prepared to acquiesce
in all the censurewhich was passed upon them, and to say that the sooner they were dismissed the better; but he was bound to look at the efect whih this resolution might have upon other persona besidee them, The bon. member for LIverpool waa a, g reat authority as tothepositionof the

I am. an.unlearnied man, but Ilay this that if a solicitor or a proctor were intrusted by me with acm based on a will, parporting to be a last will by which tho testatorbequeathed any thig to me, and if he in the course of she suit became
acquainted with the fact that that was not the last wilL i but that there was a subsequent document subversive of ray claim, and if e proceeded, even as my agent, to enforce my claim, suppressing the fact of the later will, he would, asa matter ofcourre, if practiLing at Doctors'-nnmmous, at once with ignominy cease to be &proctor, and if at commaon law he would be struck off the rolls. (Hear, hear.) Why, in the case of the humblest practitioner m the lowest tribunal in England such falsehood and such proceedings as I have pointedout would not be tolerated for a moment, aud yet Her Majesty's Government advise Her Majesty not only to cover and approve that transaction, but to leave in the exercise of full power and authority, in the most critical circumtaces, and at that distant part of her dominions, an officer convicted by himself of that which would occasion the degradation of the lowest member of the law in this country. (Cheers.) That is the questiou of law- now let me for a moment turn to the question of policy. It is clear that, after, all, as you may well imagine, the affair of the lorcha Arrow was but a pretext for nlterior ends. SupPOse that the Chinese had erred in that transaction, the smailest reparation for such an error might easily have been accepted. -According to the principle of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tootn, a junk would have been admirable reparation for a lorchs. lot so, hoWever, thought Sir J. Bowring; and those who have read these papers must see plainly that he was bent upon obtaining a trLumph where al before him had failed in the disputed question of access to the interior of Canton. He was bent on being received into that city amidadmirin4hundredsof thousands, surroundedwithaUlthe pomp and circumstance of a public triumph, tomtoms accompanyimg him, peacocks' feathers surrounding him, and althe attendant glories of a triumphal entry in his train. (A laugh.) Middle terms were offered to him. Outside the gate of the city, in the suburbs frequented by the British merchants, Yeh offered him a meeting, but he repu-diated that, and he says deliberately that this disputed point was to him a matter of primary importance, with the niew, as he considered, of promoting British interests. He terms it the vatca qudtio, and it is a question which had -occupied the attention of many ot his predecessrs, and vhich had been considered by four or five Secretaries of Stateinsuccession. Whenthenobleviscountnowatthehead -of the Government was at the Foreign-office in 1847, the first despatch which wasawritten bybimonthisssubject was couched somewhat in mnenacing terms; but, after a littlo reflection, the noble viscount exercised, in my humble judgment, the wisest discretion on the point. He saw; the immonsity of the danger, and the comparative smallness of the object to be attained; he knew the mighty interests at stake; he thought it inexpedient, therefore, that any risk should be run, and he wrote to Sir G. Bonham for answers to oertain questions before giving any orders on the subject. Sir J. Davis,- who preceded Sir G. Bonham, had alre"4y given an opinion upon it. He was inolined to enforce the strict terms of the treaty, and to insist I on the nght of entry, and he sad,-"If I were to give
nect to mry own wishes I should not have hesitated to prees bhis point. Be then added this remarkable expression-" I am surrounded by navl and military offlicrs who, desirous of destinction, would, if I listened to them, press me not to hesitate." (Hear, bear.) Now, observe-that difflculty ,attends all -eperintendents in that quarter. There is a 8imilar desire also on the part of the British merchants. I won't speak of them in harsh terms, neither wil I altogether adopt the view of the hon. member for Liverpool, that in foreign countries they are at all ,times meek and gentle in their demeanour and most considerate of the feelings of other;, stil I am persuaded that the superintendent of Hongkong sp reseed fromtime to time by themerchants, by the aial and military oficers and by the English generally, to exercise a tone of command towards the Chinese which is quite inconsistent either with the safety of our trade or with our friendly relations with that country. Hear, bear.) Sir J. Davis resisted their desire. The noble viscount referred the question to Sir G. Bonham, and there are four distinct answers given by Sir .G. Bonham, in all of which he states that he should like to obtain that admission3; that he saw rnany advantages in it ; but that, on the whole, he did not think that those advantages, weighed against the dangers of a rupture with the Chine6e, predominated to an extent to justify the use of force; and he added that the destruction of anton might be involvedin the attempt to enforce the right. Upon this the noble viscount came to the decision that it would be inexpedient to press thermatter, and Earl Grey, thenhiscolleague and Secretary for the Colonies, sent out a most peremptory prohibition to the officer commanding the military forces, not only at Hongkonx, but at Ceylon, under no circumstances to allow any offensive movement against the Chinese without authority from England. Sir J. Davis and Sir G. Bonham both admitted the stringency of that order, and -Sir G. Bonhaua reminded the noble viscount of It, and stated that he was peremptorily restricted from the use of force. Sir J. Bowing, ever since he arrived at Hongkong, has fretted under that restraint, and has endeavoured to obtain a relaxation of the order. The matter has been referred to several Governments in succession, and any relaxation of the prohibition has been refused. It was first referred to the Government of the noble lord themember for London, and Earl Granville, speaking in his name refused to remove the prohibition. It wvas then brought under the consideration of Lord Derby's Government, whence two despatches proceeded, stronger, if possible, than the prohibition which was issuea by Lord Granville, ad directing Sir J. Bowriag on no account whatever to take any steps other than the course which had been pursued byhis predecessors. But Sir J. Bowring, bent on carrying his poit, had reason to think, probably, that the moment bad arrived when, consistentlywith the principles laid down in England, he might venture on that step. WNow, the last despatch written by the noble viscount upon this point does not appear to me to bc altogether so conciliatory or cautious in its tone as any of his previous letters. At page 197, and under dato the 18th of Augast, 1849, we have the last ditum of the noble lordi on this subject, couched in words which I think are very infammable, and which probable did not escape he notice of Sir 3. Bo6ring. The noble lord apeth noic
"The Chinese great officers at Canton seemto be faling again into the same mistake which was committed by their predecessors in 1839; and they appear to be encoura ing and exciting among the people of Canton hostile feelings tov ards British subjects. But let not the great bfficers of Canton nor the Government of Pekin deceive themselves on these mattem The forbearance which the British Government has hitherto displayed rises, not from a sense of weakmess, but from conaciousness of superior strength." AAnd Ibeg the House to attend to these words:-
"The British Government weU knows that, if occasion required it, a British military force would be able to destroy the town of Canton, not leavng one single house standing, and could thas inflict the most signal chastisement upon the people of that city."
Now, it may be said that this Is a distant authority to meet a contingent case; but, as I have told you, Earl Grey, Lord Granville, and LTd Malmesbury, all joined in a peremptory prohibition against offensive o,erations without previous reference to the Government st home; -nagain you find that the Duke of Newcvastle adopted the'same line of policy, and inhisdespatchthesameprohibition iscons-yedineztenso Xow, what course was adopted by L.ord Clarendon? Lord Clarendon, in a despatch dated July 5, 1854, to Sir J. Bowring, of which only an extract is given in those papers,

".It is, on all accounts, desirable that you should obtain access to the Imperial Commissionerat Canton; but there is no reason to expect that you will be more succesful in doing so than the Ministers of France and of the United States; and* on will use every precaution for asertaining, beforehand that you will not meet with any indignity that will equiire to be avenged, and this more particularly at a moment when the vai of the British naval force in the Chinese seas might not be availablefor that purpose."
NTow, what is the meaning of that ? (Hear, hear.) We were at war with Russia at that time, and the naval force of this country was much occupied in different qaarters. Well, Sir, at the time that the question of the Arrow arose SirJBowtng hadjust heard that peace hadbeenestablished and that the naval force in thoseses had been geestly augmented, and the want of a naval force was no longer an impediment. He thought thst the opportuiityhadarisen, and that the dipute about the Arrow was a fitting opportunity for caring out his vievws, and he suggests to the admiral that force should be employed to solve this vexat a utio. Now, it is very remarkable that for the fibattime, Iblieve, in naval history, not only were the naval operations suggested, bht the future course and extent of those operations were laid down by the superintendent of trade, who not only took the command of the fleet as regarded what operations were to be performed, but who laid down in most extraordinary detail the precise mode in which those operations 6hould be conducted. I don't think that the passage has been brought nuder the notice of the House, and, with its permission, I will read this most remarkable scheme of naval operstions laid down by Mr. Consul Parkes.

Sir J.GRAHAXIunderstod the riht hon. gentleman to saY that it was desired to emancipate the people of 4014ton fromn the eontrol of so Cruel a governor as Yeh.
(Ha,hear.) I really Aoahdl have thought, for my 9wn pat ht the Government 4ad had recent experience on Donsof this kind to prevent them takting such a viewr. WMes I am greatlY deceived, on point insisted upon in thze nexotiations with* PerpA Was. the deposition of the Primle Mnister of that eouhtry,- 'and, unless I am equaljly anisinformd, the BriishGave*pqnthavitfqPO*.
Mr. -Parkes's scheme of operAtionSat Cinton. In the fiiit placelhe says:- -
"TThe Imperial Commissioner, I submit, shoul again be su,moned togrint the satisfactionaliredy demande4within 24 hours, faihngwhic'h we should then takeossession of the four Barrier Forts."
After recommending the seizure of the Barrier Forts he goes on to say ;_
"I cannot conoeive it posslble that his ExceUency will tben withhold compliance with our demnands; batshould he still continue contumacious -a similar course should then be pursued with the forts at Canton, and it would be exceedDgly advisable, I think, that the, residence of his Excel. lency, which is not far from the water side, should also in that case feel the effects of the bombardment." '
So that if Yeh continued contamacious he was to be brought to his senses by having his own residence submitted to bombardment. It maynbe said that this is only a proceeding tgainst au individual, and not against the people of Canton But is tbis the case? Mr. Parkes, the Minister of Peace and Commerce, continues his instructions; and he says,-
"I advocate attack on the Brier Forts in the first Instance, because they standby themselves, and are not surrounded, as are those at Canton, by the dwellings of the people, who should be exempted, whenever it is in our powver to do so, fromn any disastrouls consequences accruing frorn the acts of their authorities, and will, it may be hoped, see the justice of offensive measures being aimned by us solely against the tatter."
Now, it is clearly shown that the dweRings about the realdence of Yoh were well known to be densely populated, and it could not but be equally well known that bloodshed to a frightful extent must ensue if the house of Yeh were bombarded. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, this plan of operations, laid downv by Mr. P*rkes, is carried into effect; but the desired effect is not produced, and then he goes further. The town is shelled, the forts attacked, snd the assault carried up to the very walls of. the city, and devastation and bloodshed to an extent frightful to cbntemplate are carried among its peaceful inhabitants. Unless I am misinformed, these mesmures were, by the last account received from China, beginniug to bear fruit. There was a divided population; there was a rebellon; but now the Chinese have rallied round their rulers, mak'ng common cause, and forgetting all their differences, and united efforts will now be made by them to defendtheir lives and their property against such a terrible vsitation. (Hear, hear.) And then as to the approbation given by the Executive Government. It is not approbation unqualed by any regret, as has been stated;. but there certairy does occur in this correspondence a passage which I confess filled me with amazement. Not only is there an entire adoption of the acts of Sir John BowrAng, and of the efforts he used, but you will find the Earl of Clarendon writing to Sir John Bowring as follows-
"I have received your despatck of the 23d of October last, with a report of the operations in the Canton river
and I have to acquaint you that Her Majesty's Govemrment entirely approve the courshewhich has been adopted by Rear-Admral Sir mtichael Seyoour and yourself; and I have to instruct you also to convoy to Mr Parkes a similar approval of his conduct."
Mr. Parkes, you wzill remember, is the gentleman who sketched out the p lan of naval operations, recommending especially the hontardment; and the Government approves his conduct also Does the matter rest there ? I own that my amazement knew no bounds when, onIthesame page of the blue-book, I found these words. Mr. Ham. mend, writing to the Seoretary to the Admipraty, is directed by Lord Olarendon to ecpress his lordship's nexre approval of Admal Seymour's conduct, "and more especialUl
the judgment, firmness, and moderation with which he has acted, and the respect which he hns shown for the lives and properties of the Chinese people," (iear, hear.) wlow the question really subrmtted taotihe Commons of Bg land is this :-Are you prepared t;o endorse the approbation of these transactions which has been expressed by oer Majesty's Government, and especially to express your admiration of the " respet w/hich has been shown for the lives and properties of the Chinese P" (CJheers.,l Sir, the House will remember the course taken wvhen we dealt with a pow erful enemy, w hose conduct was indefensible both on account of the violence of the particular act complained of, namely the invasion of the territory of a friendly Power, and the language employed by her in asserting her alleged right. I can well imane that we should have gone to the greatest lengths in avenging our wrongs in that case and in visiting upon a mighty antagonist the utmost vengeance of which modern civilization And the laws of modern warfare would allow. Well, it was a matter of severe criticism in this House that with respect to Russia an order was deliberately given by the Government that open and defenceless -cities should be spared. Odessa, on that principle, was not bombarded by Admiral Dundas; Helsingfors, on that principle was not bombarded b,v the gallant admiral below me. (hear.) Is, then, the disrespect shown to the lorchaArrow'sfiag under such doubtful circumstances a matter of such grave importance Ithat the Government deliberately approve of a depatture .rom this principle with reference to the unhappy Chinese? (Cheers.) Is the matter one of so much gravity that you not only bombard a city far more populous than either of the two I have mentioned, but mark for destruction a single house, the house of an individual, and, in order to wreak your vengeance on this individual consider the lives of the surrounding multitude as dust in the balance? (Cheers.) Myj noble friend (Lord J. Russell) remarked the other night that thelanguage of the present day was that the honour of our arms required we should fight for our prestige. The word, I should observe, comes to us from a foreign country from which we learn the value of the term- but if this be

(Hear, hear.) f however,pre-stgebe yonrob et do you think having spared Odessa, having spared kelsingfo-w, tbat it will re=ond much to the credit of our naval arms throughout Europe and the world to have destroyed the Bogue Forts and bombarded Canton ? (Cheers.) Talk of the insulting langage which has been used by foreign Powers with whom we quarrel I Why, this dotrine of insistng upon Commissioner Yeh's expulsion from the Government of Canton is far more than Prince Menechikoff ever endeavoured to effect when he was at Constantinople. (Cheers.) I say that this is one of the most dangerous lines on which the Government can begin to move (hear, hear), and it is high time, I think, to arrest our progress In sach a direction. (Hear, hear.) We have heard that at Canton there was a protesa against these proceedings. I rejoiced, Sir, to hear the protest of Russell and Co. in this House last night. (Cheers and laughter.) Russell and Co. have been heard, not at Canton, but here; and I hope the effect of that protest wil be distinctl marked in the division. (Hear, hear.) Of this, at d events, I am sure-that the speech in which that protest was entered will be memorable in our Parliamentary annals when this miserabletransaction of the lorcha shall be burled in oblivion. (Cheers.) Sir, the hop. member for Norfolk (Mr. Bentinck), who lately addressed the House, stated seve. ral reasons for the vote which he is about to give against this motion. He says it is nothing but an abstract resoluton,a resolution which he cannot controvert, and *inst which he is not prepared to argue. ("Hear, hear,' and laughter.) But the hon. member takes views of general policy, and he says that he suppoIts Her Majesty's present Government because he is most desirous of haing a Conservative Administration at the head of affairs; and with that view he thinks it is most desirable to maintain the nobleviscount at the head of the'overnment. (Cheers and laughter.) I congratulate thenobleviscountupontheuncompromising support whichthe member forNorfolkgiveshim. I amsare it must be moet agreeable to the gentlemensitting on this side of the House to know the reasons for which the hon. member thinks the noble lord more anti-Catholic and more anti-Democratic than any other Minister. (Cheers andlaughter.) I congratulate the noble lord on this support, and I congratulate the gentlemen around him on the motives upon which this Support is based. (Renewed laughter.) But the right hon. gentleman the Colonial Secretary says the resolution is very ambiguoug. Now, I must say that, looked upon by the litt of the speech which introduced it, I think thisa Wvery intellgible niotion. I think it temperate, measured, and moderate in its terms, and therefore worthy of aupport. (Cheers.) Sir, if I am driven to make my choice whether w vill ote for this resolution or be a party to that approbation of the transactions I have attempted to describe which is expresded
by the Foreign Secretary and adopted by Her Majesty's Ministers, I cannot doubt for a moment what it will be my duty to do. I, for one, wiU wash my hands of the innocent blood which, in my opinion, has been shed. (Cheers.) My belief is that these debates will thoroughly occupy the minds and wil reach the hearts of the people of England. (Hear, hear.) I amsatisfiedth3atthedivisiontowhichweareabout to go will be regarded with immense interest by the pole of this country. (Hear.) I do not think that Russell and Co. will beheld subjeetto averylimitedresponsibility. (Alaugh.) I thinkthe responsibility of that vote is near at hand, and I believe every member in this House will be caUed to an acoount for that vote. (Cheers.) Butwhatever may be the question with regard to any human tribunal (cries of " Oh, oh," from the Ministerial benches, and eheers), that is not the onl motive which influences me. In my opinion, the debate as proved that whether you regard this as a question of policy, or as a question of humanity, or whether you
regard it in connexion with the moat solemn of all considerreatins andn by tnhe Iig°ht oif outre Christiatn prinCiples (" Oh,
oh,"' and cheers), these operations at Canton are utterly indefeneible (cheers); and I never in my life gave a vote wi *th a more clear and conscientious conviction of its propriety than the veot I shall record in favour of the motion of the hon. gentleman. (Loud cheers.)e
TheATTORNEY-GENERAL said, he could not doubt that the House had a proper sense of the responsibility which attached to any hon gentleman who, in addressig it on the question under consideration, brought acusations against the British Government calculated to hold it up to the civilized world as having been guilty of a violation of the principles of jastice. He thought it should be well considered, before that was done, whether the feelings which prompted such a course might or might not be somewhat inuenced by party spirit. On the other hand, he would freely grant that those who were about to utter sentiments expressive of their conviction that what had been done in this matter was right in point of law incurred the very serious responsibility of giving utterance to opinions that would justifythe shedding of blood. Now, this question had been stated with reference tothe principles ofjustice,lhumanity, and policy. He thought the first and most important consideration was the question of whether what had beendone was consistent with justice. He should venture to answer the appeals which had been made to him, and should present at once to the House what he believed to be an analysis of those opinions that had been elsewhero delivered on the question under consideration; for, although he had great respect for the members of that Eouse as a body, and for every individual in it whose acquaintance he had the honour to enjoy, yet he could not for one moment compae their deliberations or their argumentk oen such ja subject a this. with the arguments that had been delivered in another place.

inperialSttute-book, and therefore utterly void. -That was the argument of a ioble and learned lord last night in another place. The second was that, supposing the colonial ordinance to be valid, the registry 'granted totheArrowhadexpired and was no longer in force. The third proposition, which was principally insisted on by a most venerable authority, -was that, even it the colonisl ordinancowere valid aud the regiatry good, yet thatyou could not clothe any Chinese with the right to possess a vessel of this description, or, being Chinese property, exempt it from the jurisdiction of the Emperor of China. All that they had beard iA that Houee or elsewhere fell within oae or other of those propositions, saving the commentary they had heard on the conduct of Sir John Bowring, and ho might add the welcome which the right hon. gentleman who had just sat down had anticipated for his absent friend when he entered the city of Canton amid the din of tomtoms and surrounded by poseocks feathors. Lughter.) That was the right hon. gentleman's mode of ding justice to an absent friend.
Sjr J. GRARAML-The hon. and learned gentleman is mlsrepresenting me. I did lay claim to an intimate friendship for Sir Michael Seymour, but I did not put iu any such
laim of friendship for Sir John Bowring. (Laughter.)
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said, the expression the right hon. gentleman used undoubtedly was tbat he claimed the merit of having to speak on the part of Sir John Bovring. ("No, nol") He (the Attorney.General) would, however, pass from those topics to others which bore more immediately on the question under consideration. He was desirous of laying before the House what he believed to ba a correct exposion of the law on the subject, and in the briefestposscble compass. First of all, he believed this question had been put altogether on an erroneous basis when the title of the Arrow to the character of a British slip was rested on the validity of the colonial ordinance. It ddnot rest on that at all; and the Colonial ordinance and the registry granted under it were, in point of fact, wholly immoi
teral to tho question. The title of the Arrow to the cha-
racter of a British ship rested on the treaty with the. Chinese. He mnst there notice a serious error attibaed by the newspapers to a noble and learned lord in another place, who contended that by international law the Arrow, if she had been under the same circumstances in the Thames, would have been visited by the authorities and the offenders in the vessel taken away by them. That noble and learned lord must have known that 'if it had not been for this treaty the Arrow or any other merchant ship at Canton was liable to be visited by the Chinese authorities. (Hear, hear.) When a merchant ship entered the harbonr of another country those who vwere on board of her were obliged to conform to the laws of that conntry; and, if there were among her crew any offenders against the municipal law, it was competent for the authorities of that country at once to enter the vessel and to bring them to justice; and un. doubtedlythe Chinese authorities might bave dealt witk the Arrow in a similar way if it had not been for the treaty in question. The whole of the argument of the noble and leafned lord on that point, therefore, was based on a simple error. Now, the House would observe that the supplementel treaty described exactly the class of vessels to which the Arrow belonged; and by a stipulation between Eugland and China those vesels were built for the purposes of their local coasting trade. The 17th, or additional article of the supplemental treaty. provided that "Every British schooner, entter, lorcha. &c, shall have a sailing letter or register in Chinese and English undertthe seal and signature of the chief superintendent of trade, desrbing her zppearance, barden, &rc.t' Every lorchatherefore receiving ttat seElnd letter vas, by the verytemis and conditions of that treaty, converJow into a British lorcha. (" Oh, oh!l" from the Opposition.) That was not the wray to meet a legal ganrment. vHears
The words in the supplementary treaty were "everyvBritish schooner, cutter, lornia, lc., shall haves sailing letter or register in Chinese and English under the seal and eigna. tureoPthe Chief Superintendent of Trade." He repeated, therefore, that as between England andChina, everylorche
producing under the hand and seal of SirJ.Bowring a seailing letter or register was entitled by the terms of the treaty to the character and privileges of a British vesseL (Hear, and cries of "Oh!e) That was an international stipulation, but the colonial ordinance was nothing more than a municipal regulation for our own municipal purposes. That municipal law was a part of our own peculiar law, hut tbe contract bewheen us and the Chines, was expressed in the treaty, and Because the land,s answered the reouirements ofgh e municipal law she becameeentitledtothebeneft of the treaty. Whatever assumed the character of a British merchant vessel was a vessel within the meaning of the treaty (hear, heaz), and ras entitled to the pnvilege of not being ewtposed to ha a ison baor also yt the Chinese authorities, but was entitled to the protection of the British consul, and could only ha over-
auied through that medium. If that were so, what became of the argument th ththe lorcha did not answer the subordinlaeipations of the colonial regulations? That argument had been foanded upon a sapposition tha the sailing license of the Arrowr was not in conformity writh the colonial ordinance. He said with great sabmission, but also with sonhdence, and with the awthority of the man most versed in international lrw to be found in this cofntsy, that the colonial ordinanco, being a matter of municipal law, could not be invoned by the Chinese, whether the vessel had abided by or violateh the terms-of that ordinance, they being bond b,r the languageof the treaty, (lear bhear.) Before quitting the sauect of the treaty he wisted to explain what he conceived to hao been mxeant in the Imperial statute by the terms Brithsh rsip," or a " ship entitled to a British register," because he wished to shao tha the Arrow,d lthough only possessing a colonial register, was entitled under the terms of he treaty to the denomination of a British vesseL. There bad beenr considerable confusion and, he togt
Sispping ere onferred The terma British shin coraing within pclardenomination, had beTen introduced into our law by the old navigation laws. It was a purely technical term, not meaning what ras commonly understood by those I ords-ti., a ship beonging to a British subject, but avesselentitledto al the pivilees and advantages wh ch by the old navigation lsw nd the present oerchant Shipping Act were conferred upon such vessels-a ship coming within certain peculiar Ilmts. There might be a British ship built ina foreign country, manned bye foreign
crew, wthic did not ful&i in any respect the conditions of the Imperial statute, but which would still be a British merchant ship in the sense that she was the property of a British subject. The words "British ship or E3nglish merchant vessel" were plainly used in the supplementary treaty, not in the technical senss given to those wrords in the Imperial statute, but in the general, universa sense of a vessel belonging to a British subject. It must be observed that he expressly used the term "British subject," and not "Britlsh.born subject," which were tho words of the ferchant Shipping Act; and by British subject he meant a person resident in somo part of the British territory and living under British rule. In that sense only was the term" English merchant ship" in the supplementary treaty to be interpreted. That wLs renderedabundantlyplaini thetreaty was readbythelanguag) Of the 17th article, because no one could suppose that such small vesels as cutters, schooners, or lorchas, being merely coasters, could at all comply with the requisites of the Irmperna statute. (Hear, hear.) It wzs plain that by the 17th article of the treaty a vessel falfilling certain requirements was to all intents and prposes entitled to the protection Oven by the treaty to Englis merchantaahips. The Honse
ad been told that the colonial ordinance was in violation of the Imperial statute, and that all the privileges and adantages proposed to be bestowed upon lorchas were in contravention of the Imperial statute. The error would be obvious if it were borne in mmd that the proper interpretation of the words " British ship"wapueytcnalad he (the Attorney-General) asserted that it never was intended to apply thos words to the supplementary treaty, where, in fact, they were not to he found, and would be inapplicable to the clas of vessels there spoken of.

(Bear.) If he had expresd himself consecutively and intelligibly he should have no difcultY in convincing the House that three th;igs aPeared plainly on the treaty.
The fitrt was that it was not competeint to toh Chinese authorities to deYn to Ay eseml that had once received a smling register iagned by the SuPerintendent at Hongkong, which bad been owned bY a British subject, th haracter and privileges of a British merchoant vessel in the Chinese waters. The next point was, that it was not com-
petent to the Chinee authorities to set UP the colonial ordlinances, or any violation or non-obseervace of the colonial ordinances, as a reason why they shoud not furinl their owntreaty sti ulations whichdid nootembodytheprovisions of thecolunialordinances. So that al the arguments they
had heard about the colonial license not having been renewed, or about the prrticular terms or want of endorsement of the colonial license, were not matters in which the Chinese were concerned, but which they were precluded from calling to their defZence by the stipulations of the treaty. Two thisga were therefore tolerably plain- first, that -a noble and learned lord in anotber place was totally wrong wrhen he -lupposed that the colonial ordinance was altogether inconsistent with the imperi%l statute ; and, secondly, that that maoss fertile topic* Of reclamation upon which so)aUCheloquencein that House and elsewhere had been employed, that the colonial register of the Arrow had expired or was irregular, was *,toi'a which it was not competent for the ChinLeso to briig fr ward, which could not lie in thei n ioutbhs and which was

eagreed in that: proposition,
and as the law officer of the Crown durinr. the last three or four sears. lie had frequently had occauon to ppeal to and to enforce the same principle; for he was sorry to say that a great part of our municipal legislation was conducted in a manner that ignored the existence of inte nutioulalaw. (Hear.) 1Under theAlien Act general ,letters of naturalizsktion were granted to Austrians, to Frenchmen, to Italians, and to Turks, and every other eubject of every other kingdom. Theseltters of naturaliza, tion were without' qualification, as if they could convert a
uk into a British subject, as ainst the rights of the Sultan, and am AushiLn into a BritiA subject as against the xghts of the Emperor of Ausftria. But no man would pretend to Bay that the Chinese owner of this vessel might not be answerablefor any act aainat his ratural sovereign, contrary to his allegianoe. T e present, however, waa a very different inquiry. The question here was whether, if a natiural-born subject of the Emperor of China became resident in the, colony of Hongkong, and there became subjectt oar allegince, we might not without violation of tho freaty make hmtshe owner of a0hip.snd inve him a sailing 'register, he being resident ivithin our terrtory, and in that sense the Qaee's subject and whether he, as the owner of :that vcsel, would not be withdrawn temnorarily from the authority of, th Emperor of China and his ship entitled fo the privileges of a British-owned vessel. It was a ingulir thing tbat the case about which they had seard so mucll general reasoning had actually occurred in the Courts of this countr and ha en ecided there. The same proposition would be found in almost every writer, on internutional lar. Anhon baronet, whom he always heard with great and singular pleasure, and tovwhom he was under great obligations, both or his 'speeches and writings, had cited Wheaton as an authority in support of his viow. But if the hon. baronet referred to this author he would find a proposition which exactly bore out the view that he (the Attorney-General) had advanced. This proposition, deduced from all the writers on international law, and supported by a 'decion of the courts was, this, that although the subject of snothercountry could notin this country so far put off hs original character and divest himself of his natural bond of 'leegsance as not to be answeraole to his natural sovereign for any act done in derogatioL of that allegiance, yet that ho mignt become by residence or adoption so far a subject of another country as to be admitted to all the privileges and entitled to all the rights enjoyed by the subjects of that country. (Hear, hear.) In the case decided in the courts British subjects had been forbidden by law to engage in a particular trade. Certain British subjects, however, settled in the. United States and became residents there, and they then claimed to be allowed to engage in this trade as residents in the United Statc". The claim, therefore, was to exercise the privilege of that commerce which as British subjects they were forbidden by British law to carry on. In the Eighth Term Reports, in the case of I Marryatt and Wilson;" the propo. uition was laid down by Chief Justice Byro, that although a British subject was bound by sttutes, yet that in respect of a British sabject who had been resident in: th e ted States, and had become a subject of the United Stat, he was entitled to all the privileges of a subject of the United States inrespect to the enjoyment of these privileges of trade. The same point also arose in another stage of the same case, when it came before a court of error in this country; and it was remarkable that the noble and learned lord, who insisted on this topic in another place, was not aware of this authority. In that case a direct answer was given to all the noble and learned lord's reasoning; and the answer involved the very point now before the Housenamely, whether a native Chinese, becoming a resident in Hongkong, might not, so long:a he was resident there, and therefore a British subject, become the owner of a ship registered at Hongkong, so that that ship should be entitled by the treaty between England and China to all the prvileges accorded to ahips by that treaty. The opinions given in the case were delivered by the greatest authorities -by Lord Stowell, Lord Eldon, rand Lord Redesdale, then William Scott, John Scott, and John Mitford; and they put the very point almost in the very language used by the noble and earned lord In another place. They say the point was submitted to Lord Hardwicke In the case of a Scotchman, the master of a Swedish ship, navigated by Swedish mariners, who was made burgher of Stockholm. Lord Hardwicke, then Sir Philip Yorke, thought this would not entitlethe Scotchman to be considered as a Swede in Gret Britain. (Opposition cheers.) That was an opinion stated in argument, and unsuccesfully. (linisterial cheers.) It was deliberately overthrown by the judges of England in the Exchequer Chamber, who held that a foreigner, going to another country, and becoming domicUed there, might become tho o-wner of a shiD of that country, so as to entitle himself in his own native country to the privilies accorded to ships of the country in which he was domiciled. (Cheers.) Let that decision be applied to the present case. It was said that this Cbinese was attempted by the British authority to be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of his natural Sovereign, and that such a thing was imposible. Why, it was perfectly true that, In a criminal sense, he could not be so withdrawn, but it was equally true that by international law, by the British municipal law, and by the lasw of every country, a natural born subject was permitted to become resident in another country, and to acouire municinal rights and privileges under the law of that country, which were not considered inconsistent with his natural allegiance, though he could not be withdrawn from the bond of allegsance,.so as to enable him to act in violation of the duty ne owed his natural Sovereign. If this matter was argued before the noble and learned lord he would venture to say that that eminent man, whose candour was equal to the wonderful attainments and great elevation of his mind, would admit that he was wrong in his proposition because the singularity of the circumstances was this-thai the noble and learned lord, while contending that by the British municipal law a man could never bo withdrawn from his natural allegiance, so as to make the native-born Chinese owner of a British ship, forgot that by the Merchant Shigping Act the right was assumed to do that ve2y thing. (Hear, hear.) Accordingly that Act required that a British ehip should be owned either bby a natural-born subject or by a person havin letters of denizenation, or having been naturalizel and havng taken the oath of allegiance. But if the doct-ine contended for by the noble and learned lord wero correct in the way in which It was enounced, then the British municipal law pretending to give that privilege was just as great a violation of the law of nations as the proposition against which the noble and learned lord was directing his argument. (Hear, hear.) The fact was that the whole of the arpinent adduced elsewhere with all the talent and learmnng which could illustrate the subject was brought forward to maintain the three poiats be had now gone through; and he ventured to say that whoever looked at all the circumatancee of the case would agree in thinking that no single proposition maintainedin another placehad theleast application. Now, it was surprising and adittle humiliating--even hon.andrlght hon. gentlemen who were so anxionsto dojustice to theirabsent friend (" hear," and laughter) would be inclined to admit that it was a little hard to denounce Sir John Bowring as having been guilty of error on this point on which Lord Lyndhurst was at variance with Lord Wensleydale (hear, hear), and Lord St. Leonard's was in direct opposition to the Lord Chancellor. (LAughter and cheers) 'Ws Sir J. Bowring to be visited with the thunder of that House, though he was protected by his friends (a laugnh, because he was ignorant on this particula point, and beheeid that as the Arrow. vas sailing under a register in conformity with the stipulations of the treaty, therefore, the Chinese were bound by the compact to give it the immunity of a British ship? (Hear, hear.) Sir J. Bowring did nrhtly, then, and justly in upholding, in conformity with the national honour, that treaty, and in vindicating the ship's title to the privileges accorded by the treat`. iCheers.) But it wa s id that the Government should nave been better instracted, and should not have endorsed the error of Sir J. Bowring. What did the Govermment do? Sir J. BD)wring sent over all the despatches, and made full and ;cnple communication of the circumstances. What5 then, became the duty of Lord Clarendon ? Our tonstitiitional practice had provided the Foreignoffice with a re-ogpized legal assistant, not a member of the Administration, nor dependent on the caprice of Government, but uslected for his ability and his attainmenb, and made the permanentadviserof theForelgn-offlice. (Hear.) Lord Clarendon laid the whole of these papers before the Queen's Advocate-the very functionary who was selected by the Government of Lord Derby, and a better choice Lord Derby's Government could not have made. (Hear, hear.) These pipers were laid before that officer in order thatiie,the properadviser.mightdirect the Government what to do on thislegol point. The opinion of the Queen'sAdvocate was contained ii the despatch dated the lOsh of Decembor. Those hon. gentlemen who were cognizant of the practice of the Foreign-offiece knew very well that the opinion was copied into the despatch, and yet poor Sir J. BowTing (k laugh) was held up here to ridicule and reproach by those who assumed the right to criticize hi; conductk and had been stabbed in the back by his familiar acquaintances. (Cheers and laughter.) The expression used in Sir J. Bowring's letter was reiterated by the legal adviser of the Foreign-office, not a member of
theAdninistration, who said, and in his (the AttorneyGeneraPs) opinion most rightly-for he endorsed the opinion faoy-that "the expiration of the Arrow's sailing license on September 2, previbus to her seizare, does not appear to have been known to the Chinese anthorities; and this again is a matter of British regulation which would not justify seizure by the Chinese." eb had not the honour of Sir J. Bowring.s cquhintance, but he had seen a great deal of the despatohes of that gentleman, and he might venture, without any breach of duty, to state that if he were inclined to say anything for his absentfriend it would undoubtedly be this, thst from all he had seen he (Sir J. Bowrin") was disposed greatly to celestialize-to maintain what h e though; to be the just rights and interqsts of China. HIe the Attornoy-General) faid this because it had been imputed to Sir T. Bowring that he wanted to gratify an ambition at the expense of the Chinese. Upon the great question as to the Shanghai duties, Sir J.wowing distinguished himself by the manner in which he advocated what he eonceived to be the sights of the Chinese, the recognition of which rights lIe believed would eminestly conduce to the advanoement of British intrests (Hear, hear.) And now with respect to the proper meaning of the letter which Sir J. Bowring wrote with ree to the Arrow. One of my hon. friends who took part in the debate of this evening mentioned the legal phrase, non reus ci maew 7nWa faci reum. We must mquire in this *ase what was the animus with which the Chinese boarded the lorchs. Was there in that act the tnens ssiaca which cnstitutes guilt? If the Chinese had been aware of the special pleading exuxes now brought forward to justify them, and the objections to the registy of the lorcha, they might have fairly said, "We have entered the veMel believing that we had a right todo so."

Bowxiugngexant.to Fay that when the Chinese boarded theArrow and tore down onr flag they intended to insult'is (kironifa cheers from the Ozpposition), and that it made' no difference, as far as the insult was concerned, whether the register had expired or not. (Cries of " Oh, oh!' and cheers.) Would any hon. and learned meniber venture to say that it was not a principle of international law that if a man committed an outrage upon another without a knowledge of facts which taight justify it he was liable to reprsals as if those facts had no existence? Take the case wbich he put a while ago. Ile believed that in America there was-some himitation to the period within which' a vessel could car the national flag. When tbe Chinese fired upon the American ships, beivntte tobe Ame. rican ahipsz with the American ensign fylng at the mast-
ha,coula We imagine-that our- high-spirited brethren on the other aide of the Atlantic wrould have forborne to make immediate reprisals if it bad been alleged that, uknbwn to the Chine3e, the libert of carry ing the American f had expired? (ear hear.) Was that to be the rue of those whorepresent,Britain abroad? Were theyto stop before they resented an insult, in order to discover a.groundwhichthoaPinsultingthes
never could have discovered? The very essence of an insult consisted in the animtus of thepersonwhoofferedit, and he was perfectly ready to adopt Sir 3 Bowing's opinion, that it made no difference as to the course to be followed demanding redress for the insult that the liense of the lorcha had expired if the Chinese had beea intent upon insulting the British flag. e quite agreed too with Sir . Bowring, that it rested with the Government which had granted tihe register to determine whether or not the register remained in force; and if the vessel were bond fede returning to, her port where the register miight be renewed, but owing to a stress of weather were detamned, so that the license expired in the interval, it was for-the Governmenit to decide -whether she was still entitled to be regarded as a registered vesse. That was Sir J. Bowring's view, and he said, "The Chinese did not know at the time that the license had expired, and if they had known it it was a matter for our vonside. ation and not for theirs." (Hear, hear.) Thus stood the ase, and although it was easy to say that it was a matter of small moment, that we were makng a mountain of a* molehil, and that we were going to war about a trumpery lorcha, yet, if there was a deliberate insult offered to the Brtish
ag, what ought Sir J. Bowring to have done? No doubt, the fact of the expiry of thelicense paced him inadiffioulty because it enabled the Chinese authorities, who hd ated upon totally different grounds, to raise a nibble on t-he point- but he (the Lord-AdvocAte) contended that great Iatituae was to be allowed under such circumstances to those who were on the spot, and he could not forget that while people in this country were discussing the conduct of our plenipotentiary abroad that conduct had met with the approbation of every per on, not a Chinese, who Was upon tho spot. It had been ap proved by the British admiral, by the French admira and by the Americans. If the French and Americans thought that we had been precipitate they would have said FO; but tho fact was, that there was no one who was cognizant of the proceedings as they arose who did not regard the ste which our representatives had taken as perectly jy ble. Moreover, there was scarcely a man who had a practical knowledge of the subject, and who bad been inCChina and knew the Chinese, who would say that Sir T. Bowring had acted wrongly. ("H Hear, hear," and " Oh Pj) He believed that those who were connected with the China interest were all but unanimous in that view, and he did not think that such a general concurrence of. opinion could have arisen if there were not something more important in the times and circumstances of the affair than the mere meizin-
of a lorcha. The noble lord the member for London satod on the previous evening that the Government, in their despatches. had expressed no fceelng of sorrow or regret for theebloodshedtlhathadt.a.enplace. He(theLord-Advocate) did not think that any such expression was necessary. It was impossible for any ono to view without regret the bombardment of ruch a town as Canton, but he did not see thst it was requisite to give utterance to the sentiment. If the Government believed that the British representative had acted properly it was their duty to support him publicly, and not to condemn himeitherwithunjust sgpicion or faiat praise. (Hear.) He did not say thateverypersonwould have acted precisely as Sir J. Bowrlng had done in the matter; but the moment was one of great trial, requiring promptitude and decision of action, and he contended that down to the peiod of the seizing npon the lorcha there was nothing in tev conduct of our representatives which the House could condemn. This brought him to the second part of the case-did we adopt unreasonable measues upon the seizing of the lorcha? No doubt the seizing of a lorcha was a small beginning for a great war - but every one was aware that, in dealing with Orienal's, it was a most dangerous thing to neglect small beginnings, and that if we submitted to trifling injuries and insults more important ones would folloW before long. Above all things, unless we showeda jealous sensitiveness of anything that was intended as an insult it would be impossible to keep our footing there. Upon this point he would read one sentence from the work of M. Huc on the Chinese mpirc, who, writing dispassionately upon the subject, said :-
" We have observed elsewhere that the Chinese, and especiaUlly the (mandarins, are strong againsk the weak and weak against the strong. To domineer over and crush all around them LiS the object they oonstantly have in view, and to attain it they have an inexhaustible resource in their native cunning and pliability of character. Once allow them to get tho upper hand, and it is all over with youbut if you can only succeed in mastering them, you wil find them ever after as docile and manageable as chiren. You may turn and twist them which way yoa will; bEt beware of showing yourself weak with them for a moment, for they must be ruledwith an ironhand. The Chinese mandarins are pretty much like their own long bamboos. If one can but manage to get hold of them in the right way they are easily bent double and kept so; but if fora second you let go, they areoup again in a moment as straight as
(" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Itwas quite manifest, then, that it was impossible to measure the magnitude of the issue by the apparent smallness of the commencement; and this was not the first war ia the East which had had its orgin in small beginnings. He remembered a war which did not turn out of very long duration, but which was very glorious, as wars were called,jwbich brought great honour to those wrho conducted it and a great accession of territory to this country-he alluded to the late wrar in Barmah, which owed its origin to a loss of 900L which had been sustained by a British merchant. A noblelordiu another place, having commenteduponthe trifbing ature of the circumsance which had given rise to that war, was thus answered by the Earl of Derby in 1o53
"H He had no hesitation in entering into an examination of the representations which his noble friend the GovernorGeneral had sent home of the necessity of his first proceedings in sanctioning the course which he had felt it necessary to adopt, and in coming to the conclusion that reluctantly as he had been compelled to underake hostile operations against Ava, the amount of insult, if notthe extent of the individual injury done to British subjects, was such that, if it were felt necessary to maintain the prestige of the British character in India, and to guard ourselves from future insult and injury, they must not be allowed to pass unnoticed and unredressed. His noble friend had stated very truly that this was not the first offence which had been offered by the Burmese. It was not because a loss had been sustained by a British merchant to the extent of 9001. that we had been compeUed to demand of the Governor of Rangoon first, and of the King of Ava afterwards, a thorough indemnification and reparation for tbe insult and injury which had been inflicted upon a British subject; but it was because, from the year 1826, a succession of insults anl encroachments had gradually deprived us of al the benefits which had resulted from the lst war with Burnish, had driven our Minister from that post which he had been directed to hold, had gradually deprived us of aU the privileges to which we were entitled, and had succeeded in th arting the operations of our commerce,- because each successave insult had been tamely acquiesced in, perhaps from necessity, by the Government of the day,-it was the continued succession of those injuries and insults which had at length made it incumbent on the Governor-General not to pass them over. Without discussing the merits of this particular case he did not hesitate to say, that when the papers should be produced, they would completely bear out the assertion that, unwillingly as the Governor-General had had recourse to hostilities, it was impossible for him to have avoided them, and that, having entered upon them, it was necessary to carry them vigorously forwar "
So said Lord Derby on the Burmese war. (Cheers I He (the Lord-Advocate) did not stand there to justify 1ll the wars which we had undertaken under such circumstances, but he contended for the necessity of looking at all the facts with 'which each case was surrounded. Hon. gentlemen appeared to be quite enamoured and enchanted with Chinese compos tion. No doubt in composition they excelled, and, if they were only as trustworthy in negotiation and as true in
action as they were elegant in penmanship, our relations with them would be much more agreeable than they were; but while they were all honey upon paper they
were quite the opposite in action, for all the time Commissioner Yeh was writing plsusible deapatches to Sir J. Bowinng he was exciting his own populace against the British
in order to provide a pretence for refusing to admit our ambassador. It was impossible to judge from their writings, then, how such persons should be dealt with. (lHear, hear.) It must be remembered that the Chinese Government was at the same time arrogant and weak, and that very weakness much increased the difficulty of dealing with it. Commissioner Yeh admitted the fact,- and althongh no doubt he had exaggerated the difficulty of dealing with the people under his control, still unquestionably some difficulty did exist. As an instance of the weakness of the Government Commissioner Keying in 1844 said:-' We cannot let you into Canton just now because the people are much excited against you, but wait two years and then you will be entitlel to adson" There was no doubt, therefore, that the imperial commissioners had Fome difli. culty to contend aLainst in governing the Chinese people, but in dealing with nations of that description, nations which were not always able to fulfil their obligations, it was necessary to take advantage of favourable opportunities
for enforcing their fulflment. Some perons might think! that when the men who had beenseized on board the Arrow were sent back the matter might have been allowed to end there. (Loud cries of " Hear, hear.") That was of course a matter of opinion ("Hear, hear," and laughter); but it was to be considered whether or no the opportunity was a favourable one for enforcing the fulfilment of the Treaty of 1849. The mere return of the 12 men was no satisfaction for the insult which had been offered, and there could be no doubt that they ought to have been sent back as publicly as they were taken away. If tha had been accepted as a reparation, the Chinese would have at once said, "See these Englishmen, they are willing to put up with insult," and in all probability they would have added insults mre grave. But then came the question, was it & proper opportunity of enforcing our right of admis.

The House must recollect how important it was that the representatives of Great Britain throughout the world should have a firm hand, and allo* no insult to the flag of Great Britain. The hon. nieiber for the West Riding had spokenabont the horrors attending the bombardment of a town containing 2,000,000 inhabitants - but he could not find in the papers before the House anyt6n like the suffering descr i nor he dispo ] to accept Yeh's account of the matter as being strictly tme. On the contrary, he thought that what was done, if it were necessary that it should be done, had been done ln the most moderate manner. (LAughter and ironical cries of "H Hear, hear I") From the dense population of China-a war with that oountry must always be a horrible wx& and therefore, certainly, care ought to be taken how w* was entered into.

(Elear, h1ear.j
r. WITESIDE agreed with the hon. member for the West Riding that the question then under consideration had been debated elseahere with an eloquence which all must admire. The question of legality involved in the issue had been decided by one whose ideas were as lumninous and vhose language was as exact as if the fire of youth still inflamed his words. (Hear, hear.) It had been decided a second time by tie authority of one of the moes accurate legal writers-andone oftthe meot profound lawyers of his time, and he had hoped that no member of tho legal profession would have risen to pledge his reputation to the assertion that the course which had been adopted, and which had been sanctioned by the Government was legal, that it was justifiable, or that it was constitutionl The Lord-Advocate, however, for whom he entertained a sincere respect, had at last come to the rescue, and it was for the House to examine with perfect fairness the arguments which had been put forrard, and to ask themselves if the learned lord, with all his ability, had been able to find out anything to cover the wretched and disgraceful case which was then before the House. (Hear, hear.) He would speak as calmly as he could Khear, hear), but he must confess that he had had great difficulty in con. sidering the ease coldly, and certainly the speech of the noble member for London had excited his feelings. That speech had not been replied to by the Vice-President of the Board of Trade. (Hear, hear.) It was the speech of an English statesman (hear, hear), the speech of an English gentleman (hear, hear), every sentiment of which went home to their hearts. (Hear, hear.) And for his own part he was glad to find that in the House of Commons it was no easy matter to writedown the reputation of an eminent man (Hear, hear.) With regard to the legal question, he was anxious to hear the statement of the learned AttoreyGeneral. What was the legal question? The present Secretary for the Colonies, In introducing the meamure which was called an "Act for the Improvement of the Navigation Laws, explained the nature of a British ownership. He said:-
"I think, in exposing the British shipowner in the manner I propose to competition with all parts of the world it is but reasonable that he should be afforded every facility for obtaining his ship at the cheapestrate. I therefore propose to do away with the restriction which at present limits the right of acquiring a British register to a British-built ship. Ipro set ta ship built abroad but owned by English men snall be entitled to a British register, whether thataMp be employed in the coasting trade or in foreign commerce. IAnd wth regard to ownershbp, I do not propose anT materia alteration. There are some anomalies which I hope to remove, but with regard to the general principle of rendering British ownership necessa Ido not make any change." The right hon. member for the University of Oxford afterwards inrioduced a Iferchant Shipping Bil, and the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Labouchere) took alarm and tbought that the principle of free trade was being carried too far, and he made some very sensible observations. Re said c-
"Parliament was now called upon to enact a law by which it would hereafter be suificient for a merchant ship to have what was called a British owner, without having a single English soul on board, from the captain to the cabin boy. For ought he knew, the British vessel might never come near our shores. One might be built at Bordeaux, and navigated by Frenchmen, and trade with every country but Englan."
That was an Imperial law, and Sir John Bowring, under the authority just quoted, had about as much power lawfully to alter that law of his own motion as he had to cut off the head of the noble lord the member for the city of London (laughter); not that it would be expedientk though, for the noble lord to trust himself within the reach of Sir John if the latter were in a passion, because this would be a grievance for which there might, perhaps, be a difficulty in getting redress. (A laugh.) ~The Act of Parliament was so prudently framed that it contained a clause showing how
it was possible for a foreign local egislature to deal with this important fundamental imperial lawv. Accordingly it was provided:
The legisative authority of any British possesson shall have power, by any act or ordinance, confrmed by HerlMajesty in Council, to reIeal, wholly or in part, any provisions of this Act relating to ships registered in such possession; but no such act or ordinance shall take effect until such approval has been proclaimed in such DOSsession, or until such time thereafter as may be fixedby such act or ordinanco for the purpose.'
The blue-book which had been published he understood to be the brief put into the hands of the Government lawyer to make the best case he could for the Ministry he supported. That blue-book had been satisfactorily disposed of y the hon. member for the West Riding (Mr. Cobden)
and, looking to its contents, they were at liberty to say that there never was a ratification of any repeal of the Imperial Act by the Queen in CounciL That Imperial law thorefore stood unaltered in the smallest detree, and Sir John Bowring Lad no more right to repeal it than he had to repeal any other measure pssred by the Imperial Parliament, thoukh undoubtedly Sir John would do so in a moment if the idea once came into his head. (A laugh.) What was the first point of the learned lord ? He avoided the principal question, and said, "Let us lay aside the solemn treaty entered into between China and England; omit all considerations of international law and the legality of Sir John Bowring's acts; lay aside all recollection of those trifles, and let Us apply ourselvea to the very serious question of whether the Chinese, upon some legal point, have not waved theirright to objectnow; and whether SirJ. Bowring and his confederates had not a right to msake a murderous onslaught upon the people of Canton because they did not formally object to a certain document to which at a particular time there was no reason to object." (Hear, hear.) Now, where there existed a clear treaty between two countries, as in this case, and the English wrote a letter to the Chinese authorities which the latter did not thinkpror
to answer, he certainly had never heard it assertedthat such a communication would Ialter the original treaty. (Hear, hear. Go back to the treaty of Paris signd tho other day. What would the noble lord at the head of the Government, skilled as he was in such matters, say if the Emperor of Russia wrote to him a letter of such a nature as not, n his opiion, to deserve a answer, and if His Majesty thereupon assumed that the treaty was in some point or other completely altered ? (Hear, hear.) The LordAdvocate said there wras no occasion to refer to the treaty, because the Chinese in 1854 committed a*certainrerror in regard to twvo lorchas. The 12th section of the treaty provided as followvs: -
"1nanypositive instanco of sraugglingtransactions coming to the consul's knowledge he wll instantly apprize the Chinese authorities of the fact, and they will proceedto seize and confiscate all goods, whatever their value or nature, that may have been so smuggled, and will also be at liberty, if they see fit, to Prohibit the shio from which the
dgoods were landed from tradiig further, and to reed er aJas soon as her accoutms are adjusted and
paid." aa
And then the tresty provided that the Chinese might infict such punishment as the Government thought fit. Now, he admitted that the Chinese Government were oniy authorized to seize the goods, and that they did in the ease to which the Lord-Advocate referred seize the ships. Thereupon the British agent demanded the restoration of these two vessels; the Chinmese Government were not quiok to send them back; the British sent A small IoDp of-war and took away the vessels, and then the Chinesethatt impracticable people as they were regarded-sub. mitted to the treaty, and acknowledged that they were only entitled to seize the goods. The argu-
ment of tbe Lord-Advocate was, that becauso cncAd
occasion there was no quarrel and no dispate-uiteetW
the Chinese suffered the two vessels to be removed' ut, protest5 therefore this treaty was in some way or ~e altered by the commuznication of Sir John Bowrneg, a recunent upon which, by the way, more turned than had yet appeared to the House. At the end of this letter was a sentence of no small value in regard to the quesion at iQsue. The right hon. gentleman (=r.

Bowring, as he (the Attorney-General) believed it to be, the question was whether it was not more consistent with humanity to inflict a quick and severe punishment upon the Chinese rather than sub. mitto irsults, until atlengthyotfoundyourselvesinvolved in a war of a frightfui character, such as wAs your last war with China ? When -hon. gentlemen talked of war and humanity they talked of thmgs that were utterly inoonsistent with each other. There Was QO humanity in war. It was idle, tberefore, to speak of.testing w war by the feelings of humanity. While he said that there was no humanity in war, he of course admitted that war in modern times was carried en with far more generieous feelings and a less bloodthirsty spirit than in days gone by. But there wAs still in warsomething from which humanity shuddered, The Houso, nevertheless, ought to bear. in mind that the extent of these hostilities and the mantner in which they bad been carried on had been entirely controlled by a most excellent naval officer, whose character he (the Attorney-General) would take from the galant admiral who sat on the Ministerial side of the House, and also, he was happy to say, from one who was not absent, and a friend of his-the right hon. gentlemau the member for Carlisle. But there was a universal testimony to the humanity of the admiral who had conducted tho hostilities against the Chinese, and he thought that the regard which that gallant gentleman showed for the lives and property of the unoffending Chinese proved that these proceedings were carried on with as much humanity as any warlike proceedings could be. What, then, remained to be said ? e had already wearied the House too long. (Cheers. They had listened to his azment upon this question an his exposition of the la -f he had during that exposi tion not srken in a manner so calm and temperate as the question demanded he was unfeignedly sorry. He had endeavoured to lay before the House all the matorials with which he was acquainted upon the subject ; and he would now merely beg the House topermit him to supply an omission which he made while pointing ot to them that it was quite a mistake to suppose that there g ai never been a
nrtish ship that was not registered. The lawr upon that subiect was very correctly expressed in a passage that occurred in the treatise of Chief Justice Abbot upon ship The passad e was in page 63, and was as follows:-
"Prom the langage of te foregoing enactment it does not appear that any ship is aelutet y required to be registered, the register is noce3sarg only for conferring the pri
vileges of a British ship. The forfeiture is onlt for exerc9Mng the privileges of a British ship without havig obtained a certificate. hi nt entitled to theseprivileges may be egally owned by Britishsubjects.' subec T*here wras only one other point to which he begged to Call the attention of the House-viz., that the respect which was due to the British flagA and the British prapers which were known to be possessed by this vessel owrht, independently of anything else, to hrave entitled It to the protection due to the British flsg, without the Chinese entering into any examination of the accuracy ofrthese beconsideeis hon. friend te Lord Advocate had clearly tmguished between the ase of a ship that hu d E sond vde o,btained papers that might afterwards turn out to boe liable to some objection by reason of something not having bceen observed, asd ea ship that had fraudulently obtained papers. Thelgreatest authority on that ubject was Lard Stowell, who, in the case of the Vigiloantia reported in Bobinson, 1S, said:-
"I At isha known and established rule ith respect to a ssel that if hse is navigating under the pass of a foreign c ountry she is considered as bearing the national character of that nation uder whose pass she sails-she makes a part of its navigation, and is in every respect liable to bo consideed as a vessel of that country."
and EO again in the case of the vElizabeth (portend
Robinson, 4), lord Stowell said, "It has been decided that avessel sailing nuder the colours and pass of a nation lS to be considere as clothed weith the national cha acter." The Arrow had, defaco, the character of an English vessel, and the oblgationtupon the Chinese, according to the treaty was to deal tith her as entitled to itS immunities, and if they had a complaint to make to tprefer it through the medium of the Eng^lish ConsuL (Hear, hear.) L;et tho Hlouse observe the manner in wrhich a similar stipulation was made byr the Chinese on behalf of their own vessels, Article 14 of the supplemental treaty says:-
"aAD Englsh off icer ill be appointed at Honykong, one part of whose duty will be to examine the registers and
ssel slayihinese vessels hat may air to that epot to cuornem oods; and should suh of ficer at any tinh e G ind that any Chnese merchant vessel has not a passoer regster from one oF the five ports she is to be considered as an un authorized or smugging tessel, and not to be acl owed to trde, wghil a report of the circumstance is to be made to the Chinese authorities."
It was a niso stipulation to prevent collsion that anu interference with the flags or papers of the vessels of England or China should oe made through the medium ot he s local authority of the one or the others (. ar hear.) Ther
wrere many other circumstnces with wrhic~i at that late hour he vould not trouble the House. His object ad been to show that the law of this case required more consderation than it had yet received. Per that purpose he had syu-h mitted to the Hlouse these kgmnents, thich must he fully answTered and their error exposed before any hon. member could lay his band upon his heart and say that be wrould condemn Sir John Bourdng acdwould condemn the Government,ebecause Sir John Boourind inflamed by ambition, and led away by arrogance and ranity, had committed a most pal prable error in la, of which he was perfectly cognizant, and had, proceeding upon that error, engaged this country it war with a peaceful and unoffending peoplo. Looking at the arguments which had been delivered in another plaoe and at the contrariety of opinionss which prevailed upon this subject, no man could tale upon himself to pronounce that Judgment, and nnless he did sO he could net honestly veto for these resolutions. (Cheers.)
Several members rose to address the House, and among them Mr. B. Pmu.moux and Mrt. J. G. PH1Lu113o0B1 beth of whom moved the adjournment of the debate.
Mr. DISRAcLI.-Considering that this' is Priday, the end ot th Parliamentary wreek, and that this sbject has been very fully and ably discnued I had hoped that the House would have come to a decision to-night. (Cheers.) Of course, if Her Majestys MIinisters have any desire that the discussion should go on, it wrould not be fair, as they have treaLted the motion as oneof censure, that any obiection should be made to the adjournment of the debate. If there boe not that wish on the part of the Government, I myself should express a hope that the Hfouse willl go to adivision *,e-ulght. (Cheers and cries of " Divide, divide I")
Mr. R. PHUELIMORE expressed his willinguess to withdraw his motion for the adjournment of the debate, (Cries of "Divide, divide!"' and "Adjourn, adjourn.")
Lord PAL3iERSTON.-So far as weo are concerned, we are quite ready to go to a division to-night if the House thinks fit; but, considering that there are many other memboers who wish to express their sentiments on a matter of such very considerabie importance (hear, hear), I think it is not urmeasonable that the debate should be adjourned. (Renewred cries of " Divide" and "Akdjourn.")
The question having been put, the motion for the adjournment of the debate was agreed to; and
The House rese at 2O minutes after 12 o'clock.

Tim SEm"i OF TH NORTHX-EAST PosrS.- SnTuSF, Feb. 2a.-Yesterday evening a conference of North and South Shields shipowners and Tyne seamen was beld in the Assembly-rooms, South Shields, to discuss the question of wages and other matters appertaining to the navigation of ships. As at the previous conference, the chair was occupied by Mr. J. T. Wawn, the chairman of the Shipowners' Society. Upon the south aide of the Tyne the sbipowners have au associati6n for the employment of non-union seamen; the seamen belongiag to all the north-east ports are in union, and, as freights are low, 5s. 9d. per ton to London, employment is scarce, and the strangers brought by the owners to the port re keeping a considerable number of union raen onshore The deputation from the seamen Informed the owners that the men belonging to the north-e.st ports were agreed to take 4L 10& per voyage to London; 41. per month to the Baltic or America; and 31. 10s. per month to the Mediterranean. They refused to sail to Hamburg, Rouen, or Amsterdam for less than a voyage and a-half; but were wiling to allow a four years' apprentice to be rated as an able seaman in toe last year of his apprenticeship. I answer to the chairman they said they stil refused to sail with nonunion men, and adhered to the manning seale. Unfortumately, a good deal of scrimonious discussion arose with regard to the manning scale, The men refuse to sail in say vessel unless there be a certain groportion of ablebodied seamen and apprentices to earh 100 tons. A seaman is not competent to enter the union unless he has duly served his apprenticeship. The men challenged tho owners to say that the proportion of men per hundred tons WAs too much, and expressed their willingness to subnmit the scale to the Admiralty and abide the decision of that Board. The owners, in reply, expressedtheir determination not to be dictated to as to the manner of sailing their property The conference concludedwithout any resolutions having been agreed to; in fact, the divergence of opinion between the employer and employed was more apparent than previous to the meeting. It is not made known what course the samen will take under the ciroumstances,

LiONDON, SATURDAY, FEB)RUABY 28, 1857.
The Eonse of Lords sat only for a short time last night, and adjourned, after despatching some unimporfant business.
In the House of Commons, in reply to inquiries
by Ma. LAYAP.D,
1ord PALMEuSTON stated that he was autlhorized -to say that there was no foundation whatever for the report of a treaty having been concluded between Ruesia and Persia, and that the negotiations through the Persian ambassador at Paris were still going on.
On the motion that the House, at its rising, do radjourn until Monday, a short discussion took place npon a qu*4ion.put by Sir J. FERGUsSON as to th-s intentions of the Government respecting the ,officers of the Land Transport Corps, whose services wvere no longer required, to which an explanatory reply was given by Mr. F. PzEL.
Mlr. STAtFORiD caled attention to the necessity of taking immediate step5 for preventing the importation of diseased cattle.
The expediency of adopting prompt measures to avert fron our shores this dreadful scourge was atrodgly uraed by Lord NAAs and Mr. PACicE.
Lord P. noN maid inquiries should be made, and proper j5rbeautions taken.
The motion watagreed to.
The adjourned Wbate upon Mr. CosDres motion, tow confined tQ 'i`remoJution that the papers laid upon the tablefailedfeBtablish satisfactory grounds fortheviolmnt,meau*~rosorted to at Canton, was resumed by- - -
>. Wsa, *rfod;mlaiming all factious naotivea isglisc6ussing what ezegarded asa momentouS question, inFisted that it could not be condensedc into a dxy legal argument, The reason wsigned
for the wr into *hiclithe nicy t -be endragged with the empire of China he -rdel rd as a flimsy pretext for carrying out Vwhatappeared to'have been a long cherished design. ..'; e denied that the Chinese had gifeii j it ocaia3on for war, and he challenged the law -officeis' of the CROwN to disprove the law laid down in the House of Lords upon the question.; Commerce, -he observed, was very good; but what were the interests of commerce ' compared with national honour I Having looked iuto the matter dispassionately, he felt it to be his duty to affirm the resolution.
I The LORD ADvOoAC,r admitted that the matters involved in this discussion were most importaut, and well deserved the consideration of the House, for they included individual justice towards those intrusted wvith great authority and who were obliged to act upon a great emergepcy, and the risk of inflicting irreparable snjury upon the national interests by what might be said in Parliament. There were two questions he observed,-flrst, whether the proceedings of Sir JoHN BOWRpNG and his coadjutors were according to international law; and, secondly, supposing they were legally right, whether their ulterior proceedings were Justifiable under the circumstances. On the first question he undertook to say, and he argaed upon the facts, that there was no ground for asserting that the international law had been transgressed by our authorities abroad. He contendled that the Hongkong Ordinance of 1855 was a valid law as respected the Chinese, and that whether or not it was contrary to our municipal law had nothing to do with the question. The boarding of the lorcha was, no doubt, a preconcerted aot, not a mistake, and he thought there'were plain indicatiobs that the nationality of the vessel was known. The real question lay here,-was that a proceeding in good faith or not ? The act was considered by Sir JoHN BowNrrNG as an outrage and an insult, which consisted in the animus, and if it wasregarded as an intentional and deliberate insult, he wanted to know what Sir JOBN BowViNG was to have done. The French and the American authorities in China approved his proceeding, and scarcely any practical man who had been to that country said that he had acted wrong, for they knew the danger of overlooking the slightest intentional affront by such a Government as that of China. If this be a question of justice and morality, he said, that was another matter; but if it be a mere question of policy he warned, the House to pause before it put between us and China a barrier which might be far more dangerous than any yet offered.
Mr. WSIrraE asked the House to examine the arguments put forward by the LoRD ADvocATr, and say whether, with all his ability, he had made out anything like a case on behalf of the Government. lie maintained, in opposition to the Loan AnvocAsa, that the Hongkong Ordinance, not having been ratifled at home, had no validity, and he controverted other positions of the learned lord upon the legal points in the question, investigating as he proceeded the perplexed history of the lorcha with an amusing minuteness. After inveighing against what he alleged to be duplicity, misstatements of law, and misrepresentations of facts on the part of the British officials, he disputed the conclusions of the LoRD ADvoCABT as to the animus of the Chinese; and to his warning against overlooking smal affronts he opposed another warning, not to be guilty of smal infractions of international law, or trample on the weak and submit to the strong. The language of Sir JOHN BOWRIuG and Mr. PcaumEs, he affirmed, had been arrogant, insolent, overbearing, and domineering.
Mr. HoRsFa.L said it appeared to him that the whole guestion, as related to the Arrow, resolved itself into two points,-was she bond fide a British vessel or not? and did the Chinese believe her to be a British vessel at the timne they committed the outrage ? He contended that the name and the flag sufficiently characterized the nationality of the vessel, and he believed that the insult was complete and intended. Having noticed a few of the argaments used byLord J. RusszLr, he repelled with some degree of warmth the charge of " selfish violence" which Mr. CoBDEN had preferred against the merI chants of Liverpool. He felt it to be his duty, he
said, to vote against the motion, because he should otherwise be guiltyof an act of greatinjustice j because it would amount, in effect, to a vote of censure upon Sir J. BOWnaING and Admiral SEvsroum,-a most humane and gallant man,-as well as upon Lord CLRnxON and. RHa MAJESTYS Government ; and, although he differed from them upon many ques. tions, he did not see anything to justify a vote of censure. Above all, he looked to the consequences which the adoption of the resolution might entail upon British property, British interests, and British life in China.
Lord R. CrOm supported the motion. He denied that there had been any legitimate cause of complaint against the Chinese Government, and he insisted that if there was such ground in the mode of seeking redress we had violated international law.
Sir C. NArP was satisfied that SirM. Saymoua must have been convinced that the ATrow was a British vessel, and he considered that the demand for reparation was a reasonable one; that demand had been refused, and Sir M. SEymoun must have adopted the course he took, or have pocketed the affront, and borne the imputation of a want of courage and resolution.
Lord GODLxICE, in supporting the motion, severely censured the conduct of Sir JomN BowRING, and asked whether the House was prepared to lay down the doctrine that the doings of our agents abroad, although they abused the prerogative of the CRowN, must be approved. The effect of this motion, he hoped, would be to make the Government very careful whom they select for those agents.
Mr. 3EzNTyrCX Was prepared to admitthat,mak:iz every dne allowance for the difficulties of alo i
Governor, there was quite enough on the papers to, justify the terms of the resolution; but he had to consider, he said, the consequences of his vote, and he believed that, without reference to the motion, or the demerits of the Government, from all he could learn, if the resolution was adopted, the announcement in China would so complicate affairs that it would aggravate the p resent state of things tenfold. He was not, therefore, prepared to support the motion.
Sir M. BERRaEY, in a few words, defended Sir MIOHA} SExarBou.
Sir J. GR.nAUr also paid a tribute to the character of Sir M. SEsmoun, observing that aU his presumptions would be in favour of the course he had pursued; but Sir MrcnAar. had been subject to the discretion of the civil chief, Sir JOMi BowRMG, upon whom he (Sir JAmas) thought it would be unjust to bear hardly, acknowledging, however, that he thought him more remarkable for self-confidence than for soundness of judgment. But the Government had identified themselves with all he had done; and if he had erred it was not clear that he did not believe he wasgiving effect to the wishes of HaFR MAmSTry's Government. As to the lawregarding the affair of the lorcha, the quzestion, he thought, lay in a narrow compass, both as to ownership and as to the colonial Act, the provisions of Imperial Acts had been set aside, and, in his opinion, the license grauted to the Arrow was invalid ab initio. If so, she was not-a British vessel; the Chinese authorities had therefore a perfect right to board her, and there was conclusive evidence that Sir J. BowurNa was perfiectly aware that, owing to the expiration of the license, the lorcha was not entitled to British protection. Yet
ne nad in another part of the correspondence 'maintained the contrary, thereby knowinglypractisinog a deception upon the'Chinese Goverinnent, uponwhi?h he founded a demand for reparation. And not only had Sir JOHN Bow.Viw. not been censured for a falsehood which in an attorney would have been punished by his being struck off the rolls, but his acts had been approved by the Government. Then, as to the question of policy, the affair of the lorcha was evidently bat a pretext; from the time of his arrival at Hongkong Sir JoHNw Bowaaum had fretted under the peremptory prohibition issued by usuccessive home Governmaents against commencin hostilities with the Chinese; but his (Sir JEAs'i
belief was tha, Sir Jouw BoVwavaG thought the opportunity had arrived, in consequence of the affairs of the lorcha, to push the question of force. Mr. LABoucVCl had, indeed, recognized a new motive for hostilities,-the emancipation of the I eople of Canton from the cruel government of Commissioner YzH. [Mr. LABoucHnEa here gave a different interpretation of 'what he had said.) Sir JAalis then dwelt upon the effect of the military and naval operations upon the Cantonese, and he asked the HIouse whether they were prepared to adopl- the approbation of tl"sse
iransactions which hadc been expressed by ]1a; MAJSTY'S Government. He thought it was high time to arrest such proceedings. The re-
solution he considerod- to- be- temperate, moamlsxed.
at UfOerat min its terns, and tlhem;tbros wotiy of support, ilbut it his choice lay betwewt1Ib'resoluti6n and the beig party t6 theme troti6os he eoiTd not doubt what was his duty. lROewdi9d wash -his hands of the innocenit blood which hitehe*ed had been shed; and he never gave a ,te with a inore cobscientious conviction of its propriet than the voto he ahould give in fasvour of the motion.
The A.To6min-GxwsAui began by ialyzing the arguments -employed upon this question in the House of Lords, which were reduciblb, he said, to thesethreepropositions:-First, that the colonl ordinance, on which the registry of the lorcha depended, was at variance with an Imperil ctatute, and.therefore utterly void, econd that, supposng the colonial ordinance valid, the register granted to the Arrow was defective and had expired ; third, that, even if the ordinancewere valid and the register good and subsisting, it did not qualify Chinese to possess the vessel, or exempt it from the authority of the Emperor of CxN.i. All that had beenheard in this and the other House, he observed, fell under these three heads, and he proceeded to discuss the several propositions. In an exposition of the lW he maintained that the title of the Arrow to be considered a British vessel did not rest upon the colonial ordinance. but upon the treaty with. the Chinese, and that'it was an error to suppose that the colonial ordinance was a violation of the imperial statute, which was inapplicable. Two things, therefore, he contended, 'were clear,-that it was wrong to suppose that the colonial register was inconsistent with the Imperial statute; and that, assuming the register to have expired or to have
irregular, it was not competent to the Chinese to take advantage of those defects. The ATxonsrGm~na~n then -addressed himself to the argurment of Lord LY.D1 sTr on the question of international law, contending that the true point was whether a natural-born subject of China becoming a resident at the British colony of Hongkong, and therefore a British subject, might not by virtue of the treaty owna ship and receive a register which would entitle it to aU the privileges of a British ship, and he argued upon authority in affirmance of the proposition. All the three objections, he contended, were devoid of foundation, and it was hard he said, to stigmatize poor Sir JoHm BowniNo, an
hold him up to ridicule, as guilty of error in a question respecting which Lord LmonutsT was at variance with Lord WmS=YiDALz, and Lord ST. LEONAID'S and the Lorn CH ;Oaioro were in direct opposition. From all he had seen he had observed a strong desire in Sir JoHN Bow. RING to support the just rights of the Chinese. But in the matter of the lorcha he had believed the Cbinese were actuated by a spirit of wanton insult, and he (Sir R. BamnuE) thought he had arrived at a correct conclusion.
The debate was again adjoured.
Some further business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 25 minutes past 12 o'clock, until Monday.
Could we imagine the Emperor of CHINA, or that
Could we imagine the Emperor of Cna&, or that amiable " gentleman" Commissioner YzH, present at the debates of our Parliament, he would pro.- bably conceive the greatest hopes of a signal triumph over the Outer Barbarian. As speaker after speaker rose up to describe His Celestial Majesty as the patriarchal ruler of a free people, the populace of Canton as a flock of sheep, and YEH their guileless pastor,-as they represented the affair of the Arrow as an unfortunate mistake, done in utter simplicity, an offence neither in law nor intention, yet freely, speedily, and amply amended,-as they further described the Chinese as persecuted, beset, Waylaid, ensnared, and outraged by the " foreign devi' at their door,the Celestial stranger would be delighted to hear that his unexpected sympathizers were not ordinary men, but the greatest of the land. He would hear that, without a fee, his cause had been energetically pleaded by two ex-Chancellors, besides expectant Chancellors, by en-Premiers and expectant Premiers, by leaders of the Lords and of the Commons, by a Bishop who, if not an " en,". was some other unknown and unappreciated quantity, by an ex-Governor-General of India, wrhom he could not but remember with terror, by writers, novelists, and a crowd of celebrities. On hearing these overpowering testimonies to the simplicity of his motives and the intrinsic justice of his cause, the silken savage would begin to flatter himself, not only that be was not the impostor, the charlatan, the tyrant that his own conscience had formerly suggested, but that he might live to see the barbarian dogs compelled to lower their flag and do him that homage Bo dear to Eastern vanity in the eyes of his people. But, amiable Yur, disciple of Coxrucus, teacher of virtue, interpreter of law, slaughterer of myriads, it is time to dispel the growing illusion. You are not the only impostor in the world, or even the greatest. The zeal which inspires all these powerful personages is an ambition, not to relieve you from the terrible consequences of your insolence and folly-not to avert the just vengeance gathering over your head -but to have the pleasure and honour of accomplishing it. They are struggling, not to release you from the triangles, but to have a turn at the cat-o'-nine tails, which they think they can wield more dexterously and efficaciously than the present exe%lutionerS. If PAn.Es, BowvRMG, SEYMOUr, PAIrsroN, LABOUCHERE, and their colleagues have beaten you with rods, DERBY, ELTEUnTOROUTGH, RUSSELL, and GRAAM humbly hope they may live to give you a taste of scorpions. Your present persecutors bear in mind the beginning of the quarrel, and have therefore some measure for your punishment. Their successors would take up the task without any such embarrassing limits. Free as air, they will own no rule but possibilities and the ever-expanding future; and if your present generous advocates should leave you-we will not say your rifled palace, or your half-slaughtered people, but the head on Your shoulders, it is more than we expect, and quite as much Ms a similar met of British sympathizers-nay, these very men -did for your predecessor, Commissioner LmN, fifteen years ago.
But when our supposed visitor from the Celestial Empire had discovered the real character of all this subtle, ingenious, and brilliant advocacy, he would perceive with his usual quickness that after all there was no such difference between an English politician and a Chinese. He would reflect that these gentlemen were doing very much what he had been doing in his own sphere, and what he would certainly do in theirs. It is worth while to compare the British and the Oriental type,-the former in Parliament, the latter penning letters or instructing his myrmidons at Canton. Commissioner YmH is a master of* duplicity. Pursuing a system of the utmost dishonesty and cruelty to the foreigners who came to him for the fair and open purposes of a beneficial trade, he could assume the character of an honest functiouary, an indignant moralist, and an injured victim. He could act at discretion the wolf or the lamb. He could send his Mandarins with a body of armeed men to board a ship the build, flag, ownership, and known employment of 'which prodlauied it substantially British, and commit an outrage upon it which he well knew his own people would construe into the moa'c signal indignity put upon the foreigners. Or; the other band, he could put off the wolf, with the celerity described by M. H'u, and, puttiDng O the lamb, bleat, letter after letter, with prffessions of innocence and simplicity. To,ftne foreigner he could declare from his heart that he had no idea it was a British vessel, and Could not conceive how ak tag couldi make it one, or how. it con) d be ohe, when there Was. io British-capthiiii on board. He - iould appeal to ;ur relig7t9Ii
wl.1ich to his own people evrery Chinew official habitually traduces, and to our morality, wkc xiA
*a ssmiorxnlgdenies. Ie could make Javish offers of amenda -which he kne, hod n6 iuch force mi the eyei of his own people. Hle could' expatiate on the calamitieswhich one word of truth and justice on his part could avert, and wthich his own atrocious policy at Canton shows him incapable. oE. feeling very deeply. He could split hairs about the nationality of the Arro* at the very time rhen he Well knew the broad and popular nature of the dispute. No one the least acquainted with the Chinese mind fails to recognize the duplicity of the man in every stag. of the affair. As little can he fail to recognize the same element in the British advocacy, unbought, but not wholly disinterested, of the Commissioner's cause. We say it advisedly, -and we saz it with the candid admission that, since China has forced us into this quarrel, we could have wished the immediate cause of rupture had been more unmistakeable,-we never remember the great names of law, morality, and religion so much jobbed and profaned as in this affair, with the single exception of the former Chinese war. On that rf emorable occasion several of the very same parties played the same farce of outraged humanity, made the same speeches, mutktits autandis, they have cone this week, got into power, and prosecuted the war with redoubled energy, and extorted not only the Treaty they now tell us is too rigorous for compliance, but also enormous damages for what . they -had declared to be no wrong. After this it will not be denied that, though our more civilized ways prevent us from producing such an unmitigated ruffian as we believe YEiE to be, ho will find his match for .dplicityjnot in Sir Jomq BowRINO, but in his own particular advocates and friends in the British Legislature.
This abuse of legal subtlety is all the less excusable, inasmuch as law always comes round in the end to the dictates of plain common sense. Let any reader of ordinary intelligence first consider what are the only possible conditions on which we can hold such a colony as Hongkong, and carry on an immense trade with such a port as Canton, and such a people as the Chinese, and then peruse the very able and interesting speeches of the LoRD-ADvocAT and the AxToRy-GEN-uAL. He will see that our case is founded on the plainest necessity, which, between nations, is the foundation of right. At Hongkong we have a large population of Chinese, who, if not British subjects entirely, are necessarily residing on British soil, bound to British interests, and therefore under British protection against YEn, all his Mandarins, and sll their British advocates in the world. This is a matter of . course, and the Americans, who even at Smyrna rescued from Austrian clutches a Hungarian who had resided but a few months in the States, without being completely naturalized, could not demur for a moment to the doctrine that these Chinese were under our protection, and that we were bound to protect them. The formalities under which men in this condition might give a British character to a ship in the waters of China are matter for our own consideration-that is, for the discretion of the authorities of Hongkong. Bat with these formalities, with our Acts of Parliament, or with the colonial ordinances, the Chinese Government has nothing to do, and it is only from abundance of caution and favour that we need give them information on these points. Common sense, and that law of nations which carries out common sense, plainly give a foreign character to vessels of foreign build, engaged in a foreign trade, carrying a foreign flag, and known to be manned and owned by persons domiciled, engaged, and holding land in a foreign island, u Hongkong is now vwith regard to China. If such a vessel were a pretender, that would be a matter for formal remonstrairce; but the deliberate outrage on the Arrow was-evidently planned and defended, not as against that particular lorcha, but against all the lorchas, and the whole system of vessels so manned and so employed. The term of the register, the expiry of the register, and such minute points have only been imported into the dispute, which really and substantially is this, -whether, in prosecution of a systematic and partially successful design to annill the Treaty of 1842, the Chinese authorities may refuse to recognize tle British character of vessels ostensibly British, and substantially so, inasmuch as they belong to our trade, to persons under our protection, and amenable to our regulations. We do really hope and trust, for the honour of our country, that such members of the House of Commons as can afford to be independent will not be diverted from the common sense of the question, which we have not the least doubt is also the la* of it.
In some figures which we recently published on
In some figures which we recently published on the authority of the Board of Trade might have been discerned two or three facts of a very striking and very instructive character. The accounts in question exhibited the snums received from the Custoums Duties during the past year, amounting in the whole to 24,206,8441., whereas the corresponding totals for 1855 and 1854 were but 22,615,7081. and 22,357,3881. respectively. It is not, however, the mere 'circumstance of the increase which now attracts our notice or to which we invite the attention of the reader. Most persons are, no doubt, aware that the Customs' Duties are levied on a great varietyof articles, and it is generally understood, we dare say, that the proportions in which these articles contribute severally to the means of the country are extremely unequal. .But we doubt whether many readers wiU be prepared for such results as -we cau now put before them with reference to this feature of finance. The article yielding the greatest amount of' revenue is sugar, after which comes tea, aud then tobacco. Each of these contributes (our figures throughout are those of 1856) upwards of five millions of money. Spirits and wine follow, the former with two milions and a-half of produce, the latter with more than a million. These five articles may be taken as forming a first class. A second may be constituted out of three other articles-viz., timber, grain (including flour), anA coffee, each of which is worth, upon an average, upwards of half a million to the Exchequer, the first and third being over, the second somewhat under, the mark. We may then compose a third class out of fruits, silks, butter (with cheese), and spices, the aggregate produce of which is not much short of a million-fruits being the mo,st prolific of the group. And now comes the extraordinary conclusioni; for it is literally true that at this point we might make a full stop, and exempt frQm duty all the whole catalogue of ether taxed articles without rery materially affecting the revenue. True, tallow yields the eomparatively rspectable sum of 68,4571., and the entire aggregate of other articles, when their contributions are an added together, does figure for more than half a million-for nearly as much, that is, as timber or coffee alone; but the accalracy of our deduction will be sufficiently appareRt if we state in simple terms that the total prodace of the twelve articles comprised in the three dlasses above meationed was not less than 23,593,4471. out of the gross revenue of. 24,206,8441. received for the Customs of the year. In point of fact, if these twelve articles, snd these only'A, had been liable to duty during L856, the Customs' revenue of that year would Ftillhave.ihoa decided hiinceass over the, yeat Erecedng-a greater< one, indeed, than that year
xh-idover 1854. 'Wha;t a chance for iimphificatiod d1eo such results supply I
A great authority ws quoted in u recent deb&tQ
to prove. tha. niiplicity in tIxatfiO 'Was by no Sneams necessarily equivalent tolightnef. oerquality -a proposition which, with due qualifiaton we might safely admit. It might be fairly doVt.d, for example, whether the great scheme of some of our financial reformers for levying the whole income of the State by direct taxation would lie as lightly as they think; but the principle here referred to is one of a very different kind from that which we are now considering. It -may be desirable to raise oxly a certain proportion. of the revenue by Customs, and a certain proportion by 'Excise; in the Customs' Duties themselves it may be expedient so to distrbute the taxation that an article like tea or sugar should be rateda only proportionately to an article like wine or spirits, but these maxims caniot affect the propriety or impropriety of taxino a nnimblr nf
articles with scarcely any return at all. WVe have already said that half a million or so is all that-is contributed to the Exchequer bythe entire remain.der of articles subject to the Customs' Dtties 'after the 13 principal contributories have been taken into the account. We may now add that no fewer than 139 kinds of goods are taxed without producing in any one case so inue)i as 10,000., and in this list are comprised as many as 31 which actually yield less thaan 201. each per annum. In the year 1855 certain comnmodities yielded only a small part even of the very moderate: produce last-mentioned-viz., 11. each, and, indeed, when we peruse the recondite titles of "essence of spruce," " manna croup," and "per"fumed powder," we are at some loss to understand how they could have been productive at all.
But in this case, it may be said, what is the harm of taxing them ? Who is injured by the duty, whatever it may be, upon "manna croup," and why should not this precious substance pay its pound to the Exchequer? The answer is very obvious. The advantage here to be considered is not that of the consumer nor that of the Treasury, which may be respectively nit, but that of the revenue system and its general operation upon commercial intercourse and public convenience. We can perfectly understand the doctrine under which the Customs' Duties would be levied upon fifty articles rather than five if the actual course of consumption admnitted of the distribution; but if the odd forty-five are found in practice to return only an inappreciable proportion of the sum required and furnished from this source of revenue, it is clear that the distribution is only imaginary, and that the five productive commodities might pretty nearly as well be taxed by themselves. The duties upon tea and timber, for instance, are in no degree lightened by those upon perfumed powder and essence of spruce. But, while the revenue thus gains nothing by the multiplication of taxable articles not inviting consumption, it loses by the complication of system and procedure which this variety introduces, while many annoyances, small in themselves but irritating to the national tUmperament, are likely to arise from the practice. Look, for example, at the commodities which a homeward-bound Englishman is likely to import under his personal charge into Folkestone or Boulogne. Possibly he may trespass in the way of tobacco, which is plainly inadmissible, but it is far more probable that his collection will be constituted of harmless curiosities and foreign odds and ends, deriving all their attraction from being do unlike anything English. What can be the use of bringing such items under the ken and gripe of the Custom-house, to the additional trouble of its officers and the vexation of Messrs. BBowN, JoNas, and RoBiNsoN, without any benefit to the Exchequer?
Perhaps we may be told that the amount of duty actually received upon an article affords no mneasure of the importation which might ensue if the tax were removed. It may be a prohibitive duty-intended to be so-and answering its purpose. If such a case can be established, well and good; the question is then not one of revenue, but of protection; but in how many instances in the list under review would this principle be applicable? Why should we not be deluged with " manna ' croup," even supposing such a result to follow the exemption of this mysterious article from duty? We presume it is not a dangerous " vermin-killer," or an aggressive water-weed like that now choking up our rivers, or even a disease, although its last syllable sounds ominously in that respect. " Per"fumed powder" looks rather like a luxury, but, though luxuries should be taxed, they need not be prohibited. An article of this kind either would or would not be imported in larger quantities if the duty were removed; but, inasmuch as people will not, at any rate, pay the duty to get it, the Exchequer would be as well off in either event, while the revenue system would be simplified by the abolition of a tax.
It used to be said that one great argument against the extension of direct taxation to small incomes was to be found in the fact that beyond a certain point the plague was greater than the profit-the cost of collection than the sum collected. We may certainly apply the same principle to Customs' Duties, though the line may not be so easily traceable. How many officers or how much of their time may be employed for the sake of the odd half-million which makes our Customs somothing over 24,000,0001., instead of being something under it, we cannot pretend to say; and it will perhaps be remarked that, while a detective is rummaging a portmanteau for contraband cigars, he may just as well keep his eye open for " essence of spruce." It is quite clear, however, that thero must be a point at which the imposition and collection of a duty on articles of importation result in a loss, aud equally so, we think, that this point must have been reached in a good many of the articlos which return so comparatively small a sum between them.
Mr. ERNEST JONES is again busy with his great
Mr. EaIN-sT JoNns is again busy with his great assertion that in the United Kingdom there are some 30,000,000 acres, or thereabouts, of uncultivated land. It is a pity he did not present his readers at the same time with a calculation of the number of acres not under plough or grass in the moon. They are as likely to receive benefit from the one quarter as from the other. There are, no doubt, labourers and artisans in abundance in this country who are out of employment, and acres in abundance which have never been brought under cultivation. The question is how to bring them together. Mr. ERNEST Johis remarks with ragar& to Emigration to the United States :-" Snd tha "British emigrant landless and moneylm to the "United States, and what will be his fate ? rou "cannot let him alight in the Far 'West from a "baUoon, and, if he did, whlence shag- he get the "stock, the seed, the materials for, ecmmenoing"what shaU he live on until his hzm is ready, his "hut built,his seed sown, and hislarvestg athered?" These are all very proper 4aestion%, but they apply with equal force to the, location of destitute persons on the unnultivatka lands of the British Islands. We all know wllat would happen. Either the public must furnish, These home-colonists with the necessary funds '.o bring the land under cultivation, or they w-jild fall back on the Unions.

That there will be &rih andapoor everywhere we freely adrmit. We l,' no panacea which will eliminate poverty from the catalogue of human ills; all that we can pretend to accomplish is to take persons who suffer fromn great destitution in this country, and to place thenA where they can get work in plenty and good wages,
The other day Mr. WmiAx Howrrr addressed a very excellent letter to this journal, which duly appeared in our columns, on the subject of Emigration to Australia. This gentleman deprecates either private subscriptions or Government aid from ordinary public.sources for the purpose. His statement is, that the Governnent already has funds on hand for the purpose from a special source. The proceeds of the land sales in Austrais: are appropriated, he tells us, or professedly appropriated, to the conveyance to the AustraliEa
colonies of the necessary labour. He makes great complaints of the modus operandi of the lEmigration-office at Westminster as of a di'tinguished branch of the Circumlocution Depart: ment. The people of Victoria seem to take the same view of the question. The following passage is to be found in the address of the prO tempre: Governor of Victoria to the new Parliament on its opening:-" He should propose the discontinuance " of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commis" sion, and the establishment of a distinct " agency for Victoria in'the ljnited Kingdom." Now, how does this matter really stand? Are there returns in existence which will give us the necessary information'? If not, will somer enterprising member distinguish himself by obtaining a return-it might be comprised on a single half-sheet-which would put us in possession of the following particulars of information :-What.iE the precise sum now standing to the credit of the, Government under the head of "Australian TAn* " Sales," distinguishing the sums contributed each year for the last four or five years from this, source? What is the number of emigrants annuually despatched for the last four or five years by the Emigration-office on account of the colonies ' What has been the cost per head of the despatcht: of each emigrant? Finally, what are the regulations or restrictions imposed by the Emigration-' office on applicants for a pamage to the Australiax. colonies? Our attention has been very forcibly called. to this subject by the announcement that some thousands of workmen are to be instantly discharged from our dockyards and arsenals, the last of thenito be cleared out by April 5. Considering the pritzent condition of the labour-market in England, and. the distress which exists among our artisans, it may well be imagined what fresh derangement will be caused by this huge addition of skilled labourto the already overcrowded stock. Nowr, the class of labourers which is just about to be dismiiredi from the arsenals and dockyards is precisely the; one 'which is most needed at Melbourne at ther present moment. We subjoin the rates of wages in that colony under the date given, and, as it isto be presumed that a considerable proportion ofthose artisans may have wives and grown-up daughters, we include the rates of wages for female labour:-
1 By the Overland Mail of the 11th of October we learn that the demand for female labour, both for town an& country, is increasing. Rough aboar of aU kinds is meeting with ready employment. There is a better demand for skilled labour, especially among tho building trades; and in.. confirmtion the following rates of wages are given : Married ooplee without families, from 75? to 851. per annum, with rations; married couples with families, frox 655. to 651.; gardeners, 501. to o51. * grooms, 401. to 50Z. ;- stockmen, 601. to 701.; shepherds, 35. to 401.; men cools, 701. to 901.; female cooks, 301. to 456.: thorou2h femal.
servats, ZW. to 35M; nursemaids, 201, to 25g. ; heusemsids,
251.; hnndxesses, 30A to 35g.; and all these with their Ireep, of course; carpenters, 14s. to 15s. per aay; masons, 18s.; plasterers, 14s. to 15s.; bricldayers, 14s. to 16s.; blacksmiths, 12s. to 14s.; quarrymen, lOs.; labourers on the road, Ss. to lOs. per day, wood, water, and tents found."
This being to, is it too much to as1k that thea Government should offer a free passage at the e.xpense of the Australian Land Fund to as many of these discharged artisans as may choose to accept it ? But if there is any difficulty withx regard to this Fund emigrants can be conveyed by ahip from Liverpool, and by rail to. Toronto, ixt Upper Canada, at the expense of 6F. Iper head. There is, however, no reason why the
country should be directly debited with any fresh charge on account of the sea passage. It is scarceoy am exaggeration to say that there are scores of Quzyix& ships lying idle which might be employed to convey emigrants to Quebec with scarcely any additional charge upon the public funds. The skilled arisans, of whom we are more particularly speaking, would be invaluable as settlers in Upper Ctunada. They are the very persons of whom every new colony Stands in need.

PARIS, TaunsDAY, ExB. 26, 6 P.Y.
Those who declared ia positive terms a few days
ago the definitive settlement of the Persian question* were exceedingly premature. The Russian organ, theNord, of Brussel, whose habit of sweeping assertion has acquired for it & certain notoriety not tending to increase its credit announced the same fact as undoubted, and, as is al30 its wont, greatly modified its assertion subsequently. Even now, whatever the patient perseverance with which the negotiations are followed up, or however promising the prospect, it would be unsafe to affirm that the question is finally settled. Under all the circumstances of the case, no one would be justified in saying so until the signatures of the British Minister for Foreign Alairs and the Persian Envoy are affixed to the Peace Treaty, and even then we have no certainty that the affair is concluded. Our Government may accept and sign the treaty, but it must be remembered that it has to be ratified at Teheran; and this ratification depends on whether Rus3ian influence is, or is not, all-powerful at the Court of the Shah. lf Russia can dictate, and if the Persian Government submit to her dictation at the moment the news of our treaty is received there, or if she be more powerful than France, the chances against the ratification are increased, and it would be exposed to the risk- of being rejected altogether. When gentlemen exhibit impatience in Parliament about the progress of these negotiations, it would be as well to bear in mind the endless delays and numerous difficultiea which are almost invariably encountered in negotiations with Orientals. Such people can hardly ever be brought to a point. They are fluent, mellifluous, andcomplimentary in speech; talk much, are pleutiful in sounding phrases, and are abundant in promise; but when you fancy the moment is come for buainess, and that every difficulty, every misunderstanding has disappeared, you are mortified to find that YOu are as far off as ever from the conclusion. the hopes based on the promise of one day are seattered on the next, and you have to begin the weary work again. Then the repugnance these people have to put down anything on paper. None seem more impressed with the maxim verba volant, scnpta inanent, and they prefer words, which are but wind, to the black characters which stare them in the face, and which cannot be denied or explained away. If the negotiator were any one else but a Persian it is probable tbat not one, but half a dozen, peace treaties might have been negotiated, signed, and ratified since the first interview with Lord Stratford.
If Feruk Khan, dilatory, procrastinating, and Acute as he may be, had only to do with the Eaglish Ambassador, the chances of an arrangement would have been much greater. I should not be surprised if the good resolutions of one day were weakened the next, and that even here Russia uses her influence to undo what may be done. The counsels that come from St. Petersburg are not to our advantage, and perhaps Feruk Khan has occasionally listened to them with too much attention. The summary of the conferences with the English Ambassador has, I doubt not, been regularly despatched to London, and the last, which was more conclusive-if the term " conclusive " can be safely applied to it-promises, as I have said, very favourably. The draught may have by this met with the approval of our Government, and, for aught I know, the treaty may be signed in Downinstreet; but the important point is the ratificatio'n at Teheran, and of this no man can be oertain.
It is but an act of justice to state that throughout the whole of this affair the Emperor Napoleon has acted in a straightforward, disinterested, and honourable manner, and, so far as can be judged by his words and acts, his earnest desire has been to remove every obstacle, and to facilitate a satisfactory solution of the question. It is useless now to refer to the past, or to discuss the original cause of our quarrel; but I cannot help believing that if the French diplomatic agent had then made common cause with our Minister, and had announced his resolution to quit Teheran when Mr. Murray suspended diplomatic relations with the Shah, the rmatter would have ended then.
I learn that the Russian Ambassador in Paris, as wel as the Persiau Envoy, deny the existence of the treaty between Russia and Persia, said to have been ratified at Teheran on the 18th of January, and the Nord gives a similar contradiction. I need hardly say that the non-existence of that treaty requires some authority less interested in keeping it secret than either of the parties just mentioned. The existence of the treaty is nevertheless affirmed in other quarters, and it is even whispered that for the cession of the portion of territory in question, including Mount rarat, by which 3Russia would command the pass of Bayazid, and which had been long coveted by Russia, the latter has engaged to give Persia the assistance of a corps d'armte and a permanent garrison of 5,000 men at Herat, in case the war with England continued.
It has been stated in the papers that a day has been fixed for the Conference on the Neuchatel question. This I deny. Weeks ago it was said that the beginning of March would be the time, but that statement was made on the supposition that a Russian Plenipotentiary would be named before then. This has not been the case. Russia has not named any Plenipotentiary, and I am not sure that she has given her formal consent to the Conferences.
Mirza Riza and Mirza Mussin, two young Persians attached to Peruk Khan's suite, and who were admitted as physicians at Teheran, have been ermitted to attend the lecture3 in the School of M3edicine of Paris. This favour is the more valuable to them as the practice of dissection is forbidden in Persia.
A letter from Milan of the 22d inst. states that the ,official publication of the appointment of the Archduke Maximilian to the government of the Lombardo-Venetian provinces was expected that day, and orders had been given by the municipal authorities for illuminations in consequence, but the day had passed over without anything new. It is added however, that the Imperial ordinance appointing the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian GovernorGeneral is signed by the Emperor. The difficulties which prevent the publication of the decree are of a double nature. In the first place, the Archduke 'wishes to bring round him Italians who are popular with their countrymen. His Highness wishes to have the advice of such councillors as Signors Gori, Decio, Valmarina, Guicciardi, &c., but the Emperor's advisers reject such men, for one reason or another. In the second place, the Archduke does not wish General Gyulai as his military Adlatus, as he would reside in Milan, and would be too powerful for him, having under his command five corps d'arm6e, from the Tyrol to Ancona, from tlle Isonzo to the Ticino. The Archduke does not wish such a power so near him. Hle wishes, it is said, that General Gyulai should be sent to Verona, and that Count Stadion should be his military Adlatus at Milan. The Archduke believes that by removing Count Gyulai from the capital of tlombardy he would be rid of a considerable diffculty, for the General has been the real personification of the system which has been in force since 1852, and which has so much contributed to increase the natural unpopularity of the Austrians irl Italy. In this point of view public opinion says the Archduke is not wrong. Neither is General Gyulai wrng when nsstlng on the military preponderance, fn eiettatteol iorb hc
tOr It is evident that the only mode b hc
Austria can govern Italy is by'force, and nothing but force. Baron Burger had been occupied with Baron Bach the greater part of the night of the 21st. Baron Bruck had left Milan, and Baron Bach was expected soon to follow him. Count Buol had previously left for YVienna. Reports of various kinds were current as to the de-
parture of the Court. Some say that the Emperor
-irll soos leaye-that the Empress will accomnpany the Emperor to Mantua, and thence return to pass the remainder of the winter at Milan. Others say that the Court will remain at
Milan until the month of May. Others, again,
pretend that their Imperial Majesties wil
remain at Milan to receive the young wife of the Archduke Maximilian, the Princess Charlotte daughter of the King of the Belgians. Baron de Bach said the day previous, in speaking to Count Archinti, that it was not a ConEstitution that
the Emperor would give the Lombards, but some
thing that would surpass all their expectations. It is believed that the King of the Belgians would not

VENNA, FmE 24.
The changes which have just been made in the' passport system have given universal satisfaction, aud each of the leading orgaus of the Viemna press has an article in praise of a measure so conformable to the spirit of the age. For two whole years the Ministers in vain endeavoured to persuade the police to agree to a reform of the passport system, and the probability is that things would now be exactly where they were in 1855 if the Emperor had not intervened. For the information of foreigners travelling to and in Austria an epitome of the new passport regulations will now be given. 1. As a rule, every person travelling to Austria with a non-Austrian passport must obtain the vua of some Austrian Minister or Consulresidingabroad, but the frontier authorities havethepowertopermitatravellertoenterthecountry for a fortnight even if his passport has mot the visa in question. That every traveller will do welitotake care that his passport is in perfect order need hardly be said. 2. After the 15th of March the passports of travellers in Austria will only be visd on their arrival at the frontiers. 3. As the passport will not in future 'be deposited at the police-office of the town in which the traveller is staying, he will need no " permission of sojourn," but will have to enter his name, profession, &c., in the strangers' book directly after his arrival at the hotel7 4. After the traveller has had his passport vPis on the frontier, he will not be subjected to the inconvenience of showing it again during his journey. I give this summary because several of the directors of the police establishments in the provinces are inimical to the new system, and it is possible that one or other of them may attempt to go beyond his tether. The Wiener Zeitung of this morning contains the list of the persons forming the supreme command ("O(TerCommando") of the army; and it is worthy of mention that three-fourths of them are either plebeians or men who have recently received the title of nobility. The chief of the " Ober-Commando" is the Archduke William, who has always been a
great favourite with the Emperor. The only other I person of ancient family in the list of persons in whose hands rests the supreme command of the army is Prince Joseph Lobkowltz, who is at the head of the "remount department."
The Frankffoat JTournal has learnt that a priest would not permit the body of an Austrian Staff Officer-an Englishman, of the Protestant faith-to be buried in a family vault which he had had constructed in a churchyard that is near some property which he possessed in Moravia. As Count Schaffgotsch, the diocesan of Brann, fully approved the conduct of the priest, the remains of the officer were interred outside the churchyard !
The Princess BaryatinBld, the wife of theRissian Commander in the Caucasus, has recently embraced the Roman Catholic faith at Rome. Monsignore William fford, a son of Lord Clifford, has been nominated bishop in par-lbu of some new diocese recently created by Hs Efoliness in England. The ceremony of consecration took place on the 26th of last month.
The Oesterreichische Zeitung positively asserts that the Emperor of Russia will go to Paris in the spring.
Representation Of Glasgow.-Glasgow, Thurs-
PLEPRRSENTATIOAN Ocr GIbSGow. -GLAsaow, Thurgday.-The Sheriff, Sir Archibald Alison, has fixed Monday for the nomination of a inember to fill the seat vacAnt by the resignation of Mr. John M'Gregor. Mr. Walter Buchanan, a gentleman of very high character and standing as a merchant, and Universally respected as a private citizen, has, as formerly stated, asreed to come forward. His requisition has been signed by gentlemen belonging to all sections of the Liberal party, as well as by a considerable nuimber of liberal Conservatives. It appears, however, that
te event is not lkely. to p3ss over wnthout a contest. In an address published this moning M1r. James Merry has offered himself to the electors. He is a wealthy ironmaster, principally known as a patron of the turf; but haS neither education nor social status at all sufficient to justfy his aspiring to be the successor of even John 'Gregor. He has money enough, however, to enter the lists, and pluck enongh to fight it out. His address is received with more derision than respect. This afternoon Mr. Buchanan heldhis first meeting with the electors in the Trade-hall, which was crowded to suffocation, the Lord Provost in the chair. LI the course of his address the candidate briefly declared his political principles, referring to the prominent part he had taken, when a young man, in the aetation for Parliamentary Reform, and also for the repeal of tho corn laws, and the advancement of the free trade policy. He was ready to extend the franchise with the progress of education, and he gave a modified adherence to the ballot, in so far as he thought, without being made national, it might be extended to those districts of tho country where it wvas needed. In reference to Forbes Mackenzie's Act, which so much agitated Scotland, he was disposed to retain what was mndoubtedly good in the measure, but at the same time would vote for a conimittee to inquire into its alleged oppressive operations. In reference to education he would , 1Mergly support suoh a measure as that introduced last session by the Lord Ad. vocate. Mr. Buchanan waxs interrogated at the close of his address, but beyond stating that ne would not vote for annual Parliaments and household suffrage nothing of moment was elicited. On the moiion of Mr. Stewart, the late Lord Provost, seconded by Mr. H. Crane Ewin, Mfr. Buchanan was declared a fittingpersontorepresent Glasgow in Parliament; after which the meeting separated.
COLISION AT SEA.-The New York and Liverpool packet ship Great Western, Captain Fnrber, had arrived at New York in a crippled condition, having, been run into during a very dark nLight by a vessel name unknown. The ship was by the wmd, with a good breeze, and the passengers (emigrants) were below m their berths, when all of a sudden the bowsprit of a larIe ship was seen peering through the darkness; Captain Furber saw the apparition, but had only time to utter a loud command for every man to take care of himself when the crash followed. The stranger came quartering on to the Great Western, from forward, strikdng her exactly amidships on the star. board side, her bowsprit first encountering the mainmast
which was broken into four pieces, and cazried over tha weather rail, the maintopmast coming down endwise and passing tbrough the deck on the starboard side, breaking on a deck beam in Its descent, and ripping up the planks of the deck for a space of ten feet; the yards and everything attached to the mainmast fell like an avalanche of wrecked matter upon deck, together with the mizentopmast and its yards. The ship's dde was badly crusbed in above the lower deck, four of the heavy beams were broken, with all the carlins between. The dek was ripped up, and the whole topwork amidships received 6 terrible shock. Strange to say, not a person was killed amid this fearful crah. A woman and five children slept in the berths directly under -where the topmast penetrated the deck, but they were not harmed. A spare mainyard, which lay fore and aft along the waterways, inside of strong tiinber-heads, was broken off, and no doubt prevented a worse disaster to the side of the ship. Not a word was exchanged between the vessels, and the unknown ship swung clear, leaving the fragmnets of her headwork upon the decks of the Great Western. The wreck wAs cleared away as soon as possible, the topmast being sawed in two, and the lower half left between decks. The holes in the side and on deck were covered with boards and casivas to keep out the sea and the fallg rain and snow. The next mnorning Captainx Furber saw a-ship ithout a bowsprit and crtwater, which he judged to be t ship that ad ran Into him. The sbip displayed hlr numbers, but thor being little wind to blow them out, he cul anot mae v tha out.

In the colonial produee-markets during the week the transactions have been on a reduced scale, but quotation min most cases have shown steadiness. ISugar has been the principal exception, a decline of 6d. to ls3. having been oecoasionally subraitted to at the publi sales to-day, although the supplies brought forward were very moderate. The coffeemarket is unchanged. Native Ceylon maintains the recent improvement, and good plantation continues scarme. The present high rates of the former have attracted supplies from the Continent. There has been a further inquiry for floating cargoes, and two of St. Domingo realized 54s. to Ms. 3d. White rice meets a with steady sale for export, rather a large business having been transacted at full rates for parcels in British ships. No movement of importance has occurred in spice, most descriptions being firm. Saltptre was quiet auring the greater part of the week, but several pareels from the United States offered to-day found buyers at full prices. The stock is still comparatively light. In the teamarket the operations have been confined to the iYnunediate requirements of the trade, owing to the unceertainty respecting the reduction of the duty.

An invention has been introduced by Messrs. Underwood and Burt for enabling press copies to be taken of documents which combine printed with written matter. Mostof the prncipal rallway com panies state that it will be of extraordinary service to them In economizing tine and labour. At the Post-offlice likewise, and all other Government offices and establishments where forms are used with printed headings, it is calculated to meet a want that has long been felt. The invention simply consists of a printing ink which, with the ordinary copyng press, will give off an impression on copying paper analogous to that of writing ink.

'fei~e rformance.of an sgreement between Ur. Adria

' .RoundellPaIner, . Amxphiet, and' Mr. Kenyoa supported the order of Us Mater of the Rl0is; the Attor. ney-General and Mr. Terrt; were sounsel for the appellant, BIr. Hope.
Lord Justice XIGITra Bnuonsa id hea zdhere& to tihe opinion which he gae at the time of the argument, thattif the agreement in question wag to be constroed as san Engl sh document, and was to be interpreted acoordinto the ules of English law, the demurrer was plainly right. It hd, however, been said that the document was to be interp,reted as a French instrument. If that were so, had it beenL shown that it was valid accotding to the French law? Did the bill stte with suffcient distinctness the rules of the French law upon the subject, and did the document infringe the rules of the English law? None of those questions couldin his Lordshlips opinion be answered in the plaintiff's favour. The docUenct, It was tru, was in the French language, thoughL translated in the bill; the lady was a nativ exo Fsranc, anad the donicile of both parties was Frenoh, though the "Arriage was performed in England. The bill did not sdate enolgh to show thst the French law oulht to gove thes cae, nor dio rt state enough of thatlaw. twas to be asumed thapt John HeOnr Hope was an Infant, a ile undoubtedly was awardof thisCourt.

Lord Jstivo c, TuP.Nr asaid that the opinion which hi
learned brother had stted at thehearingon behalf of both their Lordship had usn eoreiideration toen confirmed. It had been argued that te French law should be taken into account in the interpretation of the arment, for that it would by* the French law be A valil contract, and that Itherefore the Courts of this country ought to, enforce it. Mis Lordship, however, thought it far from clbrt that the law of France could lao taken into coniLderatai~i ; but this Was clear, that when an ageement was entered into ia a foreign country whinch was contrary to the policy of the law of England the Courts of this country would nout enforce it. The law of Enigland gave the cUstody of inants to their father, not to please his caprice, but for the benefit of tbe childrent, and it watched the relation of hisband. and wife with particular jealousy as regarded its indig. solubleness except b the act of the Legislature. Now, the first article that 9. Jeau Henry Hlope shouldi rentainin the custody of Mrs. Hope expressly contravened the policy of the English law, andalso it was in direct defiance of an order of the Lord Chancellor.

RE COUNTIES UNION ASSURACZ COMPANY.
Mr. BoxBuRGu, for the official manager, moved to discharge or vary the certificate of the Master allowing the claim of Mr. voseph Wilkinsonas a debt against the company for W50l. The claim was disputed by the contributories before the Master, and it was contended that the debt ought to be established at law before it was allowed by the Master as such. Questions vere raised as to the alleged advances of mone andthevaidity of certain promissorynotes and bills of exchange, gurporting to be accepted forthecompany. In support of the proposition that the Mster ouht to have allowed it as a claim only, the cases of "the Norwich Gas Company" (21, L. J., 822), and " the Sun Fire Assurance Company, ex parte Gwyn" (19 Jur., 300), were Cited.
Mr. BOLT and Mr. SPEED, for the claimant, said they did not feel this as aclar.unisputeddebt, but that the claim. ant ad satisfied the Master that the objections made were not sustained, and, unless the Court decided that in every case where the claim was disputed it ought not to be allowed by the blaster as a debt, this certificate ought notto be disturbeod.
The VICCsNcxLLo. said that the question seemed to have been in the cases cited whether there was in fact a fair question to be tried; if so that it ought to go to la. In Ithe case of " Terrell v. Hutton," in the House of Lords,
the judgment proceeded upon the as5amption that the case wssaperfectlyclearone, upon which no question could fairly be raised. The certificate mustbe-taried by allowing this claim as a claim only, with liberty to the claimant to brig such action as he might be advised; the costs of the official manager on this motion to be paid out of the estate. n

RE PERKiNs' SCHOOL, IN THE PAISH OF BAsROW-ON-
SOAR, LmCIHERSaRE
A question was raised in this case as to whether, upon the construction of the will of the founder of the above school, it was a grammar school within the intent and mueaning of the 3d and 4th of Victoria, cap. 77. entitled " An Act for Improving the Condition and Extendimg the Benefits of Grammar Schools." Humphrey Perkins, rector of HolmePierrepoint, in the county of Nottingham, by will, dated in 1717, gave real estate to the vicar of Barrow-on-Soar and to the rector of Loughborough for the time being, upon trust to pay the rents thereof to the schoolmaster of Barrowv-onSoar, he being a graduate of one of the Universities, and teaching and instructing the children of that town, after they could read the Bible, grtis in all sorts of learning By section 10 of the 3d 4th of Victoria, cap 77, it is enacted that the duties and emoluments of then existing schoolmasters shal not be affected by the Act without their consent, and the following section enacts that the appointment of any schoolmaster subsequent to the Act shal not be thereby affected, nless prose in ancery for the purpose shall be commenced within Six months after the vacanoy which shal have occasioned his *npointtuent. By section 25th it is enacted that the words ' grammar school" shall mean and include al endowed schools, whether of Royal or other foundaton, founded, endowed, or maintained forthe purpose of teaching Latin and Greek, or either of such languages, whether in the instrument of foundation or endowment, or in any other evidences or documents, such instructions shall be expressly described, or descrbed by the word " grammar," or any other form of expression which is or may be construed as intending Greek or IAtin; and whether by such evidences or documents as aforesaid, or in practice, such Instruction be limited exclusively to Greek or Latin, or extended to both such languages, or to any other branch or branches of literature or science,in addition to them or either of them. The present master of the school was appointed in 1847, and it appeared that at that period there were several scholars at the school who were being prepared for the Universities. In November, 1850, an order was made upon the petition of the vicar of Barrow and the reetor of Loughborough, presented in the preceding July, and entitled in Sir Samuel Romilly's Act (52d George IlL, cap. 101), directing a reference to the Masiter of the Court to settle a scheme for the management of the chaity. A scheme embodying considerable alterations in tho education to bo given at the school had been accordingly carried on before Mster Humnphry bhut the master of the school objected to it, and contended that the school was to be considered as a granmmar school, and tbhat his appointment was for life, and that he was not removable from his office. The vicar of Barrow-on-Soar and the rector of Loughborough now presented their petition, praying for a declaration by the Court whether on the construction of the will of the founder the school was a grammar school within the intent and meaning of the 3d and 4th of Victoria, cap. 77. It was contended on behalf of the petititners and of the Attorney-General that there was notling in the terms of the will of the founder vwhich rendered it compulsoryon the masterto teachLatin and Greek, or either of them, and that in that state of things the school wwasnot a grammar school within the legalacceptation of the term as laid down byLord Eldon,and thatif the Court should declare tbat the school came within the provisions of the 3d and 4th of Victoria, cap. 77, the present master would, under section 10 of the Act, be free from the control or interference of the Court during his tenure of office, inasmuch as the proceedings in this court relative to the school had not o Vnated until three years after his appointment.
Mr. J. VlTerrell appeared for the petitioners, and Mr. Wickens for the Attorney-General.
Mr. BACON, for the master of the school, did not object ta adjourn the consideration of the scheme to the Vice Chancellor's chambers
The VICE-CHANCELLOR, after referring to the terms of the will of Humphrey Perkins, founding and endowing the school, and to section 25 of the 3d and 4thl of Victoria, cap. 77, and stating that instraction in Latin and Greek was in praCtice at the school, said that he never saw a case less free from diOflicUtyas t the appliaton of the Act It wasnot necessary deide the question of the nature of the tenure of the present master's of fice. He should adjourn

COURT OF OUEENS EENfRl fT-TTTTT. ? on
SMTlYII V. LAX6AN_
(Before Lord Chief Ju,tice CAiP.B and a 4ecia
Jttm.
lir ;. Thesiger, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Kingdon appeared for the plaintiff ; and Mr. Sereant Byles, Mr. Eward James, QpC., hr. Manisty, and 2r. Dickinson (of the Chancery bar) for the defendant.
The trial of this case, which had already occupied three whole days, was concluded this day.
The case came before this Court by direction of the Lords Justices of Appeal in Chancery, who had directed 14 issues in fact to be tried before the Lord Chief Justice and a specal jury.
It appeared the plaintiff, William, King Smith, was an Amencan and a native of Viriia, and he had faled a bill in Chancery against the defendant, Stephen Charles Lakeman, a sharedealer, of No, 2, Exchange-buildings, in which he prayed that an account might be taken of the dealings of
eman with 10,100 shares in a scheme called the Liberty 3lining Company. An account vas taken, and, the matter being referred back by the Vice-Chancellor, an appeal was carried to the Lords Justices. The case was there heard, and the parties were examined it,a rwe. The examinations and cross-examinations of the parties and their witnesses occupied the Lords Justices for about 12 days, but their Lordships were baffled in their attempt to arrive at the truth. ln the result their Lordships came to the con. cludon that in a case of such a nature, the evidence being most conflicting, the most satisfactory course would be to have the several issues submitted to a special jury in this court. The case has accordingly been here tried, and if any proof were wanting of the superiority of the Nisi Priuns test of truth that proof must have been aflorded by the spectacle exhibited in this conut during the last three days. The parties in the case,
each of whom charged the other with being criminals of. the darkest dye, guilty of perjury, and forgery, and fraud, 'ad to stand for hours in the face of the Court snd an intelligent and expectant special jury, and there ibe subjected to a test of cross-examination from which it would be difficult indeed for the most cunning artificer of fraud to escape without detection. We say nothing of the qualifications of the learned Lord Chief Justice, of whose abilities it would be presumptuous in us to speak, sud we merely allude to his Lordship's experience for half * century. But we may state that upon those witnesses the power ot the most distinguished advocates at the bar, sharpened by daily practice of nearly 30 and 40 years, was brought to bear with such effect that when the trial was concluded we believe that no intelligent observer in court could entertain a doubt as to what the result should be. After such a dissection-we might almost caU it a chymical analysis of the witnesses -the jury found their verdict for the defendant on all the issues, and his Lordship stated that he should report to the Lords Justices that he was quite satisfied with the verdict. It is impossible for us to do more than give a br:ef outline of one or two of the questions at issue, which, as before stated, arose out of certain transactions which the parties had had with one another and a man named Robert Andrew Riddell, in connexion with certain American mining speculations. The defendant, who called himself a sharedealer, but who kept no clerks and nobooks, was formerlyin business in George-yard, Lombard-street, and latterly at No. 2, Exchange-buildings. The plaintiff Smith, or Captain Smith, as he was called. being, as he said, the owner of some valuable tracts of mining land in North America, came over to England in 1850, and had since resided in this country, in Goldensquare. In the month of August, 1852, he apphed to the defendant to sell 10,000 shares which the plaintif held in the Liberty Mining Company. At that time the shares were much depreciated in value, in consequence, as it was alleged, of the conduct of the directors in throvwing them upon the market. They were still nominally quoted at 1 premium, bht they were unsaleable at that price. The defendant was apphed to by the plaintiff to "clear the market," huxt before he would undertake this office he required a guarantee. In fine, 10,000 shares were intrusted to the defendant as security, it being agreed that Smith, Lakeman, and Riddell should each have one-third of any sum which Lakeman might get for the shares beyond the 11. which hAd been paid upon them. Subsequently, according to the defendant's case, the parties came to an account on the 22d of January, 1853, whereby the plaintiff Smith admitted that he had received from the defendant lakeman the sum of 12,4931. lOs., being advanced by the defendant to the plaintiff, and which sum was to be repaid out of the proceeds of the shares and securities the defendant held of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff now set up, as he had done in his bill in Chancery, that this paper, which he admitted he had signed, had been obtained of him by fraud, anid that he (the plantiff) was induced to sign it by the defendant's statement that it was necessary that he should have such a document, in order that he might produce it in his answer to a bil in Chancery filed by a person named Samuel Eames Low. The plaintiff aiso stated that in order to -nake it an effectual answer to Low's claim the account, which was in reality signed on *the 20th of February, was antedated on the 22d of January. The defendant's case was that this statement was all false, and that the paper had been signed by the plaintiff at the defendant's office on the day of its date, the 22d of January. after aU the vouchers had been produced to the plaintig and he had signed a paper by which he agreed to cancel the agreement of the 19th of August, 18$2, under which the shares had been oriOinaly deposited with the defendant. This was the main isse in question, all the others being more or less connected with it. Theother principal issue was whether a paper which the p laintiff amitted he had signed, and which was dated the 23d of March, 1i853, was in the same state when it was signed as it was now. In its present state this document purported to recognise the account of the 22d of January as a true account, but, according to the plaintiff's statement, it bad been mutilated by cutting off the heading, which related to the affairs of some company. The plaintiff also stated that a forgery had been comnuitted by the defendant in inserting an account over the defendant's signature in a blank space left for the signatures of souae directors. This was denied by the defendant, who said it was a genuine document, signed in the state in which it now appeared by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had said the paper was originally a sheet of fooIscap, but the defendant called several witnesses who proved by several circumstances that it was written on a sheet of note-paper opened, and, that the crease which it contained could only have been produced by machinery, and not by the hand. These were the two inain questions, upon which the decision of the ether issues mainy turned.
Lord CA.aBuLIa, at the sitting of the Court this mornig, summed up the evidence. His Lordship said the Lords Justices had directed these issues to be tried by a special jury, and very properly, for where there was conflicting evidence, as in tis case, his Lordship was of opinion that no tribttnal had ever been invented by man, or ever would be, that was so well calculated for the in. vestigation of truth and securing the ends of justce as a trial before 12 jurymen. His Lordsh said he should make some observations on the facts, but thOe jur
would only attend to those observations so far as they agreed in them, for the questions at issue were entirely for the decision of the jury. The j'ury were aware that the qunestcions arose ot t Of the bill which the plaintiff bad filed for hn account, to which the defendant had anaswered that he owed the Vlaintiffnothing. If the documents in uestion were genuine documents his Lordsbip thought the defendant had a good answer to the plaintiff'sla.Thppe of the 22d of January admitted that athe defedThe advanced to the plaintiff the sum of 12.4931.. a
document of the 23d of Warch admitted that all the shares bad been accounted for. But Smith said the d ts were not genuine, though they both bore his signature, and that a balance was due to him. If the jury should find that tbe document of theo22d of January, 1S55, was genuine, they would also find that all the sums therein specified had been advanced to the plaintiffT and that the plaintiff had adn,ittedthat he had received all those sums. But the plaintiff alleged that that document was not genuine, that it was signed by the plaintiff for an improper purpose, and that he, document of the 23d of March had als
been *nmpe:l with, by being mutilated, and something being -wntl in a apace which the plaintifrfleft blaik 'when he d8ne'cd it. Certainly, the plaintiff did come b-efore the jury.. in a very uinfavourable manner. He belonged, indeed, to,a nation derived from the same origin is ourselves? speaking the same language, and enjoying very similar inshtittions-a untion which did great credit to the country from owhich- it had descended; hut the plint.ffs own learned comisel was obliged to admit that ho (the pla3. tiff) ad become a o accoplice in a fraud which he said was

SUTTON V. TIM SPErOTACL-MAR fS! CO5MPANY.
Mr. Serjeaut Pigott and Mr. Brewer appeared for the plaintiff, and SirS. Thesiger and Mr. Lush for the defendants.
Mr. BRXmR stated that this wasan action for work and labour, to which the defendants had pleaded never indebted.
Mr. Ser%eant PrGoTT, in stating the case, said the action was brought by the plaintiff, Mfr. Sutton, the attorney, to recover from the Spectacle-makers' Company the sum of 1,4001., being the plaintifs bill of costs incurred in conducting for the defendants and other companies an oppostion to a Bil1 in Parliarent called the London Corporation BilL It appeared that the Lord Mayor and Corporation of I ondon hasd brought a BiU into Parliament m the year 1852. A Common Hall was called to consider whether the bill was palatable; and, it being decided that it was not, it was determined to oppose the Bil in Parliament. The corporation, however, determined to go on with the BilL The Mercers' Company determined to oppose it, and on the 31st of March a meeting of 30 or 40 companies was held, at which the defendants were well represented. Sir Walter Riddell, the prime warden of the Spectacle-makers' Company, and the other warden attended. Sir WalterRiddeL stated the objections of his own company to the measure, and, what was material, he said that
though the meeting could bind itself, it could not bind the companies which it represented. He therefore suggested that delegates frora the several companies should be invited, and he moved a resolution that steps should be taken to take the opinion of the companies. That resolution was put and carried. The other warden, Mr. Clarkson, the barrister, since dead, moved vesecond resolution, and the meeting was adjourned. On the 19th of April another meeting was held, when Sir Walter Riddell reported that a special
meeting of his company had been held, and that. they approved everything which had been done by the Mercers' Company, and that they thought the bill ought to be opposed. On the 11th of MTay the plaintiff was appointed to con duct the opposition, and also a sub-committee,
of which SirWal erlliddeli xwas a member, The oppositiona was made, and Sir Walter Riddell made a speech whichinduced the committee to throw out the Bill. There might be some question raised in the course of the trial as to whether the plaintiff could make out a case in pint of law, in consequence of theplaintiff's retainer not bein under the corporate seal o the company. E would, therefore, read a passage from Sir Wslter Riddell's speech, in which he spoke of the measure as "a Bill which mUost assuredly did go s far s a Bi could go to destroy, 'without the slightest proof of abuse or forreiture, of injury or wrong done to the public or any indiVidual, the exclusive right and privileges of the liverymen and freemen without compensation-to destroy rights which in the greater number of instances had been purchased by these men, in accordance with the resolutions, and with the sanction of the Court of Common Council,"
Lord CAMPBEALL inquired whether the question to be tried was one of liability, or as to the quantum I
Sir F. THEsIGaI said that with the exception of a sum of 801., which was for services rendered by the plaintiff before the 11th of May, which, of course, he could not recover, the guestion was entirely one of liability. The defence was that there was no retainer under the common seal of the company.
Lord CAPBELrL observed that the law upon the subject was in an unsatisfactory state.
Sir F. TREIGEnom said there had been some Rutai

Mr. Serjeant PiooT saida ho was aware of that case and that his learned friend had not stated it quite correctly The facts, however, of this case would not, he believed, be atall disputed.
Sir P. Tizesoxi said he believed the facts would not be disputed. Sir Walter lliddel1 was authorized to attend the meeting.
Lord CAaU'nzu. said be thought the better course would be to state the facts in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court, and judgment might be obtained in
Mr. Serjeaut PiGonr said the plaintiff would want the company's charter-a request which was assented to.
A verdict was therefore taken by consent for the plain. tiff, subject to the opinion of the Court on a special case, to be settled, in case of difference, by Mr. Cook Evans
aOBBiRS V. XiRFOOT.
Mr. lHawkins appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Turner for the defendant.
The plaintiff, Thomas Roberts, was a surgeon and apothecary in Bridge-street, Southwark, and he sued the defendant, Thomas Kerfoot, a publican at Stockwell, to
recover the sum. of 467. 6s. 7d., being the amount of the; plantffsbill for his attendance as a surgeon and mnedicines supplied to the defendant's wife. From the plaintiff's evidence it appeared that in the month of June, 1850, he was called in to attend the defendant's wife, and continued to do so daily, and often twice a-day, down to the beginning of October. The defeadant at that time was hiving in the New M-orth-road Hoxton, and was keeping a public-house. there. The plaintiff paid in all about 70 visits, han to treat his patient forprolapus uteri and femoral hernia Wvith the assistance of the surgeon from Guy's Hospital the hernia was reduced, and the patient recovered of her other complaints, though she died afterwards of consumption. The plaintiff charged 5s. for each visit, and when the defendant removed to Warwick-place, Pimlico, he charged 7s. 6d., and generally at Hoxton charged for two visits each day. The rest of the bill was made up of charges for various mnedicines, which the plaintiff said were necessary for the cure of the defen-
daiit'swife from the diseaseunder which she was labourn.. The plaintiff was cross-examined to show that theca
was a medical, and not a surgical case, and that he had undertaken to attend as a friend, upon the understanding that he sihould have refreshments, dinners, wines, and spirits, &c,, in lieu of paymient. The plaintiff denied this suggestion, though lire admitted that he often had token refre-shmen't at the defendant's house, and had had wine (two dozen) sent to him by the defendant. At the close of the plaintiff's
ir. Tuim submitted that the plaintiff had no cae. The bill was an apothecary's bill, and the Apothecaries Act required that before an apothec could recover on such a bill he should ove that at the tire he war a licentiate of the company. he learned counsel cited the " Apothecajies Company v. Lotinga" (2 2.L and R., 495).
Lord IrAmP.RELL said there was evidence to go to the jury; that was all he would say.
Mr. TUrca-ER then examined the defendant, who stated. that in June, 1850, he called idn the pleaintiff to attend his wife for consumption, and thathe attended
upon the understanding that he should have refreshmens dinners, &c.? free of charge. lle said ho had at one time sent the plaintiff a dozen of wine, at another BiX bottleso whisky, and at another six bottles of ruin. He also ro
duced an account of refreshments which he said the pfarutiff had had at his house. This amounted to about 221., and, if correct, showed that the plaintiff had nearly every day dined at the defendant's house, and taken ale, wine, brandyand-water, cigars, &C.
The plaintiff had accounted for the delay in enforcing his demand by saying that when he asked the defendant for payment of his bill the defendant pleaded his inability to PaY. The defendant, however, stated that for some years the plaintiff had made no demand at all, and he relied upon the length of time which had elapsed since October, 1856 as confirmation of his statement as to the terms on which the plaintiff had attended.
Lrd CAI6IPnELL, in summing up the evidence, said the furst question for the jury was whether the plaintiff had attended onathe terms suggested by the defendant, for, if so, he could not recover, If the jury thought there was no such arement they maust then see how mauch of the plaintin ,he bill was for attendance and medicines s lied ass surgeon. For so much the plaintiff could recover. But, as to the services and medicines supplied by the plaintiff as an akpothecary, the plaintiff could not recover, for in the -year 1850 he was not a licenUtia fteApteaie?Cm pany, though he was so n2ow, . o h pteais on

The plaintiff, who had been taken out of his bed, was locked up all night, and the next day he was taken before a magistrate and discharged.
Mr. Sereant THoxAs, in the course of the trial, asked to be allowe to withdraw the plea of justification; but this being refused, the lesrned secleant called the defendant to prove that he had given the paintiff the moneyto paw for the lead. The learned serjeant, in summingup his evidence, was about to contend that technically he had proved the plea of justification. but
LOrd CAMPBELL interposed, and said that he thought the policeman's law was the best. (Laughter.)
The learned SEB'RANT then said he would adopt the policeman's law; and he contended, in mitigation of damages, the defendant bad acted under a mistaken noti6n that he was justified in the course he bad taken.
1r. WILrD, in his reply, contended that the course taken by the defendant in pleading a plea of justification was a great aggravation of -the offeuce of giving the plaintiff into custody. on such a charge.
Lord CanwnrB.r, in sum=ing up, said the only questioP for the jury was as to the amount of damages.

Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for plaintiff; and Mr. Bovill and Mr. Holland for the deFen:dmants.
The declaration alleged that the defendants had received certain goods of the plaintiff, undertaking to carry the same from Norwich to London, and safely to deliver the same. The defendants pleaded six pleas, denying everything.
The plaintiff ad been a medical botanist at Norwvcb, but nowkot a pablichouse in London. Being about to leave Xorwich, and remove to London he sent his goods by the defendants' railway. Among other things were three casks, -one of'which contained gas fittings and drugs. The casks were delivered in London, but upon opening this particular cask it was founxd to contain nothin bg t clogs. The plaintiff then went to the station and stated the facts, and the clerk said he would make inquiries. After some time the persons atthe station said the cask had been opened by a person lho stated that he had come from the plaintif
and was authorized by him to take out the things the cask contained. The value of the articles taken Was Upwards of
The plaintiff stated that when the cask arrived at his own premnises he had directed it to be opened, and that it contanedclogs, and not his things. He had had a man named Hughes in his employ, but ne had discharged him three weeks before he left Norwich. The plaintiff; incross-
examination, said his business was something like Mr. Bovill's-to make peoRle believe everything he could. He sid he had once practised in the regular profesdion, but he had been disgusted with it, and had then become a medi6a botanist, and delivered lectures, pointing out the value of herb. Hughes sometimes addressed the peop'e, but he was not sufficiently accomplished to persuade the people.
The plaintidts wife swore that she packed Up this cask, and it was sent off to the station the night before she left Norwich. Hughes assisted her in packinig, hut he did not taNkoethe thingstothe station. The railwaymen came with their vans to the plaintiff's house in Norwich, and took away the thisngs to the station.
A person named Heppel peeked up this very cask with the gasfittings and drugs. He unpacked the cask in London, ~d there were no gasSttings or drugs, but it was filled with clogs. Was a public lecturer on botany, at
The defence first was that the jury could not believe the plaintiff; then that Hughes was the -man who acted in -every way, taldng the things to the railway station at Norwich; then, that it was not true that the gas fittings were peked in a cask, that they were put into a crate ; that Hughes then went to the station and said that there was a mistake in putting up the gaS fitting, and he took them all out of the crate.
J. B. Flower assisted in packing the goods. Hughes also assisted. The gas fittings were not taken down until the day after Mrs. Marriott had stated. They were packed in a crate, and not in a cask. Hughes went with the goods to the railway station.

THE MARIA.-CLAnl FOR RESTITUTIJOX OF SH AND
F_GB3lTr.
iBeforeDr. LDamSmqaoi- I
Dlr. JU5UINGTOIq delvered judgment In this case, the facts of which were reported in The Times of the 17th and I8th of December last. The veesel, he said, sailed under Belgian colours and was captured off Cork on the 27th of October, 1855, by a revenue cruiser, where two of the witnesses were examined. On the 16th of November a claim 'was given in by M1r. John Batten, a shipbroker of this city, for the ship and freight, as the property of Gustave Edouard Frangois Huger and Joseph Ignace Henry Huger, of the city of Antwerp, merchants. The Court, according to law and ractice, looked, in the first imtanee, to the evidence taken iln preparatory, and the 2hip's papers Petit, the master, was examined, and ho swore thatEte was appointed to she command of the ship by C. J. Sass and
Huer, shipbrokers at Antwerp, and that he took possession of her there in October, 154. He also stated that he had heard that the ship was built at Gamla Karleby, and it was so alleged in her certificate of classification. He further 2aid that 0. J. Sass and F. Huger were the owners of the ship; when seized there was no bill of sale on board, and he had never seen any. Under such circumstances it was impossible, with the least regard to the principles unifornly acted upon by this Court, to restore the vessel without further proof; and the Court orderedfurther proof accordingly. He bad now, therefore, to oondder what was the effect of the original evidence coupled with the further proof-whether the claim already given in was austained by such evidenee- and, if not, what course the Court ought to ursue. Two tiin gs must be proved,-flirst; that the t er being sad to have taken place during war from the enemy, that fact must be clearly established-it must be shown most distinctly that aU the interest of the enemy in this ship had been clearly divested; and, secondly, that the claimants were the na c owrs The learned Judge then examined very miutely the history of the transaction as it a peared in the pleadings. The 13th article alleged that after the death of the former master Bass nd Huger, with the sanction of the owners, appointed Petit master; that he bad no knowledge of the sale or purchase, and was not accurately aware of the names and aescriptions of the real owners. That was one of the most extraordinary averments which ever found its way into a
rize case It being one of the very first principles of prize saw thaththe master should be well acquainted with hia owners, and be able to give satisfactory evidence as to the ownership of the vessel. The evidence in preParatory supported none of the averments contained in the allegation. The next step was to consider the ship's papers, what they did contain, and what they did not. ln the register issued at Antwerp, May 31, 1854, the vessel was described as the property of Huger and Co., and the Court saw no reason to Kout t things were not done as therein stated. There were many other formal papers, and they all tended to prove, what, indeed, could not be said to be in controversy,
that the ship was received into the Belgian mnercantile
navy, recognized by the authorities as belonging to it, and that she sailed on sundry voyages as a Belgian vesseL Evidence as to the original transfer there was none. Was there any evidence showing the resent ownership? If the master who was cognizant of aR the documents%efore the Court, and much more, cane to the conclusion that C. J.
Sass and F. Huger were his owners, it was qtuite clear that
the Court could not rrive at a different opinion from the same documents. The proctor for the claimant had examnined eight witnesses on his alleg ation, and there were also a number of documents annexed to it. An allegation bad also been given In on behalf of the seizors, the object of
which was to eiliow that Huger rand Co. were not the owners,
and if such should be the fact, of course rertitution could not pass to themi. The allegation in substanre aleged that Sass and F. Huger, together with Mr. Jackson, were the owners. Hle would now Cstate on what conclusions as to facts and on what principles his judgment must stadd. Thu
ip wase laimeas the propertyof Messmr . Huger and Co., RXanJoseph Hueer. They were Belgian subjects andneutrals.
The ship was Oigienally Russian, and enemy's property, hut
if she was hondeCurtchased by them, and bond jce transferred to them, the law of nations, as adiinistred by
this Court, acknowledged the transaction, and if the
facts were proved they were entitled to regtitution, atcttiono the Cohrt tanh t were not proved to the satisfactioneof the Couxt tlkitablis vesl was bifdjNe bought by Huger ad Co. and was now their property, she nust be condemned. It did not matter who were the owners if teywere no uger and Co. Thi wasnotacase inwhich
it was possible th at the claim could be amended it had not onLybeenima,de, but persisted in. The solo inquilry,
therefore, was the transfer to Huger and Co. If Sass -d Huger were the owne s there could not be rcstitution, not
becauase the transaction might be contrary to Belgian law,for of that the Court tGook no notice,-but becatuse tesy
were not the claimants. For the same reason, it Jackson and Co. were diu owners of the ship, there could not be
restitution. Ifoari'anants were trustees for other persons
who 'were the equitable owners, if such equitable owners could claim as neutrals, then if the whole facts had been disclosed in the first instance the Court thought there Cmight be restitution. He was of opinion that there bad been a bond frde transfer by the Russian owners, but the question was whether they sold her to the preont claimants. That the money was remitted through the tedium of Sass and Huger to Mr. Weddel
he saw no reasonL to doubt ; that one single six~pence was
ever paid by Huger and Co., he did not believe,cole did not ebeieve it for the following reasons: that payment of the
puchase-mooney, if paid at all, must be in the books of
uger and Co. and easr and huger, and might have been proved by an authentic extract from those bke bot. e a would have been the best evidence, and, as there was no reason assigne why it should not have been produced, he gretly doubted if he was at liberty to receive any scndary ein; but, presuming thatehe could overcome that obdsle, the secondary evidence was that of the witness, and, that evidence contradicted the plea, and the testimony of each witness was at variance with that of the other. He
was o f ojpinion that the evidence to establish the
cLaim wo and totally failed, and that was the
only question he was caled upn to decde. He was not called upon to say whether asus and Huger did not. really purchase this vessel, and in the names
of Huger and Cob to evade Eel n law. It was wholly
perty of thelalinant. he ship must be condemnied with tests.

THE COEOM1DEL..-SAI,VAGE
This ,as adn t brought by the fishing smack William, andtwo steamtugs, the volnateerland the Robert Oshen against the hark Corornandel, to obtain salvage comnpensa. tion for services rendered' to her on the 29th of September last, it the North Sea. A second action was brought by the fishig smack Yonng Erederick to procure a reward for saeing the lires of the crerof the Coromandel. The actions were afterwrds consolidated. Tohe bark, of the burden of 638 tons, laden with deals, was bound from Archangel to Fendon, and according to the statement of the Williar she discovered her in a most perilous condition with no one on hoard. She immediately took measures with a iew to rescue her, and while ao d oing observed the steamutogs and engaged their serves. Aiter 26 hours' labour the bar. was sfely conducted to Yamnouth bosch. The Yonng Frederick alleged that on seeing the balrkin a state of great distress on the 28th of September she went to her aid, and, finding the crew grettly exhausted, took them on hoard, supplied their necessities, and carried them to Yarmouth. It was averred by the salvors that they encoun. tered great peril in rendering the services, which was deuiedbythe owners. The value of the property salved was 2,5191.
Dr. Robinson and Dr. Jenner appeared for the first set of EIVros Dr. Deans for the second set, Dr. Addanis and Dr
Twnor the owvners.
The learned JuDaz wdedso the Young Federick 2001: for saving the lives of the crew, and to the other salvors 5001. for salving the property.
Tnf ACTIF.-SALVAGE.
This wAs a suit promoted by the smack Britain to procurr
salvae reward for services rendered to the bark Actif, in
the orth Sea, on the 28th of September last. This bark also was timber-laden, and was bound from Archangel to London. She waS seen by the salvors with a signal of distr2ss flying, and on bearing down upon her they were requested to render their aid. They boarded her with great
ifficulty, and after 24 hours labour conducted her to Newson Float, where she was taken in tow by a merchant vessel and towed into Grimsby Roads. On the part of the owners it was contended that it was a pilotage service only and that the salvors agreed to take whatever Iloyd's agent at Grinsby or Hull said was reasonable, if it was only 51.
Dr. Jenner ;nd Dr. Deane appeared for the salvors, and D.Bayford and Dr. Spinks for the owners. The learned JtIDGE allotted 100O.
A question then arose as to whether or not the salvors, underthprovisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, were entitled to costs.
The COURT reserved its decision on this point.
THE SPrInT OF THE AGE.
Thisalso was a sdvage suit, andwasintitutedbythesteam tug Secret against the bark Spirit of the Age. Oa the ith u1t., inconsequence of the extreme violence of the gale, several Tessels in the neighbourhood of the Downs were exposed to great peril. The Secret went out to render aid, and, seeing the bark begin to drive fast to leeward, with her head towards the rocky shore, she made all speed towards her. The master ran the tug under her stern, and having hailed her crew to get a hawser ready brought the tug along the leeside of the bark, and across her bows until tho tug's ster was off her weather bow. VaTious D anceuvres were adopted, attended wfith the greatest risk to the tug, and ultimately, although the bark had once reached within a ship's length of the beach, she succeeded in towing her into deep water. The value of the property salved was 62,0001. The owners gave an affirmative issue to the statement of the salvors.
Dr. Bayford and Dr. Spinaks appeared for the steanitug, and Dr. Addamas and Dr. Twiss for the bark.
The learned JUDGE considered that the printing of the affidavts brought in by the salvors was nnaecessary after an affirmative issue, and declined to allow the costs. He awarded the salvors 3,oO0Z., with their other costs.

FRIDAY, FtBB. 27.
(Before MJr. Commi&soner HoLROYD.)
IN R1: A.. CORONsL.
The bankrupt was a cigar manufacturer, in the Minories. This was the certificate meeting.
or. Choidyea5ppeared for the bankrupt, and Mr. Abrahars The bankrupt, who, it will be recollected, had given his6 accommodation acceptances to Thomas Elolland, tobacco broker, was granted a third-class cert-ificate.
12i BE S. SsMMONS. was the certificate meeting.
Mr. Av Jones oppsod * Mr. Lawrance supported.
Hi6 EONOUR held that the bankrupt had traded too long. In January, 1855, on taking stock, he found he had a surplus of but it now appeared that he had made a mistake, and that he was then deficient to the extent of 8007. In 1855 and 1856 he had incurred losses to the extent of 1,2001. on mining shares, to carry on which speculations he nad bad accommodation-bill transactions. It was not a sufficient excuse for these mining *transactions that al traders in Cornw3ll speculated in mining shares: During the last nine months of his trading he had purchased goods to the amount of 5,0001,, of which 3,500l. were made during the last four months. It was not JUst to make purchases of shares, &c., with other people's money, and traders in Corn. wall, as well as elsewhere, who did so must incur the consequences. Some of the bankcrupt's sales of goods had not been in the ordinary way of his business, and, having regard to the whole circumstances, the certificate (second-c ) must be suspended nine montbs. There being no fraud, protection would he granted.
IN RE JOHN POLAND.
The bankrupt is described as a wholesale milliner, of Hart-street, B oomsbury, and elsewhere. This was an exa. mination meeting.
Mr. H. Linldater supported, and Mr. George Lawrence oppoe.
tt appeared that in 1847 the bankrupt was adjudicated bankrupt as a wholesale furrier, in Broadway, Ludgate-hilL Under that bankruptcy his accounts e utended from May, 1844, toMay, 1847, and contained the following items
Unsecured creditors. 7,8801.; liabilities, 1,500k.; good debtors, 1001.; losses, 3,0001.; law costs, 1,0001.; domestic expenses, 3,0801. There were no profits, but there were trade expenses, 7001. The bankrupt failed to pass his oxanimation under that bankrnptcy, and consequently did not receive a certificate. He owes 2,5001. under the present banlkuptct, snd the assets are merely nominal.
It was objected that the present accounts were as unsatisfactory as those of 1847. The reply was that better could not be furnished, the bankrupt not having kept sufficient books, and the papers under the first bankruptcy having been lost since the proceedings of 1847 took place.
The Comnussioms. did not think that the bankrupt could pass on such accounts.
WI.TlaXBATR.L-The effect will be that the bankrupt's examination must be adjourned sine die.
The COnnSSIoNxR.-Looking to the proceedings under the last bankruptcy, I cannot see how anything else could be expected. He appears to have been over head in gambling.
Mr. LAwRinscE-The proceedings under the second bankruptcy disclose the same.
The bankrupt, on examination, said, Mr.Search, who occupied part of the premises in Hart-street, was allowed by him a salary of 41. 4s. p?er week. This was not to preclude her from carrying on business on her own acconnt, as she eaid that it would require 1,0001. a-year to thus restrict her.
Ultimately the COURT ordered an adjournment sine die, with protection for one month.
UT RE LILLICRAP.
Mr. Commissioner GOULBUN stated to his Honour the circumstances under which he had directed this bankrupt, who was a grocer, to be indicted for felony in concealing goods, and also for a misdemeanour in falsifying his books. The bankrupt had been acquitted on the first indictment, and Mr. Serjeant Parry, and another learned counsel engaged for the prosecution, had thereupon recommended the second indictment to be withdrawn. The costs had been taxed by the Crown-office at 3171, and it was asked that the amount should be paid out of the bankrupt's estate and the funds of this court. Thinking it might be a bad precedent to allow the costs of the second indictment, considering the circumstances under which that indictment had been withdrawn, he wished to bavo the opinion of a brother commisdioner.
His HONOUR thought that the costs of both indictments should be paid; and an order was made accordingly.
- N RE . FEAST.
The bankrupt was an oil and Italian warehouseman, of Finsbury-pavement and elsewhere.
This was the certificate meeting.
Mr. idnklater appeared for the assignees, and Mr. W. Yallance for the bankrupt.
His HONOUR granted a third-class certificate.

Mir. BuRcd Ax has received 101. for the poor-box of this court fromw"A Naval Officer," per Goode aind ou Navy Agents, 15, Surrey-street, Strand; also the firstdhalf of a. 51. note, No. 13,769, from "Fred."
LmadBxT.-The -widow of Joseph Jordan, whosehdusbAde had been for years one of the miost active and intelient. officers belonging to the L division of police, waited on ar. Nonox C on Thursday to solicit hisnassstance inder theo following distressing circumstances :-
Prom the poor woman's statement, and from facts within theFrecollection of thembagitrate and all the officersmz onnected with the court, it appeared that In the month of September, 1855, poor Jordan, in the discharge of hisdt
fell foul of a man inamed Mayrid, whophad be ennseriousY* wounded in the Crimea, and who when drunk was a perfect. maniac and savage.In hishoendeavouy sto secure his prisoner Jordan got frightfeuly kicked, so that his kidneysh were seriously injured, and in fact he was maimea for life by his savage assailant. h hadbeen in the WestminsterHos-. pitalfor some time, and had als,obeentreatedbythediviaionz,
nedical officers of the force with considerable attention, and also sent to the country and the seaside, but allr to no purose. The Commissioners of Police Alsoallowed hine hkis full pay for 12 months, and then gave him a pension of 27s. per annum, but he had not long enjoyed the latter. The injuries he received were of too serous a character, and ultimately, after enduring thegreatesttortures that could. wel be conceived, he broke down under them, and was then a corpse.
The poor woman said, that so lonig was her husbandi suffering and so small hs income, and being herself afflicted with illness, that she waLs without the means of burying him herself, andi the Plolice Cornuissioners were without any fund from which theY could relieve her.
Mr. NoRToN remarked, that he knew poor Jordan very well, and a more mneritorious or a better officer he believed did not belong to the police. Hfe (Mlr. Norton) should do all he could, and that was to order a sovereign out of theO poor-box, and recommend the case as one deser-ving the. sym!pathy of a benevolent public.
The poor woman expressed her gratitude to the mags.. trate and withdrew.
Russell Pear, a young 3nan respectably connected,. and who has been in the service of Mr. CGcoke, an auc-. tioneer in the Westminster-read, was brought before the. Ron. G. C. NORTON yesiterday for final examiination on A charge of embezzling various sums of money belonging to his employer.
The prosecutor sad, that finding the sums embessled by the prisoner did not far exceed that which he had stated onx the former examinatioiss, and in consideration of the high respectability of the prisoner's friends, and, farther, hoping that the imprisonment which he had undergone would act. as a check to future dishonesty, it was not his wish to Press the charge, and he should therefore, with his worship's Permnission, consent to his discharge.
Mfr. NORToNf did not think that the prisoner was deserving of mauch commiseration on his own account, thoujgh he. might be on account of the character and respectability of his. family. He was quite well aware that his employer hiad beenpludere moe thn oce bfor bydishonest servants,

CltowN COURT.-(BCfore Mr. Barons MA-¶m.) I Patrick Hig'Ds, Hng& Ege, Thomas Veitch, Samuel leggs, And John Tannock were indicted for the manilaughter of Thomas Higgins, at Carlisle, on the 3d of
.M'Oabry and Mr. Hamnay appeared for the prosecution; Wr. Laurie appeared for the prisoner Higgins; and Mr. Campbell Foster defended the ot er prisoners.
It appeeod from the opening of the learned counsel for 'the prosecution that the four prssoners Rae, Veitch, Beggs, audTind o k, were going home at a little past midnight on the d of Augusthast down Botchergate, in Carlisle, from
the railway, on which they were employeda s engine.drivers, wrhen the;r 'were met by Patrick i;ggins, w;ho rudely forced his wby through them as they were w falking in a ro
in the middle of the street. This led to an observation to im to mind what he was about, wfhen Higgins retorted in coerse language, offered to fight any of them, and knocked gdown Veitun BeggA then attempted to pull off hids acket, ond stepped out into the rOad, offering to fight Jigis if he -wanted to fight. While taking off his jacket Higgins knocked 'cinm down,. The two men then began to fight tonether, and eventually Higgins was knocked dosvu, Bedgg
falling upon bin. At this time the deceased, the father ,of the 6risoner Higins,w came usp, followed by his -wile and daughter, and, crfing out "bFor God's sake don't kiU my son," rushed to the place where the men were gal struggling and fighting together on the ground, and attempted to pull one of the2nen off his son, and his wife -eized another of the men by the hair, and endeavoured to wold him. At this time the deceased, who cas a healthy mnan of 60 years of age, was according to some of the witdoesses knocked down, and fell Tith the back of his head on -tlat s; tacoig toothers, hewwas pushed sharpl back fronm the struggling men and fell. The deceased's wife said the prisoner Beggatsiooked him downv, while some of the 'witnesses said it waa the prisoner Rae who knocked him downa with a basket. Two surgeons named Elliot
tted that there wasa serious bruise on the left temple of the deceased by which the flesh was quite crushed, and under this bruise was found a quantity of clotted blood on the brain of the deceased, the pressure from which had caused hs death. Ths decemsed never spoke after he wvas knocked down, but became insensible, and died next day at4 -o'dlock. In the opinion of the surgeons no blow from a fist -could have caused such a bruise, nor a fall; it must have lbeen caused by a violent blow from some instrumentk or by a kick from a clog.
Bis LOnDSPur oarly in the case decided that as against the prisoner Higgins there was no evidence; on the case against the other prisoners being closed,
hr. Fos", submitted there was no evidence against any -one of them which was not contradicted by other evi-dence in the case, and there was clearly no commron Inurpose among them to attack the elder Higgins. The death -ws said to be caused by a blow fromn some instrument, or by a kick with a clog, of -which there was no evidence. The ossibility of its being caused by a blow from a fist or by a
w was negatived.
His LORDSHIP being of this opinion directed an acquittal, at the same time expressing a strong opinion that it was the
lqgraceful and riotous conduct of the prisoner Higgins which had created the disturbance and -violence which had led to his father's death.
William Jopson, a lad 18 years of age, 'was indicted for arson, in felonmously setting fire to a barn at Castle Sowerby, in the occupation of Edmund Wallers, on the 20th of -January last.
Mr. Davison prosecuted, and hr. Scott defended the - prisoner.
From the statement of the learned counsel, it appeared that -the prisoner had been engaged as a farm servant in the emn-loyinent of Mr. Waller, a farmer at Sowerby-row
na a fewv days before the fire which formed the subject of the indictment, the prisoner was observed by X lad, who was also a servant in the same house, to put somne lucifer matches and paper in his pocket, and upon an even. ing previous to the fire the prisoner, upon being sent to bed Ly his mistress, told the lad with whom he slept that it -should "be worse for them (meaning his master and mis-tress) hereafter." The fire took place between 7 and S -eclock on the evening of the 20th January, in a large barn -containing oats and hay, and ended in the destruction of -property to the value of 5001. The prisoner had been seen going out to the stable on the night in question, and upon
meing found fault with for not showing more activity and Zea1 in endeavouzing to extinguish the fire, he had said to two or three persons "Let it burn," or some words to that effect. A former fire had been discovered and extinguished on the 17th January. These facts having been proved by the testimony of various witnesses,
The learned JuDGE summed up, directing the jury that the facts proved bore very lightly on the prisoner, against whom suspicion had rested mainly from the expressions he had been heard to make use of.
The jurY Acquised the prisoner.
C1vIm COURT.-( Before Mir Jujtice CROMn TOS.)
MORLEY V. CLARK.
In this case Mr. S. Temple, Q.C., Mr. E. James, Q.C., and Mr. Crompton Hutton were for the plaintiff, and Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. Price for the defendant.
This action was brought to recover a sum of money which the plaintiff alleged he had paid as surety for the defendant apon a joint and several promissory note in November, 185L It appeared that tho defendant had married the niece of the plamitiff in 1884, and for a few years after their marriage the defendant was employed on the farm of Mr.
Penice, at Skinburness, and his wife kept a school there. l 'The plaintiff persuaded them to leave Skinburness, and to take a farm in Brackenthwaite, promising to give them money to stock it. A farm was accordingly taken, and the -Plaintiff was defendant's surety on the lease, which was for mine years. In consequence of the failure of a bank at Carlisle, where the plaintiff had some ready money, a sum of 2001. was borrowed for the purpose ot stocking the farm, and both the plaintiff and defendant signed a joint and several promissory note for th%t amount, and the plaintiff deposited some deeds also as a security. This took place in 1837, and upon the death of the payee in 184S another note of a similar description and for the same -amount had been given by the plaintiff and defendant to the representative of the former payee.
It appeared that the ayee of the second note died in .51, when the plaintif. partly with his own money and -partly by some money he borrowed, paid off the principal sum of 2001., the interest on which had all along been paid by the defendant.
'There was a great deal of conflicting evidence in the case as to statements which it was alleged the plaintiff had made, and which tended to show thab the 2001. was meant as a gift on his part to his niece. The plaintiff had never asked for the money from the defendant until September of last year, 'when it appeared he had married a young wife which it was suggested was the reason why what had been intended as a gift was suddenlv claimed a loan.
The trial lasted a considerable time and into the second day, when, after a moet careful summing up by the judge, the jury found a verdict for the defendant.

CROWVN COURT.-( Before Mr. Baron MLARiTN.)
William Graham, aged 27, was indicted for the wilful murder of Thomas Simpson, of Ainstable, on the 15th of 2Tovember last.
The prisoner is a decent-looking young man, a labourer, and was dressed in a fustian jacket, apparently kis working -dress.
hMr. Overend, Q.C., and the Hon. Mr. Liddell appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Monk and Mr. Leeming for the defence.
It appeared from the opening statement of the learned counsel for the prosecution, and from the evidence after. -wards produced, that the deceased man Thomas Simpson -was a gamekeeper employed by a gentleman named Featherstonaugb, who was lord of the manor of Nunnery-with. Ermithwaite, a manor on the banks of the river Eden, in 'the parish of Ainstable. The deceased was a married man, 26 years of age, and lived at a place called High-field. The deceased had been in Mr. Featherstonaugh's employ. mnent since the 26th of August last, and was a bold, athletic Voung man. He was at home with his wife about 9 o'clock on Saturday night, the 15th of November last, getting his tea, when he heard some shots fired over the water on some
roperty belonging to Sir George Musgrove. He immeisately got up and put on his greatcoat, put into his pocket a smaU single-barrelled pistol, took with him a roundheaded stick, and set off alone in the direction of the shots. He never returned alive. He had also in his pocket at the time a silver watch and some few shillings in money. Not returning that nieht, his wife went next morning, about 9 o'Clockc, to Staffield-hall, and informed the coachman there that her husband had been out aU night and had not come hone, and also that she had heard two shots some little time after he had left. A search was set on foot by the coachman, with assistance, in various directions, that day, but nothing was Been of the deceased. At the top of a gate, however, near a place called Crowdy Knowe, the greatcoat of the deceased was found. There had been a strong boar frost in the course of the night, which crusted over the grass, and nothing further was observed. On that Sunday uight information was sent to a constable named Pharaoh of the deceased being missing, and that his coat had been found as-described; and on the following morning a man named .fames Elliot and Pharoah renewed the search, and on coming to a place called Edeni Banks, where there is a rapid slope down to the river Eden, they fotmd
a pool of U;tod, some brains, and pieces of skull, and also saw traces of blood on the grass leading domva to the river, and appearances 4a if some heavy substance had been dragged -ver the grass to the river. On looking into the river, near a -rock, in three or four feet of water, something -white was observed, which on being moved with a stick tumed out to be the body of the deceased, without -cot, hat, or xvaistcoat, and with the shirt pulled over thie head andface, and fastened only by the wrists and neGk. T'isi place was about 300 yards fromn the spot where the pool of hlood d o adbeen observed, On examining the body it appeare as if -itbad been dragged by the
legs down to the rver ;through the hurze bushes, which had
ipuled the shirt over the head, for on the back were longitudinal scratches, which appeared to have been made
after death. T he deceased's -watch wrsfoum nd in his ocket,
sepped at half-past 12. He d-leSt his heuse abot t10

the pistol which he had taken out sittlt Wim.. The water of the river wans very clear, anid diligent seazch had been .madeinit without findingt~he pistol. The dew~ased's body wras removed to his house, and on examoinatiornthm,s lacerated wvonnds 'were found on thie scap, the skull was fract.ired and brolren and W5a literally smashed to pieces on the rieit side, and the brains wero ititckinag about the wound ini va.-ious plAces. There were also f&zr fractures extending acrosg ..he gkp] in isrious waLys. The face 'Was swolleni and discol-mur& frona-blows, 'which Mir. Gill, the ;a-geofl, wise 4%kay4ined

cion having alighted on the prisoner from some exproilons he had been heard to make use of, be and his brother. Hnry Graham were apprehended. On goin the prisoner'shouse. he was met ooming out. le thenmsewed ih in dicatons of fear, but said they would find ki,mother.bumning ' -gunstock under the oven. This was found to be coireGt; but this gunstock had nothing to do vwthbthis transaction, and she was destroying it from some object of her own. This was on the Monday after the murdbr. The prisoner and his relations had been engaged asssting in the search the day before. When charged with this offence,.the prisoner said he was drunk on Saturday night and -knew nothing about it, and had been at a neighbour's house, who wvould tell the officers so. It appeared that the prisoner had been at the house of a person named Stewart late on Saturday night, and that he then, from his voice and manner, appeared to be drunk. There were no marks of violence on the prisoner when tnken into custody. Between 4 and 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the murder the prisoner went to a village caled Ainstable, and purchased an ounce of gunpowder, a pound of. shot, and a pennyworth of percussion caps at the shop of a woman namned Watson, and he then went home to his fatbhe's house, which was in thevillage of.Lougdales. Onhis way he would have to pass through a place called Basco Dike, and there, according to the evidence of a man named Francis Boustead, a labourer, who was thrashing oats in a bain belopging to a Mr. Goulding, he went into this barn, and accosted Boustead with " Now, Frank, is thou at work 2" and he replied he was. He thenleanedagainBta "mew" ofstrawthe witness had been thrashing, and said he was going out to shoot that night He then stood up, and said, *I know where theirgame sit; I know every pool and track of the ground, and if their - keeper comesto me this night out goes the-'s brains But I will speak-once to bima; Iwill tel him tostand back, and if he stirs an inch towards me after I speak out goes the -'s brains. I neither fear heaven nor hell, God nor Devil; I will be in either heaven or hell before a month is over; I wiU never die with my shoes off. Now, mark my words, This night, this very night, I will be the -'a end." He then put his hand up to his breast and said, " I m the man that will do the deed thou knows all about it. There never shall be a - about Staffield-hall take me." He then put his band to his ueckand said, *' I don't care a d-if I be hun
up by the neck to-morrow." He then turned about and went straight off. This witness Eaid he did not see anything ailing him in drink. He had not told Simpson of this that Dight because he had somewhere else to go. He had not told his (Simpson's) wife of It next morning because he was tired. He had not told her in the afternoon because he had to go and see his mother, who was ill, and had never mentioned It till the 11th of December, after a reward of 100L had been offered for the apprehension of the murderer, though he swore he had mentioned it before he had heard of the reward. This witness's appearance was repulsive, and, on his cross-examination, he repeated word for word the statement over again. Between 6 and 7 o'clock of the night of the murder the prisoner went to Susan Hogarth's at the village of Langdales, and he then had a gun with him and was very tipsy. He stayedat that house, havingfallen asleep, till 10 eclock, when Susan Hogarth awoke him, and said to him, " WiUiam, you had better fgo home." He said " It was a very fine night he would fetch them down." She told him the man would be watching him. He said, "Let the- stand back." She said. You had much better go home." He &said, " Well, Susan, I will " and he then left and went to Stewar's house in Langdales. Stewart had gone to bed, leaving his house door unfastened, and the prisoner walked in. Stewart asked if he should getup and open his bedroom door for him;and the prisoner, whose voice he knew, answered, "No, thou need not, I am as drunk as blazes, and am going home." He then aspeared to have gone in the direction of Eden Banks where the murder took place. The prisoner and his brother were kept in prison till the 19th of December, when the prisoner b me seriously iL, so much so that Dr. Jackson, the medical man of the gaol, had fears that he would not recover, and this was told to Henry Gaham, his brother, who oxpressed an earnest desire to see him, and he was allowed to go into the same cel with him. After being there a short time with the ion
alone, the prisoner sent for the suparintendent of t g&ol, and said he wished to make a statement to him, and accordingly Mr. Robinson, the superintendent, went to him, and he then stated that, " Five weeks gone last night I went out to shoot on Eden Banks, and saw a man there, who told me to stand. I ran away, and after running about ten or a dozen yards I tumbled, and he came rp to me and got hold of me. We bad a scuffle. He tried to getthe gun from me. I cleared myself of him, andthen struck him with the small end of the gun two or three times. The third "bat" felled him, and then the gun broke. It was broken off behind the lock, and I then took the stock from the barrel and brayed him till he was dead, I then trailed him to the water, and put him in. My brothers Henry and Joseph are both clear and have nothing to do with it. I was dead drunk when the man came up to me. I thought him to be the gamekeeper of StafiMeld-hall. When I was runnng away he fired a pistol at me, but did nothit me." After this statement hadbeenmadeHenry Graham was liberated, ahd he then volunteered evidence against his brother, and stated that about 7 o'clock on the night of the murder the prisoner came home and wanted his gun, but his mother took it away and said she did not like his having the gun, and he then got down his father's gun, and took some powder and shot out of his pocket and put it in a flask, and went out of the house. That night he and his brother Joseph went to bed together, the prisoner being absent. About 7 o'clock on Sunday morning, when Henry Graham awoke, he felt something cold cnd wet, and found it to be his brother William's wet stocking, and that his brother William was in bed. His brother (the prisoner) then told him there was a gun at the bed head, and he wished him to take it down. On doing so Henry Grahamx found only the barrel, the stock being brokennear the lock. He examined it, andfound that it was his father's gun. The prisoner then whispered tohim to put it out of the wuy, and he accordingly took it away and put it in the stable loft. Next day the prisoner told him
e had baen out the night before and met the gamekeeper, who told him " to stand; he kenn'd him ;" that he fired a pistol at him and missed him; that the keeper came up to him and told him " he had a different man to take witt to what he had had before;"tbatthey thenhad a hand to hand struggle; that he (the prisoner) got the gun and struck the keeper until hethought he was dead. Bie then went awa.y, but missed his shot-belt and wvent back again and fuund it, and also found a pistol near the man's body. He then trailed the man away to the river Eden. He said he never had such a sweat in his life and that it might as easly have been his end as the keeper's. After this conversation, during which the prisoner wept sorely, the prisoner told him the gun must be put further out of the gate (way), and Henry Graham went to the place where he had hidden the barrel, and, having found it, put the barrel into the thatch of the cottage, and also hid the stock in a field called Tom Moses's field, in a wet place. The police made a search in the places indicated, and found both the barrel and the gunstook. The trigger-guard was marked with blood. There were also marks of blood on the gunstock, and two little pieces of wood were missn
from it, and on comparing the two little pieces of wood found near the pool of blood on Eden Banks with the gunstock they fitted it exactly. The gun thus found was the prisoner's father's gun. The barrel was found to be bent and twisted, and was loaded. The prisoner also stated that he had thrown the pistol into the Eden; but, although every possible search had been made for it, it had not been found. To the prisoner it was of the greatest importance that if found, it should be discovered to have been discharged, oecause, although the gamekeeper had a right to apprehend him, ho had no right to fire a pistol at him. The learned counsel called on the jury to tale the prisoner's statement as an admission against himself so far as it implcated him, but not to give weight to it, except where corroborated, where it went to excuse him.
The various witnesses were then called to prove these facts. A good deal of difficulty was experienced in showing Mr. Featherstonaugh to be lord of the manor,'having a right to appoint tho deceased as his gamekeeper, and various old deeds ard admittances at the Manor Court were tendered in evidence, from which it appeared that the freehold of the lands in question, formerly in the Featherstonaugh family, had passed into the family of the Aglionbys, but it was not shown that the manorial rights had so passed, and it wvas submitted that the deceased was appointed rightly by the lord of the manor, and had authority to
ppeon the prisonier when trespassing on the mianor in pursuit of game. The wife of the decesmed manwasprovedl to have been confined only a few days ago, and being unable to travel her deposition was put in and read, explaining the time at which her husband left his cottage on the nighb of the murder, and his dress, and her seeing nothing more of him till his dead body was brought home on the following Monday. At this point thelearned counsel for the prosecution said he thought it right to state a fact which no doubt the learned counsel for the prisoner would have extracted from the widow of the deceased on cross-examination had she been examined that day, that the deceased, presiously to his employment by MIr. Featherstorhaugh as gamekeeper
had been a poacher, and in a serious con£ot with Lordl Lonsdale's keepers had firedashotwhich had eventually led to the death of one of the keepers. H[o had been tried for this and had escaped.
The learned counsel for the prisoner, in his address to the
jury, contended on the evidence that the offence of the prisoner amounted only to manslaughter in point of law, relying on the admissions put in evidence against the prisoner as true statements of the circumstances as they had occurred. Xhe fact mentioned by the learned counsel for the prosecution bore out the statement of the prisoner regarding the deceased, that he had fired a pistol at him, as that fact showed that the deceased was a man who did not shrink from violent personal encounter, and on a former occasion, had not hesitated to use firearms against those with -whom he was in conflict, It would appear that the deceased had himself taken o£f his greatcoat and thrown' it over the gate, in order to be moro free for the conflict. The absence of bruises was accounted for by the deceased having got hold of the prisoner's gun, and the violent struggle of these powerful men had evidently been for possession of the gun. Possibly, the missing part of the deceased's dress had been taken possession of by some of the crowd of curious persons who had visited the spot. The learned counsel contended that, even supposing the deceased had authority, as ganmekeeper to apprehend the prisoner, he had no anthority to fire a pistol at him; and if in any subsequent encounter between them the priaoner, whose life had been 6o imperilled, had in defending himself inflicted death upon the keeper, the law, in its mercy, did not view a death so inflicted in hot bloed as murder, but as manslaughter. He contended that the statement of the witness Boustead wva wholly unworthy of credit,' aud denounced it as a fabrication for the purpose of securing the 1004 reward which. had .beea offered by the Government. The prisoner had already fred' greatly from the terrible reezsliection of that night, an.%'.hen he had made the state.meritVi~the prIso at' Penrith-he was almost aideath's door; and, whatever thesi vc6rDO,then mental sufferingle hait . nndergoue would ha'&e tl,-ft'eff t of shortiing his days'

He had evidently.gone oxttatbtlnghtiforibe pur. pose of abooting game, and, weetinig.ith the keeper , hae
clled to hm tostand, and as he hAdnotdone so, bt had run away, the keeper had fired after him; Atdontlaentisoner tumbling the keeper had closed upon hnim, and End attempted to take the gun from his, and a str 'I had then ensued, which had revulted as the prisoner ha. staed. If thejury believed tho evidence of the witnegs aoustead, the przioner. had gone out that night with a de&dlype of killing the keeper; andif hedid sogo out, thatwouldbe marder. But upon thzat he thought they would°do wel to considerz how far they could place reliasce on the statement of a man, got up evidently by heart as it. were, and, as It would seem, with the object of securing the offered reward. If Ihey did not rely upon Boustea`s evidence, then r e maust tell them thA t ta crimie, in point or law, in hi, opinion, amounted only to manslaughter. 3w n i
The jury, after a short consultation, viithout levn' 'h
box, found the prisoner 'Guiify of manslaughter.4
tThe ver,dict was receivedwith loud clappging of hanads by
His LORD , in passing sentence, said, that the'e of which the prisoner had been found guilty was one which varied greatly in Its magnitude. In some cases it was a very light offence; in others the line of distinction between it and murder was exceedingly slight. In this case the crime committed by the prisoner was, he must sa Ter
little short of murder. No doubt whatever hie a ley the deceased in a barbarons maanner, and had made his wife a widow with a child yet vuborn. He, however, total7 disbeheved the statement of Boustead, which was em dently made in the hope of scuring the offerd reward. The punishment in this caie o usf necessarily be a very severe one, and the sentence of the Court was that the prisoner be transportedforlife,t
This case concluded the criminal business of the assizes.

MORTON V. PORT ARMsLH DOOK AND RAILWAXY
COXMIPANl. -
In this case Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. lUdall were for the plaintiff; Mr. S. Temple, tQC., and Mr. P. Thompson were for the efen dants.
The action was brought against the coompany for not keeping a cut or drain, which they bad been directed to make uncler an act of ParBament in 1819, in order to take awvay the water from the lands adjoining the canal of the, company, in a clcan and sufficient state for that purpose.
It appeared that the plaintiff wss possessed of a field'at' Bowstead-hiDl, near the river den, and- the company had made a canal from Carlisle to the Solway Frith, which passed through the marsh land adjoining the plaintiff's propey. A duty was imposed on the company by the Act of Parliament to keep any drains or CutS made by them in a clean state, so that the water shouldnot stagnate or be thrown back on the adioining lands.
A great body of evidence was given for the plaintiff to show the improper state in which the company had kept their drain, the consequence of which was, as the plaintiff alleged, the water was sent beck on the plaintiff's Peld, and successive crops in several years were injured.
On the other hand, the defendants called witnesses to show that the company employed persons once every year to clean out the accumulation of aluvial deposit, and they contended that the damage to the plaintiff bad not boen caused by any negligence on their part.
The trial lssted the whole day, and, after the JuiDGE had summed up the evidence, the jury found a verdict for the defendants.

Middlesex Society For The Reformation And
MIDDLESEX SOCITY FOB THE REFORMIATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF DISCHARGZD CRIJdfLS.-Yesterday afternoon the first annual meeting of the friends of this society took place in the dining-room of the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell. The Mfarquis of Salisbury took the chair, and there were also present Lord R. Grosvenor, M.P., fr. Pownall, Colonel Elsey, Mr. falswel, Mr. Gurney Hoare, Mr. Antrobus, Mr. Freer, &ac. The noble Chairman having briefly opened the proceedings, and referred to the vast and growing importance of a regular system of reformatory in,
.tituti.na, the secretary read the -report. After detailizig the names of the principal donors to the society, it went-on to say that the chaplain of the Coldbath-fields House of Correction found the greatest difficultyin providing, out of an adult male prison population of 1,500, for ttose who might be willng to seek a new character through the medium of voluntary seclusion in a reformatory. There was a very smaU number of such institutions open to their adult prisoners, and the funds of those institutions were quite inadequate to carry out the benevolent views of their pro. nioters, though it was hoped that the establishment of the Middlesex Eociety would tend to extend and aid their efforts. In the course of the year 26 cases were received from the Coldbath-fields Prison into the London Reformatory, 20 into the North-Western, and 12 into the Metropolitan, in addition to which U seamen were admitted into the Destitute Sailors' Rome, and five general eases were provided for in other institutions. These returns showedan increase in the number provided for, though it was but a weak criterion of what the society could accomplish with increased resources. It fact, it was the opinion of the chaplains of the gaols that if the reformatories were put into condition to receive all they were intended to accommodate Coldbath-fields alone would supply all their inmates. The report then went on to give many illustrations of the value of a helping hand at that most critical time in a criminal's career, when the law had exacted its full penalty, and the strlgle for life commenced anew with a blemished character. The total receipts of the secicty from alU sources amounted to 57S1. las., and the expenditure fell short of that sum by 4021 Us. 3d., whiclt rermained as a balanice, and of which 3001. was invested at interest. On the 'notion of Loxd R. Grosvenor, seconded by tnr. PownalL the report was received and adopted. Other resolutions were also- passed awm. on , pledging the sub. scribers to continue and extend theirxertions in favour of the reformatorY system, esPecimilly as applicable to ja*enile criminals. Some usual rouatine' businesa, was then gone through, and the proceedingF terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman.

Sir,-From a statement in 2ne icms of the 17th inst. your readers are already aware that the inhabitants of Finland are at present sufferinlg fiom a severe famine, so that many of them are obliged to mix their bread with bark from the sitrees. Subscriptions in aid of tho sufferinghave been inadeinStPetersburg, Fi5nlad, and Sweden, but, as the want is great, these will, no doubt prove inseifcient.
In consequence of Finland havng during the late war suffered a great deal from the English fleet in the Baltic, an impression of bitter feeling has been left upon the minds of many of the Finlanders against the English. There is now, however, an excellent opportunity for a benevolent English public to make the Fins forget their sufferings during the war, and at the same time exercise an act of Christian chanity, if some contributions from this country were sent to Finland to bhu bread ror those -who are starving.
Several inq ies having been made by persons wishin
to give somet towards this object, it would be an act of great kindness and benevolence if you would consent to receive contributions of this kind.
lZot being a Fin myself, I have no other motive for writing these lines than sympathy for the snfferings of a noble people whose Ii toy hias been connected with that of Sxee e ore than 600 years. This, I hope, will lbe an excuse for my boldness in addressing you on tbe subject.
_I am, Sir, your most obedient servant.

CouRT OF COMMoN Couwcan.-Yesterday a Court of Common Council was held, at which various subjects were brought under consideration. In answer to a question, Mr. Deputy Bower said the architect, Mr. Banning, had laid before the Improvement Committee a plan for coverin a portion of the vacant ground in St. Paul's Churchyarl A letter was read from the MfetropoliHtan Board of Works respecting the opening of Southwark-bridge free of toll, and was referred to the Bridge-House Estates Committee.
.rport from tbe City Lands Committee, recommending improverments at the Sessions House, Old Bailey, was adopted and it was referred back to the committee to carry it into execution, in conjunction with the Court of Aldermen. A report respecting the drawback on coals was read and adopted. One of the suggestions of the report is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall be consulted in order to aseertain his views respecting am amendment of the Act relating to the subject. A depatation from the coal whippers of the port of London presented a petition praying theConrtto institute an inquiry into their present deplorable condition and to devise a remedy for it. The petition was referred to the Coal and Corn and linance Committee. Mr. Anderton gave notice of a motion, the object of whieh is to ascertain the value of several -vacant sites of land within the city of London, which might be purchased for the erection of baths and washhouses. The Court voted 105o. towards the erection of a new school-house in Golden-lane and 52J. 1Oa. towards the si ragged schools in St. George the Martyr, Southwark.
31B=oroiTA BoARD oF WoRscs.-At the weekly meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works yesterday, Mr. J. Thwaites in the chair, a deputation from the CamberwelU vestry attended for the purpose of objecting to any part of the 200,0001. borrowed by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers being charged upon that parish. Mr. Bodkin appeared in support of the objection, and, after some discussion, a motion was submitted by Mr. Turner, that the Board was notatlibertytocomplywiththe report of the deputation. To this proposal an amendment was submitted to the effect that the decision of the Board should be postponed until the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor General should be taken s to whether the Board bad the power to adopt the prayer of the memorial. The amendment was rejected by 27 to 8, and the original motion was carried. The nexct matter on thepaper was further to consider the finaucial statement to assess moneys on the several parts of the metropolis for defraying the expenses of the Board in the execution of the Metropolis Local Mlanagement Act, and direct the issuing precepts for obtaining payment of the sums assessed. Obctions wvere made to the discussion of the subject at that time, and ultimately it was agreed that the consideration of the financial statement should be postponed till Tuesday nc,xt.
WxSTrrsrm Bss3rD.-On Wednesday evening a meeting of the inhabitants of Westminster-road and its vicinity was held at the Vestry.haDl, Kennington, upon the subject of Westminster-bridge, Mr. C. Hinton in the chair. Mr. Wilkinson moved, and Mr. Archbutt seconded, a resolution to the effect that the meetingviewed with the greatest apprehension any removal of Westminster-bridge from its present site-, proceeding which, in their opinion, would cause the ruin of a large number of occupiers of houses in the borough of Lambeth, without conferrin$ the slightest advantage upon the public. Mr. W. Wilhams, who took this view of the subject, expressed his surprise that Sif B. Hall should have mnade any objection to the retention-of the present site of the bridge after it had been approved by Sir t,. Barry and Mr. Page., Several rate-payers expre6sed theit dissatisfaction at the conduct of Sir B. ElalL The r¢soluiion was carried nimonely, and it was arranged that in addition to a petition to Parliament a representation of their wipalihoaId be >*,de SO Lord Palsueraton,

HARROW SCHOOL CHAPEL.-The Memorial aisle.
HARROW SCHOOL CHAPEL.-The Memorial aiWle. of the new school chapol at Harrow is gradualy rising, and promises to realize all that was hoped by its most sanigmne promoters. Much regret is feltat the failure of the unds to provde for the spireo which was an important. feature of 3fr. Scott's design, and which, if done at all, should he done while the other works aro in wpzgress. A donation of 1001. has been offered for this gpeca purpose, provided that the remaining 4001. required to build the spip be subscribod before the lst of AMay.
HARILOW SCHOOL.-Lord Ebrington has recently presented to Harrow School seven massive silver cup in cases linedI with velvet and satin, to he held by the champion for the timsebelving fior &thefollbown gaesd byntha hovwling, fielvding, and rackets. eTphneyar alli eg,ve with the arms ef the school, anld hear the following inscription:-" Champion Cup, presented by Viscount Ebrington.l-.
K cs's COLLEGE HosrrTAL.-The annualmeeting of the governors was held en Thursday. The report;. of the committee stated that the inrease In the numberof patients over those of last year has been 2,005 To meet the more premsing demands for admittance thbee additional wards have been opened, under the charge of ]fr. Bowman and Dr. Arthur Farre. There is a grt increase of persons applying for relief in the out-patient. department, and nearly oO persons receive advice ant! medicines daily. The income of the year 1856 wa& 5,5871. &g. lid., and the expenditure 7,858C. 9d. ld. The;
only assets consisted of 2,21U1. 8s. lOd. in Cousol, and 161, in 3 per Cent. Reduced. The liabilities of the Instea amount to nearly ZOOOL, so that the charity isentirel dependent upon the current donations of the publie for su
port. The great feature in the hospital adninistration during the past year has been an effort in conneon tl the Training Institution for Nurses at St. John's-house Westminster, to introduce a new andmpoesyt o
nursing intohospitals. This effort, which the comstee. describe as having been attended with the hapest resul
came into operation on the 31st of Marchlat. I s Florence' Nightingale has been among the visitors who have observed with interest the success of this important experiment, and. after spending some hours in the hospital, expressed her.;
self much pleased with the cleanly, cheerful, and homelikeappearan~ce of the wards. The dilapidated Is'tate of theoldhospital, which was once the worehouse of St. Clement, Danes, obliges the committee seriously to consider the necessity' of completinig the new building, and they propose tG brnmg this suLbject forward at an early day on the grounds. of its great public utilty, the urgcut neeld of the siec poor. and the impossibility of carryingon tbe work at the hospit
in the present wornout buildin_s. Whie preparing theitreport the committee learned with deep regret the death of their valued president, the Earl of Ellesmere, who had always proved himself a discriminating and generous frienad to the charity, and who withinthe last few days of his useful and honoured life, and in a tine of the hospital's great need, bad sent them a benefaction of 2001.-an affectionate mark of sympathy with sickness and suffering from one who hat!
himse suffered much. At the meeting the Rev. Dr. JelE stated that he had, at the request of the committee, waited upon his R,yal Highness thp Duke of Cambridge whoexpressed the warmest interestin the institution, ant eon-
seutod in the kindest 3manner to accept the vacant office oE president, and thereupon his Royal Highness was by acclamation of the meeting elected president in the room of the late Earl of Ullesmere.
TnE ENGLISa AND FRENCH mN GREiEc.-A letter from the Pirrous of February 18, says: -" OnMonday,
16th, a grand review of the French and English troop, to-
gother was passed by Admiral Bouet-Willaunme to take
eave of the armies previously to their-evacuation of Greec. The admiral remains in the Levant with his naval division. It was a beautiful winter's day, and the dry state of the ground was very favourable for manceuvres. The reoiments were drawn up in battle array along the Athens road. The platcau on which the leading columns took up their
poitions commands a view of the entire plain of Attica, bounded on the right by Phalera-bay, and in the far distance and on the left by the chain of the Hymettua mountains, the summits of which were crowned with
snow. In front of Hymettus was seen standing out. in bold relief the Acropolis rock, the ancient ctadel,
which contains the Parthenon, and on the sides ot which Is buUt modem Athens-the furthermost houses being half hidden in the old olive grove, sacred to Minerva. While contemplating these glories of pastages the French and English troops could at the same time

as which the columns extended, were cleared and finishedE
by the army of occuption. At noon Admiral Bouet-Willaumer-and Colonel Cmapbell, accompanied by their stafi
arrived on the ground. After having ridden along the rinks of the troops of the two nations, the French Admiral addressed the English as follows *-
