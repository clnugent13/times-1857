THE LUW OF LIBEL.
Lord CAMPBELL said, he would wiUingly postpone his motion in favour of the important discussion on hostilities with China, but he should have no other opportunity for sometimo,_as he must leave London for his circuit on Monday morning. The subject was one of great inaportance, involving the liberty of the pre33 and the protection of private character; but he shoald not detain their lordships nLany minutes, as he did not anticipate any resistance to his proposition. Ife did not propose any pal ticular measure, but only caUed upon their lordships to agree that this was a fit subject for inquiry. They were, no doubt, aware that a case had lately come before the Court of Queen's Bench, involving an important question whether a true account of the proceedings of what was eaUed a public meeting could be justified, although it might reflect upon the character of an individual. The Court of Queen's Bench unanimously decided that there was no such privilege. That decision had been severely critioized, and it had been said that the Court should have decided that every account of proceedings at a public meeting was privileged, however much it might refleet upon in4duals, and that it was sufficient to give a remedy against 'te speaker of the calumny uttered at such meeting, while the journalist, who was the means of circulating it throughout the world, should be allowed to eseape with impunity. That doctrine was said to be founded upon the Earl of Northampton's case, reported by Lord Coke. Their lordships wrere pretty weU aware that Lord Coke was not infallible, and in a recent memorable instance they bad decided against his authority, although very high. But that supposed authority was a mere extrajudicial dictum of some judges sitting in the Star Chamber, which had nothing to do with expressing any such opinion as is supposed, as it referred only to oral slander, and simply amounted to saying that if a man repeated 0a verbal accusation againt another, and at the same time mentioned his authority, he was not liable to an action. Bat even that decision had been overturned in a luminous judgment pronouneed by the noble and learned lord on the cross bench (Lord Wensleydale) in the case of " Macpherson v. Daniel," in which case he and the other judges who concurred with him laid down a limitation in regard to the dictum in the Earl of Northampton's ease that the repetition of oral slanders could only be justifaed upon proper occasions. It could not be supposed that such slander might be published in aU the journals and spread abroad throughout the world maliciously and wantonly; such a doctrine would be most alarming. In the first place, what were public meetings? Mr. Ernest Jones's meetings were public meetings, and could it be said that all that might be uttered at such meetngs could be lawfully published ? If such a doctrine was laid down sedition would pass very lightly, and there would be no safety for private character, for nothing would be easier than for a man to get up a public meeting in order to calumniate his neighbour, and to fly the country when his object was attained and his slander propagated throughout the world by means of the newspapers. To lay down a rule that everything spoken at a public meeting might be legally published was not to be thought of. But there was another point worthy of consideration-whether the privilege ought not to be extended to journalists, who wrer really and sincerely employed'in the public service, and doing that which was for the benefit of the community. With respect to proevedings in Parliament the country would not in the present day be satisfied if those proceedings were not permitted to be published, and, indeed, neither would the members of that or of the other House. As the law now stood there was no protection to journalists who gave fair and faithful reports of the debates. Upon that subject they had the high authority of Lord Denman, who, when examined before a committee in 1843, said, ' I canmot help entertaining a strong opinion that no faithful report of the debates should expose the publisher to any action at law or criminal proceeding. As the law now stands the fairness of the report is nothing like a justification, but I am strongly of opinion that&it ought to be." Upon that authority he (Lord Campbell), in the Bil which he had the honour of bringing in, introduced a clause giving that privilege, but, unfortunately, it was not adopted by Parliament-a circumstance which had been regretted by many. He therefore submitted to the House whether the time had not come when with perfect safety the privilege might be extended to faithful reports of proceedings in Parlianent. Surely, upon the same principle that faithful reports of proceedings in courts of justice were privileged faithful reports of the debates in Parliament might be permitted, it being in each instance for the public benefit that such reports should be published. Whether it might be possible to go further was a fair matter of inquiry. The subject was fuU of difficulty, and he would not venture to propose any Bill without having the assistance of a select committee. Although it would be too much to say that the privilege should be extknded to reports of all public assemblies, yet there were other bodies besides Parliament in whose proceedings the public took interest-such as convocation, for instance. It might not be very likely that the members of convocation would use slanderous expressions, yet he had heard some right rev. prelates in that House use very strong terms, and it might be that the privilege should be extended to reports of proceedings in convocation. The privilege might also be extended to reports of proceedings of county meetings and town-councils in boroughs. It would be unsafe to extend the privilege without some limitation, but it might be given to reports which were for the public good, leaving that point for a jury to decide. The course of appointing a select committee was that which was adopted in 1843, and he hoped the same course would be agreed to unon the present occasion. The noble lord concluded by mo~ing for a select committee to inquire whether the privilege now enjoyed by reports of law proceedings might not be safely and properly extended to proceedings in other bodies.
Lord WENSLEYDALE was understood to express his acquiescence in the statements of the noble and learned lord as to the existing law. It was not lawful to repeat a slander which another person had uttered.
The motion was then agreed to.
THE WAR WITH CHINA.
ADJOURNED DEBATE.
The order of the day having been read for resuming the adjourned debate on the resoluttions proposed on Tuesday evening by the Earl of Derby, condemnatory of the recent hostilities entered into against the Chinese by the British authorities at Canton,
The Earl of CARNARVON said, in rising to resume the adjourned debate, the able speeches they had heard the other night had so thoroughly exhausted the subject that he felt it almost impossible to throw any fresh light upon it. At the same time, however, he thought it would be -well worth while that he should briefly recaU to their lordships' recollection the main facts of the case under consideration, that he should restate some of the principal arguments which had b3en urged in defence of the motion of his noble friend, and that he should inquire Into the validity of the answers given to those arguments by noble and learned lords on the opposite side of the House The members of the Government who spoke the other evening dwelt vesy much on the Cbinese character. They adverted to the ignorance which prevailed among the Chinese of English habits and English laws and customs. They dwelt on the difficulty of dealing with the Chinese by any application of the principles of international law; aud a noble earl, not then in his place (the Earl of Clarendon) used in reference to that point an expression which he (the Earl of Carnarvon), for one, heard with the deepest regret. The noble earl talked of the difficulty of dealing with the Chinese in any other way than by making them sensible of the law of force. (Hear, hear.) But the prime axgument which their lordships had to consider, and on which the whole ease turned, had been left entirely untouched by noble lords oppcsite. That was the point whether the lorcha was an Eng,lish or a Chinese vessel. That was the real question at issue, because if it could be shown, as he submitted it had been and could be shown, that the lorcha was a Chinese and not an English vessei then he said that all the arguments advanced in opposition to the motion, based as they wereon the contrary assumption, fell at once to the ground. Was the lorcha, then, an English or a Chinese vessel? Let their lordships turn to the words
or their own Attorney-General at Hongkong. Tbat gentlen,an said,-
" The colony of Hongkong, -with a Chinese population exceeding at t e present time 60,000, bardly contains 10 Chinese who can legally be called British subjects (hear, hear), for it has not been deemed advisable to naturalize the Chinese here, and the recent Eettlement of the colony prevente the possibility of their having become subjects by birth. The great proportion of the respectable part of this l opulation have, however, constituted themselves bondftde British subjects by becoming Crown tenants of leaseholds for long terms of years (a tenure of wbich an alien is incapable), and by permanent settlcment have evinced the clearest intention of perfecting themselves in the persons of their descendants British suibjects 8ecundu?a leges as well as de fccto.
He (the Earl *& Carnarvon) contended, then, upon the Etatement of It ttorney-General for Hongkong, that the population there could in no sense be designated Englsh *ubjects. (Hear, hear.) What were they then? The answer was a simple one. He (the Earl of Carnarvon) believed that the Chinese residents at Hongkong had a double capacity-they served two masters; they were English on Rnglish territory, and Chinese on Chinese territory. (Hear, hear,) I1 would i3 become him to place himself on a ques-
tion of law in contradiction to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack; but, as he could not do that, he trusted he n igh.t be pFrmitted to quote the opinions- of-others to-which-
he thought the noble and learned lord himself wotld be disposed to defer. The noble and learned lord in the course of his address to the House on Taesday night said, "If the British Government authorizes a ship to go into a foreign
port and carry the British flag, as between us and the I foreign country, this is oertibily a British ship." Now, he (the Earl of Carnavon) could not pretend to set up his authority against the noble and learned lord upon inch a point; but the noble and learned lord was at variance in the matter, as far as he (the Earl of Carnarvon) could learn, with some of the most distinguished jurists who had Ever attempted to define the principles of international law. For example, it had been laid down by Blackstone:-
' "NaEional allegiance is such as is due from all men born Vwithin the King's dominions immediately upon their birth.
National allegiance is therefore a debt of gratitude which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or altered by any change of time, place, or circumstance, nor anything but the united concurrence of the Legislature-that is, of course, not the Legislature of the adopting State, but the Legislature of the State where the individnal is born. (Hear, hear.) An E3nglishman who removes to Prance or to China owes the same allegiance to the Kin of E:ngland there as he did at home, and 20 years hence as well as now."
Hear, hear.) Again, Chancellor Kent, the great American jurist, stated:
"A citizen could not divest himself of his alleiance, except under the sanction of a law of the United States."
But he would rest his case entirely on the judgment pronounced in this matter by Her Majesty's Government themselves. A few weeks ago a letter was written by Mr. Waddington, as representing Sir George Grey, on the subject of naturalization, from which he (the Earl of Carnarvon) would read an extract. Mr. Waddington said -
"As there is reason to believe that some misconception prevails as to the extent of the privileges conferred by a cbrtifiate of naturalizaton, I am directed by Secretary Sir George Grey to explain to you that no certificate or other act of naturrlization granted by the Britieh Government to an alien places him beyond the lawful power and control of his native country, unless he has received from the Government of such country a certificate of denationalization, or been released from his original obligations as a subject or Citizen in some other legal way."
Hear. ) Now, he would ask, had there been any such denaturalization in this ease? He contended that there had not been one single vestige of ssent or concurrence by the Chinese Government with the powers which were claimed under the ordinance of the HongkongLegislature. (Hear, hear.) On the contrary, there was a distinct repudiation on their part by the Commissioner Yeh as to the existence of any such powers. (Hear, hear.) .Zemo potest patriam exrere had long been a recognized maxim of our law; but with what consistency was it that, after adhering rigidly to that rule in our dealings with other countries, we refused to aoknowledge its application when it was pressed against ourselves? (Hear, hear.) He believed the law was that a Chineae resident in English territory was an English subject in his relations with every country except one, that one being the country in which he was born. But of his allegiance to China neither his own act, nor the act of the local Legislature, nor even the act of the Imperiat Parlfament of England, could divest him without the express concurrence of his native country. (Hear, hear.) This ordinance could not possibly affect the Chinese, who had never given their assent to it. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack had argued the other night that every lorcha with a colonial register was a British ship, and that the Chinese, therefore, were acting in contravention of the treaty in boarding the Arrow and in making this seizure. There was, however, nothing in the 17th article of the treaty which in any way defined what constituted an English ship. (Hear.) That article said that any lorcha might, under certain conditions, have a register, but it did not say that every lorcha which had a register was therefore a British ship. (Hear, hear.) It was perfectly apparent that at least one-third of the trafflic which went out of the port of Canton was not Englis", but foreign-Duteb, French, or American. What he complained of, ther, was that we framed a treaty with a particular nation, giving to ourselves exceptional advantages in total opposition to the whole course of international law, and then extended those privleges, applicd in the first instance to Englishmen, to every nation in the world. (Hear, hear.) Could any arrangement be more unjust? (Hlear.) As the Government had identified themselves so closely with the acts of the consul, their lordshipe would do well to remember that, only one year since, the present Ministry formally renounced the right of privateering, and yet it was reserved for the same Ministry (with what consistency he did not pretend to say) to assert a right which he honestly believed was ten times more unjust and more oppressive. The doctrine to which he had just alluded was utterly unknown to international law, and utterly subversive of any principles recognized in the intercourse of nations. The argument might be summed up thus :-The colonial ordinance was first a contravention of international law; it was invalid from ita own irregularity and from the numerous flaws it contained; and by reason of this international law no Chinese residents in Hongkong could be released from the duties which they owed to their nativel country or from the control of the Chinese authorities without a certificate of denationalization. As it was with a man, so it was with his property, and therefore no Chinese ship could, by virtue of a British register, be released from the control of the Chinese authorities, unless they concurred in that release. As a matter of fact they had not so concurred, and therefore it followed as a necessary conclusion that a lorcha owned by Chinese and manned by Chinese was not in any way exempt from the authority of Chinese officials. (Hear, hear.) But he might grant every single statement relating to that part of the question which had been brought forward by the Government. He might go so far as to say that if he were to grant three-fourths of every argument urged by the Government the one-fourth which remained unanswered by them would be amply sumficient to insure a strong censure of Sir John Bowring's acts on thepart of this House. (Hlear.) The more the powers granted under the colonial register were examined the more rigidly scrupulons, every one must feel, ougbt the British authorities to have been in dealing with this question with the greatest legality and accuracy. But the register was, after all, a mere fiction and imposture. (Hear.) Sir J. Bowring's own words-his, in every sense of the word, double declarations on this subject-were its strongest condemnation. Let their lordships place in parallel columns these two statements and seo whether they did not ir volve the grossest contradiction. Sir J. Bowring wrote to Consul Parkes that the Arrow bad no right to hoist the British flag, and that the license expired on the 27th of Sep. tember, from which date she had not been entitled to British protection. On the other hand he wrote to Commissioner Yeh-" Whatever representations have been made to your Excellency, there is no doubt that the lorcha Arrow
.wfullybore the British flag under a register granted to her." This shield certainly had two sides to it (hear); and no man could read this declration without feeling that there was a falseness and a'perfidy about this transaction which could not be too strongly characterized. (Hear.) No member of Her Majdests Government who had yet spoken had for one moment dwelt upon, glanced, or hinted at this fact, so conscious did they appear of the wealmess of their case in this particular. For his part, he could not understand bY what sophistry Sir John Bowring reconciled hese conflicting statements with his feelings as a gentleman, his position as the representative of the Sovereign, and, above all, with that natioial honour of which he so often talked, but which upon this occasion he certainly seemed only to have insulted. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl opposite, the Foreign Secretary, had dwelt much the other night uuon the importance of passing no hasty condemnation upoi our officias in a distant country. No one could concur in this more heartily than be (the Earl of Carnarvon) did. He felt keenly the cruel iniustice of censuring upon light grounds those who in a distant country, surrounded by difflculties v hich could hardly be appreciated here, were doing their best to perform their duties; but were the Government at home tothrowtheir wpit alike overthose who acted rightly and wrongly? Were they to sanction acts of officials who by their own acknowledgment, had stated what they themselives c_onfessed to be almost a lie? It was very well for us to condemn the founders of our great Indian empire, but scarcely any of their acts were more treacherous thani those disclosed in the course of this case. The noble earl opposite (the Earl of Clarendon) dwelt upon the long senes o insults which had been heaped by the Chinese upon the British flag, and urged strongly that
ese at last warranted a recourse to arms. Now, what was the insult assumed to have been offered by this seizure of the crew of the Arrow? Noble lords opposite had argued that a decided animus had been shown on the part of the Chinese in hauling down the British flag. In the first place, however, it should be remembered that they were assuming that the flag was hoisted. (Hear, bear.) In the next place, it was stated that the Chinese officials, after rowing away in their boats, allowed the two sailors left on board to hoist the flag again, and this certainly did not show the existence of any a'imus, but rather the reverse. He would ask, however-and on this point he had received as yet no enlightenment -what was the real object for which we were at present at war ?
If a war was founded upon any pretence to moralityit must have an object. Now, on perusing these Papers e fond four distinct admissions made on ths subject. Oi the 8th of October, the day upon which the seizure of the lorcha took lce, Consul Parkes demanded the public return of the 12 men seized. Four days afterwards he made a further demand, and asked for the public return of the crew plus an apology, flus an assurance for the future, coupling this demand with the threat that unless redress were afforded within 48 hours he should have recourse to active measures. Considering this was the second letter contained in the correspondence, this was surely rather early to talk of active measures. (Hear.) The demand, however, was enforced by the seizure of a junk, by breaching the walls, by bl*wing up the gates, by firing upon the Commissione7s residence, and by two conflagrations of the toown. All this was undertaken on the grounds of the lorcha alone, and becau4eof the refusal to make repartion in regard to it. Aild what followed next? The Chinese scarcely returned a single shot, hut, on the contrary, returned the 12 men and made an apology, wbich he believed might have been accepted without discredit. There was one fact which was very significant and worthy of their lordships! attention, and that was, that'it was after the return of these men that the fire was opened upon the town. It was said that the reparationwas not sufficient, and then came a fresh demand. Sir J. Bowring wrote to Mfr. Parkev telling him to wait for the development of events, and then came the demand for means of free communication between the IropelaI Commissioner and Her Majesty's officers. But that was not all; for then came another demand, which he had xo,heitation in characterizing as the most preposterous he had ever heard, which was that free means of communicatio. shoula be afforded between the representatives of all Thr~gnta~s ad te Cinee athoitis.Well, what did S5ZJ.owrig the say He sid, Poorbenighted creature, hw cn tey e s blnd o teirown interests?
Bowring assumed a somewhat milder tone, 'which iresistibly reminded him of the scene in Shakespeare in which Richard
L. wooed the Lady Anne:-
" Was ever woman in such humour wooed? " Was ever woman in such humour won?
"What I I who killed her husband and his father, "To take her in her beais's extremest hate,
With curses in her mon th, tears in her eyes, ; The blecdiMg witness of her hatred by,
"With God, my conscience} and these barsagisme
( t"Hear, hear," ainst me.
* * * ~~~~ * aud~~laughter.)
"And yet I do mistake my person all the while - "Upon my life I find-although she cannot"Myself to be a marvellous proper person."
(Loud laughter.) Now, he could only say that, if Richard II,. was an improper person on the throne of England, Sir J. Bowring appeared to him an equaUy improper person to represent England at Hongkong. The clAim of free communication had been deliberately waived by Sir G. Bonham as being immaterial to British interests, and the successive Foreign Secretaries had adopted in that respect the policy of Sir G. Bonham, and yet that claim was again advanced by SirJ. Bow!ing, and he deeply regretted to find that the Government were willing to share the responsibility of such a course. The noble earl the Secretary for Foreign Affairs had accused the Chinese of constant infractions of the treaty, but it appeared to him that the noble earl had forgotten the maxim that persons who live in glass houses should not throw stones. (Hear, hear.) Had there been no infraction of the treaty on our part? In 1822 and 1823 we entered into a solemn engagement with the Chinese to suppress the traffic in opium, and, as had been stated by his noble friend (Lord Derby), this very colonial ordinance tended to faciltate that traffic. By the original treaty the residence of British subjects was confined to five ports, but even in the time of Sir H. Pottinger there was established a British settlement in the island of Amoy. By that treaty British subjects were forbidden to go into the interior, but there was now, he believed, a highroad for British commerce between Shanghai and the Chusan Islands. Persons who accused others of a breach of solemn engagements ought at least to have clear consciences themselves. (Hear, hear.) There was one more question which he wished to ask before sitting down, and that was whether Parliament was prepared deliberately to sanction the acts of an official who, without any reference to the Government at home, or to the Chinese Government at Pekin-without one lie of correspondence-on his own responsibility declared hostilities against a peaceful, a friendly, and a commercial town? The war in Persia was, he believed, of a very questionable nature; but there had been some formality in its declaration, inasmuch as it had been proclaimed by the Governor-General of India; but in the present case there had not been even a proclamation of war. It was, in fact, of so unconstitutional a nature that what had taken place rather deserved to be called acts of rapine and violence than to be described as operations of war. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl had stated that the question was one which might arise between any two nations in Europe, and cestainly he was much surprised at that statement. Suppose, for instance, the consul at Marseilles became involved in a difference with the French authorities, and on his own authority summoned the British fleet, and, after seizing a French brig, within 48 hours commenced bombarding and shelling the town, would any Government of this country support the consul who had acted in such a manner, or, if they did, would either Hlouse of Parliament support them? Or could there be found in Europe one single State, however insignificant it might be, which would not indignantly resent such an indignity 7 The noble earl had also used the smgular expression, "the law of force." Now, he had always thought that law signified eome established rule to which force was an exception, but the expression of the noble earl, if it meant anything, would seem to imply that force should be the rule and established law, the exception-in fact. that might should be right. (Hear, hear.) It was impossible to calculate what might be the result of the present war, in which the French and Americans were now active parties; but, if the result were as successful to the British arms as could possibly be hoped for, the result might be to place this country face to face with that very Power of whoso aggression the Government had always expressed the greatest apprehension. (Hear, hear.) If there were anything in those apprehensions, and if it were necessary to preserve Turkey and Persia as non-conductors of politcal and aggressive intrignie, surely it was of e Iual importance to preserve China. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl opposite had justly referred to the injurious effect which this war would produce to the cause of Christianity in China; but he might console himself by observing from the papers before the House that the Sunday had been most carefully observed. He had read that part of the papers with great pain, for he could not but looc upon that statement as a mockery of religion. (Hear.) He would not dwell on the violence and intemperance of the language which had been employed by the British authorities at Canton, but he 2nust say that that passage with regard to the observance of the Sunday was one of the most remarkable in the whole papers. This war had been charac. terized by the Government as just, necessary, and expedient; but how could it be necessary when the object of it had been condemned by three Foreign Secretaries. Could it be just when it was undertaken with one pretexst on the lip and another in the heart? Ithad beentrulysaid that injurywas swift and justice slow. Injury in this case had been swift indeed; but it was the duty of their lordships, a s the court of lasts appeal, to see that the rights of every one were secured, and that justice, however tardily, should at length be done. (Chet-,rs.)
Lord METHUEN said that, notwithstanding the splendid display of eloquence which they had beard from the nDble earl opposite on Tuesday last~, it was his intention to vote against the motion. He trusted, however, that nothing would fall from him during the few remar7s which he was about to make which would seem to indicate any wat of respect for the transcendent talents and very high position of the noble earL It appeared to him that the quesion which they had to consider was very clea ud simple,-it was whether the lorcha Arrow' w.aaBiitish verse? or not, (Hear, hear.) The only evidence whicl be. ha. *hai s was not a British vessel was that furnished b -
missioner Yeh and the r-iknd of Chiue. Now,a-
clear in this case that Conmissionir Y-h w. s ay, .nte e, witness, and, as to the testimonyof the F-ic,,d of Cai., hie hardly thought that the leading articl- *f a newspaper could be accepted as affordiun' incontr' .tibe roe o a disputed fact. The evidence which he had that the English flag was carried by the master of the lorcha was that of two Irishmen and two Chinese; and against that be had no ot;er evidence than that of Comiissioner Yeh himself. He cc l' only judge of Commissioner Yeh's opinion on the subjeca. v hether she was a British vessel by his conduct, and if Comnsnssioner Yeh did believe her to be a British vessel it was pretty clear that his intention was to insult the flag of this country. His principal reason for thinking that the Commissioner looked upon the Arrow as a British vessel was the great promptitude with which he returned the men whom he had taken prisoners. Yeh was evidently a very obstinate man; one would imagine that his name should have been " Nay" instead of "Yea"-(a laugh) and it was clear that he would never have given up those prisoners if he bad not believed the vessel to be a British one. He regretted to bear the strong terms in which the noble earl had thought proper to characterize the conduct of Sir J. Bowring, because such epithets as " disgusting," applied to the conduct of our representative there, must tend very much to depreciate Sir J. Bowning in the eyes of the Chinese. He trusted that their lordships would not yield to the opinmon of the noble earl upon this subject, but that theyw ould support the British agents at that great distance from England; for if they did not no Minister could ever expect to be faithfully and properly served abroad.
Lord ST. LEONABD's and Lord WENSLxYXiALE rose together; but, after a somewhat prolonged contest, the latter eventually gave way.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S said that he was sorry to ntervene between his noble and learned friend and the House; but as he had risen early on Tuesday night to address their lordships, and had then given way to the noble earl opposite (Earl Grey), he trusted that he should not b thought discourteous if he now persisted in his right to address the House. (Hear, hear.) Considering the parti. cular relation which he bore to their lordships in their judicial character, he felt that he olught in justification of his vote to state shortly the grounds on which he intended to vote, and, having heard doctrines of international law enunciated in that House which were wholly unwarranted, he thought that it was his duty to rise to vindicate the law itself. (Hear, hear.) Of the two questions which they had to consider one was strictly judicial, and the other was simply a matter of fact. With respect to the judicia point, he assured them that he should not state one word which he would not state at a morning sitting if he were called upon to give an opinion in adjudicating between the parties. There was an essentia dcifference between the attributes of the House in the morning, when they discharged judicial functions, and those which appertained to them in the evening, when they acted in their legislative capacity. In the morning, when strict justice was administered according to law,
and wnen all the facts were sifted, the two contending parties were always before the House; they were both heard, and the decision was arrived at after an impartial hearing and the most mature consideration. But on the present
occasion they were in a different position, for the Chineme were not there to defend their own conduct. The Government very naturally supported the acts of their subordinates in China, and it remained for those of their lordships who believed that the Chinese had been wrenged to stand in the place of the Chinese there, and to see, in the absence of that
rower, thatnight and justice were done. The question of whether the lorcha Arrow was a Chinese or a British vessel was strictly and simply one of a judicial character; and in order to appreciate it accurately they mast first direot their attention to the treaty itself. There could be no doubt that the Chinese had been compelled to surrender Hongkong to this country ; and thethird article of the treaty stated that it was desirable and advisable that British subjects should have
a port in C whieh they could refit and careen their ves-
se, and where tmight deposittheirstoreforthatpurposeThell, looking stethe ninth article of the treaty,, they found thatitexpr-ssly prohibited thedhinesefrom tang out ofan English ship, or from Hongkong, any person who in their estimation had been guilty of a criminal act without making application to the British consul. The words were, "If any suchperson shall flee toHongkong, orto anEnglishshipof war,oranEnglish merchant ship," andsoon; Now, could any one suppose that it was ever meant by those words to in-
clude a Chinese junk of war, or that a Chinese merchant junk meant the same thing as an English merchantman ? (Heair, hear.) Our navy consisted either of ships of vwar'or of merchant ships belonging to this country, and to' attept o drw fom his rtile a arumet ini favour of
the jowwerof thiscunr tcolUtreais Chtin elercbanftsbiF or
armed ship assa British vesselappeared to him to be utterly absurd. (Ha, hear,a.) Turnng next to the 17th article
of the treaty, he found that the wordsthereiused were "ani smell vesseis belonging to the English nation." This carried
the point a step further. The ninth article refei red So ships of war and merchantmen. and in the 17&h article the small craft were included. What was meant by small craft ? Pl1Inly smal craft belonging to the Enylish nation, not Chinese smal c- raft. (Hear, hear.J This appeared to him so plain that he could not understand how an opposite conclusion anrrived at. (Cheers.) Yet it ceemed to be supposed that we were at liberty to convert by the mere force of apaper certificate a whole fleet of Chinese junks into English vessels, if we were so disposed. HTear, hear. Having thus seen the intent of the treaty,
t teiar lor ship next consider what was the effect of the Imperial law. The Imperial law of this country was that you could not have a, British shi unless it was British owned, and that law applied to ll the colonies. Aliens could be naturalized forthis purpose, but they were required to produce a certificate that they had taken the oath of allegiance. With regard to the ordinance of which they ba eard so much, the noble earl opposite (Clarendon) contended that that ordinance could not be affected by the law of 1854, bemuse it was brought into operation before that law was passed. Was it the intention of the noble earl to represent to their lordships that there was no law apblicable to the ordinance before 1854 ? (Hear, bear.) If the law of 1854 did not apply to this prrtieular ordinance the law previous to it did, and the ordinance would be equally ivalid according to that law. (EBear, hear.)
jhet.erby Actshefore the Act of 1854, or by the Act of

Something was said abov t the vessel having a British master, but it was not the British master, biit the trirsh owner, which made a vessel British. Sir John Bowring and Mr. Consul Parkes both expressly stated that any one fhavin a register under the eoonern ordinatce would be entitleG to hoist -the BrLteis flag; but he declared-> rstesmny -whoul Ievlieus, as
constititional lawyer, thiet tro ordinance, to the extent to which it was carried, was a simple piece of waste paper. (Hear, hear.) dtohe Governor had no power to pass it, and, foreseeing the difficulties it reight occasion it was a long while before the Government wor a einse the Crown to snuction it. The titlw to regard the Arrow as a British vessel rested on the two ordinances, which professed to be under Aets of the Imperia Legislature. The Governnient were so impressed with the conviction that the finst ordinance wa contrary to law that they endeavoured to reel the operation oJ the 547th setion of the Act of 1854 ant give validity to the first ordinance by a second: There -was nio power in the Governor of Houigkong to convert a Chinese into a Briti vessel, and so far the ordinances were a perfect nullty. Sir J. Bowring had not the slightest notioh of the operation of his own ordinance. It never entered Into the winds of the Government and quegislature of the colony that registers would ever be used, as aid the Chinese authorities, to break down the allegiance A ch Chinese subjects owed to their legitirast Sovereign (Hear, hear.) He begged to call the attention of their lordehips to the words of the ordinance. After rciting that mayllfhegal acts had resulted from registers being granted atrisgkong under timperial Acts, it went on to enact that " froma and after the passing of this ordinance no ship or vestel whatever oaned by a British subject shal be at libert to tradein aLny of the harbonrs of this colony unless, in the case of an outward trading ship or vessel, she be provided with a certificate of registry in conformity with the Imperia Acts of Parliament on that behalf, and, in the case of a China trading ship orvesel, she has in all respects compited with the requirem*ents of -this ordinance.s
The ordinance had not the sightest relation to the question beforethed ouse. The noble eal l(Cisendon) had said hat the ordinance of March did not contravene any British law, but that was a mere assertion, destitute of proof. It was said that it had been passed before the Merehant Shipping
Act came into force in the colony; but, even so, there hdg
teen anotherlaw in existence be ore the Merchant Shipping Act. The noble earl had also told the House the ordinance would have contravened the law if it bestowed an English register, but that, in fact, it gave onl a colonial register.
as it, then, to be understood, after a the discussion that had taken plc hat the reoister was notfa British r ster? (H.ear, har.)W the Arrow an English ship wthout a British regaster [The Ear of Clarendon.-A colotial register.] it was colonial only, it was mere wastepaper.- if it were Brintit h let it stand or fall by the Imperial law. What right had the colonial authorities to interfere in the river of Canton ? (Hear, hear.)

The noble sl bad. also told them that Hongkong was aconquered colony, and that the Crown, with the assistance ofthe Lgisfature of a conquered colony, could dealaszit pleasedwith it. Without entering upon any arguinent as tothecharterofthecoof the o so Hongkon, he (Lord St. Leonard's) would remind the House that the Imperial Legislature had put Au end to that particular power of the Crown, ofd had deared. what should constitute a British vese entiated to mha the British fgag al ovei the world.

Now, he would take the liberty of saying that the law which his nobble and learned friend haid down was not the l£w of nations. (Cheers.)

The object e as Hwf coureto make vessels owhich enjoyednthe privilege of Britrish proection report thewa selver repularp y at this interval.The ordinance accordingly specified that each
iter s eould be in force fording year from the date
tnereor, ana no longer ;" that at the ead of that period it was renewable if properly applied for; but that upon the
expiration of the term it became ipso facto in-
vaiid. There was a further proviso that such regis-
ter should be deposited at the office of the Colonial Secretary one week before the expiration of the year. Did not this prove it to be absolutely necessary that the registers shoid be renewed within the year? Xow, it had been gratuitously supposed that this vessel was at sea as the time, and that, being at sea, she was not bound to have her license renewed at the exact period mentioned. If such a provsion v. ere once allowed, however, the door would be open to the very miachiefa "aait which the Governm ent of Hongkong evidently wi8hea to guard. A vessel in such a case had only to keep at sea at the period when the license became out of datc, and, according to this doctrine, she might, without renewing it, keep the British flag flying for six or seven years and claim British protection. (Hear.) He took it, then, that the moment the year expired a vessel lost its night (if ever it had acquired one) under this ordinance. Their lord shad heard that this was the opinion of Sir John Bowing. Consul Barkes had the regiser deposited with hm on the 3d; he knew it was void- on the lthSir John Bowring himself became acquaintel with the same fact; and Sir John then wrote in the most explicit terms, stating that the right to the register had expired, and that it would be impossible legally to give the Arrow the benefits of that ordinance. The conduct of Sir John Bowring on thispoint bad been referred to in terms strong certainr
but ho thought not too strong, considering the nature of the offence, which was entirely unworthy of the representative of a great and eivilized country when dealing even with 'whatwas called " a semi-barbarous" country with which we were on terms of amity. (Hear, hear.) What the British authorities ought to have done was this-they knew that the right to hoist' the British flag was gone, and then it would have been the easiest thing in the world to say to Commissioner Yeh that an insult had been ofTered to tht British flag,which under other circumstances could not have been passed over, but that it would not be noticed on this
occasion because the Arrow was at the time carrying the English flag without a license. (Hear.) Instead of this, however, Sir John Bowring was, on the . ne hand, representing to Commissioner Yeh that this register was in fuU force at the time of the seizore while at the same time he was uing that he would consider whether or not he would re-re2satrt the lorcha, and was re3erving his Iight to do so. He (Lord St. Leonard's) repeated that it was unworthy the representative of this great country to play such a double part as this. (Hear.) And then what as to the apology required and offered? In a very short time after their seizare the 12 men were returned by the Chinese, and Commissioner Ych promised that the occurrence should not happen again, and that in future the usual reference should be mado to the British ConsuL Mr. Parkes, however, demanded that the men should be publicly restored, and upon this simple question of form, apparently introduced for the purpose of embarraming the question, tho rupture took place. Now, let these facts be stated for the first time to any assembly of Enoishmen; let such an assembly be told that 12 persons, subjects of the Emperor of China, were seized by Chinese officials, on board a Chinese vessel, in Chinese waters, two of them being notoiious pirates ; let it be added that after a remonstrance these men were returned, the Chinese Commissioner promising to guard Against a recurrence of the event; and see how it. would startle the common sense of a body of Fnglishmen to be told that Mr. Parkes rejected these 12 men, sent them back, and took what he called "active measures" thereupon. (Rear hear.) It was not denied that two of the crew carried of were notorious pirates, and Yeh asked for the return of these two men, as he was perfectly justified in doing according to the terms of the treaty. But none of the concessions
oade by the Chinese would serve. What was supposed to be a war junk, but turned out to be a merchant vesseL was cut out by the British authorities. Well, that in itself was reparation, but apparently it was mot enough, From step to step the admiral on the station proceeded, destroying Chinese vessels, breaching the walls, Amng upon theCommissioner's residenc and making a forcible entry into Canton. In the late war Odessa was spared. It was a town fuU of men and materal of war, and from which large supplies could be drawn for the defenders of Sebastopol, and it was also fortified; and if Odessa were spared-and great credit was taken for sparing it-why could not Canton be spared also? (Loud enes of "Hear, hear.") There was nothing in Canton to affect the power of the British forces, while in Odessa the case was quite the reverse; and yet Odessa was ipared. He itd not blame the Government for sparing Odessa, because he should be sorry to see the foroes of this
eat em'e brought to bearupon a defenoeless city. (Hear, ear,)t why bombard Canton? (Hear, hear.) The answer was, unfortunately, an easy one. Canton was at
uor feet. (Hear, hear.) From the unfortunate condition which the Government of China was placed there was no chance of retaliation. A civil war wap raging throughout
the countr, nd what glory oould there be at any timein a. war with, Cina ? It bad been shown what they were worth in previous wars, and in 1847 General D'Agusar captured Canton without, he believed, the loss of a single man. How hadthe Americans acted? They had been fired upon, and, after destroying the forts which had fired upon them, they considered that they had exacted surficient repartion and retired. The Fiench, also, although they said that we were acting rightly, asked to be allowed to go away, and yet we after destroying the forte, must noeds proceed to bombard a defenceless town. (Hear.) Before resuming his seat he wished to call their lordahips attention to thefact that some of the influential persons in the city of Canton exprescd the opinion that satsfactory terms might be arranged. In conclusion, he prayed their lordships to consider what the effect of their vote must be. If they agreed to the taotion no mischief could by po'sibility result, and the consequence would beto authorize the Government to put a termination to the lamentable contest which was now going on. If, on the other hand, they rejeced the motion the war we were waging would be continued, Sir J. Bowring and Mr. Parkes would construe the result into au approbation of their conduct, and they would insist upon the right of free andimmediate access to the city of Canton, although it seemed to bejenerall dmitted that no commensurate advantages weoid flowrom the exercise of that right. Our trade would be stopped, property would be injured, life would be sacrificed and we shonld be imposing a great af ction pon the u tincse at a timps hen that nation was alread in deepatrib lation It was simply a question of te c-a onTue o cessation of the war, nd he enhreated heir lordships, by supporting the notion, to do all in their power to put an end to so grent a calamity (Hlear,

What he said wvas, that it de}ended upon the license or register of each particular country to say whether a ship were a national ship or not. Prom that proposition he never could be shaken, and it was monstrous to assert that third persons were competent to decide a question of£that nature. He maintained unhesitatingly that that was the principle of international law. (Elear, hear.)

Let them displace him from that if they could-
Lord ST. LEONARD'S.-Jy noble and learned friend is out of order in replying to me.
The LORD CHANCELLOR continued.-He really was astonished, after his noble and learned friend bad repretented the Lord Chancellor of England as having mrsinformed them on a point of law, that he should complain that he was "replying," when he claimed their lord. ships' indulgence to allow him to axplain what he really did say. (Hear.) His noble and learned friend must allow him to observe, moreover, that when he (Lord St. Leonard's) accused the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of having misstated the law when he said that the ordinance cime into immediate operation, his noble and learned friend feSl into a meest grievous mistake in point of law, (Cries of intOrder " m5 order I") He felt that he was out of order, and he-would not therefore add another word.
Lord TWEISLEYDALEB (who spoke with his hack to the gallery, and in so low X tone as to be all but inaudible) was understood to say that with *espect to the firt of the three resolutions which had been submitted to the House he apprehended that there would be no difference of opinion. This resolution was to this effect-
" That this House has heard with deep regret of the interruption of amicable relations between Her Majesty's subjects and the Chinese authorities at Canton, arising out of the measures adopted by Her Majesty's Chief Superintendent of Trade to obtain reparation for aileged infractions of the sxlpplemantary treaty of the 8th of October, 1843."
He conceived that there was no one in that House who could doubt the truth of that proposition, because undoubtedly it was the melancholy resultof thoseproceedings that they must endanger our trade and occasion a vast loss of life and property,which every one must regret. The two other resolutions were those which were to be the subject of consideration that evening. They expressed an opinion that the ' occurrence of differences on this subject rendered the time peculiarly unfavourable for pressing on the Chinese authorities a claim for the admittance of British subjects into Canton, which had been left in abeyance since 1849, and for supporting the same by force of arms," and, "that in the opinion of this House operations of actual hostility ought not to have been undertaken without the express instructions, previoucly received, of Her Majesty's Government, and that neither of the subjects adveited to in the foregoing resolutions afforded sufficlent justification for such operations." It appeared to him that those two resolutions might very properly be divided into two questions-the first, whether the Chinese had been guilty of an unjustifiable act in entering upon the Arrow contrary to the law of nations and to the stipulations of the treaty; and the second, whether the particular maode adopted by the British representatives in that country for obtaining redress was the one whibch should have been taken in such an event. Lookig back now upon the events which had occarred, and condiering the mischief which had sccrued, they no doubt would wish that our representatives there had waited for instructions from the Government before proceeding to warlike extremuitics. They ought not now, however, to view the transaction b the light which subsequent events had cast upon it, but shlould place themselves as nearly as possible in the pcosition of those who were called upon to act -notbeing endued with the giit of prophecy or the ability to foresee whiatlwes *bout to occur. (HIear.) Looking at the situa-
tion, uaen, in which our representetives were placed, with a better knowledge than their lordships could have of the
disposition oi the Chinese, was it wise in them immediately to take into their own hands the means of procuring redress by makrng reprisals, seizing one of the Imperial junks, and resorting to tne destructive measure of bombarding the town of Canton? Putting themselves in the position of the officers of the Government at that time, was it made out to their satisfaction that our representatives had acted impro perly? If they had heldtheir handsand had refrained from taking any steps until they received instructions from the homeGovernment, theprobabilitywasthat the Chinese fortifications would have been strengthened, their militar3 defenes
would have been rendercd more complete, and the difficulty of ultimately bringing them to reason would have been immensely increased. (Hear, hear.) Instead of so waiting,
our representatives, knowing the great success which had attended the employment of a very small force in a vigorous manner in 1847, determined upon folloving the exaniple which was then set - and on the whole, putting himself in the position of Sir John Bowring at that tinie, he was not
arepdto say, fterrepeated attempts to obtain redress b'ye other maeair5 bad fd, that he was not jastified
in the course which he had adopted. (Hear, hear.) At the same time he certainly did blame a part of tIe conduct and bearing of S ir John Bowring. The quiestion, therefore was confined to this,A-was there an illegkl act on theparrtoftheChinese, j ustifngusinourdemand forredress,
n4 the enforement of it if rused? The act complained of was the boardinig of the lorcha Arrow with an ar-,ed force and seiing the. crew. The *eight of evidence was that this was'done when the British ensign Iwas flyj,,g, for it was proved by three itnesses, and, in the first inestace, not denied byYeh- The Aro w therefore, had the British colours and a British lioense granted by Sir John Bjwring. Whether the license had expired at the tine lie wonld afterwards consider. Assuming, thaen, tht the license existed, that gave a national character to the vessel,
andt whether it was rightly given or not w:; not a
matter the Chinose could dispute by taking the law into their own hands. If improperly given by the offlcers Df Government, tho aggrieved party vms bound to apply to outr Governient for redress. (Hear, hear.) That was the undotbtedlaw ofnations Bespect wasduetothenational chacter as indicated by .ho licen&e and colours. It could not be 1serfnered with and the vessel seized unless by mutual treaty the power was given. This Was dmitted by tle treaty concluded by the noble lord (AberdeenT in 1845 with Marshal St. Aulaire and the Dao de Broghe for the mutual convenience of trading, in muppressing the slave trade on the coast of Africa. n this pomt of view the inquiry into the power of Sir John Bow. ring to grant the license was material only with respect to his liability to ant such by our law in our coarts of i
tice. (Hear.) Ke doubted much whether the noble lord (Iqadhurst) was ht in his opinion that Sir J. Bowring had not the right. WThe authority was given by the Governor and Council of Hougkong, a colony conquered by the Qeen, in which Her Majesty had the undoubted right hto give Euch laws as she chose, until she was controlled by Parliament. The Governor and Council had authority to make such a law in March, 1855, when it was made, and it was binding, when made, without the Qaeen's consent, but he doubted whether the Act for the British mnercantile nav which came into force on the 1st of May, 1855, did not expressly repeal it. The 537th section, which enabled the Colonial legislature to repeal the Act, with the consent of the Queen in Council, did not seem to apply to the law of the colony in existence before the Act took effect, And so the Government seemed to think, for the Secretary of State had given his sanction to the ordinance of the 3d of March, 1855, since tho Merchant Shipping Act. Though ho doubted much whether Sir J Bowmng would be liable in foro d6rwstico as related to that country, on the ground that his authority was put an end to by theAct of Parliament, he did not mcan to say that the noble and learned lord, whose authority he so CeatY respected, from long experience of his great know-
dge of tne law, directed by his admirable good sense and Powerful intellect, was wren in his views of the case. Tie noble and learned lorz was perfectly rightinthe opinion he had given, that we could not deprive the Government of China of its authority overits own subjects by naking them denizens of Hongkong. Thev are all of tema sill subjects of the Chinese Em p ire, an amenable
o its Sovereign, but this did not a mect the trae question in
hecase5whether bythat Governlment was authorized t. redessitslf y sizing with violence a ship in-41tailI possession of our national flag. (Rear, bear.) If the shp had been on the high seas vwhen seized, then, liy the law of nations, the act Would undoubtedly ho wrong. If, on the other hand, it was then in the pert of Canton, within the territorial bounds of China, the Chlnese bad undoubted authority to seize criminals breaking their laws on board the ship, in this port, asawell as on their ownx territory, and we had no right to treat the seizure as a wrong done tons, unless theChinesehid bvtreatyagreedto gheu the right. That depended upon the tenor of the supplement treaty of 1842, which, he thought, applied to all English ships, especially when the subsequent treaty mentioned horchas. He did not think that the noble earl (Grey) was right in limiting it to ships described in the Registration Act "British owned," with three-fourthe of the crew English subjects, built in England and repaired abroad. Otherwise, if the Parliament should please atterwards to alter these pro.
isons and diminish the required crew to one-half, or make any other slight alteration, the protection of the vessel would be lost. It was impossible to read the treaty is if All the particulars required by the Act were in the treatw and formed part of it. This being so, the word " English
must be understood in a more lax sense, and would include the vessel in question. That part of the crew were Chinese subjects made no difference. The Baltic Powers-Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden-gave the national character to ships owned by anyresidents fora short time in their respective do. minions. The case mightbemadeclearer bysupposingatreaty made with the French Emperor by us for the extradition of EDglish crloinael by us, similar to the treaty of the Chinese wit our Government. Assuming by the French lsw that no ship should have a French license unless with certain ;uaifications, and should have an entire crew of
renchmen, could we seize the French ship and take out the criminal by force, or the English crew, on the ground that the lioense was irregular and not warranted by the French law? It is clear we could have no such right, and our so doing would be a violation of inter. national law. The only remaining point was whether on the 8th of Ootober, when the violent seizure took place by the Chinese authorities, the license had expired. When there iS a license for a hmited time, and the ship is out of the port of reglstration, it continues, from the very nature of the case, beyond the prescribad limit for such a time as to enablo the ship to reach with reasonable despatch its port of registration. Then was extension absolutely necessary, and implied in the very nature of the transaction itself. It was well known that the whole mercantile navy of Belgium had licenses for two years only, it could not be seriously contended that the national character ceased in whatever past of the globe the Belgian vessel might happen to be at the expiration of the prescribed period. (Ilear, hear.) Sir John Bowring tad mistaken his case in supposing that the license had expired; for it was clear it had not as on the evidence it appeared that the captain of the lorcha at the moment of the seizure was intending to return to Hongkong, and renew his license, having previously deposited his license in the Hlongkong registry. He therefore concluded that the aei
sure was clear1ywong, entitling the British authoritiesto demand redress, and, consideringthe case precisely asitatood on* the 8th of October, without any regard to subsequent events, he was not satisfied that the British officers bedtacted unwisely or imprudently in resorting to immediate force, (Cheers.)
The Earl of MAIMESBURY said that if before the debate began he had felt that the primary cause of the transactions which they were considering was out of all propor. tion with the dreadful consequences which had followed, he had been stilt more impressed with that opinion when he found the ablest lawyers in the House taking precisely opposite views upon the same point. Surely if noble and learned lords were perplexed to discover the meaning of technicalities, a semi-barbarous people and a Chinese commissioner might well be excused for not understanding them. If the Chinese were to be attacked and despised for their ignorance noble lords who believed that the Chinese had right on tbeir
side were equally open to scorn and derision. (Hear, hear.), There were two very important questions for their lordships to consider- one of morality and the other of policy. It often happened that those -who took part in politics, especially in Parliamentary asmblies, sought to excuse great political immoralities for the sake of some great poll. tical good; but he regretted to say there was as much im. policy as there was immorality in the proceedings under consideration, and that neither the one nor the other could be excused on any ground of public or political good. They were now considering whether it was safe to delegate to our representatives in our colonies and foreign possessions the power of waging war with a foreign Government (hear, hear) without having first pplied for permission to the Government at home, and-what was worse in bis opinionwithout even appealing to the Government against whom they intend to make war (hear, hear). for the House would recollect that bir John Jowring, in an early part of the correspondence, especially sought to preclude his confederate, as he (the Earl of Malmesbury) must call Consul Parkes, from making any reference of that matter to the Court of Pekin. He must say, to the credit of the admiral, so far as his conduct was reflected in the papers before them, he appeared to have acted with far greater discretion than either Sir J. Bowring or Consul Parkes, and with some reference to the comity of nations. (Hear, hear.) He made at least some approach to the observance of civilized forms, so far as he appeared to have been concerned in the matters in dispute. But their lordships needed no argument to show the dreadful danger of committing the exercise of powers so awful to such hands as those of the English plenipotentiary and consul at Canton; for news had that very day arrived in London that the Chinese had taken the offensive and had attacked the English fleet, while the Chinese rebels who had been waging a civil war in their own country had for a time merged their differences and joined the ranks of the Emperor in Avenging tho cruelties inficted on the citizens of Canton by our officials thee. That proved how impossible it was to say how far a war would extend after the first cannon shot had been fired. (Hear, hear.) He thought it extremely likely that if it had not been for the despatch which the Lord Pre.ident addressed to Sir John Bowring, together with those which he (the Earl of Malmesbury) himself vrote wheni he was at the Foreign-offioe to the same gentleman, the occurrences they had now to deplore would have occurred long ago. (Hear, hear.) And he must say for himself that, knowing something of the man with whom he was dealing on that occasion (a laugh), the despatches he addze-sed to Sir John Bowrmg were couched in language rather more peremptory than he was in the habit of using. He was convinced the question of the Arrow wonld never have been heard of if it had not been convenient to make it a pretext for further proceedings, and for carrying ont the monomania of Sir John Bowring. (Hlear, hear.) He contendbed that the inviolability of the British flag would have been fully vindicated at the time by she seizare ofthe junk, or, at all events, when the admiral took possession of the Barrier forts. (Hear, hear.) There would
have been no degradation to the English flag after that, as there was none to that of the Amercans, in their view of the zmatter, after they had silenced the fort which fired upon them. (Hear, bear.) With respect to tho ordinance he should avoid all legal argument- but he was bound to confess that he never understood what the necessity was for such an ordinance. He did not think the preamble of Sir JT Bowrg a all explained its necessity. That it had been effective of no good he (the Earl of Malinesbury) firmly be. lieved; at all events, they know only of the evils it had caused. But there was one consideration which he could not help thinking must have tempted Sir John Bowring to issue that ordinance, and he confebsed that appeared to him likely to be a point of some moment to a gentleman who was supernntendent of trade at Canton. There was no doubt that if registers were given which transformed fleets of Chinese ships and all sorts of crafts with which the Chinese waters swarmed into British vessels the superintendent of trade when he made his returns to this country would be able to point with something like triumph to our largely-increasing trade in that part of the world. That seemed to him the Earl of Malmesbury) the only ex. planation why Sir J. Bowring should have been so anxious to put forth an ordinance which was almost certain to bring hima into difliculties. Sir J. Bowring, indeed, had put him. elf Out of court by an admission in his own handwriting tiat the ship's, certificate bad expired at the time of the capture, that she bad given up her papers to the proper authorities, and that, to use his own, words, she was not entitled to carry the English flag or to the protection of the English6lag. (Cheers.) He could not express in terms too strong the deep disgust he felt at the proceedings of the superintendent oftSrade. His noble friend (the Earl of Derb?bad scarcely put the ease against him in terms uiclently adeg,uate i for it might be in the remembrance of their iordships tSat on the 11th of October Sir John
United States of America to China, &c., referring to the notice of the 9th instant, hereby makes known that the reply of the Imperial Commissioner to his Excellency's despatch of that date was received last evening, and that with the semblance of a desire to maintain friendly relations between the two countries the same disposition ts evade ob1;gation,rmisrepresent facts, and erroneously interpret treaty stipulations which for years has characterized tbe correspondences of Lmperial Commissioners still obtains with his Excellency Yeh. (Cheers.) The resumption of trade to any exctent at the or of Caten during the existence of the local hostilities is not encouraged by the tenonr of the communication now received."
Now, I really think that it is trifling with your lordships to a&sert the superior trnth-telling *.f the Chinese, while, on the other hand, I think it is quite consistent with certain good parts of their character s a nation to doubt their appreoiation of the value of truth. At all events, when I have the evidence of two of my countrymen on oath, all I can say is that until those individuals are shown to be unworthy of freedom, I, for one, shall continue to attach some authority to their statements. (Hear.) The next point is whether the Arrow had any right to hoist the British flag on this occasion. Now, I am certainly not going to weary your lordships with the law of this case. r think it would be presumptuous in me to weaken as I went along that ve, y clear and unanswerable argument put fotward by the noble baron who has so lately taken his seat in this House (Lord Wensleydale), who showed, beyond doubt, that untl the Merchant Shipping Act was pasred the Crown had power to issue such an ordinance as the one under discussion; that he had some doubt-a doubt which could onl
be removed by a trial in a court of law-whether the Act in question repealed that ordinance or not; but, whether this was proved one way or the other, he stated that it did not in the slightest degree invalidate our international right on this subject in connexion with the Chinese. (Hear, hear.) I must say that when, in listening, one finds noble and learned lords so differing among themselves a considerable difficulty must present itself to your lordehips generally. Then a noble and learned lord opposite (Lord St. Leonard's) stated it was impossible for one country to invest the subjects of another with a protection as against the Government of that country. Almost immnediatel
afterwards, however, he cited an Act, one clause of wbich gives power to create a denizen and a shipowner in every respect entitled to British protection. Your lordships therefore have it laid down t sat our municipal law in certain cases actually bids us give a register and a flag to a shi
which yet, says the noble and learned lord, by internaional law, we have no right to give. Then a noble lord opposite quoted a letter from Sir George Grey, which is supposed to lay down the rule as regards naturalization. But does tha' rule apply to other countries? A noble and learned lord who has recently left this House for his seat in the South of France once applied to the French Government to be naturalized. The reply was, "We cannot, unless you give up your nationality as an Englishman." Now, Englishmen are naturalzed in France, and yet our law is such that we have a right to hang these persons if we find them in arms against this country. All this proves that on these very refined and subtle questions of international law points arise so delicate and difficult that even among the most civilized nations of the West you have come to no agreement on the point; and I do think therefore you are going too far (though undoubtedly you are bound to act with justice towards Orientals) when you are asked to bind yourselves with the cobwebs of your own subtleties in dealing with a nation which utterly denies the existence of any jus gcntium, and refuses to have any connexion with foreign countries. (Hear, hear.) These are points of law which may be argued more ably that I can pretend to argue them. What I come to now is this:-Were Sir John Bowring, Admiral Seymour, and Mr. Parkes, sharing, as they do, the responsibilty of these transactions, justified in considering that the British flag ought to be hoisted? Going back to the correspondence of 1855, I find there a letter from Sir John Bowring to Commissioner Yeh, recapitulating what had taken place with regard to two lorchas, the crews of which were convicted for smuggling, in which case theChinese authorities, contrarytothe treaty, besides seizing the goods, had soized and dismantled the vessels themselves. In reply to Yeh's statement that these were Cbinese, and not British vessels, Sir John Bowring furnishes him with a translation of the ordinance, explains the objects of that ordinance, and describes how it will assist bothpartiesinobtaininganob,ject mutuallydesired,-namely, the putting down of smugghng. (Hear.) On the part of Yeh not the xlightest symptom of non-acquiescence is given to that communication. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir J. Bowring having sent all these papers home, they were submitted by the Secretary of State for the opinion of the then law officers of the Crown. Havinz received their opinion upon the whole of the papers submitted to them, Lord Clarendon announced to Sir J. Bowring that he entirely approved his conduct. Now, I say that the conduct of Sir J. Bowring, in making any demand whatever as to these lorchas, would have been utterly indefensible unless they came within the purview of the supplementary treaty, being authorized at the same time by the ordinance. This being the case, I ask your lordships what was the course which Her Majesty's plenipotentiary took. In the course of this debate our law has been represented by many speakers as bad, and the treaty has been picked to pieces as inequTitable; but were these considerations to weigh with Sir J Bowring 9 Was he to be the person to say, " This is certainly the law; this is certainly in my instructions from the Foreign-offlce, it is sanctioned by the highest legal opinions at home, but I myself think the law bad ; I shall therefore take it upon myself to put a perfectly different construction upon it ?" (aear, hear.) If Sir John Bowring had done this all I can say is he would have been guilty of a decided dereliction of his duty. (Hear, hear.) If that had been the case we should perhaps have had complaints but they would have been of a very different character. (Hear, hear.) It would have been said, here is this Radical of the Manchester school, who for the temporary and paltry interests of commerce neglects the honour of the British fla-thpt flag which has never incurred a stain, and upon which every Englishman in the most remote district of the world looks and is reminded that he belongs to a nation which has never known shame, defeat, or humiliation, and which is renowned for carrving to the utmost part of the earth vengeance for wrongs inflicted upon her subjects. That is something like the kind of language we should have heard, but becausse Sir J. Bowring did not take that extreme view he has been denounced in a way in which I think no public servant has ever been denounced before. (Hear, hear.) For my own part, I should have thought that the very fact of SLr J. Bowring having served under the noble earl opposite (Lord Malmesburj)
would have made that noble earl more cautious in attack-- ing min. What are the antecedents of Sir J. Bowring? Af tar having most admirably discharged his consular duties he was appointed to his present position, and on his appointment addresses were sent to the Foreign-office Complaining that he was not intrusted with sufficient powers. A noble earl opposite has quoted some opinions of Chinese merchants withl regard to the conduct of Sir J. Bowring; hut, my lords, you must remember that Sir J. Bowring imposed upon the British merchants the necessity of paying duties which for six years they had evaded, and therefore was not very likely to be a popular man; and that fact at the present moment tells in his favour, because all those merchants are unanimous in giving him their support (Hear, hear.) Since that address to which the noble earl re fesred, Sir J. Bowring and Mr. Parkes have negotiated a most important treaty with Siam. It has been said that even assuming that the lorcha Arrow had a right to hoist the British flag, the reparation demanded was of an extravagant character. Now, my lords, I cannot agree to that statement. (Hear, hear.) The fact of boarding the Arrow, and thus entirely disregarding the stipulations of the treaty, speaks for itself; and the demand made by Consul Parkes was a moderate demand, and I cannot see why the Chinese authorities should have refused to give satisfaction in the way then demanded. It has been said that we got the substancer but not the exact reparation with all the publicity which we asked for ; but in that country of punctilio and ceremony publicity is a matter of the utmost importance. It must be remembered, my lords, that in dealing with Oriental nations, and perhaps more especially with the Chinese, it is almost fatal to our interests to take any step which they can possibly construe into weakness or vacillation; and they are but too apt to regard in that light any attempt at conciliation. As an instance, I may mention the case of Sir G. Bonham, who having displayed forbearance in the blockade of Eongkong, that forbearance was attributed to fear and indecision, and tablets were struckto celebrate the retreat of the outside barbarians. I think, my lords, that we ought not altogether to keep from our view what effect our proceedings have upon the minis of these people. (Hear, hear.) No man can regret moro than myself anything which approaches the horrors of war; but, at the same time, I am bound to say that, notwithstanding all that has been stated, in my opinion geoat care was taken by the admiral to warn unoffending citizuns away from any place where mischief mihtt oocur, and full time was given them to profit by that warning. I make this statement, my lotds,f because I think it would not be fair on the part of ,your lordships to place an indelible mark upon these men by placing it upon record that in your opinion they have used unnecessary violence. (Hear, hear.) Much effect was produced bythe reference of tho noble earl to the shelling of the residence of Yeh. Now, my lords, when once recourse is had to hostilities it appears to me most prudent and, at the same time, most merciful to adopt those means which will be most likely to lead~ to practical results; and I cannot help thinkin that Commnissioner Yeh is a man who would be more move
b.y the injury done to his own property than by the destruction of that of unoffending citizens, or even of soldiers. Noble lords have referred to what they are pleased to call the monomania of Dr. Bowring on the subject of a free admission to Canton. I beg pardon, I havo used tho word Doctor, but I assure your lordships I did not do se in the way in which it has been used by tbo noblo earl (Lord EUlenborough), who, by the peculiar stress he laid upon the word, evidently intended to apply it inna manner calculated to create ridicule. (Hear, hear.) As to the state. ment of Sir J. Bowring with regard io the protection to vrhich the Arrow was entitled, I can only say that I rely upon the doctrine so ably laid down by my noble andlearned friend (Lord Wensleydale) that it is of the greatest importance not to allow a foreign Government to deal with individual cases, but if they think that wrong is done in any particular case to insist upon their making proper reprosentations to the Government. Sir J. Bowring may hava
had a temporary doubt as to the rioht of tho Arrow to pro. tection, and there niy appear a slight contradiction in the words used, but ho fet and knew that he had a good and valid ground for demanding reparation for the insult which had been offered. (Hear, bear.) As regards monomania, I beheve that the term implies a single species of madness in
an individual. Now, I don't know if, besides the opinion that great advantage wiould arise from free admsissson to CantOn, Sir J. Bowring has any other madness; but if this beoa madness Sir J. Bowinng is not the only person who is afficted by it. In lv845 the noble earl below me (Lord Aberdeen),hnm despatch to SirJ. Davis stated that.
" It would certainly be desirable to obtain free access to the city of Canton, and I am prepared to sanction your attempts in that respect. Much prudence, however, will be required IUndeaingith the question, and srobably there is more around for the apprehensions of the Chinese autho. rities with regard to the difficulty of controlling the pop u
lace at Canton than experience has showFn to have been the case at Foo-ehow- foo, But thioie authorities seem to have
the Dower, wren they have tlhe Inclination, to keep lho peoplo in order; and when they *re made to perceive thai theresponsbity of any breach of the pece commnitte by toe people will fall upon themselves, they ray be expected to take effectual measures to prevent 8uch an oocurrence."
I do not in the least impute blame to the noble earl forthat opinion, bat I merely refer to it to show that. Sir J. Bowring is not the only yerson who is convinoeaj of the desirability of free admission to Canton. (Hear, hear.) As regards the natural disposition of the Chinese to hold intercourse with foreigners, I will read to your lordships a statement from a high authority upon this subjecL It is a statement published by the Chinese isWonarySociety:-
"In Europe people have strong Ides of the inmnobility of this people . . Who, for instanoe, is rot convinced thatthis people has a natural antipathy to foreigners, and hbae. always endeavoured to keep them away from its frontiers ? Yet nothinig can be more incorrect. This exclusive and. jealous spirit belongs particularly to the Mantchoo Tartars,. and it is only eince the oommencement of their rule that the empire has been hermetically sealed to foreigners. Irs past ages the Chinese kept up constant relations with all the oountriesof Asia. Arabs, Persians, and Indians traded intheir ports Without hindrance; they even penetrated intothe interior, and freely traversed the provinces."
It appears therefore, my lords, that there is no natural repugnance on the part of the Chinese to free intercourse with foreigners. Is Sir Tohn Bowring alone in that? Is not everybody in China con-
nected with our trade of the same opinion? Do not.' the Governments of the United States and of Franceholdthatview ? And is itfair, when a man shares in an,
opinion of that sort, that you should brand him, in a serious. d=scussion of this nature, with the degrading epithet of a monomaniac? The noble lord referred to the general instructions which I gave to a gentleman who acted as a. temporary Cbarg6 d'Affhires; but my instructions amounted.
only to a rather lengthened version of one of Talleyrand'srecommendations to a diplomatist-"Above all things, not too much zeal." The two Secretaries of State who olwed me admitted that the advantage to be gained from a freeaccess to the city would be considerable, but they doubted whether it would be commensurate with the risk to be incurred in insisting upon the right. When t*s ocurrencetook place, however, the aspect of matters Was completelychanged, and it appears to me that a fair and reasonable opportunity was afforded to your plenipotentiaryforpressing7 his claims. I beg your lordships to remember that Sir J.
Bowring did not, even under the indignities which had been. put upon his nation, demand his extreme rights, but that hemade a very limited and moderate demand, to which he was. fully entitled by the treaty. (Hear.) With regard to thepoint thatthere ought to have been a greater delay, I caunotagree with wvhat has fallen from the noble lord, eoniderin.
that it wouldl have beeni at least four maonths before Sir 7- Bowing could havereceeived ais answer to any questiona which he might have put to the Government. If Sir X. Bowring had a right to believe that an insult was offered to
the British flag, a great principle was involved. Supposethat, instead of 12 se oenglishmn had bees n taken out of such a Iorcha and had been carried into the country, would your plenipotentiary have been justified, being provided with a naval force, in holding his hands and, sending home to know what he should do to save thatmyan from assasination, or from the horrible tortures which we reaLd of their baving inflicted upon a missionary? The inconvenience of sendaig home the efore for instrction. was very great. I have no doubt that Sir t. ownrink, Sir M. Seymour, and Mr. Parkes thought at first that the taking posesnsion of a war junk would be sufficient to show the Chinese Government that the English were in earnest, ans that they would have seen that the matter was adjusted ; and with a man less obstinate than Yeh I believe that msch a step would have been succbesful; but supposrig that no such measure had been taken, and that instructions had arnrved at the end of four months to take certain moderate measres, it is quite likely that such moderate steps would,
after that interval of tine, have been wholely unequ to - the object in view. Now, my lords, in what I have stated with regard to these plenipotentiarise I have been actuated by a calm and fair review of the circumstances, and bta consideration of what is justly due to their character ;fat; I also feel a lttle anxfious about the position which thiz rouse is goinog to take. The noble earl on Tuesday night, at the end of his very magnificent Seec
made an appehi to the right rev, bench. Th is not the first time that I have seen noble lords opposite, 'whenever they think that the right rev, prelates are not going to vote exactly as they wish, constitutte themselves lay readers to the episcopal bench and read a homily or a sermon to them on the occasion. (Loud cheers.) Sometimes the sermon is long and interesting, and sometimes it is short and tedious. That of the noble earl was moat solemn, mlost impressve, and most eloquent, reminding one, indeed, to a very singular degree, of an appealwhich was made to thatu right rev, bench by one of his eloquent predecessors in that office. I listened with attention to that advice, and the great truth which I evolved from it was that any right rev, spiritualI lord who wished to obtain a tbort cut to fame and to establish for himself at once that he posesTsed all the virtues which could adorn a Christiax prelate had only to abdicate the right of private judgment and to put himself and his vote into the hands of the noble earl. (Cheers and a laugh.) I certainly do not venture to give one word of couansel or advice to the right rev. bench, beuse I believe that those noble lords wi take the course which they think they are bound intheirconsciencesto take, undismayed by the censttres of noble lords opposite, or the pathetic lesons addressed to them for the purpose of obtaisnng votes. Another noble earl with less pathos and less loquenceappealed to the younger peers ; but for myself r must say that I have such an opinion of the judicious selection of Lord Palmerston as to tbhink- tht they have
Ite sufficient inteligence to judge for themselves, and
that they are not to becided in their political views by the - disintereste-advichoft. hnoble earL (Cbeers.) Thenoble e-arl also appealed to the collective Wisdom of the hereditary legislators of this House. My lords, in venturing tore pa t- that appeal, I cannot repress one short expression of . gret at the losses which we have lately sustained. This very day the last solemn rites have been performed over the body of one of the most distinguCihed members of your House. It is not given to many men to combine in themselves, both in public and private life, those qualities which made the Eanr of br esmere a type of that character wlsiih I believe has contributed more than anythng to entitle the aristocracy of this country to the resect and regard of all classes. I(ear. bear.) Although we cannot hope to emulate his many virtues, however, I beheve sincerey that there is no member of your lordsahipes House who is not desirous, in the part which he plays here, to act according to the dictates of justice, candour, publia spirit and, let me add, of practical, plain good sense. I beg your jordships, then, to consider the position in which you are plaeed to-niight. You have heard noble lords who have - fille the very highest position in the State, in the law, and in the government of your British possessions-yotu have heard them-the masters of ap n oratory not surpassed in any other asesmblye in the world, use every argumnent that could be thought of, make appeal to passion, employ al their ecx post facto knowledge of events, bring al the weight of their character and position to bear against men some thousands of miles distant from our shores at a moment when they are domug their best to maintain the honour and interest of the country. (Cheers.) I beg you to consider also that, while these different statesmen and lawyers have shown great research in going through all the circumstances of the case, they have either faied or abstained from giving the House a description of what they thought was the course which ought to haveCtaken when the outrage en the Arrow was committed. (Hear, hear.) On the other hand, yon have before you the course which was adopted on the spur of the moment; you hawve had it most thoroughly approvea by all the commercial bodies, who, yt n sou y are snffering sogreatlyshrps
the teinporary disrmption of tradem; an, if e teir concurrence be not sufficient, you have also the approval of foreign nations established there. Under these circumstances, I am sure that your lordships will pause before

The Bishop of OXFORD.-My lords, if I could regard the stibect which you are now debating in the light in which it has been represonted by the noble earl who has just set down, asditinctly a questio of political party, I would not, at least at this hour of tbe night, trouble your lordships withL a single remark of mine ; but it is because, in the most conscientious conviction of my mind, I am persuaded that it is one of those cases that rise into anL atmosphere high above the cries of all political strifes, because it rises into a higher aLnd serener atmosphere, which has to do with national justice or nat~ional crime,
that I must, late as it is, enter for a few moments. into the reasons which lead meo to support the resolutions now on your lordships' table. (Hear,hear.) The first great principle I have to lay down is one the truth of which I am sure any noble lord will be reaLdy to admit. It is that waris either one of the greatest crimaes that a nation can
commit, or else a strong anrd inevitable necessity, forced on a nation by a law of duty from which it cannot escape; and that in entering on war, if a Christian nation, it must be able to appeal to the God of zight, and say that it is an appeal to Him, the supreme arbiter of law and justice. (Hear, hear.) Forany nation to maintain this it must in the first plaee be able to say that the war on which it haa entered is eminently just. Now, I have listened with thedeepest attention I am capable of commanding to all that has been urged in the course of this dobate, and I have not heard the unanswerable arguments of the noble and learned lord at the table (Lord St. Leonards) on this point taLen up by any speaker. The great principle laid down by the noble and learned lord, that it was not possible, according to the law of nations, for any one nation
by its own intersalregulations to take away the rights of am
independent Government over its own subjects, has neveryet been answered. (Eear, hear.) I am aware that thenoble and learned baron (Wensleydale) addressed himself tothis part of the subject, but I think he himself allowed that.
there were great'doubts in his own mind on many points connected with it (hear, hear), and that it was not altogether so very clear a case as has been assumed; m(H ear.) E
venture to affirm, though no lawyer, that in K, art o his. cas he will find few of his legal brethren tBgree with. him-when he said, for example, that before the Act or 1854 was passed there was no power whatever in a Colonial
Legislature to make such an ordinance as that which hasa undergone so much discussion in the present case. (Hear,.
lear.) The whole question, so far as the direct technicaL legality of the matter is concerned, turns on this-was thu. Arrow enttled or not entitled, t be called a British. vessel? Nowr, allow me on this part of the subjectto point to the 17th article of the supplemental treaty, where there - laid dowu. specific rules for enabling a shupto obhin a,
camtob lea itd s5lIt iS thprit
BowriXg itadumived she had strictly speaking, no sight to theBritish flpg, and yet on tte 12th, the day after, he wrote to COmm` oner Yeh, telling the commissioner, that he had violated she treaty in boarding the ehip because she c3rried the Xinglish flag. (Hear, hear.) Admiral Seymour, Sir
o,m Bowring, and Consul Parkes were a triumvirate selrssenting the English Government, but only the two latter -snew of that flaw in the indictment, and iet apteared the dndmil was never informed of it, for the House-would see 4at page 98 of the papers that after the wamiral had bombarded the town he wrote to the Admiralty that he had -done that, not to carry out the right to the entrance to the -city, but in consequence of the refusal of Commissioner Yeh to afford reparation in the case -of the Arrow. (Hear, hear.) Admiral Seymour doubtless thoutght he was vindicating the ,ightof the Arrow to carry the British flag, and he (the Earl of Malmesbxry) did not 'selievo that that gallant admiral, as an officer and a gentleman, would have fired upon the town if he had not positively believed this to be the case. Not only, therefore, did Sir John Bowring conceal the flaw in the indictment from the Chinese, which was dishonourable enugh, but he concealed it also from the -admiral on the station, whose duty it became to extort revartion for the alleged insult to the British flag, (Hear.)
me (the Earl of Maimesbury) had spoken as to the policy of int;sting such awful ;owers as thoas connected with the declaring of r in the hands of officils abroad without referenoe to the Government at home. Now as to the question of morality. On this point he would say that, even assuming the Arrow to be a British ship-British owned, British ootnmanded, British built, British from stem to utern-he denied that even this would afford any justification for the horrible proceedings adopted against the town. (Hear, hear.) The dignity of the British flag was to be vindicated. Now, he knew the dignity of the British flag was a magic phrase in either House of Parliament, or in any assembly of Englshmen. But in what didthat dignity consist, and how was it regarded ? It was looked upon as the emblem of liberty of civilization, and of the purest Christir.nity; as a symbol of great glory, of great nctories ; surroundee by a halo of everything which was honourable to this country, and connected with hopes for a future career still greater and stil more glorious. Did their lordships, however, believe that an ordinance of this sort would raise the prestige of the national flag7 (Hear, hear.) If that ilag were confided to the care of such people as those he had described, of whom there wvere 20,000 or 30,000 roaming about the Chinese seas, a great many of them being the very refuse and dregs of mankmd, vwas it nt almost certain that these men would dishonour the British flag and bring it into discredit? (Elear, hear.) What was the feeling entertained by the Chinese resecting our nfag? It was worth notice. Commissioner Yeh wrote
" I have always understood foreign flags to be each one peculiar to a nation; they are never made so little of as even to be lent; how then could a foreign nation do anything so irregular as to sell its flag to China? This ap. pears to your Excellency a proceeding in accordance with law; al I can say is, that I am not aware that foreign nattions have any such law."
(Cheers.) That was a sentiment worthy of a much more civilized man than Commissioner Yeh appeared to be con. sidered by the English authorities. (Hear.) That brought him to another point developed in this transaction,namely, that the existence of the ordinance was not known and understood by the Chinese; that, in fact, it was an ,E post facto law, rivetted on the treaty; and he did not Inow how such a lawv could be binding unless it were agreed to by both parties. (Cheers.) What, however, was the original cause of all these deplorable consequences? The first cause of all these misfortunes was the appointment of Dr., now Sir John, Bowring to the position which he now held. (Hear, hear.) If that gentleman had not been
yointed he believed, in opposition to what his noble Aned the Earl of Clarendon had said on this subject the other night, that the status quo would have been maintained, and that it would have lasted with proper care on both sides for a long time. It was to be remem. bored that our trade at Canton had more than doubled in ten years; and the insults so ostentatiously paraded as havy ing been offered to the British were no more than might be expected from a people so barbarous. What kind of man was it necessary under such circumstances for this country to possess as its representative there ? Her Majesty's representative at Hongkong, possessing, as he did, immense power, and having a great mass of business passing through his bands, should be a man of sound judgment, of great tact, of large discretion, and with a consummate knowledge of human nature. Now, he could state confidently that Sir John Bowing possessed none of these qualifications. (Hear, hear.) This was the practical question for them to decide,-ought Sir John Bowring to be left in this position? And he therefore regretted that his noble friend the Foreign Secretary had left the House, be. cause he should prove to their lordships that not only in this but in previous cases Sir J. Bowring had shown his incapacity for the post he at present held. In these very papers it -was shown that Sir J. Bowring had displayed indiscretion, aot only with regard to the Chinese, but in a still greater degree with regard to British interests, and in his dealings with his own coUeagues-the admiral and the consul. The admiral in one of his communications to Sir J. Bowring said:-
" The command of the river being now in our hands, I have no other operation in immediate contemplation be. yond the security and maintenance of our position; and it wil remain with Her Majesty's Government to determine whether the present oppoitunity shall be made available to enforce the treaty stipulations, which the Canton Govern. ment have hitherto been allowed to evade with impunity."
Wbat did Sir J. Bowring do upon receiving this intimation of the admiral's intention to remain passive and on the defensive ? With that vanity which was part and parcel of bis nature, he published in the Hongkong Gorernmont Ga. zette the whole correspondence betweeu himself and the admiral. From private letters it appeared that Admiral Seymour was highly incensed at this public disclosure of his intentions, and his fears were borne out, for six or seven days after the publication in this foolish Ga:ette of despatches which ought to have been kept zecret the Chinese took the offensive, and set fire to our factories. (EHear, hear.) This was not the only instance of Sir John Bowring's indiscretion. Three years ago, in 1854, Shanghai was taken by a mob of rebels, and at that time the confusion was so great, the displacement of all authority was so complete, that it was impossible to say to what autbo. nities the English merchants ought to pay Customs' duties. In this difficulty our consul suggested that English shipe should be allowed to clear out, he receiving bonds from the morchants to pay the dues in accordance with the directions of the English Government at home. The question was accordingly referred to the English Govermnient; but in the meanwhile Sir John Bowring was sent out as superintendent of trade in 'China. Sir J. Bow. ring then went to Shanghai, and said that he was .authorized to settle the whole business; that certain dues must be paid; and that he would open what he caUed a consular court to decide disputes. That proposal not bein satisfactory, he then made an offer, which was accepts
that he himself should be arbitrator. He would now, with the view of showing their lordships what confidence Sir J. Bowring inspired, read a pwage from a letter written by Mr. Adamson:-
" A short time previous to the receipt of Mr. Hammond's letter from the Foreign-office, Sir J. Bowring, by inducing a general belief that the British Government considered the dltties ought to be paid, and by asserting that he was intrusted with extraordinary and plenary powers to enforce them, had obtained from the merchants authority to arbi.
trato this question with the Chinese Governument. Upon the receipt. therefore, of Lord Clarendon's views, as communicated by Mr. Hammond, to the effect that no decision had been come to by Her Majesty's Government, the greatest surprise was felt, and the offers of compromise were subsequently withdravn, as they had only been obtained by' Sir J. Bowriing's reiterated assurances that the question was already decided, and the proceedinis noon such decision rested entirely with him. This Chamoer feels that the British merchants who signed the letter of compromise have been temporarily placed in a false position by their reliance on Sir John Bowring's representations, and it is anxious that Her Majesty's Government should be made aware of the circumstances under which the offer of arbitration was made, in the event of such offer being reported to the home Government to their prejudice What their views were of the justice of their cause, and of oth qualifications of Sir John Bowring as an arbitrator, is sufficiently shown by the remonstrance signed on the 8th of July, by the entire body of English merchants, with a solitary exception and it was only when they failed to induce his
xliency to pause that they aaally agreed to abide by his -decison."
Then, again, a deputation waited upon the Foreign Seere. tary, and what took place?-
" Mr. Gregson read to his Lordship a resolution this day passed, to the effect that Sir John Bowining's proceedings bad lost him the confidence of the merchants engaged in tne 'China trade and praying that in the approaching revisjon -of the-treaty JAer Majesty's Government might be represented by somne person of known experience and discretion. And it Was remarkedI by a imemiber of the deputation that either -the -powers with which Sir Joln Bowring had been intrusted were too extensive, or he had greatly exceededI their limits. Lord Clarendon replied, good humouredly, that it was less -than a year ago that he had been urged by a great meeting <at Manchester) to be sure and give Sir John Bowring sco
-enough-it could hardly be too much; and! as regarded Sir John Bowrng's exercise of the powers commAitted to him, ho assured the deputation that he (Sir Johbn Bowring) would -not be left in ignGrance of his (Lord Clarendon's) in-tentions about the securities, and that they (the -deputation) need have no apprehensions about his -errand to Pekin. NotUnlg could be more harm less to the
anterests of British trade than the objects_ to whjich he would there confine kiimelf. luat, in consequeaca of the Chinese -ComInissioner.at Canton Frofessing to have no authority to -investigate complaints or redress grievancas, things were
found to he literally at a deadlock, and Sir Joln Bo wring,
IW. Bourbillon, and MIr. LMane had, he really believed,
found it indispensa4le to pro6eed to Pokiin in persona, to get
iatters put to right& As to -tei renewal of the treaty, Sir John Bowiring would esake it ns part of his present n esiion to commit the British governmeut upon any one point of it; and he, Lord Clarenaon, wvould with pleasure undertake that nothing should be binaUy doas in it (the treaty) without direot communicatioi with the parties with whom he 'was then in conference."
The fact was that in 1814 the French bad a treaty with the 4hinese, and Englishmen had . rigb to be placed on the same footing. The French, tkeaty expired about that time, and therefore EDglish nier<hants 'were anxious to
have there as the British representat'ive r rean of prudence and discretion. How had Sir J. 13vowring displayed discretion 7 Why by placing the relations of the two countries in a state of the most utter confusion, &q if he wished to
tmpress upon the Government the opinion that he was the only man who could be heft in that country. He would not say anything with regard to the horrors comm,:tted upoa an ,;noffending population, but there could be no doubt that mnany )hinege had p'erished, while this country has incurred no loss ald gained no glory. The opinion of the 2ffi0ers engaged was fell illuetra.'.d in a letter which had *een shown to him, written hr a midshipman to h .
mother, in which the youn oficer wrote-" Do not
Ironble yourself about me; I am no' in any more danger tbsp ifEA were practising at an old tea-ctiidy." (A laugh.) jf xSir J. Bowring had been assoGStod with some
.11 discretion and prudence the cstaas<pheo might not
bave occurred, but unfortuxnately both the mnsn there were Entirely unfit for the positions they occuipied. If it were not for the horrors which had taken. pace in consequence of It, nothing could be more grotesque thian t'he conduct of Mr.
PSXIes IreSpct to these negotiations. Mr.. Parkes considered th2at1n eahad been unjustly seized, and insisted upon their being restored, and 10 of these men were sent back. Well, what did Mr. Parkes theaL do? Instead of accepting those 10 men he sent them back to prison. What could be more absurd I If it had beer a. debt-if Yeh had owed Mr. Parkes 12 1OZ.-notes and had sent him 10 of them, would Mr. Parkes have refused to accept them ? Was suchi treatment due to men who were called Englishmen? Here they had been sent back just an a man might send back goods which hie had bought from his grocer, because the weight was short. (Hear, hear.) But Mr. Parkes ought to have remembered that these people were human beings, and bad the claim of Englishmen to his protection. (EIear.) Ile mentioned this because it at once showed the' depth snd width of the intelligence of Mr. Park-es (hear. hear) ; and he should hope that Government would lose no tune in removing Sir J. Bowring and Mr. Plark-es fromapositions which they were so little competent to fill He ha no party feelings upon this subject, but his thought. had been fixed alone upon the two points to which he Ad alluded,-the immense danger of intrusting to officip5is abroad the power of waging war at their discretion, which was a question of policy ; and the question of humanitv
whether, supposing the iorchaL to have been a6 British %_i
from stem to stern, 'what took place on board of her could jutxify our representatives in the course which they had token. He felt that the character of this country with regard to its morality was at stake. Count Montalembert in a recent publication hadl exalted all the glories, while he had passed very lightly over the faults, Of our country; but he fcared that; in some future pages that great French writer would beunable to refrain from Pointing out with horror and disgust our proceedings throughouttibis transaction. There were several peers, including two or three right rev. prelates, who would be called upon to vote that night for the firt time upon a great and solemn question, and although no one had a higher reverence for the ties of party than himself, he entreated themn, when matters of conscience and morality were concerned, not to allow the ties of party to influence them too strongly. ThIs was notsana occasion which involved the fate of any
GoermenIt, n he therefore called upon noble lords for once to leave their party, and, following the dictates of their consciences, to support the motion of his noble friend. He dared not trust himself to express his feelings with respect to the proceedings subsequent to the affair of the Arrow . he had no language for such a subject, but, in the words of his noble friend who had addressed themi on Toceday night, he felt shame for his country. (Cheers.)
The Earl of A.LBEMARLE said that in tbe course of the discussion A distinction had been drawn between an English and a Chinese lorcha, and he noticed that whenever during the previous night's debate the word " lorcha" was used upon the Ministerial side of the Housete observation tro.
ceded from the opposite benches, " not an English lore a.$, After the able speech which had been made by his noble and learned friend (Lord Wensleydale) their lordships could have no doubt that the Arrow was an English lorcha; but, whether that were so or not, it was qutite certain thlat she couldl not be a Chinese lorcha. The Chinese had no such vessl, and they were forbidden byI law from havig a lorcha, which was a privileged class of vessel in. trodIucd by the Portuguese and adopted by the Europeans for convenience sake. A lorcha was a vessel of from 100 to 160 tons, and she waz completely European beth in hull and riggig. The register of a geuine Chiese vessel consisted mn her clumsy form, fromn which by law it could not deviate -it was the jusek, a specimnen of which their lordships might have seen a few years ago at Blackwall. The junk was supposed to represent a huge maarine animal-a monster ; it had a large maouth, formiidable teeth at the cutwater, two huge eyes to enable i~i to see with, and the high
stern formed the maonster's tail. All this was regulated by
law. By the law of China too the junk was obliged to carry nothing but square sails, and she mnust be painited a particular colour to denote the province to which she belonged. Thus a junk- was painted red in Canton, and green in the neighbouring province of Fokien. The lorcha had not only square sails, but fore and aft sails also;- she had neither teeth, eyes, nor tail, and that was the distinction. The very name was sufficient. Lorcha was a dissyllable, and the Chinese language had nota dissyllable in it. Their words were all mnonosyllables, and that proved that the lorcha could not be a Chinese veseL With respect to the legality of the registration, it was not necessary for a layman to pronounce an opinion, because he thoughit that nothing could be more satisfactory and convincing upon that point than the spech of his noble and learned friend oni the cross benches (Lord Wensleydale). If the converse were true, and the view taken by the noble and learned lord opposite (Lord St. Leonard's) was correct, he thought that a greater set of blunderers could not exist than those who had framed the I-mperial Act of 1834, because it wouldnomelyds franchise the colony of Hon kosg btt not merely distro
the property of Singapore and all our State settlements. He considered that the English representatives in China were jutfe naaighmsleo h nrto by the Chineee authorities of one article of the treaty to insist upon compliance with another article in it; and he came to that conclusion, not so much from a peruisal ofthe.papers on their lordships'table, which in his opinion made a very bad case out of a1 very good one, as from a consideration of the previous cndition in which we, in common with other European nations, stood towards that peculiar people, the Chinese. The time might have been' or might not have been opportune; but one thing was certain, that at no distsnt period a hostile collision with the Cantonese was inevitable, f or we had submitted to such frequent infractions of the treaty that the Chinese authorities were determined to heap every kind of indignity upon us, the extent of that indignitybeing only limited by the amnount of our forbearnce. (aear.) Our trade with China amounted to 15,000,0001. of imports, incluLding the trade with India, and about the same .amount of exports. The contribuLtion of one article alone -tea-to the revenue was between 5.000,0001. and 6,000,0001., to say nothing of upwards of 3,000,0001, to the Indian revenue, being one-si:xth of the whole of the revenue of that country. These were serious national concerns, and thAy were not lightl to be trifled with. (Cheers.) It might be sadtatteUinesehbad no interest in driving such good customers out of their country, and, as far as the Chinese people were concerned, he quite admitted that there was not a more mercantile nation in the world. Their love of trade was sogrent that they were ready to endure torture and death in order that it should be secured to them; but it was very different with the Tartar rulers of China, who were ever ready to pour indignities upon Europeans. He believed that Yeh, that vox popufi vex De! commissioner, would be ready to sacrifice the interests of the whole Chinese people if by so doing he could expel the outside barbarians from the country. (Hear, hear. He could ouly repeat that it was of the greatest possibleimportance that wve should have admission into Canaton, in order, if for no other purpose, that there should be a free parole communication between the authorities of the twvo ,countries. We were denied admission because, as Commissioner Yeh said, "the people are fierce and violent." He believed that the Tartar commissioner had taken care to makeo the Deople fierce and violent, and that much of their ferocity atid violence had arisen, from the false policy we had pursued in submitting to every kind of indignity they chose to cast upon us. (Hear, hear.) They had, in fact, a sort of hereditary contemlpt fOr US, Springing from this cause. He would give one or two instances of the sort of treatmeont they bestowed on Europeans. In 1822 a fire broke out in Canton, which consumed 70,000 houses, including the European factories, and destroyed 000,0001. worth of
roet,among which were 300,u001. worth of woollens.
MM 2 not paid duty, but the Chinese determiined that it should pay it, although the property was burnt. The supercargo petitioned tli ommoniissioner to be exempted from this impost, and the beginninig of the petition ran somewhlat to thlis effect :-" We, the supercargo, &c., beg to inform your Excellency that your slaves have lost 300,0001. worthx of woollens, anid that these woollens belonged to your slave, the barbarian Kinig of England", this barbarian King being the most renowvned gentleman of all Europe, his maost gracious Majesty George IV. (Hear.) A. Chinese was accidentally killed by a seamnan on board one of our shlips, end the Chinese authorities demanded that the mnan who had caused hiis death should be delivered up to them. This was evaded, kniowing that the certain conic. quences would be death to the unfortunate man. Trade was stopped asuruEa, and the supercai-goes wvere at their wits' end, when, Iluckily, the butcher of the Duke of York East Indiaman put an end to himself, and the English sent the dead body of the butcher to do d'uty for the supposed mnurderer. There was anothier case in point on board an American vessel :-A Chinese seaman was attempting to smuggle ardeiit spirits into the ship, when a seanman did something which caused him accidentally to tumble overboard. The Chinese authorities demnanded that the man should be given up, and the Americans, oni the express assurance that it was armere form, sent him ashore. They strangled him immnediattely, and senthis dead body bak to the ship. These were the sort of people we had to dleal with, jbat he submitted to the House whether British subjects' should be liable for accidental homicide to pay the penalty due to the commissionL of deoliberate murder ?

paper with the view of showing the general inspolicy of civilized nations entering into diplomatic relations with semi-barbarous communitie, and he intended to illustrate the bad effects of that system by Our relations with Persia. Into that ubject it was not his intention to go at the present mnoment.; hut he begged their lordships to remeiber that these relations with Persia had produe a endless bickeringa and two wars. We established diplomatic relations with Burmrab, and the consequence was that we were exposed to gross insults. Lord wihiam Bentnl aoc had the courage to do away with that establishment. He would say nothing of Dost Mahomeras. who very wisely preventedl us fron com mitting the great fonly of entering into diplomatic relations with hti, ando t YstipuIated that we should notinterfere with bisgoverv men . But otherinstances that could he quoted sank iuts3 insignificance when compared with the Chinese, for let tie House consider for a inoment what China was. China, according to themselves, was the Celestial Empire, and the Eusperor was the Son of Heaven. This title did not imply thak preternatural attributes belonged to that high potentate. 1t did not give him any divine rights, for there wag no heir presumptive to the throne in China. It was only part of tus, system believed in China, and meant that, as the ocoupant of the thn-one of China, he was by Divinea will the sole representative of supreme power in the world. (EHear, heair.) Hence 1,:ie inevitable deduction that the recognition of any other Powere on terms of equality was an iuspossihility; for the existence of this autocratic sysfe,n in China depended entirely on the assumption of immeasurable superiority. (Hear.) It was necessary to bear this in mindn, and hie hoped Her
sion, and one only. The Aubassador of Philip I. and his suiteawer passed from prson to prison, and considered themselves lueky to leave the Celeetial ity with a whole ekn. The envoys from Holland went prepared to conform ho everything req~uired by the Chinese. The Chinese certainly tasked their comnplaisanco in a very cruel and unreasonable manner. The historian thus described their treatment:.-
" They were bronght to the capital like mnalefactors, treated when there lke beggars, and then sent back to Canton like mountebanks, to perform the three times three prostration at all times and before everything their conductors thought fit."
The French had had the good sense never to send a formal mission to Pekin, and, therefore, escaping indignity, they had contributed I more information as to the Chinese than any other nation. With regard to England, he need not remind their lordships of Lord Macarthy's mission in 1792. It was before he was born. (Laughter.) It was a little before he was born. (lAughter.) But he was just able to remember a squib which, by tacking a line to one of Horace, deseribed the indignity suffered by the King's representative in a classical manner:-
" Impiger extremos currit mereator ad Indos,
"Pauperiem effugiens, multihm vapulandus in aulA "Tartarhxize
The expedition cost 170,000L, and the only effect it had was to impress the Chinese Emperor with the idea that it was a munifcent testimonial of unbounded respect from a feudatory towards his Sovereign. The English were treated as tribute-bearers and as barbarians, from whom greater allegiance was due than from any other ngtion. The way in which Lord Amherst was jostled out of the country did not prevent another expedition in 1837, when Lord Palmerston sent Lord Napier to endeavour to open direct communication with Pekin. Lord Napier did not open direct communication with Canton. The tide-waiters at Canton officiaUy reported, speaking of Lord Napier and his brother superintendents, that "three foreign devils" had arrived. Lord Palmerston directed Lord Napier to communicate by letter. But that would not do. "Foreign devils" might write petitions, but they must not presume to eend letters. Commissioner Loo first of all doubted whether he really was a bond fide officer, and added,-
"But even though he be really an officer of the said nation, he yet cannot write letters on an equalty with the frontier officers of the Celestial empire."
The refusal of the mission led to the last war, and, to prevent such a recurrence, he implored Her Majesty's Ministers to pay no heed to the suggestions contained in the bluebooks to send another envoy. Rumour had spoken of the offer having been actually made to some most distinguished statesman, and he wished to hear it denied. Without an armed force insult and indignity would be sure to follow, and another war ensue. With an armed force the case would be ten thousand times worse. We should degrade the Government, and, by degrading it, play the game of the insurgents. In fact, we should subvert the Chinese empire. (Hear, hear.) He did not think these remarks unconnected with the subject, because there was a disposition on the part of Her MIajesty's Mtinisters to interfere with the nternalrelations of almost every country in the world. (Cheers.)
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-I wish to be allowed to offer a few words to your lordships on this question. It is naturally one upon which I feel a very deep interest. It so happens that towards the termination of the last war with China, I, being then in India, officially co-operated with my noble friend who made the motion in preparation of the force required and in the direction of the efforts of our arms. The Whigs, with whom that war originated, knew neither how to conduct nor how to terminate it. (Cheers.) There was a change of Government, and in a few months it was terminated by the adoption of a totally different plan of operations with tho mostsignalsuccess. Everyobjectplaced before us as desirable was effected by the peace imposed on the Emperor of China. I did hope, my lords, that that peace might have lasted longer. (Cheers.) It gave us all we asked, and undoubtedly, during the early period which succeeded the completion of that peace, nothing could exceed the fidelity of the Chinese to their engagements. (Hear.) The manner in which they paid the enormous sum of 30 milions of dollars, which was extorted from them, is beyond all praise. It was beyond all expectation, and I think it shows, that had the Government continued actuated by tact, discretion, and judgment, as wel as firmness, amicable relations might stiU have been maintained. (Hear, hear.) My lords, we are told that sooner or later there must have been a contest with China. Then, I say, in God's name let it be at the latest period possible (cheers)-I say so in the strongest terms I can use, because, having conducted that war, I know the dreadful horror, with which it was accompanied-horrors, I believe, exceeding those in any previous war recorded in modern history; not proceeding from the conduct of our troops, but originating among the Chinese them. selves, the necessary consequence of the action of our troops, of the anarchy which that action produced, which Sir John Bowring knows must be produced now, and which will lead to the most dreadful calamities in every part of an empire containing more than 300,000,000 of people. (Hear, hear.) I do say the cause must be strong indeed which can justify any human being in venturing on a conflict which must be atcompanied with such dreadfulcalamities as these. (Cheers.) What is the cause in this instance? I will relieve your lordships at once from the apprehension that I shall go into any legal discussion as respects registers, ordinances, or any matters which nave occunied several noble and learned lords. We have heard noble and learned lords on both sides of the House, and there is no doubt every noble lord has made up his mind as to the legal points involved in the discussion, so that anything I might venture to say upon that matter would not have the slightest chance of altering their determinations. But this only I will say, that having carefully read all the papers, and carefully considered them, my firm impression is that there was no intended insult to the British flag. I say so decidedly, because although the flag may have been hauled down, the mandarins on board allowed the English master to rehoist it before they left the Tessel, and repressed the seamen who were disposed to use contumehous expressions towards the master, who happened nottobe onboardat the time theytookpossesx on of the vesseL That, my lords, is an indication that th'ere was no intention to insult the flag'; had there been the master would not have been allowed to rehoist it. However, that was considered by Dr. Bowring to be a sufficient excuse for proceeding to the extremity of hostilities. If that insult had rea'ly been offered in the manner which has been described-if it really was an intentional insult, is there one man present who will not say it has been abundantly atoned for'? (Hear, hear.) The forts along the whole course of the Canton river have been destroyed-not one stone remains upon the other; merchant vessels have been destroyed, war vessels have been destroyed, fire and bloodshed have been carried into an unoffending city-is not that enough for the offended dignity evenof this country-even of Dr. Bowring? (Loud cheers.) But in what manner does this representative of a benevolent Sovereign commence his operations? He commences a war against a vast empire with a force of 400 disposable men, with the knowledge that that force must dimi,nisb that he had no means of increasing it whatever might be the demands of the public service. Already one large vessel, the Winchester, by the orders of the Admiralty, has been sent home, but, unfortunately, from experience in the last war, I know that disease also will diminish the force already there, and that it is impossible that such diminution has not already occurred. But more than that, it must have been known that hostile operations once commenced they must extend to all the other ports of China. You must send ships to other ports. So he began a war of this kind with a force of 400 men with a certainty of that force being speedily diminished. Now, what has been effected in the course of three months? Nothing whatever to lead in the slightest degree to the settlement of the dispute-to the attainment of our object-to the restoration of tranquility, but much has been done to alienate the Chinese people. ( ear, hear.) Muchi has been done to render almost impossible the restoration of friendly relations with the vast population of Canton. (Hear, hear.) Much has been done to injure the national character, and for this Dr. Bowring was responsible-for this the Government have made themselves responsible; but for this I ask this House not to make itseif responsible. (Loud cheers.) My lords, Dr. Bowrinf might, if he had desired it, at a later Period, obtained the advantage of a personal interview with Commissioner Yeh-he might have employed his eloquence, which, however unappreciated by the House of Commons, yet, when translated into Chinese, might have been effectual with Commissioner Yeh. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) All these matters might have been discussed between Plenipotentiary Bowring and Commissioner Yeh. If Dr. Rowring considered that a desirable object, surely he might
nave been interrupted by the outcries of the populace, by volleys of musketry, by the Yells of those engaged in deadly couffict? But this mnut's monomania, as my noble friend (Lord Derby) has well termed it, led him to insist upon a public reception, and to decline a private interview, at which alone matters could have been satisfactorily discussed. ( ear, hear.) I dislike much at this
period of the evening having to tr espass upon yoarloo d shisini r espect to matters which have been already mentioned by my noble friends, but really I feel so Strongly the conflict between the words used by Dr. Bowring to Consul Parkes and those ho used towards Coimmissioner Yeh, that I can't forbear again pointing it out. (Hear, hear,) To Mr.. Consul Parkes h sa,"TeArwhad no righ to hoist the British fa"o mioer Yeh he says,
" "There is no d ob t the lorcha Arrow bore the B riahg." And that man remai s in office! (Loud dceers.) )The Secretary of State approves the cour se he has taken (continued cheering)casenseess an d puerile course, a vacillatin course

ships to consider under what circumstances Dr. Bowring thought fit, having obtained such aatisfaction as he had for the alleged insult of hauling down the British flag, to bring forward the additional demand for admission into the city and persnal communication with the officials of Canton. Not only was this the least fit and least auspicious moment for bringing forward that demand, but it was entirely contrryto the views he expressed in 1852 *-but if he had looked not only to the condition of Canton, DUt to Europe or to any part of Asia-to the interests of England in any part o' the v.orld-he wouldhaveseen t wasthe verylastnmoment to bring forwarda demand which hemust have known would haveled to the greatest conflictof negotiations, if not of arms. Dr. Bowring knewv that well enough, for he has stated ih his letters the financil importance of the trade with China. Hie states the amont of duties received by England and India to be abott 9,G00,000l. But that is a small part of the value of that trade. (flear.) There is the whole value of the trade itself. Stop that trade with China and yon stop the most material exports from the whole of our Indian empire. You make it more difficult if not impossible, for the poor ryot to pay his rent to the Government. But it is not only in India that the effects of any interruption of our trade with China would be felt. It is a great link in our whole chain of commerce. I remember that the cotton of America, the staple of our greatest manufacture, is paid for by bils ugon England. Those biUs are taken by the Americans to Canton, where they are paid away for tea. The Chinese give them to the opium merchants, by whom they are taken to India,there exchanged for other commodities, and they furnish ultimately themoneyremittances of privatefortunes, andthe funds for carrying on the Indian Government at homae. I do not state these as peculiar circumstances
but as iUustrating the fact how the breaking one link in the chain of commerce affects, not only the country with whom the rupture takes place, but the commerce of every part of the world even the most remote. But Dr. Bowring could not have heen ignorant of the orders which had been issued for the preparation of a force in India for the purpse of carrying on warlike operations in Persia. Ve had just terminated one war. He must have known the great difficulties under which the finances of England laboured, the weaklness of the European forces, and the enor. mous effort of removing those forces beyond seas; and he must have felt that to commence another war at a distance of many thousand miles from this country, and to feed it with troops from the same country immediately after the con. clusion of a great European war, would be an enterprise in the last degree replete with difficulty and hazard. What we most desre is peace, and not war; and we did not desire, having just termmated a war in Europe, to have two wars in Asia. This war, then, we owe to Sir J. Bowring alone. But, my lords, I say there was a still higher obligation than any arising out of the consideration of our mere financial difficulties and our miltary position in Asia. He must bave known thoroughly the position of the empire of China. It has greatly deteriorated during the last 12 years. Rebellion now prevails in many parts of the country, and I recoUect when I was conducting the war in 1842 that if the continued pressure of affairs which then prevailed had lasted only four months more the effect would have been to dissolve the Government in all the maritime parts of China. The time must come, looking at the condition of China, when there will be operated in that country a very great, general, and, I fear, a sanguinary revolution. I leek forward to it as a necessity, but I deprecate that necessity. But, my lords, let us keep our hands clean; let us not in any manner be ancillary to the bringing on of so dreadful a calamity in that country. (Cheers.) There is another consideration, my lords, and it is one of great importance. There can be no doubt whatever that of all the countries in the East China is that of which the condition is the most favourable to the introduction of Christianity; and in China there is every reason to hope that by judicious measures the Christian religion will be disseminated at no distant period. My lords, how are we to present ourselves to the people of China as those who are to introduce a religion of mercy, of benevo. lence, of virtue, and of truth (cheers), if they see our own Minister violating three of the commandments in the Decalogue, committing murder through an unjust war, not saying that which is true with respect to his neighbours, and acting throughout with no motive whatever but that which is denounced-general covetousness and the desire of making money by the misfortunes of mankind? (Loud cheers.) My lords, it is not safe to assume the tone of bullying the weak (cheers); least of all is it safe, when we have not the pruaent precaution or the spirit to make ourselves strong at home, to undertake foreign operations of a dangerous nature without adequate preparations and without adequate means, Depend upon it, the punishment will come. If it comes not to us on account of our dereliction of the ordinary principles on which nations should be governed, such events as those which have recently taken place cannot for ever escape punishment from Above. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I must say I most deeply regret the little consideration which Eeems to have induced the Government on this occasion to adopt a course so inconsistent with the character of the country. How could they for a moment hesitate to remove from office a man who has shown the ferocity of a Nadir Shah by the side of the miserable and wretched policy of a clerk in a counting-house. (Cheers and lasghter.) My lords, it is for us to vindicate this House from agreement with lIer hiajesty'a Government, and from following in the wake of Dr. .Bowring. I trust the HIouse will by its vote to-night protect us from the further prosecution of a war which is at once a folly and a crime. (Loud
Earl GRANVILLE.-M7 lords, when the noble earlwho has just sat down began his speech with that magnificent denunciation of the horrors of war to which the Chinese war bears testimony I thought he was going to avoid what appears to me to be a deep stain in the otherwise able and distinguished speeches which have been made on the other side of the House during this debate. I think, my lords, it would have been desirable that he should not have fol. lowed the example set him by every possible exaggeration, by every possible tone of voice, by every possible means of ridicule, even descending to the constant introduction of the word "Doctor," to hunt down a man who, whether he is right or wrong, deserves, at all events in a great discussion like this, to have his conduct seriously and dispassionately reviewed. (Loud cheers.) Criticize if you like, but do not appeal to such feelings as have been addressed in order unjustly to prejudice a public servant. The noble earl is the first of your lordships who has taken part in the debate who has put the question of to-night on the proper footing. He has stated that it is an attack on the Government. (Hear, hear.) Of course it is. TheGovernment, not hastily, ashesays,butafter due consideration-after weighing the facts of the case-after having consulted as to the legality of the acts and the future consequences of disowning what has taken place, have come to the resolution of entirely supporting their subordinate abroad, and in so doing they take upon themselves the whole responsibility of the acts of the three English representatives of the Governmentat Canton. (Cheers.) I shall go through as shortly as I can the facts of the case under consideration, but without having recourse to any appeal to your lordaships' passions; and I hope you will listen to the plain, probably dul, statement I have to make. The first event to which I shaU take the liberty of alluding is this. It was clearly laid down that the real question at issue was divisible into two points-that is to say, was the British flag flying on board the lorcha when she was boarded by the Chinese, and, if so, was that flag entitled to be there? Now, I own I was never more surprised them to hear some of your lordships, professing to take a perfectly impartial view of this question, and e3pecialy my noble friend (Earl Grey), state the opinions you have as regards the fact of the flag being hoisted or not.
Earl GREY.-What I said was this :-The point was immaterial. There was a doubt upon it, and so far as I had an opinion upon the matter from the papers before me, I thought the flag was not flying.
Earl GRANVILLE.-I had certainly understood my noble friend to express an opinion the other way. What is the evidence we have upon this question? Con. siderable stress has been laid upon Commissioner Yeh's statement that it was not the habit of English ships to hoist the flag of their nation when in a particular position in the harbour, and noble lords said triumphantly that Sir John Bowring had never answered this statement. Now, it appears from the depositions that this vessel was on the point of weighing anchor, that the blue peter was up, which I believe is the signal for that act, and this, therefore, entirely disposes of the anomaly to which allusion has been made. So much for indirectevidonce. When I come to direct evi. dence I hive that of two of my fellow-countrymen- one of whom (I don't knowv why) two noble lords opposite have chosen to call the nominal master-
The Earl of DERBY.-I called him so because he apphes that very term to himself in his own statement to Mr. Parkes. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GRANVILLE.-These two men, being distant about 150 yards from the lorcha, state on their oaths that they saw the flag pulled down by the Chinese mandarin. Their
evidene is corroborated by a Chinese sailor on hoard the
Arrow- and what is the evidence adduced on the other sido? "ou have the deposition of a Chinese sailor-a criminal, bound under the orders of that Commissioner Yeh, who has been made a perfect idol of bynoble lords opposite (hear, hear), but of whom no idle story (alausgh) is told when il is said that he has boasted of putting to death 70,000 of his fellow-countrymen. Do you suppose that a criminal, bound and in tho hands of such a monster as this, would be likely to give ver,y free aDd independent evidence? (Hear, hear.) But It is said that tho deposition of this criminal is corroborated by the evidence of the Chinese mandarin himself. Now, my lords, I trust that I am not more imbued with prejudice against foreigners-whether Orientals or Europeans-than other noblemen in this Housme but I do think noble lords can hardly seriously maintain that in their belief the Chinese authorities are tobe trusted in assertions of this kind. (Hear.) I beg you to consult the statements of every missionary, whether Englsh or foreign, upon this point. Go back to the history of our embassies. What happened to Lord Napier? The authorities pretended that they were going to treat him with great honour, and carried a flagbefore him in procession, magnificently emblzoned with letters of gold, pur,orting to represent his name and style, but which really signified " Tribute bearer from the outer barbarians, come to apologize for the faults and errors of his country." (Laughter.) Do you believe that there is a Chinese maudarin who thinks that a story of that sort, invented to gull
their own people, involved any immorality ? But if you are so Inclined to distrust what is stated by your own officils on this occasion, I will read to you what is the opinion of the American consul as to the value of Chinese assertions. It is con-ained in a HDngkong newspaper lately received:-
"T'o the Mlerchants and other Citizens of the Usnited
r"Agatifnof the United States, Macs, Dec. 27, 1856. His Excelk'ncy Peter Parker, Commissioner of the
'every such vessel shall report herself at the Boeca Tigris' zand wheu she carries cargo she shall report herself at "AYhamy.", and shall on reaching Canton deliver up her 'salling letter or register to the British Conisul, who will olh. tain permission from the Hoppo for her to deliver 'hier cargo, and so on. Now, there is not the slightest evi. -deuce that this step ever 'was takern by this lorcha. It has :Dovor been mentioned that permissioni was asked or obtained
-forn the R{oppo to discharge her cargo, and it follows
'that if she was such a vessel as she is said to be she
iad not fuliaued the regulations of the treaty, so that it was impossible the Chinese could suppose that she 'bad any claim to the character of a Britishi vessel. '(Hear, hoar.) This first point, then, remains wholly aI'prll, nd if it he unproveni the concliusion is undeniable 'thatin Vthe sight,, of God and man we have entered on an unjust war. (Hear, hear.) Bnt I say furthier, that to justify any ma,acording to the rules of civilized and Christian
natios ti necessary not mierely that you should be able lehial o prove a ground of justice, but that that *gron ofJustice should be so broad and so palpable -as that it shiall be easily and plainly apprehended. j Hear, hear.) Can any one say in this case there 2s such a broad rule of justice? Can we say, now -that we have all the facts before us, and after the event has occurred, that there are no doubts as to there being a suffi-clent basis on which a Christian nation ouight to go to war? '(Hear, bear. ) But there is another c,,udition to which I maust allude. Not only must the justice of our cause be -plain and appreciable, but the msatter for which you go to
'war must he in itself such as will fully justify youxr having 'recourse to so sad an extrcmitiy. (Hear.) An attempt has been 'naado to show that the honour of the British flag was at stake, and .ve have heard rauch in the wav of appeal to our Joyalty on bthalf of that flag, which ne;ver suiffered an insult. But 'what was the matter in dispute? 1)d Commissioner Yeh claim a right to haul down the English colours? Did -lie claim a right to seize a British lorcha protected by a 'license or register? No such thing. He said, on the -contrary, that the C hinese Government would not ,follow foreigi -vessels to take Chinese subjects out of 'themn; therefore it came to be a simnple question of fact, "whether any right whatever was attempted to be violated, 'Trhe Chinese Goverinment was ready to say that if any right 'lad been violkated an apology would have been made for it, buxt none would be made, as the Arrow did not come under the c=racter 'which called for such a concession. I ask whether, even if an injury had been committed there were sufficient grounds for seniding inisery and destruction among nijilinns of the Chinese people. (Hear.) Ought -a simple difference on a matter of this kind to have been held sufficient among Christian mien to p ug -this nation into a destructive war with the empire of China? (Hear, hear.) But there is still another condition on which -alone'war is delensible. It must be waged only afterbhaving bad recourve to those formalities which in all civilized nations go before any act of war. (Hear.) 'What mean those heralds trumpeting forth the defiance of one nation 'to another ? (Hear.) Are they nothiing more than the
ainted paeant of a dream ? (Hear.) There are grest truths Tu"rukioitheseformalities.Civiiisedna6tions havelaidlidown -as a rul that without giving the nation they are about to -attack the fullest notice, and withouct affording it the oppor. nity of reconsiderirng all the matters in dispute, they are not justified in ruhing into all the horrors of war. -SHear.) Bat how stand the case here? The blow has meen struck secretly and unknown to the Government of 'the nation we have attacked. Care was taken to hide 'from the Chinese what was intended to be done, and it is worthy of remark that the plenipotentiary of Great Britain did not come up himself to the scene of wa-rfare be. -~cause he was anxious not to give the slightest intimation of
'what -was about to be done. (Hear, hear.) Through a 'headstrong consul and a thoughtless plenipotentiary you have been drawn into a great 'war with one of the most populous niations onearth. (Hear, hear.) I say, therefore, that you wvent the element of justice here also ; and I say further that 'whatever difficulties you mnay be in.
~vovd in, if it can be shown tlsat You have comn-sntted wrong, youL have butt one duty to perform, and that is to retreat from that wrong. (H ear, hear.) I think I can show in a single niosnent you have still oppRortunity of withdrawing from further pro. -cedure in this course of iniquiity without danger to the counitrv-n3ay, I believe y-ou wilb nurnng aside the great dangers that are before You, because the one -thing needful is that the gu,Ilt cause of this evil shall be marked by this nationy as being the gaUity -cause; sand, that having been done, this nation as a nation, with that nation as a nation, cani enter .into the necessary commnuni--ations for Adjusting the quarrel. I say-and I venture to say, even ;after what has fallen from the nioble carl, that every page of these papers does, to niy mind, as an unprejudiced reder, show that Sir J. Bowring is the guilty cause of this war. (Hear, hear.) I do not wish to press upon one distant undue 'cenmnre, but justice requires, if I believe it, that I -should state ic. (Hear, hear.) I cannot for a moment ad' mit that Admiiral Sir Michael Seymiour stands on the samie -footing as Sir J. Bowring, and I do complain, in justice to the navy, if any words spoken in this debate seem to implicate lsir M1. Seymour in the same guilt as that -which attaches to Sir J. Bowring. The Government -have not twld us that Sir M. Seymiour ever saw all 'the previous correspondence. We do not know-I have every reason to believe the contrary-that Sir LI -Seymour was aware that theBritish representative had been 'charged by successive Administrations not to get into-this -quarrel. (Ulear, hear.) I 1-iow Sir Li. Seymour to be not -only a most gallant, but a miost humiane officer. I know that even in this miserable matter in which Sir J. Bowring involved himi he studied as far as a snan in his position -could study the interests of humnanity. (Cheers.) Therefore, I cannot bear to hear Sir MI. Seymour charged unfairly with the g-eat guilt which attachEs' to the plenipotentiary. -(Cheers.) In mny opinion even Mir. Consul Parkes is in nn inferior degree guilty in this miatter, because Consul Parkes was brought dLay by day into the cenitre of quarrels 'with the Chinese; and he must have been more than human if he did not feel somewhat of a sore anid irritable temper in -dealing with thiem. But what is the purpose of a plenipo. 'tentiar seated at Hongkong but to repress these ebulltitoas
-f feeling, anid to inculcate calminess, caution, and prudence ? It is his duty not to take up so ho',tile a position but to remnember that he is the representatives of a great -empire, of a great Sovereign, of a great-, benevolent, and Christian enipire and Sovereign ; to put up with anything 'wlich does not abwolutely endanger the honour of the country; and, if he sees that honour endangered, to be careful and make no demand from 'wlih ichh cannot conveniently retire or justly persevere in. Therefore, neither Sir AL. Seya.our nor Air. Consul Parkes, but Sir J. Bowring -seems to meo to be the offender. (Cheers.) If, I say, in the. sight of heaven and in thesight of nations, he is the offender, 'either throcgh bad judgment or bad management, or, as I think, through being possesse of that one ffixed idea which certainly approaches whati the noble earl calls monomania, which does make a man more dangerous in every single relationi of life than almost any other constitution of mind-when a man in that strange way assimilates every. 'thing that can be suggested to him and everything he can do with one fixed fancy", which pervades him day and nipht-when every id"a is turnedl and twisted, and every. -thing looks small and insignificant compared with -the carrying out one favoured proiect,-if, as I believe, actingg i a very narrow mind-a mind natuirally cra.mped,mreorycapd very smiall and inexpan-
ivdawn, peirhaps, by the contiguity of China into additionial conitraction, monomania has led him into guilt,-if this man is -guilty, mainly fromn intelectual faults, hut also fromi grievous moral faults (for he seemis never to have -appreciated the crinme and evil of the bloodshied and misery he was cau~ing),-if, I Pay, he is the forefront of this 'ntional guilt, the Government is bound to recal him ; and ,the resolutions ought to have, and, taken up as I trust they
'will be by the people of the land will have, the effect of ieading to the reca of that most unhappy funo'tionary. (Cheers.) If I have shiown the reason why this war is an unjust war, and how we may yet escape from tlie evils in which it has en. -tangled us. I do ask your lordships for a single moment to weigh what is the real amount of guilt and what are the probable circuinetasices and puniishmienlt whichi will follow a -continuance in such a course. In the first place, only remiember the great guilt of the stronger ilation oppressing the "weaker.
The Duke of ARGYLL.-'What ! 35,000,000 against 200,000,000?
The Bishop of OXFORD.-Yes,-it is jutst the great -population of that country which constitutes its weakness. ,It is like the wolf attacking the flock of sheep-thLe more numerous the greater the slaughter. You speak of Canton as -in some degree afortified city, but it isnot so. It is amere -congeries of habitations, -wholly indlefensible against the maodern arts of war. It is a special necessity that the warfare 'to he waged against China should be a wholesale slaughter of the unoffending memnbers of that empire, through which wyholesale slaughter you will seek to acet -upon the Governmeut. Evil as war is when. you -go against arnides, it is nothinig as consipared with tightinigthe Chinese in this way. And what is ityouthops.? You ho~pe to produce an effect upn the Government. aut is itlikely toimm4sioner Yehwll beoallscted by your kill. iug the Ciiinese when he is said to be a iuan so careless of human life' that, lie has himnself kill.d 70,000 Chinese ? Do you hope to turn him (reon his obstinacy by killing a few more thousand of them? !(Rear.) I say again because Etu5lAnd is so strong and becauAe Chin is so weak your guilt is great. Why is it that Englanid is strong and 'China is we;k? England is strong because she is Christian. -a ruc_nnZ.i wea beas hete,,n haIete ot h
and China is wezak because hahui._ a ae u h 3eart of miianhood in her. (Cheers.) Tbere was a time when your Plant genet Princes could hardly write their own name legibly, who,i China was in a high state of literary excellence. Aud how is it that England is -vhat England is now and China what China is? It is b,cause Christianity has raised a Iiigeh moral tone in England, and in raising that high moral tonie has elevated the people and given them superior stre-.g'h. See, then, what you are doinig. Having received this gift from God, with the trust which accomdpanies Christianity, you are using it for what? For brinzing misery, depopulation, waste, suffring, and a muhitude of evils which attend on war, upon a nation 'which h,s given no just cause of offence, simply becanso ),ou have that strength, because it is possessed by that weakanes. (Cheers.l There is but one more reason. It is hardly possible for any reasonable man to doubt that this power is given to do G.d's word-to Chris-tianize these feebler populations. Wlhy is it that power accompanies Christianity, and weakness the want of that blessing ? WVhy is it, but that the strong should give to the weak this greatest boon ? and your ,special wrongdoing is that you are making it almost Anext to i possiblethat you can be the ineans of conveying Christianity to that great empire. Do not for a moment believe tha4phe Chinese are unobservant witnesses of these, your eontr tIAVtions. It was but a few years ago that you vers taunted by them-" How can we believe that yoa wish to introduce Christianity 'when you aro the great importers of opium?' Do they not taunt you now, "Youprotess to serve the spirit of Heaven, but are thesethe dictates -of Heaven's Spirit?" Is it not true witness these papars bear when they tell you commissioners are changed, men ian mpower pass ay, but dwellers in a city are represented in 'the next generation by children and grandchidren, who live to cherish the records of yoar crime ? (Cheers.) [ say for siU these reasons I earnestly hope this great Christian, judicial s well as legisWatorial assembly, will indeed
pause before they are led by a taunt of supporting,
a partY motion to throw their weight into the scale of injustice and wrong. Srre I am, my lords. that whatever dangers may threaten to accompany & back ward step, they are nothing compared with the dangers which accou.pany continued wrongdong. I do not be,lieve in the greatness of the dangers from the Chinese. I do Dot believe they are possessed of any great ,ense of their own power and your weakness. 1 believe they are thoroughly possessed with the idea that we are riser, ssrongLr, anLd more capable than themselves, an. need no frtsh teaching of this most unhappy kind. But, nmy lords, there is a Power against which you are parading the strength of England if you persist knowingly iu a course of wrong, and that Power never will permit self-willed strength cruelly to assert its right to the wrong and despite of the wretched victims of tyranny. (Hear, hear.) You are gting agairst a Power which knows in its own time to work its own purpo?es, which never fails to iisit the wrong-doing of the oppressor, and never leaves a WrODg unaven;ged. It is not for me, my lords, to prophesy how such puiln,ent may cosne. I may see dark clouds gathering in tie distaiice; I may believe I see the thi eatening clkud- eve:. hear the mutterings of the thunder. El gland's Iiight- England's supremacy at sea-her atseltion of it- are not favourably regarded in any part of theworld. IDeendupon it, the appalling example of our attemptin-g in our strength to stamp upon a defenceless and unofflroling raco the impress of our own lawless policy will not pass u;obberved in Europe, in Asia, or in America, nor withnut concentrating against you the just hatred of other pe .pIe. Depend upon it, too, there will be some mode in wlhich will follow the judgment of that Power which overlook, niot tbe smallest or least considerable objects -which causes the sands of the desert to be borne upon the wings of the wind to form a bar to the ragiDg of the sea. That Power will fintd a way to show the weakness and rebuke the pride and strenigth of Britain. (Hear, hear.)

The Late Southampton Election.-Southamp-
THE LATE SOUTHAMPTON ELECTION.-SOTTHAMPToNi, ThnurSday.-lt is generally rumoured, and understood to be true, that a petition against the return of Mr. Weguelin has been forwarded to London this morning, by the half-past 11 o'clock train, to be presented to the House of Commons this evening. This course was finally decided on) at a ineeting of SirEdward Butler's snpporters, held yesterday evening at the Dolphin Hotel. The alegations on which the petition is based are stated to be-that one or two of the Dolling-booths were torn down by the people a few minutes before 4 o'clock, that one of the returning officers adjourned the proceedings at his booth for half an hour in the middle of the day, that the sheriff is the sole returning officer ; and rumour asserts that bribery is also alleged in the petition. There is a very strong feeling among the moderate politicians of all classes against the peace of the community being again disturbed, and the town once more plunged into the angry turmoils of an election contest upon nothing stronger than mere legal technicalities. which could in no way have affected the result of the late election.
THE ROYAL BRTISII BAxx.-Yesterday afternoon, at half-past 3 o'clock, the Attorney-General received a deputation, consisting of Mr. James Wyld, chairman of the Committee of Deposicors of the Royal British Bank; Mr. Robert Taylor, Mr. B. Foster, 31r. G. J. Kain, and Mr. A. Fulkes, members of the committee; Mr. John Linklater, solicitor for the assignees ; and Mr. IT. Freshfield, Mr. Coverdale, Mr. Reed, Mr. E. Lawrence, and Mr. Field, solicitors for shareholders. The object of the deputation was for the purpose of calling the Attorney-General's attention to the anomalous state of the law with reference to the bankruptcy and winding-up of joint-stock banking companies, writh a view to protect shareholders from being entirely ruined by numberless actions, and to enable assignees, on behalf of creditors, to enter into compromises. The Attorney-General fully concurred in the views of the deputation, and promised to speak to the Lord Chancellor and the Vice-President of the Board of Trade on the subject of a Bill to be brought into Parliament to remedy the defects in the law. The deputation withdrew, after thanking the learmed gentleman for the kind manner in which they had been received.
FATAL ExPLosIoN.-Yesterday morning, about half-past 10 o'clock, the whole of the extreme eastern portion of the metropolis was startled by a terrific explosion at the fog-signal factory of the Eastern Counties Railway, adjacent to the works at Stratford. So severe was the shock as to aflect every habitation within a radius of two or three miles. For some time the company have been in the habit of manufacturing their own fog. signals. Up to within the last two years or so the work was dcne in a portion of the principal bnildings, bat, in consequence of the vesy explosive cbaracter of material employed in the manufacture of the signals, and the peril in which the whole of the extensive works were placed, a separate building was erected for the factory some 40 feet fronm the main premises, fronting the Cambridge line. The storekeeper had the superintendence of it, and it is stated that the company adopted every precantion for the protection of the workpeople. Most providentiaUly, only two of them were in the bullding when the catastrophe took
ae; tbey were William Beckingham, a labourer, and Von Jackcson, a lad, both employed iD the factory, and in the company's service. They were engaged in the process, it is supposed, of packing the signals when they exploded with terrific force. Toheroof and wal of the building, which was a substantial brick one, were literally blown into fragments, scarcely a portion of the structure being left in its original position. A large number of the company's workpeople were immediately on the spot, and as soon as practicable, search was made for the poor feUows wbo were known to have been in the factory. The remains of Jackson, the lad, were found to be sadly mutilated, al his clothes being nearly burnt off, The fbody of *Beckingham was also much disfigured. Both of the unfor. ienate men were, no doubt, instantly killed. The body of another sufferer was also found. It was that of William Beckwith, a blacksmith, living at Stratford. It appears that he was in the act of crossing a field on the opposite side of the line when the explosion occurred, and he wes struck on the head by a piece of brickwork and killed on the spot. A brother of the unfortunate man, George Beck. with, was walking with him at the time, and he was seriously injured through being struck by Fome of the fragments of the demolished factory. In another part of the place George Irons, a company's servant, was found to be much hurt. There were also two or three others injured. Medical assistance was promptly procured for them, and the poor fellows were removed to the London Hospital, where they remain in a cad way. It is a most fortunate circumstance that a train was not pasSiDng along the Cambridge line at the moment of the explosion; had there been, most deplorable consequences must have ensued, for the train would have been exposed to the full shock. As it was, a train was on the oPposite (Colchester) line, standing at the Stratford-station, and so great was the concussion as to throw the passen-ers from their seats. The cause of the explosion is at present a matter of conjecture. Several of the company's offcials have instituted an Inquiry into the l tle event but nothing of a satisfactory nature ha transpired. It is believed however, that there must have been a large stock of sigoalsin the building. Much damage wasd done in the breaking of glass, &c., to the adjacent buildings and stores of the company. The bodies of the sufferers were rernsoed to a neighbouring tavern to await a coroner's inquest.
EDINBso RGH AGr NtNITY TAx.-In conmexion with the Bi for the repeal of the Ministers' Money in Eight Towns of Ireland, the second reading of which has been fixed for the 18th of Mfarch, the case of the Edinburgh Annuity Tax wil again be brought before the House of Commons. This tax, which amounts to 4 per cent. on the rack rental of aln the property of the city within the extended royalty, and is levied on occupants, goes to mraintain 18 city niiniaters, who each receive from the tax 5.501. to 6001. a-year. From time to time the tarx has caused great agitation in the city o even magistrates and other respectable citiz,ens professing voluntary opinions
bave gone to gaol rather than pay it, and the forcible arretment of the goods of others on one occasion led to rioting and the caling out of the military. Committees of Parliament have sat upon the question, Parliamentary commidssioners have held inquiries, and various measures ofrelief to the city have been proposed, but as yet nothing has been done. Mr. Black, M.P. for the ity, has ad an interviewwith Lord Palmerston, and stated the grievance to him, and the question has been brought under the notice of other niemben of Government, with the aiew that, as Edinburgh stands in substantially the same position in this matter as the Irish towns, the same measute of relief should be extended to it. Theo Bishops'eteindsf " inh ossession of the Crown ince he abolition of episcopacy in Scotland, have been pointed to as a proper source to give relief. The Edinburghsr Town-Council has unanimously resolved to petition Parliament on the subjec.o. A similar tax exists in the neighbouring burgh of Caongateo and in the town of isntrose, in behalf of which the sahe claim will be presented.
ATTEiMTED MURtDER OF A WAiRDER.-AnI attempt at murder was made last Saturday afternoon by Thomas Gorwan. a prisoner in Reading Gael, on one of the warders, named Brewer. There are stated periods for the prisoners to be taken from their cells into the exercise-yards; and at about 2 o'clock on the afternoon inoquestion Brewer was engaged in openityg the doors of the cells in the upper coIr. dor, wvhich is approached by flielits of iron stairs, and had let the prisoner German out. Unfortunately, the warder did not adopt the usual precautiot of seeing each prisoner walk in front of him fi he left the cells,. ebuthe passed from cell to cell on unlocking the doors.Germana ig a ticket-of-leave man, having left the convict establishment aLt Portsmoutth in January last, hut he committed a robbery in Reading on the following day. and was commritted for trial at the forthcoming assizes. No sooner had the warder unlockced the door than Gorman stepped out briskly, and struck him a severe blow on the hackc of the head with a brush, which, from the force, brolce into -pieces and fell into the lower part of the gaoL. He in. atantly ran back into his cell and fetehed a three-legged stool to renew his attack. The next prisoner, observing the violence of Gormnan. and fearing imminent danger to the warder, who was stunned by the first blowr, naught hold of bhim, took him into his own cell, and closed the door, to protect him from further vlo!ence. Fortunately, after a little timie, sufficient asistance was obtained to overpwer
German, and he was secured. He was questionedl byL the
governor as to his motive for such conduct, but he wouldnot say nytingmor thn tat e wuldkill Brewer on the

AMVERIOA.
LIVERPOOL, THuRsDAY.
The Canard screw steamship Alps (of the Havre and New York line) arrived this morning from New York with advices to the 14th inst. and $3,150 specie on freight. She has also brought the mails intended for the UJnited States' steamship Baltic, which vessel remained in New York for repairs. The Alps made the run from New York to Liverpool in 11 days 11 hours. Her outward passage from Havre to New York was made in 12 days 17 hours.
The screw steamship City of Manchester has also arrived from New York, whence she sailed on the 12tlh ult.
The City of Baltimore, hence, arrived at New York on the 12th inst. The Europa, hence, at Halifax on the 14th inst. The Anglo Saxon, hence, at Portland, on the 13th.
The Cunard Company will despatch the Alps on Wednesday next, the 4th of March, the day on which the UTnited States steamship Baltic should have sailed with the mails.
The Senate had taken part with the House of Representatives in opening and counting the votes for President and Vice-President of the States. The event, says the WVashington correspondence of the Jous7Xl of Commerce is not without' interest and dignity even upon an occasion when, happily for the peace of the country, there was neither doubt nor dispute as to the choice of the people as expressed through the electoral colleges. It says the time may come when again, as n 180I, there might arise a serious dilliculty in carrying out the purposes of the constitution. Though one source of danger -was removed by a constitutional amendment, others might be imagined as of possible development in case of a close and doubtful result of a Presidential election coinciding with an inflamed condition of the popular mind. Upon the return of the senators from the House, the teller of the Senate reported the result of counting the electoral votes, and added the fact that the electors of Wisconsin had not assembled, and cast the vote of that State till the day after the time prescribed by law. Mr. Weller offered a resolution that a committee, to consist of one member of the Senate and two members ofthe House, be appointed to inform Messrs. Buchanan and Breckenridge of their election. Mr. Crittenden moved an amendment, in substance that the vote of Wisconsin ought not to be included in the list of electoral votes, and that any member of either House had the privilege to object to the counting of said vote; and that it was competent for the Senate and House alone to decide that question. Pending the question an adjournment took place.
In the House of Representatives Mr. Barbour had moved the reconsideration of the vote by which the Senate Submarine Telegraphic Bill had been referred to the Committee on Post-offices. Mr. Washburn, of Maine, under the instruction of the Committee on Elections, had reported that John W. I Whitefield was not entitled to a seat in the House as the delegate from Kansas, and moved that the further consideration of the subject should be postponed until the Saturday following. Mr. Oliver, of Mobile, moved to lay the resolution on the table, and made a minority report, and asked for the memorial of Mr. Whitef6eld in response to the report of the majority of the committee read. The proceedings in reference to opening and counting the votes of the electors of the several States for President and VicePresidentwere commenced by thePresident announcing their object and stating that theywerepursuant to la;v and in obedience to the concurrent orders of the two H ouses. When the certificate from Wisconsinwas read, the remarks made in the Senate relative to the vote having been cast on the wrong day were repeated. A short discussion upon this point occurred, at the conclusion of which the President announced the state of the vote in detail, and, in further execution of the concurrent order of the two Houses, announced that James Buchanan and John C. Breckenridge were duly elected President and Vice-President for the term prescribed by the constitution, commencing on the 4th of March next. A resolution had been adopted to close the debate on the Tariff Bill on the 16th inst. Mr. Colfax, of Indiana, had presented the resolutions of the Legislature of Indiana, asking that sugar be admitted duty free.
The New York Berald, in reference to the Wisconsin vote question, says:-
" Congress has got into a dilemma. In accordanca with law, bothHouses met on Wednesday in convention to count the votes for President and Vice-President. The ceremonay is of itself of no practical importance usually, but in this instance a point of much interest has arisen. It is weil known that in consequence of a severe snowstorm, which blocked up the roads the WisconFin Presidential electors were unable to reach the capital of that State on the 3d of December and vote for President and Vice-President, as required by law. Their proceedings were unavoidably postponed till the 4th of the month; and the question is, ehall the vote of Wisconsin be ruled out "
The Secretary of State had recommended to Congress the appropriation of $8,000 for the suppressic,n of the slave trade on the principle asserted in the Act of 1819, and had favourably endorsed the application of the American Colonization Society for $30,000 for a similar object.
The New York Journal of Commerce comments on the miscarriage of the Atlantic Submarine Telegraph Bill in the House of Representatives as follows:-
"The International SubmarineTelegraph Bill was well received by the House when it was hint taken up, but has been losing ground since. A motion to refer it to the committee of the whole House, which would have been equivalent to its burial, was rejected, but another motion to refer it to the Post-office Committee prevailed by a majority of 12 votes. The Post-office committee may report it back if they ever have the chance for making another repost this sescion, but the prospect of its passsage this session is by no means very flattering. The company relied with confidence upon the merits of the measre for its success, and abstained from a resort to lobbying. This may be the cause of much of the outside hostility and inside indifference in regard to the Bill."
Some Californian capitalists had contracted with a New York shipbuilder for the construction of two steamships, each of 7,000 tons. They are to carry 3,000 passengers and accomplish the trip to the Isthmus in 15 days. The dimensions for these steamers are as follows :-Lengtb, 440 feet; breadth of beam, 55 feet; depth of hold, 34 feet.
The testimony in the Burdell murder case had ooncluded, and the coroner was to sum up on the 14th of March. Various articles of clothing had been analyzed, and blood was detected. The dagger with which the fatal stroke was presumed to have been given was free from bloody stains. Towards the conclusion of the examination an anonymous letter was sent to the coroner, communicating a rumour that a lkfr. Farrell was in Bond-street on the night of the murder, and had evidence to give of some importance, but that he declined to come forward "lest he should be kept from his family and inconvenienced by appearing as a witness, as he is a poor man." In cousequence of this communication Mr. Farrell was summoned to attend, and testified that ho was passing through Bond-street at about 11 o'clock on the night in question; that he sat down upon the steps of the house No. 31, and was there seated when a man with a shawl came up the steps and entered the house; that not more than a minute and a-half elapsed before he heard the cry of " Murder !" and then the fall of a heavy body; and that in half a minute after that a man in his shirt sleeves, with bushy hair, opened the door, looked out, asked him what he was doing there, shut the door, and went back. Mr.
earren got up, and, hearing nothing further, soon after went away. The witness was taken by the coroner into an upper room, in which the jury, reporters, policemen, and some 10 or 15 others had been introduced without his knowledgo, and asked if he eould identify any person there present as the man whom he had seen looldng out at the door on the night in question ? He looked slowly, carefully, and searchingly into the face of every man present-his eye ranging round the who'e circle-and seemed about to abandon the effort when his eye returned to the last man in the circl', rested for a minute steadily upon his unmoved countenance, and after some hesitation deelared that he was the man. This man was Eckel; and Mr. Farrell afterwards stated that he had no doubt whatever of his identity, though he had never seen him on any other occasion than when he opened the door on that fatal Friday might. A Mims Banford. also testified that a lady, whom she identified as Ms. Cunningham, came with a gentleman to her store on the Friday of {he murd--r to purchase alswordcane, saying it must be short
and stout, and must be had that day. It had been roved that Burdell was in Newv York on the day of
isaulleged marria e to Mrs. Ctuningham. Eckel and Cunningham were in custody. -When called ; upou. by the oroner liotls the prsowners delined to
Isay more than that they were innocent aud would reserve their defence.
Several Russian officials had arrived at New York, and were busily enaaaed among the shipbuilders and engineers of the port. Their mission extended to all matters of practical importance connected with navigation, the mechanics, arts, &c. They have minutely examined the new American steam-frigates, drawing therefrom comparisons with the vessels of other nations. It will be recollected that during the war the Russian Government contracted with Mr. W. H. Webb, of NTew York, for a line-of-battle ship, but that, owing to the risk, or rather the improbability of despatching her safely to Russia, the order was suspended. It has now been renewed. The ship will be a three decker of the largest class, with engines of great power. Agents vere engaged collecting the finest timber that could be purchased, the timber first collected having been used up in the Collins steamer Adriatic. The Russian officials had also contracted with two separate parties for raising the ships sunk at Sebastopol. In reference to the opinion of the Russians as to the relative qualities of English, American, and French marine engines, the New York Journal of Commerce maL-es a somewhat surprising statement, which would lead us to infer that the English are behind the French in the art of constructing marine machinery. It says:-
" Wo are led to infer that in the construction of the hulls of vessels they readily acknowledge our superiority over all others; but that in our steam engines, as applied to national sips, we are far hehind the French, and have some advances to make before we can even rival the English."
The Kansas correspondent of the St. Louis Demnocrat reports that a rencontre had taken place at Tecuniseh between Judge Elmore and the correspondent of the XationaZ Era, named Kagia. Both parties were wounded, but not dangerously.
The Missouri Senate bad passed a resolution declarng the emancipation of slaves in that State impracticable, impolitic, unwise, and unjust, and that it should be discountenanced by the people. The House had confirmed the resolution by a vote of 107 to 69.
A lieutenant of the United States' Navy has invented an instrument which when applied to the keel of a vessel gives the depth of water near shore or upon shoals, without the use of the lead, whereever the depth does not exceed two fathoms. A board of naval officers having reported favourably of it, the invention was about to be applied to a Government vessel.
An official return gives the militia force of the United States (exclusive of Iowa, Oregon, Washington, Nebraska, and New Mexico) at 2,716,094 men.
Mr. B. C. Bachman, ex-President of the Lancaster (Pennsylvania) Bank, had been arrested, charged with embezzling the fnnds of the concern.
The George Law had arrived at New York with advices from California of the 20th of January and $1,097,806. The Governor, in his address to the Legislature, expressed himself as opposed to repudiation.
The latest advices from Nicaragua announce that the steamner Sierra Nevada had left Acapulco on her return to San Francisco, having been unable to land her passengers at San Juan del Sur, that place being in the possession of the alied forces. The steamer Granada was to leave Aspinwall for Puenta Arenas for 300 of Walker's recruits. Having abandoned their crazy design of proceeding to his assistance in the rickety steamer which CaDtain Scott had given them, and petitioned the Costa Ricans for a passage back to the United States, the British Consul interceded in their behalf, and they were returned intheGranada. Therewas no news from Walker, he being hemmed in on all sides. It was known, however, that he suspected the trap in which he was placed, and that he proposed endeavouring to open communication with an 80 ton schooner which he had on the lake. The Panama Star thinks he is not in so bad a plight as was thought.
Advices from Mexico to the 29th report the defeat and dispersion of the Potosi insurgents. Another fillibustering invasion of Lower California, from San Francisco, was apprehended.
In the New York money-market the demand was active, and rates had advanced to 9 to 10 per cent. for prime paper according to maturity, and 7 to 8 per cent. on call. In exchange but little had been done, and prices in general were flat. The rates were 8E to 84per cent. premium on London; from 5f. 231c. to 5f. 224c. Paris; 5f. 21ic. to 5f. 20c. Antwerp; and 361 to 36i Hamburg. The stock market had continued to decline, and State loans remained greatly under par. Ohio Sixes had declined 1 per cent d-aring the week; North Carolina, 1; and Missouri Sixes, 1I. Indiana Five per Cents. had advanced 1 per cent.; Pennsylvanian, 24; Virginia Sixes, -1; and Californian Seven per Cents., 14. In anticipation of a general banking law Pennsylvanian bonds had advanced. The decline in railway stock had also continued, to the extent during the week of 21 on New York Central; 34 Erie; g Haarlem; 7 Reading; 24 Hudson River; 1J Michigan Central; 4 Southern; 14 Panama; 44 Cleveland and Toledo. Railroad bonds and miscellaneous securities were at extremely low prices. Erie Railroad Seven's, 1859, 98; Erie Bonds, '75, 93i; Illinois Central, Sevens, 991; New York Central, Sixes, 8&3-. The demana for cotton, part speculative, had been active, and, upon favourable advices from this side, had advanced c to i cent. The business for the three days was estimated at 17,000 bales, on a basis of 134c. for middling uplands. In flour comman brands were a trifle dearer and in good request, with light arrivals. The current quotations were above the limits of foreign orders, and the business was therefore restricted. Canada was unchanged and dul at $6 56c. to $7 62c. according to quality. Southern continued heavy and dull, with moderate receipts, wbich were likely, however, to be increased from the southern harbours having become accessible. Rye flour, in small supply, and with a fair demand, ruled very firm at $3 75c. to $5 25c. Cornmeal in moderate request and steady. Wheat remained quiet, buyers having the advantage. Rye scarce and firm, and no sales. Barley in fair request. Corn quiet and firm at 71 to 73 for sound Western mixed, and 72 to 78 for white Southern. Other kinds nominal. Oats firm, but unchanged in piice; Western, 52 to 54. Mess pork had declined 1Cc., with only a moderate inquiry. Other kinds unchanged. Old mess, $20 35c. ; prime, $17 50c. to $18; and $21 50c. to $22 for prime mess. Beef steady and firm, the stocks being moderate and receipts light. Old repacked WVesterns and new country mess $10 70c. to $13; country prime, $9 50c. to $10 50c.; acd $16 25c. to $16 50c. for extra Western mess. Prime mess inactive, and prices nominal. Beef hams scarce, and wanted, at a range of $20 to $22. Cutmeats at 83c. to 8ic. for shoulders, and 10*c. to 1oic. for hams. In bacon nothing doing. Lard ic. better, and a good demand at 13;c. to 13-sc. Butterand cheese active and firm. Sugar depressed, and a decline of kc. to lc. submitted to. Tobacco continued active and buoyant, and had advanced. Turpentine scarce, the stock bad, some to arrive being nearly aU engaged for London. Spirits of turpentine were coming in very slowly, and a short supply was anticipated. The market was firm at 524c. to 53c. for cash and sbort time. Common resin, with unusually light stocks, had advanced about five cents. White resin
in small supply, and full prices demanded. Tar in moderate request for consumption. Pig iron in better demand, and Scotch firm at $31 ex-ship, and $32 to $32 10c., six months, for small lots from yard. Bars quiet. English sheet, 34o. for singles to arrive; and 34c. to 3Qc., six months, for boiler plate ditto. Freights firm, but quiet; but expected to improve from the re-

DECIMAL COINAGE.
Mr. BE&MISH asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer the date of the R)yal Commission to inquire into the expsdiency of adopting a decimal coinage, the number of sittings the commissioners had had, what progress they had made, and when a report might be expected from them?
The CHIANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER replied that I the date of the commission was October, 1855. The com. missioners had held 18 sittings. To answer the question satisfactorily as to the progress made, it was desitable to explain shortly the course pursued by the commis. sion. The attention of the commissioners was directed in the first instaneo to a careful examination of the report of the committee of the House of Commons, and of the evidence on which that report was founded. It then proceeded to call before it as witnesses those persons who were understood, by their publications or otherwise, to be the most prominent and best informed of the opponent3 of the recommendations of the Parliamentary committee. At the same time the commission appulied itself to the preparation of a series of Questions to be sent to foreirn countries in which a decinial coinage had been introduced, with the view of eliciting information on several points, viz. --The previous state of the coinage, and the reasons which led to the introduction of a decimal coinage ; the dif. ficulties which had been found to attend the change ; the extent to which the decimal coinage had been brought inta practical use ; and the result, how far satisfactory or other. wise. The last of the replies to these queries had but recently been received, and they were now under the consideration of the commission. The commission hoped very shortly to make a preliminary report for the purpose of submitting to the Crown the information obtained respecting the state of the coinage in foreign countries, and the evidence of the witnesses already examined before the commission, together with some other documents. By this means the commission hoped that the attention of the public might be directed to many important considera. tlons and difficulties connected with this subject, without a careful examination of which no safe and satisfactory judgment could be formed. Some important branches of the question still remained for investigation; consequently it was not possible at present to speak with confidence as to the probable period at which a final report might be expected. The witnesses now about to be called were public officers connected with the army and navy, and who, from their experience, were competent to give an opinion respect. ing the application of the decimal coimaue to those branchc l
of the public service. The Master of the Mint would also be called to esplain the time, labour, and cost of providing any new coins which the dcsimal system would require. It was also proposed to examine witnesses from the several revenue departnuents and connected with the most important branches of manufacturing industry and commerce. Nor could these inquiries he completed without endeavourino as far as practicable to trace the effects which decimal coitsaze might produce on the ordinasy operations of the market, on the expenditure of the working classes, and on the payment of the wages of labour.
DISEASE AMONG CATTLE.
Mr. STAFFORD asked Nvhether the attention of the Government had been called to the epidemic disease amon cattle in Central Europe, and whether the Board of Contro'
had taken any measures to prevent the landing of diseased cattle in this counti ?
Mr. LOWE replied that the attention of the Board of Trade had been caUled to the subject, which had put itself in comnmunication with the Foreign-office, requesting that do. partment to obtain from consls abroad all the information possible on the subject. The Beard of Trade had likewise put itself in communication with the Customs, which de. partment possessed an Act of Parliament under which it
ad powers sufficient to prevent the importation of infected amimals. As an instance that the officers of that depart. ment were not wanting in diligence, he could inform the House that onl a calf on board the Concordia, from Rotterdam, exhibiting symptoms of murrain, they had the animal killed. Investigation then confirmed the Esspicion that the animal was infected, and the body was accordingly destroyed. The remnainder of the cargo was examined and found free from disease.
Mr. STAFFORD gave notice that to-morrow, on the motion that the House, at its rising, do adjourn till Monday, he should caU the serious attention of the House to this question of disease among foreign cattle.
THE CAFFRE FRONTIER.
Mr. &DDERLEY asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies when papers relating to the settlement of the German Legion on the Caffre frontier, and to the expendituro under two votes of 40,000C. each in the estimates of the last two sessions for pensioner settlements on that frontier would be laid on the table of the House?
Mr. J. BA-LL said the papers had been placed in the rinters' hands, and he expectcd to receive proofs immeClatalY. A detailed account of the expenditure under the votes for 40,0001. had not yet been received, but the Go. vernor of the Cape had been instructed to furnish it.
INDIA.
Mr. OTWAY asked the President of the Board of Con'rol whether a new loan to the amount of 3,000,0001. sterling. bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, had been recently opened in India; whether it was intended to devote the produce of that loan to public works in India; and, also, whether any guarantee of the interest of the loan for a certain period had been given?
Mr. V. S NUT asaid that the only information received on the sub5ect was by telegraph from Trieste, and, until the mails came in he c iuld not answer the questions in detail,
THE TEA DUTIES.
Mr. GIB30N said that comm unications had been made to him from his constituents complaining of the intenraptions caused to the tea trade pending the decision on the scheme of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and he there. fore asked whether it was not possible to take the tea duties first in the Committee of Ways and Means, so that the earliest possible decision might be taken on that subject, and the trade relieved from its present embarrassment?
The CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQU.ER believed that, in point of order, it was not competent for him to adopt that course. The first resolution on the income-tax had beeni readl in committeie and progress reported, and he aprehended that that miatter must be disposed of first of
Mr. GLAkDSTONrE desired to state the course he intended to take. He had given notice of a resolution on theSpeakr leaving the chair, to the effect that the House retain the present duties on tea and sugar. His object was to induce the House not to permit any inorease of the duties on tea and sugar bafore they went to the question of the remission of the war duties on incomes. But having considered the matter in reference to the s ales of the House he thought that would be an inconvenient mode of discussing the asbject. He should therefore make no preliminarg motion, but move, ir. Committee of Ways and Means, a resolution to the effect that the tea duty, from and after the 5th of April next, should be ls. 3d.in the pound, as providedbythe present law. If the Chancellor of theExchequerwasrightinsuppoesng that the resolution on the tea duties could not be taken first he (Mr. Gladstone) would take the sense of the Houseto morrow upon the proposition of which he bad given notice and the future course with regard to the budgetwould depenrd upon the disposition which might be manifested by the Government with regard to the tea duty.
FISCAL AFFAIRS (IRELAND).
Sir D. NORREYS moved for leave to bring in a Bill for the better administration of fiscal affairs in counties ia Ireland.
Mr. HUUIE presented a petition against the motion, and hoped that as the grand jury laws of Ireland (with which this Bill would interfere)had worked admirably to his personal knowledge for the last 20 years, the House would not graut to the hon. baronet the permission which he sought.
The question was put from the Chair, when Mr. Hus.%
said 4e should insist on a division being taken. He, however, chin?ed his mind, and leave was given to bring iu the Bil.
HOSTILTTIES AGAINST CHINA.
Mr. OOBDEX presented petitions from Brighton and Daaduton condemnatory of the hostile proceedings adopted by Sir J. Bowring against the Chinese at Canton.
, MIr. GIBSON presented a petition from MancLester to the sane effect.
Mfr. COBDEN then proceeded to submit the resolutions of which he lad given notice upon the subject, and itn joing go said,-KRnowing, Sir, to how large an extent the ^ational conscience has been moved upon the que6tion to
given to lorcias at Honglrong. That colony is inhabited by about 80,0O Chinese, many of them engaged in mercantile pursuits, but few of them British subjects in the full sese of the term. It was necearythattneirlawfultradeshould be protected, and the mode resorted to for doing this was by granting registers. not to encourage smuggling, but to prevent that and aU 'other abuses. The ordinance establishing this system was actually passed in consequence of the representations and complaints of the Chinese Government, to whom a copy of that document vas communicated by the local Government of Hongkong; and it Is only now that, in. connexion with the register of this particular lorcha, in which so many holes are picked! a doubt is stated as to the legality of the ordinance. It xi perfectly clear that the Chinese authorities knew they were doing wrong when they boarded the Arrow in the Canton river. We have the testimony of two respectable English witnesses, supported by Chinese evidence, that the British flag was flying at the time; and although I hear it s3aid that the colours were hauled down, there is not a tittle of re]iable proof of that assertion. Governor Yeh indeed says, " It is well known to your honourable nation that your flag is never hoisted at that particular part of the river where this lorcha lay." Now, the hon. member for the West Riding read a letter to us to-night which spoke directly to the contrary.
Mr. COBDBEN.-The letter referred to Whampoa. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-I believe that makes no difference. The Chinese authorities had no right to go with a high hand and haul down the flag; but, if they had any ground of complaint, they should have represented the abuse of the flag to our officials and requested that it might be prevented in future. If a similar case occurred between France and England, and there was a dispute as to whether a particular vessel was really French or En"lish, a complaint would be made to the authorities of the country whose flag had been used, instead of forcibly boarding her, hauling down her colours, and seizing her crew. This was no mere case of visiting a ship to give her a notice, as has been ingeniously represented-it was nothing more nor less than an outrage carried out in the most violent form. I caunot admit that the British officials behaved in an intemperate manner, and it is wholly gratuitous to ascribe to them any intentionto pickaquarrelwiththe Chinese. Consul Farkes did no more than his duty, and I cannot conceive how he could have acted, under the circumstances, in a more moderate spirit. I am not myself acquainted with Mr. Parkes, but in iustice to an officer on a distant station, who has a difficult duty to perform, and who has been so unjustifiably attacked in this House, I am bound to say that those who know him weRl have assured me that he is a man of good sense and good temper, and the last man in the world to behave in an intemperate manner on such an occasion. (Hear, hear.) When Commissioner Yeh refused the satisfaction which was asked Mr. Parlkes did not at once resort to violent measures. He allowed an interval of several days to elapse. He communicated with Sir John Bowring, who, when he arrived on the scene of action, repeated in his turn, courteously and temperately, but still in that clear and distinct manner which the representatives of the British Crown ought always to employ, the demand that reparation should be given for the insult offered to our flag. This, also, was refsed. The controversy went on. I will not pursue it step by step, because hon. members have no doubt, made themseves acquainted with the whole progress of events in the papers which have been laid before the House, but it was not until the Chinese had exhausted every Idnd of subterfuge, In which they are so well ski1led, to avoid giving satisfaction that something like hostile measures were resorted to. At first, hostilities were commenced at a distance from Canton; the Barrier Forts were taken; that failed to produce an effect, and stronger measures were taken by Admiral Seymour, who, I must say, appears to have conducted the operations throughout with the humanity and judgment to be expected from a man of his high reputation. It was not until the very last moment that Canton was attacked. I have heard it said that Canton was bombarded, but there has been no such thing as a bombardment of Canton in the ordinary sense of the question. I come now to a question which to a certain degree has been mixed up with this matter-the right of entering into Canton. Everyone is aware that this is a right which was conceded to us in the most express terms, and which, though its exercise has been postponed, has never been abandoned. The precise time for pressing that right was a matter of prudence and discretion, and I cannot say that I am satisfied that it was an improper moment, after hostilities had been commenced, to demand, not an indiscriminate entry for all the British residents, but that free official intercourse which, if it had been granted, it can scarcely be doubted, would have been most conducive to an amicable settlement of the differences. I have been told that Sir John Bowring has acted in direct violation of rpositive instructions given by Earl Grey, and never since revoked,-that in no case were aggressive hostilities to be commenced against the local Government of Canton without first referring home for instructions. I am prepared to express my opinion that Sir J. Bowring has not made himself liable to any such imputation. *Undoubtealy it was the intention of the Government at home, looking to the circumstances of the period, that the British authority should not be committedin aggressive collision with the Chinese, and by our local representative, at a time when there was not a force on the spot to support such an operation, but it is absurd to say that it -was intended to tie the hands of the commissioner under all contingencies, and not to give him power to act on the defensive, or to take steps to obtain redress for insult offered to our flag. If such had been the character of those instructions, never would an official have been placed in so deplorable a situation as our chief superintendant of trade with China. I have heard it said that it is a terrible thing that a Iritish official at Hongkong should have the power to involve England in war with China. I deny altogether that we are at war with China, and I hope we shall not be; we have a dispute vith the local Government of Canton, but I sincerely hope that it may not assume the proportions of a Chinese war. Bat when I am told that no governor can go to this stretch of authority I must beg leave to differ from that doctrine. I am no lawyer, and therefore shall not attempt to argue the question on technical grounds, but I think it is entirely disposed of by this passage from Lord Stowell, whose authority en these subjects I suppose no one will question. That great lawjer says,-
"A commander going out to a distant station may rea. sonably be supposed to carry with him such a portion of sovereign authority delegated to him as may be necessary to provide for the exigencies of the service in which he is employed. On stations in Europe where Government is almost at hand to superintend and direct the course of operations under which it maybe expedient that particular hostilities should be carried on, it may be different; but in distant parts of the world it cannot be disputed."
American authorities were largely quoted by the hon. member for the West Riding, but I must remind him that the Americans did not act npon this doctrine ; for when, in the counrse of these events, a Chinese battery fired on an American vessel, they, without waiting to write to Washington for instrctions, moved a war steamer down and demolished the battery at once. I agree most cordially that there is no leason why, because a nation with whom we happen to have dealings is semi-barbarous, that we should act towards it with violence, and with a disposition to make might the rule of right. On the contrary, we are bound by every consideration of religion and policy to be more than ordinarily forbearing with such nations. But, on the other hand, it is more necessary to make a display of force in derling with nations which understand no other argument than force than it would be in dealing with Christian andl civilized communitims Any man who is acquainted with China WilM tell you that everything like conces8ion or abandonment of your real rights is at once ascribed, not to your sense of justice, but to weakness and sim to eno. This circumstance shouldl nndoubtedly induce ad ional caution in entering into hostilities with such a people; but if you are convinced that the grounds upon which you proceed are just and reaonable, you cannot safely, or consistently with the interests of hunmanity, retreaf from that ground. I firmly beheve that in this quarrel we have substantially and really right on our side. I can have no doubt on reading the papers, that the British flag was hauled downepdL nutngy u outrageou y by Chinese officials in esewin gy, and can have no doubt that such reparation as 'was undlerstood to be sufficient by the Chinese thems,lves and by those Europeas most conversan1twith Chinese customs was not affordled. I believe, therefore, that the British officials had no option but to resort to those measures of force, which they unwillingly adopted. On the part of the Government at home I should feel great regret if their conduct was visited by the censure of thins House, but I should still muore regret to see the Governmnent exhibiting the weakness and pusillanimity of shriinking from the discharge of their duty In suportn British officials who have been placed in a
motpdrifcut and repnsible po'ion. (Hlear, hear.) If the Government OM protecting British commerce anld British honour, and said to their representatives who have discharged that duty, "We W°il censure, recall, and disgrace Tou," they would no longer deserve to be served by uPright, honest, or independent men.

(Cheers.)
Sir B. LYTTONl.-Although the right hon. gentleman has spoken with great earnestness, and although he has touched upon a great variety of subjects, I do not think he has succeeded in giving a very satisfactory reply to tho powerful arguments of the hon. member for the West Riding; aud if the House will vouchsafe me its indulgence, I think I may be able to show, without any tedious references to Parliamentary papers, how hopeless and groundless is the position assumed by the right hon. gentleman. Let me first briefly state the nature of the question before us, and then show, from the wording of the resolution, how little it merits the condemnation of the right hon. gentleman. The tVwO main questions before us are-first, was this vessel, the Arrow, bon214lcd a vessel belonging to the English nation, according to the plain meaning of the 17th article of the sup plementary treaty; and next, if that was the case, was the alleged outragson the part of the Chinese authorities jus. tifiable or not ? The 17th article of the supplementary treaty contains regulations respecting certain smaU vessels belong. ing to the English nation. The hon. member for the West Riding sks, however, " How cau a vessel that is noto. riously Chinese in every stage of its histoly,-that is built, owned, manned, and litigated for by Chinese, with nothing English about it except a mere lad of 20 years of age, who was hired by the Danish Consul as the nominal master,how can that be a vessel belonging to the English nation according to the plain meaning of the 17th rticle r? The right hon. Secretary for the Colonies (Mr. Labouchere) referred us to the practice of the Mediterranean. I will presently show the right hon. gentleman how differently that illustration applies. The only mode in which a Chinese vessel could become a vessel belonging t the English nation is by a colonial ordinance, and you mightas well by a colonial ordinance attempt to turn a tea tree into an oak tree. (Laughter.) Your colonial ordinances may bind your own subjects, but neither a colonial ordinance nor even an Act of Parliament can have the effect of international law upon other nations, whom such ordinance or Act of Parliament may concern. as the Treaty of Naukin has been referred to, and our own construotion has been put upon its aiticles, the Chinese have a right to refer to the date of that treaty. At the period when the treaty was concluded no class of vessels similar to the Arrow did belong, or covld by any possibility have belonged, to the Enngl;sh nation. The Chinese were not bound to alow you a right, by subsequent internal regulations, to appropriate to the English nation a certaiA class of ships which by build and ownership essentially belonged to the Chinese nation, for a fundamental maxim in the construction of all treaties which the noble lord at the head of the Government will not deny is that you must
be governed by the forms and usages -which were prevalen t | at the time the treaty was drawn up and concluded.
But, according to the words of the teaty adI the usage in force at its date, could the Arrow bh
regarded as a vessel belongiug to the English nation 9 By our Navigation Laws, as they existed at the time the treaty was made, not only must the vessel be a BI;tish vessel, but she must have a British stblect for an. ovaer and her crew must also be three-fourths British subjects. It was not until the year 1854, many years after that treaty
was made, that by the Merchant Shipping Act you could i have tortured this Chinese vessel into an English one. I now come to the supposed parallel which the sight hon gentleman has found in the ownerships of vessels in the Mediterranean. The difference between the two is this,there you. do not take a vessel belonging to another Sovereign. (Hear, hear.) I concede that by the Act of 1847 you may grant naturalization to certain Chinese aliens, but, ascording to the law of nations, only in the country of their adoption. I ask the noble lord-I ask any hon. memberto tell me whether, if a foreigner gets letters of naturalization or protection, they will avail him in the country of the independent Sovereign to whom the naturalized subject has belonged? (Hear, hear.) Youmaynaturalize an Austrian, but you cannot give him a passport that will protect him in Austria, unless Austria has first denaturalized him. (Hear, hear.) I will suppose that the naturalization of these Chinese aliens had given them rights which would avail them anywhere except in the seas and the empire of China;
but it could not give them protection there unless China, had denaturalized them or absolved them from their
allegiance. (Hear, hear.) This axiom belongs not to law, only but t civilization, and it is founded upon the princip e of reason, for, how can you take the vessel and the subjects of an independent Sovereign within his own jurisdiction and domain, and make your laws and customs supersede the laws and customs of the country to which these persons owe allegiance ? (Hear, hear.) How can you turn this vessel into a British vessel and these men uto British subjects without usurping the sovereign rights of the Emperor of China in his own dominions v The only law by which this could be said to be a British vessel is t
be found in the 17th article, which declares that every British vessel shall have a sailing letter or other act of registration which she is to deliver up to the British Consul on arrival, and which is to be restored when she sails. It is contended that because this vessel had a sailing letter she was unequivocally British. But the article only refers to vessdes tUat are bond fide British and that woul be considered British at the date of the treaty. It does not follow that every Chinese vessel which complles with the regulations of your last Shipping Act is therefore a British vessel, and entitled to be so considered under this treaty. She is not to be made English by doing 3omething which vessels legally English are required to do. If at the time of signing the 17th article of the supplementary treaty you had said to the Chinese, " We claim the right hereafter to sell the right of carrying the British fla to any Chinese vessel," do you suppose the Chinese would have acceded to such a demand, or that England would have gone to war for the monstrous privilege of seDing the flag of England for o0 dollars? (Hear, hear.) The English Government. after great reluctance, have conceded to the authorities of Hong-
kong the right to depart from the Act of Parliament and i from international law. You have given them the right ts make Chinese aliens the owners of Brtish vessels, with the design that legal tradin might be protected and illegal trading prevented. Wht has been the result ? In two instances our flag has been used inprotecting smuggling. In the present instance it was used to protect a pirate, and in the destraction of legal trading. I say that this vessel, belonging to Chinese subjects, manned by Chinese, and em-
ployed in Chinese waters, did not, at the date of the treaty, 1 belong to the English nation. If you chose to make it so by a local ordinanc that might bind your own subjects, butt would not acquire the forco of international law, and would not bind the Chiese, if they had never a-reed to it, which they never did. (Hear, hear.) This principle is clearly laid down by Wheaton, and other writers on international law; and it follows from this, as clearly as one problem of Eulid f.llows from another, that if after a treaty has been conclnded, you, as one of the contracting parties, alter your existing law so as to affect the Chinese, the other contracting parties, your alterations will be blnding on your own subjects, but that it will require the legislative power of China to give these laws force and effect in that country. (Cheers.) The whole argument lies in this. (Elear.) If you cannot by the 17th articlo of the treaty egll this a British vessel, then you cannot availyourselves of the 9eh article, and say that the Chinese could not interfere or board such an English vessel for a pirate, but that leave must first be .asked of the English ConsuL, That 9th article only agpliesto British merchantmen, and this was not a Buitis merchantman but a Chinese vesseL I will, however, grant for a moment the right of this vessel to be considered an Englsh vessel, and then I ask, was the mistake so inexcusable or the outrage so very gross as to warrant the terrible revenge that we have inflicted ? (Cheers.) What is the evidence on this subject? Four persons, two British and two Chinese, have deposed that the British flag was flying at the time the lorcha was boarded, and that it vas hauled down. What was the evidenoe brought before the Imperial Commissioner Yeh ? He had not four witnesses, but more than 70-the soldiers, the mandarin, and the crew -Nvho declared that the flag was not flying, and could not therefore have been hauled down. We are naturally incuM- oueee u own ountymen an Ye is intrllined
to believe his. Is not that natural, also ? and is it not the more excusable because, as the hon. gentleman the member for the West Riding has observed-and the statement has notbeencontradicebytherighthon.gentlemRn-the lorchas are boundtolower their flaswhen they come to an anchor? Now, the only witness-a Chinesewho goosmuch intodetail -states that he heard a mandarin say, " Why, this cannot be a foreir lorcha; there are no foreigners on board; haul dowin the lg." Grant that the mandarin was wrong; but still, when he comes in search of a pirate on board a vessel that had been notoriously a pirate ship (hear, hear), and wlien he doSesvotfnd0 a SMth fa,~ tden thee?

three-fifths of which were sold at Canton.. It was said that tl:e Chinese connived at the traffic. That there were corrupt officers in China he did not deny, bat the respectable inhabitants of China were strongly opposed to the iliit tiaffio, and to the connivance of the officers whose duty it was to suppress it. It had boen said that-the opium traffic bad nothing to do with the question before the House, bat he said it had everything to do with the question, since it zroduced feelings of deep hostility to Enghshmen and the E,nglish Government on the part of the Chinese. (Hear.) There were so many motives influencing the judgment of Chinese merchants that they were not safe guides to follow upon the present occasion. He denied that in respect to the Arrow we had any just claim for reparation, bta ad. mitted that with regard to the right of eptry into Cauton we had an undoubted treaty claim. Whether we ought to enforce that claim was a question which, he thought, must be decided in the negative. (Hear, hear.) Should the opinion of the House be pronounced against the proceedings of our officials at Canton, it would behove the Government to send some man of eminence from England to inqnire into the whole affair on the spot, and to report upon the mode in which our relations with the Chinese should be conducted in future. The notions afloat in some quarters with regard to annexations in China had been derided as abburd. It was because he believed they were not so visionary as some imagined that he had ventured to occupy the attention of the House so long, and to raise his voice on behalf of more moderate, liberal, and Christian doctrines. The most influential journals in India were week after week crying out for annexation in China and Persia, and the same principles of action were advocated hy the press in this country. He had no doubt that the noble lord at the head of the Government would repudiate all such schemes; but the war might cause the overthrow of the Chinese Government, already tottering to its base, and in that event the country would fall into our hands. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. GREGSON believed that the hon. and learned gentleman scandalized the English merchants at Canton when he stated that they were all engaged in the opium trade. None of those whom he (Mr. Gregson) represented had anything wbatever to do with that traffic. He held in his hand a letter from 29 gentlemen, now in London, who had resided for 5, 10, and 15 years in China, and who were as competent to form and express an opinion upon the question before the House as the hon. and learned member. They were wel known, both here and in China as men addicted to peace and to their own commercial pursnits. They were as averse to war as the hon. member for the West Riding himself could be, and their worst wish with regard to that gentleman was that, instead of contemrplating events in China at home, he might have the benefit of a few years' residence at Canton. (A laugh.) For his own part, he admired thehon member's sentimentsasafriend of peace, though he believed that if the peace party were now, or at any time, in power, we should bave no peace whatever. (Laughter.) However they might dislike national wars, they had evidently no objection to personal wars. If any person could have gone to China with pacific intentions, it must have been the hon. member's friend, Sir J. Bowing; and if Sir J. Bowrng had failed in preserving peace the hon. member might infer that even he himself would not have succeeded. The case of the Arrow had been so fully argued that he would not enter into it, but he ventured to say that that case was understood both by Chinese and Europens in the same sense. On all sides it was understood that the Arrow carried the British flag. (Hear, hear.) The name "Arrow" indicated that it was an English ship, for a Chinese ship would not have received such a name from the Chinese. The Commissioner Yeh was not justified in the proceedin he adopted, which constituted another insult to be added to many previous ones. This CommissionerYeh was a person of considerable influence ;he was one of the guardians of the heir apparent, High Chancellor of the Privy Council or Love-embodying Cabinet, President of the Board of War, and holder of other offices. The British residents on the spot had addressed a memorial to the Admiral expressing a bope that he would insist on his reasonable demands. As chairman of the East India and China Association he had received a letter signed by 29 gentlemen, who had been many years in Canton, and they staled that their correspondents in China approved the measures which the British authorities in Cfina had been reluctantly compelled to have recourse to; that the real matter of regret was that the due performance of treaty obligations had not long sinee been inqisted on; and that in their opinion coercive measures hpid been adopted only to the extent which the exigence of the case demanded. They added thatitwas their solemn conviction that if at the present juncture any sign of weakness or vacillation should he exhibited, or if the measures recently adopted were not vigorously prosecuted, under the authority of the Home Government, until every legitimate demand had been conceded and properly secured, ruptures between the two countries would be constantly recurring,
and life and property would be henceforth unsafe in Canton. The Chinese there, again emboldened by a retrogade policy, would then in all probability induce their countrymen to interrupt the trade at the other ports, and even Her Majestys colony of Hongkong might be placed in serious jeopardy, He was sorry to hear the hon. member for the West RMding s eak so disparaginglyof thecharacter of tbeBritiahmerchant.
Ne lidnotthinkthattheBritishmerchant wasthe selfish and avaricious being that the hon. gentlemanrepresented him to be, and he hoped, notwithstanding the hon. gentleman's declamation against the course adopted by the British authorities in China, the noble lord at the head of the Government would do everything in his power to enable the British merchant, in whatever part of the world he might be, to exclaim "Civia rnlanssictu sum" with the same feelings as a Roman citizen of old could say, " Ciis Romanus sum.." The hon. gentleman had said that the Aimerican and French Govern. ments would not join us in the course we had adopted towards China, but the representatives of both those Governments had already participated in it. The hon. gentleman had also said that the debates of the British Parliament were published to the world. Now, he (Br. Gregson) was sorry that they were so published, because it would be seen from the reports of those debates that men could be found in the House of Commons who, instead of defending, bitterly condemned our representatives for defending the interests of our fellow-countrymen in distant regions of the world. He lamented as much as the hon. member for the West Riding the calamities which had occurred in China, but be believed that they were inevitable. In conclusion he begged to impress upon the noble lord at the head of the Government the necessity of insisting upon the performance by China of the treaty which she had entered into with England, in order that, in the words of that treaty, perpetual peace and friendship might be for ever established
etween the two countries. ,
Lord J. RUSSELL-I have every disposition to pay respect to the wishes and opinions of the British merchants trading at Canton; but, while we allow due weight to their opinions and representations, we must not forget that it becomes us, the House of Commons, when such a motion as that of the hon. member for the West Riding is put before us, seriously to contemplate what has taken place, and to decide according to our views of the rights, interests and honour of our country (cheers), and not to allow our opinions to be entirely guided by any set of merchants, however respectable they may be. (Renewed cheers.) With this view I listened with great attention, and with no less anxiety, to the statement of my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies. I had hoped that the ambiguities which seem to rest upon the policy of Her Majesty's Government might be dispelled by his statement, that some now arguments might be adduced, and that, above all, some view of their policy might be unfolded to which Parliament might look for future security. (Hear, hear.) I am sorry to say that in all these particulars the speech of my right hon. friend was a disappointment. (Hear, hear.) The question is shortly divisible, as it appears to me, into three heads. The first is the case of the lorcha Arrow; the second, the entrance into Canton, demanded according to treaty; and the third, the policy which Her Majestys Government intend to pursue, and the objects at which they aim by the hostilities that have been carried on in China. With regard to the first of these I will not trouble tho House long, and I certainly need not enter into those questions of triple illegality to which my hon friend the member for the West Riding referred. That argument has been stated by him with great perspicuity and the general law of nations, so far as it affects this question, has been treated by my hon. and learned friend the member for Plymouth. A statement, however, has been made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies which apparently bears upon this question, but which really does not seem to me to touch it at all. The right hon. gentleman states that for a long time-he says for 200 years, but it matters not for how long-there has been the practice in certain of our colonies of granting licenses or passes to colonial vessels, within certain limits and for certain specified purposes. No doubt these passes have been granted. No doubt they are legal, so far as they are not in contra. venition of any Act of the Imperial Parliament. (Hear, hear.) But if they are in contravention of any such Act, I conceive that they are of no force or validity whatever. (Cheers.) With regard to this particular question of the license to the lorcha, it does meem as if Parliamenit had very lately declared that exceptions were to be mnde in the general law wtreadto British vesssls of British ownership. Bust.
as these were exceptions, certain rules were laid ^down by which this privilege was strctly guarded,; nd among those rules is laid down a provi6ion that every ordinance of a colony should be snctioned by Her Majesty in Oouncil. (Hfear, hear.) That, I imagine, cannot be evaded or set aside, and it has not, I believe, been observed with regard to the colony of Hongkong. (Cheers.) I conceive the question to be, not wFhether in Gibraltar or Malta passes might be granted which would be effectual for certain purposes, but whether those passes w hich are given to persons owo are, in fact, subjects of another country can override the laws of that country of which they are thesubjects. (Hear,hear.) Myright hon.friendseemsto think that with regard to the Chinese we need not be so very particular as we are with other nations; but I will take the case of Gibraltar. Many Spanish subjects reside there. Now, suppose that .one of these residents had one of those vessels to which passes had been given ; that among a num-
i ber of Spaaiards on board there was a man who had been
i lately concerned in piracy-say one of the Riff pirates; and that that vessel entered Ilalaa or Algeciras, I cannot believe tbat the Spanish authorities would hesitate to take that man out of the vessel and claim bimas a person subject to theirjurisdiction. (Irear.) In this respect the general law must obtain that, although your pass may be good in your own ports, it cannot prevail against the law of auother country of whicb the crew of the vessel are the sabjects. Will any man tell me that, supposing that the governor of Malaga or Algesiras had arrested this man, Supposing he had been clai'med by the British authorities, bat that claim had not been listened to and no apology had been made, the governor of Gibraltar would nave asked the commander of Her Majesty's ships to atack Agesirasor Malaga, toburntheSpanish vessels in thse ports, and to blw up the forts which protect them?
(Hear,hea) I thinkevery one must admit that no sach
course would have been pursuedl. It might have been that the Spanish authorities were we ong. ThED case would thea. have been referred home. The home authorities wouldI have applied to the Spanish Government for redress. Thea corresondence might bave lasted six months or perhaps a year, bitl h ave no doubt that redress would hiave been given for the wrong commnittedl. Let me say here with respect to this and to every other part of the queston, that the gist of the accusation which has been made by thLe ho. mnember for the West Ridling (Mr. Cobden) is not that our representatives at Canton have raise4l disput-ed questions, but that they proceeded by force of arms to effect the soluition of those que8tions when there was no such urgency in the case, andl when arms need not have been resorted to until an appeal had beern made to the authorities in this country. (Hear, hear.) Then, Sir, we come to the next question-one no doubt of great im.
prtarnce-that of our right to enter in:o city of Canton. The terms of the treaty are explicit enough on the subject. andthe gve s riht o nte te ctyof Canton as well
as heothr ourpotsto hih w hveaccess. But thlatI quesionhasbee potpoed romtime to time, and my obl frend at he ead of the Governicen, wen Screaryof SateforForeign Affairs, statd mst ale easos ad cocluivearguments agais pressing that question. Hesi "Above all, iisone of those advantages which, if you canx obtain it by fair negotistion, may be of considerable use; but the whole advantage will be destroyed if you attempt to obtainx it byforce of arms. (Hear,hear.) Every concession wlaih you might obtain will becomee useless anxd barren, and even injurious in your hands, if thus obtained." Unfortunately, Sir J. Bowring has not taken that view o' the nestion an mnore than that, he has added this question, awTiich o0futssenIf had been very difficult, and which since 1842 san 1856 had never been solved, to a quarrel already existing, and had thus embittered and aggravated the disunion between the Chinese governor and ourselves. (Hear, hear.) I can imagine that the British Government maight decide, in conformity with the views of the hon.' gentleroan who spoke last-they might say, '"Our treaty rights have not been fulfilled; we have suffered
ijries e Musit take these injuries to the Chinese Gouvernment, and, unless within a certain period they are redressed and our treAty rights are fully granted, we give notice that it will be a casus bedli, and that the refusal shall he equivalent to a declaration of war." That meight be pe s'ible. I do not say that it would be, but it wouldbeowithin the province of the suipreme authority of Great Britain. But in that case how Would you proceed? Yout would, in the first plc, necessarily proceed with the authority of the British Goavernment at home. (Hear, hear.) go great a question, which has been so long in abeyance, ought not to be settled without the full, solemn, and deliberate determination of the British Government. In the next p lace, you would give the Emnperor of China a certain time within Which to decide upon his course. I will not say that, if you sad the decision must be made within a month or six weeks, or three months, the Chinese Govemnment would come to a determination to perxit you to enter the city of Canton. It may be that they would so resolve. It may be that the question is not worth pressing ; but this, at all events, would be in conformity with; the usage of civilized nations, and would not be in contradiction to your own rights by treaty, But what has been done by Sir John Bowring, and Sir Michael Seymour acting in conformity with the wishes ef Sir John Borng Thi occurrence with regard to theArrow took place, Ithn, about the 8th of October. On the 21st and 22d of that month Comimissioner Yeh wrote letters which appear to meto be an apology for that occurrence. These letters are said by Sir J. Bowrsng to be evasive. They do not appear so to me. (Hear, hear.) He says most distinctly, ', We consideredl this to be a Chinese vess4el, and the in. formation I have had is that the flag was not hauled down." To be sure, there is coufficting testimony upon that subject; but it is remarkable that the statement of one of the seamen who was on board the Arrow shows that the intention was not to insult the British Government, because he says that the mandarin who came on board, after looking round, said, " There is no British captain here, there is no Englishman here. This cannot be a British vessel, it must be a Chinese one, therefore haul down that flag." (Hear, hear.) If that is a true statement, It certainlyv contradicts the Chinese Commissioner, and is in favour of the English testimony as to the flag being hauled down ; but is
itnot proof that if the mandarin had seen an English captain on beard, he -would not have lowered the flag, and would have asked hMm to redres the grievance of which ha complained, that a pirate was harboured on beard the ship?I I conclude froma this that it was not an intentional insult. Buttmore than this. The commissioner saT's8:-"In future, if there are foreign lorchas in the port, I wMl takce care that no men are taken out of them without communication with the consul." Besides this he had restored the l.2nmen. Now, consideringthese thre things, that the flag, if taken down, was taken down because no Englishman was on beard, th%t it was promised by the commissioner that never again should a foreign lorcha be deprived of its meni or have its flag hauled down, and thast the men were restored -I think, in the case of what was after all but a very paltry affair (hear, hear), this satisfaction mnight have been taken, and Sir John Bowring might have said ' "I consider this affair is over, but I shall report it to my C6overnmnent and see whether they think it necessary to take any further steps in the mnatter." Ilnstead of pursuing that course, Sir Michael Seymour, on the 27th, in conjunction with Sir John Bowring, makes positive demands that this entranee into the city shall be granted, and instead of giving three mnonths, or a month, or a week, proceeds that very same day to destroy the forts (hear, hear)3 and to commence hostile opertions. (Hear, hear.) Is that the way to obtain redres from any Government ? is that the way in which a great question which had been in abeyance for so l!ong should have been revived? It is at this point that I think the responsibility of Her Majesty's Government really begins. In thefis instance, they received from Sir JohnBowriag and from the admiral an account of the hauling downworf the fla", and a statement that they had in consequence seized an fusperial junk. The Secretary of State replied that the law offiers of the Crown had been consulted;- that they were of opinioa that the Arrow was legally entitled to tfie privileges of a British vessel, and that therefore he approved of (he conduct of the authorities at Canton in having seized the junk. So far there was at least no great harm done, although I think there might have been added some caution not to pursue hostilities. But when they received-which must have been towards the enda of December-the account that hostilities had been continued, that Sir John Bowring and Sir Micheael. Seymour had on their own authority undertaken to raise this great question upon which the whole of our amicable intercourse with Canton depended-viz., that of our entrancemito the city-and that, without giving sufficient time for a refereuce to Peldn or for a determination of' the British Government, the admiral had at once proceeded to attack the forts, and afterwards, I think, to destroy the fleet,-it does seem to me that Her Majesty's Government should have considered that these officials had committedl a serious offence against the interests of this country(hes htte a
pihu cueut in jeopardy our amnicable relations witha great and popuous em pire, and had presumed to take upon themnselves th e solution of a question which three different Secretaries of State had declared, in the clearest and mnost explicit language, shiould not be decided without a refer. nene home and without due deliberation by Her Majesty's Government. (IRenewed cheers.) What, however, was the language addressed by Lord Clarendoin to Sir John Bowring and Sir Michael Seymour? On the 10th of J-anuary he informed Sir J. Bowring th%t " Her Majesty's Government entirely approve the course -which has been adopted by Sir M. Seymour and yourself." (Hear, hear.) Sir, I do think that this is a very serious matter ; I do think that the giving their approbation in these few words, without explicit instructions, without saying what was to be done, without any notice of the assumption of authority, was neglecting the duty, the solemn duty, which was imposed on Her Matjesty's Government. (Opposition cheers.) I now come to another part of the question 'which seems ti) me, serious as are the other points, to demand the especial consideration of Parliament, and of which hitherto we have had no informiation fromn Her Ma. jesty's Government. My ri&ht hon. friend the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies says,"1 We arenot at war with China." Wel,if we are not at war with China it Is not the fault of Sir J Bowring, or of Admiral Seymour, or of Her Majesty's Government. It is the result of the forbearance of the Chinese Government in not immediately directing that at all other parts of their empire we should be rearded as carrying on hostilities with them. For I take it that, barbarians as the people are- and I certaiuy am not much of a'a admirer of Chinese civilizAtion-no Power in Europa, and undoubtedly not the United States of America, would allow its forta to be battered and one of its seaports, containing mnore than 1.000,000 of inhabitants, to be fired in imore than one or two places, and not resent such acts, as an attack upon its integrity and indlependence. (Hear, hear.) The ChineseGovernmient, however, has not donseso, and happily we are nxot at war with it. But, then, what is it that is to be our policy ? I find that Sir J. Bowring and Con. sul Pa-rkesgo very far on this subject. On the 8th of October and the foliowing days Mr. Parkes asked that the men of the lorcha should he returned, that some kind of apology should be miade for hauling down the British flag, and that an indemnity of some kind should be paid to the owner of the Arrow for the time she was detained. That, at all events, was not a very serious demand. As I have already said, I think that its spirit was complied with. But in the view of our authorities at Canton, it not being complied 'with, they proceeded on the 27th of the same month to add to that dematnd a furthier one, which could hardly be ohtained except by hostilities, and hostilities, too. ont the Most~ ax nJ-nms, netrneino-- iyo
Canton. But this is not all. Is thisrpaonlriey adopted by our authorities at Canton also adopted by Her Majesty's Government ? I Am Afraid nnt ; because I see that on the 25th of November Sir J. Bawring, writing to Mi. de Courcy, wlo had told him, with a degree of prudence and discretion that I could wish some of our English offio3rs would imitate (hear, hear), that he had withdrawn the men whom he had sent in conjunction with the English, and that he would not undertake any operations without immedliate authority from the Emperor of the French-S5ir J. BowrinG, in reply, says:-
"I thank you at the dams time very cordially for the eidence you have given of agreement and moral adhesion with u in the tra.ve events that ha e taken place at Canton, nwhich csinot ut bave an important bearing upon thatgreaqum shtin which so deeply concerned us all-the revision o our treatree with Chinia."
Now, what does that mean ? You may ask, as I think you are entitled to ask, if you think it wise and politie so to do. thatChina should com lately execute the treaty made by Sir H. Pottinger in 1842. Yon may say -you will take nothing less than its full and strict fulfilment; hut that is quite another question. You have no right to insist on now terms, such as that you shall be admitted to all other parts of China, or that Tou shall have an embassy at Pekin, and' various other things that have been spoken of, withnut gomg to war, or without having a justifiable cause of wai. (Cheers.) I defy you to aay that heh haulng down of the flag of th;s miserable lorcha, and the refusal to admit you to Canton nfter you had made it an understanding almost dince 1849that you oul not insist upoa entering tho nblaceI defy the British Government to say that 'they have a .justifiable c-use of war -with China, or any right to claim the revision of our treaties with that empire, upon two such contemptible pleas. (Hear, hear.) Youstate that
which I am about to invite the attention of the House, judging from the manifestations of opinion that have been given by those organs by which we learn what is passing in the minds of the people of tb.s great nation, and balievin; from all the indications which we can have that there is a large amountofsympathyfeltfor tehosabjectof myresolation
I can only regret that the task which I have to perform hasI not faUen into other hands. Bat let me say at the outse' that, whatever may be derision of the House on the merits of the case, it canuot in any degree: suffer from its advocate. I beg distinctly to state that I have no personal or party
object in view, and that I have no motive whatever but to I arrive at a just decision on the important question which I am about to submit. Personally, I have every motive for avoiding to give pain to, and still more to visit with retribution, the gentleman who now fi3s the situation of Plenipotentiary at Hongkong, who, except his conduct is endorsed and adopted by the Government, I hold to ba entirely responsible for the proceedings which I am about to bring under notice. Sir John Bowring has been an acquaintance of mine for the last 201years. I have no vindictive feeling against him, and I have no desire for vengeance upon any party. I wish the Government had never adopted a hasty decision upon this subject (hear, hear), as we might then, withount embarrassment, have come to a just decision upon the case immediately before us. Now, to begin at the beginning, it appears that on the 8th of October last=a vessel called a lorcha, which is a name derived from the Portuguese settlement at Macao, on the mouth of the Canton river, opposite to that where Rongkong lies, and which merely means that it is built after the European model, not that it is built in Europe-was bearded in the Canton river by Chinese officers. Twelve men were taken from it on a charge which appears to be saubstantiated by the depositions of witnesses, that some of them had been concerned in an act of piracy. Twelve men were removed from, and two were left in charge of, the ship. Immediately upon the matter coming to the knowledge of our consul he made a reclamation to the governor, claiming the return of these men, on the ground that, by the treaty with China, any malfeasants found on board of a British vessel and claimed by the Chinese authorities, should be demanded from the consul, and not taken by a visit of Chinese officers to the ship. The answer given to the demand of Mr. Parkes-andthe whole of the,testimony turned upon this point-was that the ship was not a British bat a Chinese ship. The matter was referred to Sir John Bowring at Hongkong, which is 12 hours' sail from Canton. On the 10th, that is two days after, nine of these men were returned to Mr. Paskes. Three others, against whom grave suspicion existed, w, ere retained, in order that their case might be further inquired into. And thus the matter remained, when Sir J. Bowring determined that unless witbin 48 hours the whole of the men were returned in a formal and specifc manner, and an apology given for the act of the Chinese officers, and a pledge given that no such act should be committed in fature, naval operations should be commenced against the Chinese. On the 22d of October the whole of the men were returned. (Hear, hear.) A letter was sent in which Yeh, the Chinese Governor of the province, stated that the ship was not a British ship, that the English had really no concern in it, but th%t he returned the men at the instance of the consul, That letter was accompanied by a promise that in future great oare should be taken that British ships should never be visitd improperly by Chinese officers. On the 23d-that is to say, the day after-operations were commenced against the Barrier Ports on the Canton River. From the 23d of October to the 13th of November these naval and military operations were continuous. The Barrier Forts, the Bogae Forts, the Blenheim Forts, and the Datch Poly Forts, and 23 Chinese junks, were all taken or destroyed. The suburbs of Canton werr, puUed, burnt, or battered down, that the ships might fire upon the walls of the town; aud bear in mind that these suburbs contained a population which were entirely dependent upon trade, and were oar only friends in the neighbourhood of that city. These operations continued until the 13th of November, the governors house in the city was shelled, and sheUs were thrown at a range of 2,000 yards that they might reach the quarter in which the various Government officers resided at the other side of the towa. This was the state of things at the date of our last advices, as we are informed by pathetir appeals made by the inhabitants, by repeated communications from the governor, and by the statements of deputations, including some men of world-wide reputation, such as the Howquas and others engaged in trade. 1 lay this basis for our investigation, not with the view of appealing to your humanity, not with the view of exciting your feelings, but that we may know that we are now at war with China, and that great devastation and destruction of property have occurred. What I ask is, that we shall inquire who w sre the authors of this war and why it was commenced, and that I ask not in the interest of the Chinese, but for the defence of our own honour. (Hear, hear.) I ask you to consider this case precisely as If you were dealing with a strong Power instead of a weak one. (Hear, hear.) I confess I have seen with humfiliation the tendency in this country to pursue two courses of policy, -one towards the strong, and the other towards the weak(Cheers.) Now, Sir, if I know anything of my countrymen, or anything of this House of Commons, that is not the natural quality of Englishmen. It never was our ancient reputation. We have had the character of being sometimes a little arrogant, a little overbearing, and of having a tendency to pick a quarrel; but we never yet acquired the character of being bullies to the weak and cowards to the strong. (Hear, hear.) Let us consider this case precisely as if we were dealing with America instead of China. We have a treaty with China, which in our international relations with that country pats us on a footing of perfeci equality. It is not one of the oldconventions such as existed between Turkey and the other European States, in which certain concessions were made without biuding clauses on both sides. Our treaty with China binds us to a reciprocal policy just as our treaty with America does ; and what I say is, let us iu our dealings with that country observe towards them that justice which we observe towards the United States,or France, or Russia. (Hear.) What are the grounds of this devastation and warfare which are now being carried on in the Canton river? Our plenipotentiary in China alleges that a violation of our treaty rights has taken place in regard to this vessel, the Aizow. In the first place, I think that *s a question which might have been referred home before resorting to extreme measures. (Hear, hear.) As to the question of international law, I should, after the statement wbich I heard made by Lord Lyndhurst in another place on Tuesday evening, think myself very presumptuous if I were to detain you by any statement of my opinions. Lord Lyndburst declared that, with reference to this case of the Arrow, the Chinese governor is right; and I heard him say that, in giving his opinion, he could not do better than use the very words used by the Chinese governor-that this vessel, the Atrow. is not in any respect a British vessel. But we have other grounds of testing the
I;WLtui use UUS maTaer. when Mr. P?arkes communicated the fact of this visit to the lorcha to Sir J. Bowring, he received an answer; and what was that aswer ? Sir J. Bow. ring,being then vithin12 hours' steam fromCanton, receives the letter written by Mr. Parkes on the 10th, and on the 11th he writes a letter, in which he says:-
"It appears, on examination, thattheArrow had noright to hoist the Br-tish flag (hear, hear); the lieense to do so expired on the 27th of September, from which period she has not been entitled to protection. You will send baok the register to be delivered to the Colonialoffice."
And on the following day, when not called upon to refer to the subject, he says:-
"I will consider the regranting the register of the Arrow, if applied for; but there can be no doubt that after the expiry of the license protection could not be legaUy granted."
(Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, I mightstop here. Here is the whole case; but what course did Sir John Bowring recom. mend Mr. Parkes to take under these circumstances? I ask you to consider the matter as though you were dealing with another Power. If you please, we will suppose that instead of being at Hongkong dealing with Canton, we are at Wash. ington dealing with Charleston. Not long ago a law was passed in South Carolina, which went* very much against the most cherished predilections of this country, by requiring that when a coloured citizen of this country-as much an Engl3shman as you or I-arrived at Cbarleston, he should be taken out of the English ship, put into gaol, and kept in custody there until the ship was ready to saiL Now, if there could be one measure more calculated than another to wound our susceptibilties as a nation it was that. (Hear, hear.) What did our consul at Charleston do ? Did he send for Her Majesty's ships of war and bombard the governor's residence? No, he sent to Washington and informed our Minister of the matter. The Minister went to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and received an explanation which amounted to nothing else than this,-" We are in a difficulty, and you must have patience with us ;" and we had patience; we did not resort to force. Now, had this case occurred in America, what would have been the course of our ambassador at Washington when he received the lettor from our consul at Charleston saying that he had demanded reparation from the American authorities there? When he referred to the documents which he had in his arehives, and found that owing to the lapse of time the instrument upon which the consul had procoeeded had become void, and therefore he had no legal standing ground as against the American Government-whioh was prcoisely the case, as admitted in this insance, the license having expired 14 days before-he would have written Lnck to the consul aaying, "You have been too precipitte, The captaia of this ship, by neglecting to renew bls license, has plaoed himself in an illegal position. You have been precipitato in de-
manding redress from the governor of South Carolina;-
MIake your apology az soon as you can, and get out of th:l business." What was the conduct of Sir John Bowring ! Alter telling Mr. Parkes that the license had expired and that the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag, hs added, " but the Chinese have no knowledge of the expirs. tion." (Cheers.) When I read that letter in the country i5 was in The Times newspaper; I would not believe its validity, but sent to London for a Copy of the GeazU iaa order that I might read the document in the original
Always wishing to save the charaeter of an absent man. and believing that that must have been penned in a moment of hallucination, I say that it is the most fagitious publie document that I ever saw (cheers), because it exhibits the avowal of a falsehood, and of the disposition to profit by it5 (Hear, hear.) I frequently complain of the number of public documents which are laid before us in a mutilated condition; I always regard with suspicion any letters whic i are headed " Extract ;" but what Was the right hon. gentle
fnan about who had the revising of these doeuments ? Why. did not he leave out that part of the letter ? For the credit of the cousntry and his own credit I wish he had. (Crie3 o "No, no!") At aU events, let it be well understood that if we follow out the policy adopted by Sir T. Bowring upon no better foundation than this, we take upon ourselves th,3 responsibility of his deeds and share the guilt of that state. ment. (Hear, hear.) Connected with thistransaction there are questions as to whether, when the ArTow was boarded she had her colours flying and an English master on board. After what we have heard I think all these question3 secondary, but I am by no means satisfied that w, stand any better in regard to them than in regard to that to which I have just referred. I, the first letter written on this subject by Consul Parke he says he has proof in his possession, showing beyond th: possibility of doubt that when the vessel was boarded ther; was a British captain on board, who remonstrated agains' the acts of the Chinese, and that tho British flag was also flYing at the time. Now, the fact turns out afterwards that the captain in his own declation states that he was .not on board the vessel (hear, hear); that he was taking his breakfast with another captain in another vessel. That, however, I regard as altogether of secondary importance. 'But there is another ilegality in this matter. Here are two illegalities which you have to contend with :-First, the clear doctrine of constitutional law laid down by Lord Lyndhurst that you cannot give rights to a Chinese shipowner as against his own Government. An unlearned mun like myself and the Chinese GovernorYeh seern instinctively to have come to the same conclusion. 1 can't for th, life of me see how it is possible that we can invest ourselves with the power, at Hongkong, of annexing the whole Chinese mercantile marine,-of protecting it against its own Government and absolving Chinese subects from their natural allegiance. But, beFides the llegality admitted by Sir J. Bowring, there is another. Even admittinp that the lorcha's register was aU in order and that the ficense had been paid up, still it is declared authoritatively, and is beyond a doubt, that the Hongkong Govefnment had no power to violate the statute law of this country by gi,ving any such license. The Hongkong Legislature cannot act in contravention of the fund *- mental principle of our Navigation Law; and therefore the whole register and license were mere waste paper, even if they were in order. Thus you have a threefold iUegality to struggle against. The noble lord (Palmerston) I s!e is talng a note. I wish him to answer one thin" that was said by his colleague in another plaae'. Lord Clarendon, alluding to this point, used a very fallacious argument. Hle said, a EIongkong register could not give imperial rights to a ship, but could give only Ecitish protection to a ship in China. That is the very place where wve say it cannot. It can give protection any. where else but there. Howv can the legislation of the Hongkong Government have any force in China without the imperial sanction? 2It is only through the instrumentality of an Act of Parliament here that the Hongkong Legislature exists at all, and none of its acts are binding in China, er anywhere in fact, without the confirmation of this country. I don't wish to convert this into a legal debate, and it would be presumption in me to say another word on this part of the question. The Duke of Argyil, indeed, finding himself entirely beaten on the law of the cse, says, "Don't argue thi- subject on low, legal, and technical grounds. (A laugli.) You musttryit on broad generalgrounds." I leave itto other members Of this House to vindicate the legal profession, which lies at the foundation of al civilization, from the unworthy aspersions thus inferentialy cast upon it. Assumning, then, that thewhole thing was illegal onourpartand this caunot be denied, for no lawyer with a reputation at st-ke, and who is not on the Treaury bench (a laugh), wiU venture to assert a doctrine contraty to that of Lord ,yndhurst-I pass to another branch of the question, with which I can more appropriately deaL Although the Chinese did not -iolate the law, still they might have had the intentlon to insult us. It is aegea that in boarding the Arrow the Chinese authorities did it premeditately in order to insult us. Having the law on their side, they yet might have enforeed it with that view. I say that is quite a distlnct issue ; but let us see what grounds there Pre for this assertion. Without travelling out of the qu.estion, I may remind you of the exceptional character of the trade carned on by European vessels on the coast of China. We aU know that a great deal of irregular trade goes on at that coast. Is it an extraordinary thing that the whinese authorities should board a vessel of Eeropean build and carrying the British flag ? In the correspondence r- latin totheregistration of colonial vessels at Hongkoti, Sir J, Bowring gives a case in which two vessels entitled to bear our flag were seized because they had cargoes of salt. Being seized under the treaty their contents were liable to confiscation, but the Chinese Government had no right to retain the vessels themselves. The Chinese having taken the vessels to empty them, and dismantled them and kept them too long, our agents made a demand for their return and sent a ship of war's cutter to bring them away. This might have been aU very regular, but it only leads to the inference that the Chinese have occasion to visit our vessels without necessarily going to insult us. I hold in my hand a communication from an American gentleman, who left Canton on the 16th of last November, and was one of those who entered within the walls of that town in the rear of our forces. His name, which I am at liberty to mention, is Cook-he lives at Whampoa, where he has been for four years, holding the position of Unlted States' Marshal, and therefore having jurisdiction over the flag of his own country. In course of conversation Mr. Cook, in answer to my inquiries, stated many cases in which British shiuswith the British flag, were engaged in smuggling trausactions,and he mentioned one in particular of so ve-s glaring a natare that I asked him to put it on paper. I give this as an example of what has been going on in the neighbourhood 'f Canton, to afford a vald plea for what the Chinese authorities have done in this case of the lorcha. Mr. Cook, in h's letter, written to-day, says: -
"In answer to your query whether I have any objections to the use of my name regarding our conversation on China matters, I say most certainly not, and I wiU give you the facts in regard to the seizUre of the lorcha as near as po;sible, from memory, having no data to refer to. Daring the summer of 1855, in June or July, there lay near our chop, which is close to Her Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consulate, at Whampoa, from 10 to 15 lorchas, enga^ed in smuggling salt, and 8 or 10 of this number hoisted Bitish flags durng the day, the salt being diqcharged at nigh . The number of vessels was thus large at that time in consequence of the mandarin boats having been sent above Canton to repulse the rebels, but the Government could n t keep ignorant of so bold a matter long, and 12 or 15 mandarin boats, each containing upwards of 60 men, made their appearance early in the morning, and captured the who'e fleet, five or six of which had British flags flying at the time, the Europeans (generaUy a captain) As well as the Chminese jumping overboard and swimming to the different vessels for safety, several of whom came on board of our vessel. The mandarin force took the captured fleet to Canton, and tle parties having the right to fly the flag stisequently claim their vessels, which were eventaally rsturned, and the remainder retained by the Governmnen. This is by no means an isolated case as regards the ieg .1 nc of the flagy, and you have only to refer to the Hongkong papers to find plenty of cases wherc thcright was quesiooned to ant the flag as it had becn done by the lIongko:g autnorities.7 ier~tOHnk~
In justice to the writer I must say-and without the pr.- viso he would, lIam sure, feel that I had b2en guilty of a breach of faith-that he is as completely an anti-Chinese as anybody I ever met. He wishes every success to everyonie who will go and attack the Chinese, to make them mote American and more European in their notions (a laugh) ; and he would not be supposed to say a word to excexse them from any horrors that you may inflict upon thnei

This, then, is a reason why we ought to be tolerant towards the Chinese, and not assume, as a matter of course, that they intended to insult us because they boarded this lorcha, even though the British flag nssht belflying at the time. (Hear, hear.) I must beg the House to remember who the correspondents were. On the one side you have Consul Parkes, a gentleman of considerable *bility, no donbt, and a good linguist (I believe some of Us saw him not long ago when he came over with the Siamese treaty), hut still a young man, without experience and without having gone through the gradations of civil employment calculated to give him that moderation, prudence, and discretion which he may one day possess; and, on the other side, the governor of a province which, according to Mr. Montgomery Martin's book, contains 20,000,033 inhabitants, a Cabinet Mlinister, and one who has no doubt gone through all the grades of ciyil employment. Now, I ask any man who has read this correspondence, does it bear upon the face of it the slightest intiniation that the Chinese Governor wished to insult the British authority? (Hear, hear.) Must it not be admitted-as was said by Lord Derby in that briliant and admirable speech of his-that " on the one siae there were courtesy, orbearance, and temper, while on the other there were arrogance and presumption ? (Cheers.) The correspondence loses half its effect we o not bear in mind the dates and the circumstances under which it was written. While it was being canied on every day witnessed the demolition of some fort or the burning of some buildings; and yet, here on the 12th of November a fortnight after his own house had been shelled and entered by a hostile force-(I have no doubt that the officers and men who performed their duty conducted themselves with all moderation, but I am informed that they were followed by a rabble who destroyed a great deal of valuable property)-Comnslssioner Yeh writes to Sir John Bovwring m this mild and conciliatory tone:-°
"Again, the 12 men seized were all taken back by Hew, s istant magistrate of Nanhae, on the 22d nlt.; but Con. sul Parkes declined to receive either them or a despatch sent with them from me. The letter under acknow. ledgment savs that, had the authorities been accessib!e to the consul, the affair might have been disposed of in a single interview. The assistant magistrate, Hew, was sent twice with the men to be surrendered; it is through him that (foreign) correspondence with me is always trans mitted. Now, the assistant magistrate isa commissioned offieer of the Chinese empire. Heretofore any foreiga business that has had to be transaeted by deputy has been transacted by officers similarly deputed, and the present was a case of all others requirnLg common conference; but Consul Parkes had made up his mind not to consent to what was proposed. On a subsequent occasion I sent Tseang, Prefect of Lay-chow-foo, to the foreiga factories to consider what steps should be taken, but the consul now insisted on something more than (the rendition of) the men captured on board the lorcha. There being in all this no inaccessibility on the part of Chinese officials, what was there to make an immediate adjustment impracticable? Yet on the 23d, 24th, and 25th ult. the different forts of the city were occupied or destroyed, and from the 27th ult. to the 5th inst. a canmonade was kept up by which numberless dwelling-houses in the new and old city were consumed with considerable loss of life. I still forbore, remembering how many years you had been at peace with us ; but the people were now gnashing their teeth with rage at the terrible suffering to which they had been subjected. Imagine it, that the simple fact being that a seizure was made by the Chinese Government of Chinese offenders whom it wasa duty to seize, it is pretended that the British ensign was hauled down; and this Is followed up by a movement of troops and a cannonade, to the infliction of terrible suffering on the people. I must beg your Excellency to pass an opinion on sueh a state of things."
Does not this letter prove that the man who wrote it under such harrowing circumstances had, above all things, a desire to conciliate andsmooth down the differences which existed ? (Hear, hear.) Nothing is more striking in this correspond. ence than the manner in which Commissioner Yeh constantly harps upon the same string-that the Arrow was not a British vesseL (Rear, hear.) I have counted in the papers no less than eight letters in which that declaration is reiterated in different forms to Consul Parkes, to Sir J. Bowring, to Admiral Seymour, and, I believe, even to the Ameilcan representative. There are instances in which his language is as terse, logical, and argumentative as if it bad been Lord Lyndhurst himself who spoke. Here is an example, and I read this extract because it is tho very dictumn laid down by Lord Lyndhnrst the other night. Writinr to Sir J. Bowrinz on the 21st of October, Yeh says :-''The whole question amounts to this-a lorcha 7ailt by a Chinese purchased a British flag; that did not make her a British vessel." (Cheers.) I venture to say that Westminster-hall, with the Court of Chancery to boot, could not frame a decision more terse and more comprehensive than that. (Hear.} It is the whole law of the case. A Chinese by buying a Bnitish flag cannot make a Chinese vesel a British vesseL. And it is a most remarkable thing that during the whole of this discussion our authorities nver once attempted to answer this argument. (Hear, hear.) What is stUl more remarkable, Lord Cranworth talked a great deal about something else the other night, but he never attempted to answer it. I have no doubt we bhall hear the Attorney-General talk a great depl about somethig else to-night. (A Laugh.) But I venture to say that we shal not hear any man with a character to loe as a lawyer, much less a man who aspires one day to sit on the oo lsack, declare in express language th ththat dictcum of Commissioner Yehi is unsound in law. (ear, hear.) Here is another instiance. Yeh writes to our plenipotentiary on the 17th o' Novembsr:
"CI have always understood foreign lags to be each one pectuhar to a naton; they are never made so little of as even to be lent; how, then, could a foreign nation do an
thingasoirregular as to seliitsfaag toChina" y9 ancerve the acute reasoning of this man. He puts the quea tion at once upon its real footing-" You have not made a Chinest veel it vessel; yo have only sold your flag to a Chinese vesseL" (Hear, hear.) Ee then goes on (hear, hear)-
"This appears to yonr Excel7ency a proceeding in accord. ance with law: a7l I can say is, that wam not aware that foreign nations haveany such law;. As I have said before therefore, had the iv ag belonged bons p to a British merchant vessel, it would have been broperto follow some other course than the one pursued; but the fact beina that a Chinese had franudulently assame the la r why should Mr Consall Parkes have put himself for ard as his advocate i Simply because he wanted a pretext for making trouble."
(Hear.) Upon my honour, I believe the whole matter is contained in these last words. (Cheers.) I believe there was a preconceived design to pick a quarrel, and I very much suspect that there has been more than mere encouragement forwarded from bead-quarters. (Rsear, hear.) I might read numberless passages from the correspondence, but, at the attention of hon. gentlemen has already been called to them by the discussion which has ocuorred in another place, it is annecessary for me to tronble the House aith any lengthy te otations. I may say, however, that all, the cormenuicatons on the part of the Chinese authorities manifest a forbearance, a temper, and a desire to conciliate whicr put to the blush anvy man who asserts that they intended to Insult the Britishl repre3ent-tives.I observe that in another place Lord Clarendon did not contenthimself with referring to recenttransactions, bus he said that for a long time pae t the Chinese Government and authorities have been encroaching upon the rights of foreigners, and have shown a dispoition to infringe the articles o- the treaty. I can only say that if snch conduct has bean pursued by the Chinese authorities it wag the dUty of Hter at jety's Covernment to take earler stepsto checktheir proceedings. (Rear, hear.) Why did the Government allow us to mkjift into a quarrel in wehich our cause is bad, if for years subdicient grommds have existed for their interferenetr? (Cheers) If, as L ord Clarendon tells us, these wrongs have been inflicted upon rengesh, French, and Americanf, why, in the name or common reuse, did not that noble lord, or the Pieii Minister, or some one in authority, say to France and to the United States, " We are joint parices to the treaty
ieh China; our rights are invaded;* the terms of treaty axre. not fairly fulfl~led: let us make joint representations on the subject at Pekin." That wold have been a statesman. like mode of proceeding; but why did the Government allowr these infractions of the treaty to go on untilyou representatives have stuebled into a quarrel, aud commenced a war for which, in the opinion of yourbestlawyers there is no legal grounds? Was it statesmanlike to omit the opportunity of settinv matters right when everyone would have admitted you were justified in doing so, and then to take up this dirty quarrel in a manner for which all the waorld icl cry shame upon you? (Rear.) I deny that the assumption of Lord Clarendon is true. I say that if you refer to the blue-books that have been lid upon the table since 1842, you will find most strikc;ng proofs that the Chinese authorities, in every part of the empire to which we have access, have manifested the most consistent and earnest desire to carry out the terms of the treaty. I will make one remark with reference to the correspondence recently laid before us. Why was the blue-hook laid upon tle table on the very moring of the day on which Lord flerhytvwas to call nttention to the subject (hear, hear), and whly wvas a paper presented in the name of the Sovereign caricatured by being termed "Correspondence Tespeotin-i insults in China l" (Cheers from the Opposition.) My experience in these matters almost temp ti me to say that thie blue-book was laid upon the table on that morning for the very purpose of mystifying us. (Hrear ) Many hon. members-plain, simple-mindedcountrygentlemen(laughterl -who have not so voracious an appetite for blue books as I have (a laugh), would say, "Mercy onus! l ere is a hook of 225 pages, all about the insults we have suffered in China.
It's high time that Lord Clarendon should interfere for the protection of British interests, and it's quite right to go to war on the subject if necessary." ("Hear," and a laugh.) I have read tho blue-book through, and what is it? It consists of garbled extracts from correspondence extending from the year 1842 to the year 1856. What do those extracts relate to? A few street riots, a few village rows. An Englishman straying out of bounds to shoot is hooted back by the peasants. An Enelisbman goes out shooting, shoots a boy, and blinds him. The consul awards the boy S200 to buy a piece of land. That is put down as an "insult in Chins." ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) When I commenced reading the book I thought " Here is the record
Iarbled, as will afterwards show you) of all the disputes and the misunderstandings 'we have had with China since we concluded the treaty which gave us access to the five ports of that empire." Now, I will ask the Houso
to turn their attention to the position occupied by this country during the same time with regard to the other great Powers of the civilized world. What have been your relations with the United States during that period? Three times you have been on the vergo of war on the subjects of boundarydisputes enlisteno t disputes, and fishery disputes. Hear, hear.) I have seern a large fleet at Spitbead reviewed by theQueen, well knowing at .ne time its significance-that it was meant to back the representations wo were making to those who are our co religionists, and I may almost say our countrymen. . (Hear, hear.) Then1 what has been our po5ition with regard to Franco? Twnce we have debated the measures to eo adoDted in order to guared airnt the po5sible descent of tbv Prhnch npon our shores. We have called ont-ons militia and ws- have inereme our {seb for fear ef'volent ProceedIngs enthe partof France. What
have been the ations existing between Englnd and ussia? ThosePowers havdngaged ia the most gigantic del ever fouhst; they b3ve waged the most bloody and
obscure part of the world, where England adopted a courso against a semi-barbarous people, without any intelligent and civilized people to judge of their conduct. They were done in the face of a great European oommunity,-in the face of a great community of English merchants-men who carry with them through the world the feelings and opinions of Englishmen-men whom I believe the hon. gentleman has libelled when he says that they advised the British authorities to adopt at Canton a course against which not only every English, but every Christian and every human feeling revolts.
Mr. COBDEN.-No, no!
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-Yes ! I appeal to the House whether that was not the manner in which the hon. genIleman thought fit to stigmatize this great body of English gentlemen? I(Hear, hear.)
Mr. COBDEN.-I beg the right hon. gentlemans pardon. Let him specify what I said. (Cheers.)
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-I will specify reasons why I state that the hon. gentleman spoke thus of them. Tha hon. gentleman said that the judgment of the whole British community was warped by their own mercantile and selfish interest, and that they were blind to those considera. tions of humanity) which ought to have had weight with 1hem. (Cries of "No, no !" and "Hear, hear.") I, Sir, have a very different opinion of Englishmen in any quarter of the world. I have never been personally engaged in commerce, but my family and my connexions have all been in trade, and I have learnt to form an estimate of the character of the British merchant very different from that vihich appears to have been formed by the hon. gentleman. (HeXar, hear.) He has drawn a very affecoting picture of the violent and high-handed proceedings of the British representatives at Canton, and has contrasted them with the forbearing, just, and scrupulous spirit which has characterized the conduo. of the local Chinese authorities. I will not insist upon the fact that the entire Europeaumer. cantile community at Canton appear to have approved these proceedings, and that we have not received from them the slightest protest against their justice and policy. I will not even insist upon the sympathy displayed by the French and Aimerican residents in that part ofthe country, although the consul representing the latter nation pushed his martial sympathies so far as to acconpany oUr troops on their ad. vanee to Canton; but I will appeal to testimony to which I ihink the hon. gentleman himself will attach some oinportance. I hold in my hand a letter addressed b the American chief superintendent of ltacao to his fellowcountrymen, in which he expresses his opinion a to the general character of the Chinese administration at
lanton, and as to the manner in which it is necessary to deal with the authorities there. This document is not included in the papers already Presented to the House, because it has only just arrived, but it will appear in the next batch of papers, and I will take the liberty of reading it to the HOUsE. It is dated Dec. 27, 185f, and was issued from the legation of the United States at Macso. It is to this effect:
"To the Merchants and other Citizens of the United States.
"' His Excellency Peter Parker, commissioner of the United States of America to China, &c., referring to the notice of the 9th inst., hereby makes known that the reply of the Imperial Commissioner to his Excellenc's despatch of that date was receivsd last evening, and that, with the semblance of a desire to maintain friendly relations btween the two countries, the same disposition to evade o4ligation misrepresent facts, and erroneously interpret treaty stipula. tions which for years has characterized the correspondence of Imperial Commissioners still obtains with his Excellency Yeh. The resumption of trade to any extent at the port of Canton during the existence of the local hostilities is not encouragedby the tenourof the communication now receivod, and means more ample than those now at command wi)l be required to meet the emergency of the public interests of the United States in China, and the satisfactory and proper adjustment of the relation of the five ports is an event yet future. "By order,
" S. Wxu.S WuLMAIVs,
"Secretary of the United States American Legation."
[r. Cobden.-What is the date ?] The date is Dec. 27, P856. I therefore imagine that it was put forward after the recent difficulty between Anrerica andc China was for the moment settled, and expresses, not the effects of anv temporary irritation, but the deliberate judgment of this, the chief American officer in China, as to the general .character of the proceedings of the local Govern. ment at Canton. (Rlear, hear.) The tone of this docu. ment is such that it might have been put forth by Sir J. Bowring instead of by Mr. Parker. Had it been put forward by the friends of Sir J. Bowring it would have been treated with very little ceremony by some gentlemen. I hope that as it proceeds from an American, and not from a Bntish commissioner, it may be thought entitled to more respect and attention. I believe the fact to be that for some time the relations of every foreign Governmnentand the Government of Canton have been so thoroughly unsatisfactory, and have been gradually becoming so much more so, that the foreign residents generally felt that the existing state of tbings was so insufferable and so detrimental to their interests that they were willing tbat, even at the price of the temporary interruption of commercial ntercourse (which must have been to them a matter of great injury and regret), the Chinese should be taught tbat they could not, without check, set aside treaty obligations and commit acts of violence and injustice against tho lives and property of Europeans and Americans. (Hear, hear.) If we desire to form a just decision upon this question it is necess=ry to bear these things in mind. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Cobden) has expressed a hope that this question will be de. cided without respect to party feelings. I heartily join in that desire, and I am persuaded that there are many members of this House who are determined to vote upon this subject not as Whigs or as Tores, not as Liberals or Conservaties, but as Englishmen jealous for the honour of their country (cheers), de..ermined to uphold her interests and her rights, and not to be led away by a resolution which, I must say, is one of the most ambiguous and obscure which has ever been presented to this House, I am afraid that we are getting into a very bad practice in regard to the resolutions proposed in this House; and that, no matter to what subject they refer, whether to our finances, our foreign policy, or any other question, a desire is evinced to give to the resolutions as little meaning as possible, in order to enable any one to support them who may happen to have a taste for voting against the Government. The result of this desire is, that instead of matters being fairly submitted to the judgment of the House, some vague, indefinite, purpose. less resolution is put together, which in reality affirms nothing, but the wording of which enables gentlemen of the most opposite opinions to go into the same lobby. I will stop for a moment to consider the resolution of my hon. friend the member for the West Riding. It begins by saying,-
" That this House has heard with concern of the confflcts which have occurred between the British and Chinese authorities in the Canton river."
Of course we all agree to that. We always hear of any interruption of tranquillity with regret, especially when the strength of the contending parties is so unequal as it is in the preEent instance. The hon. gentleman then goes on to Say,-
"And, without expressing an opinion as to the extent to wbich the Government of China may have afforded this countrY cause of complaint respecting the nonfulfilment of the treaty of 1842,"-
Why, Sir, I should think that it is quite necessary for the House to consider that, if they mean to come to any conclusion. (Hear, hear.) I am nrprised that the clear Intellect of my hon. friend could have framed a resolution by which he asks the House to come io a conchlsion without consider. ig the cause or the amount of the grievance. Then mark the logical nature of the conclusion,-
"This House considers that the papers which have been laid pon theu table fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resorted to at Canton in the late affair of the Arrow.",
How can you say that, irrespective of the opinion you may form fromn the papers as to whether the Chinese authorities gave us just cause of complaint or not ? This is the most singularly illogical resolution I ever heard propounded in this House. To his series of inconsistent and incongruous prpositons the hon. gentleman tacks on these -words .- Tlhat a eclect committee be appointed to inquire into the state of our commercial relations with China." The appointment of such a committee may or may not be desirable. That is quite a distinct question in itself, and does not follow as a inatural or necessary coroUary from the preceding parts of the resolution. In one of the shortest, but by no means the worst, speeches ever made in this House the hon. and learned member for Midhurst (Mr. Warren) the other day said,-"Only imagine a proposal to refer the Britisli constitution to a select committee i" lEqually preposterous is the idea of referring the foreign relations of this country to such atribnnal. (Hear, hear,) No; if this House thinks that the local authorities of Hongkong have erred in demanding redress for what they regarded as an unwarranted aggression-il it thinks that we ,iave done wrong in approving thec onduct of our offlcials let it frankly and manfully say so in clear and inteUiigible language, and we wfill do our beatto meet it; but let not the House allow it to go forth to the world that it agrees to amsottion every sentence of which conflicts with the one that immediately followfs it. I am unwilling to entr ngle myself inm the thorny legal argumentS raised in this case. Any
omon fot mme on such poits would carry no -weighti, andI! erefore leave them to my hon. and learned friends who
have studied this part of the subject. They have no essential bearing on the question at issue, which requires no legal subtlety or special knowledge to understand it. With regard to this lorcha-the causa teterrima of the whole dispute-let the House not confound two classes of British registered vessels, both authorized to carry our flag but between which there is an important distinction. The first class is one entitled to an Impelial register with all its incidents. These vessels, when our navigation laws were enforced, were liable to many restrictions as to manning, ownership, &c., and their privileges were jealously guarded; but from the very exigencies of trade another category of ships has always existed, entitled to a colonial or only paria regi4ter, the forms attending which are far laxer in their nature. The Mediterranean pass system has existed for more than 200 years, and under it vessels trading with Malta or Gibraltar, and not at all British built or British marned-in some instances not even British owned, were authorized to cam our flag and claim our protection. In 1825 an ordr in Council was issued for the purpose of investing any ship or vessel "with the national character of a British ship" (the House will observe that no words can be larger or more explicit), and it declared that vessels trading with the Mediterranean should be entitled to this privilege, although they had not been built in England, were not manned b Englishmen. and not even owned by native-bom British subjects. These rights were not conferred under Act of Parliament, but by the prerogative of the Crown, and ihis prerogative has been exercisedb by the Crown in all times, either directly by aLn order inuCouncil, or else by amede equal to that,-viz., in the case of a conquereid or ceded colony,
by the local ei~slature, confirmed by the authorit of the Queen, lTow, it is under this latter form that licensee are
hear.) Yeh, however, holds to his statement that the Arrow Is a Chines,e vessel, and he hits the right nail. on the head, iand Is strictly within the limits of the international law,
'when he says so mildly to Sir John B3owring, with a view to prevenit d4sutes- In future, "1I would be obliged to your Excellency if you would not give an English register to a Chinese ship-" I was supied to hear the Colonial Secretary quote the language of Mr. Consul Park-es asl something that was remarkably decorous and proper from an official of his rank. Will the House permit me to read a fewv words from a communication addressed hy Consul Parkes to Commissoner Yoh, not for the sake of its proper tone, but on account of its prevarication ? (A laugh.) Mr. Consul Parkes says :- "I have seen clear and conclusive proof of thb facts that your Excellency attenipts to deny." Attempts to deny! Where, Sir, in all Yeh's correspondence shall we find a phrase so gratuitously insulting as that? (HeaLr, hear ) it would have been quite as easy and more in conformi'ty with diplomatic usage to say "1Your Exceliency is nisinformed."1 Mri. Consul Parkes informs Commissioner Yeh that he has eeen clear ana conclusive proof that the Arrow had an English ensign hoisted and an Englishman on board-facts, he adds, of which there can be no further doubt or question. Here, Sir, there is mere than prevarication, there is positive untruth, for, according to our own evidence, there was no Egiha on board when the Chinese offiicals reached teM vssl.n The 'Englishman did not go on board till, after the weizure, so here we bave Consul Parkes deposing as to two facts being so clear and conclusive that there could be no doubt or question reseting them, while upon one of those "1facts" he goes diretl in theteeth of his own evidence. Iz Commissioner Yeh so very unreasonable when he refuses to believe it? Lord Clarendon, with somewhat uncouLrteons haste, asserts that it was evidently an afterthought on the part of Yeh to say that the Arrow was not a British ship. it is too much to ask Lord Clarendonx to condescend to look into the papers conicerning anycasebeforehi11; but if we had a Minister of less commanding capacity, who would descend to that drudgery, he would sea that, so far from its being an afterthought, Yeh states in his first letter that the Arrow was not an English loiclha. (Cheers.) Before the affair of the Arrow, in the casse of thetwo Chinese smu~glers whom we too'kiunderourprotection, theChine,eauthoritiesusd exactly the same arguments,-viz., that a Chinese vessel cannot be altered into an English vessel; and they not only said that, but acted upon it. The case of an official is greatly a"gra. vated when we find Sir J. Bowring deliberately stating"ihot this vessel, for which we are committing such havoc of law, of order, of property, and of life, is not legally entitled to our
prtectio. Sc is the statement mnade by Sir J. B onin toMr.ConulParkes, and yet those officiaIs not onl cotiue o ugetheir clatim upon China, knowing it to be njut, ut heyproceed in the deception, step by step, to te bmbadmet of a city containing 1,000,000 inhabitats. Chees.)I was not astonishedL at the thrill of indignaion th t rntrouih the Houtse when the hon. meomberfortheWes Riing, with that peculiar and enviable elouneo his, alluded to the miserable argument that the Cieeddnot know the true poition of the, Arrow. WySi,here we have not only th;e telling of a lie, but the suppression of the truth, and this contemptihle excuse for a great crime Lord Clarendon, a, Minister of the Crown, does not hesitate to se-echo and aLpprove. (Hear, bear,) In the magniloquent appeal with which the Colonial Secentary concludea hig peroration he talked loftily of vindicating the henour of the nation. The honour of the nation! Sir, prevarication and falsehood have nothing to do with the honvor of the English nation.- they appertain rather to the honour of an O'ld Bailey at' torney. (Cheerm) We have heard a great deal aLbouit the dissimulation and duplicity of Russia. I think, Sir, Russia will chueckle at our dealings with China. Here is a Minister of the Crown, the austere ne. otiator of the Paris Contference, the rebukcer of Russian duplicity, aiding and abettig in what hen ma aladiplomatic suppressionof the truth. (Alaugh.) But anotherexcuse has been advanced. It is saidthatbythe 10th rule of the ordinance the register of the Arrow might continue in force f or more than the year for which it wias granted. That is not the case, and the argument was not thought of at the time. It never occurred to Sir J. Bowrieg, who hiad no doubt that the vessel was not entitled to our protection, and it was never mooted until the town had been bomabarded. The proviso in the 10th rule, upon which the excuse is founded, refers to the claims of the owner to renew the license, and not to the continned force and effect of an old register after its expiration. This simply means that if the vessel is detained at sea by unavoidable circumstances, the license may be renewc4, notwithstanding that irregulariy, but it does not mean that t-he force and effect of the license shall be continued In, the intervaL. If you look at the ordinance, that would be found to be im~possble, because no limit as to time is plaed duriing which the vessel might be akt sea; and therefore, according to your construction, the vessel miight remain out many years and the license still have force. It is quite clear that Sir J. Bowring interprets this part of the ordinance as I do. Then I ask what remainas but the maost special pleading by which violence can be justified ? The right hon. ctleg ean s-aid that there had been no desire to quarrel with China;- but I ask if the Government had not pro-
'eetermined upon thse hostilities, what better moment could have been chosent to take us out of this affair with dignity than when Lord Clarendon hear that. the license of the vessel had expixecl (Hear, bear.) How well miht we have said to the Chinese (rtii. h ihttotought proper) that we had found a technical difficulty in the fa,t of the expiration of the vessel's license ; and as it Was doubtful whether she was entitled to the British fla n as we were a nationri ngularly just, and lived lunder a Government
singularly humane (cheers and laughter), youx shall have
the benefit of the doubt. Then if we w,ished to gain an entry into the city of Canton, we might have made much of our forbearance in this matter. (Hear, bear.) If, however, we were too candid to own that we could be the least in the wrong; and if it were necessary for the dignity of this country not to suffer the least affront from Chino, then I say that when we captured a Chinese junk with a'valuable cargo instructions should have beenx given that that capture was a sufficient reprisal. (Cheers.) But, if that was not enough, we miglht have stepped short after homharding the Barrier forts. (Hear, hear.) It is a stain on the 191 cantury that we hurried on to the destruction of the city and its population, and those parts of the city, too, which affect our subjects. (Chcers.) And all for what?7 In order that we may convince these barbarians how very unenlightened is their prejudice against foreigners. (Cheers.) Then there comes this new feature of the case-the alleged infraction of the treaty of Canton in not adniitting the English into the city of Canton. Now,
I am going to raise the question a little miore boldly than it has been raised by the hen, member for the West Riding; and I would ask the noble lord at the head of the Govern. ment, than whom no greater authority exists as to the law of nations, whether, Jacording to the law of nations, as interpreted by all authorities, the Chinese Emperor maxy not feel specially exempt from. the fulfilment of this part of the treaty. It is a most essential element, in respeot to carrying out the terms of a treaty, that its fulfilment should be practical and not pernicious to the state and people of the Power that enters into the enga_-ement. Nothing was more clearly laid dow;n by Vattel than that p reposition. There is the well-
known instance of Lo*uis XII., who was called on by theI States-General of France to break his treaty with the Emperor Maximilian andi the Archaduke Philip, on the ground that it was prejudicia to the French people. There are manyotther examples besides, Then, I ask, are youx srthtthe Emperor of China can practically effect your entrance into the city of canton; and, if he could, would not that act be pernicious to his State? We know little of the political consttittion of China, but it is perfectly clear that it differs essentially from all. moderu Oxlentzl. nations. *When the French missionaries first went there they were struck with the s"iilarity of the manners of the Chinese to those of the ancient E?Ptizns, and one wrote a work to prove that Chiua was acolon from ancient Egypt. However that may be, there existsinChsin.a!are~ligious respect for the
feligs, custenas, and habits of the peeople whichx the CneeEmperor could nutventure to make light of. It is therefore perfectly cleaLr that he could not practically enforce our entrance into the city of Canton. If he attempted to do so by a violent exercise of prerogative, the attempt mnight be fatal to him at a time when his empire is rent by rebellon.
The Emperor of China has admitted us into every.
potinto which it was possible for him to give us
adisin He does no' admit us into this port of Canton because he canLno, do so. Ought we, thein, to insist upon obtaining what we are assured would be perricious to us? One of the highest authorities on international law says that when a treaty, which has been concluded with upright intention's, becomes difficult of fulfilment, nothing could be mnore honourable, more praiseworthy, or more conformable to the histories of international treaties than to relax the terms of such treaty as ffar as possible without exposing yourselves to danger. How much more, then, is it our int-erest to do so in such a case as this where we run the risk of considerable danger and loss ? I ask- whether yout could have any miore unhappy occasion for attempting to enforce this treaty than the pres~ent ? The right hon. gentleman tells the House that this is niot the first time that China has insulted us. IRecollect that it was in 1852 that Sir J. Bowring first commenced his operaLtions. And what was the reason urgcd by him for pressing forward our claim? Why, he says, the Chinese are in a state of unusual tranuility, and the prejudices against foreigners are 'au usdig And that was the moment ini which Sir 5 oigi i n nocent simplicity becomes animated wt h otfinl intentions and desirous of entoiing the iyo atn h
whole of this question. was brought inL 189bfoeteol
viscount now at the head of the Government. Sir G. Bonham was then the representative of this country in China. I am sure that more admirable despatches than those written at that time by the noble viscount on this subject I have never read. (Cheers.) Sir G. Bonham fairly put before tbo noble viscount all the bearings of the case. He stated all the disadvantages that would occur from not enforcing the treaty. The pretence that the Chineso would not be afraid of us unless we had recourse to host5lities, and all that sort of rubbish, was urged with as much force then as now. The nobte viscount, iu one of his admirable despatches to Sir G. Bonham, said that an entrance into Canton would not be of any mateiil advantage to Biltish interests (hear), while an attempt to enforce that entrance might lead to serious consequences. It was thought on all sides to be very undesirable to obtain an indiscriminate entrance of British subjects into Cantoni. It was only asked then, as it is asked now, that the Bs;tish Consul should be allowed to go to the Chinese authorities on special occasions. There is no doubt that that would be very desirable, yet the noble viscount wisely decided in 1849 that it was not worth mlitary and naval operations, and, while he did not renounce the treaty right, he not only resolved to suspend it, but so resolved from reasons that apply more strongly at this day than they did in 1849; for if the treaty were ever to be claimed by force of arms, then, while it was fresh, was the time to do it and your right is much weakened by its tacit suspension for eight years. If your main reason for not enforcmg it then was the prejudice of the Cantonese against yon-a prejudice which the noble Tiscou:it so wisely left it to time to softon -hoW much must that prejudio be increased when you urge admission at the very mnoment you have been bombarding the forts shelling the city, incen the pblee andleavingevery man whobaslostasonoraibrothehtiing for revenge !

banded them over to the British Crown, and though he had ceased to perform towards them any of the functiong of a Sovereign, were sti to be regarded as subjects of the Emperor of China, and that therefore we could not by any Law diminish the right of the Emperor of China over them. This, he contended, was a harsh and strained construction Of that miaxim, and one which could not be justified by the Cicumstan mof the case. The maxim of those who e ed thus ought to be pthr em, n inemh ezuere, because,
ertainly, all a country ould do to cast off its citizens had Already been done by the Government of China with reference to the inhabitants of Hongkong They were now under the dominion, not of the Chinese, but oflthe Btish Crown. The British nation owed Protection to them as much As to the inhabitants of any other Portion of the British domlinions. Theymight not he subjects ofthe Cronin the ordin parlance--in the same sense as the Rioabitanta of ontheso iles wee, or even as their own children would be at a future time, but stil they were qua subgjecits. weex erciaed power over them, and they owed agace to us. We had duties to perform to them. They were cat off by their own Government, and it was our duty to protect them, and to throw over them the i of ourpower. he submitted that thigs point had no en sfficiently considered, and it seemed to be supposed that we were seeking bg our municipal laws to deprive the Emperor of China
rhis ights over a portion of his subjects living in Chira. in the name of humanity he wouda as the Hosoe to consider what condition could be more deplorable than that of the Chinese inhabitants of Hongkong if by the cession of that place to the British Crown they had lost the protection of their own Government without acquiring that of any other, if they ceased to be Chinese citizens withount becoming British citizens, and if thiwere to
loerall the rights theyq had inherited from their forefathers ? He apprehended it was upon this ground that the ordinance of which they had neard so much was passed. Tho persons engaged in trade with Chins, as it was natural they should do, and it was considered right to register their ships, and to give them, not the same rights as British subjects, but a qualified or local description of rights for the purposes of trade with China. He would not now ague the question whethier that ordinance was legal or not. He submitted that the intention was just and benevolent and if by any flaw in the law that intention hiad been frusrated, as it was contended that it had been, he thought it was much to be re-
etted, for he conceived that the Chinese inhabitants of gongkong had a strong claimA upon the jnsiice and consideration of Parliament. The question as to the ordinance was a very simple one. A noble earl had argued in another place that that ordinaner was void, because it was not passed in pursuance of the 547th section of the Merchant Shipping Act. The ordinance could not have been pased in pursuance of that section, because the ordinance came into force in the colony on the 3d of Marec, while the Act did not come into operation until the lst of May. He maintained that the ordinance was legal in its inception. Ther ws- nothin to prevent the Lo gkslature of the colony from a year,their qualified registry to Chinese ships, and i a o t mhe who disputed the legality of the registers to show that there was anything to invaidate their effecat The right hon. baronet opposite (Sir L. Bulwer) had contended that, in this insthne, the register had lost its affect because the year eor whch it was granted had extred while the ship was at sea and before its return to prongkong, and he relied upon the grammatical construtction of the section indspport of his view. He (Uit r. Lewe) contended that no judicature would put upon the Act so mnonstrous a construction as this-thaLt a vessel leaving the colony of Hongkong, and being at ea for a year, might, on the 365th day, have a right to fly the British flag andt t
claim British protection, but that on the 366th day-having beena kept at sea by stress oZ weather-it should absolutely and immediately lose the protection of the British flaT and be exposed to any degree of contumelous and insolee n treatment, without havinag the slightest clime to protection. This conclusion was sio monstrous that he thought the human mind would refuse to adopt it, and he felt no doubt that if the statut was referred to the construction of a competent tribunal, although there might be some little grammaetal difficulty, the clause would not be hel tosantio suh a aburdty.Thereo was another poithe which hadnotii been menioned, and which he wishedto pressyupon the aofiin of the House. The wuestion atissueh wasiwhethr orendot the Chinese had volaunedathe sharticle ofbthe tadety. That article was in
"If lawless natives of China, having committed crimes or offences aginst their own Government, shall flee to Hongkong, or to the English ship of warn, En lish or merchat ships, for refuge,it, if dIcvered by the EingUha
offdiers, be handed over at once to the Chinese officers for trial and ishment; or if, before such discovery be made by the Englis officers, it should be ascertained or suspected by the officers of the Government of China whither suchl criminal and offendes h ave fled, a rommunication shall be made to the proper English officer in order that the said criminals and offenders may be rigidly searched for, seized, and, on proof or admis sionx of their guilt, delivered up. 'In like mnanner, if any soldier or sailor ,or any other person, whatever his caste or
coutry, who is a subject of th Crown of England, shall,
fom any cause or on any pretence, desert, fly, or escape into the Chinese territory, such soldier or Ealler, or other
ersn, tshall be apprelended and confined by the Chinese thities, and sent to the nearest British consular or other Government officer. In neither cae shall concealment or refuge be afforded"i
The Chinese oflicers, however, did not make to the British Consul the colwmunse. Lion remuired by the treaty, but they took the law into tiir own hands and seized the crew of the lorcha. Suppose, however, that ,nstead of seizihg the crew, the Chinese mandarins had made the proper applica. tion to Mr. Parkes, the consul, and had said to him,"BOn board a lorcha, now in the Canton river, flying the englizh flag, and having the name printed in RHaran and Chieseletters, there arinotorgouslialtes who have offende
agais the laws of China, and we demand that they

SpoeM.Pre had replied, "That oha is not an ceng of merhat ship, and I shall not interedere," wht word woe thav been turneu gh to express t th ifrt thom the West Riding at the er ibbling, the paltrybevasion, the wretched sophistry of the English authoritie Hear"and laughter), who, h e a colonia ordinanc to give the vesCel the charace o a British ship, and having suffered her to fly the British flag, then turned round and sheltered themselves from the performance of their treatyengami enle tsunderthe paltryquibbletbat theregister was a ccolorni, and not an Enplish register? (Hear, hear.) If this woult have been tru of the English authorities, was it not equaly true of the Chines c (Hear, hear.) After all, however, the main point in this case was not a mcre question of legality,hbut aquestion as to the antoua of the Chinese authorities. (Hear, bear.) If the cnrimus of the Chinese authorities was and fair towards the British representatives, anduif they had only been mnisled in their proccdings, hle thought the occurrences that had taken place could not be sufficiently regretted. Butrhewas sorry tovsay that many circumstances rendered it impossable to come to that conclusion. He would not dwell upon the long course of outrages which had taken place from the peace of 1843 down to the present moment. He would callthe attention of the House to a document which showed that thevoeryiquestion which arose as to the Arrow had been brought by the aiuthoities of Hon,akong before the Chinese Goveinment. They knew, therefore, what w.as likely to ensue if they took the~ law into their,own hands;but withfuhllm owledge ardnotice of the consequences they chose to do so. The 12th article of the suppletentary treaty provided thatif the Chinese authorities detected vessels engaged in smuggling they should proceed to seize and contiscate the cargoes, but that the ships should be givenilup to the British offiials. In a letter addressed ri to Commissioner Yeh, and dated November 21, 15, the following pwasages occurred:-
ftSir,-ama Consul Alcoak has forwarded me copies of his correspondence with your Excellency regarcing the seizure and detention by the Canton Customs of certain British lorchas alleged to havesceen engaged in salt sin uggaang. It is brevid bfty article 12 of the supplementary treaty thalt ifpany ritsde h v l be detected psuggling, the Chinaoe
authorities shall be at liberty to Iheize and confsisate all goods, whatever their natureor value, that may have been so smuggled; and may also prohibit tbeo ship from trading further, and may send her away as soon as her accounts are adjusted and Paid.' Such being the course prescribed by treaty, the Canton Customs, in'se'iznad im tlnth
lorchas in question, excetdc fi their autority and committedl a breach of treaty. The Consul applied to your Excellency, and was told that the vess-ls were pseudo lorchas owned by Chinese, and that British sClbjects were inno way conctrnued."
That was the precise answer given in the case now under discussion, and which some hon. gentlemen contended was abon, ofid answer on the parat of the Chinese authorities. Sir J. Bowfing said,however,-
'IYour Excellency seeoms not to be aware that Honogkong being a British possession all persons, English, Chinese, or othr, her reidig my pocue rgisersfor boats owned
of its conditions, as your Excellency will see, is the giving of a bond by wh ch the owner and twvo sureties bind themselvezs, under a penal sutm of $1j,000, to comply with all the
provisions of the ordinance affecting registered vessels, and
with all laws binding on British subjects with regard to trade in China. The allegation of smuggling having been made within the port, the smuggled cargo alone was seizable. Over the vessels the British Consul alone hadjurisdiction; and his appeal to your Excellency was made, no less with a view to the due punishment of the parties offending, than in consideration of those interests which it is his duty as consul to protect. I have applied to our naval authorities to recover the vessels uvlawfully detained by the Canton Cutooms. They have retaken them, and I shaU nor
proceed to punish the guilty parties for their breach of the ordinance."
It appeared, therefore, that ll months before the occurrence which led to the present discussion a similar event had taken place-the seizure by the Chinese, under the 12th article of the treaty, of a vessel while they were only empowered to seize the cargo. On that occasion this colonial ordinance was brought to their attention, and they were told the vessels would ba retaken by force, and were warned not to pursue a similar course in future. If the Chinese authorities had then made any remonstrance to the British officials with reference to the colonial registers they would have been entitled to the utmost respect, hut no remonstrances were made. The lettsr from which he had read extracts was allowed to remain on record for 11 months, and then, in the fulness of time, when it was thought the proper opportunity had arrived, in spite of the warning they had received, they seized the crew of a British lorcha upon which the British fa was flying. He theught it was impossible to acquit the Chinese authorities of unfair animus in this matter (hear, hear), because, if they had really wished to capture the persons on beard the lorcha, the most direct asid easy course was to have made an application to tb e consul; and they could not have erred through ignorance, because the ordinance had been brought under their attention not long preNiously, and m must have been fresh in their midds. A nation niight, without loss of dignity, ask foir redress in a temperate manner, but it made a great difference when parties took the law into their own hands, and made a

Mr. L. DAVIES thought there was no logical connexion between the spaech and the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding of Yorkshire. If the motion had censured the Mintstry, he (Mir. Davies) should have approved it. Instead of asking the Hou te to condemn the Ministry for their sanction of the hostilities against China, the hon. gentleman had simply roved for the appointment of a committee to consider our commercial relations with that country. He founded his cpposition to this motion upon the conduct of the hon. meiiber for the West Riding (31r. Cobden) and those who sat rith him three sessions ago. They then, representing themselves as embodying the opinions of Englnd, sent delegates to the Emperor of RRussia, and forfified him itn those aggressive measures which led to the calamities of the Crimean war. (Hetlar, hear.) What was the paTallel now?2 The House w;as asked to appoint a committee nominally to inqusire into our commercial relations WitD China; hut its real effect would be to criyple our movements and paralyze our efforts in China, to give nerve to our enemy, and, in fact, to weaken where we oat tog strength. Upon this ground. and this only, nc shold vote gainst the motion. (Hear, hear.) As to the measures taken by Sir J. Bowring, there was no denunciation uttered by the hon. maember (£r. Cobden) or the hon. baronet (Sir B. Lytton), in which he would not fully coincide, but that was not the practical question before the House. To grant this committee would be to intimate to our representative and commanders in China that a sword was hanging over their heads, and would prevent their acting with the promptitude and decision which wa3 necessary. If it were meant to assail the Minstry he should understand such an assault; but he was convinecd that to appoint this committee would bo a most evil measure. The w are which had been carried on amounted almost to batcher, but he thought that the best course which the House could pursue would be to make such an impression upon the Government as would induce them to take steps to briLg the war to a close, and then they might properly and dis-
sionately inquire whether the English authorities in Mha had acted with precipitancy, and had jeopardized lives which they ought to have protected. He had intended to propose an amendment, but he had learned upon inquiry that that would have the effect of natrowinu the discussion, and he should therefore content himself withvoting against the resolutions. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. COBDEN explained to the hon. gentleman that his resolutions were two in number, and would ba put sep,rately. The hon. member (Mr. Davies) could therefore, if hc pleased, vote for the first and against the second; but he (Mr. Cobden) hoped that he would vote for both.
The SPEAKER said that there was) no distinction between the resolutions, and ho had put them as one. They must therefore, accordiag to the forms of the House, stand or fall together.
Sir J. BAUSDEX said -that if they were to discuss this question on the very narrow grounds on which, by the terms of the motion, they were invited to consider it, with the view of pronouncing a censure upon the British authorities in China, or rather upon the Government at home, which had approved their proceedings while at the same time they put out of sight the violation of the treaty, which was their alleged justification and defence, they would have very httle difficulty in coming to the conclusion unfavourable to their countrymen, to which the hon. mcmber for the West Riding (Mr. Cobden) invited them. Or, if they consented to join issue upn it as amere dry question of law, dependent upon nice legal techuicalities and points of casuistry, then he confessed that the papers before the House furnished ample materials for coming to the most contradictory conclusions. The speeches of those hon. members who had taken part in this debate had, however, broken away from these narrow restrictons, and had suggested several clear and unmniLakcable points to which the House must address itself, with a view to coming to a conclusion founded on those considerations of national polcy and duty which, as the hon. baronet (Sir E. Lvtton) had truly insisted. could be based only upon principles o morality and justice. The speech of the hon. baronet himself had suggested three questions:-Was the Arrow a legally registered British vessel, owned by a British subject, and as such entitled to British protection? was the boarding of the Arrow and the forcible abstraction of her crew a violation of the treaty ? and were the proceedings of the British authorities in China, in demanding an apology, and when that was refused adopting stronger measures, justifiable under the circumstances then existing ? He could not accept the invitation to put out of sight the question whether or not the treaty had been violated by the Chinese. In his opinion, that question lay at the bottom of the whole transaction, and must be held in view at every point of the discussion. (Hear, hear.) Nor could our position be prejudiced by the coanter-cbarge, that British merchants had encouraged the smuggling of opium. The great encouragers of that trade were the Chinese authorities themselves, who made their fortunes by it, and it could not be expected that we should aet as a police to protectthe Emperor of China against his own officers. This was really not the point in question, and any remarks upon this subject could only have the effect of diverting the attention of the House from the matter before it. Was the lorchs a legaly-registered Britsh vessel? If they accepted the opinion which had been put forth on high authority, that she could not be s unless her owner were a British subect in the ordinary acceptation of the term,that was to say, had either bcen bern in the British dominions or had receved naturalization,-then undoubtediy she was not. But, in addition to these two qualifications the Queen of England had, in the exercise of her urerogative, in some cases granted to residents in our co onia possessions the protection of the country in which they had settled. Accordngly, the colonial ordinance No 4, of the ysear 1855, was passed to enable forcigncrs or residents in HIongkong, foreisuers by birth, to obtain colonial registers under certain conditions, which were imposed as much in the interest of the Chinese as in that of the British Governnient. (Hear, hear.) Not only the legitimate coasting trade, but also smugglilg and pia had been carried on in these small vensels using the British flag; and, with aview to check this abuse, and to enable the Chinese authorities to distinguish between legitimate traders and smugglers, this ordinance was passed, ena'oilng the Governor of Hongkong to grant coloniai regishers to trading vessels under certain conditions. The registers were to he in force for one year, or until the vessel returned to the waters of the colony ; and. as to the constraction of this article, he must, with aU deference, differ from the hon. baronet opposite. The owner of the ship must be a registered lessee of Crown property within the colony- and a declaration of ownership must he made to the satsactiou of the Colonial Secretary. The name of the ship must be painted in Chinese and BIoman letters on the stern, and the master must be a British subject, or one Lonversant with the English language. The additional allicle of the treaty provided " that every British lorcha shall have a sailing letter or register in Chinese and Englisb, under thie seal and signature of the chief superintendent of trade, describing her ap5tarance, burden, c ;" ad thpt " every such lorcha sh report herself at Whampoa, and on reachinD Canton deliver up her sailing letter or register to the British Consul, who wiU obtain permission from the Hoppo for her to discharge her cargo, which she is not to do without such permission," under the forfeiture of heavy penalties. The Hongkong ordinance dealing with these vessels was communieated, as seon as passed, to Govornor Yeh, in a translated form; and then wps the time for tho Chine- e Government to make its objections known. Governor Yeh, however, whein o'r plenipotentiary sent him a copy of the ordinance, offered no objection to it, and his silence was therefore fairly assumed to amount to an aeqiescence. The Arrow was a registered British loreha, her owner was a registered lessece of Crown property within the colony, aud must have msde a declaration of ownership, with proof thereof. The lorcha's name must have been painted in conspicaous Chinese letters on her stern, and her masterwas an Englishman by birth. Then came in the additional articles of the treaty already described. On arriving at Canton with a British register she was entitled to hoist our flag; she was acknowledged by both the Chinese; and English authorities to be a British vessel, and was dealt with in that o_pacity. The Chinese authorities, however, learning that a notorious pirate was on board, were bound by the 9th article of the supplementary treaty to apply to the proper British offieerto have the man delivered up; instead of which they proceeded to the lorcha with a company of soldiers, tore down her flag, seized the crew, bound them, and carried them away. The concurrent testimony of four witnesses, two of them being Englishmen, proved that the British flag waD flying and that they saw the mandarin soldiers tear it down. Against this there was no evidence to bh set but the contradictory denials of the Chinese Commissioner, whose
letters, from first to last, were one tissre of evasinn. No doubt, that House ought to take a greater share in the mangcment of our foreign s~ffairs, and it was to be hoped that the day waa not far distant -when the representatives of the p'op!e would exercise a more wholesome and constitutional control over that branch of the national policy. The procccdings of our consuls, too, should be watehed with considerable jealousy, and the sacrifice of life involved in these tran'actionq uuqnestionably imparted to them a gloomycomplexion. It the papers ha disclosed on the past of the admiral and the consul any sign of anger or aniniosity towards the Chinese-any evidence of a reckless disregard of their responsihility,-un. doub:cdlly they wfould have deses ree the heaviest censure which Parliament could inflict. But he had seaiched the corresp-ndenco in vain for any proofs of such a temper. SiT *J. Bowring certa:nly fell into an error (the importance of whioh had, however, been magnified by the hon. member for the West Ridiug) in stating, on the 13th of October, that the expiy of her register disentitled the Arrow to our protection. Still that fact had no effect on the character of the insult, or on tho intention of the Chinese. Sir J. Bowring had to deal with this, not as an isolated case, but
as only one of a long series of insults with which the papers abounded. A careful study of the documents had impressed tim (Sir J. Ramsden) with admiration for the patience, iorbearance, judgment, and abilty displ3yed throuprhout a long period of years by the servants of Great Britain at home and abroad, and 'vnth sentiments of indigniation at the perfidy, cruelty, andlbaitiy of!thosewith'vhom theyhad to

you are not at war at present,-that Jou have nothing but a local quarrel at Canton, but then these new terms and this new treaty cannot be granted by the Governor of Canton. They can be grnted only by the Emperor of China. after a reference to Zekin, and a mature consideration of the whole interests of England and of China. For my own part, I have no wish to aee these operations entered upon. I fear
they might lead to a long and bloody contest. Itfear, especially in thepresent disorganized stato of China, that
eymigh produce such socil anarchy (hear,hear), such a complete rupture of all relations betwveen man and man in that country that it would cease to be a civilized nation,
-ese to be a nation with wvhich wve conld advantageously carry on commerial intercourse. And uncertain and m- biguous objects like these are the benefits for which we are to risk tho future prospects of our trade. An hon. gentle. man who has just addressed us spoke with some resentment of the conduct of the Chinese, and of various outrages, mnany of which were committed by low] vagabonds in viola. tion of their own laws. (Hear, hear.) He told us, at the Eame time, of the increase in the export of silkl from 3,000 to 50,000 bales, and the increase in the tea trade, we all know, has been enormous. Arethe prospects of a friendly commerce, so beneficial and so useful to us in every respect to be aU s',crificed in order to secure some vain chimera which Sir J. Bowring seeks at Canton? (Cheers.) And we, the Commons of England, are not informed at this moment what these demands are. How do we know that Sir J. Bowring may not by this time have framed new demands and looked for new advantages, or that our ships, our marines, and our troops may not be now engaged in enforcing them ? (Hear, hear ) A humopurous pamphlet, called Anticipaiion, was once written, in whicn Mr. Hartley is introdaced, and ridicule as cast on the common.place he is sent to talk as to the government of this country being vested in "King, Lords and Commons." But, if we are to be uninformed of these things-if hostile operations are to be carried on, and we are not to be apprised of them, I think the truism of Mr. Hartley will become a very wise anod wFeighty saying which wve all ought to take heart." My right hon. friem'c tha Secretary for the Colonies says that we are to emancipate China from its cruel and tyrannical Government.
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-I beg my noble friend's pardon. He has-unintentionaly, I am sure-misrepresented me. What I said was that I certainly entertained a hope that the result of these proceedings might te to emarcipate Carbon and its neighbourhood from the government of a man whom I believe to be one of the greatestpossible curses and inflictions to those under him. (Laughter.)
Lord J. RUSSELL-Here, at all events, we have a new demand. (Laughter and cheers.) We are not satisfied with the appointments which the Emperor of Clhina makes of his own govesnors; and tbus this gentleman, who is intrusted with the government of 10,0430,000 people, is to be removed, and somebody else put in his pline, vho may, perhaps, be recommended by our Foreign Secretary to the E mperores attention. (Renewed laughter and cheers.) In the matter of tendering advice to an independent Government I should have thought that our recent experience at 1aples would have sufficed to warn us not to interfere with the internal affairs of China. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) Commissioner Yeh may be a very bad governor. For a time we heard that he would probably be disavowed; but that does not appeLr to be the case; and the hon. gentleman who spoke last grve us reasons for believing that he was very high in favour with the Emperor, and is not a person at al likely to be removed-that, on the contrary, his views are likely to meet with approval from the Government of Pekin. If that be so, I think you had batter confine yourselves to demanding anything that you have a fair right to demand, but not all to meddle with the Emperor of Chlina's choice of the officers he will employ. Besides, how do you know that after aU the Emperor might not say, "Well, my commissioner may be a very intractable and violent sort of man; but I can't see that your own superintendent has so very mlld and easy a temper ?" (Laughter and cheers.) It is sad to think tnat the act of some inferior mandarin, probably, in the harbour of Canton, searching for a pirate and trying to make him subject to their criminal justicewith a doubtful, or even a bad case, it may be, in point of international law-should have led to consequences of bloodshed and destruction which cannot be too much deplored. (Hear, hear.) I own I am sorry to find that, among all the papers laid before Parliament-among all the approbation w hich has been bestowed upon the superintendent and the admiral, there is not a single expression of regret for the havoc and the miery which their acts have caused. (Hear, hear.) It would but have been decent that with their unqualified approval of the acts of our officials should have been mingled some word of sorrow for the dreadful consequences which ha1e flowed from them. (Cheers.) In other cases where a flag has been used to protect criminal pursuits I fud that my noble friend at the head of the Government has with indignation complainedof the prostitution of that flag. The flag to which I allude is that of the United States, when employed to protect the slave trade. (Hear, hear.) In 1840 my noble friend had a correspondence of considerable leegth with regard to various cases ir wbich it appeared that Spanish vessels, with Spanish o%.iers and Spanu crews engaged in the slave trade, had obtained liceuses from the American Consul at Cuba, and had then acquired the priv:lego f using the American flag. On that occason my noble frien wrote:-
" But there is an essential and fundamental difference between searching a vessel and examining her papers to see if ehe is legally provided with documents entitling her to the protection of any country, and especielly of the country whose fleg she may have hoisted at the time. For thoagh by common parlance the word ' flag' is used to express the test of nationality, and though, according to that acceptation of the word, Her Majesty's Government admit that British cruisers aro not entitled in time of peace to search merchant vessels sailing under the American flag, yet Her Majesty's Government do not mean thereby to say that a merchantman can exempt herself from search by merely hoisting a piece of bunting with the United States' emblems and colours upon it."
(Cheers.) Mly noble friend then proceeds thus .-
" Because what would be the consequence of a contrary practice ? What would be the consequence if a vessel engaged in the slave trado could protect berself from search bymerely hoisting the United States' flag 2 WVhy it is piain that in such case every slave-trading pirate, whether Spanish, Portuguese, or Brazilian, or English or French, or of whatever nation he might be, would immediately sail under the colours of the United States. Evcey cnminal could do that, though he could not procure genuine Ameri. can papers. Thus, all the treaties concluded among the Christlan Powers for the suppression of the slave trade would be rendered a dead letter; even the laws of England might be set at defiance by her own subjects, and the slave-traders would be invested with complete impunity."
If opinions like these had been prevalent at Canton our officials would have said, "' You migh; havo searched this vessel in order to see whether she had papers and having asked for the pacers yoa would have been told that her register was with the consul." Then it would have been discovered in a short time that the register had expired, and that, according to Sir J. Bowring's own law, the Arrow was not entitled to British protection. There the case woould have fallen (cheers), at least it ought to have fallen; but, unfortonately-and this is the worst part of the case, though I do not see that It bas been visted with any censure by the Government-Sir John Bowring, while declaring to his consul that the flag was not rightly used, and that the vessel had lost all right to British protection, stands up for her claim as against the Chinese 'omnmissioner (cheers), and bids him apologize for this insult to the Bxitish lag, which had been lawfully used. (Loud cheers.) We have learned much of late-a great deal too much, I think-of the prestige of England. (Hear, hear.) We used to hear of the character, of the reputation, of the honour o. England. I trust, Sir, that the character, the reputation, and the honour of this country are dear to us all (cheers); but, if the prestigc of England is to be separate from thoss qualities, if it is to be separate from the chrracter, from the reputation, and from the honour of our country, then I, for one, have no wish to maintain it. (Loud and continued cheers.) To those who argue, as I have beard some argueit is true we have a bad case; it is true we were in the wrong, it is true we have comamitted injustice, but we must persevere in that wrong; we must continue to act vujustly, or the Cbinese will think that we are afraid, I say, as has been said before, " Bejust and fear no:." (Loud cheers.) Whatever we lose in prestiQc, of which I do not presume to be a judge, I am convinced that the character and the honour of this country will be raised higher by such a policy. Never will England stand higher in the world's estimation than when it can be said that though troublesome and meddlesome officials (cheers) prostitute her arms and indtce a brave admiral to commence hostilities which never ought to have been begun, yet the House of Commons, representing her people, have indignantly declared that they will be no parties to such injustice (hear, hear); and that neither for commercial advantages, nor for political advantages, nor for any other immediate advantages to their country, will they consent to stain that honour which, after all, has been and must be the sure foundation of her greatness. (Loud and continued cheering.)
Mxr. OWE said he did not rise to answer the speech of the noble lord the member for the city of London, which
had been received with such signal favour bythe House but his object was to advert to one or two points which had not yet been noticed in the debate, and which were of great importance to the question at issne. This was not a question of the right of search, but of the boarding by an armedforce of a vessel bearing the British flag, and taling *out her crew. It had been maintained in the course of the debate that we could not by any municipal law of ours give to Chinese subjects any rights as against their own Governrment, and that, therefore, whatever law might be passed at Hongkong left the rights of Chinese subjects exactly as it found them. The first observation which he would make on that was thatit proved a greatdeal toomuch. Ifthatdectrine were carried out to its consequences the result must be that a great portion of British shipping would not be within this treaty, or within any treaty in which the nature of British shipping was not distinctly set forth. (Hear.) We should bo carried back to that which would be British shipping by the law of nations; and if no statute 'were allowed to enlarge the capacity of British shipping nothing could be regarded as British shipping which was not British built, British owned, and British manned. This was the legitimate and the somewhat inconvenient consequence of that doctrine. Another objection which he had to it was that it was not altogether fair to speak of the inhabitants of the British colony of Hongkong as Chinese subjects in the same sense as inhabitants of any other part of China would be spoken of as Chinese subjects. Hongkong was ceded by the Chinese Government to the Governmenut of England. the people went with the country, and thesovereigntyoverthembecamevested in the Britieh Crown. the supporters of the extreme doctrine laid down the 'maxim .Nemo patriane point Eera, *nd they maintaiD4d ithat theae person though the Emperor of China,
cbotmy wvi-for twe time of its duration-hati ever occurred,-a war In which four or fiva empires were involved I may bo told that China is now plunged into revolution; but within the bst 16 years has not al Europe been plunged into revolution? (Hear, hear.) Talk of insults to England I Were not all the English workmen in France driven from the railroads of that countrv If such a thing happened in a country whose manners, habits, and religion are similar to our own, ought we not, in dealing with an empire to which we have so recently gained admisson, and which has had so little con tact with the Western world, to have exhibited more tolerance and moderation? (Hear, hear.) Is it not an insult to this Rouse to bring down such a blue. book as that upon the table, in order to make up a case for Lord Clarendon, on the ground that we have had constant reasons to complain of the breach of our treaty with China? I have said I would show the House that the oxtracts cont?ined in this book are not fairly given. Many of those extracts are colected from returns which were laid before the House long ago, and I will trouble the House with some extracts from the original papers. Now, here is a letter from Sir John Davis, the r, itish plenipotentiary ddressed to Lord Palmerston, and dated " Hongkong, Feb. 15, 1847," which I have not been able to find in the blea-book before us -
"My Lord,-I deemed it right on the approach of the Chi,ese year, when Canton is crowded with idle persons, to address tho enclosed official desDatch on the 2d inst. to Captain Talbot, not that I have any exptation of the occurrence of acts of violence and disordor, it our own people wvil only behave with common abstinence.
" The foUowing extraet of a letter from Major-General D'Aguilar, now at Canton, will tend to corroborate all that Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane, myself, and the consul bave had occasion to report upon this subject; and we havo none of us any motives for seeking popularity by appealing to passion rather than reason-
" ' I have been a good deal on the river, and constantly in the streets about the factories, and extended some of my walks close to the city gates, and have never met vwith anything but courtesy and civility. I believe a great deal-I may say everything-depends upon ourselves, and that a kind manner and a bearing free from offence is the best security against aU approach to violence and insult."'
(Loud cheering.) Before I read a letter ina kindred spirit from Admiral Cochrane, I may observe that I havesometimes been accused of entertaining feelings hostile to the military and naval services. I have many excellent and brave friends in bcth servces, and, although I *m a friend to nea^e, vet in a question of veracity I wvould take the word of a solider or a
communicated to you of visiting Canton for the purpose of seeing, before my departure for England, the changes that may have occurred in the four years that had elapsed since I was lst there, as well as to ascertain how far any just cause existed for the apprehensions of the British merchants resident at Canton, or for a ship of war being constantly stationed off the factory gardens, to her imainent peril were any real hostilities to take place I went there from hence on Sunday and on Monday,landingin phain clothes, accompanied by my flag-lieutenant and Captain WDougal. I walked for fuU six hours in every part of the town where I thought it likely to meet a crowd, finding myself, without intending it, close to the dreaded city gate, within seven or eight doors of which I passed some time in a shop making purcheees, the doors surrounded as usual by lookers on from the crowded street that leads to the gate, of whom not a singleingividual showed the slghtest incivility. On the contrary, some in the most friendly and respectful manner examined the texture of my coat as well as my gloves, the latter being, as you know, a curiosity to them. Itn short, I sought every position where public feelUng was likely to be exhibited, and blinked none; and I can positively declare that I and those with me passed through the streets with as much freedom and as little inconvenience as in any street in London, and met with precisely the same reception I have done at Shanghai or Ningpo, and if any circumstance had been required to confirm the opinion I have more than once expressed,-namely, that the Chinese will never be the aggressors,-tho visit of Monday would fully do so; and if I required further proof of the buUying disposition of m own countrymen among foreigners in tlo first instance, and their unreasonable expectations as to anticipated protection afterwards, it will be found in what has already passed, and in the statement muade to you by the consul on the first recaU of the Nemesis, and another by her commander on his arrival here, that, on being ordered down the river after lying three months 'with',ut moving from the factory gardeus, the merchants made loud complaints, and I expected to have heard that she had been followed by a petition for her return. If the merchants would beliove that their best and by far most efficient protection is to be found in their own circumspect conduct, in treating the people vith urbanity and goodwill, and in avoiding rather than seeking sources of conflct, I feel persuaded that they wiUl soon practically discover in these measures more persusive advocates with the Chinese than in al the force I could bring against them."
I do not know whether my right hon. friend cau find that letter in the blue-book, but I have not been able to find it. The correspondence appears tome to have been cnUed to find some letters of a very different character. I will only trouble the House with one other letter. It is a letter by Sir J. Davis, written in 1846. You had riots at Canton afterwards, and great destruction of property. The letter is dated the 12th of November, 1846, and Sir J. Davis, writing to Lord Palmerston, says:-
"I am not the first who has been compeUed to remark that it is more difficult to deal with our own countrymen at Canton than with the Chinese Government (heir, hear) ; and I offer the last proof of this in the fact that it has cost me infinitely more trouble to make Mr. Compton pay a fine of 200 dollars than to obtain compensation to our merchants of 46,000 dolars for losses which occu,crd paitly from their own misconduct."
(Cheers.) Idonot find that letter in the blue-book. Sir John Davis also writing to Lord Palmerston, on the 26th of January, 1847, says:-
" I may add that the subjects of every other civilized Government get on more quietly with the Chinese, and clamnour less for protection than our own."
Lord Clarendon gave great prominence to the case of the merchants. Now, Sir, it is probable that Iam the onlyman who would say on this subject what I am about to say without being misunderstood. No one will doubt my mercantile sympathies. All my sympathies are with the mercantile classes, and my public life haS been Passed in enlarging the sphere of their honourable and beneficial employment. (Cheers.) It has been said that the English merchants are in favour of the violent proceedings which have been carried on in Canton. In one of these papers I find a communication on that subject, written in 1847, by Sir G. Bonham, who says that those wIso are engaged as junior partners and clerks at Canion, who havo not a large stske at issue, are naturaUy eager to have access to the country and to compel the Chinese to break down the barriers to their excursions, but that on consulting the older and more experienced men he did not find that they were in favour of hostile proceedings, although he admitted they were in a minority. I sympathize with the position of the Chinese merchants residing at Canton. It is not a pleasant thing to live on the borders of a river, and not to have a distance of two miles for exercise. At aU events, it wonld not suit me, who am fond of exercise, end I should be most glad to see them in the course of being emancipated from that state of duresse in which they are placed at Canton One of my reasous for regretting that which is being done is that it tends to retard indefinitely anT sach extension of the liberty of my countrymen. (Hear, hear.) Bat while I say this I cannot lose sight of the fact that there are a great many merchants in China who are engaged in a traffic of a very exceptionable character, which is detrimental not merely to thc health, but to the morals, to the souls and bodies, of the Chinese. (Hear, hear.) That trade is founded on a certain degree of license and lawlebsness, it flourishes in times of disorders and commotion, and any thing which nlanges the east in anarchy and confusion is promoting the interest of these merchants and servin' their unholy gains. (Hear, hear.) With those merchantsl have no .ympathy. I am afraid that those merchants do th some ex4ent merit the reflections mado by the gaUant men whose letters I have read. And I must say that I do not think it is for their benefit as merchants that they are placed in a position which enables them to summon to their aidsan overwhelming force to compel the authorities to yield to their demands. (Hear, hear.) If hon. gentlemen opposite
vill not take offence at a reference to a bygone question I should say that there may be too much protection for British merchants as well as for British agriculture. (A. laugh, and "IHear, hear.) It is a fact that while our exports are going on increasing they are passing more and more through the hands of foreigners, and not through the hards of Englishmen. (Hear.) I speak from ocular observation and personal experience when I say that if You go to the Mediterranean, or the Lovant, or to anv of the ancient seats of commercial activity, you will find the Euglish morchant, with all his probity and honour, which I admit is on en cquality with that of any other people, has been for some time in foreign countries decaying and declining. At Genoa, L-ghorn, Trieste, Smyrna, Constantinople you will find that the trade has passed out.of the hands of British merebants, and into the hands of the Greeks, Swiss, or Germass. all belonging to countries that have no navy to protect them at al. (Hear,hear.) This is the fact, and wha is the inference? It may obe that English merchants are not
ediucated sufficiently in foreign langnasges. But it may be
also that Englishmen carry with them their haughty and inflexible demeanour into their intercourse with the ratives of other countries. (I3ear.) The noble lord ascribes "Civis?Rornanus sum"on onr passports, in which maybea very gomd thingto guard us in our footsteps. But "COvi.sRomanus sum" is not a very conciliatory motto to put over the door of our counting-houses abroad. (A laugh.) Onr merchants have at present a very large trade in Cbina, in South America, and in India; h t the same faiings which have lost the footing of our merchants in the AlediterTanean may he also a disadvantage to us in China (Cheers.) I come now to the consideration of the case of the Chinese
merchants as it is put forward by Lord Clrendon, andI will take the me ori of theEastIndia and China Association of Liverpool. These gentlemen are telling our Foreign Minister wbat they wish him to do in China, and let hon. gentlemen hear what these moderate gentlemen wish to see effected:-
"That a revision of the tariff of Customs' duties should be made consistent with the rpirit of the treaty conclud:d by Sir Henry Poqtinger-namely, an ad 2irercm dqty of 5 per cent. on imports and exports."
That is certainly a tariff which I should like to see applied
to iverpool. ("gHear, hear," and lahter.) Let my Liverpool friends begin at home, and put themselves on the same platform witth the Chines.(fa,ha. hyte
go on to say:-e.(H bear,) They then " The British Government should insist on the rl ht of opening to foreign trade any port on the coast of China or
on the bank of any navigable river at any time they may tbink fit, and of placing consuls at such ports; that our alsiWp of war should have the free navigation of and acces to In te ports and rivers of China."
("Eear, hear," and laughter.) Let v, by way of llustr&. tion and bringing the matter nearer home, suppose that this is a document which has come to us from Moscow, and that
it is addressed, not to China, but to Turkey. Let u s red it thus :-" The Russian Government should insigt, on the right of opening to foreign trade any port on the coast of Tutrkey, or on the banks of any na'vigable river, at any timo they may think fit, and of placin nsils at suchy orts that Russian ships of war shourhanve the free navation of and wacess to all the ports and rivers of Turkey." (CheersaLnd laughter.) Can You imagine anythig more
n g than t h explosion whieh would take place at LiverTool if such a ukasLe as that were to come to us from Ressiab? As a friend, not an enemy, of these gentlemen, I must say that such language as that is to be reprobated. (Cheers.) I say it is to he rerorbated because it tends to place us who sympathie With mercantile men at a greht disadvantatc aseards even the naval ana mi tary classes. Contrast and conciliatory languare used by General D onAihlr and Admiral Cochrane with the downri.ht selfish violenoe and the unreasoning injustice with thich the Liverpool Association would treat an empire con. taining 300,000,000 peOPle. (Cheers) I thinik I know rore about the trade of China than these gentlemen, and I will venture to say that there is not a great empire in the world where trade is so free. I only wish that we had, not five ports, but one port in France, Austria, or Russia, where we should have the same low tariff as we now have in China. There is not a country on the face of the earth where trade is carried on with greater facility than in China. (Hear, hear.) There is no place where if you send a ship you can get her unloaded and loaded with greater despateh, where the port charges and other expenses are so moderate, or wyere you are more certain to find a cargo of the produce of the country. You wil find that statement corroborated by the evidence of captains who have sailed to every taear tUr of the globe, and who stated before a oonminttee..6f this House that there is no countrv in the world where tradUean be carried on with greater faclity than in Cta. Mr. Cook, the gentlemian to whom Ioave alreardy refered, confirtmel ithtone to-day. He said, "o I have seen anshi of1 5 tons coming into Whampos, and discharging her blat, takilng in her cargo, and sailing in five days." He added, "Can you mateh that in Liverpll I' Ilam afraid not. But what s itthat the Livess.We*1iationowant? Do they think that by oening C a dozen other ports they wm neesarlly,bgvy ioser violence, increase their trade
That was tried in the last war. it,se all remember the gloom which came over te untry ie the autumn of 1842. It was once remarked by Sir R.obert Peel that the fine harvest of that year and the news of the Cbinese treaty saved England from the most fearful state of panic and distres We all know that the report of the treaty with China when reoeived hero raised the must extravagant expectations. Our friends in Lancashire Chrew up their caps, and said, -in an em pire of 300,000,000
ople, and with free acoma to the souther ports, if every Chnamnan buys a cotton nightcap all our mils will be kept toin." What, then, has been the result to our exports? urg the lastthree a ers our exports to China have no' averaged more than 1,2 e0001. efiore the war broke out we had frequently years in which our mnanuifactured ex-
prts amounted to as much as that, In fact, since 1I4 we crav 1not added to otr exports to China at all, at least an far as our manufactures are concerned. We have increased our consumption of tean ; hilt that is all. I have here a
lettefr, m signed by my te hon.fin thexpce memeo aucather
ademwritte int( so difeet fa irit)°Phv from that ofuth iveort.
"Our trade with China has become one of the greatest
rtance. The import at the time of the treaty was, in 1842, 42,030,00Olb. of tea; in 1856, 8l7,000,o000lb."
It is hardly fair to compare these years because 1842 was
r year of war, while 184r was a year of large consumption. The statement in the lettier with respect to silk is stl more inaccurate. It is this Er
aIn 1842 (yearly average), 3,000 hales; in 1856, 56it hales."y
Well, that may be aceountdid for by the falsure of the sik crops in Fance and other parts of Europe, and it is an ilustration of the smnmenbe resources of China that when you have a sudden demand for silk, owing to the failure of the crops in Euro e,bysending siveryou can get any supplyyou want from China, no matter how unexpected may be the demand. But it is not fair to put that as the normal thae of our trade. (Hear, hear. edI have said that obr imports have increased. Those imports have been paid largely by opium. It is said that our exports to China have also increased. True, our merchants may send their lohi egloths to India, and there exchange them for opium; that opium may go to China, and in retign for it we may get silver baek to India or to England. But I apprehend that if the land in India were not employed nt growing poppy, it wouid be emploted in growing something else, ena ling the eatives to buy the longcaoths of England, and that if the Chinese were not sading large sums upon opium they too would buy our longoloths. (nrn, thear.) that ques tion, however, I shal not go into ; it is a very large one, and wouldhe apt touexcite agrypssions. WhatIowishoto say is, when the Liver Ioo merchants ask you to compel China to admit themi to all her rivers, accompanied by ships o sf war, and to allow them to set up their shops wherever they please, do not upon their authority he deluded into the belief that the war in 1842 has increased our trade with China, and tha anew war is likely to he followed by simila results. I venture to predict that the hostilities in which we are now engaged with China will. diinish, not increase, our trade. (Hear, hear.) Having trespassed so long upon the time of the House (cheers), I shall allude to orly one other poiknt- the claim o foreigners for admission to Canton. I the been careful to word my motion with a salvo upon that question. I am of opinion, whatever doubts may be entertained by others, that when the treaty was signed in 1842 it was contemplated that foreigners, asould have as free acces to Canton as to shanghai, or any of the other open ports. But a controversy has been carried on in good faith for years upon that suxbject between our officials at Hongkong end the authorities of Canton. In the papers will be found despatches not only from Mr. Bonham' but from the noble lord now at the bead of the Govenment (chcers), in which thevery best possible grounds are urged why our authorities at Hongkong should not persist in trying to gain admission forEnglish mnerchants to Canton. (Cheers.) It is stated, and I think in good faith, that the population of Canton, and, in fact, the population of that province of which Canton is the capital, is fierce and ung vernable; thatithey have hosti e feelings towards the Evnglish; and that if our mierchants were admitted into Canton the greater contact would only lead to greater ill-wi. h believe that apprehension is well founded. Whether it arises from the fierce and lawless disposition of the Chinese, or from their past intercourse with the East India Company-which we all know yielded much for a little temporary Peace-or whether it apertains to their southern clime-for in au countries the sout ern region is inhabited by the more fierce and turbulent part of the population-I know not; but certain it is that the Cantonese entertain feelings of the most hostile kind towards the foreigners, and I believe it was in good faith that it was urged by the Chinese Commissioner, by our own plenipotentiary, and by Lord Palmersten himself, that it was not desirable to press further the question of admission to Canton. (Hear, bear.) But let our merEcants bear in mnind that what we are now fighting for is no n their admission of foreigner into Canton. The sine
oid non of Sir John Bowring, who certainly, I believe with berd Derby, has a monomania about getting into Canton (a laugh), is that the foreign authorities, not the oreign m erchants should be allowed to enter that city. Is it worth while ehting for this -that Sir John Bowring should have the right to go into 3anton in one costume or another (hear hear), especially when the governor was ready to meet him half way out of the town? I always thought that if a person of state and dignity left his own palace to mreet another alf way it was a greaterncompliment than staying ad making tyhe reception at home. I cannot understand what we are fighting for, and why Sir 3. Dou ria t hould think himself degraded by an interview with Gm
vernor Yeh at Howqua's packing-house. This is a topic worth nothing but a laugh. (Hear, hear.) But is this admission to Canton for which we are fighting of any use? Canton is a walled city, occupie byanative population, witl
streets eight feet wide. Would Enga.shmen lve in such a
Cmnsnntiopl? l~ th haits nd heliiontofrthe twd
coud tke rie o awal fo exreie,that would be a beei othem; hut the population in h neighbouLrhood is tublnt and insubordinate, and our countrymen are not likely to receive good treatment there. But if admission to Canton were dirable, is this the timefor pressingfor it? Wbat lo the inhabitants of Canton say in their address? They say:-
"The late affair of the lorcha was a tiifle ; it wvas no case frde -setd animosity, as a great offence that could not be forgoitten; yet you have suddenly taken up arena, and for several days you have been firinig shell, until you hiave I urned dwellinDgs atnd dcstroyed people in uantold numnbers. (HeaLr, hear.) It cannot be either told how mnany old peple, snfants, and females have left their homnes in afflicotion.
(Ha,hear.) If your countr3 mnen have not seen this, thevy heave surely heard, have .they not, that such is the case'? What offeisce has been commaitted by tihe people of CLnten
nase sucn a calamity should befal them? Again, it has come to our knowledge that you are insisting on official receptions uithin the city. This is doubtless with a view to amicable relitions, but, when your only proceeding is to otPn a fire upon us which destroys the people, supposing
t you were to obtain admission into the city, stil the sons, brothers, and kindred of the people whom 3 ou have burned out and killed w;ll be ready to lay down their lives to be avenged on your countiymen, nor will the authorities be able to prevent them." (Hear, hear.)
There is great good sense in that ; and one of Governor Yeh's lotters might have been penned by the Duke of Wellington-it is so sententious. I alude to that in which Governor Yeh, in answer to Sir J. Bowaing, who asked for admission to Canton, stated that he could not go out of his palace on account of the people, who were complaining of the proceedings of the Enghish. On the same subject Governor Yeh wrote to Sir J. Bowring, stating that the Canton people were very fierce and eiolent; that admission into the citY of Canton had been refused in 1849 ; and that the people of Canton at the present day are the same as in 1849 * and that there was an additional difliculty in the vay of the admission now of the English, for the strong feeling against Englishmen was now aggravated by tho terrible sufferings to which thepeo.ple bad been subjected without cause. (Hear, hear.) That is perfectly natural, and should have put an end to the mooting of the matter at the time. It is important that hon. genelemen should address themslves to this point on which tbere ismumchisconception°of doors,narnejy, are the Chinese authorities in good faith when they tell you that they cannot with convenience or safety carry out that clause of the treaty vwhich provides for admission of the English into Canton! I believe that they aro in good faith, and the facts I think yrove that. A previous Governor of CAnton wrote to Ms Emperor describing the tumultuous character of the population and their anxiety to £ght, and the vapors already before Parliament are full of proofs of the kind. There is a communication from SirS. Bonhiam stating that when our merchants took some Csntonea aervnts to Foe-Chowr-Foe they rwere constantly found quarrelling and fighting with tho native
placed that he would take the liberty of reading it. It was as followvs:
" (Translation,)
"The absence of interruption to the peace of the country
is of tho same vital importancoe, in our opinion, as the mainli tenance of regularity in the avocations of its inhabitants. We now call public attention to the fact that in the province of Canton, from the earliet to the present times, bar.
barians have never been allowed to go into the villages. I Recently, however, a set of unprincipled vagabonds have been met with who, without any fear of shame or exposure carry on a secret intercourse with the barbarian dogs, and
combnine with them in a number of ways for working outI their orafty schemes. Night and day we see them entering the villages, and occasioning so much trouble by their irregulanitie , that gods and mien must unite in detestation of their practice.s. To judge of the extent of the evil to which our rovincial metropolis is thus exposed vwe have only to look to Shanghai tand Hongkong, and taL-e note of the iniquities that are there commuitted.
"Hereafter, therefore, whenever any harbarin dogs come within our limits, we ought, by calling together our fauiilies, to maintain the dignity of our city (or province), and, bravey rushing upon them, kil every one. Thus may 'we in the first place appease the anger of Heaven; in the second, give evidence of our loyalty and patriotism; and, in the third, restore peace and quiet to our homes. How great would be the happiness we should thus secure!'
In the face of such an atrocious, but characteristic document aa this, hon. members talked about treating the Chinese on the principles of the law of nations, and tauntingly asked whether we should have acted as we had if the dispute had arisen with America or France. Would America or France, he would ask, have issued such a proclamation as this ? (Hear, hear.) This was the first time that he had heard of intercourse between civilized and barbarian nations being governed by the principles of international law. Internationality involved reciprocrity, and could only be applied to natious who were so far in an equal state of advancement as to be governed by the same principles of morality and to acknowledge the same obligations of justice anid humauity. The question of access into Canton was now fairly raised, and he hoped it would b.a finally settled. He had no apprehension that we were on the verge of a serious war with Chin, for he found in the papers laid before the House a dooument purporting to bh the decision of the Privy Council of China on the Canton question, which completely assured him that by a firm polcy this dispute might be prevented, from swelling beyond a mere local quarrel, and might be terminated advantageously to both nations, and in a manner calculated to promote the permanent extension of the trade.
SirT. HERBERT said that, havingserved in China during the whole of the latowar, he naturally felt an interest in everything connected with that interesting country. He could not but deeply regret the commencement of another war, the more so as the necessity for it seemed to rest upon no just grounds. (Hear, hear.) The move he studied the oficial documents already furnished, and the more he had heard in reference to the untoward events, the more inexcusable did the conduct of our authorities in the Canton River appear, and the more did he deplore their il-considered proceedings. Admitting that the Governor of Canton had been ten times in the wrong, the violent course taken by our representative was one which he had expected to have heard censured, and not vindicated. (Hear, hear.) Considering that the whole of the crew of the Arrow had been sent back to Mr. Consul Parkes, the seizure and retention of one of the Imperial junks might have been supposed to be an adequate substitute for the apology whilch the High Commissioner was called upon to make, at least until instructions were received from the Home Government on tho subject. Surely tho circmnstance of the case were no justification for our representative, upon his own authority, ordering the admiral not only to destroy forts, but to bombard for three days a commercial town, containing a miUion and a half of inhabitants, involving an indiscriminate slaughter of unoffending and unresisting citizens. (Cheers.) It was said, too, that such a bombardment was an act of signal forbearance. Forbearance it was, with a ven;eance. He could not imagine how a British admiral, without any declaration of war, or orders from the Admiralty, could have been a party, and, as it appeared, a willing party, to such frightful transactions, and that he should think hewas at liberty and warranted to destroythe lives and property of a city'because it happenedto be governedby a man w. hom ho regarded as being guilty of the crime of pertinacity and discourtesy for declinmg his offered visit at his yanmun in the city. The admiral, however, did, without invitation, visit the Governor's yamun by force of shell and shot, but did not find his Excellency at home. And the admiralgave a proof of bis forbearance and Christian feelig as he seensed to take credit for abstaining froni the wholesale destruction of life and property on the Sunday, as a day of rest, and to perform his church duties. (Hear, hear.) He wished for the sake of humanity that the gaUant officer had exhibited somo real forbearance by not resorting to such extreme and - cruel measures until he had the sanction of Her Majesty's Government. The whole proceeding was one much to be deplored, and which he could not permit himself to think wrould be approved by that House or the country. (Hear,
Sir E. PERRY said that, as the motion before the House a,sumed the form of a vote of censure upon the Government, he thought it incumbent upon independent members of the Government like himself (loud laughter)-he meant independent supporters of the Government (a laugh)-to explain distinctly the grounds upon which they intended to vote. If the resolution had been proposed on the other side as a party motion, however strong might have been his conviction with regard to those grave questions to which it referred, he would have felt it his duty to give his unhesitating support to Her Majesty's Government (laughter), because he believed it was the best Government that could be formed under existing circumstanoes, and he would not assist any attempt of the Opposition to displace it. Tho motion having, however, been brought forward on that (the Ministerial) side of the House, and not with any intention of turning out the Government (laughter from the Opposition)
it appeared to him that independont members likehimself were bound to consider the meaning and object of the resolution, and if in his conscience he believed its terms were true and supported by facts, he would feel bound to give his vote il its favour. (Laughter.) Having necessarily paid much zttention to Eastern affairs he was impressed with the gravity of the question involved in the resolution. The questons raised by the resolution were two :-first, were the British authorities right in the claim they set up against the Chinese authorities ? and, secondly, if the right was on our side, were we justified in resorting to the extreme measures, which were, he believed, universally deplored in tbat House ? (Hear, hear.) The naked question of right was--were the Chinese authorities justified in seizing, in China, individuals who were Chinese subjects ? This question might be decided either by the recognized principles of international law, or by some modification of that law iLtroduced by treaty or by the usage of nations. Mr. Wheaton, a high authority on this subject, laid it down that, if there were no express prohibition, the ports of a State were considered open to the armsed and commissioned ships of a friendly nation, and that such vessels were exempt from the jurisdiction of the local authorities ; but that if private or merchant vessels of a State entered the ports of a friendly Power they were not exempt from local juris. diction, except by express compact, and only to the extent provided by such compact. If, therefore, no compact existed on this subject between China and England, the Chinese jurisdiction over the lorcha was founded on the clearest rights. He was satisfied that any hon. member icquainted with the law of nations would be of opinion that tho 9th article of the treaty had not the slightest reference to such a class of -cases, and was, in fact, merely an extradition treaty. He might give the House an illustration of his meaning by -a reference to facts with which they were familiar. There was an extradition treaty between France and England, but the other day, when it was ascertained that a notorious .criminal, who had been expelled from his seat in that House,'was residing within the French jurisdiction, it was found that his extradition could not be claimed because his offence did not come within the terms of tha treaty. But if Mr. Sadleir had come up the Thames in a French vessel, .although the tricolour flag might have been flying at the main, did anyone suppose that the British authorities would not have had the power, under the law of nations, of boarding the ship and seizing the culprit? (Hear, hear.) He might be asked if he maintained that British ships entering the waters of China would have no exemtion whatever. By no means, but on this broad prin^iple -that European nations in dealing with Eastern Powers had alwvays claimed an immunity from Eastern lw for all European criminals found within the jurisdiction of those Powers. It was, therefore, important to ascertain whether the Arrow was or was not a British vessel. If she was a British owned vessel, and the parties seized on board were British subjects, the English authorities were undoubtedly justified in demanding their tradition; but if these men were not British subjects, and if the vessel was unot entitled to British registry, they would not fall within -the category he had described. He had been surprised to heer it asserted by the Secretary for the Colonies-and he sawn similarstatement had been made elsewhere by theLord Chancellor- that the Governments of Crown colonies were entitled by virtue of the prerogative to override the general law of the land. He (Sir E. Perry) would take upon himself to say that was not the law, but the governments of Crown colonies had the power of legislating upon all questions upon which the Imperial Legislature had not decided. He would assume that the officials in Hongkong were en -titled to claim the reddition of these Chinese malefactors,
and that the English had a right under the treaty to enter into the city of Canton. But did the Chinese deserve the
terrible punishment we had inflicted upon them forrefasing -these demands? (Hear.) The sole principle of policy which
ought to govern our intercourse was that which had reFerenee to the mutual benefit of -trade. What had been the
relations between China and England during the last 15 Years, since the date of the treaty ? Our trade had increased not only in tea, but silk, and new articles of consumption had been introduced. It was quite true that British manufacturses were not taken in any great quantities. English
mercbhuts were at first delirious with delight at the prospect
of fiDding a market among 350,000,000 of the most industriots people of the East; but those anticipations had mot yet been realized. He wanted to account for the fact insisted upon to-night, that the English merchants -in China were the patrons, the fosterers. and the pro-
moters of these hostities. (THear hear.) Without casting *,spersions upon any body of menl he must be allowed to state what he believed to be the explanation why men whose pursuits were pacific and who sought for gain were goading on the Government to send out armaments and resort to hostilities. It was said that in the transactions between the English and Canton merchants the balance of debt was always in favour of the Canltonese. One English
merchant who had failed a ashort time ago was indebted -i thie large sum of $250,000 to a Chinese merchant. The speculations in tea were enormous, and the breaking out of hostilities must be highly beneficial to the holders of large storks, and very conTenient in enabling English debtors to
totlone paymouttothoir creditors at CantoL (Hear.) These = lmen at C*>bon-howero urgnu to send outfurther or6atnents were fiot called_upon to bear the income-tax or oAher burdens borne by4ue people at home. He was in-
formed, and believedhxt nearly all the English mercbauts at Cauton were enga edinthe illicit tratfic of seUing opium. It was calculated that 30,000.00 dolulrs' worth of opium was i-old every year by 'English merchants in China,
Snhabitants. But, under any circumnstances, I do not think that our admission to the city of Canton would be of a faribln3's use. There are thousands of inhabitants outside the was, and there are the shopkeepers and brokers. It is with themethat we do business, and if we he free aceasinto the city we should stiU have to do our business outside. Therefore, we have no grievance against the Chinese for not opening Canton. On this subject, supposing every. tbing I have said could be contradicted and invalidated, I have only to ask -whether it is right that, with respect to a country with which we have treaty alliances, our representative should be allowed to declare var and carry on war without sanction from this country ? Cheers) That is a question which I intend scarcely to touch upOn, because others will be able to deal with it better; ut it appears from these papers that the very difficulty wehave now fawenintowasforeseen, and SirJ. BowriDg has acted contrary to express directions sent to him. There are letters from Lords Malmesbury and Granville, and par. ticularly one from Earl Grey, which one can feel and understard; and these letters gave directions that on no account aggressive measures should be resorted to without recourse to England. (Hear, hear.) You have therefore to deal with your representative abroad, who not only has violated every sound principle of international law, but has gone against express injutntions. I perceive a great change in the tone of the correspondence between Sir J. Bowring and Lord Clarendon ar!d that which passed between him and other 3linisters with whom he had to deal. When Lord Clarcrdon caeoe into office there seemed to be some slackening of the rein, leading to the inference that the check previously held over our representative was withdrawn, and that we were " drifting" into a war with China, as we had into the late war, from the want of a firm hand on the part of persons in authority. Recollecting' the instructions of Earl Grey and the correspondencel which took place, I cannot help surmising that something must havetaken place to lead our plenipotentiary to suppose that if we got iato conflict with the Chinese on the question of entering Canton it would not be !unfavourably regarded at home. The manner in vwhich we have been dragged into war and the position of difficulty in which we have been placed are much to be deplornd. You have destroyed the whole of the suburbs of the town of Canton; you have destroyed the modern residences of the me&nts un to the river's edge ; you have destroyed several hue d yars of streets in the old town; that is to say, the busy places of commerce. All the factories have been destroyed. Right and left houses have perished, or been burnt up by incendiaries, pilaged by rebels, or bombard d in order that freer range may be given to our guns. I have spoken to some of those who have come from China since t as affair began, and they assure me that capitalists will desert Canton and that that town will never be able to recover its business. They have deserted Canton because they felt too insecure to carry on their business, and it is supposed that that feeling will be lasting. The general impression is that capital will depart from Canton, and receive employnment in other ports. You have therefore destroyed that very polt on which your commerce depended; and wlhat is to be your position for the future ? You have entered into a war vwhich cannot be defended. Sir J. Bowring did not teU Commissioner Yeh that this was not a legal ship ; but our debates are published to the world. Lord Lyndhurst is an authority in America and France as vell as here. (Cheers.) They will find everywhere that this quarrel is founded upon a triple illegahty, and that ve cannot in fact urge a single fact in defence of our conduct. We had a very good case before if you bad chosen to insist upon it, but the noble lord at the head of the Government gave up the claim at that time for admission into Canton. You might have said, " Fulfil the treaty of 1842, open the gates of Canton as you promised to do." But Lord C arendon says that this quarrel has nothing whatever to do with that. No, it was necessary that that ground should be abandoned because, bad as this case is, the present Government could rely upon no other defence than this about the Arrow, inasmuch as the question about entering would get up an old controversy to which other nations were not r?arties. They were therefore obliged to raise a quarrel in which they expected other nations would join. rut do you suppose that Frauce and America will jion in maki.ng common cause with you on the ground of this Arrowd?
speak advisedly when I say that I believe the American Government will not approve the course that has been taken. lbelievo they wiU not join in these violent proccedings. There are some people who know the French Government better than I do; but is it likely, when you have so bad, so vretched, and so dirty a case as this of the Arrow, that any one will take a share in it on your side ? (Hear, hear.) Is not this, thon, the proper time to declare that you do not approve these miserable proceedings, -which h-ve been carried on in your name unwarrantably by your subordinate representatives? But, may not this war, if it should go on, lead to complications with other Powers ? Way it not lead to complications with America? I see in these papers that the American merchants immediately protested against it. An American house at Canton has publicly protested that this war was commenced without any notice being dven to them, and that they will therefore hold England responsible for auy damage that may be done to their property. Well, what do you propose for the future? Part of tho wall of Canton was battered down in the expectation that the governor would yield. But he has not yielded, although you have bombarded the city itself and thrown shelis into it. What then do you propose to do? I see by the Indian papers that the Friend of India, which is always a great advocate of amnexation, tells Sir John Bowring to play the part of another Clive, and to enter upon a career of conquest, and to annex China as we have annexed India. Well, are you sure that the conqnest of China would be acquiesced in by other Powers? (sBear.) The United States of America are only half the distance from China that you are. They have a great Pacific as well as an Atlantio empire. I am not sure that America would acquiesce in your nmaking an India of China. Does anybody who knows anything about China believe that you could annex it ? It is an empire wi%h 300,000,C00 people. How are you to govern them? Nobody that has ever thought upon the subject would dream of your being able to do Eo. Then, what do you propose to do? I think that the wisest course which you could adopt would be to repudiate the acts of your representative, who has acted without authority and without instructions. That would be a statesmanlike and prudent course. (Hear, hear.) America and France would joinwithyon in making an aology to the Court of Pekin for this miserable affair of the Arrow. (Cheers.) But try, at the same time, to get those facilitics of internal intercourse in that 6reat country which yoar mercbants so much desire, and wilch your representatioii
will, in ell probability, enable you to obtain. America and France would lend you a joint influence in matingsuch representations, which you nover can hope to have while you are fighting on bebalf of this affair of the Arrow. But I have said enough with regard to my view upon the subject; I leave the matter in the haiids of the House. I hope we shall not hear it said in this House-as it has been in another pla^e-tbat these are barbarous people, and that you must deal with them by force. (Hear, hear.) I tell you that if you attempt to deal thus with them, it will be a difticult matter, and one, too, that will be costly to the reople of this country. (Hear, hear.) You wiU be disappointed, and deservedly so, if you rely upon the supposition that you wiU be able by violence to obtain your objects. (Hear.) And are these people so barbarous that we should attempt to coerce them by force into granting what we wish ? Here is an empire in which alone still subsist3 the ancient civilization of the world-one which, 2,700 yeams ago, according to some anthorities, had a system of primary education, which had its logic before the time of Aristotle, and its morals before that of Socrates. Here is a country which has had its uninterrupted treditions and histories for so long a period-that supphed silks and other articles of clothing to the IRomans 2,000 years ago ! They ale the very soul of commerce in the East, and the most populous empire in the world. They are the most industrious people in the East, and they are in fact called the ants of the East. You find them applyug themselves to different branches of industry with that assiduity and laboriousness which characoerize the Scotch and the Swiss. You find them not as barbarians at home. You find them engaged in all the arts and sciences, and thatthey excel in eversthing except in the art of war. You have here a people 'who have carried agriculture to a state of horticulture, and whose great cities rival in population those of the Western world. Now, there must be something in such a people deserving of respect. If we speak of them, we attempt to talk of themn as barbarians, and threaten tlieni with force because v:e say they are inaccessible to reason. But that must be because we do not understandthem; because their ways are not our ways, nor our ways theirs. (Hear, hear.) Now, is such a people as that not deserving of some sympathy, or at least of somo justice at the hands of the Legislature of England ? To the representatives of the people in this House I commend this question, with ful confidence that they wDiP do justice to that people. (Loud cheers.) The hon. gentleman then moved the following resolutions:-
"That this House hias heard with concern of the conflicts which have occurred between the British and Chinese authorities in the Canton river; and, without expressing an opinion as to the extenit to which the Government of China may have afforded tl.is country cause of complaint respecting the n,on-fulfilmeimt of the treaty of 1842, this House considers that the papers wbich have been laid upon the table fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resorted to at Canton in the late affair of the Arrow."
" That a select committee be appointed to inquire into the state of our commercial relations vwth China."
Mr. LABOUCHEl'E.-I am very far from regretting, stiUl less shall I venture to complain, that this subject has been broucght before the attention of tbe Hlouse by the
hon. gentleman wbo bas just resumed his Eeat. I think there is no member in this House, whatever judgment he may bave formed of theseltraTuections, who does not conenr with we in thinking that it would be unbecoming that they should take place without receiving the deliberate consideration of the House of Comnmons. They deeply concern most important commercial interests in this country. They affect still more deeply the reputation and credit of the British Empire. (Hear, hear.) I can assrve the House that I do not shrink from this diswussion, because I am persuaded that, when the caseis fairly and impartiaUy considered by this Hovse, it will come to the opinion that, however much any warfare of this description is to be regretted between parties whose strength is so unequal as that of England and China, yet that, under the circumstances in which we were placed, no blame can justly attach either to those ocal authorities who wore intrusted with the care of British Interests, or to him on whom tho immense weight of that 'eMaponbility reated, and who have a right to the just, or,
at aZl e;its, to the indulgent consideration of their country,men. I think that the Government could not have pur. sued any other course without betraying the interests that were intrusted to their care, and without lowering the British character in the eyes of the world, than of supporting those officials who had acted, as they thought, in a manner both jut and politio- I cannot treat so lightly as the hon. gentleman has a fact which is at once apparent upon the face of these papers, and which I think must have atruck every member who has read them. These tbings were not done in a corner. They were not done in some
violent armed seizure of men. Much an he depibred ths docnsequences, neither the House of Commons, the 2tiotln, nor the Govewmoent were responsible for them, Eant thiose who had committed tbese lawless, iladvise, and unjttsti. fiable acts. He was no advocatOefor dealing with OrlebLtal Powers upon different principles, where justice was concrnted from those adopted in dealing with Eumipean nations. Conscieine w at of no country and the laws of reorality and justioc were dt least as extensive as the world in which we lived. (Ehear.) Bat in the manner of dealmnwith an affront from Oriental nations there was a div
ferenme for it was known that their conduLet to those with whsom they were brought in contact. wrapootoe
to their ideas of their power of resistingl hopo rtioled sions s and thus, insults which a greats toenirhet pass over, if offerecl b) the oembrs of the Europead confederacy, antd l'ave f to bo dealt with by pula opinion, must, when offeredi by Oriental nations,b resented and punished on the spot. That was, he admitted no argumient for pushing matters to extremity. But the Chinese were offered twe opportunity of making a feU embeas of apology. Thdey were ready to return the 12 rmen (heaLr, hear), but they woiildnot return themr publicly, and in a manner that admitted they had offered dishonour to the British flag, and were hound to make reparation to it. The had dealt with us as hucksters and traders. They were wllinvg to give back what they had -taken, bTat they declined to redreo s our honour, and they had refiused to this day. He had eSdeak voured to argue this csel in a sprit of pure and calma
reason, divested of bheelihng a mattfr very diffcult where the honour of the Blriti.ih flag was concerned. It was perhaps not very philosophical that a flag, which was nothing more than a hit of painted linen should represent tho national honour and dignity, and he dared to say the aonciation of ideas rested on no profound or metaphysical feeling. If it were torn down by the Chinese and a, little soiled in the encounter it probably could ba wasHhed (murmurs), or the constituents of the hon. gentle. man the member for the West Riding could, he dared to say, turn us out a,new one. ("1 Oh, oh !") Yet, this very flag brave men had held to their breasts and glued to their best heart's blood rather than surrender it on the field of battle even to a gallant eneuy. This very flag at which hon, gentlemen sneered (cries ofn" Oh ") brave andhonourAble mnen hadl noaied to the moast,and had preferred to go down wrie it to the very depths of the ocean rathe than irber the Ignominy of hauling it down in the face of an erenemy. Anxd they did wisely and worthily, for these mere emblems of power, dignity, and honour, were themselves a power and an influence over the human mind, and in proportion as we guarded and respected them would they be guarded and respected by others. (Cheers.)
Mfr. WARREN ioved the adsiournument of the debate.
Mr. GIBhSONhadcbeenundcrthe imprettionthatthemotlot
of his hon. friend (Mr. Cobden) consisted of two separate resolutions. That was the intention of his hon. friend but he understoood the two resolutions had been hut bythe Speaker as one resolution. He held in his hand the original manuscript, handed in by his hon. friend when he gave notice of his motion. That fmanucript separated the motion into two resolutions, with the figures "I" and "12" prefixed to each paragraph, and was prefaced by the word REoi. tions, "in the plural nuiniber. Hehoetatison friend would be allowed to amend the misake mad in printing the resolutions, so that theyemightibeysubtitted to the House in 'the form intende byhshn red. (Hear, hear.)
The SPEAKER said that the paper clearly showed it to be intention of the hon. member for the West riding to Cesarate his resoiutions into two, but by thendmistake of the
tre they had been printed as one resolution, As he enot bo Chmaemayuhaved affd thein gentleman he had put them from ae chairs one resolution. If the Homse saw no objection the mnotion could be separated inito two resolutions, and the course to be taken wouldl thenr be for the House to allow the notion for the adjournment of the debate to be withdrawn, to permit the original resolution also to he withdrawn, and then to allow him to putt the first resolution, as intended by the hon. member. (Hear.)
Mr. COBDEN said, he was at a loss to know how the miistake had occurred, and thought that more care ought to be exercised in dealing with these tSS. He hoped the House would allow him to separate his motion into two resolut ions.
Lord PALMERSTON thought it was incumbent upon an hoen member to look at the votes, and see whether his mnotion was printed in the maniner in which he intended to propnos it. He should nut, however, offer any objection to the cang in the form of the hion, members resolution. (Blear, hear.)11

INCENDIARY FIRE NEAIt PONTEFRACr.-Seven grain and straw stacks, standing in a field on the Darrington-road, Fontefract, and the property of Messrs. Moxon, of that towrn, were found to ho on fire at about 6 o'clock on Sunday morning last, and, notwithstanding the most activo exertions to suppress the flames, the whole of the stack-s wrere consumed. From the faCt thatthe stacks were all butning simultaneously it is confidently believed that the fire was the vork of an incendiary.
FuNLERAL OF TlE LATE EARL OP ELLESMERE.- The funeral of this distinguished nobleman took place yes. terday, at Worsley. The ceremony was conducted withoub
mp or ostentation, the attendants compri ing only meoaMrs of the family, the tenants, &c., of the estate. No corporations or public bodies were present. The funeral cortege left Worsley-hall at 12 o'clock, the tenantry heading the procession, and including among them Ur. Robert Lansdale, of Booths-hall, Mr. John Cheetham, of Garratthall, and MIr. Harrison Blair. Then came the hearse, followed by the family as chief mourners, and in. cluding Captain Egerton, Mr. Egerton, and Captain A. Egerton, sons of the deceased nobleman
the Duke of Sutherland, brother; Mr. Byng, son-in-law; Marquis of Westminster, brother-in-law the Marquis of Stafford, nephew; Lord E. Howard, nepiew- Lord Grosvenor; Mr. Algermon Greville, brother-in-law - Mr H Gre ville, brother-in-law; the Earl of Cawder, Lord Enfield, Lord Robert Grosvenpr, and Lord Clanwilliam. There were also present,-Mr. George Loch, executor; Mr. Da Cane, solicitor; Dr. Kingsley, physician; Mr. Ramsbotham, private secretary; and Mr. Fereday Smith. The road from the park gates to the gates of the churchyard was fillcd on each aide by lines of colliers belonging to the estate, dressed in mourning; and the path through the churchyard from the gates to the entrance of the church and thence to the vault was lined by other employegs and dependants, of whom many thousands crowded the churchyard. The conduct of the vast multitude was most decorous, and in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion throughout. The funeral ceremony was at an end by about 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The present Earl of Ellesmere was prevented from attending by ilness.
VoTE BY BALLOT.-A meeting, attended bybbout 2,000 persons, at which Mr. George Wilson presided, was held in the Free-trado Hall, Manchester, on WVednesday evening. A Mr. Nicholson, who was introduced by the cbairman as the leader of the movement which resulted in the adoption of the ballot in the colony of Victoria, described the mode of votillg which he said was thero successfully in operation, and contended that TIe Tinws had not fairly s',,nmed up the abundant evidence Ss to the actual working of the system. The Hon. F. Berkeley, M.P., made a long address in favour of the ballot, commenting particularly upon the statements of Tlhe Timnin regard to the working of the ballot in America. The FTmce, he said, treated the matter of the baUot in a manner v,h;ch he thought utterly nwrorthy of the great talent of that great paper That paper said, "Oh ! but look at America; the ballot-boxc is not successful there, for there the ballot-boxc has been attacked." Nowr, of all the impudent assertions he could imagine, that was the mostimpudent asEertion to urge against the successof the balot. Why if the necessity of the ballot were not felt, it would not be attacked; but, he was sorry to say, its necessity was beginning to be felt more and more in America, consequently the
llot-box had its enemies, and was assailed with open force. A resolution was moved by Mr. A. Prentice
te gto support the objects of the Ballot yoit vsareed to. The chairman expressed his opinion that if the working classes woutld support the ballot, it muieht become lawv hefore the next general election.

ZON.DOI, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 27, 187.
Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock.
Lord CAMPBELL moved for a select committee to consider whether the privilege now enjoyed by reportz of proceedings of courts of jiustice may be safely extended to reports of proceedings of the two H{ouses of Parliament, and of other assemblies and public meetings.
Lord WENSLEYDALE briefly supported the motion, considering that the present anomalous state of the law on this most important question rendered inquiry into its principles necessary.
The adjourned debate on the Earl of D1RBY's motion was then resumed by
The Earl of CARNARRVON, who pointed out the' injustice committed by this country in enforcing the principles of international law when those laws applied in our own favour, and refusing to recognize them when their application justified the conduct of the Chinese. This had been the case in the question of allegiance. While this country claimed that no employment in a foreign country, no matter how long its duration, could weaken the allegiance of a British subject to his Sovereign, we expected to relieve Chinese shipping and their crews from the operation of their own laws by a mere letter of British registry. But, after all, this register, for -which so much was claimed in the case of the Arrow, was a mere imposture-it did not exist at the time. What, he would ask, under the same circumstances as in China, would be the course pursued by any of our Consuls at a French port ? If it had been similar, would this Government have supported such an officer ? On every principle of justice and humanity he begged their Lordships to disavow the acts committed at Canton, which were as much at -variance with the principles of Christianity as with those of either a sound or a safe policy.
After a few observations from Lord vanTHuEN,
Lord Sr. Lo&NARD's reviewed generally the operation of the Supplementary Treaty of 1843. The Merchant Shipping Act, it was contended by the Government, legalized the provisions of the colonial ordinance; but, in truth, the latter law was in force some time before the Merchant Shipping Act was passed. It was suipposed that the ordinance gave to anypersons who took a certificate of registry aU the powers and privileges which pertained to British ships. But this was to claim for the colonial ordinance a power to alter the established laws of EBgland, and he, as a constitutional lawyer, would say that for such purpose it was of no more value than -waste paper. He contended that the ordinance never claimed to give the privileges of British ships, but merely the right of trading backwards and for'wards between Hongkong and China; so that that law of which they had heard so much was in reality beside the question. He reviewed the arguments used by Lord CLARENDON in support of the Government, and showed that from that Minister's speech the certificate was admitted to be no British register after all, so that we were actually forcing a cruel war on an inoffensive nation on behalf of a socalled British ship without a British register. He thought the law laid down by the LORD CHANCELLoR, when he spoke on the same question, -was equaUy wrong, and, in fact, at entire variance -with the admitted law of nations. He contrasted the conduct of the Government towards the Chinese and that which they had pursued towards Russia. Every military consideration called for the destruction of Odessa; every sentiment of humanity and justice appealed to them to spare Canton. He did not consider the motion made as a party question, but really whether the country was prepared to continue and press forward a war unjustly and unwisely entered on.
The LORD CHANCELLOR briefly denied that in the course of the debate he had advanced anything contrary to the law of nations or calculated to mislead the members of theirLordships' House upon the legal bearings of the question at issue between the Government and the authorities at Canton.
Lord WENSEYDvnLE thought that all members of their Lordships' House would concur with the first part of the motion, which regretted the termination of our amicable relations with the Chinese. With reference to the latter paragraph, that hostilities should not have been undertaken without express instructions received from HER MKiJEsTY's Government, he could not at all agree. The distance was too remote to permit a course so dilatory at such a crisis. The authorities at Canton had violated not only the existing treaties with this country, but the commonest safeguards of international law, and had drawn down upon themselves a punishment which was not only merited but necessary. He considered that the colonial ordinance was perfectly legal, though, even if its legality could not le established in a court of justice, the Chinese at least had no right to dispute its validity, by capturing an English vessel and insulting the English flag.
The Earl of MALImEsnRy thought the question was one both of policy and morality. Sir J. BowRINi actuaUy admitted the vessel had no right to the British protection or the British flag. That flaw in the indictment, if he might so term it, Sir JonN BoW-iNo had, however, concealed not only from the Chinese, but, as he (Lord MALMESBURY) believed, from Sir MICIIAEL SEYMOUR, for that officer had spoken of bombarding the town in consequence of the Chinese refusing to make reparation for this insult to the English flag. Could he, as an officer and a gentlemwan, iiave so written if he was aware of the fact that the Arrow had no right to carry the British flag, and had no claim on the British protection? He confessed he was by no means satisfied with the explanations given by Lord WENSLEYDALE as to the legality of their proqeedings; but, admitting all his arguments,
and grantlpg that the lorcha was British from stem! to stern, it'was still no excuse for the horrible pro- i ceedings which had been adopted at Canton. He admitted the importance of partyties and the beneficial iinQuence which they exercised over Parliamentary government, but there were questions of conscience which were above all party considerations. This was one, and he trusted that their lordships would
decide for the cause of truth and justice, and 81up- I port the motion of Lord DBRvY.
The EAl of LBLmii, explained the pecuaar|
difference between lorchas and junks, with the Chinese maritime laws relating to each, for the purpose of showing that Commissioner YBE must have been aware of those laws, and have acted in defiance of them, well knowing that the Arrow was British. Our claim for admisrsion to Canton was both just and reasonable, and absolutely necessary to regulate the interests of the extensive commercial relations between the countries. But at the same time he was by no means in favour of the suggestion for a resident Envoy at Pekin, and he hoped Hym MAAJEsTY's Ministers would not for an instant entertain such an idea. All attempts to establishregular diplomatic relations with the Chinese had signally failed, with more or less of ignominy, both with the Portuguese, the Dutch, and ourselves. He trusted that the Government would give a distinct denial to the report which stated thatthey were about to renew their efforts, and s.end an Envoy to Pekin.
The Earl of ELLENBORO-UGH thought, in the present instance, the conduct of this country towards the Chinese was unjustifiable. He firmly believed that the insult to our flag, such as it was, was not intended; and, if their lordships believed that such was, the case, did they not feel that a light offence had been heavily atoned ? The Chinese people had been alienated, their forts overturned, fire and sword carried into the bosom of a peaceful city. Was not that enough to satisfy the offended dignity of this country, to appease even Dr. BOWBING ? On Dr. Bowinrr a fearful responsibility rested; that responsibility was now accepted by the Government; but he entreated their Lordships' House not to share it. There would be no peace for China while Dr. BowRDeG remained near Canton, and he onght to be recalled, were it only for his having stated with regard to the Arrow that which when he stated it he believed to be untrue. The losses which would result to this country and India from this war of Dr. BowaRiN's it was almost impossible to estimate. Already a penny of the Income-tax was gone in the falling off of the duty on tea, and the deficiency would not stop at that. All our influence in China would be overturned-our efforts towards the conversion of the people entirely neutralized. How, indeed, could we attempt to teach them a religion of benevolence and humanity when our Minister was breaking the contmandments-committing murder in an unjust war-not telling the truth of his neighbour, and gratifying his covetousness at the expense of the sufferings of mankind? He hoped the decision of their Lordships' House would protect them from an act like this, an act which was at once a folly and a crime.
.nari .*vRmTLz earnestly deprecated the tone adopted by the last speaker as most unjust to a useful public servant, and unworthy the dignity of a grave and most serious discussiou. His lordship then proceeded to review the whole question of the seizure of the Arrow, with the circumstances attending it, showing that the English flag was flying at the time she was taken and was hauled down by the Chinese, and illustrating by many instanes the impossibility of depending upon the truth of a single circumstance in the version put forth by the authorities at Canton. The very able argument of his noble and learned friend Lord WNNSLEYDALE had shown the legality of the certificate of registry in the most conclusive manner. The conduct of Sir Jonx Bow=rG had been guided throughout by the strict law of the colonial ordinance and the supplementary treaty of 1843. Had he acted otherwise, or by other rules, what would then have been said ? Would not the Governrment have been chargedwithfollowing the principlesof the Manchester school, and preferring the paltry interests of comaerce to the honour of the British flag ? He most utterly denied the assertion made that night that Sir Jon? BowRnuG received practical reparation when the 12 men were sent back to him. In fact, the whole of Sir JoHN BoWRING's proceedings were said to have been actuated by his monomania to be received in Canton as English Minister, though those who urged that charge quite forgoIkthat it was the motive which had actuated most of our public servants acquainted with the East,and even his noble friend Earl GRaY, when Colonial Secretary in 1845. But would anything have been said against the promptitude of Sir Joum BowRiNG if, instead of the 12 Chinese taken out of the lorcha, there had been one Englishman ? Would he have been justified in waiting four months for the return of his messenger with instructions from the home Government before he interfered to save such an Englishman from assassination? His lordship then proceeded to remark on the zeal with which noble lords on the opposite side of the House constituted themselves lay readers to the episcopal bench, and admonished right rev, prelates with moving sermons, whenever they were in doubt about w hich way their votes should go. He need notbremark on the disinterested advice thus offered them, and he was sure that the Bishops would vote according to the true dictates of their consciences, and be guided only by what they believed and felt to be the principles of justice and Christianity. If the object of the Opposition was to censure HER MAJESTy'S Government, let them do so in an intelligible manner, and not cast blame on the exertions of those ptublic servants who were totally undeserving such treatment at their lordships' hands.
The Bishop of OXFORD believed that the claim which we made in behalf of the lorcha was not founded either on the principles of law or justice, and therefore the war which had sprung from that claim was indefensible, and its principle untenable among Christian men. He condemned the conduct of Sir JoHmN BowimIn- in the strongest terms, and reprobated the conduct of a great Christian nation like England, spreading the horrors of war among a weak and unoffending people. He entreated the House to pause ere it gave the weight of its great authority to support an act so unjust and wrong as this. If they did so let them recollect that they were going against a PowvBR which took its own time for vindicating eternal justice, and which never allowed a wrong to pass unavenged, and a POwER which could find, if need were, in the very weakness of China sufficient elements to abase and rebuke the lawless oppression of this country.

Mr. GLADSTONE announced his intention of making his motion on the subject of the tea duties, not, as he originally intended, on the question of the SPEAKER leaving the chair, but in the Committee of Ways and Means this day.
Sir D. NORREYS moved for leave to bring in a Bill for the better administration of the fiscal affairs of counties in Ireland.
The motion was opposed by Mr. HEIr
Leave was, however, given to introduce the Bill. Mr. CoBDEr moved the following resolution:-
' That this House has heard with concern of the confliets which have occurred between the British 'nd Chinese authorities in the Canton river; and, without expressing an opinion as to the extent to which the Government of Ohina
may have afforded this country cause of complaint respecting the non-fulliment of the Treaty of 1842, this House coneiders that the papers which have been laid upon the table fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resorted to at Canton in the late affair of the Arrow * and that a select committee be appointed to inquire into the state of our commercial relations with China."
Adverting to the extent to which the national conscience, he said, had been moved upon this question, and the large amoumt of sympathy felt with reference to the object of his motion, and premising that he had no motive but ts arrive at a just decision, Mr. COBDEN commenced with a brief narrative of the facts consequent upon the boarding of the lorcha Arrow, on the 8th of October, up to the date of the last advices; and asked the House to inquire how all this devastation and warfare began, and who were the authors, and he asked it, he said, in defence of our own honour, and as if we had been dealing with a strong Power, and not a weak one. He contrasted the conduet of the British authorities at
ongrkong with that which would have been puraued, he said, had the Government we dealt with been at Washington an* the transaction had taken place at Charleston. He cited the opinion expressed by Lord LrDnNuHrT, that, upon the principles of international law the Chinese Governor was xight with reference to the Arrow, which was in no respect a British vessel; and he urged, besides, other reasons why the whole proceeding *ax illegAl oDU our pd. Admitting this,
-and he defied contradiction upon this point,look, he said, at the correspondence between Consul PARnrs, a young man, and Yms, the Governor of a province ! There was not the slightest indication on the part of the latter to insult our authorities; on the contrary, while courtesy, forbearance, and temper appeared on his side, arrogance and presumption were manifest on the other. In short, Mr. PksiKss seemed to have made up his mind not to be satisfied in spite of the logical arguments of Governor YEE, whose exposition of the law upon the question he considered worthy of Westminster-hall. Heconscientiously believed, he said, that there had been a preconceived design to pick a quarrel with the Chinese, for which the whole world would cry shame upon us. Thepapers recently laid before the House Ir. COBDsN treated contemptuously, as a garbled record of trumpery complaints against the Chinese. It was an insult, he maid, to bring down such a book in order to make out a case for Lord CLABENDON. On the other hand, he read letters, some of them from Sir JOHN DAvis, testifying to the civility and inoffensive habits of the Chinese, and to the overbearing conduct of our own countrymen in China, with whom Sir JonN said he found it more difficult to deal than with the Chinese; and Mr. COBDEN suggested reasons why this was likely to be the case,-that Englishmen carried with them a haughty demeanour and an inflexible bearing towards the natives of other countries. Ile strongly condemned the vast pretensions put forth by mercantile men in England, who demanded concessions from China in terms which he characterized as downright selfsh violence. As to the admission of foreigners into Canton, he was of opinion that in the Treaty of 1842 itwvras contemplated that foreigners should have free access to Canton; butit would be found from the despatches of Sir CEsonn Bowxnxr and Lord PALMERSTON that there were the best possible grounds for not persevering in this demand, the Cantonese being fierce, ungovernable, and hostile to Englishmen. This was, in his opinion, a chimera; it was an object not worth fighting for; he believed if this part of the treaty could be enforced to-morrow it wrould be of no use to us. In the last place, Mr. COBDEN contended that Sir JoHx BOWnReN had not only violated the principles of international law, but had acted contrary to his instructions, and even to express directions from hisGovernment, and that this dirty squabble might lead to complications with other nations.
Mr. LABOUIJEEBB said, he did not complain of this subject having been brought before the House, since the question affected the reputation of the British nation. When the case was fairly and impartiaUy considered, he was persuaded that the House would be of opinion that no blame justly attached to our local authorities at Canton, or to the Government at home, who could have pursued no other course than they had taken without betraying the interests intrusted to their care and lowering the British character in the eyes of the world. There was one fact of importance, he observed, on the face of the papers-namely, that these transactions had taken place, not in an obscure corner of the world, but before the great community of merchants, who, he affirmed, had been ibelled by the language employed towards them by Mr. COBDEN. TheFrenchandAmericanmerchantshad coincided with ours in their view of the conduct of theChinese authorities, and Mr. ILBOUCHERE read a letter from the United States' Chief Superintendent of Trade, condemning the character and proceedings of the Canton authorities. He believed, he added, that for some time past the relations of the Chinese authorities at Canton with every European Government had become so thorougbly unsatisfactory as to beat leDg,thabsolutelyintolerable, andthatthe general opinion was that, at the price of a temporary interruption of commercial transactions, the Canton authorities should be restrained from setting aside treaty obligations and committing acts of violence. After criticizing the form and terms of the motion, Mr. LA3oucunRE insisted upon the British character of the lorcha, and that, when the outrage was committed, the Governor YEH knew he was doing wrong. He denied tbat the British functionaries had evinced any want of forbearance, and that Consul PARKES had, as Mr. COBDES alleged, endeavoured to pick a quarrel with the Chinese; his proceedings, on the contrary, had, he said, been gentle and moderate. As to the right of entry into Canton, this had been conceded by treaty, and, although it had been postponed from time to time, it had never been abandoned by the British Government, and he was not satisfied that it was an improper step onthepart of Sir JOHN BOWRIhnG under the circumstances, to take this opportunity to press this stipulation. Mr. CoBn~ had said that Sir JoaN had acted in violation of the express directions of Lord GREY to avoid any act of hostility against the local Government without authority from home; but he (Mr. LABOUCUBERE) was of opinion that Sir JOHN BOwRiNG had not rendered himself liable to this imputation, and he read a dictum of Lord SZOWELL, that a commander sent to a distant State carried with him such a portion of sovereign authority as was necessary to the exigencies of the service on which he was employed. On the part of the Government at home he should regret, he said, if it had been so weak and pusillanimous as to fail in supporting officials placed in a difficult position, whose conduct had been applauded by the representatives of foreign nations. We were not, he observed, at war with the Court of Pekin, but with the local Government at Canton, and he hoped that the result of these hostilities would be to place the relations of Europe with China upon a safer and more satisfactory footing.
Sir B. LvTTON did not think that Mr. LABouCHaRE had succeeded in giving a very satisfactory reply to the powerful arguments of Mr. CoBDEN, and he undertook to show how groundless was the position assumed by Mr. LABOUCHERE. For this purpose, he entered upon an argument of some length to show that, by the international law, since the treaty of Nankin the regulations of the Government of Hollgkong could not confer upon the lorcha a British character ; but, assuming that it possessed such character, he contended that our officials were not justified in theirproceedings. The language used by Consul PARKEs in his correspondence with Commissioner YEE he censured as repugnant to the rules of diplomatic intercourse and offensive, and he condemned with vehemence the hostilities carried on by our commanders upon the miserable plea of an alleged affront to our flag, for the refusal of an entry into Canton was not a tenable ground, it being a question whether the Emperor of CHrnA himself could practically enforce that article of the treaty, or, if he could, whether the effect would not be pernicious. He charged'the Ministers with an improper exercise of the authority of the CBOWN in this matter, for it was the duty of a wise Government to correct the over- zeal of its agents.
Mr. I,. DAVIES opposed the motion, which was nominally for a committee to inquire into our commercial relations with China, but really it went, he said, to assail the whole of our movements in the war, to paralyze our efforts, and to encourage the enemy.
Sir J. RAMNSDEN observed, that the three points in this question put by Sir B. LyrTToN were short and clear, and must be decided by the evidence ;-first, was the Arrow a legally registered British vessel, owned by a British subject, and entitled to British
seconcuy,. wa th barig f h
poecvtbion; seconuly,- was the boarding of the Arrow and the forcible abstraction of part of her crew a violation of the treaty; and, thirdly, were the proceedings of the British Consul in demanding
an apology and reparation, and, when denied, adopting strong measures, justifiable imder the cir-
cumstances ? Reasoning upon the facts, he resolved the first two questions in the affirmative without hesitation; and, with regard to the last, although he deplored the violent mieasures resorted to, and the destruction of life and property, he found no evidence of a single hasty or ill-considered act or of one angry expression on the part of the British officials. On the other hand, he read an atrocious proclamation, supposed to have emanated from the Governor of Canton himself, and he asked Mr. COBDEN whether such a document would have proceeded from an American functionary
Sir T. HERaBERT spoke in support of the motion, expressing his regret at the resort to extreme measures without the previous sanction of the home Government.
Sir E. PZRny likewise supported the motion. The motion, he observed, raised two questions,-whether the British authorities were right in their demand upon the Chinese, and, if they had right on their
side, whether they were justified in resorting to extrememeasures? Applyingprinciples of law to t.he
facts, he argued that the ow never uld claim the rights of a British vessel; but, assuming that he was wrong in his law, he maintained that the hostilities were not justifiable, and he took a view simi-
lar to hr. COBDEN of the character of the European rmervantile community of Cantorn, whoX nWrvteK5 in
provoking a breach with the local authorities rendered them, he taid, unsafe guides.
Mfr. GREOSON complained that Sir E. P£Bny had scandalized the mercantile community of Canton, who, he said, were as much addicted to peace as Mr. COBD]N could be. -It had been fully understood, he observed, by Chinese and Europeans, that the Arrow carried a British flag. This, however, was only a continuation of insults which had been heaped upon us by the Chinese authorities for a series of years. He read a letter from British merchants long resident at Canton testifying to this fact, and approving the measures adopted by the British authorities.
Lord J. Russzr said he had every disposition to pay respect to the opinions and wishes of the British merchants at Canton; at the same time, the House must not forget that it became them seriously to contemplate what had taken place, and to decide the question according to their opinion of the rights, the interests, and the honour of the country. With this view he had listened with great attention and anxiety to the statement of Mr. LA:souonEm, hoping that the ambiguity which seemed to rest upon the policy of the Government might be dispelled, and some view might be afforded of a distinct policy to which Parliauent might look for future security. In all these respects the speech of Mr. L&BoucHEsin had disappointed him. The question he consideredunder these three heads-first, the nationality of the Arrow; second, the right to enterCanton; third, the policy which theGovernment intended to pursue, and the object at which they aimed in hostilities. Neither of the two provocations, he contended, afforded a sufficient ground for the extreme measures resorted to, which were not a proper mode of settling such a great question; and he thought HBR MAESTy'S Government ought to have considered that the British officials had committed a serious offence, having, without sufficient cause, put in jeopardy amicable relations with a great and populous empire, and proceeded to the solution of a question which a Secretary of State had expressly declared should not be decided without reference to the Government at home. And where was the affair to end? He feared that, in the disorganized state of China, a social revolution might be produced, and it might cease to be a country in which commercial operations could be advantageously carried on. The worst part of the case was that Sir JoRN, BOWRING, while he declared that the vessel had lost all right to British protection, set up that claim against the Chinese Cornmissioner, and required an apology to the British flag, as having been rightfilly used. Much had been said about the prestige of this country, but he had no wish to see its prestige maintained separated from character, honour, and reputation.
Mr. Lows observed that the argument that we could not by any municipal law give a right to Chinese subjects against their own Government proved too much, for the result would be that the greater portion of the British ships would not be within the treaty. He contended that the ordinance under which the lorcha was registered was legal in its inception; and as to the question whether the Chinese had violated the treaty, what an outcry would have been raised, he said, if the BritishConsul had, upon apaltry quibble, repudiated the British character of the vessel ! The real question, he contended, was not one of legality but of the anvimus of the Chinese authorities, and it was impossible to acquit them of a bad animus in the matter. Much as he deplored the consequences, it appeared to him that upon those authorities, not upon the British Government or its officials, rested the responsibility.
On the motion that the debate be adjourned,
Mlr. GrmoSx stated that it had been the intention of Mr. COBDEN to submit his motion in two distinct resolutions, but, through some mistake, its form had been altered, and it had been put as one resolution.
After some discussion, the motion was altered to its original form, and the first part of the motion was moved as one of the resolutions.
The debate was then adjourned until this day.
After some further business, the House adjourned at 20 minutes past 12 o'clock.
The Chinese controversy now raging in both
The Chinese controversy now raging in both Houses exhibits a fact in morals which is only not painful because it is not new. Aks each man rises to speak, whatever the subtlety of his reasoning, the depth of his sentiments, his humanity or his acquaintance with law, he has uniformly arrived at a conclusion in harmony witlh his political convictions. This, of course, would be natural and intelligible if the matter in dispute were aWhig act or a Tory act; if it sprang out of a certain policy, and had, therefore, some actual relation with our politics at home. In this case, however, a man who has long had no other character than that of a Colonial Governor has been involved in difficulties that have no connexion or relation whatever with home politics, and has taken a course entirely out of his own head, without either advice from his superiors at home or any reference to their politics. It is simply the case of a Roman Proconsul having his own quarrel with the Arabians or Parthians, and taking his own measures accordingly. WVhat Sir Jou.N BOWRING has suffered and done is equally a surprise to both parties, and they hear of it both at the sanie tinme. Yet it is enough that HER AAJESTY'S Ministers are constitutionally resporsible for his actions; so the Ministerialists defend him, to a man; the Opposition are equally ready to condemn him on every principle of justice, humanity, and law, and on the fullest consideration of all the circumstances of the case. Nor are these only unskilled laymen who are so ready to cut the knot of law. The lawyers themselves, the oldest, the wisest, and the best, are not less fortunate than the rest in the concurrence of their judicial and political convictions. There are, indeed, certain members of both Houses occupying independent positions; but, notwithstanding their vaunted neutrality, there was nobody who did not know beforehand what Lord GnnY, or Alr. COmDmn, or Lord JonN- RiusSELL, or the Bishop of OXFOIiD, or any other liberal unattached, would have to say on the subject. Their speeches could have been made for them by almost anybody who chose to indulge in that exercise of ingenuity. What are we to conclude from a spectacle in which conscience is apparently so subordinate to political bias, and in which law itself is the obsequious servant of party ? We may conclude, at aU events, that the question is hardly one for Senates. It is an affair of the Executive. If we choose to have colonies and stations all over the world, we must send out Governors 'with vast responsibility and powers. What we have to do is to send out the best men we can find, and give them the best instructions in our power. But when we have done this we must be prepared to stand by them, unless the case is very clear indeed against them. No other course is possible. None other is compatible with our position, or with the safety of our public servants all over theglobe. They ought to be very careful what they do, but they ought to be supported; and the very fact that in this case a public officer is supported by all on one political side at home and condemned by all on the other side only proves what an utter farce it wouild be to attempt a revision of every act done by our representatives 10,000 or 15,00O miles off, and to keep them always waiting for orders from home. Ashappenedbefore in 1840, 1841, were the present occupants of the Treasury Bench and the Opposition suddenly to change places on some unexpected question of home politics the latter would' take the earliest opportunity of declaring that, whatever their opinion as to the origin of the quarrel, they saw no choice but to proceed by force of arms, with a view to a raore satisfactory position than we had before; and, in the probable event of success, they would be quite as ready to extort hard terms and dollars frbm the "inoffensive" Chinese.
Vir. COBDES political independence betrays its true character by going rather too far. He avows himself independent not only of party, but even of 1AiOnal sympathies; for we never read a speech
more directly aimed at the destruction of our national character. Of course, he gives up his long-attached and long-respected friend Sir JonN BowxNroIG; he also gives up all our merchants, not only at Canton, but at Genoa, Leghorn, Trieste, Smyrna, Constantinople, and even our own Liverpool. He admits againsb the general conduct of our offlcials at Hongkong the testimony of an American official, recommending it, however, to our credence by the concession that the witness wishes us every sucCeSS; he enlarges on the smuggling at which our officials not only connive, but which they assist by their colonial regulations, and proclaims the baneful character of our corn-
merce. On these grounds he justifies, and there- I fore admits, the antipathies of the Chinese population, the jealousy of their Governors, and the systematic violation of the Treaty of 1842. On every point he puts us all in the wrong, down to the comparative styles of the English and Chinese officers in the published correspondence. But what is the least justifiable part of Mr. CO0D2N'S speech is the attempt to show that England habitually acts the coward as well as the bully, that she has one policy for the weak and another for the strong, and that under similar circumstances she would pursue very different courses with the Americans, for example, and the Chinese. Indeed, the whole of the speech is a consistent and universal depreciation of the British character and proceedings, not only at Canton, but everywhere else on the face of the globe; depreciation not only of Governments, or of governing classes, but of British merchants, British silors, British apprentices, and the whole British people at home, who swallow such things, interspersed with warnings of trade already lost by our misconduct, and likely to be extinguished altogether.
Now, we beg to say that this is proving too much. The British people do not pretend to any great sanctity or nicety of conscience, but when anybody sets up as Devirs advocate against them they know how to defend themselves. Let us just consider what MIr. COBDEN admits by the reaction of these charges, and incidentally in the course of his speech. He admits a hostile feeling and a jealous policy on the part of the people and Governors of Canton. He admits on their part a systematic violation of a solemn treaty. He admits very great inconvenience and annoyance patiently suffered for many years by our people and the other Europeans. He admits a community of feeling between us and the other Europeans, as weUl as the Americans, who, of course, " don't allow such doings as we do," not having so much salt or opium to dispose of. He admits that through the il-feeling and jealousy of the Chinese the exportation of British manufactures into that country has not increased since 1842, the inevitable result being that for want of a good trade a bad trade bas thriven-opium for clothing, and smuggliug for open traffic. His own argument, meant to inculpate aU our authorities, proves that the use of the British flag, the facility with which it maybe obtained, the frivolous pretences on which it is granted, the irregularity of its use, up or down, as it may serve the occasion, the indignation and perplexity of the Chinese, everything down to the last act-the violent boarding of the lorcha, and the seizure of the men out of her, in defiance of the British character, then on the spot claimed for the vessel-all result, by a chain of necessary and obvious causation, from the continual violation of the Treaty of 1842.
We need not go beyond Mr. CoBDNn's own speech for the worst possible construction of the act of seizure, or for the propriety of founding upon it a demand for the observance of the Treaty. All this tells, too, with not less force on that other very serious calumny, of our truculence to the wealk and cowardice, or at least prudence, to the strong. Certainly there is no nation on the earth,-not the Russians, 3Ir. COBDEZ must admit,-not even the Americans, Mr. COBDEN must also admit,-from whom we should tolerate for fifteen years the utter and contumelious disregard of aTreaty obtainedwith great effort and cost. We believe that this disregard is even more flagitious than appears on the face of the correspondence. We believe that the hostility of the population of Canton is not the real and original cause. It answers the purpose of the Governor of Canton and a host of officials to exclude foreigners from the city, and compel even all the tea and other exports to pass out at one gate, as otherwise they apprehend they will not be able to levy that irregular toll which they exact for their own personal benefit in addition to the Imperial, provincial, and transit duties. It is they who keep up this feeling by all sorts of appeals, by calumnies against strangers, and by the rankest of Oriental cant. They then turn rolnd and represent to the EMPEROn that, in consequence of the unfortunate prejudices of the populace of Canton, they cannot carry out the treaty His MAEssrY has sworn to maintain. The next step is to come to us with the excuse that the EMPEROR is obliged to give way to the popular feeling. Finally, they wish to charge on us all the inevitable consequences of an exclusion as disgraceful to them as it is contrary to the interests and rights of mankind. Such are the people, such the artifices, and such the cause which have found an advocate in Mr. CoBDENx, to the prejudice of British moderation, humanity, and justice.
While MIr. COBDEN in the House of Commons was referring the whole question to the national vices of our countrymen, and the defensive feelings excited in the helpless and simple Cbinese, the legal view of the case was that selected for the hereditary branch of the Legislature. Lord Sr. LEONARD'S, as adventurous in his line as the member for the West Riding in his, took a view of our colonial law which would have placed the whole of our trade, and conseqnently our treaty rights with China, at the mercy of the authorities in the city of Canton. According to his Lordship, it is wholly superfluous to inquire into the registration of the Arrow, as the register, were it ever so unquestioned, would have given the vessel no protection against any amount of violence on the part of the Chinese authorities. Now, as the peculiar relations which those authorities choose to maintain with us render it impossible for us to have a sufficient body of British subjects and British craft in those waters, and the conimu-
nication must therefore be kept up by means of the natives, it is evident they will be liable to every ouLrage, and our trade to any intorruption or extortion, unless colonial registers be in force as regardsthe Chinese as well as ourselves. No doubt, a state of absolute exclusion, and an immense trade carried on in the face of it, are a very extraordinary state of things ; and the colonial ordinances for the conduct of our trade under such circumstances are likely to have a peculiar character. But it is rather too late to inform the British Parliament, after the system has been in force for several years, that it. is all contrary to law. WVe beheve that the authority of our Colonial Executive is worth more than this. The House of Lords, happily, did not take this view of the question, and has resolved by a considerable majority to maintain the flag of Eng-
land against Governor YEE and the populace of Canton.
We are bold enough to think that few subjects
We are bold enough to think that few subjects can concern the public at large more intimately than that which Lord C&,,uPnELL mooted last night with direct reference to the press, and we are rejoiced to see that he had the support of Lord WlNSmDALE. The interests at stake are certainly not those of journalism
alone, but those of society. It has been recently declared as the law of the land that if a reporter makles a bon4fide report of the proceedings at a public meeting, and this report is published in i due course, the publication, supposing it to contain
slanderous words spoken at the said meeting byA B against C D, gives C D the right of an action, not against A B, the author of the slander, but against the journal in which the speech is reported, although no plea of malice may be set up. We have already expressed our doubts whether this decision was so absolutely and manifestly in accordance with the old common law of England as to deserve an immediate and unhesitrting delivery, but we now omit this point of the question, and address ourselves to that element of common reason which is taken to be the basis and. essence of law itself.
Under certain conditions we can understand. both a charge and a penalty attaching not only to, the aathor of slander, but to the person or personswho gave that slander a currency which it would not otherwise have obtained, and rendered it, therefore, proportionately more injturious to its object. The distinction drawn between spoken and written words appears to have had its originL in some such assumptions as those to which weare alluding. The great element of slander is publi*ity. We express the unbounded liberty of purely private opinion by the common proverb that " thoughts are free." We enlarge the limits of this freedom a little by allowing latitude to private conversation, as also to communications professedly private between one person and another; and, as no such interchange of ideas. could attain the publicity which follows upon cir. culation in print, it may have been argued that the person who gave this publicity to the matterin other words, the publisher-was answerablefor more of the damage occasioned than the author himself. Some such idea as this was im-- pressed, we presume, on Lord CAPBBLI.'s mind, when, on introducing the subject to the notice of the Lords a few days since, he observed, " It has. " been said that the person calumniated may bring "an action against the man who makes the speech ; C but it must be remembered that a speech spoken "is a smaller offence than one that is published " and sent all over the world."
We now proceed to show how entirely reconcileable is this view of the case with that which would exempt the press from the liability attaching to it, and in support of our proposition we will appeal, not to our own interests, but to those of all parties alike. In a few words, we admit that publicity constitutes the gravamen of slander, but we affirm that the publication in question should be charged to the man who knowingly utters such slander at a public mneetinq7, and not to the journal which mechanicaUy, without feeling, and in the course of its duty, reports the proceedings. Doubt-. less, the system of reporting adds to the publicity of opinions so delivered, but that is simply an incident of the times in which we live, and, unless. it is itself injurious, cannot be more accountable for the results than any other of the agencies, such as steam, railvays, and so forth, by which the circulation of opinion is facilitated. We maintain that when a man rises to speak at a public meeting he does so with all the obligations of the position, including that of being reported. He knows and should feel that his words will be taken down, and that, if the subject or the speaker be of sufficient importance, they wil come in a few hours to the knowledge of millions. We say that a speaker in public, umder these conditions, is himself the publisher of his speech. He is the author not only of the slander, if slander it contains, but of the publicity too. He took all the steps required for its publication when he uttered it knowingly within reach of an echo which would repeat his words a thousand times. The newspaper represents nothing but the rock from which the voice reverberates, nothing but the substance on which the photograph is taken. All the consequences attach to the speech alone. Jf there is a difference between spoken and written words, it prevails equallybetween words spoken in private and spoken in public. When they are spokenin publiethe speaker speaks them and writes them too. He speaks, as it were, through a speaking tube, which,
as he well knows, will and must carry his words. over the whole face of the country. Whatever novelty or aggravation of character may be imparted to speech by these results is imparted by the spealer himself when he deliberately resorts to a public meeting for the delivery of his opinions.
'WiU anybody urge that this system of publication and reporting is undesirable in itself, and slhould therefore be deprived of protection?? We think not. The gentlemen with whom we have had the greatest differences about the functions of the press are precisely those who uphold this one function above every other. We recollect when Mr. COBDEN seemed disposed to limit the duties of newspapers to reporting public speeches, and, if there is one point in which the instrumentality of the press is more prized than another, it is that by which every public speaker is enabled to address not only his own audience, but his countiymen at large. We cannot, indeed, pretend to doubt the opinions of the country in this respect, and we ask therefore, with entire confidence in the justice of our claim, for simple protection in the discharge of a public and a serviceable duty. As it is, the responsibility is shifted from those who should bear it to those who are in no way chargeable with it-who have no malice, and no intent, indeed, of any kind, except that of professional accuracy. In reality, it is quite impossible for us, even if it were so unreasonable as to demand it, that we should supply that caution which speakers ought to exercise themselves. With reports from aU quarters and on all subjects pouring in upon us; with sometimes a total absence of information about the parties or politics locally concerned, and with a few hours only in which to reduco aU these materials to order, it is out of the question, if we are to be responsible for anything said by anybody, that we could steer clear of offence; in fact, if the law is held to be as it is, and advantage were commonly taken of it, newspapers would be compelled to give up reporting altogether.
We hold to thi3 one proposition-that the publiciiy of the meeting and the bonu fidc character of the report should decide the whole case. If the meeting were not a public meeting, or not such an one as would be reasonably thought open to the publication of its proceedings, then there would be good ground for argument against any journal which, by publishing such proceedings out of the common course of its duty, had given extraordinary currency and effect to any slander which might have been uttered. If, again, the report could in any way be convicted of malice in the prominence, colour, form, or any other attribute given to the words of the speaker, an action might fairly lie against it; but these are precisely the points for a jury to consider. We do not ask to be relieved of fair responsibility. We ask only that in the diecharge of a duty which the country expects at ouir hands, and which is admitted to be a great public benefit, we should be protected against charges which pro-
perly appertain to others. This would be justice to the press; as justice to the press it would be an advantage to the public; and if, as regards speakers at public meetings, it should impose upon them the obligation of a little more care, we do not think anybody woould be found to regret the reslt,

I believe that Colonel Ouseley has not yet left Paris, but his dep)arture is said to be fixed for this evening or to-morrow. On the Persian question I can only add that, as I am informed, the articles of the proposed comvention with England specify that
the latter Power shall henceforth be treated as thel most favoured nation, that is, as Russia, with respect to commercial advantages; and, moreover, that she shall have a right to found an establishment in the Isle of Karrak and another in Ormuz. These conditions would appear to be independent of the evacuation of lHerbt by the Persians, and the abandonment of Bushire by the English. The English Government had demanded the right to appoint a Consul at Balfrush, a port of the Mazanderan on the Caspian Sea, but the Persian Envoy alleged that the existing treaties with Russia contain a clause prohibiting foreign diplomatic agents from residing on the shores of that sea, and no other foreign Power has an agent there; but she may enjoy the right of haviDg Consuls on several specified points in the interior of Persia, and on the shore of the Persian Gulf. If the conditions to be submitted to the English Government be accepted, Feruk Khan will probably go to London, merely for the ratification of the treaty between us and Persia.
Colonel Ouseley has been presented to the Emperor, who had a conversation with him on British lndia.

VIENNA, FEB. 23.
The Lower House was a few days since informed that Her Majestv's Government was not aware that any new treaty had been concluded between Russia and Persia; but it is well known here that the district of Maku has been ceded by Persia to her powerful neighbour, and it is not to be supposed that such an important position was relinquished w ithout an equivalent of some kind or other having been promised by Russia. In his letter of the 18th inst. your Paris correspondent, on the authority of accounts, dated January 25,which had been received by the French GIovernment from the frontiors of Asia, announces " the cession to Pwussia of the territory which extends from the frontiers of Turkish Armenia between Bayazid and Nakhtschivan." Aletter of mine, which appeared in T7ie Times on the 28th of January, contained some information conceruing MaLu, or Makoo, which is the territory in question, and I repeat it now with some details that have since come to my knowledge. The district of Mralaik lies between the Araxes on the east, the Alsas (a tributary of the Araes) on the south, the frontier line of the Turkish province of Bayazid on the west, and the boundary of Russian Armenia on the north. At the north-western extremity of the district of Maku is the Lesser Ararat, and on its southern frontier is the town of Makn, which is strongly fortified, and completely commands the caravan-road between Bayazid and Nakhtschivan. Full two months ago you learnt from me that the Russians were " remarkably busy " on both sides of the Caspian, and we now learn that forts have been built near the mouths of the rivers Attruck and Gourgon. The statement of the Moniteur de la Flotfe, that forts have been constructed on the east coast of the Caspian, " for the protection of the caravans coming from Khiva," is probably correct, for private information has reached me that several wells have recently been dug between the Caspian and Khiva.

BERLIN, Fan. 24.
Anong the many changes that the late war in Russia and the subsequent return to a state of peace, under a younger and a milder Emperor than he who had plunged the country into war, have produced in that country, not the least is the change produced in the public press. Though all the expectations that were formed during the war, and more especially during the coronation, have not been entirely fulfilled, the change is great enough to constitute it a remarkable era in the internal development of the country. At the commencement of thewar,andunderthe auspices of the late Emperor, the press was. nade use of, as on all former occasions, first to mislead the people as to the origin of the war, and then to infuriate them against the Christian Powers that were committing that fearful crime against Christendom in supporting the obstinacy of Islamism against the just demands of the head of the Orthodox Church. The proclamation of a holy war against the infidel led the Russian press to an organized system of attack upon the foreign policy of the Powers that defendedthe cause of the Turk; on the other hand, the unusual liberality that was shown at St. Petersburg-much more so than at Warsaw-with regard to the admission of foreign newspapers, and the small amount of blacking that the censor's brush inflicted on their columns, led to the belief that in future questions of foreign politics, at any rate, were to be set free from the trammels of the censor. This expectation has not been entirely disappointed since the return of peace; foreign polities are treated still with a degree of freedom and candour unknown before; but the resumption of diplomatic relations and the return to a leas hostile state of feeling towards other nations require many considerations to be shown now that were disregarded during the war. One restriction more particularly appears to be laid upon Russian journals in their philippics against foreign countries-viz., not to attack their internal affairs, but to confine themselves to the foreign politics of each State; but this very freedom accorded to its own press on foreign polities compels the censor to be more strict with regard to what articles in the foreign press he shall permit to remain legible to the writers at home. As a singular consequence of this may be mentioned that the one subject on which the Russian national feeling isjust now most exacerbated is precisely that which is ke.pt most out of sight, for fear of the consequences, m the home press, viY., the conduct of Austria during the late war, and her tardy withdrawal from the Danubian Principalities.
Although the reading of newspapers in Russiahas fallen off very considerably since the termination of the war, its present amount remains considerably greater than it was before its commencement. We are told that there is now hardly a petty fort to be found on the Asiatic frontier that does not receive by every post its copies of the Insvalide and the .Vwi.hemn Bee; the civil officials more particularly
take in thhela 'tter, while th e miitary c llub together to have the former read aloud to them. The con'viction of the great avidity with which this new source of enjoyment is resorted to by such widely extended classes, and the extreme susseptibility of feeling of the lower order of Russians, seem to strengthen the Government in the conviction that they must not yet entirely relieve the press of its censorship.
One consequence of the cessation of the war and the abeyance of the exciting material it had produced was, that the energies of the different journ aals were tured e towards the new fields of thought
and e nterpri rs which the altered circumstan c Of th counttry, the destruction of some longcherished delusions, and the awakening of new andl
attractive aspira tions, tallying intimately with the passage from war to peace, from Nicholas to Alexander, opened up. uJne o f the first forms in which
th~is mianiifested itself was in furious onslaughts o n each other's politics ana principles as regaared war
or peace, aggression or passiveness, protective or
financid l duties, and, last of all, railways or no railways. What the press has hitherto published on these
rubjects evinces clearly that, however muc h they had been hitherto excluded from public ex-
amination, they have been maturely studied by numerous individuals, who now profit gladly by this new opening to indoctrinate their fellowsubjects on many points not hitherto mooted in public. In addition to many well-written articles, full of information on special subjects, one now finds daily leading articles on the political news of the day, and moreover, now that the Jourwal of the Academy has once set the example, telegraphic dee spatches from various important places in Europe have figured in the daily papers since the beginning of this year. It is true, these latter are not quite so numerous, nor the intelligence quite so early, as one was led to expect at the turn of the quartewhen the various papers, with a view to increased sale, puffed off their intentions for the future; nevertheless, that they at all receive and print politicl1 messages received by telegraph is a proof that the Government has relaxed in their favour the prohibition it formerly placed on the transmission of political news by electric wires for other than official persons.
The tone of feeling towards the rest of Europe exhibited by the Russian press at the conclusion of the war resolved itself into three main featureseourteous egards towards France, rage against England, and deep hatred against Austria. Of these three the last is the only one that seems to have undergone no change since then. The violent affection for France has cooled down to a point considerably lower than that manifested by the French press towards Russia; while, on the other hand, the rage and anger that were formerly entertained towards England have given place to a much more moderate feeling of animosity, vwhich shows every disposition to merge into something like tranquil toleration, and a putting up with past grievances for the sake of future advantages. The circumstances that England, in spite of her Parliamentary form of government, offers a more stable alliance than France, on account of her own greater internal solidity, that her finances are still unimpaired by the war, and that the new career of industrial development which Russia is now entering on makes English workshops and English capitalists necessary, have doubtless contributed largely to this end; Russia knows England to be a very troublesome enemy, a good political ally, and an excellent busiuess connexion.
Wreck Of The Madrid Steamer.
WBECK OF THE MADRID STEAMBR.
SOUTHAMPTON, 1EB. 26.
A telegraphic message from London was received about midday at the offices of the Peninsular and Oriental Comn-
n m this town, announcing that the company's steamer Madrid, with the outward Peninsular mails, struck on a rock on the 20th inst. while entering the harbour of Vigo, but that all on board were happily saved.
The Madrid is one of the oldest and smallest of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels. She was 480 tons, and 140 horse power. She left here on the 17th inst., under the command of Captain G. Bradshaw, and took out, besides the mails, 18 passengers, 26,8571. in specie for Cadiz, and a miscellaneous cargo. The Alhambra, on her arrival here on Monday morning, reported having spoken the Madrid at 1.30 p.m. on the 2uth inst. off Salbira Island, bound for Vigo, whieh must have been but a short tine before the tor4nate steamer met with this disaster.
Nothing further is known here of the accident or the condition of the ship.
Immediately on receipt of the messaie here the necessary measures were taken by the compana ssuperintendent at this port, Captain Engledue, to get assistance ready for despatch by their steamer Tagus, Captain Christian, which leaves to-morrow for Vigo, &c., with the regular Peninsular mails of the 27th.

The Strike Of Navvies At The Birkenhead
'THE STRIKE OF NIB TTEAD Docxwoltxs.-LKEFOOL, FPeb. 26.-A meeting of the turn-outs, about QO iu number, was held at Birkenhead yesterday, at which it was stated that the object of the strike was to obtain an advance of 3d. a-day in their wages, making the sum 3s., instead of 2a. 9d. They asserted that there was no feelig by the Irish labourers against the employmnent of Etiglishmen. The men were advised by the speakers to be peaceable, and to rely upon the moral support of the public. This morning M7essrs. Thomson, the contractors, introduced about 4001labourers to supplo the places of the turn-outs. Before putting them to work Mr. Thormson applied at the Birkenhead Police-office for assistance, there being reason to fear that there would be a breach of the peace. The magistrates swore in a number of the fresh labourers as special constables. They proceeded to the works about 1 o clock this afternoon, but directly they commeneod operations the turn-outs swept down upon them in all their strength, and drove the new men before them in every direction, violently assaulting those who stood their ground, and doing considerable damage to the wheelbarrows and other iunplements. One of the overlookers (Dransfield) and a 1' chiefjanser" (Merryweather) were somewhat severely handle. Mr Thomson and others subsequently waited upon the Birkenhead magistrates a second time, and obtained warrants against two men who apesred to be the ringleaders of the rioters, and Inspector airne was ordered to pet them in force. He stated that le could only spare 5ix men, and that that number would be totally inadequate for the purpose After some deliberation the magistrates decided to comn. nicate with Sir Harry Smith, stating that there were no troops at Liverpool or Birkenhead, and requesting that a troc? might be immediately forwarded from some other station. It is expected that a troop wll arrmve at Birkenhead to-morrow (Friday), probaby from Preston. Mr. Thomson assured our correspondent that the men have turned out in consequence of the jealousy of the Irish labourers in respet of the introduction of English navvies. He has told t em, he says, that if they have any complaint to make as to wages, to wait upon him, but that none of thema have done so.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONBY-MARKETani, CITYINTBTLLIGENCB.
Thursday Even,ing.
The English funds have remained to-day without variation, the market continuing to exhibit a favourable tone, although there was a renewed demand for money at 6 per cent. Consas were quoted 931 to J for money, and 9&4 to 94 for the account. For the 8th of April thelast transactions were at 941 to J. One cause of the demand for accommodation was the payment of 200,0001. on the new issue of Great Indian Peninsula shares. At the same time, however, it was understood that the India House had renewed some loans in the market at 5i per cent. Bank Stock left off at 219 t, 220; Reduced, 94 to J ; New Three per Cents., 94j to #; India Stock, 219 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98k to 4; India-bonds, 2s. discount to la. premium; and Exchequer-biLls, par to 3B, premium.
whervas again a full demand for discounts today, both mn the open market and at the Bank of England.
About 15,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation to the Continent.
Foreign securities have exhibited increased firmness, but Turkish was most extensively purchased. In the Six per Cents. transactions took place for money at 95k, a, 961, and ,; for the account, at 96k, 4, J, and i-; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for money at 101a and *,and for the account 101i. The general operations were-Peruvian, for money, 801 and J ; for the account,! 81; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Spanish Three per Cents., 40k and i; the New Deferred, for money, 24i ; for the account, 241; and Spanish Certificates, 6Q.
The Bank of France to-day have returned to their usual practice of discounting bills having 90 days to run. It was in October last that they adopted the resolution to exclude all bills of more than 60 days, and this was subsequently modified to 75 davs
th0 final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 70c. for money and 69f. 80c. for the account, showing a reaction of three-eighths per cent., consequent perhaps upon realizations effected after the above announcement.
The private letters from Paris assert that the stock of bullion in the Bank of France is now about 8,650,0001., showing an increase of 840,0001. since the monthly return published on the 13th inst.
The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been sold to-day at 61id. per ounce, being a decline of id.
Some of the principal proprietors in the North of Europe Steam Company had an interview with the cnairman and directors this afternoon, to ascertain if there were any adverse circumstances to account for the sudden fall in the shares which has recently taken place. The result was calculated to re-establish perfect confidence. Mr. Coleman, the accountant, attended, and confirmed the fact that every dividend hitherto paid has been clearly earned, and it was stated that although, owing to the ill-health of phe managing director, some of the traffic arrangements of the past Bix months may have been injudicious, there is nothing whatever to prevent them from being immediately placed on a satisfactory footing, or to interfere with the permanent prosperity of the undertaking. The Board hold between 4,000 and 5,000 shares, and the managing directorhas increased his own from 40 up to 300, which he still retains. All the routes maintained are remunerative, and full details will be furnished at the meeting in March, to enable each shareholder to form his own judgment on that and every other point.
At a meeting of the Victoria (London) Dock Company, held to-day, Mlr. C. Morrison presiding, the report was unanimously adopted. The directors were also authorized to take steps for converting the paid-up shares into stock. With regard to a BiU for which the Board are maldng application to Parliament, it was stated that the objects contemplated include an extension of time to complete the works on the additional land to the east of the docks, and the formation of an entrance at the south side, in addition to the one at Galleon's Reach. Permissive clauses have at the same time been introduced to allow a sale of the Steelyard property, if necessary, and to extend the lease of the Docks from its present term of 19 years to 99, should the shareholders and the lessees agree on terms. It was explained that if an extension of the arrangement is effected Mlessrs. Peto, Betts, and Brassev will form a company under theLimitedLiability Ace
with the view of providing the guarantee required for the extended period. A discussion took place with respeetto theaccountsof therevenueforthe year, some of the shareholders contending that they should have been presented. It was intimated by the chairman that they were not at present complete, but that the lessees, from the general knowledge they had of their position, were satisfied with the result of the first year's working, although, beyond the 5 per cent., no surplus exists for division. The directors poasess power to examine the accounts and to aseertain tho progress of the earnings, but the lessees are not desirous of giving them publicity in the earlier stage of business. The following is an abstract of the report *
" The number of ships and tonnage which entered the dock during the past year were,-
In the fist aix months .. Wh Ton5. In the aeoond gi months .. .. 89 .. ,86
In the year I856 . 1541 .. 500,453

"The Victoria Dock has therefore already attained, in the first year from its o ning, a very satisfactory position in comparison with the o =-estahlished docks."t
The prospectus has been issued of the London Unadulterated Food Company, with a capital of 100,C001., in 201. shares. It is respectably constituted, and the object is to manufaeture and sell some of the articles of food which are most exposed to deleterious admixture in a form that wil guarantee their genuineness. Dr. Letheby is to be the chief analyst, and tho names of the various dealers authorized to sell the company's goods will be advertised in the local papers throughout the country. A regulation is proposed that shareholders shall have the privilege of purchasing at wholesale prices, but any such distinction will soon be found to be attended with inequalities and difficulties, and the fair method wiU be simply to divide profits when all have paid alike.
The prospectus has been issued of the London Investment Company, with a capital of I 00,0001. in 101. shares, for the purpose of affording facilities analogous to those of savings-banks, but of an extended character.
It is estimated that the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Tagus will to-morrow take out about 55,0001. in bar gold for Cadiz.
At the colonial wool sales, which commenced to-day, there was a full attendance, and an advance was obtained of 2d. per lb. on Cape wools, and of 3d. on Australian. The quantity to be disposed of is about 38,266 bales.
The following account of the wine trade and its prospects is furnished by Messrs. Matthew Clark and Sons:-
" On the 1st of November we gave the results of the vintage of last year in Europe. Unfavourable as r7ere the reports from the various wme-growing countries then, they have been thoroughly confirmed since; and the best evidence is to be found in the continued rise that has taken
aoe in prces, and in the fact of these countries havine ecolme large importes of corn spirits from England ana Germany, not having wines to mnake spirit for their own consumption.
"' The wine-market here during the past year eas exhi. bited constant activity, the demand having been steady throughout, The importation of all the prinoipal descrip. tions has been large, but not more than the home and export deliveries justify; consequently stocks at the outports at the close of 1856 oould not have exceeded those of the previousyear. At this port they 'were nearly equal; the stocks in bond of port, sherry, marala, and cape aniountin, on the31st of December, 1855, to abouto63,700 pipes, and in 18a6 to 53,000 pipes,;
In reviewing the trade in wines in 185G the most striking fe^ture is the great amount of business done, notwithlstandingthe continuous rise in prices and the tightness
of money. Looking Pt the deliveries aS the really true test of trade, we find that the quantity of ~rines brought in for homie consuxmption is a full average, exceeding that of last 7'ear by 6,500 pipes; and, althougrh p ie aeduld n
in some instanices trebled, durin thenlesth10eydaublye, thd totl hmedelver-i well xupported. The same remark aLpplies to the export delivery, which allows an exgg over 1n85 of upwards of 4,800 kipes giving evidence that by tlto foresight of our merchaLnts in importing freely Ire have beehi able to supPly other oountries at remunerative prices,. and in most instances on better terms than supplies coud h_ v been obtained from the producing country. Idhv
" In looking to the futur promise of trade in wines we mnust naturally be guided by the circurmstances which havet influenced demand of late. The general prosperty of the country and the termination of the war have doubtless had great effect in stimulating consumptioni, but we thinkc the xmain cause has been the desire generally felt by consumiers to lay in larger private stocks than nasal in consequence of their attention having beeni drawn to the failure of succesive vintages, and the consequent certainty of enhancemnent of prices; and itis not too mnuch to say that up to the present time the consumers have experienced to avery smallextent the increase of pm rc; the dealers throughout the kingdoma as a rnle, haLve Ien Satisfied to work- off their old stocks, at a small advance, and it is only of late that a general ris at all proportionate to existing mnarket rates has been de. mianded. For these reason;, we cannot but look for a circumuscribed trade in wines during the next few years;- but, limited as the demand maRy he~, it will fully equal, if it does not exceed, the supply, for whatever may be the result of fuiture vinitages, the stocks ol old wines fit for use must he now so reduced' that the difficulty will be to meet even a small demnand during the timne that must elapse before Such qualities can be replaced.
" It is at present too early to obtain any reliable informnation as to the appearance of the vines (although some letters from Oport o already speak of the bad conditionL of the plan s up thieDeuro), hut the experience of this scourge in other countries is opposed to the haope of speedy relief, and leads us to look forward to its reappearanoe zor some few ears to come. While, then, we expect a, less demand, we al'so look forastilllesssupply, and therefore consider that all stocks of well-matured wanes in wood and bottle rswst go on increasing in value."
