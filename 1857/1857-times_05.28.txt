TNBy.11 MARKBT and OITYINTBLLIGENO . Wednesday Evening. Although the extent of business to-day has been limited, the funds have shown a tendency to im-: provement. Consols for money opened at the closing prices of last evening-93i to i, and steadily' advanced to 93i to 94. The final quotations were 93 for money, 93S to 94 for the 4th of June, andc 949 ,o i (or 93i to i ex dividend) for the neT account on the 9th of July. The market was chiefly influenced by some investments on the part of the publi, while the regular daily purchase of S0,0001. Exchequer-bills for the Commissioners of Savingsbanks likewise tends to increase the supply of money. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 924 to i; New Three per Cents., 921 to i; India Stock, 220 to 222; Exchequer Bonds, 9%q to 99; India Bonds, 8s to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, June, Ii. to 3s. premium; March, 4s. to 6s. premium. In the Stock-Exchange to-day money was freely offered on short loans at 6 per cent. In the discount market and at the Bank the demand shows no; abatement. Foreign securities have exhibited rather more firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 94#, i, and -; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 1014-. 'the other business comprised-Noew Granada, 224 and i; Mexican Three per Cents., 224; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46 ; Russian Five per Cents., 108; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 974; Sardinian Eive per Cents., 91i; Spanith Three per Cents., for account, 42; Venezuela, for account, 38i; Belgian Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 57 ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97i. the corn-market was steady this morning at the improved rates of Monday last. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. 30c. for. both money and accounit, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent. An arrival of about 30,00( sovereigns is expected from Constantinople by the Ottoman Bank, in addition to the 42,0001. just received. The amount from Russia to-day (about 50,0001.) will be taken' chiefly for the continent to pay for silver. Of the 180,0001. Australian gold which reached London! this afternoon a portion will go to the Bank. The following communication, ingarding the failure of M. Charles! Thurneymsen, is from M.' Isaac Pereire, the Preiddent of the Cr6dit Mobilier, Company:- "Paris, May25. "Sir,-In announcing the failure of IML Charles Thur-' neyssen, you have referred to the Credit Mobilier, and have also stated that he was connected with me by relation.- ship and business transactions. " Your good faith has been imposed upon by statements emanating from malicious motives, for AL Charles Thur-' neyssen has never had any business counexion either with me or with the Credit Mobilier. He was never at any time; mixed up with the operations conducted by that establish.' ment, nor a director of railway companies orother industrial: undertakldngs. "The insinuations therefore regarding the Credit Mo-. bilier aro without foundation, nor have they any better' basis as respects myself. Although a cousin of Mi. Charles Thurneyssen married one of my nieces, he can scacely be' looked upon as my relative; and I have never had soci4 intercourse or business transaCtions with him. I regret that this abuse of the privileges of the press should render' it necessary for me to enter into my private affairs; but I feel bound to add that on one occaon I rendered a service to M. Charles Thurneyssen, solely out of regard to his family, and that I have suffered in consequence. About three and a balf years ago I lent him 500,OO0f. to extricate him from the embarrassments into which he was plunged by speculations in land, and that sum is stiU due to me. "His uncle, I. Augusta Thumeyssen, whose dediciog years are embittered, and whose fortune is largely. diminisbed, by this painful event, is one of the most hijgrh. esteemed ad respected men in Paris. He was fonmermy a banker, and connected with the house of Stieglitz, and for the last 20 years his name has been associated with those of the most respectable English and French capitalists as X director of the principal railways. Like his son, M.' George Thurneyssen, it is only as a creditor that he is connected with his nephew's failure, which, depiorable as it is, does not possess the exaggerated importance which hat been attached to it. " I doubt not, Sir, that, having given currency to reports so unfounded, you wil give equal publicity to these explaJ nations. Every one has a perfect right to form his owni estimate of the Credit hfobilier as an institution, but It is I an abuse of that right, and one unworthy of the Enlish press, to connect that society with events to wvhich it is completely a stranger, and to attack it through its administrators, v ho are at least entitled to some consideration from the position they occupy in public esteem. " I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "IL PERIERE." These statements are simply a series of misconceptions. M. Pereire complain that M. Charles Thurneyssen was represented by The Times to be connected with him by relationship and in businmes transactions. Also that The Times has indulged in insinuations against the COndit Mobilier, and that its good faith has been imposed upon for malicious purposes, M. Charles Thurneyssen never having been mixed up with the operations of that establishment, nor a director of railway companies or other industrial undertakings. The only reply is that The Times never stated M. Thurneyssen to be a relative of M. Pereire, nor that he was connected with him in business. Neither has it indulged in insinuations against the Credit Mobilier, nor asserted thatIM. Charles Thur. neyssen was a director of railway companies or of any other industrial undertakings. The Times stated that the family of M. Charles Thurneyssen is nearly " connected " with that of ML Isaac Pereire; that he is a nephew of M. Thurneyssen, the well, known banker, and that with such connexions be was not likely to have been driven to the necessity of flight if his responsibilities had been of the comparativel;y insignificent characte (from 30,0001. to 80,0001.) alleged by the principal friends of his family in London. The perfect accuracy of the whole of this information is now vouched by x Isaac Pereire himself, who mentions a former act of generosity, which proves that his family interest in M. Thurneyssen was precisely of the character indicated, and adds that the failure did not occur until the fortune of the elder MX Thurneyssen had been largely diminished by th9 conduct of the defaulter. Thus then the only incorrectness is on the part of M. Pereire in supposing there has been any error, and the sole imposition upon good faith would have been by publishing his letter without an explanation of its errors AL Pereire, while seeking to use the press to bring groundless charges of malicious motives a,anst others, considers the slightest allusion t6 himself or to the company of which he is the head to be an abuse of its functions and privileges. ' !. Pereire has not, as he states, been forced by the press to enter into his private affairs, The family connexion of M. Charles Thurmeysen with AK Pereire aud M. Auguste Thurneymen is a public affair, and M. Pereire must be well aware that it was in some degree owing to this publicity that M. Charles Thurneyssen obtained the financial standing which has enabled him to incur his present liabili ties. M. Pereire is not necessarily answerable for this, and nothing was said to lead to such animpression. With respect to insinuations against the Credit Mobilier, the views entertained of that undertaking must have been very imperfectly expressed if they can wear to any one the aspect of "Ainsinuations." Theywere intended to convey,in the plainest manner languagp would allow, that the principle upon which it is based, of permitting a combinatooa of capitalists to assume to monopolize and "regu.- late " the enterprise of a great nation, to act as a sentinel whose motions shall supersede the private judgment of the commercial classes at large, and to proclaim that one of the chief duties a financiai obdy ow es to the State is to make advancea specu- lators to "keep up the pries of the public funds," is opposed to every doctrine of political economy, that it has already beentried in the United States and in England, and always with diatrous results, and that there is little reason to hope that the lessons of former experience will be reversed by the ultimate example of the Cr edit Mobilier. It was also intimated that having arrogated to itself the duties of a sentinel the ompany must surely feel partially responsible, if not for every financial eivil at least for such dissater as those of M. Place and M. Thurneymen, both of which have happened within 12 months and under its very eyes. Open remarks of this kincd may perhaps seem to AL Pereire an abuse of the privileges of the press as those privileges are understood in Paris, but he has challenged them by advertising the reports of the Credit Mobilier in the London papersm Finally, it may be difficult for M. Pereire, in the p tculiar atni sphere to which he is Accustomed, to conceive that any unfavourable observatiens can be made upon the policy and proiceedings of the Credit hIobilier which have no t been prompted by rivalries or animosities. A mon g Enghmh gentlemen the attempt to influence a question b y such imputations wo uld at once prove stat, but x Pereire is, doubtless, fixed in hi ` imagininga The annoyance experienced fro m "interste d and jealous riticiss" formed a prom nent them e in his rec nt a eport. It will therefore, it is to be fear, prove uWeS to apuq h2m himat the information lately given, and which has led to the above letter, was obtained from persons not merely of financial rank, but who are believed to entertain for him the esteem to which, according to general testimony, he is from his personal character and kindness of disposition thoroughly entitled. At the annual meeting of the National Bank, held to-day, Mr. P. Newsam presiding, the report and aceounts were adopted. It was stated that during the temrorary run in December last the directors sent to Ireland 400,0001. in gold, and that the arrangerients made enabled them to meet all demands with promptitude. The members of the board are not indebted one shilling to the bank, and a careful examination of the share register shows complete regmlarity. Annexed is an abstract of the report - " The accounts of the advancing prosperity of Irish interests is confirmed. The banldng business in London continues to advance satisfactorily. The result of the transactions for the year ending 31st of December, 1856, will be seen from the folowing statements, viz.:- " First, from profit and loss account, which now sbtnds as follows:- B3 undivided profits at Dcoember, S855 . .. .. 6,82 9 Br net profit for the year 1856, aftr wrting of aU bad debtsandprovidlngfordoubtfulones .. ,. .. 0,951 1 3 £137,433 10 0 Dsouct shareholders dividend, June, 1565.. £13.f0 e Bonus paid In July .. . .. 10.,00 Shareholders' diidend to Dcemober, - . 1, 37,000 0 0 lanoe3Slat Decmber,185 .. ., .. £ICO.433 10 0 "Next, as regards the asets [and liabilities in the year 1856:- Asrsra A d.

The National Bank, having the moat branches inthat districts had to bear the storm in its greatest force; but the directors have Rothing to regret in being thus casually placed, on that occasion, in so prominent a position, since the result must prove that the directors had their resoureea promptly at command; and the foregoing account of tha assets of the bank, immediately after the excitement had ended, must show how fully prepared they were for all contingencies. Very nearly the whole of the gold then sent over, being no longer required, has been returned to this country, and is agaun profitably employed. The deposits and circulation have risen to nearly half a million more than at this fsme last year, and such investments as were for the moment disturbed have been replaced even at some little profit; while at no time was the usual acoommodation to the customers of the bank in any way curtailed. The directors, observing the difficulty which the officers of tbe bank frequently experienced in providing satisfactory security for the faithful discharge of their duties, and feeling for the destitute situatlonin which manyof their wives and families are often placed, when overtaken by misfortunes over which they have no control, have, with the concurrence of the officer, established an 'Officers' Guarantee Fund,' which on reaching a certain maximum amount will become a superannuation fund and be placed under their own management, for the benefit of those who have been at least 20 years in the service of the bank, or for the relief of their WidoWs or families To establish this fund upon a solid basis the board unanimously resolved, with the approbation of the proprietors, to contribute to it the sum of 2,000l. and they now confidently appeal to this meeting to confirm this grant. At the end of last year an amalgamation was effected between the National Bank and the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir Banks. Up to that period, though the National was always mutually interestd in these banks, they were separate aud-distinct establishments, having their own proprietary and directors, and being regulated by their own deeds, subject, however, to the supervidon and veto of the London board. This joint administration being obviouslymore expensive and inconvenient than A mananagement under one responsible control, it haw long been the wish of the directors to bring about a union of the three proprietadies, and for that parposo they from time to time purchased, or obtained by effecting An exchange of metropolitan stock at par, a great part of the shares of those institutions, and since the amalgamation the remainder of them have been secured; so that the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, hitherto independent banks, have now merged into and form an integral part of the National Bank, which society, by authority of the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue, has obtained the right of issue to the extent of 90,l21., formerly possessed by those banks, and the three establishments are now become one and the same, under the sole control and management of the London directors. " The paid-up capitals of the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir Banks amoumted, as appears in the foregoing accounts of assets and liaboilities, to 33,721., and their reserve funds to 69211. 18x 2d, making together 40,6421. ISs. 2d., of which t e National Bank has now acquired sole possession, by purchase or in exchange for the Metropolitan stock at par, as is shown under the head of assets, at the cost of 32,518. 13s. 9d., being a balance in favour of the National Bank from this purchase of 8,1241 4s. Xd; besides which direct advantge the National Bank secures a lucrative and promising increaseto its business. From the first establish. ment of the National Bank, up to 1851, there were accumulated ln the hands of the directors a numberof shares; eitherfromforfeiturefornon-paymentofcals, orfromvarious other causes, at a price somewhere about par. Of these shares the directors availed themselves, as far as wa4 neessr, to effect the settlement with the Clonmel and Crrick-on-Suir shareholders; the others they have beeni gradually disposing of £n the market, as favourable oppor. tunities offered; and between the price they stood at in the boolks and the price they have now realized the result has been a profit of 11,9761 14s. lld, and adding to this sum the disposable fund accruing to the bank from the amalagaM tion of the Cionmel and Carrick.on-Soir Banks; 8,1241. 4s. 5d., there wil bel then, together, the sum of 20,1001. 19a. 4d. at the disposal of the shareholders " But, as the ccession of the business of the Clonmel nd Carnick-on.Suir Banls by the National Bank maT fairly call for an increase of its capital, at least commensurate with the awount of local stock absorbed, the directors recommend that the paid-up capital of the National Bank now 450,0001., being 22 lOs. on 20,000 shares, shall be raised to 50,0001,, and to effect this object they propose to apply in part the forementioned sum of 20,1001. 19s. 4d and to take from the reserve fund the balae,_-say, 29,M91 Os. 3d. ; mafking, together, the sum required of 50,0001. So that from the lgt of Janumry, 1807, evet F share wmll represent 251 paid up, being a bonus of 21. lOs. per share in stock; and, ou this reeommendation being approved and adopted by the proprietors, they wiU receive a ividend upon 251 per share, at the rate of6eroent per annunm, free of income-tax, in July next. The captabring of this 29,8991. out of the reseve fund will tem. porarily reduce it to 70,534, but from the present working of the bank the directors have ever reason to believe that by the next annual general 3neetme it will have again reached, if not exceeded, the amount it had attained at the end of syear." The prospectu has been issued of the Hartlepool Colliery Company, with a capital of 65,0001. in 5t. shares. he object is to extend the developement of the Rodridge Colliery and Fie-brick ad Coke Work; about seven miles from 13artlenool. The directors of the Sanbre and Meuse ,saiway have entered into negotiations for an amalgamation with the Louvain and Charleroi and Moralm6 and ChAtelineau lines, which, it is calculated, will be enerally beneficial by inereasing the traffic and diinshngexpenditure. The details are still under discua ion.

CIfH4 GE OF CONSPIRABCY. John Hind May, of Huggin-lano, city, and Stanley-street, iPimlico, agent; Wiinam Taylor, of 1, Church-passage, -(lresbanm-steet, agent; and George David Myers, of 4, iAlvern-terrace, Ialington, ahso described as an agent, but iho is reported to be a wealthy man, appeared before Al-derman Humphery, at Gaildhall, for final examination zlativ-e to the charge of conspiracy to defraud Mr. Gorman, ,o Lurgan, in the county of Armagh, Ireland, of a qua%tity -of cambrio handkerchiefs to the value of about 5001., and .lMr. Lawson, a manufacturer of the same part, of similar goods to the value of about 6001. The depositions taken on the last ocoasion having been rasd over to and confirmed by the various witnesses -exnamined, Middleton, the officer in the case, said,-I wish to add something to my evidence, which I omitted on the last exanimantion. When Myers told me he saw May about the handkerchiefs he said he had told Mlay he understood *Gorman was in the habit of sending up goods inferior to aample. Cross-examined by Mr. Hawkinl.-I forgot to mention -that inmy former evidence. Myers spoke in a rather flurried manner in his conversation with me. I am certain Myers did -not say that May bad told him Gorman was in the habit of sending up goods inferior to sample Edwardllenry Davis, clerk from the 'Union Bank, recalled, said,-hMyers and May had separate accounts at the Union Bank. On the 12th of March last a check for 1241. 'was presented by Myers, aad it was returned on the followang day. I do not know whose check that was, but it was -dishonoured. It was drawn on the IJnion Bank. There was a bill, to which May was a party, for 231. 16s. Gd., which was returned to Myers on the 10th of March. That bill was originally for 231. 15s., and it was paid in to Myerf?s account on the 14th of March, and the cost of noting made it 231. 16s. Gd. A check for 301., drawn by Myers, on the 3d of April, and made payable to May, 'was paid by oar bank and debited to Myers's account on the 4th of April. It was a orossed check, and was credited to May's account. There was also on the 4th of April a check for 81i. 10s., drawn by 31yers and payable to May, ibut I do not find it credited to May's account. The check for 1241., on the 12th of March, was debited to Myers's account, but it does not appear in May's account. It would Ptot, if dishonoured. Alexander Lawson was then examined and said,-I reside at Lm-gan, in the county of Annagh, Ireland. I am a imanufacturer of cambric handkerchiefs. I received a letter from Taylor dated the 6th of December, 1856, in which he informed me that Mr. Swallow, from Copestake and Co., would be at Lurgan and would look at the goods in bulk, as he was not content with sample dozens, and recommended me to try all I could, as they did a large trade and pad cash. He also said that if he had had the bulk he could have got offers for the goods from two parties. At Taylor's suggestion that he should have the stock I sent up four cases, containing about 2,600 dozen of cambric handkerchiefs, and I afterwards received a letter from him, dated the 27th of December, 1856, in which he stated that the collector had called for the amount of 21. or 31. for the carriage of the goods, and asking for directions as to paying it and sending back the empty cases. Upon the receipt of that letter I sent up Henderson's (the shipping agent) receipt for the carriage to the door, and on the 15th of January 'Taylor wrote again that he had introduced my goods into two houses, and hoped to have a final answer that day. He expressed a wish that the jobbing was over, and said my Lurgan neighbours were keeping it up with a vengeance; and vith regard to another case of goods he advised me to send it forward at once. In consequence of that letter I sent up two cases, containing 916 or 926 dozen, I forget which, of handkerchiefs, and I afterwards received a letter from him, dated the 24th of January, acknowledging the arrival of the two cases of goods, and statillg that he would not send me a bad bill, but that if I was afraid he would guarantee the accounts, including lais commission for 4 per cent. Taylor wrote to me asaim an the 14th of February to say that Morley and Nep!hew would take my goods at 17. off, and 2.& and 60 days from the 20th of the month; but that he thought if pushed they would take them at 15 off, and 2. and 90 days. In that letter he enclosed me the account rties of the goods to May, consisting of 1,701 dozens at 4501. 8s. 2d., which, after deducting 124 and 101. 2s. 2d. for discount, &o., left a balance of 3841. The terms were one bill for 1841. at a month, and another bill for 2C31. at three months, Mr. Morgan.-I shall prove that these goods were sold to MeeIg for a suni of 2731. Is. on the 12th of Febz uary, and that they were tAken direct from Taylor's to Meeking's without going to May's at all. Mr. Buddleston.-You wil find that is not the case. Mr. Lawaon.-I received a letter dated the 21st of Mlarch from Taylor, which stated he had cleared the whole of my goods, and that I should have the cash for the large lot, amounting to 3001., on the 28th of March, but that he could aot get the cash for the aniall entries until the middle of April. lIe said the other 1,000 were in and opencd, and that he would tiy and sell them the following week. Mr. Morgan.-I shall show that these 690 dozen were sold to Meeking for 1931. on the 13th of March, and that a check was given for 601. less than they were offered at. MIr. Huddleston.-You have made your speech, Mr. Morgan, pray go on vith the case. Mr. Lawson.-On the 31ht of March I received a letter 'From Taylor dated the 28th, enclosing sales and statement of account balanced for all sold, by which it appeared that tho sales on the 12th of February amounted to 3841.. and on the 7th, 18th, and 28th of March they amounted to 3931. 3s. Gd uiaking a total of 7771. 3s. i6d., from which had to be deducted 201. 9s. 2d. for Taylor's charges for commission, &o., and this account was balanced by bills sent for 3841., 761 12s. 6d., and a check for 2961. 2s. Thinking I might be depending on the amount for these goods he enclosed me his acceptance at 90 days to use until he got the cash for them. The check for 2961. 2s. referred to in that account was enclosed in the letter. It was drawn by May, on the Union Bank, and payable to me. The amount of the check was lesm the commnssion, some 201. odd. The bill for 2001. was drawn by me and accepted by May. It was sent tome slready drawn out, and I signed it. It was drawn at three =onths, and dated the 14th of February. There was another bill for 1841. of the same date, and drawn at one month and accepted by May. Both bills were enclosed to me in the letter I rec2ived from Taylor on the 16th of February. 'These biUll were for the first lot of goods. I paid the 1841, biUl away and heard no more of it, but the 2001. bill was dithonoured. The check for 2961. was also dishonoured. I paid it into the Northern Bank of Ireland on the same day that 1 got it, and it was returned, there being no funds to mneet it when presented. I Plso had a bill of Taylor's acceptance for 761. 12s. 6d. which was paid before it was due. I did not ask him for his acceptance, and he had no right to send itto me. On the 9th of April I received the following letter from Taylor:- ", Ohurch-passage, Gssaham-street. I.ofdon. lir. A. lawson, *- Tuesday night. April 7. 1857. Dear sir-On receipt of yours yesterday I went to 'ay's srome eight or teu times. Sb was not to be found.

Turner the soma icitor, and ar. evi anacouentilbeneaots tame tt cses former representeb Taylor, and the latter May, and the result of our interview wa thati Goman was to brizng an action against Myers. I did not receive the same advice in my case, as I did not take counsel's opinion upon it. I received thisXletter from Taylor, dated the 25th of April " Mr. A.A Yawson 1", Churah-passage, London, Apil 2, A8157.

I will be glad 20 hear from you. and Dal I can I will do to eaeve you. *'Very italy, yours, W. TAYLOR." Mr. Lawson.-I know Mr. M'Cnllagh. About the latter end of March last he showed me the two letters produced, addressed to him by Taylor. In the letter of the 18th of March, Taylor says, " I referred your friend Gorman to Mr. May, as a man who wanted his handkerchiefs. You're mistaken, I did not want his goods. You must stick to me with goods and I wll to you. We shall have a hard fight; but we vill work a trade yet. I have cleared Lawson's little lot, all save the case in this day, and I shall hope remit Ihin cash and particulars on Saturday first." In the letter of the 253th of March from Taylor to hr. M'Cullagh; he says, "M May has not got the other partner he spoke to you about, nor is he likely to make any change. Gorman's goods are going in to him, but M3 ers and Co. buy them, and find the cash when due." Mr. M'Cullagh told me in January that May owed him about 5001, or 6C01. for goods. I never saw Taylor until I came up in April. Mlr. Eawkins.-What charge have you against Myers? Mr. Morgan.-I have put Mr. Lawson in the box as a vwitness, and I advise him not to answer that question, for mso man is bound to answer a question which may tend to prejudice himself. Alderman EItrumpnmy.-I see no harm in his answering the question. Mr. Lawaon has lost his goods, and no doubt wishes to get them back or to punish the parties who have got them from him Mr. MIorgan.-I object to it because these gentlemen have aow, been in London three weeks upon this matter, and they -cannot walk through the streets or stir a step without having threats held out to them for taking these pro-aseedin at is quite true, and when I was at the 4)ystal Pe thetheyer day a lady who keeps a stall for tlhe e of needles held out threats to me if I prosecuted these gs ~ any further, but I am not afraid of them, nor of eanyacion talhgey ay rn gainmsntme. I have sigDned the Mr. awEuns.-I am quite content with that answer. leruas XIvHautY,-I 805 b2r thiss ~JIYQ1G5 tb ileeking bought these goods at 42. p-r cent. discoun:, 'a blo is an important eiroeumstance. | r- organ.-I believe tho discount is 45 per cent, Sir. Alderman auHVPH;Ry.-It appear. tbat goods to the aIount of 4701. are sold by May, and Meeding's buyer deducts 2001., making the discount 42J per cent. It will be necessary for you to prove this invoice, as it shows that the goods were sold to Meeking on the 12th of February, when in Taylor's letter of advice about the sale he states they were not sold to May until the 14th of February, two days after. Mr. Lawson, cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-Taylor has been my agent since September last. The first,parcel of goods I sent mim amounted to 2856., after deducting 15 per cent. These goads were, I believe, sold to May, and were paid for. They did not at first tell me they were sold to May.and the goods were paid for by acrossed check of Talor's for somne 2001. or more, I never saw the check produced, dated October 11, for 2171 until now. I did receive a check for 61U.163.;1id, and 12s. in cash. I was paid for the goods on the 10thofDecember.Thenexttransac. tion was on the 14th of February,and wvs for 384.,for which I received the two bills for 2001. at three months and 1841 at one month. The 1841. was p aid, but I never receivcd a fraction upon the last parcel of goods. There is a balance of about 5001. now due from May to me. I have not received 201. nor 20 farthings in cash, but Taylor received 201. Os. 2d. for his commission. Charle;s Lain; said,-I am a oarman in the employ of Thomas Fardeil, carmen, of 40, Gresham-street. On the 12th of February last I went to No. 1, Church-passage, to fetch some goods from Taylor's warehouse, and on that day I took from there 131 boxes to MIr. Mfeeking's, on Holbor-. hill. On the 13th of March I took 54 boxes, and on the 16th 55 boxes. I took them all from Taylor's warehouse to Mr. Meeking's. hlr. Huddleston. -You will fand, Mr. Morgan, that is not the case; he did not take them direct to Meeking's. Witness,-Taylor was present when I took the first lot away, and a young man from May's went with me to deliver atMeekinp's, butltook adelivery-book,which I got signedfor the goods i took on the other two occasions. When I got the godsinto ny cart Iwent to May's warehouse, inHuggin-lane, Por instructions where to take them. No one went with me from Taylor's, and no one at Taylor's told me where I was to go with the goods. I went to May on all three occasions for instructions as to where the goods were to be delivered. Cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-I have carried goods for May about four times-once from Huggiu-lane and three times from Taylor's warehouse. I believe May has an account with Fardell, and I believe this job was booked to May, and thathe paid the account which was takeninto him for it. Cross-examined by Mr. Buddleston.-When I took the goods from Taylor's warehouse we were employed by May, and before going to Meeking's, after I had the goods in my cart, I inquired of May where they were to go. I had no instructions from Taylor whatever about these goods. I took them from Taylor's warehouse in the daytime. Samuel Lewis Whittingham.-I am a buyer of cambrio hendkerchiefs in Mr. Meeking's employ. I bought the goods contained in the invoice of the 12th of February, amounting to 4701. 15s. ld. They consisted of 131 boxes, containing 1.701 dozen of cambric handkerchiefs. The price I bought them at was 42i per cent. discount upon the invoice price. Alderman lUMPHErRY.-And that was what you considered to be the value of the goods? Witness.-No, Sir. The invoice price was what Mr. Gonman valued them at. I do not know who the goods belonged to, bht we bought them of May, suppo'ing him to be a respectable agent. I might have seen the samples, but I cannot say what day they were sent. On the first occasion you ma remember, Sir, it was said Mr. Meekino bought these nandkerehiefs at 50 per cent. discount, eud-" Mr. Martin.-Confine yourself to evidence. You are not here to defend Mr. Meekixg. Witnees.-Sometimes I have seen Blay, and at others Jary, but I do not know if I saw either of them on this occasion. Alderman HUMxPHnRY.-You must recollect whom you bong ht of. Witne8s.-There were several cases in which I did not see them, but I believe the goods came from May. Alderman flsUMpiIERy.-Bat thisfinvoice is for 4701., and you must therefore know of whom you bought such a large quantity of good,. Witness.-I was going to explain, and unless you allow me to do so I cannot tell you. On a previous occasion I had a diepute vzith Jary, and he therefore on this occasion went to W oodward, who brought the samples to me, and I fixed the p rice; hus Woodward bought them, so that I might ao nae seen either May or Jary. Aldernan HUallPsrrnuc.-What are these private marks on the invoice ? Witness.-They are the retail prices, and represent the profit 'we sell the goods at. Our profit upon this lot of goods is only 281. Alderman H11MPHZRY.-What ! only 28Z. upon 4701.? Witness.-No, Sir. You are mietaken. We bought these goods for 2701., and the 284 is the profit upon that amount. Alderman HUaIPnExRY.-Yes, yes; I understaid the 2001. off is the 42A per cent. discourt. Witness.-I marked upon the invoice the retail prices and it was then passed into the counting-house. We sold a great many of these handkerchiefs, but we had not our window full of them. MIr. Martin.-You sold a grept many in the shop? Witness.-We did. Woodward brought the samples to me. The invoice of the 13th of Mfarch is for 54 boxes. I bought them. The boxes contained 690 dozen handkerchiefs, and the invoice amounted to 1081. 7s. 6d., for which a check was given. The two checks produced for 1501. and 1231. are both signed in Mr. Meeking's handwriting. Mr. Morgan.-I mvrt here explamn, Sir, that the 42l discount was taken off these goods before the invoice was made out, so that there does not appear to have been any deduction made upon the invoice pncs. Alderman BimipPHRY.-Do you always take off 42. per cent. discount in all your other transactions ? Witness.-No, Sir. Alderman IlumruErY.-I mean with May. Witness.-Not always, Sir. I boughb the 55 boxes con- taining 725 dozen handkerchiefs on the invoice of the 16th1 of MIarcb, and the gross amount of the invoice was 1071. 15s. 3d. I cannot say if the 131 boxes delivered on the 12th of February are the same that Iang has spoken of, but I passed that quantity into our stock. The goods were', brought down into the marking-room by Meredith, our waresouseman, and I saw them there on that day. Cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-I have known May about fov.r or five months. We buy goods from a great many people. I do not know Myers. I never saw himt t at I know of untill saw him in court. I am quite slre I i never saw him before. I never bought goods of him through an agent. I buy many other things as well aa handkerchiefs I buy for three or four different departments. I do not know if Myers has sold goods to any of our otber depart. ments. I travel in the city to buy goods. We have bought gocds of a great many houses of long standing, very frequently at a very cheap rate, and of houses, too, the respectability of which no one would think of questionig. We have bought goods of such houses at as great a discount as in this instance, and greater. Some of them come and offer their goods to us. I have bought this class of goods of other horses at as low a rate, and they are houses that have stood the storm and are still goirg on. I should imagine it was a temporary pressure that induced them to se]l so low, but of course I do not know that of my owem knowledge. Alderman HIUMPHsnY.-You are implicating other houses by these questions, lr. Wontner, for you are asking the witness if other houses sell at 42i per cent. discount. Mr. Wontner.-I am implicating no one sir, for no names have been mentioned. Alderman HUIrnEsRY.-You have not known that other houses have been in diffloulties when you have bought their goods at 42. per cent. discount ? Witnes5.-No, Sir, but from the terms upon which the goods were sold to us we supposed they were pressed. Such pressure might induce manafacturers to sell their goods at so low a price, but it would not induce other wholesale houses to come and sell to us. Mr. MArtin.-I suppose you never ask any questions? WVitness.-Certanly not, if a respectable person; but if a stranger were to come to us we should make a great many inquiries, and if not sati.factory we should not pay for the goods but return them. Alderman BUsIPI'ssRY.-You. had better not go into the old question, for you are only making it more complicated. Mr. Lawson recalled, said,-Mr. W'Cullagh introdtced me to Taylor, and I wrote in reply to his of the 24th of Januasy, in which he offered to guarantee me the accounts at 4 per cent., to say that, as he knew the parties well he would sell to, I would take their bills without a guarautee. I did not agee to accept his guarantee at 4 per cent. i bad a check from Taylor for 76?. 12s. 6d., and I passed it into the Bank of London on the lth of last month, and it was psid before it was over. That was for gcods he had sold to Copeastake and Moore, for which he got the mney, aud he had therefore no right to send me this check. All the invoices were sent with the letters produced. The first accountsales, dated the 12th of October, were for 2781. 19s., and the terms being for two months' credit, the amount fell due on the 10th of Decemboer, and was paid. The next transaction was for 3841. in February. I saw Taylor for the first time on the 11th of April, and I told him it was a bad, un. fortunate Job, butfa I idnot~J I tel him ' tos] -hcau`dkerchiefs that were left in his warehouse to the amount of 1,000 dozen. I took them away, but there was no compli. ment in his allowing me to take away my own goods. Mr. Huddleston.-But they remained at his warehouse aftor you saw him until you sold them to Swallow ? Mr. Lawson.-Oh, yes. I sold them to Swallow, and the value of them was about 2001. The goods I sold on the 12th are the same that were sold to Meeking on the 13th of March. The invoices bear the same date. The invoice of the goods sold to Meeking on the 12th of February relates to the aame goods referred to in Taylor's invoice to me of the 14th of Feoruary, and those of the 13th and 16th of March are the same mentioned in Taylor's invoice to me of the 28th of March. Cross-examined by Mr. Huddleston.-The invoice price of the goods sold to Meeking varied from 2s. 4d. to 9s, 6d. per dozen. I do not know the average price of the 1,000. but it was altogether something over 2001. The discount I took off those goods was 25 per cent. Mr. Bairby recalled, said,-I am assistant to Mr. Taylor. I recollect L%wson's goods coming in and going to Meeking's, and, as far as I could tell, it was not poeible for Mr. Taylor to know they were going to Meeking's. If it had been known in the shop I must also have known it; but I did not know that such was the case until about five days ago, when I made inquiries of Fardell. I had no knowledge of it before. Cross-examined by Mr. Huddleston.-When these goods I were taken away from Taylor's -warehouse I thought they were going to May's, for I had had a conversation with May previously, which induced me to believe so. I had no reason whatever to believe the goods went elsewhere than to May's until I inquired of Fardell's foreman and obtained a list of May's transactions with Fardell, and found among them an account for the carriage of there goods to Meeking's. Mr. MD',Cllah recalled, said,-I wrote to Taylor thelette- prodaced, dated the 16th of Mareh, stating that I did n, ot see why he should take up Gorman's samples while he } ad Eome of mine always on hand; and Taylor's letter of the 18th of March is the answer to it.

The reason for paying the euaount in twoachepks was this:May owed an account for farniture, and the check for 241. 3s. 9d. was maade out to balance tbataccount and crossed to Jones Lloyd and Co., so that it aight be handed back tousbyMaymnpayment of thatMaccount.

M.Mra-That is the case for the prosecution, upon whic MI "ask y-ou, Sir, for a committal of these prisoners upon a charge of conspiracy to cheat and defraud the trade generally, and the prosecutors in particular. soAlderman HusprcEy.e The charge against the defendants is for conspiring together to defraud Mr. Gorman eyd Mr. Lawson of their goods. and a charge of this nature is very difficult to establish. It is only by a careful consideain of all the circumstances that it can be brought bhome to the Parties. However, it is not my Intention to go into all the minutte details which, from the unwillingness of witnesses, hvl o rendered ot case so complicated. I bave carefully considered all the circumstances as a perng the defendants individually, and as being conneceWd with each other, and my opinion in German's case is that All the defendants acted together in concert to get possession of the goodIs. May first, through Taylor, attempts to get the goods, hut upon Gorman refusin to seull to him Taylor writes to say Myers will huy them at the terms, 274 discounos and Gorman acceptsMyetrs as a purchaser, and accordingly sends the goods to Taylor, whmo, on the samo day that they arrive, delivers them to May, at thewareh,oue used by Myers and May. This was on Saturday, the 28th of March, andw on Monay. 'the 30to , May takes the goods to Air. Meeldnes and sells them at soimething like 50 per cent, under the ivoice price made out by Gorman. May receives the proceeds, and out of that very, money he pays Myers a sum he is indebted to him, but for what it does not appear, and he pays Taylor 1001., but Taylor does not send that amount to Gorman until he finds it ikely to be found out. I think the goods might have been sold at ahabtter price, but it does not appear that any attem-pt wag made by the defendant to sell them in any other market. As regards the character of May's conduct in this transaction it is so apparent that I need not dwell upon that Part Of the case. It is eqaally clear that Myers lends his name to Taylor, which enables him to get these goods, and that May was so connected with Myers and Taylor in business that it was next to imPossible for them not to know his transactions, or for any of them to be ignorant that these goods went to Meeling's. What then is Taylor's position? He writes on the 7th of April to say that May inxtercepted the goods; and onx the l1th he telns Gorman that May got the goods when he was out; and there is no doubt that Taylor knewv on the 7th of Aprilthat thegoods had gone to Meaking's, for he writes on that day to say that May had sold the goosa for Myers and Co., whereas Hairby, Tayloe's cofidential clerk, says that Taylhr did not know where the goods weot -until fve days ago, which is very imProbable. Mr. aairby.-I said that in reference to Lawsons goodr, not with regard to German's. Alderman ltYsmPHLstY.-.MTOW, if May reallY cdid intercept the goods it was a stealing beyond all doubt fixd if Myers and Taylor had entertained honourablel intentionspin thishmatter tuhy would have a p plied to a magistrate for a warrant to apprehend May uponr thatchbarge, and if May had been given into custody German would unquestionablyhave recovered his goods from Messrs. Meeking, who, as they had been stolen from Taylor, would have had to give them up-not that I presume Mr. Meekdng knew they had been stolen-stwe he would have had to maake restitution, if such a couxrs had been adopted. It is rather curious that the counsel for Taylore ndeavoured to cast the responsibility of this transaction upoRMyers, while the counse for the latter tried to fix Taylor with the criminal liability I but it is a melancholy fact, in mny opinion, that such fclte are affordled for dishonest traders in a large commercial city like London to obtain goods to such a large amount and sell them at so mucl below their value. And I think there is some want of due diligencefon the part of Mr. Meeking'f buyers in not makino more inquiry, for after the first transaction they must have had some idea that the goods could not have been honestly Come bucy tobesold attheprice btheywere. Under all the circumstanc-es, Ibthink it mywduty to sendthe case for,trial, whenTaylr an Myes 'sll hve a opprtuity of justify- igoothemselvesh, and I hBy tahey may aucq;uit themseve isno wheeys hof valjury.Therewasonlytheamounth Ofleach Mr. Pontifex.-In jnstice to Mr. Meeking, will you allow me to asl Mr. Morgan if he has not obtained every possible information that it was in Mr. Meeking' s power to afford him ? Alderman HlurPIREy.-But Mr. Meeeinghnotagie ainy information about his previous transactionswth Ma Mr. PontifeL-MrBa odkin on behaf of ar. infa ove you every transaction 'between Mr.spekifg and Alderman HumrpixnY.-Yes; hut it was only "To goods" so much, and "peY cash" so auch; but there is no information to.show whatkin3ds of goods they were, or what was the value. There was only the amuount Of eachi transaction. Mr. pontifex.-We were prepared to show the integrity of all our transactions, but you refused to hear us. Alderman VUaxpNHRBY.-BecaU50 you were not charged with any offence, and I did not wish you to imPicate Mr. Mceking. (Great sensation.) Mr. Pontsfex.-We offeredl you our books, and, in fact. anytbing you thought proper to ask for. If you had asked for a list of the transactions with May, specifying the invoice prices aund the prices paid for the goods, you could have had it. Aldlerman HcmLpmmyt.-Mr. Morgan has a very difficult case to get up, and perhaps you will furnish him with the account of those transactions of -which you gave me the list. Mr. Pontifex.-Ule shall have it, andl every information he may reguire. We are prepared to render every assisgt. ance in this prosecution, and have done so from the firat. Alderman llimcrExey.-Well, you will have an opportunity of proving that elsewhere. The prigoners were then cautioned in the ordinary form and com-mitted for trial, Taylor and Mlyers being balled in the same amount as before, and May, in default, con. veyed to Newgate. It was rumoured that Taylor's friends int2nd to rnove for a certicorari to remove the trial into the Courb of Queen's Bench.
HBE REMARRUIaE OF DIVOR CES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-If no one else will, I should like to protest, not against the infliction of punishment upon the gauilty, but against the infliction of a punishment that must plunge them still dceoper in guilt. The repudiated adulteress is not to marry her paramour. What, then, is she to do? Dtiven from her husband's roof, driven from her father's, in rnany cases 'ithout the necessaries of life, though accustomed to all its luxuries, and, however reduced she may be, too ignorant, too helpless and too infamous a creature to be able to earn her own living, what, I say, under these circumstances is she to do,-pine and wither in contempt and misery, without one tie to life, a half-starved beggar or at best a dependent on disgusted friends ? Will she so sO? Will the slave of vice as soon as she is divorced become a spotless nun, a more than Gnselda? Will she who has trampled on the most sacred laws submit to the merefiat of empiricism? Certainly not; she will think it no sin to become the mistress of her paramour, since the law wiU not let her be his wife, and she wiU both call and consider the union inarriage which would have been so but yesterday. Can you expect the recklessly licentious being that she mvst be all at once to become so nice and scrupulous, as not to do so? Her lover, however, will cease to look upon her as his wife when he is tired of her; he will hand her over to another, and what her last end will be it is distressing to contemplate. Recollect that when you forbid her to marry her paramour rou as good as forbid her to marry at all; and aslc yourself, iS it just and right to say to any one, " Do what you wiU, you cannot gratify your passions without sin?" Does it make it any way righter or juster that those appatites are violent in the extreme? It is trae that some one else besides her paramour may possibly marry the divorc6c; but who-who but an utter profligate or an utter fool, who when his passion for her cools will ill-treat her, scorn her, and make her utterly miserable ? Marriage, then, with her paramour is her only chance of recovering after her fearful fall. Do not, then, punish her by plunging her headlong down a still deeper abyss; do not make sin her last and only resource; do not deprive her of all hope, but give her one more chance of again regainig the paradise of a happy home by chastity, penitence, and goodness. She may only have slipped once. She masy have much to offer in excuse. Let the horrible doom Ihave depictedbe reserved for the worst class of adulteresses-thoso whose conduct has been so scandalous as to leavew them no hope of remar.rying. Iam, Sir, your obedient servant. A PHILANTHROPIST.
REF.,F-x,iTT ON OF LEEDS.-Out of respeet to the character and memory of Mr. R.

I THE CASUAr POOR OF THE CITY OF LONDON. Yesterday a deputation from the Board of Guardians of the West London Union, consisting of Mr. J. W. Butterworth (chairman of the Board), Mr. Harvey, Mr. Warre Mr. Bethel], and Mr. Spiller, waited upon the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house, when the first-named gentleman, addiessing his Lordship, said,-We are a deputation who have waited upon your Lordship in consequence of a unauimous vote of the Board to take your counsel upon a matter whish they feel to be of public importance, and to which you yourself, as a magistrate, have given very considerable attentiOn -namely, that of the casual poor of the city of London. It is their desire to make comnmon cause with yourself, and, if possible, to see that the arrangements for the reception and treatment of the casual poor of the city are put upon a better footing. We have as guardians read in the morning papers of your visits during the nights of the winter months to the various casual wards of the city and the houses Of refuge and hospices for the poor, whose only crime, if sucon a word could be applicable to their condition, is poverty. Your own benevolent exertions have led the guardians to look further into the question, and to look forward to you fyoni your high position as likely very influentialy to aid their object, and bring it in all probability to a successful issue. The following resolution was unanimously passed by the board on the 24th of March last:- "That it ic highly desirable some better arramgement hould be msde within the city of London for the recep*on of the casal or bouseless and vagrant pDor, and that if posible a central ward or wards should be provided Inthe city of London,tobe supported bytbhe seTeal uiions in oonnexion v,tth the city of London according to ttlir average oCome or expenditure or such ,ther contibutory atandarS of rateable proportiou as may apear to be equits,ie, and thit applicitiou be msae by thaeclerk to the other city unions to acceetai their T1ews on the subjcot." This resolution conveys to you our purpose. It is our desire to tnite with the other city unions to effect this common object, If we could meet upon common grounds under yoUr presidency, and unite in this common purpose. 'we feel that the ratepayers will not have to contribute unequally to the burden, but that the three city unions will pay pro ratO for such a desirable object. We have sent a copy of the resolution to the other city unions, and we now ask You to give Your sanction and approval to our proceedings. The plan of the guardians indicated ia this resolution has been very powerfully supported by the press. The leading organ of the day, Zhe TV= in particular, has ben pleased to adopt it, and to say that it considers it very feasible, and mighvt be carried out. As the guardians are bound by law to maintain the casual poor, so by the act of the 7th and SthVictoria, cap. 101, the Legislatureparticularly directed its attention to systematize thearrangements for the houselesspoor by providing asylums for them throughout London. At the time of the passing that Act great objection was made to it by some of the west-end unions, and it lies dormaut. We refer to that circumstance for the purpose of showing that the machinery, though dormant, is in existence for carrMing out this purpose so far as tho city is concerned. I have reason to suppose that you yourself are of opinion that the measure would not be good or complete unless the principle here suggested were applied to the whole of the metropolis. The. guardians feel that there would be diaiculty in the first instance in carrying oat the scheme in its integrity, and they feel that they can scarcely ask your Lordshiptohead amovementin amstter extessdingso much beyond your jurisdiction, but they feel at the same time that the measure is one which might be discussed under your presidency, and that come good miight result from it. The followging resolution wfas very recently;oassed at tiWe beard:- *, ThDat a commuittee be appointed to confer with the Lord Mayor sad the authorities ot the other twro City unious on the subject ot pineIlcally carryng out the resolution of this board, passed on the24th day of March last; having *or its object the providing ot a centra don, and copics of wbfch resoluatiton were' at the ltinRee fd rwrd toa the Lord bfaaer and the unionsreferted to." The committee therein referred to are the gentlemen, togetber with myself, who have the honour to attend here to-day. It becomes our duty to bring up to your Lordship an ofiiial copy of this resolution for your inspection, and we trust thatyou may be pleased to grant the desire of the guardians. We feel that in taldng this publio step we shall only have discharged our duty as guardians in considering the wants of the casual poor, for whom wo are bound by law to provide. Our casual wards, as at present situated, are Eome three miles from the centre of the metropolis, and that is the system which we wish if possible to alter. The LoRD MAYosM-The statement you have made, and the views expressed in the resolutions you have read, so thoroughly coincide with my own views that I Will say at once that I will afford you every assistance an my power for the purpose of enabling you to carry out so desirable an object. Nothing can be more unsaMtisfactory than the accommodation afforded to the casual poor of the city during the past winter, and of the evil consequences reslting from the prtsentsystem. r, with others, who have devoted much time and attention to the subject, have had ample means of judging from personal inspection of the receptacles provided for that unfortunate class of our fellow-subjects. If you will let me know what day will be convenient to you I will call a leeting of the guardians of each parish, and take their opinion upon the subject. I will most heartily join you in your efforts to alter and remedy the existing state of things The deputationthanked hisLordship fort the courtesy with which he had received them and withdrew.
THE CAFFBE QUESTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It has recently been officiaUy stated in the House of Commons that " it is no easv matter to decide what plan should be pursued for the defence and protection of the Cape." Many expedients have been tried, all hitherto without success. There is, however, one elan which I have recommended more than once, and which may perhaps at last be thought worth a trial; this plan is to plece the Dutch Boers between the eastern frontier and our old cattle-lifting acquaintances, the Caffres. Grant to the Boers the territory extending from the Keiskama to the Rye, on condition that they keep the Caffres out of our colonial settlements at the Cape of Good Hope. If the Boers accept these terms, rely upon it thee will be no more Caifre wars, at an average cost of 3,000,000l. sterling eaoh. Some personal Lnowledge of the subject, acjuired while on service in Caffreland, induces me to make this suggestion through the medium of your widely-extended Daner. l am. &C.. B. NATIER. Colonel.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIfES. Sir,-A letter signed by a Mr. Cliflord, who, I am told, is a news agent in the Temple, appears this day in your journal, wherein he complains of the trouble he has ncurred in explaining away the " fallacy of some ignorant naval authority" who lately signed himself " PostCaptain" in your columns, and who then had the presunption to maintain and, Imay say, still maintains) tha' the former's plan of lowering boats is mainly dependent on the rapid motion of the vessel at the time. Mr. (Aifford, moreover, seerms desirous of impressing on your readers the correctness of his nautical principle by the somewhat far-fetched simile, "if a man can jump oft a horse at full seeed, he can surely do the same when he is standing still I" Now, I am nnwiming to trespass on your columns with a controversy which would be uninteresting to nine-tenths of your readers ; moreover, a pamphlet being in the cours3 of publication hearing directly on the subject in general, it is nnecessaryto do so. In the meantime, if you are stil willing to attach any weight to the opinion of so "I ioorant a naval euthority" as theunderscribed, v ho in Mr. Cli£ora's opinion seems to have made but an indifferent use of his time afloat during the last quarter of a century, I must crave your indulgence to insert the following explanation. I cannot lay claim to any great experience in the mysteries of the circus or the f'ights of our acrobats, though I am naturally familiar, more or le33, with the great natural laws which govern their movements, and I must needs leave it to a landsman's ingenuity to trace their analogy with those which control the evolations of a ship at sea. It will, however, suit my purpose far better, and be generally better understood by your readers, if I extract a metaphor from MIr. Clifford's own pamphlet, wherein with great aptness he compares his principle of " lowering and disconnecting a boat" to a familiar toy-the humming-top. Now, it is a well-known fact that the latter can alone be disengaged for a boy's amusement by holding the hadle firmly in one hand, and at the same time pulling the strinR by a rapid motion of the other, whereby the end of the line becomes sooner unrove through the hole in the barreL It is hardly necessary to add, that without this rapid motion the top cannot be disengaged, but must remain in stctu quo. So it is with Mr. Clifford's plan,-eubetitute the boat for the hand in a state of rest, and the ship for the other, and the analogy is perfect as far as the self-disengaging properhes of the Weat are concerned. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant. A. POST CAPTAIN. aly LI.

SUNVDAY IN THE DLAK DISTArCT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The insertion of these lines in your colnmns will greatly aid the cause of humanity and practical godliness. i vonture, therefore, to ask that favour at your hands. Our season has justcommenced. The trains are already bringing early visitors. The well-known cries, " Grasmere, Rydal, Lowood, Bowness," are ringig more and more loudly at the railway terminus. Now, I am sure that those who visit this neighbourbood do not wish to purchase their pleasure at the cost of pain to others, much less at that of moral detriment. Wil you permit me, then, to inform them that during the season the persons connected with hotels and lodginghouses are not only deprived of the usual privileges of Sunday, but that that day is actually the most labonons day in the week? Late hours a-ad elaborate dinners are the principal causcs of this state of things. Indoor servants are exhausted with late and hurried bedmaldng, and the preparation of meals involving twice or thrse times the trouble of those on week days ; ostlers and drivers by "church jobs" and late Sstarday traveling. In short, Sunday is, X am assured by aU, not a day of comparative rest, but of excessive toil. What is the remedy ? It consists in the tourist's adopting the foliowing simple and easy rules sa L Rise earlier than usual on Sandays. 2. Do not hire aarria oa Sund y if it can posibly be helped. 3.

ST. PAUL'S SCHEOOL-That time-honoured ceremony, the " Apposition," took place yesterday afternoon in the spal0ous school-room of Dean Colet's deservedly famnous institution. The Apposition, like the Westminster Play, is one of the events of thp year, and apart from its own kclains upon the attention of the public-now, as ever, so generally interested in the cultivation of classical learning,-it is -eqully interesting to the Londoners as mere denizens of this smoke-dried metropolis from its asociation with the amusing diary of that prince of journal writers, the worthy Secretary Pepys, whose yearly peregrinations to St. Paul's School to do honour to the Apposition appear to have been most laudably constant. The Apposition of yesterday was not the least memorable of the very long series which it has been our good fortune to attend. It was honoured by the presence of at least half-a-dozen sight rev. prelates (including the Bishop of Chichester, the Bishop of St. David's, the Bishop of liandaff, the Bishop of St. Asaph,) and several notable public personages, among whom Mr. Gladstone, XP., and Mr. Adderley, M.P., were most conspicuous. Shortly after 2 o'clock the Rev. Dr. Kynaston, the exceUent Eigh Master of St. Paul's School, with hiq assistant masters, took his seat below the daYs, and the proceedings of the day commenced in due form with the recitation of a " Gratulatory Hymn" in commemoration of tho founder, Dean Colet, recited in Latin by the cantain of the school, MIr. T. N. MiUler, and in the English by Mr. P. E. Monkhouse. This "fHymn," of considerable length, was written in tho well-known trochaic pentadecasylabic metre now popularized by Tennyson's "Locksley HaUl" and other favourite modermlyrics. The first of three (Engliqh) poems on the subject of "The Convent of St. Catherine" in heroic verse, was also rocitod by Mr. Walter 4. Lawrance, the successful competitor for the "Milton Prize," founded by Sir C. M. Clarke, in the year 185L The prizes were then formally distributed by Dr. Kynaston in the followin& order-viz., the Governors' Prizes.-No. 1, Greek verse translation (Shakspeare, Mfacbeth, act iv., ac. 3), to Mr. Miller (captain of the school); and No. 2., the Latin hexameter translation (Pope, " Temple of Fame," 137-193), to Mr Whalley -the snglish esswy (awarded as a second prize in the Truro Prizo competition), to Messrs. Monk-hous and Whalley, aq. The Sleath Pri7e-`Latin essay (Sophocles, (Ed. Tyr., 873), to Mr. Mler. The Truro Prize ana Med,L-Englieh essay ("The Distinguishing Characteristics of Ancient and Modern Warfare"), to Mr. Lawrance. The Milton Prize.-English verse (" The Convent of St. Catherine), to Mr. Lawrance. The recitation of the " Gratulatory Hymns" and the one prize essay already mentioned, was, as usual, rather a tedious preliminary to the rest of the Apposition, and this custom might, perhaps, be more honoured in the breach than in tho observance. The essays themselves, as far as a very cursory perusal enablcs us to decide, are realy very creditble compositions, proving that Dr. Kynaston's high classc-.l scholarship has not been buried, like the treasure of the unprofitable servant, in the earth; but that, on the contrary, it has borne Rood fruit, or rather that It has been developed in most promising blossoms of future excelence in the shape of the maiden attempts of his pupils. The recited essays wero alU loudly applnauded. We subjoin a scheme of the speeches :-Plautus, Jlfies aEorios, act i, scene 1: Pyrgopolaices, Hand; Artotrogus, W. Monkhou,e. Beaumont and Fletcher, A King and no King, act iv, scene 3 : Bessus, Harris; First Swordsman, How; Second Swordsman' Whitle,. Horace, Sat., Lib. i, 9: Key. Aristophanes, Ranss, 775-1418: Euripides, Little;Dionysus, Whalley; fifschylus, Griffin Plato, Harris. Shakspeare, OtheUo, act iii, scene 3: Iago, Lawrance; Othello, Monkhouse. Molimre, ZAvarc, act I, scene 3, and act iii, scene 5, &c.: Harpagon, Butler; La Fldche, Sweeting; Valere, Whalley; Cl6ante, Whitley; Maitre Jacques, Brown. The speeches were, on the whole, very weeU delivered, and not a little genuine dramatic talent was evinced,-as, for example, by Mr. W. Monkhouse, in the scene from Plautus; by Mr. Whitley, as the second swordsman, in King and No King; and by all the performers iu the amusing excerpt from Aristophanes, whose exquisite Greek, so clearly and emphatically enunciated, was literally refreshing after the commonplace vernacular speeches of some of our publio orators, by coartesyso denominatedjlr.Monkhouse's (t izo was a careful and well-studied interpretation of the text of Shakspear ; but best ofalUwasthefineextractfromMolirea noble comedy, immortalized, as the habitsof the French Plays are weU aware, by the inimitable acting of IL Perlet. Mr. Butler's conception of Harpagon, the sordid creature who lives but on his ill-gotten gold, was far above the average of school-room exhibitions; and he was very ably seconded by Mr. Browne as " Maitre Jacques." The supperorderimg scene convulsed the audienoe with-laughter, andthe famons outcry "Au v'ulr' where the miser directly anostrophizes the audience, created a legitimate sensation. A. Dehlle, who officiated as prompter, is evidently (and with reason) proud of his pupils; and their examination papers, set by the official examiner, the Rev. Francois Martin (of the French Protestant Presbyterian Church of London), have been, we understand, very ably answere& At the conclusion of the speeches a large portion of theb audience, including a bevy of ladies uttircd in the gayest costumes of the spring, refreshed themselvesin Dr. Kynaston's well-stored library with chocolate and other beverazes interdicted by the Maine Liquor-law, and. assuredly sather different, both in colour and strengtha from those limpid waiers of Helicon with which the visitors of the day had been so largely and so liberally suppIked in tihe school-room adjacent.

THE LATZ ZORD TZjVTBRDBV. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As a humble day-worker amid the dust of tih, Forum, permit me to call your attention to the manner im which Providence, according _to Lord Campbell, is Sup posed to reward sach toiL The learned Chief Jastice has just published a volume containing the lives of three Chief Justices-Kenyon, EBllenbbrough, Tenterden. I was somewhat puzzled, towards the conclusion of this work, to understand the meaning of the Latin epitaph which Lord Campbell gives us as the one which marks the sp6bt where Lord TentordenWs honoured remains have been depoeited. We are therein informed-after the usual reciAls -that the great judge in question, Per anos i n cI auyeeastu,' and then, what ? There immediately follows an almonition to the reader, which, thus plaoed, becomes ludicrous in the extreme.- Quantum apud Britaunos Boueatuk Iabor ravente Deo Valeat Agnowm Lector. Now, Sir, with every disposition to acknowledge that ill one sense honest labour is its own reward, it surely is a, somewhat xtrange notion to introduce Providence as recomipensing toil by toll itself. Suppose, now, an epitaph upomL Lord Campbell-far, far distant be the day when it is. needed !-to run thus:- "Near this spot we deposited the remains of JO' LOAD) CANPLELL, who worked at law for half a century like a horze, and wrote the live3 of the Lord Cbanceflor4 and the Lives of thebief Justicea. What return among Britons boneut labour bIngs Acknowledge, 0 Reader PI Surely, Sir, this would be unsatisfactory. I may say formyself that after 10 years of dradgery, Ido not feel at all disposed to call an assembly of admiring Britons around nie,. and with a pious ejaculation or two to invite them inmy person to consider what rewards attend upon honest laboar in this favoured country. The' feelng, I shouald say, is. somewhat general in the profession. The notion struck meas so whimsical-so completely fulfilling my idea of a bad. joke cut in marble-that I had the curiosity to procure a. copy of the actnal inscription on the mural tablet which marks the place of Lord Tenterden's sepulture. The reas epitaph runs thus:- " Props 8ituaR2st Carolus Baro Teotaden Doanna et Alicia, Abbott PFliu inta minor HumiUmiiu iortts PArentibus Patre vero .rudenti, Matre pi ortus echolt Regla Cantuarieuoss Postoa Collegil Corpori ahristl Alumnus Per Annom XX2 In Cwub verstta tPrinio ad oummua madcita Mox sad Placita coram lpso Repe Teuenda Jnatioiastua Delude Jusucaria Caltaia Gratit demum Gectgil IV. Reg1 In Baronum ordinemeoDoptatua) Quantum apud srltannos Honeatus Labor Favente Do Valeat ,ignos3 Lectoc". Surely, Sir, sach an omission as this is caryng&the principle o condensation to extremes. I have mked as a. parenthesis the pasesge suppressed by Lord. Campbell. There may be some among your readers who.may be interested by a rectification of the error. I am, Sir, your obedient servanL, A ISARKWTh.

ZO&DON, THUMSDAY, MAY 28, 1857. What in an excuse for the past ought also to be a -wariing for the future. Time after time the nation has been told that the delays, the difficulties, and the enormous expense,--aomeewhere about a hundred millio-nof the late war were owinpto our ut*er want of. prepaation. This, in it3 turn, w&3 thrown upon the stinginess of the House of Commol0s, which did not like large establishinents or an experimental expenditure. Then, it was said, ! the jealousy of that House and its continual craving for returns had led to a pen, ink, and paper system; though this evil was not of so recent a date, considering that the DuxE himself used to complain that many years after the Peninsular War he found himself called on to pay bills for stores issued, but not accounted for. In our own opinion, as we stated during the war and before it, the House of Commons was never backward to vote money when a good reason could be shown for it. What it justly objected to was that spontaneous, indolent, unprofitable growth, to which public as wel as private establishments are all liable, and which they wiU as certainly undergo if they are not properly checked. The nlmber of three-deokers built only to rot during the 40 years' peace, the number of regiments kept up only to do police duty, the number of stores purchased to be sold again at a tenth of their cost, and the number of colonels and admirals on our books, necessary or not, bore witness at least to the generous patriotism of the House of Commons. It was not to blame that the war foumd us unprepared. Nor is it the fault of that body now if we are not taking the proper steps towards greater efficiency, readiness, and, if we may so express it, versatility of resources. It would indeed be a strange stigma to England if a bedy which on the average receives " new " blood," as it is caUed, every four years, in the shape of 200 new members, the very pick of their country, should be chiefly characterized by a grovelling, suspicious, mercantile spirit, caring more for a few hundred thousands than for the success and honour of our arms. The fault is not in that body, thus continually and plentifully refreshed from the nobility and wealth, from the enterprise and ardour, the genius and virtue, of our race. The fault is rather in the heart of the establishments themselves, in which every man of enthusiasm and genius tells you that routine, seniority, and private interest are everything; and in which you are told every day that there is no escape from waste but by excessive exactness, none from injustice but by the most levelling rules, none from an invasion of vulgarity and turbulence but by aristocratic influence and official dexterity. No doubt, it may seem hard, though natural enough, to spare the legislator at the expense of the functionary-the Parliamentary at the expense of the official Englishman. The one is only an inexperienced and irresponsible adviser-the other a practised and accountable officer. This may serve to show that the House of Commons is liable to error; but, while that House comes straight from the heart of the people, and not the least from the higher classes and higher feelings of the people, its fault will not be stupid jealousy or shortsighted economy. At any time, whatever, Government has only to prove a thing to be required, either for present use, for future security, or for the improvement of the public service, and it is immeediately granted. On these points the shortcoming is much more in those who may reasonably ask than in those who should dutifully and freely comply. For this purpose we will take a few simple and natural suppositions, which will answer a double purpose. Suppose that instead of Lord PA.r.aRSTON'S speeCh on moving the Army Estimates containing scarce a syllable about China, and Sir CQU:ES WOOD having also scarcely mentioned that region, except incidentally while replying to some remarks on the casualties of his department, both these Ministers had described an amount of preparation somewhat in advance of the publie intelligence, and had also boldly asked for aid towards certain improvements, or even novelties, found advisable for this particular object. Suppose that Sir CRAZxS WOOD, besides explaining, to our comfort, that the hundred new gunboats and small craft constructed for the late war anad never used, having been adapted especially for the Black Sea, were unfit for the tropics, or even China, had asked for a grant towards the construction of twenty new craft, of some sort or other, that would enable us to follow up a Chinese junk wherever it might skulk. Sir C. NAr-m observes that where one man can go another can follow, and by parity of reason where one armed ship can go another can, if we only suppose it properly constructed for the purpose. Passing, then, to the other department,-suppose Lord PAsLSToN,besides noticing, as he did, that the campaign in the Crimea was a very peculiar one-indeed, hardly a campaign in the marching, moving, and manceuvring sense of the word-had further observed that in China our troops might possibly have to march into the interior under a hot sun and in strange circumstances, and that there would be need of lighter clothing and accoutrements, some new description of tents, or certain other expedients suggested by our Indian experience. Suppose that on these points he had noticed the particular anxiety under which poor General STA ^ji's spirit is said to have sunk, and had cited the authority of the ill-used General AsiaBUupNHAM, said to have distinguished bimself by the care he took of his men in unhealthy situations. Take all these suppositions, and would the House of Commons have looked coldly on either of them, shrugged, shaken their heads, counted up the sum total, and ended by telling the two MIinisters, one after another, that they must do with what they had, fortheycould have no more money ? We do not think they would. At all events, the experiment has never been tried. Government has not thrown upon the House the responsibility of stinting and spoiling our preparations for China. So, if these preparations be ever found stinted and spoilt, we hope the blame will rest in the proper quarter. We have ever held this language ourselves, and our worst enemies cannot tax us with advocating a slavish economy whenever the interests and honour of the country were immediately concerned. It is only ne w exendis o res y d i nt om r t a only a new discovery in some quarters that the people of England and the men whom that people send to represent them at Westminster are not stupidly parsimonious. For the first timo in our history it has been observed, so we read, that "war and waste have been "popular cries." That is not exactly a fair account of the matter; it is only true so far as that the people of England know there is a time for all things,-a time for spending money as well as for saving it. But there is all the difference in the world between an expenditure which addresses itself to the feelings and the reason of the people, which is directed to an object which we may happen to have at heart, and one which seems the mere growth of time,-a self-existihg and increa3ing evil, a canker of the State, an incubus on the national industry. Talk to ordinary IEnglishmen-and most members of Parliament, happily for England, are ordinary Englishmen. about our splendid military and naval establish- ments, about the enormous number, tonnage, and horse-power of our navy; about our irnpregnable naval depots and harbours of refuge ; about our immense stores, and the perfect condition of our army,-and they listen as coldly and suspiciously to the grand enumeration as they would to an aniique catalogue or the items of a tradesman's bill. It is a trial to their patriotism and their faith, and they bear it with tolerable patience. Far otherwise is it when they have themselves sanctioned and even preacribed the object, and when to that object the expenditure' is expressly directed. *Ior is this merely the levity of a rude people, excited by novelties and engrossed with a near object. All experience shows that war is an experimental, Or what is caled a tentative art; and that we shall contfibute much more by giving our whole strength and taxing our whole ingenuity in bringing the present war, whatever it is, to a successful and early result, than by sticking to some grand routine of naval and military development. It is an affair in which we ought to press what is urgent, oven at the cost of some delay in what may be done equally well next year, or any time the next twenty yeara. We know not when we shall ever want our army and navy for any other purpose, but we want them as soon as possible to settle imatters with China.
We have just received Sir RcHAnD Bzmxrgs Bill for the Punishment of Fraud committed by Trustees, Bankers, and other persons intrusted with property. The Bill is, happily, short and intelligible, qualities which do not always distinguish this class of literature. We find in it seven short sections, in which the offences to be henceforth brought under the cognizance of the Criminal Courts are pointed out and defined. The first is aimed at the class of " trustees ;"-how many among us in decent. positions in life have the good fortune to be neither trustees nor executors e Now, trustees are, for the most part, at the mercy of the solicitors to the trust funds, unless they be very careful men indeed, and do not shrink from causing trouble and expense. Some of this class will upon the slightest provocation throw the affair into Chancery, and thus relieve themselves from responsibility at the expense of the estate. With the terror of the ATTronNy-Gssm2's penal clause before their eyes we suspect that this class of over-careful trustees-and executors too-will receive a large addition. For the future, trustees who, " in violation of good faith, and with intent " to defraud," appropriate trust money or any part of it to their own use are to be held guity of a misdemeanour, punishable by penal servitude for any terma not exceeding seven years. The only check upon this Draconic clause, which would otherwise render men as unwilling to meddle with the office of trustee as with red-hot iron, is a provWion in the 12th section. No such prosecution is to be commenced without the sanction of some Judge or of the ATToRNy-GENERAL, and it is supposed that in this way vexatious and unjustifiable indictments may be avoided. " Good faith " and " fraudulent intent" are very plastic terms; so it is to be hoped the security implied by the necessity of obtaining this previous sanction may avail. It is, no doubt, highly expedient to frame some such clause as this for the benefit of persons interested in trust funds, for few persons, if they be not members of the legal profession, can have the faintest idea of the amount of iniquity annually perpetrated by trustees. Any lawyer who has seen much of business will invariably advise his client not upon any consideration to leave his affairs in the hands of a sole trustes. Trustees must be posted, like sentries in the presence of an enemy, in pairs, the one to be sentry or trustee over the other. Were it your own brother, were it a man you have saved from drowning, were it the clergyman of your parish, never make him "sole" trustee. At the same time, the office is one which must be filled. Were the law made so stringent that private individuals were altogether frightened away from the office of trustee, the only alternative would be an indefinite extension of the powers of the Court of Chancery. Trusts must be. A cestui-que trust would be made a ward of Chancery, as minors are now, under certain conditions. Now, this would Le a great evil, and therefore the honest trustee must be protected in the discharge of his duties, and even cases of dubious malversation must not be scanned with too severe an eye. We will not say the securityis inadequate. A Judge or theATTonNEyGmENmu will surely be slow to allow a prosecution save upon very clear evidence indeed. It would be difficult to imagine any case for legislation, wherein the interference of the Legislature is imperatively called for, more surrounded with diffi. culties than the one before us. On the one hand we have rascality and malversation in office, on the other the danger that the most honourable men will shrink from the discharge of duties which may involve them in such terrible consequences. Something must be tried, and here is a definite proposition. Time only will show whether it will work all the good we desire, and not the evil which we apprehend. The second. third, and fourth sections reenact in more general terms the provisions of the 7th and 8th GEORGE IV., cap. 29, sec. 49. Under this Act it was provided that bankers, merchants, brokers, or other agents intrusted with money, or securities for the payment of money, with " directions in " writing" as to the applicationof the same, and who should convert them to their own use, should be held guilty of a misdemeanour. Further, where any valuable security or power of attorney for the sale or transfer of any shares in the public funds, &c., was intrusted to any banker, broker, merchant, attorney, or other agent, and such person, in violation of the purpose for which the security or power of attorney was transferred to him, sold, negotiated, transferred, or pledged the security or the proceeds for his own benefit, he was also guilty of a misdemeanour. Such is a general outline of the enactment which will be now virtually superseded by the more general terms of Sir RICHARD BETEELWS new Bill. The second section provides,-" That any banker, merchant, "broker, attorney, or agent, being intrusted "as such with the property of any other " person, and who shall, in violation of "good faith, and with intent to defraud, sell, "negotiate, transfer, pledge, or in any manner "convert or employ to or for his own use such "property, or any part thereof, shaU be guilty of "a misdemeanour.' It would be difficult to have an enactment more sweeping, or one, we believe, more imperatively calUed for by the circumstances of the time. The form of crime charged is sirmply a theft of the most barefaced kind, with breach of trust superadded. It is a crime perpetrated not by ignorant men, but by persons of unusual professional Skill. They have sought the employment under which their iniquities are perpetrated-it has not been thrust upon them. In fact, there is not the shadow of an excuse, not the faintest palliation, to be urged in their behalf. In the third section the same penalty is fulminated agaiunst aany person " who, being intrusted with any power of attorney for the sale or "transfer of any property, shall fraudulently sell, "transfer, and convert such property, or any "part thereof, to his own use." The general tenour of the remarks which we have offered upon the preceding section will apply to this one also. By the fourth the security to society is rendered more complete. Thereby "bailees" of any property who fraudulently convert it to their own use are equally guilty of a misdemeanour. It may be unnecessary to add that this last provision has a far wider scope than the case of the mere banker or broker, and is intended to cure a defect in the criminal law, by which the practitioner was constantly headed back, and the guilty escaped punishment. No onO who has read the unhappy and disgraceful chrouicles of commercial misconduct during the last few years will hesitate for a moment to acknowledge that uithout such provisions as these the business of this country could no longer be carried on with credit and security. So vast is the extenion of our commerce, sogreat the temptation to unprincipled men to embark in wild speculations at the expense of their clients, so numerous the instances of triumphant fraud of this description, as to inspire-dismay among fair traders and the honest portion of the com3imnity. When we consider, moreover, how frequently persons in every way deserving of comsmiseration are the dupes of these reckless Iharpers, there will be nothing wanting to complete the indignation of any man of ordinary probity and good faith. Let us think for a moment on the class of persons who were ruined by such a failure as that of STRAiLN and P.&an. The customers of the house were not persons engaged professionally in mercantile pursuits, and therefore pretumably upon their guard, but private gentlemen who had a full right to rely upon the integrity of their bankers, ladies naturally ignorant of business, aye, and the poor governess, who, in one moment of time, found herself despoiled of the hard-won earnings of her life. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth sections of Sir BIOHAuD Bnrurar's Act are pointed expressly at the directors or public officers of bodies corporate or public companies. The notorious defects of the criminal law with reference to such persons have at last compeled an enactment which does not appear to err on the side of overleniency. Henceforth it will be a misdemeanour in any such person to take " fraudulently" for his own use any of the property of the company. This, we presume, provides for the case of the deposit of sham securities. It will be a misdemeanour in a director, &o., to posss himself of any of the money belonging to the companyotherwise than in payment of a just debt-if he wilfully omit to make an entry of the transaction in the books of the company. It will be a misdemeanour in any such person to destroy, alter, or falsify any of the company's books; to be privy to the makiDng of any fraudulent entry, or to any fraudulent omission. It will be a misdemeanour in any director, &-c., to circulateQ or to join in circulating, any false statement as to the circamstances of the company with the intention of deceiving any member, shareholder, or creditor of the company, or with the intention of inducing any person to become a shareholder or partner in the concern, or to trust his money to the custody of the company, or to enter into any security for the company's benefit. Sir RIcGm) BEZmmL seems to have studied the pathology of the Royal British Bank with sound effect, for the provisions of his Act just appear calculated to meet the evils brought to light when the transactions of that impure concern were under judicial consideration. Such, then, is the beginning of a new era in our criminal legislation. Henceforward we may take it as a principle that commercial fraud is no longer to escape unpunished. Year after year the net will be drawn tighter around the limbs of our commercial swindlers. We do not altogether despair of seeing our commercial code in such a state as will really terrify the rogues out of their malpracices, and drive them upon honesty, as the more promising speculation.
We shall have no difficulty, we are sure, in securing the attention of the public to a question concerning the freedom, not exactly of trade, but of education, in this country. For fear, however, our readers should take alarm even at the bare proposition of such a subject, we will at once explain the case to which we are alluding. Not long ago we gave our readers a general outline of that very able Report upon Military Education to which Iord PA?Muau referred on Friday last, and which, though prepared with a special view to the Scientific Corps of the Army, embraces, in fact, the whole field of instruction in this department. Now, in this Report it is inquired whether the schools of this country, public or private, large or small, are, or are likely to be, capable of communicating such an education to students as will supersede the necessity of maintaining special Mlitary Colleges for the purpose. In other words, the question amounts to this,-whether private enterprise can be relied upon in this particular respect to provide a supply for a demand, or whether it is advisable to regard the case as an exceptional one, and establish some specific machinery for meeting it. When we add that the Commissioners decide the point against the scholastic profession of the country, we shall have said quite enough, we know, to put some thousands of clever minds upon the alert. In proceeding to explain and consider the reasons by which the Commissioners have been governed in arriving at this conclusion, we feel inclined to discard without much hesitation one argument to which they attach apparently a material importance. " The practice," they say, "of all foreign countries that we have visited, "uwiu exception, is against the opinion "that it is possible to supersede the teach"ing of Military Academies." The countries referred to, as the reader may perhaps recollect, are France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia. Now, we are in no degree surprised to learn the concurrence of such authorities in this particular, but we cannot admit the application of the fact to the case before us. The policy of the continental States tends systematically, not only in this respect but in almost all others, to bring the institutions of the country under the direction or control of the Government, aud it was not, of course, to be anticipated that an intervention applied to so many of the ordinary transactions of a people's life would be withheld in so special a case as that of the education of the army. But with ourselves the position of affairs is altogether different. Here private enterprise is the rule, and Government undertaking the exception. The spirit of our institutions tends always to the preference of private agency, wherever it is available, to the action of the State; and in recent discussions we have heard objections strongly advanced against what was thought a growing tendency to saddle the State with the direct charge of matters heretofore remitted to local or individual administration. No doubt, the continental system has its own advantages; we saw as much in the case of railways ; but it is not our system, nor do we think the argument drawn from it will possess much force, unless supported by distinct considerations. It must be understood that the particular description of education to which we are referring is that which would intervene between the ordinary liberal instruction given at a respectable school and the purely practical training which the actual work of the army would of course require. Nobody denies that a boy should be first well taught in the general branches of civil educationnobody denies that at last, and before being fit for service, the officer must go through a course of drill more or less special. The question is, vhether the instruction required between these two periods-that is to say, instruction directed especially towards the profession of arms, but not involving actual military training, can be supplied by the seminaries or tutors obtainable in open market, or whether provision must be made expressly for the purpose. To facilitate the comprehension of the case we may observe, that the subjects of this course of study would include not only modem languages and English and general history, but mathematics, to a greater extent than usually pursued, and, above al, militay history, statistics, and topography. Now, the Commissioners remark, that not even in the firat-mentioned of these subjects are the attainments acquired under e isting arrangements of such a standard as is desirable, wbile a regards the latter and more special. depart. ments they state in a separate portion of their Report that scarcely any textboo exist in our language, aud they even sugest that " the "Government might advantageously set on foot at "once some works of this kind, great care being "taken to place the preparation of them in the " ablesthands." It is obviou5showever thatthisaeE- I ciency would be felt as much in a Military CoUege as in a private school, and, though schools may not p produce satisfactory results at present, the fact is not conclusive of what they might perforam in the way of supply when a demand not hitherto experienced should become fairly established. At the same time, we concur in the belief of the Commissioners that it would not be found possible (as it would certainly not be advisable) to supersede classics by any of these new studies, and in their opinion that no study which is not the favourite study of the school will ever have a good chance. These points being disposed of, it is argued that such subjects as military scientific history, topography, and statistics, would require eminently practical teachers and the employment of considerable funds, whereas if the number of young men annually entering the army, together with the scale of expenses desirable in such cases, is taken into consideration, no prospect of adequate returns would be discovered. We must confess that, although we should not have been convinced on all the other points discussed, we are compelled to regard this last argument as decisive. In our judgment there would not really be found any difficulty, after a short time, in supplying whatever instruction was wanted by purely private enterprise, provided only the demand were sufficient to remunerate the efforts required. In the same way, as regards military literature, we have not the least doubt that books would be produced if there were the certainty of a ready sale ; in fact, we have recently noticed some meritorious productions of this description. Guarantee the Customers, and all the rest may be left to Paternoster-row. The talent and energy enlisted in the scholastic profession of this country are fully competent to the provision of any kind of instruction that could be required, and if a knowledge of Chinese or Cireassian would insure young men a good maintenance, in a few years' time we should have as many Chinese and Cireasaian scholars as we now have attorneys and engineers. It is clear, however, that it would answer nogood purpose eitherwith pupils or teachers to disturb the recognized framework of ordinary eaucation for the sake of a special class of students, who would be so few in number as to be altogether lost if distributed over the mass. Here lies the turning point of the question-not in the difficulty of the supply, but in the partial character of the demand. Advertise to-morrow that any known science or language would, if correctly taught, secure any school or tutor an accession of remunerative business, and you will have it taught instantly with all the excellence admitted by the case. When, however, the demaud is not of a nature to be thus remunerative, but is, nevertheless, based upon requirements of the State, it is time to look to special provision, and we hope that in this, as well as other respects, the reorganization of our military education, so ably discused by the Commimsioners, may receive the attention which such a subject deserves.

LVEmRPoOL.- LIVERPOOL, May 27.-The water now supplied to Liverpool from the Rivinkton-hills, though abundant in quantity, is not of that quality which would render it generally acceptable for dietetic purposes. This is owing to the fact that the large body of water, when impounded, rests upon peaty ground, and to the equally important fact that the system of ffiltration is not suficient to prevent all vegetable impurities from passing into the service pipes. At a meeting of the Town-council to-day a resolution was adopted to the effect that the water in its present state is not fit for dietetic purposes, and that the principle of filtration by gravel beds before the water enters into the service pipes be taken into the earnest consideration of the oommittee, who are to report to the council at the August meeting.

For 24 houn trade business are as things of no icoounit. The "odds" and turf. "- have' auceeed.: ivoices and bank accounts, and all give themselvos up to the enjoyment of the great holyday wi2ih a relish and excitement tht iuspires the moot blase' and rouse the most phlegmatic. It isveyr well to say that it is our natioal tate for horIwracing which blackens the Downison these ocmosalosi but we have our doubts of the correctness of the assertion. What would the race be without the road to it, the people, the little pleasure partieq, and the not little hampers? The Derby dayi, in lact, the metropolitau pie nic. It is looked forwvar to as xuch,andthedust,hury, confusion,tepidcharAp.gtne, and gritty fowls are so many necessary adjuncts to the great day out. Take away any of these access sories, and the Derby day would be as tedious as A debate on Maynooth. The roads yesterday were as the roads can only be on these occasions. There was, of course, no lack of equipages, of all kinds-splendid, moderate, decent, and used up,and the usual per centage of animals that would not go with others that couldn't, and never should have been tried at all. What a marvellous resurrection of horseflesh always takes place on the Derby dar Like the bony villains that can only be asseutblIw by a public execution, so also are the ricketty quadrupeds on the road to Epsom to be een at no other time or place. Where ae they kept tiU the great day calls upon them bto exhibit a feeble motion and make believe as if they were going tP run? What becomes of them aU when the dy is past? Every variety oftheseunfortunatequadrupeds was outyesterday. Somehadabout as much chanco of reaching' the Downs as Stonehenge, and human credulity was exhibited in its moet aggravated form. amog the parties who sat behind such beasts, evidently under the notion that they would take them to Epsom. Other horses there were of a more deceitful character, whose performances it was evident would terminate at the Downs and reduce the yonthful clerks in blue veils to the unpleasant necessity of pssing the night in the carriage or dragging it b=ck to town themselves. But these were by no means the worst among the various specimens of horseflesh. There were many "c py" animals. The celebrated predicament of DE. Briggs in a bathing-machine behind a jibbing horse, and the tide coming in, was quite outdone by the vagabond eccentricities of some animals, which, without warning, backed full into the stream of vehicles with awful havoc. The steep hill leading up to the course afforded peculiar opportunities for such displays; on arriving at this the general opinion among the horses seemed to be that they had done quite enough, and those that had been lively en retes "let out" as if they meant to kick the driver from his seat. Much amusement was cteated here by a panic which ensued among the occupants of a first-class drag, who all, even to the driver, sprang into the road on a alight hostile demonstration of one of their leaders. The consequences might have been serious but that a bystander, with much courage, cllung to the head of the refractory brute, and, amid the din of a thousand infallible remedies for a vicious horse, contented himself with the best and simplest-that of holding him fast. There were the usual number of breaks-down on tbe road, some of which seemed quite inexplicable. Carts that looked as if they could not be reliedupon I to go a mile jogged on securely with six or seven inside and a small party on the shafts, while apparently sound vehicles came to grief with such astonishing facility as to lead to a general suspicion that they must have been manufactured at some Covern3ment establishment. Animmense number of visitors came down perrail-not less thanbetween 16,000 and 17,000. The arrangements at the London-bridge station on this occasion were very good. No stoppages took place. Extra ticket clerks were provided, and as fast as the people streamed in they took their places in the train, and were despatched in batches of 500 and 600 at a time. Asfaras could be judged by a brief visit to the station, there was no cause of complaint, and we doubt if ever so large a number of passengers were conveyed with less trouble in as short a space of time. After passing Cheam the visitor by rail caught glimpses of the road, marked by a dense ridge of dust of such consistency that it seemed hard to believe that it would ever disperse again, but remain evermore a permanent feature of the landscape. In fact, each cortege, high or low, seemed attended by a small Simoom which hung upon all its movements with suffocating pertinacitv, and coated features and dresses in a way that made recognition difficult in the extreme. It would be a nice calculation if it were possible to ascertain the precise number of luncheons lost through friends being thus disguised in gritty partiles. From the towrn of Epsom the stream of foot passengers wasinesasant, pouring up towards the course in dense black lines till they merged into the great sea of human beings, which seemed to fret and surge in heavy masses between the stand and startingpost. Epsoam Racecourse on a Derby day, as our readers are aware, is a phenomenon quite indescribable. It is a medley,-a world on a small sale, such as the Derby only exhibits, for only London could. furnish it. No other festival in the world approaches near to it. It is, in fact, a houseless London,-London with all ite pomp, wealth, and squalor, wants, vices, luxuries, gentlemen, knaves, and fools, at once transported as if by magic to the open fields. Like all great sights, it leaves a strong though indistinct impression on the mind, whimsical and bizarre, like the aspect of the course itself, where much is seen and little recollected. Who that sawr a Derby once can ever forget it; yet who that has seen it 50 times can tell more than that it is an immense assemblage, as undefinable as the ocean ? Yesterday it difrered little from its usual cosmopolitan aspect. There were tents and booths of all kinds, from the palatial canvass of Al,g down to the miserable tarpaulin shanties on twig from out of which the salow daughters of Egypt dispensed unheard-of wealth in sixopenny fortunes. There were organ grinders, mounteboanks, dancers, fiddlers, and beggars,_performing monkeys, and precocious, children. Tenlder infants that could scarcely stand upon their feet were made to stand upon their heads in wooden platters, and urchins, scarce weaned, crept up long ladders carefully adjusted on the parental noste which bore evident tokens of having suffered somewhat in the unu*ual duties it was caUled upon to fulf1. Sallow vagabonds in much-used 'fleehine". contorted themselves after a manner that quite upset all theorie. as. to the ue of a back-bone. runches, girls on s.tilts, ballad singers, negro mnelodlsts grinning from ear to ear, card-a.harpers, and the never-to-b sufficiently anathematized " lkerrekt cards" abounded as usual. Piokpockets, of course, mustered strong, and must have reaped a bounteous 'arvest, for until it was time to clear the course but fea policemen were to be seen. In this part of the arrangements an alteration is dcidedly needed. The Grand Stand was very full, and visitors continued to arrive up to the very 3momnent of the horses starting. As usuAl,- there were some 20 or 30 belated parties that misse the whole afihair, coming only in time to ahare the dust and general panicand disappointment that ensued on the winner's number going up at the post. The first race generally commands about as much atteti- tion as the first piece of a boxing night. Yes. teiday there was not even a m3sgivMina as to the state of the turf to give it interest, and all the varied noises of a raoe. course continued with almost unabated vigour.

OUR RELATIONrS WJTH BRAZIL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-When I addressed you on the subject of the African lave trade with Brazil I was not aware that Mr. Roebuck had given notice for Thursday next of a motion for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the state of our general relations with that empire. I orave your permission to say 3 few words on those relations. It was somewhat owing to British mediation that Dom John of Portugal acknowledged de jure the independence of Brazil, which was indisputable defacto. The terms which Sir Charles Stuart procured from Dom Pedro for his father were very advantageous to Portugal and very unjust towards Brazil, for by the treaty of 1825 BrazU was made publicly to assume a debt of 1,300,000. vwhich Portugalhad raised to enable it to assert Brazilian independence, and secretly to pay to the Portuguese Court 600,OOOl. Brazil had in addition raised foreign loans of its own in the cause of its independence. These debts pressed heavily on the resources of a yoUng, half-organized, distracted country, somewhat intoxicated with its own success, and ruled by a Mlonarch whose misfortune it was never to be able to keep aloof from European politics and to concentrate his facul. ties and affections on Brazil. But this was not the only mistake made by British diplomsoy. Having procured these excellent terms for Dom John and Portugal at the expense of Brazilian finance, we next attended to our own interests at their expense also, and in the follovwing year obtained from Brazil n Croaty, whereby Brazil undertook notto imposehigherrates of duty on British importations than 15 nbr cont. adovcloasrn. That which Brazil granted to Eogl- as obliged also, for the prevention of smuggling, to grb..kt to all other coumtries. Thus England, out of regard for its own interests, limited the Brazilian tariff of import duties to 15 per cent. ad valorem. In a country like Brazil the main source of revenue was, and is, and must for a long time be, Customs' duties. By the favour, therefore, which Brazil was made to grant Eng. land a serious restriction was placed on her revenue. The consequence was that to maintain her credit, to carry en her government, and to preserve public tranquillity, Brazil had to make considerable additions to her foreign loans, had to create a large domestic debt, and, far worse, had to depreciate her currency. Although England got terms like these for her own commerce daring the whole period of the currency of the treaty of 1826, England by high duties rigorously excluded from consumption the staple articles of Brazilian production. The mediation of England in favour of Brazilian inde. pendence proved, then, a very costly intervention for Brazil, Brazil terminated. as she had the right to do, the treaty of commerce with England in 1844, and her treaties with other States ceased at the same time. Brazil immediately regulated her Castoms'tariff by her own financial necesdties, and not by her aUies' interests. The result of the change has been a gradual increase of revenue, the conversion of a heavy defict into a large surplus, and a complete reformation in the administration of the empire. Now Brazil begins seriously to think of again reducing her Customs' duties. In such a reduction British trade is deeply interested that it shall be placed on the same footing as the commerce of other foreign nations with Brazil. England has not, however, any iaost favoured nation stipulation from Brazil tu secure such equality of treatment. In regulating her tariff Brazil has simply her own interests to consult, Hitherto her tariff has been based on sound economical pri.ci pes ; but Brazil has at present strong temptations to try the effect of another policy in her relations with Englanid. The United States, for example, are the best customers Brazil has. They consume by far the greater part of her m.ost profitable produce-coffee i by the last alteration of their tariff every article of Brazihan produce, except sugar, is adu,ittej into the United States free of duty, and the balance or trade with the United States is in favour of Brazil to the extent of more than 2,000,0001 a-year. I need not sav that in slavery there is identity of institutions and interests between the United States and Brazil, or point out the jealousy of England in relation to Brazil Ii lich arises thereout. The ULited States seek for commercial advantages in Brazil cour e,ponding to the advantages they give Brazil in their own markets. There is a party in Brazil who earnestly desire more intimate relationsx with the United States, and wtiose flag is, " a political and commercial alliance withthat country." Under the operation of a new electoral law which came into force a few months ago, and according to which the Chamiber of Deputies has been chosen, there is reason .o believe that this party has increased in strength in the Brazilian Legislature. Here lies a serious danger to British trade. It in a danger, however, which Britiah merchants have never yet heen able to make the Foreign-ofrice appreciate. It is not the less grave on that account, as we shall one day experiertee, unless wisdom and foresight can be forced on that de artment. But Brazil has another temptation to place British trade at a disadvantage in her deep sense of the injustice with which Englaand treats her new slave trade policy. In S14 a Brazil, as she had a right to do, terminated the right of search. Lord Aberdeen retaliated by an Act "gainst which Brazil solemnly protested as an attack on her overeienty and nationality. But in passing th-i statute Lord Aberdeen explicitly atated t4 the Brazillan Governinent that it would he repealed on one of two events-the tetual suppression of the African slave trade by Brazil, or the conclusi.n of a new slave trade treaty. I have before8shown you that during the last five years only 26-I mighttruthfully have said only 23-Africans have been imported into the empire, and that Lord Palmerston in July last told the Elouse of Commons ' "the slave trade might te considered as extinct in Brazil." The contingency on which Lord Aberdeen In 1845 assured tre Brazilian Government that the Act should be repealed has therefore occurred. But the Foreign- nfice refuses to fulfil the promise Lord Aberdeen made, and in March, 1856, it proceeded to threaten Brazil with violence under ciromnstances which provoked your censure in a very remarkable and useful article. If the Foreign-office reply that Brazil has not yet concluded a new slave trade treaty, the answer is that Lord Aberdeen's promise was on the alternative occurrence either of suppression without a treaty, or of a treaty without suppression, aiid that the more important of these contingencies has come to pass. But whose fault is it that Brazil has not concluded a new slave trade treaty? Since 1845 there have been three projects of such treaties. First, Lord Howden, in 1847. presented to the Cabinet of .lio a draught, but not for discussion or for sigsrature; consequent]y it was not signed; secondly, M. de Macedo presentt- d in 1&53 a Brazili.n draught, based on Lord Howden's, which draught Lord ClArendon would not discues; thirdly, in the same year Lord Clarendon presented to M. de Macedo a counter-project of his own, compared with which Lord Howden's draught was moderation and temperance. Suffdoe it here to say that it would have placed every slave in the empire at the mercy of Foreign-office Commissioners. To IthM. de Macedo conld only reply :-U Une telle stipulation non seulement serait contrarre aux drotts de souveralnerd du Br~esi, rnais elle causerait ls ruine de l'empire * elle le boule- erserait completernent et 'ereserait it des convulsions nui pourr-aient ahontir ai l a disparition d n Bredil de la llste des nations civilisees."-Class L, p.139, Slave Trade Papers, hi de Macedo retired from the negotiation, and then Lord Clayendon had the candour to tell him that the British Government preferred the Act to any treaty. SIO the question of the Slave Trade Treaty now stands. Whe ther Lrd Carendon is right in his preference for the Act as a measure of slave trade repression your space will not permit the discussion of. What I desire to fix your attention on is, that until the statute be repealed we can have no permanent political or commercial relations with Brazil. Our immense commerce with that empire is without a single provision of any kind to guard or protect it, and, as I have shown you, it is in a situation of very considerabia danger. Mr. Roeback seemas to have Rot his eye frxea on ibe subject, &ad if in addition I sal hl ave suncceeded in rowing your attention to it, then we mnay hope for some inVzoe,. ment in. *ue relations witl Brazil.

MSACRESrER EXHIBITION OF ART TBEASURES. (Continued from 27iU Tinms of May 27.) The early art of Germany, Flanders, and the Netherlands is not less completely illustrated in the Malnchester Exiibition than that of Italy. The works of the Teutonic painters of the 15th and 16th centuries are hung on the north wall of saloon A, facing those of their Italian contemporaries. An opportunity is thus afforded of comparing the very different characteriatics of these two great national schools. A continuous xurvey of these opposite walls impresses one more than any study of detached examples can do with the superiority of the Italian to the German in the effort after elevated and ideal beauty. We see how soon. and how strongly the fantastic element of the German imagination fastens npon the national art, betraying itself alike in broken and angular draperies, motley and crude colouring, exaggeration of expression, and a tendency to caricature wvherever personages from common life are introduced. At the same time it ia observable that this fantastic element, so destructive of solemnity and unity, is less apparent in the earliest works of the two leading German schools-tnat of Flanders, as exemplified in the Van Eycks and their earliest followers; and that of Cologne, as here illustrated by the pictures of Meister Stephan (380), the "Master of the Passion" (379), and the small but very valuable triptych of Mr. Hope (382). The school of Cologne, though two out of the three examples of it here are later than the works of Van Eyck, has a right to be first considered, as it had an unbroken connexion with the Lower Rhenish school of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, of which the only surviving illustrations are to be found in illuminated manuscripts, and in somne half-efaced wal paintings in the church of St. Ursula and in the choir of the Cathecdral at Cologne. The painters of Cologne and Maestricht are aUuded to in the Parzival of Wolfram von Eschenbach, which dates about 1200. Towards the end of the fourteenth century Meister Wilhelm (1380-1400) was the chief of this school, but he was surpassed by his pupil Meister Stephan (1442-1451). A precious and well-marked example of the early Cologne school here is Mr. A. B. B ope's triptych, divided into numerous compartments, containing sainta under canopies (882), This shows on a minutle scale the leading peculiarities and meritsi of the school,-its gold gromnd, light and delicate colour, simple aud graceful draperies, elevation of expression, and beauty of featura. Thes qualit'a are shown in these diminutive but beautifully tnishe Ai figures even more conspicuouHlv than in the larger group of " St. Catherine of £ iem.aedt: with St. Matthew and St. John thl U- - I, (380), from the Wallertein (7OUe - '..bited by Prince AlbExrt. Witl t:Js p. *ti should be compared the "<Pr _itation of the Temple" (381)), fromr the an.s collection, attributed to this master, oouinonly called from his great work in the Lyversberg Collection, the "Master of the Lyversberg Passion." In both maybe tracedthe same characteristic beauties of delicate, harmonious, and cheerful colour, with a peculiarly placid and pure expression in the heads, which, as well as the draperies, are quite free from that contortion and ugliness to which the Flemish and Nuremberg schools showed so overpowering a tendency. These pictures are aU in tempera, the use of oil pigments, though no secret at the time they were painted, being confined to the colouring of statues and wooden shrines Hubert and John Van Eyck (1366-1445) are usually described as the discoverers of painting in oil. Without going at length into the controversy on the subject, wee may state that the conclusion to which careful examination has led the best-informed inquirers is, that the brothers di covered rather a new mode of painting with varnish in combination with oil. The use of resinous varnish as a coating for tempera pictures was familiar to both Italian and Flemish painters before the time of the Van Eycks, but by none before them was varnish actually mixed with the colours. Hubert (1366-1426) was the elder brother, and in all probability the discoverer of the new medium, though the honour of the discovery has been monopolized by his younger brother John (1400-1445). Born at Maaseyck, their early studies were no doubt conducted, if not under the masters of Cologne, at least under the influence of that school; but the changes introduced by them into the manner of the earlier painters entitle them to be regarded as founders of a new style in their art. Ghent was the principal scene of Hubert's labours; he was received a member of the painters' guild of that city in 14127. is brother and pupil took service early-probably about 1417-under John, Prince-Bishop of Lige, and in 1425 was appointed valet de chamre to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, by whom he was employed, not only as painter, but in various confidential missions, among others on the Embassy to Lisbon, in 1428, to negotiate the Prince's marriage with Isabel of P'ortugal. On his return frofn this journey he took up his permanent residence in Bruges, where he didi 14401. The masterpiece of the two brothers and the greatest picture of the Flemish school is the altarpiece of the " Mystic Lamb," of whichthe Manchester Exhibition contains the only perfect copy (375). This great work was begun by Hubert on the commission of Jodocus Vydts, Lord of PamMle, and one of the burgher nobles of Ghent, as an altar-piece for his family chapel in the cathedral of St. Bavon. It was left unfinished at Hubert's death ia 1426, and was completed by John in 1432, when the chapel was consecrated, and the masterpiece of the Van Eycks hung in its place, with great pomp and rejoicing. Phiuip II. coveted the picture, but was obliged to content himisel- with a copy by Michael Cox:cie. The King himself vrote to Titian to send him some ultramarine for the mantle of the Virgin, as Coxcie could find none genuine in Flanders. This copy was stolen from Madrid by one of the French genFrals, and the different portions of it are now dispersed. The copy in this Exhibition was made about 1600, and originally hung in the chapel of the Town-hall at Ghent. It was sold by the French in 1796, and subsequently pawed into the hands of M. Aders. Its present possessor and exhibitor is Mr. J. L. Lemm6. The original has often been imperilled. It narrowly escaped the Flemish iconoclasts in 1566. ID. 1691 it was with difficulty saved from a fire. In 1786 Joseph IT., passing through Ghent, was shocked by the nudity of the Adam and Eve who form the subjects of the outer panels of the upper coinpartment. They were consigned to a cellar in deference to the Royal mcruples, and have never since been re- laced. In 1794 those arch-robbers the French mmissaries carried off the centre panels; the other compartments were hid by the chapter. At the close of the war the centre panels were brought back from Paris and restored to the city. It will scarcely be believed that, after escaping so many risks, the six side panels were sold by the canons of the cathedral in 1816 to M Nieuwenhuys, who, while the Flemish courts were discussing the legality of the transaction, disposed of his prize to Mr. Solly for 4,0001., from whom they passed to the King of Prussia for 600,000 dollars, and now form one of the principal glories of the Berlin Gallery. In 1822 what was left of the original picture at Ghent only escaped burning for the second time by the courageous self-devotion of some workmen, who de- tachedandbrought out the picture while the cathedral was in flames. The copy here exhibited is the only one which shows all the inner paintings in their original places. The outaide of the shutters was painted with an Annunciation above, below with full-length figures of St. John the Evangelist and StL John the Baptist, and the portraita of Jodocus Vydts and his wife. The whole work is made up of two centre compartments, an. upper and a lower, with a double shutter on each aide of either compartment. The upper central compartment represents in the centre God the Father, with the Virgin on His right and John the lBaptist on His left. These are all from the hand of Hubert. On the panel next the Virgin is a choir of singing angels; on the outermost panel, next this, a full-length figure of Adam; on the panel next the Baptist is a grou of angels playing on various instruments; beyva? them, corresponding with the Adam, a nude jve, -with the apple in her hand. The lower central compartment represents Paradise as a flowery lava, approached by alleys of trees. In the cento, ea a pedestal, stands the Lamb slain for the tm of the wolld, encircled by angels worshipping prnd swnging censerm From right and left, in fo,.teground and background, troops of saints and martyrs advance along the green alleys ° ter the fowery lawn, to pay their homage to the Lamb; the clerkly fathers, aints, and marwyrs o the church on the right, the lay fait;bu onx X it. Tlisee tEb troops of worshippers are continued in the side panel& Along those of the right hand pious hermits and pilgrims advance through a woodedvaUeyconspicuous among them strides St. Christopher. On the left hand panels ride fLirt a troop of Christian knights armed at proof, led b St. George, St. Sebastian, and St. Michae, the patron saints of the Flemish guild, with penoncels displayed. Behind them march a sober array of mounted civilians. Of these the mild old man in blue velvet tLimmed with fur, on the gray horse, is the portrait of ERabert Van Eyck. John rides nearer the centre of the group, in black, and looking towards the spectator. To him is attributed all but the three great figuresof tbe upper compartment and the Adam and Eve. There is a rare unity of conception in this noble work, in which Creation, Fall, and Atonement are grandly and intelligibly symbolized. For beauty and diguity combined, nothing of the Teutonic school is comparable to the three upper figures. The Virgin especially has a simple and statelv loveliness never excelled bythegreatest of the Italians. In softness and depth of colour Hubert's work excels that cf his younger brother. Its more antique character may be due to the subject. The copy here shown has been very carefully made, and in drawing is unexceptionable, though the colouring faUs far below the original in vigour and brilliancy. Altogether this, which may be called the first fruits of Flemish oil painting, is also beyond comparison its masterpiece. Neither of the other five works here ascribed to John Van Eyck can be referred to as an undoubted example. Indeed, there is only one of which we may not say that it is undoubtedly nof a work of the master; this is Lord Ward's picture, "The Mass of St. Gregory" (381). This picture originally formed the panel of an altar-piece; the corresponding panel, representing St. Giles in a landscape extractmg an arrow from the back of a faun, is now in the gallery of Mr. T. Barin. Those inveterate doubters, Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle, in their elaborate and conscientious work on the early Flemish painters,* attribute both these paneis to an imitator of Van Eyck. They seemn rather inclined to forget that a master does not always paint up to the level of his finest works. This picture is certainly inferior in roundness of forms and fusion of colour to the lower panels of the "'Mystic Lamb." But, looking at the force of the heads and the admirable imitative finish of the details, particularly those of the ornaments of the altar, we feel at a loss to what painter of the time, other than John Van Eyck, they can be ascribed with any probability. We should be inclined to feel less hesitation in ascribing the two pictures of the "Virgin and Child" (384 and 385)-one from Mr. Hope's collection, the other from that of the Duke of Newcastle, to Jan Mostaert, of Haarlem, an Imitator of the school of Van Eyck. They have the peculiar reddish-brown tone characteristic of that master. The Van Eycks were contemporary with Ma,accio, and they mark as decided an advance in Teutonic art as Masaccio in Italian. But, whereas the influence of Masacelo spread beyond the limits of Tuscany and gave an impulse to aU Italian painting, which from his time was progressive, that of Van Eyck seems rapidly to have been counteracted by the inherent tendency of the Teutonic mind at once to the fantastic and the literal. Even in John's pupil, Roger Van der Weyden (1401-1464), as we may see from the numerous pictures here ascribed to that master (388, 412, 415, &c.), this tendencyalready showeditself in a very decided form. His " Ecce Homo " (388) and his " Mater Dolorosa' (389), with all their strong expression of suffering and their forcible presentation of the incidents of torture, -the eyes red with weeping, the thorns of the cross actually piercing the skin, or shown in the blue swelling under it, and the profuse tears-produce an effect rather repulAive than affecting. The suffering and sorrow are too material and commonplace. We are most itnpressed neither by the divine resignation of the Saviour nor the maternal agony of the Virgin, but by the mere expression of physical pain in both. In the painter's more crowded compositions, as " the Descent from the Cross" (412), or " the Adoration of the Kings" (415), the mind is distracted from its contemplation of the expression of the heads and the dramatic proprieties of the action by the multifa.rious details of elaborate ornament, the play of contorted and highly coloured drapery, or the intrusion of some grotesque form or faceinan attendant or bystander. There is a deficiency in the power of subordinating parts to the whole, and a want of grandeur and repose in all the lines of the composition. Taken individually, many of the faces have profound expression, and many of the movements and attitudes are truthful and appropriate. But the sense of this comes last instead of first. There are several pictures here ascribed to an imaginary " Ioger Van der Weyden the younger" (387, 407, 414), of whose existence there is no satisfactory proof. The name seems simply a convenience for classing works of the school of Van Der Weyden which are clearly unworthy of the hand of the master himself. Roger Van Der Weyden has most interest for us as the instructor of the most spiritnal and delicate painter of the school of Bruges-llaus Memlingof whom there are several undoubted examples in this gallery. Memling is one of the most interesting and mysterious figures in the history of Flemish art. Widely as his works are spread, in Italy, Ekgland, Germany, and Spain, and great as is the admiration they have always commanded, Van Mander, wrting 100 years after his death, spoke of his existence as known to him rather from looking at his pictures, than from any information he could obtain of the period even when he lived, much more of the incidents of his ife. His finest works arein the Hospital of St. John at Bruges. Few of our readers who have tarried in that sad, but beautiful old town, but have seen the " Chasse of St. Ursula," the " Spozalizio," and the "Sibyl Zambeth " which preserve his name and reputation as one of the most tender and masterly of early painters. The legend that associates these pictures with the hospital tells how after the rout of Charles the Bold at Nancy, in 1477, on a winter's night, a wan aud wounded soldier, from the wreck of the Burgundian army, rung at the gate of the hospital, and was found lying senseless on its threshold; how taken in and tended by the pious brotherhood and charitable sisters, he regained his strength, and asking for brushes and colours, painted, in pious gratitude, the pictures which are now the glories of the hospital. The story is, of course, doubted by the authors already referred to, but it is so touching a tale that we crave leave to believe it a little longer. A "Juan Flamenco," supposed to be identical with hTemling, painted in the Carthusian convent at Miraflores episodes from the life of St. John the Baptist, between 1496 and 1499. There is an altarpiece in the gallerv of the Duke of Devonshire at Chirwick, with portraits of the Cliffords, which seems undoubtedly from his hand. There is in this Exhibition a portrait (400), formerly in the collection of Mr. Samuel Rogers, with the date 1672, said to be a likeness of Memling, in the dress of the Hospital of.St. John. The date is inconsistent with the story which attributes the painter'swounds to the battle of Nancy. But the portrait bears strong traces of Meraling's hand. The half length near it of a youth, in a dark purple dress, holding an arrow in his hand, and called therefrom a "tSt. eb_atiau"(398), is in the OpiniOn of M. Cavalcaselle-a-very competent judge-a work of Antonello da Messina.. If so, it has a peculiar interest, as the only example here of the first Italian who acquired from the Van Eycks the secret of their new method of painting, and through whom it was introduced into Venice, Naples, and Tuscany. From him Gian Bellini is said to have. stolen the secret, by sitting to him in the character of a Venetizn noble and watching him while he worked. Antonello imparted it to his friend Dacmenico Veneziano, and he was murdered by Andrea Castagno, of Florence, in order that the method w1kich he had acquired from Domenico might be his sole possession. From Csastagno it spread through Tuscany, and the memory of the murderer has ever since been infamous. IUndoubtedly from the hand of Memliug are the two wings of a triptych (401, 403), the one representing an aged woman, with her patron saint, the other a kneeling warrior, with St. George in armour. In the former the painting of the old woman's face is in the highest degree powerful and true to nature. The saint vwho attends her br all the sweetness and tenderness of the master. The kneeling knight and his patron saint are more impressive in their solemnity of colour and eame4t gravity of expression. The landscapes in both pictures are painted with a mingledforce and softness which prove Neinling at least the equal of Van Eyck in this branch of the aFt The triptych (397), with a denosition from tlhu cross in the centre, offthe wings St. James of lahlipestella and St. Christophera seems tous ale 1xtobear internal evidence of authenticity, though of a leis decided character. The St. Christopher is a renti. tion in little of the painter's great picture of the same saint in the Academy of Bruges. We may with more confidence amign to Memling the portio of a triptych (401) containing St. John the Baptist, the supposed fi-aure of the donor, and St. Georgoe. The figure of the Baptist in particular in marked by all the best characteristics of the painter, and is the finest small work of his hand we know, except the marvellous pictures in the Chfie of St. Ursula. From Memling we come in order of chronology to Quintin Matsys (1450-1529), the blaeksmith of Antwerp, whose story is familiar to every one. Connubialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellem" is the terse line which describes how for love he forswore hammer and pincers to take up palette and brush. Of his education in art we know nothing, but the school of Antwerp was in his time fullv impregnated with the influence of Van Eyck and Memling, and though Matays introduced new force into the school his must be considered as essentially an ofshoot of the art of Bruges. Something of the vigour of his robuster training in a handicraft seems reflected in his works. His masterpiece in religious painting is the admirable "Piet%," in the Museum at Antwerp; but his chef d'oeuvre as a painter of common life is exhibited here,-."The Misers" (445), sent by Her Majesty from Windsor. ln this pictlre, as in the great altar-piece of the Van Eycks, we seem to see one of those works which mark a decided advance in the art, which we wonder to find have not created an epoch, from which a new power is brought intoplay. Painted with a breadth which yet involves no slurring or sacrifice of the minutest truth, as fine in chiaroscuro and as forcible in modelling as auy work of Titian's, these heads possem at the same time the utmost individuality of character. You find yourself possessed by an intense desire to supply the story in wbich these two shrewd old burghers are actors. The title, as itseems to us, is calculated to mislead upon this point. They are not misers. The one, as we interpret the incident, has brought the jewel which lies upon the table, near the cotton in which it has been wrapped, for sale or pledge. A sum has been agreed on. But the worldwide trade of Antwerp having amvased in the hands of its traffickers coin of all denominations, it is necessary to reduce this motley mintage to a common value before paying over the amount settled. This the one with spectacles on nose is doing in his ledger. You may read the actual inscription on its pages if you are familiar enough with the crabbed character of the 15th century. Having done so, you will find he is calculating the net amount, or common Flemish currency, of so many escudos or Spanish crowns, so many doubloons so many rose nobles, and so many ducats; and we doubt not a numisstatist would have no difficulty in identifying tho coins lying on the table with theactual denominations which we have just given from the ledger itself. The old money-lender has come to the odd coppers, and the pledger of the jewel is evidently cracking some joke on the subject of these coppers, laughing at the other's scrupulous accuracy in accounting, or insisting on receiving his money to the uttermost farthing. It is one comfort of such careful story-telling in art that we may read the picture like a book, or look on at the transaction as at a scene of actual life. The other pictures here ascribed to Matays are very inferior to this. But Dr. Waagen, from special study of his works, is confident that the altar-piece with wings (416), representing in the centre the Virgin and Child, with Eaints and angels bringing offerings of fruits and flower to the Divine babe, and -groups of saints on either wing-all in a trim and shaded pleasaunc.-is a work of the painter's earlier time. If so, the advance indicated by the masterly picture of the " Misers" is indeed astonishing, and leaves us without wonder that the man who could so progress in half a lifetime could rise from the lowly occupation of a blacksmith to the art of a painter. The "Madonua and Child" (448) is another work of the earlier time of Matsys. The "Weeping Madonna" (451), also ascribed to him, seems to us more likely to be the work of one of his sons, of whom more than one became artists. It lacks altogether the force of hand and expression which we cannot but look for in the painter of the " hlisers," and the absence of them is not accounted for, as in the larger altar-piece already referred to, by the nature of the* subject. We cannot believe that he. who painted the weeping Magdalene of the great Antwerp picture (the finest conception, without exception, which we can recall in al painting, of the ground swell of grief-that settled agony which survives when tears have been dried up) could ever have been so feeble au exponent of human sorrow as he was who painted this head. Matsys left no successor who deserves to be named in the same breath with himself, nor did the school of Antwerp answer to the impulse which one would suppose such a painter must have communicated to it. The school of Holland had participated in the influence of the Van Eycks, whose native town bordered on that country; but we have no record of any conspicuous Dutch master before Engelbrechsten of Leyden (1468-1533), of whose fewv known works the exhibition furnishes no example. His more celebrated pupi', however, Lucas Van Leyden (1494-1533), is here present in a striking little picture (422), " A Card Party," from the gaUery of Lord Pembroke, as well as in one of his portraits of the Emperor Maximilian (435), his own portrait (452), and a " St. Jerome" (456). There is no painter to whom it is more difficult to ascribe any picture with confidence, for his engravings, by which he was even more celebrated during his short but most laborious life than by his pictures, were so popular that pictures were frequently painted from them by imitators of this master, and now pass under his name. Lucas Van Leyden is the most striking instance on record of prematurity of power not degenerating but sustained up to the last.] Born in .1494, at 9 he published copperplates of his own desigamng and engraving. At 12he painted the Legend of St. Hubert, indistemper, for the Seignior of Lockhorst, for which he is said to have been paid in as many pieces of gold as he counted years. At 3.5 he designed and engraved the " Scenes of the Passion," a " Temptation of St. Anthony," and a " Conversion of St. Paul." This activity continued till his 33d year, when, wom out by excessive labour, he fitted up a treckshuyt, and, putting himself on board, visited Rotterdam, Walcheren, and Middleburg, where he met and took on board as his guest John Gossaert, known as John of Maubeuge, and with him and other gay companions traversed the canals of Filanders and Brabant, everywhere feasting the artists, and making joyous cheer. An illness followed, attributable perbaps to these feastings, but ascribed by the painter bimself to poison administered by some rival in art. He languished for six years, working wth brush and buria till his hands could hold them no longer, and died at 39, leaving behind him few paintinu but the greatest number of the most elaboorate en- gravings which hate ever been produced by a singyle hand. These are stiU of high value, and fine examples of many of the rarest and most fkmou. may be seen in the admirable Gallery of Ebgravings, which the Manchester Exhibition owes to the labourB of Mr. Holmes and the still move valuiable resources of Messrs. Colnaghi and Scott. Of the pictures here acribed to~ this mastr the "Card Party" is the best, and may,. with most confidence be cited as authentic, lt is full of brilliancy in coloar, with well-distributed lighlt and shade, and e:xcellent action an& exprssion. in tho group rotund the card-table. -The carnations ef tbe femle heads have flown, a raw csantiuearly Germsan,workl.

Never was profoundi veneration better rendered than in the gray-headed King, who kneeling proffers to the infant a golden, cup filled with barbarie coin. ,ess intelligent, but not less subduing, is the respect expressed in the faOW and action of the negro KLing, who holds in his hand4, but protected from their contact by an embroidered. napkin, the goreous chalice which is hii offering. Only in the rustics who have wandered to th:e outer palng which closes one entrance to the ruin is listless curiosity expresed instead of awe. The shep,. herds are entering reverently, uncovering their age& heads. King and peasant are levelled in that childish presence. And in the midst sitS the meek mother, pondering all in her heart, andc wondering and lwishing, yet scarce daring to, believe. We despair of giring any idea by words of the execution of the details in every part of this picture-in heads and hands, and draperies, brocade, and fur, velret and silk, jewelled collars, and girdles, gemmed chalce, and chain mail, the weeds that spring in the rifts of the pavement, the bricks of the wall, and the fragments of stonework that strew the ground. It is nothing short of marvellous. After seeing this picture we can readily beheve the story how the painter-having spent in drink the money given him by the Marquis de Veere, in whose service he then was, to new clothehimself, when Charles V. visited his lord's housepaimted a canvass suit to the semblance of the most elaborate damask, and was the grandest figure of the fdte. It is idle after this to speakof -the other examples of thismaster here shown. But, lest those wbo read our Temarks should think we overvalue the minute accuracy of detail lavished upon this canvass, we are anxious to remark that the expression bears out and overpowers the detail, and that while the work will bear inspection with the microscope it may be viewed at any distance, and will be found to preserve a harmonious breadth and unity of effect. Hera is only the finish whichkeeps adding truth to trath, as though the eye were a microseope and the hand untiring steel, not the finish which polishes, and rounds, and stipples for the sake of polishing, rounding, and stippling-trueand noble finish, in award, as opposed to false and effeminate fnish. The rest -of the Fiemish, Geran, and Dutch painters must form the subject of a future article; The admissions on Tuesday were 8,5'5, against 4,918 on the previous day. Of these 4,803 paid a shilling for their admission, whilst 3,72 were holders of ,eason-tickets.

FOBEIGN INTELLIGBNCE. (A porilon of tho followlnE appe.-ma in our second cdttton of yostrday:-] THE NEUCHATEL QUESTION (BY SUBMAR= AND BRITISH TEGRApH.) We have received the following telegraphic dea2atch from our Paris correspondent :_ " PARIS, WEDNzSDAy, MAY 27, 8 A.Mf. <cThe Moniteur confirms what I announced to you yesterday concerning the signing of the NeuchItel treaty. " This treaty finally regulates the question by the renunciation, on the part of the King of Prussia, of the sovereignty over the canton. " The ratifications will be exchanged within 21 days, when the text of the treaty will be published."
FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWIT Commmx ml) PARIS, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 6 P.M. The Plenipotentiaries met in conference to-day at 3 o'clock on the Neuchatel question. The sitting took place, as usual, at the I oreign-offlce, and was presided over by l. Walewski. As it was announced yesterday that every difficulty had been removed, it is very probable that the present meeting is the last, and tbat, though no assurance of the fact is officially given, the protocol will be signed before the present sitting is brought to an end.* A warning has been given by M.Billault, Minister of the Interior, to the Journal de-s Olternins de Fer of Saturday last, in the persons M. Mires, the director of that publication, and of M. Devina, the writer of the incriminated article, for having, in its " Bulletin de la Semaine," published remarks " calumniating the intentions which suggested the note of March 9, 1856; the law on joint-stock companies; the decree concerning the entrance-fee to the Bourse; the railway concessions lately made; the bill on the Bank of France: and tendinog to throw on the Government the responsibility of the embarrassments which might be produced in business by the excesses arising from speculation and gambling, whereas, on the contrary, all the measures adopted have for their object to prevent such evils*" The following is the article of the ,Touraldes Chwmints de Fer which has provoked the anger of the lMinister of the Interior:- " The paralysis which affects our market, far from disappearing, seems to extend itself each day. Securities of every kind experience the greatest depression, the evident symptom of the general discouragement which has come over the pablie mind. The time has now arrived when the efforts made since the peace of Paris to repress the spirit of enterprise, if not to annihilate it altogether, begin to produce their fruit. Such an effect could not have been felt at once, for the impulse had been given, and could not be arrested suddenly, just as when a ball is fired off it is not possible to suspend its course. It was therefore necessary to wait, in suite of the attempts made to stop the movement, as it was not possible to repress it in a moment. The impulse given to the spirit of speculation by the public subscription to the loins, and by the unprecedented progress of the railroad receiptS, was too strong for any one to bring speculation to a standstill. But it was certain that the measures adopted to allay the spirit of enterprise would have the conse. quences anticipated. The note of the 9th March announcing the suppression of every new undertaking during 1856 was the first signal for that tendency which, as we have often observed, was well meant, though we had foreseen that the results would, according to us, ba injurious to the public credit. Consequently, foreign Powers, profiting by the spirit of enterprise so keenly developed in France, drew towards them, by means of concessions and other important advantages, the capital which the French Government rejected. The note of the 9th of March did not affect societies en commandite, and by that outlet capital was still applied to undertakings of public utility, such as the ports and gaslighting of Marseilles. At once, however, a law in tervened to prevent the formnation of any new company en commandite. The law produced the desired effect, and since its promulgation no new company has been formed. From long habit, a numerous crowd frequented the Bourse; the result was, a superabundance of activity in busines. A check was applied by the imposition of a duty on entering the doors of the Bourse. The consequence was, that the customers who gave life to the market gradu. ally retired, other habits were adopted by the numerous ad wealthy persons who had frequented the Bourse, and at this moment our market is only visited by certain comopolitan bankers, and by a swarm of unlicen-ed brokers (courtiers-sarrons), who, having no customers, play against each other. Last year many companies wore formed to obtain concessions of railroads, Some proposed a second line from Paris to Tours-others asked for branch lines; the latter proposed strategic roads, the former wished to undertake roads comprised within the great lines, &c. But since his Excelienoy the Minister of Pablic Works has resolved to grant everything to great companies, aU these individual efforts have boen suspended, and the languor of the Bourse has extended to all minds as well as to all transactions. This little retrospective review will explain the situation of our market, and if we consider that, under the influence of facts such as we have enumerated, foreign capital which fed the Paris Bourse has boon withdrawn, we can comprehend that we shall not readily get out of the state of torpor in wlhich we are plunged. The Bil relating to the Bank of France might stiUl give a certain impulse to public credit, but this plan is prepared solely with a view to the necessities of the Treasury, although, perhaps, it would have been better to consolidate a portionof the floating debt by a loan and allocate to the general development of commerce and manufactures the new resources placed at the disposal of the Bank of France. Owing to that cause our Three per Cents., notwithatanding the period for paying the dividend approaches, are nct kept up, and every day become weaker. Railways, notwithstanding their excellent receipts, suffer from the reaction of a generaUy bad situation of affairs, of which the souroe Is in the macts enumerated above. It may be remembered that some weeks ago we alluded to the call made on the shares of the Ardennes Railway, and we observed that,with the nego. tiations pending for the fusion of that company with the Strasburg, it was to be regrettedthat a measure was adopted Eo calloted to depreciate the shares, This fusion, it is said. is to be now completed," Advices from Bagdad mention that Mr. Murray, who had been several weeks in that city, was to leave on the 15th of the present month for Teheran, with the persons attached to his Legation. When it was known that a treaty of commerce wan in course of negotiation between the French and Russian Governments, several of the chambers of commerce in the departments addressed observations at some length to the Government, suggesting various modifications in the existing relations between the two countries. These suggestions have been taken into consideration and approved. They have also, it appears, been admitted by the Russian Government,, rnd will be introduced into the definitive treaty at p resent under consideration. When Feruk Ehan received hin despatches from Teheran, announcing the ratification of the treaty of peace with England, he gave orders to have a medal struck, at his own expense, commemorative of the treaty. A Bill for increasing the pay of captains, lieutenants, and sub-lieutenants, in the army of the line by 150f. a-year has been passedunanimously by the Corpa Legislatif. A letter from Nantes of the 24th, in the Constiittionnev, gives an account of the Grand Duke Constantine's visit to Tndret:- " When the authorities came out in the Parisien steamer to pay their respects to the Duke they found the Reine flortense at anchor, but as his Imperial Highness was reposing, after the fatigues of a very rough passage, they were compeUed to remain until he was visible. When the Grand Duke entered the cabin where the authorities were assembled, he was astonished at seeing so many embroidered uniforms, and said that he had hoped to be received without any ceremony. The Duke and his suite then embarked on board the smaller steamer, which proceeded on her way, under the direction of Lieutenant de Werneia, who has the command of the port and of the pilots of the Loire. A handsome breakfast was ready, with covers laid for 18 persons, and during the repast ananimated oonversation was kept up. The Duke appeared to take pleasure in speaking of the courteous attentions which he had received from the Emperor, and of the amiability of the Empress, Soon after 2 o'clock the Parisien arrived at Indret, where the Gr;nd Duke wasl received at the laud. ing-plce by x d'Ingles, the director of the establish- rment, and L Moll, the sub-director. The Duke wore plain clothes, and, as a fine cold rain had been faling duing the whole day, over a black frock coat he had on a waterproof cloak, with a large hood. He wore on his head a small naval cap without any distinctive mark beyond a white band He carried in his hand a thick knotty stilk, on which he leant, end appeared to show a llttle lamenes in walking The Duke immediately proceeded to the works under thS guidnee of X d'Ingles. Ho first went to the foundry, * Vido telegraphio de8patob0 where a mnaguificent scene awaited him. At the moment he entered a quatity of liquid iron w/as being poured out into ioulds ranged along in symmetrical order. The quantity thus cast wlas the produca of 6000 kdlogrammes of iron, Ntunerous other articles were afterwards cast in pro. sence of the Prmce. From the foundry the Grand Dake went to the forges, where he saw a block of red hot iron weighing 16,000 kilograinmes turned round and round while being beaten with a hammer weighng 8,000 kilogrammes, every blow from which made the very ground tremble. This mass is intended for the shaft of a steam-engine of 900-horse power. From this place the Grand Duke proceeded to the engine-room, where he stopped for some time, admiring the machinery prepared for the Mass6na, of 90 guns, now being built at Toulon. The Prince appeared to take great notice of everything ho saw, and made frequent re. marks to a captain in the Russian navy who was with him, and who has been for some time at Bordeaux, superintend. ing the construction of the Russian vessels now on the stocks in that port. The whole visit occupied nearly three hours, after which the Prince and his suite re-embarked on board the steamer, and returned down the river." A deputation of the, Municipal Council of Paris, headed by M. Haussman, Prefect of the Seine, was received yesterday by the King of Bavaria, who acceptedthe invitatiOn to the ball which will be given in his honour, at the Hotel de Vile, on Thursday. The King will attend at the Opera tonight. A letter received from Oran, of the 20th inst., says that the appearance of the crops in the three provinces of Algeria is splendid. The quality of the grain is superior to that of last year, and its forwardness astonishing. Barley of this year's growth has already been converted into meal, and the produce is most satisfactory to the miller This fact proves howv much earlier the harvest is gathered in Algeria than in France. Accounts from Bona state that the light rains which have fallen there have improved the crops wonderfully, and promise a most abundant harvest. The breadth of land sown under corn this year is much greater than that of last. The wheat, as well as the barley, is advancing to maturity.

The following is the text of the proclamation which was addressed to the Kabyles by Marshal Randon at the moment of entering on his expedition:- "Labyles,-We have frequently offered you the advantages of peace, and a particpation in the benefits of our commerce; to Uow you to travel through the counltries subjeeted to our rule, and to carry hack to your mountains the indformation which you might thus acquire. Some of you have comprehended our good intentions, but others have been lel asway by their violent antipathy to strangers. France has now resolved to carry her victorious standard into the very heart of your mountains. The hour has arrived for those wvho have been faithful to us to be rewarded, and for intrigumrs and agitators to be punished. It is to you more particularly, people of the Beni-Eaten, that we address ourselves. You have violated sworn engage ments; you have set at nought the obligations imposed on you by your promises, made first to the Sebt of the Beni Yahia, and afterwards renewed at Algiers. You have dared to raise the standard of insurrection in opposition to France. You havo not only excited disturbance in your own country, but have pre;ched up revolt among your neighbours, who have long enjoyed Eall the blessings of peace under our protection; and, lastly, you have dared our power by attacking Tizi.Ouzou. You have therefore only yourselves to blame for the ravages of war, and the many misfortunes it brings in its tra You wiU be responsible to your brethren, who only wish to profit by the benefits of tranquUlity.

(FROM OUR OWN CORSROXDwzT.) BERLEN, MAy 25. Considerable diversity of opinion obtains, as I observe, among the organs of our press on the question of the political advantages, if any, to be gained by England in the matrimonial alliance about to be entered upon by the two Royal families of Great Britain and Prussia. Allow me to make an attempt at clearing up some points connected with this question. Under no combination of circumstances within the limits of probability can Great Britain reckon on Prubsia as an ally in an aggresuive war to be carried on against any of the great Powers of Europe. Her geographical position, hemmed in as she is between Russia, France, and Austria, will always prescribe to her the policy of not commencing hostilities with a permanent neighbour for the sake of any transient combination of motives. Again, Prussia has no army, in the widest sense of the word. Her military force consists partly of a eonstantly shifting body of recrauit, and partly of a militia, who havo learned, it is true, the use of arms, but have become fathers of families, heads of firma, men of professional eminence or costly members of society, since the time when they served in the rank and file. Again, Prussia has no financial stamina. The Government can raise loans very easUy, because the unenterprising disposition of the people leads them to prefer the certain 4 per cent. of the State to the precarious 10 or 15 per cent. to be got out of some commercial adventure; but that 4 per cent. it is almost beyond the power of any Mmister to raise, so defective is the system of finance and so excessive the "ignorant impatieneo of taxation" in this country. Furthermore, the calling out of the Landwehr inflicts the most ruinous consequences on the country, by depriving it of its best productive powers at the moment when the full unimpaired enjoyment of all its rersources is mosi essential. Although it is the fashion to call Prussia a great military Power, she could no more aid us with an army for aggressive purposes than she could with a navy ; and the eternal reference that has been made to the memory of Frederick the Great and to Blucher during the late war in the East had as much appliecation to the Prussia of to-day as allusions to ancient Athens and Sparta, to Marathon and Thermopyle, toc Leonidas and Epaminondas, have to the present kingdom of Greece. But, although Prussia is all but impotent to carry on an aggressive war of any dimensions, and least of all a 6abinet war, one in which the feehngs of the people are not deeply interested, she would not be found so wanting if called upon to defend herself against invasion or against republican rebellion; and in the same way it may be asumed, that if England herself were invaded, the monarchy threatened, or Protestantismn endangered, the i4- iluence of the projected matrimonial alliance would befelt in the exhibition of ready and efficient succou.~ s i wa inthetim ofWilliam Ill. anid his struggle with the Papacy under James II., when Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, sent i his Marshal Schomberg and his beat Brauden- I burghers to fight the battle of Proteatantimxa, so it would be again if Proteatantlsm were endangered or the monarchy threatened ia England, for these are the two vital principles of Prussia, and in England's power and influence she sees one of the best guarantees, in addition to 'her own exertions, for their being upheld in both countries and even spread into others. For the purposes of aggressive war, then, the Prussian sympathies and alliance are totaUy valueless to England; in a war of defence it would not be so by any means. On the field of every peaceful activity, the exertions of diplomacy, and in anything short of going to war, the sympathies of Prussia wi 1 continue to be with England, as they were unnistakeably during the whole of the Orient %I war, in spite of our being allied with her old enemy, France, and at war with her oAd friend, Russia. The position which she assumed towards our enemy, Russia, was not that of neatrality, buxt of non-activity-precisely the same line of conduct she observed in favour of the Russians against the Poles in their last struggle. She not only joined with us in the diplomatic coalition against Russia at the Vienna Conferences, but when we went to war, although she herself remained inactive, she lent us pilots in the Baltic, supplied us with coals for our steamers, and prohibited the passage of arms and ammunition through her territory from Belgium to Russia, while she permitted her own manufacturers t) supply us with powder. In every diplomatic conference, both before and after the war, at which a representative of Prussia was present, the protocols record him as the most forwxard to second every motion made by the representative of England, and in every matter of international business since the war, the Sound Dues, the Stade Tolls, the reciprocation of admissibility to the coasting trade, in the reception of deputations sent here for information's sake, and in forwarding every English plan with reference to religion, education, and the arts, Prussia has shown the greatest alacrity and willingness to co-operate with us and to favoar our views. On this whole large field of common activity in times of peace we do already possess the sympathies of Prussia, for her own interests and tendencies are identical with ours. The vote of the Hoine of Commons with reference to the dowry for the Princess Royal is matter for considerable satisfaction here, for, although the advantage to be derived from it by the country is but an indirect one, the vote of any much smaller sum would have been looked upon as a slight, and as an evidence that the English nation was disposed, in a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence, to be bestowed on a Princess of its own Royal family, to testify its atil undiminished dissatisfaction at Prussia's non-activity in the late war with Russ;a. The approaching anion of the two families will not create sympathies for England in Prusssia: they exist already to the fullest extent that they could have obtained ander present circumstances, and, when the Prussian nation ceases to be abused for what it could not help, those sympathies will be still warmer and more expansive. If sympathy for England and affection for its Sovereign on the part of the King of Prassia could have evailed to prescribe a different course for his Government in the late war, that would have taken place; for, warm as the feelings of Prince Frederick William may be, who views England and everything English with a bridegroom's eyes, or of his father and mother, who e pe'aces present, at every step, some fresh evidence of their perfect communion with our Court and their thorough appreciation of everything English-ftllly as warm as all theee are the feelings of admiration and affection which the King entertains for our Queen. It was to England that he paid his first visit after his accession, to stand godfather to the Prince of Wales. England and Esngland's Queen form a frequent topic in his conversation and thoughts, and the Order of the Garter he wears entwined round the Star of the Black Eagle, the highest order in Prussia, vith theminiature of his mother, whose memory he idolizes, enshrined in the centre. There are few features3 more strongly pronounced in the Eing's character than attachment to the historical traditions and policy of his country; the English a]liance has been the load-star of Prussian policy ever since the Elector Frederick William helped William IIL to subdue his Papal antagonists in Ireland and elsewhere; the Duchess Sophia of Hanover, from whom our Royal family deacends in the male line, is the progenitrix of the Prussian Royal family in the female line, for her daughter, Sophia Charlotte,was the first Queen of Prussia, and her grandson, Frederick William L, the secoad King of Prursia, married her granddaughter, Sophia DorothLea, the daughter of George T. of England. It is a proud recollection in Prussia, and one that revives in full energy on occasion of tho forthcoming alliance, that from the union of this latter Prussian Prince with an English Princess Frederick the Great proceeded. The Duchess Sophia of Hanover, thae commaon raother of the two dynasties, was the g<randdaughter of James I. of E;ngland and VI. of Scotland, for she was fourth daughter c' Elizabeth, the unfortunate Queen of Bohenia, the daughter of that eccentric monarch. TURKEY. (FROM AN OCCASIONAL CORIRSPONDzNT.) CONSTANTINOPLE, MAY 18. II May, 1856, a firman was granted to Mr. Thomas Wilson and other persons, authorizing them to make a canal between Kostendje on the Black Sea and the Danube. The river at thii point is within 40 miles of the Black Sea, but meeting the uplands of the Dobrudscha is deflected t) the north, and flows a further distance of 200 mile3 before it finally falls into the sea. Had the canal, therefore, been carried out, a saving of nearly 20i miles of the worst navigation of the Danube, and of all the expense and dipnger attendant on entering that river at its mouth, would have been obtained; and, consequently, nearly the whole traffic of the Danube would have been directed to the new outlet. Indeed, the commercial advantages of the scheme were so apparent, and are so readily calculable, that, dazzled by the certain prospect of an enormous revenue, the promoters seemingly overlooked or debpiaed any engineering difficulties in the way of their enterprise. But at an early period after the firnian had been obtained the engineers (Messrs. Liddell and Gordon), to whom the project had meanwhile been submitted, reported that the canal would not only rove a most difficult and expensive work, but would, iuless made, as projected, on the level of the Danube, be much inferior in usefulnesi to a railroad. In consequence of this opinion, dotailed surveys, both f the railway and of the hart,our at IKostendje, were instituted by Mewsrs. Liddell and Gxordon in the autumn of last year, and a further investigation of the commercial bearing o° the beheme was intrusted to a committee of th3 subscribers, who at the same time visited both tha Danube and Constantinople for this purpose. Their report having proved even more favourable than had been anticipated and the estimated cost of t1he railway (40 miles5 and harbour, based on reliabie data, being found ineonsiderable, the subscribers constituted themselves a company, and applied to the Turkish Governmmnt for permission to make a railway instead of a canal. This application, after encountering the most strenuous oppositioni has at length been approved by the Council of MAinisters, and will now receive in due course the Imperial sanction. The junction of the Black Sea and the Danube in one shape or another has been before the Porte almost unromittingly since 1844, when it was promoted by the Austrians, and defeated by Russian influence. lumerous subsequent applications suffered the same fate, until during the war a canal firman was applied for in the names of Mr. Wilson, Count de Mormy, and Count de Breda, and being supported by the united efforts of the English, French, and Austrian Ambassadors, was at length granted by the Porte. This sanction was given reluctantly by the then Ministry, and this was due in no slight degree to a conviction, based on the reports of the former applicants, that a canal was (as it proved) impracticable. Hence, when it was known that the canal firman would not be acted upon, the news was received with feelings of anything but displeasure by a certain section of the politicians of this city, and their feelings of elation were subsequently further stimslated when it became known that the new railway application was promoted by Englis interests only, On the other hewnd, the G-rand Vizier and some few others, anxious to develope the prosSperity and secure the future defence of the empire, were favourably the English Foreign-office was given on the satne roands, and lastly, but not least, the British Ambassador recognised and appreciated the advantages which the scheme immediately offered to the wellbeing of the empire, and its probable influence on the future. In order to understand the nature of the opposition offered, and the arguments in favour of the tcheme which have finaUy prevailed, it is necessary to recall the relative position of the proposed Kostendje harbour in respect to the Danube mouths and Odessa. It should be borne in mind that Kostendje is 100 miles nearer to the Bosphorus than the Salina moutb, and 200 miles nearer than Odessa; and that moreover this portion of the Black Sea is by far the most dangerous and the most dreaded by shipowners and ship insurers. Kostendje, favoured thus by position, cannot fail to become a port of the first class, and a most dangerous rival to Odessa and the Danube ports. Already, as compared with GTalatz and Ibraila, the preference given by shippers to Odessa is represented by frora 15s. to 20s. per ton. Kostendje wiU offer advantages far superior to Odessa both as regards the safety of the harbour and position and port charges, and will thus establish a competition as fatal to Odessa as the competition of Odessa has hitherto been to Galatz and Ibraila. At the same time the corn trade of Wallachia and Moldavia, whichhas hitherto been crippled by the necessity which exists of its being carried on vid the Danube mouths, will be immensely stimulated and augmented, while the now waste Dobrudscha will renew its ancient reputation for unrivalled fertility. Whatever happens, Turkey and the Principalities must gain by the intended change. To the advantages obtained by Turkey proper there is absolutely no set-off, and the increased general prosperity of the Principalities will far more than outweigh any iDjury that may accrue to the present emporiuMs of their trasle on the Danube. Odessa alone will lose her present absolute pre-eminency in the Black Sea, and be forced t-o contend henceforth with a legitimate and powerful rivaL In a strategical point of view, the formation of a port at Kostendje will render any subsequent attack of Russia on European Turkey one of much greater difliculty, provided that the navigation of the Black Sea be open to the Turks. A camp at Kosteadje would effectually outflank and protect Silistria and would so threaten the line of the Sereth as to render the advance of the enemy into Little Wallachia hazardous in the extreme. The directors of the company in whose name the concession wil run are Messrs. Thomas Wilson, S. Cunard, Price, M.P., Paget, Lewis, Beale, M.P., and Newall. The capital of the company is fixed at 300,0001. in the first instance, of which 2 per cent. is to be deposited with the Turkish Government. The concession is for 99 years, and permit. aRl goods not the produce of Turkey being transported free in bond from the Black Sea to the Danube, and vice versOi. One-sixth of the shares bave been reserved for Turkish subjects, and it is understood that the whole number might be disposed of here, as since the scheme has been publicly discussed before the Porte the revenue it will command, if well carried out1 has been popularly estimated at a rate I am afraid to mention. Mr. Barkley, late director of the Heraclea Mines, has conducted the negotiations on the part of the company, and, in conjunction with his brother, will superintend the execution of the works in this country. SARDINIA& (PROM OU w 0 CorBRBONDT.) TURIN, MlAY 22. Her Imperial Majesty the Empress-Dowager of Russia, having left Rome yesterday morning, and embarkedatCivitaVecchiain the afternoon, arrived to-day at Genoa, where she was received by Prince Carignano and the civil and military authorities of the place, and, after a short repose there, Her Mlajesty, accompanied by Prince Oarignanlo entered the special train prepared for her, and arrived at Tarin about half-past 8 this evening. The preparations for the reception of the illUastrious visitor were on a scale suitable to herrank, and, fortunately, the weather was suificiently serene to allow ter Majesty to appreciate the display made in her honour. The whole of the long straigoht line from the Genoa Railway Station to the Royal Palace was illuminated with brilliant gaslights disposedminasuns and stars and other fancy devices, and the facades of the railway station and Palazzo Madama (the Palace of the Senate) were ornamented with variegated lamps, which, in compliment to the Empress, were disposed with some diversityof arrangement from the perpetual green, red, and white, that Piedmonteso patriotisn seems almost unconsciously to adhore to on all festive occasions. The Via Nuova, along whiclh the Imperial corw-ge passed, was decorated also with green tapestry and Russian flags hung across; and throxghout tho whole line I saw but one Sardinian emblem, and that was tho Royal arms over the railway station inl variegated lamps. Tho stroets and squaras botween the station aud tho I'alaco wero lined by the National Gnard and troops of tho garrison; and behind them thoro was a vast crowd on foot, in carriages, and in the houses oll either side, many of the latter evincing thoir welcomo by a spontaneous illumination. Shortly beforo tho arrival of the special train His lMajesty Victor Emmanuel repaired to the railwat station, which was riehly decorated iniido with tapestry, carpets1 &c.; aind thoro, surrounded by his military stafl, tho ladios and gentlemen of his household, and a deputation from tho municipality, received his Imperial gllest. As the Kuig conducted Her Majesty to the State carriago propared for her tho bands outside played the Russian National Hyimn, which was takon up by ono band after another along the lino as the Royal party passed. The cortdgc consistod of fivo state carriages, with six horses each, that containing their Majoeties being in advanc, and escorted by the General comnanding the garrison and stafl; and the whole effect as it passed slowlr down between the lines of soldiery, with Bengal lighb burning, colouri flying, and people shouting, was rreay very impoBing. At the Palace Her Majesty was received by the Princess :lotilde and the rest of the Royal Family of Savoy; tho President of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of the King's Houtehold, and several other distinguished p-rsons, being present. On the whole, the reception has been such that Her Majesty cannot but be gratified with this her first experience of the Piedmontese capital. The King, his Government the municipality, and the people have concurred in endeavouring to bid her welcome, and it is impossible that they should not have sueceedod in making their guest appreciate their greeting. The (Jpinieon of Turin has the following strange story from Pavia:- " On the 14th tho Chevalier Homodel, of this town, was on his way to an estate of his, situate in the province of Voghera (Piedmont). On arriving at the frontier, and pre. senting his passport to the Austrian commissrv, the latter informed him that he had orders to search both his carriage nd person; whereupon M. Homodei sprang from his carria3o, knocked down a soldier who attempted to step bim, and ran across the fields, tearing a letter vhtieh he had about him. He was overtaken, and several fragments of the letter were picked up by the pollee officers. On being questioned he declared that the letter containod nothing of a political nature, but only privato matters whioh lie did not wish to be known. As it was found impossible to reconnect the fragments so as to derive any proeise informa. tion from them the commissary did not arrest M. Homodoi, but exacted his word of honour that ho would present himself on the folowing day to the Imperial Delegate of Pavia, to whom the fragments of the letter would be immediately forwarded. M. Homodei fulfilled his promise, and the Delegate told him that before proceeding against him he would apply to Milan for instrUOtions. hl. Homodei, however, this time thought it best not to wait for the answer, but to mako his escape as best he might, and it is believed that he has taken refuge in Switzerland. His houro has been searched, and many books and letter. seized by the police, but it is said they are unima portant."

B QUALIZATION OF THE POOE-RATES, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-Your leading article of the 24th inst. argues very ably the claim of some London parishes for equalization of poor-rates; but there is one point which I think ought to be set right,-that is, the real.amountofpermanentpresure on the complaining parishes. I shall take the parish of St. George's-in-the-East as the head and front of the battle. The real property in this paris as assessed to the propertyg tax in 1815 was 131,0741.; it had increased in 1813 to 190,4142., or 40 per cent.; so that it is clear that up to this time its real property had not suffered any depreciation from its poor-rates or from any other cause. There is no more recent return of its real value, which has probably increased since 1843; but we may fairly assume that 190,4141. is far nearer the real rental of the parish than the 153,297T. at which it is rated to the relief of the poor. Now, the sums paid by this parish for the relief of the poor since the year 1815 have been as follows:- £ £ £ 1816 .. 10.84 1830 .. 15,145 I4 . 1. 3,2 1817 .. 11,535 1831 .. 16.181 1845 14.2 1818 .. 20,720 1832 .. 15,284 1846 14,525 1819 .. 18,851 1833 .. MS.burnt 1817 .. 16,473 1820 .. 14,052 1 .. 15,620 18 .. 19,213 1821 .. 13,502 183 = . 15.20H 1848 .. 18.472' 22 .. 4 1,612 .. 15,110 13Q0 .. 16,53r 1823 .. 9,745 1837 .. 12O,01 1851 15,025 1824 .. 10,553 181 .. 1,129 1852 14,874 jR15 .. 11,151 152 . . 12,00D 1853 19,146 13 .. 16,227 1.. . 15 1534 ' 2,4 1827 .. 12,75a 1841 .. 3.3 185- 24,2 a i82 .. 15,913 1H4O .. 14,44 185 ..UC 1823 .. 14,S;3 1.5 .. 15.7,3 ISS7 liret=e135e7 The population of the paris increased from 21,17-0 ill 1SO4, to 48,376 in 1&5, or neary L0 per cent.; so that it is clear that the percentige of poor-rates as compared with the ircrease of population, not evan excepting the years of the potato famine, has been a rapidly diminishing one. The average amount paid for the relief of the poor from 1S16 to 1S52 amounted to 14,3701, which c3alulated at its present ratiug would gie an averag rate of Is. 101d. over the whole period; but, as the rating ought not perhaps to be sufferad to hold good so fa: bock, the average ate of the 13 years ending 1X, calculated on the present parochial ratlng, wiU amount to Xs. Old. in the pound. The average rate of the same 13 years, cculated on the real property returned to the property-tAx in 1S43, will amount to is 71d. in the pound, and these include the years of the potato famine, Sinoo 1853 there has been a very great and general rise of the poor-rates in the metropolis, owing, I presume, to the pressure of tho war and war taxes; and the money speat for tho reliof of the poor, even in the much-envied parish of St. Georges, Hanover-square, was in 1853, 14,0971; in 1855, 26,9791. The monoey spent for the relief of the poor in St. George'sin-tho-East OaLeulated Calcuated on Paroebial on Propertytasx Rate. ia 1843. s. d. a. d. 1854 ... ... ... 2 11 ... 2 4 1855 ... ... ... 3 2 ... 2 6 1856 ... ... ... 3 43 ... 2 8i 1857 ... ... ... 3 4 A^ccording to the Rev. Mr. MGill's calculation. Now, it appears that somethlng under 2s. in the pound has been for a very long period the average of the money spent for the relief of the poor in St. George's-in-the-East, and that it is now suffering from a sudden and temporary premure caused by the war in oommon with all the other parishes in London. St. George's-in-the-East has snffered to the extent of ls. 4d. in the pound on its rateable property. If it complains of the 2s. in the pound, which a new andfairerrating might show to be considerably more than enough, it simply falls back on the proposition that a national rate is the oaly fair one, for there are probably very few unions in the kingdom which do not contain parishes equally burdened. The only burden that really presseson the occupiers is the rise of ls. 4d. in the pound, which I firmly believe to be temporary. I ams folly convinced that a simple manner of bringing the rate in aid clause of the 43d of Elizabeth into operation is the real plan which should be adopted to relieve parishes temporarily overburdened by poor-rates, but I do not think that the parish of St. George's-in-the-East can ehow a suffcient amount ofpressure to warrantthe adoption of such a measure. Money expended for other parochial purposes, and raised by the poor-rate, I have not taken into account. About 7,0001. per annum of such moneyis levied in St. George's-inthe-East, and about 32,0001. per annum is levied in St. Georg's, Hlanover-square; it incledes borough and policerates, valuations, &o., but isnotpartofthe moneyspentforthe relief of the poor, and does not vary much from year to year. If this be complained of, the only possible remedy is a general centralization of all rates, and the breaking up of all local management whatevor. Your most obedient servant. F. WINN KNIGHT.

ANoTEBR SUPPsED SLAvERn.-The schooner Evangelino, which has boen the past week lying off the Battery, is strongly suspected of having intended to go on a slave voyage to Africa. On Wednesday the United States' District-Attorney notified her captain of his being suspected as a slaver, and gave him instructions not to leave port until adequate bonded security was given that she was going ona legitimate voyage. All effort to obtain satisfactory security has thus far failed. Yesterday Captain Pitman, of the Evangeline, called on Mr. M'Keon, and promised that if he would allow tho vessel to proceed to sea, she would aban don her intended voyage. He did not deny that the vezsel had cleared for Africa, but rather than have her seized, or any litigation ooncerning ber ensue, he would prefer to sell the vessel at once. The District Attorney expressed no objeotion to the sale of the vessel, but before such sale took place he should insist, he said, that the contents of the schooner, which seemed to indicate her intention to go on a alave expedition, should be disposed of. The captain gave no promise as to thi8, and thus the matter 8tanda at present Tho Evangeline is a lght, though stanch schooner, of 150 tons.

GARDENS5.-Great efforts are being rande by the Horticultural Society to re-establish and increase the reputation ofLthese extensive and celebrated gardens; and from an inspection of the progress already made we have rio doubt that under the very able and energetic direction of .Mr. MvEwen, the newly appointed superintendent, they will bpeedily attain a reputation much greater than they have ever hitherto enjoyed. In many respects the gardens have assumed an entirely new and improved aspect, while the floricultural, pomological, and culinary domains are go. verned with a skil and vigour to which they have been hitherto unaccustomed. Workmen are busily engaged onx the grounds in making preparations for the exhibition, which is to take place nexte Wdnesday and Thursday. The exhibition of this year will include (for the first time) horticultural manufactures, of which there will be a large and interesting show, and to which five Parisian mauufacturei will contribute. Class A of the implements will inlude boilers, &c., of upwards of 30 differentdescriptions, belonging to 17 exhibitors. Class B will comprise pumps, syringes, mowing machines (of 30 different kinds, some of them from Scotland), and transplanting machines from Edinburgh. In dlass C, comjrsing garden tools, there wll be 12 exhibitors. Class D (cautery) includes 12 exhibitors. Of various snecinens of pottery there will be S exhibitors. Labels w.il be exhibited to great advantage in Ewing's glass w&alls and will include two of Parisian manufacture. There will be 26 exhibitors of objects of decoration, including-vases, fountain. designs, &c. of naterials for construction (including a. great variety of specimens of tent-making) there vwil be 24 exhibitors, and of protecting materials 20. Beehives of five different sorts wil be exhibited, and of philosophical instrnments, such as thermometers, &c., there will be sevgn. exhibitors. The misceUaneous wvil comprise 14 exhibitors. On the occasion of the exhibition the ro-house will be transformed into a receptacle of aquarinms. The useful implements will be exhibited in the yard, and the ornamental on the lawn and pleasure grounds. T4e Aserican garden has been very beautifully reconstructed. Its extent has been quadrupled, and a further enlargement will be made when the funds increase. One of the housts has been appropriated to the improvement of grapes, peaches, &c. The large iron conservatory is being rearranged for the purpose of being filled with a choice collection of plants during the exhibition, and there will be a broad walk down the centre of the collection. In tho culimary grounds there are now growing 100 varieties of peas and 100 different kinds of potatoes, all of them bearinu their proper labels. In the fruit grounds there is a larg collection of hardy pears, apples, and peacbes. Under the lage marquee a great variety of rose trees will be exhibit&i not as heretofore, upon stes, but in a manner entirely newr -viz., in ornamented beds, with a very pleang effect. There will be this year, for the first time, an exhibition of vegetables. Two elegant hothonses of Grecian and Gothic designs have just been oompleted, and it is intended to odnastruct about a dozen others. The approach to the gardens bas been greWtly improved by enabling carriges to driveto the large iron tent which was heretofore devoted to the ex. hibition of flowers. By the kind ermission of the Dqke of Devonshire the grounds of Chiswick-house willbethrown open to the felows of the society and their friends on Wed. nesday and Thursd%y next. Chiswick Gardens are for the future to be, to a certain extent, sef-supporting.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Iu The Timesof the l5thinst. anarticleappearednpon lighting railway carriages with gas, and, as I some months ago patented an invention which has proved succescful on several tria3s, I wil endeavour to describe the principal points in as small a space as possible, should yon consider it worthy of insertion. During the winter of 1856 the Galena and Chicago Rail. 'way, United States, had some carriages fitted with indiarubber gas-holders under each carriage, invented by Messrs. Hill and Damerest, Rochester, New York, which led me to endeavour, if possible, to introduce a system which I considered would be practicable upon English railways. Having succeeded in every point I trost to be enabled to give a general idea of the arrangement. The gasometer in made of thin wrought-iron plates, and can form part of the tender, or be a separate piece of machinery in itself; in such a form the interior of gasometer may be adapted as a supply tank to tender. I bave done away vith the ordinary balance weights and mass of water, merely requiring sufficient watcr to form an hydraulio packing-namely, one inch in breadth round gasometer in -which the gasometer works, being kept parallel by gnide rods and spring catohes, so that no motion on a railway has any effect upon the working of gasometer. Only one gasomHter is necessary for a train. The carriages merely require a permanent pipe under each, and branches to burners. The carriages are connected by flexible tubing with a simple fo-m of union-joint, and by a simple arrangement no coupling can be detached without turning off gas from the carriage. Should any strain come upon connecting pipes sufficient to break them, it at once turns gas off from the carriages detached. When carriages require to be shunted at junctions, &c., and, consequently, the connexion with gasometer broken, thelights are kept in by a simple self-acting apparatus, until again coupled to a train. An ordinary siued gasometer will hold 300 oubic feet of gas, sufficient to supply 30 lights for upwards of three hours, at a cost of abotut is. 3d. For the same number of oil lamps the cost of wick and oil alone will amount to about 4sC The light given by 5 feet of Newcastle gas is equal to 12 candles. The gasooeters can be filled at principal stations in about three minutes from small supply gasometers, which, after being filled from gasworks, are weighted to give a pressure of 12 inches of water. The working pressure of railway gasometer is from 4 to 5 inches ditto. Through the kindness of Mr. Cowan, manager of the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway, I have been enabled to prove my gasometer to the satisfaction of several engineers who were present. My endeavour has been to have but one gasometer to each train, thus to avoid the multiplicity of gas holders. I beeto remain. Sir. vrn- rnn-t nA- THOMAS J. THOMPSON. ureenwoOi.parP&, Nwry, Ireland.

The agent of Count Sch- who had been to the bank to receive a sum of 15,000 silver roubles lost the packet of notes on his way home. The money'was picked lup by a clerk, who, instead of giving the property at once to the owner, followed him to his house and inquired the name of the person who lived there. The finder of the money then returned home, hesitating in his own mind how be should act. When he arrived there a violent quarrel took place between him and his wife, the latter wishing to keep the money. The clerk, however, on the following morning, went to the house of the Count to deliver the sawn, but tae latter would not receivo it, saying that his agent had cola. unitted suicide in the night in consequence of the lo.s. Overcome with remorse, theclerkreturnedhome, where befound that during his absence his wife had hanged herself from vexation at not having kept the money.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY. LLqCOLN'S-ul X, MAY 27. EX PARTE TIE LONDON JOINT-STOOK BANR, IN RE HIOUGHTON. (Refnwp th- Trnlntq JTT.T Ptll of APPAL.1 Mr. BACON was heard in reply in this case, after which Their LORDSMPs directed it to be placed in the paper for judgment on Friday the 5th of June. The other counsel engaged were Air. Daniel, and Mr Aspland and Mr. M array, both of the common law bar. EX PARTE CARPENTER, IN RE CARPENTER. This was a petition of appeal from a decision of Mr. Commissioner Holroyd, by which he had refused the bankrupt, a publican, any certificate whatover, and all protection from arrest, by reason of which he has been imprisoned for a month or more, and now remrins in the Queen's Prison at the suit of a creditor. The grounds of e Commissioner's judgment were that a short time before the bankruptcy the bankrupt had executed a bill of sale of his furniture and fixtures to his wife's mother; but it was sworn, and not denied, that the debt to secure which the bill of sale was made was a dobt of long standing, and was pressed for before the bill of sale was executed; and further, that the wife's mother had upon the happening of the bankruptcy voluntarily resigned all benefit of the security, and moreover had been permitted, after four examinations before the Commissioner, to prove this debt against the bankrupt's estate. The second ground was, that the banlkrupt had made a false representation of his ability to give security for 5001. on reversionary property of his wife, the fact turning out to be that the wife was restrained from anticipation. The property was settled on the wife's mother, with remainder to the wife, with such restraint. The two ladies swore that they were respectively willing to have the property charged as a secrrity for the debt, and the bankrupt and the wife also swore, and it was not contra. dicted, that they both believed that he had the power to make the security. The last ground was that the bankrupt had represented that he was possessed of ready money at the time he bought a public house to an extent far greater than he really had esther in hand or could obtain. Upon this point the brnlrupt did not seem so clear, though he gave an explanation which did not appear to the Lords Justises satisfactory. In the result their Lordships recommended that the opposing creditors should consent to the bankrupt's discharge after remaining ano'her month in gaol. This the counsel for the opposing creditozs at first refused, but subsequently consented to, and Their LoRDsHIPS made the following order by consent: -After the bankrupt has remained in prison for one calendar month from this day, let the baulrnmt be discharged, and from the end of 12 months from the date of the adjudi. cation let him have a certificate of the second class, with protection from the end of a calendar month from this day. The deposib to be applied towards the costs of the opposing creditors. Mr. Roxburgh was for the appellant. Mr. BACON and Mr. BAGLEY (of the common law bar) supported the decision of the Commissioner on behalf of the opposing creditors. Lord Jnstice KNIGRT BRUCE.-Those who suppose that this Court views with anything but great disDleasure any departure from truth by a bankrut, even in the peculiar circumstances in which he Is placed with regard to tho opposing creditors in this case, are grievonsly mistaken. CAMPBELL V. XNGrBy. The Court was occupied the remainder of the day in hearing this appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls. The Attorney-General and MIr. W. D. Lewis are for the appell'nt; Mr. Bally and Mr. Nalder support the decree of the Court below.
VICE-CaANOEL,ORS' COURTS. Mtv 97 OADDThTr V_ qwmAfnI (Before Vw-Ocan&eUo Sir R. T. KINWDXPT.R1V- This case was argued in February last and reported in The Timem, his Honour on that occasion reserving his decision. The facts appear fully in the judgment. Mr. Glasse and Mr. C. HaU appeared for the plaintiff, the Attorney-General, Mr. Freeling, and Mr. Pearson for the defendant. The VICE.CHA?WELL0 now said, that this case was very complicated, bat the facts in substance were these: -Previously to 1846 the defendant and another person worked a colliery called the Satherland Colsiery, sDd adjoining to this on the north.west was another called the Tiviedale Coliery, belongin to the Messrs. Baunister. This contained 23 acres. On the south of the Tiviedale Colliery was a fault, the beds of coal being on a lower level, but a small portion of the Tiviedale Colliery, about three acres, lay on the west of the Sutherland, wbich was also on the downfall side of the fault, and was on the same level as the Sutherland, and therefore coal under those three acres would be better worked in connexion with the Sutherland than with the Tivieaale. The Sutherland had been partly worked by the dofendant and his partner, but there was a "rib" adjoiing the Tiviedale stiU unworked, as it appeared, to prevent water flowing into the Sutherland from the other mine, and this rib, being valaable, it was impossible vwithout great risk to work It by reason of the water, although there was some controversy on the paint. The defendant and his partner, being owners of the Sutherland Colliery Engines, &o., projected takiig the Tiviedale to work the rib, and a lease, dated in August, 1846, was granted of that mine to them for 21 years in consideration of 5,5001., 2,0001. down and 5001. for the first seven years, not as purchase-money, but rent, probably to give the lessor more summary rermedies. The defendatt then arranged to work and-d work three acres of the Tiviedale by means of the Sutherland works, and bored holes to let off the water. There was a controversa as to the quantity worked; but it was probable, on the evidenbo of Messrs. Mason, who worked under the defendant, that al was worked. The plaintiff lived at 'West Bromvwich, near the mines, and was a solicitor, the defendant beiog a practical miner, and the probability was that the plaintiff was legally, and the defendant practically, conversant with such matters. They were friends, and respeo ively professionally employed each other, and the defendant verbally agreed with the plaintiff for a part. nership to work the colliery. That there was some agreement was not in controversy, but the questions were as to the time, terme, and nature. The plaintiff said it was the end of 1846, the defendant, in July, 1847. The plaintiff then paid the defendant 3001., and the defendant on the 16th of July, 1847, executed another agreement with Issac Caddick (no relation of the plaintiff) and Z. Mason to grant a lease of specified beds of coal under the Tiviedale Coliery, not excepting the three acres, for 14 years for oertain terms, and this agreement was prepared by and known to the plaintiff, the defendant being treated as solely competent to deal with Caddick and Mason, as he was, on the face of the traneaction. In October, 1848. the plaintiff paid the defendant 3001. more, and in October, 1849, 2501., and at the same period the defendant made certain payments in respe.t of royalties to the plaintiff. In November, 150 the defendant sank a jackey-pit, and discovered a valuable bed of coal, varying (as appeared) from five to seven yards thick, over from three to five acres; the defendant was much gratified, but Caddick and Mason continued to work the chance coal, near the fault. On the 2d of January, 1850, an interview took place between the plaintiff and the defendant, when it was agreed that the plaintiff should retire, the defendant to pay him 2861., wbich wes paid. In May, 1852, Caddick and Mason began to work the newly discovered coal, and in October, 1853, agreed in writing to give up seven acres to the defendant out of 23 acres of the Tiviedale Colliery, and the defen'4ant in the same month agre^d to sell all his interest in the two collieries, to Messrs. Radley and Hopkins for 9,7001., 1,000. for the Sutherland, and 8,700h. for the Tiviedale, and, on the 9th of December, 1853, the defendant exeouted the conveyance. The plaintiff insisted that by the agreement of 1846 he was entitled to a moiety of the Tiviedale Colliery except three acres on the downf .11 side of the fault, to a moiety of the profits, and that the agreement of January, 1852, for his retirement was obtained by fraud, it being falsely represented as a losing concern, and that the defendant did not inform the plaintiff of the discovery bf the new seam of valuable coal, and that the plaintiff was entitled to au account of royalties' profits, and a mnoiety on the balanco of such accounts. The bill, therefore, was to set aside the agreement of January, 1852, en the ground of fraud, and for specifio performance of that of 1846, auidit was apparent that unless the agreement of Jnuar, 1852, could be set aside for fraud, it was unnecessary to go into the question of partnership, and the plaintiff oould not succeed in this suit. It was moat convenient first to try the question of specific performance. Sapposing there Was no agreement for a dissolutionx and no sale by the defendant, wouldtis Court dere-especificperformas4ee? It was a clear rule, on the question of specific performassce that the agrment must be clearly alleged by the hb1ri,a& 'the plaintiff could not allege one agreement by the bill; asd ask performance of another, even though that other existed; that the agreement, if not admitted by the defen dant, must be conclusively proved by the paintiff, and must be oonuplete and perfect in all material terms; If It was uncertain and ambiguous no decree could be made. His Honour then proceeded to consider in detail the allegations and affidhvits on both sidos, and the defendant's answer and expressed his opinion to be that the agreement sought to be perforrmud was not sufficiently alleged by the bill, though curiously enough the defendant did refer to it. but said that it was to be carried out by deed, but never was. There was noagreement alleged as to ownership, but merely as to the working. There was s,othing about a share, payment, or- duration, and only as to part by inference; and the plaintiff, by amendnit, aLleging an exceptioh of the three acres, that was deniedby the defendant, but he did not venture to swear that baegave all the information he possessed as to the discovered coal; therefore, although the bill must be dismnissed, it mulst be w7ithout costs. FITZ¶VMLLAS5S V. LONG. This was a suit for the administration of the estate of the notorious Mr. St. John Long the principal part of which was derived frota the sale of his secret for rubbing patients, which realized 10,0001. Inquiries had been directed as to his children, all of whom, reside in Canada, but a difficulty arose in filing one of the affidavits sworn before a Master in Chancery in that colony, by reason of the jurat not being In the form required in England. Mr. W7ARE applied to the Court for permission to file the affidavi, notwithstanding the irregularity of the jurat. theThaeppVscx-.CaecEros7, under the circtmstances, granted (Before Vce-Chancltor Sir J. STUAlsT.) WRIGIET V. SANDARS. Thi was a bill by the personal represeftative of a surety toa bend, praying that it uaight be declared that the tiff, a such represeutative, was not sabject to any babilitycn respc of the bon.ich On the dissolution of the hpartnershp betwee Messrs. Saudars and Haywood,' who hadcariedon usiesstogether in patnership aas -~ mongers at Dry Mr. Hawood and te late Mr. Ralph Frost, as the e r. Hawood. entered into a joitt and everal b, date ed the 15th of February, 1831, a fo seuigthe asyment six months after that periocd to MKr. anasof the sum of 5,0001., being a portion of the balanoe orsuna of 7,9601. which on the taking of'the pakrtneir. ship aocounts between Mr. Sandars and Mr. Haywood had been found to be due to the former. By an agremenit in writing, dated the 21st of Februar, I1831, and signe by, Sandars and Haywood, but without the privity or Consent of Mr. Prcst, Sandars and Haywood agreed that the entir sum of 7,9601, due from the latter to th former should be paid as follows-viz., that 1,0001. should he paid witE;n a year from that date, and theresidue within the followink five years by equal half yearly payments, with interest at Ui. per cent. per annum half-yearly. In May, 1848, Mir. Frost died intestate, and letters of administ,tiomn of his estate and effects had been granted to the plaintiff In May, 1855, Haywood was adjudged a bankruPt, and in February last Sandas commenced an action at law on the bond against the plaintiff as the personal representative of Frost. The bill, in addition to praying that the plaintiff might be relieved from ad liability in respect of the bond, also prayed for an injunction restraining the proceedings at law. Upon the motion for an injunction comnng on, the plaintiff undertook to allow the defendant to enter up judgment against him in the action, the defendant also undertaking to allow such judgment to be dedt with by this Court as it should think fit. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bazalgette appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Wigram and Mr. Bobblouse for the defendant. The VxcF-CCHANncEsOR, after reviewing at considerable length the facts of the case and the authorities cited in the argument, said that he thought the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the rule that whatever a creditor did to alter, injure, modify, or affect the rights of a surety should operate as a discharge of the surety's liability. It was impossible to say that the position of frost was not altered or prejudiced by the written agreement of the 21st of February, 1831, so that -his obligation by suretiship was released. On the whole case he thought that the injunction should be made perpetual, and that Sandars should be directed to enter satisfaction of the bond as against the estate of Frost, and also to pay the costs of the sait. (Before Vicesanceior Sir W. P. WOOD.) BOSVILA V. LORD MIDDLETON. The object of this suit is to set aside a deed executed by the plaintiff in 1848, and to obtain a declaration that his consent to the insertion in a private Act of Parliament, passed in 1847, of certain clauses mnateriasly affecting his position with respect to the estates thereby dealt writh, was wrongfully obtained from him, and that he ought to be relieved from the consequences of his consent so given. The case not being fully opened we reserve any further statement. The ATon y_-GREmRAL (with whom is M1r. Clement Swanston) was heard on behalf of the plaintiff.
I COURT OF QUESNS BENCH. WESTXSTEIR. MAV 97 1 QUEEN (ON THE PMR)SECUTION OF THE GUARDIANS OF THE POOR OF OxIORD) V. TEE VICE-CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD. tSWings fn Banco, befoe roid CMlPBELL an4 JrUnces COLERDGE, ERIE, ancd CROMPTON.) This was a special cuse stated for the opinion of this Court, under the powers of a local Act of Parlianent, the 17th and 18th of Victoria, for regulating the poor within the city of Oxford, and for rating certain hereditaments in the University. The question raised was, whether the University was liable to be rated to the relief of the poor in respect of the foLlowing buildings and land .-L The Bodleian Library; 2. The Divinity and other schools; 3.. The Convocation-house; 4. The old Convocation-house and Law School; 5. The Sheldonian Theatre ; 6. The Ash. molean Museam; 7. The Clarendon-buildings; 8. The Botanic Gardens; 9. The Taylor Inetitation; 10. The University Galleries; 1L The College chapels; 12. The College libraries. All these buildings and land were situat within the city of Oxford poor-law union; and, with the exception of the college chapels and librarie-, they were the property of the University. Members of the University paid certdn fees anoaaly, some also at matriculation, before examinations, and on each graduation. The moneys so levied were applied to the maintenance of the police, the keeping up of the public walks, the defence of property, the extinction of fire, tho Bodleian Library, and the payment of its officers. The University and colleges claimed to be exempt from rateability in respect of all these buildings and land upon the ground that there was no beneficial occupation. The guardians, on the other hand, contended that the University or colleges occupied most of the buildings and land by their servants, or their furniture, or books, and all of them by their scholars and members, and, therefore, that they were rateable as beneficial occupiers within the 43d of Elizabeth, chap. 2. The case stated that the Bodleian Library was first founded by Humphrey, Duke of Glocester, A.D. 1480; but becoming much decayed, it was restored and enlarged. by Sir Thomas Bodley, Xt., A.D. 160& The quadrangular part of the bu;idingn, known as " the Schools," was erected soon after this. The present library consists of the upper stories of the Schools quadrangle, with one room on the ground floor and the room over the Divinity School and the Convocation-house. The library is regulated according to statutes made from time to time by the University in convocation, and by them the management is vested in eight cx officio curators. There is a librarian, elected by the University in convocation, and he appoints two sub-librarians and several asistants, subject in the former case to approval by the curators and convocation, and in the latter by the curators only. All Bachelors of Arts and persons of superior degrees in the University have by the present statutes free access to the library. Under-graduate members of thelUniversity and strangers are aJso admitted for the purposes of study, and without any payment. It is one of the libraries entitled by statute to receive a copy of every book entered at SUationers. balL There is an endowment sufficient for the repahrs, and books are purchased and the salaries of officers are paid out of the general funds which arise from endowments of considerable value, and in part from fees imposed on all the members on matriculation and annually afterwards, and also the fee on all degrees A jamitor appointed by the head librarian, and who is his servant and removable by him, attends daily in that part of the library known as " the Picture Gallery," and conducts straDgers over it and the library, for whichhe generally receives a gratuity. The librarian is bound by statute to pay the janitor 201. ayear out of his salary. The janitor also prints and sells for his own benefit catalogues of the pictures. No son sleeps in or occupies any part of the library as a dwelliii-house, aud the University derives no pecniay benefit from ito 2a "The Divinity School" was uilton land purchased by the University, An. 1426; theother"schools"'abouttheyear1613. In these "'schools" the regular pablic examinatios of members previous to the B.A. degree are now conducted and in some of them, such as the divinity and music schools, exercises are performed by the candidates for degrees. The iebrio of the " schools' is anpported by henefactions granted by Queen Mary, and the University derives no pecuniary prefit from the use of any of the schools; but all candidates for examinatiov are required to enter their names with one of the proctors, and to pay certain fees, which go towards the stipend of the examiners Ai "clerk of schools," appointed by the University, has charge of the keys, and he allows another person to show the schools and to receive a gratuity for so doing. AUl the expenses of "the schools" are paid by the Univerity, but no one sleeps in or occupies anypartot themas adwelling-house. 3. "TheConvocation. house" consists of two rooms, comununicating with one another. Thu inner room is used for conferring degrees, on which occasion the usual fees are paid, and go to the University; and here, also, is transacted the other business which is brought before Convocation. The outer room is called " The Apodyterium," and in it the fees above-mentioned are paid; it is also used as the " University Court," for the recovery of debts and demands, in respect of which fees are payable to the proctors of the court, who alone are allowed to practise there, and who must be members of the University. 4. " The old Convocation-house and Law School." This was formerly the chancel of St. Mary's Church, and was used as a convocation. house until the present Convocation-honse was built. It is now little used. It consists of two rooms, in thelower of which the University fire-engine is kept. The upper room has been used for the delivery of lectures in law by the Universit profes3ors, and itis now also used as a lecture- room by the Professor of Latin, vho receives a fee of 11. for' each course from every oue who attends. The University receives no rent or profit from it. 56 " The Sheldonian - Theatre." This building is chieflyused forthe meetingof convocation on the occasion of the annual commemoration, when a public oration is delivered, and prize essays and poems are read and recited. It is also used at; other times, when. the attendance of members of convocation is too large for their accommodation in the Convocation-house. Concerts are sometimes allowed to be given in it by express permission of the curators at the time of the annual commemoration, and once at another time - and for admissionto such concerts tickets are publicly soid, but no profit has ever accrued, or by the arrangementscould have accraed, to - the University from such concerts. Graduates in music have occasionally been permitted to perform their exercises - here instead of in the statutable place in the music sohool when they have chosen, at their own cost, to employ a larger number of performers tban the statute requiree. In respect of musical degrees, fees are paid to the University. The degree is not conferrod in the "Theatre," but in "The Convocation-house," and no pecuniary profits of any kdnd are derived by the University from the te of the room on any occasion. Under the Theatre is a lage room, or cellar, formerly used as a place of deposit of books of the Univerdity brought down from the Clarendon press, but it Is now occupied by only some of the old stock of books, and by volumes belonging to an eminent Oxford publisher who has charge of books of the University, and who has used the cellar as a place of deposit for some of his own books also, but without paying rent for it. A servant has of late beenappointed at an annual salary to attend at the*: Theatre for the convenience of-strangers, -from whom he occasionally receives a gratuity. The building is entitely supported by estates given for the purpose by, the founder. 6. "The Ashmnolean Museum.," This buildirg consist of two parts. The basement> contains a laboratory and rooms occupied as a residence by the reader in mineralogy, who has for some. years paid rates. The upper part is used as a museum, and has a separate entrance, and no internal communication with the basement. Mlembers of the University are admitted witbout payment; but there is a notice exhibited that' "a fee of 6d. each is required from all other persons visiting the Museum." This is strictly a gratuity to the attend ant, and no pecuniary profit to the Universi. The rooms of the Museum are also occaTionall us rine term-time by the members of a literary society, cal4et: "the Ashmolean Society," which is not limited -io the members of the University, and is supported by voluntary contributions. No one sleeps In the museum, and the University derives no pecuniary profit from any part of the building. 7. "The Clarendon-buald. inge) Here the piinting busineM of the University wa formerly carried on; but now, onL the basement, wre the Univesity police-rooms' above are four rooms, n one of which the Hebdomadal (oundl meets, and another subsi. diary to it; ink a -third the magiterial businees of the University is conducted, and the foulrth is used by the registrar of the University, The rooms on the upper storyare used by varions University professorst, some of hom reoeivefees from those who attend the lectumez One room is devoted to geological speoiuens, and free admittaneeis permittd to members of the University and persons introduced by them; but " a fee of 6d. each is required of all other persona." This fee is a gratnity to the attendant, and no pecuniary advantage to the University or to the readers of mineralogy or&eolcgy. These buldings were assessed to the poor.rate, vhflo the printing was carried on there, and had so con. tinned to be charged ever since. 8. Tho " Botanic Garden." -Thiswas founded bytheEsrlof Danby, A.D., 1672, and is entirely devoted to the cultivation of choice trees and medicinal and other plauts, for the promotion of the science of botany; it is supported out of tho rents of an estate and an annual payment made out of the funds of the University. The professorhasahouse of residence, in which ho delivers lectures, and receives afee of ll.for a course from each person who attends. Thepublicin general are admitted to the gardens and the collections of books and herbarium free from charge; but not to the conservatories and store. houses, where an entrance fee of Is. is charged for the benefit of the gardener, and not of the University or pro. fessor. The professor's house and the Botanic Gardenw ere separately rated to the relief of the poor from the year 1845 to the year 1854, but no rate has beer; levied since, in consequence of the new Act. 9. "The Taylor Institution.,, This building was erected afew years since by the University, out of moneys bequeathed by Sir Robert Taylor, " for establishing a foundation for the teaching and im proving the European languages, in such manner as should from tire to time be approved by the said chan. cellor and scholars in convocation." It contains a library, several lecture-rooms, apartments in which a librarian resides, &c. The teaching during term-time is gratuitous, and open to all meombers of the University. Rhe teachers mas teach in private, but not in the Taylorbuilding. The librarian, with his family and servants, reside within the building. All the expenses of the institution e defrayed by the University out of funds left by Sir Robert Taylor, and the University derives no pecunlry profit from the institution. 10. " The University Galleries."Theseadjoin the TaylorInstituion, andform part of it externally. They were erected partly by a bequest for tho purpose, but almost entirely by the Uniersity. They contain paintings, sculptare, and other worksof art. Three curators appointed by the University make rules for the admission of vmitors, &c., onl'. The keeper and hic servant reside in the building. The jeeper is paid by the University, and seUs a catalogue for his own benefit, and the University has no direct benefit from them. IL < The CoUege Chapels." These are situate within the walls, and form par of the colleges to which they belong. They are all consecrated buildings, in which the Sacraments and other publc offices of the church are celebrated, and are placs for publio religious worship specified in the Acts of Uniformity. Practically, the congregations consist for the most part, or Wholly, of members of the respective colleges. The chapels are only accessible through the outer gates of the colleges. Mfembers of a college are expected to attend chapel, and the attendance there forms a part of their regular duties. 12. "The College Libraries." These are buildings within the walls of tho respective colleges, containing books and MSS., and yield no pecuniary profit. They are maintained in some cases by endowments, in some by fees, in someeby grants from the college, and in some from more than one of these sources. The above is a brief outline of the facts as stated in the case for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether the University had such a beneficial occupation in the whole, or any part of the said buildings, as would mske it liable to be assessed to the poor-rate. Mr. PASHLEY, QC. (With whom was Mr. Tomlinson) on the part of the guardians, contendee that the University bad a beneficial occupation, and that, even in those cases where it was found that the University had derived no direct pecuniary benefit, there was abenefit arising from the occupation of the land and buildings, which brought the University within the statute of Elizabeth. Mr. MEATING, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Welsby), on the part of the University, contended that there was no bane. Cial occupation, inasmuch as the buildings belonged to a great national institution established for public purposes, and no pecuniary or personal profit was derived from the Cocupation. He contended that the case came within those decisions in which it had been held that institutions established for public charitable, religious, and educational purposes were exempt. With respect to some of the buildings which the learned counsel thought could not be brought Within the cases, such as the college libraries, &c., the learned counsel seemed to admit the University must be held rateable, as it was admitted the colleges were, for the balls, common rooms, and other apartments occupied by the members, fellows, &c. Lord CAMPBELL said the Court would take time to consider before deciding a question on which there was no appeal, the Legisture having empowered this Court, with the consent of both sides, finally to determine the difference which had arisen between them. EX PARTE BAEEt. Mr. ScorTLD moved for a writ of haas cor-pus to b,dng up the body of William Baker, a prisoner in Stafford gaol, with a view to his discharge from custody, on the grounld that he had been committed by the magistrates without .uriction. The prisoner had been convicted under the sters and Servants Act (the 4th of George IV., chap. 4, sec. 3), for absenting himself from his master's employ without leave and without notice, and without suffiient reason. On the expiration of his sentence he went into the employ of another master; but his first service being anexpired, he was called upon to return to the service of his former master. He refused to do so, and was again summoned before the magistrates, and agmin committed for one month. The learned counsel contended that the magistrates had no jurisdiction to commit the servant a second time. If the servant had returned to his first service he might have been committed a second time for absenting himself from his service, but he could not become guilty of. a fresh offence of absenting himself every time he was called upon to return and refused. Lord CatLPBELL said, the Court ought to take care that convictions were according to law, but at the same time they ought not to allowv the law to be evaded by subterfuges. Looking at the laguiuge of the commitment, the Court thought there was a fresh offeuce when the prisoner was liberated, and refused to retutrn to his service. The other judges were of the same opinion. application refused. BAIL COURT. (Szttings at Misi Prius, before Mr. Jusice WIGHTVAN.) BERRDaGE AND WIFE V. COLLINS. Mr. Knowles and Mr. Atkinson were counsel for the plaintiffs; -Mr. Locke for the defendant. This was an action for negligent driving. The plaintiff and his wife were going along in their pony cart, when, acording to the jplainti& case, the defendant's servant drove his cart against them, in consequence of which the plaintif's wife was thrown out of the cart, and was very much injured. The defence was that the plaintiff alone was to blame. Many witnesses were called on each side, and as is usual in such cases, they contradicte4 each other. The jury retired for some time, and then gave a verdict for the defendant.
COURT OF COMMON PIPRAS. WEsTxsTE1L WI.Y 27. GLYD1E V. THF OPCIAL MANAGER OF THIE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH COPA,V nP T>TT. (Sitings in Banco, 2rinity Term.) The Conrt to-day was occupied with a long argument on the validity of an award, of no interest whatever to any but the parties concerned. (SiUngs at N(iw Prtua, at Westmtinskr, before Mr. Jwtuice CROWDER and a Common Jdnrv\ Mr. Couch was counnel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. H. James appeared for the defendant. This was an action to recover compensation for services rendered to the companyby the wife of th plaintiif The plaintiff's case, as disclosed by his own and his wife's evidence, was that in June, 1852, while he was assisting Mr. Henry Maybew, the author of London Labour and London Poor, he was applied to by the company to enter into their service, and in December he went, with his wife, to Belfast, where the defendants had an office His duties at first consisted in laying the wires through Belfast, but he was fterwards called away to lay the cable between D bhadee and Port Patrick. His wife's services were theutSl'ired at the offlce, and she entered into an agreement wts Tr. Massey, a director, since dead, to superintend it for. 1per week. Her attendance at the office was required from 8 o'clock in the morning tiUl 7 in the evening, and she discharged the duties required of her in transmitting messages, &c., from May, 1853, tiU January, 1865. It also appeared that she was to have 51. for every pupil whom she instructed in working the telegraph. It was elicited on cross-examination that, although the wife had applied to Mr. Massey, no claim had been made upon the company till after his death; that the plaintiff had brought an action against the company (which it appeared had como under the rovsions of the Winding.np Act), and had recovered a tZge sum of money for a. variety of items mixed up with theoffice business, amongewhich was one for 5L forhis vwfe's instruction. to a pupil; but that he made no claim for the 1, per week. The defence was that the demand now brought forward was fictitious, and that it was made out by alleged conversations with a dead man. A number of letters were put in written b7 the plaintiff after the date of the agreement with his wife, in which letters be asked whether anything was to be-allowod for her rervicsm in looldng after the offloe ; and it was urge; that their contents were inconsistent with the existerce of the agreement setup. A Mr. Gilpin, a contractor, was caDled, and he admittid that in May, 1853, he had written to the plaintiff; stating that of course the company must pay for the saperintendence of the office, but that he hoped to be over soon to arrange it, and that Mfr. Massey and another gentleman attended to such matters. He further deposed that although he often saw both the plaintiff and his wife in 1852, the 11. a-weekagreement was never onoe mentioned. He also denied tlaa conversaUion relied on by the plaintiff had taken The learned JUDGE carefully summed up the evidence, and-let it to the jury to say whether written documents, which could not deceive, na other evidence, did not outweigh the testimony of the plaintiffand his wife.

POLlIO. SOUTRWAM-11.en Webb, 25, hAwker; Michael Hovrard, 20, porter; omas Cook, 21, potman; Ann Tobin, 26, and Catharine Brown, 18, were brought before Mr. ScKER, charged with committing a desperate garotte robbery in Dviney-place, Soathwark, and nearly murdering ir. Saul Lwrene, a clerk, of 36, Mitre.street, Aldgate, whose face was literally covered with bruises, and who could hardlyarticulate from the injuryinffictedon his throat, stated that about 8 o'clock on the previous evening he came over Blackfriarsbridge, when he met two men, who asked him to treat themr. heconsented, and accompanied them to a publichouse in the Mint. As soon as they entered two other men came in, and they seemed to know each other. After that the two women came in, and he treated them alt to what they liked to drink, They did not sit down, but stood under a kind of shed. Mfr. SECRI asked him to look round and see whether any of those persons be treatd were in court ? Prosecutor (pointini to the doclk) said,he thought he conud swear to Cook, We b, and the two women. The two men he believed to be those he met near Blackfriars.bridge. After he had treatea them for some time Brown asked him to go home with her, which he refused. He had at that time in his posession two watches, a gold chain, and 13& in gold, besdes a gold ring on his finger, Finding that he had had enough to drink-, and wishing to get rid of the company, he left the premises. At that time Brown kept hold of his arm, and as soon as he got out some one suddenly seized him tightly by the throat from behind, nearly strangling him. He then heard the voices of several men, and he struggled very hard for more than five minutes. Some one then strack him a heavy blow on the head, and he then became insensible. Sergeant Turpin said, that if the prisoners were remanded he belived he should be able to obtain further evidence against them, and apprehend another party oonnected with the outrage and robbery. Mr. SECKma accordingly remanded them. IA=LVnL-Franoes Boldlng was placed at the bar before Mr. ELLIOTT on a charge of plundering her master, Mr. Joseeh Buastead, an examiner of banknotes in the Bank of tsgland. Mrs. 1len Ann Bumnsted, the wife of the prosecutor, wbho reides in Holland-street, Brixton, deposed that the prisoner had lived in her service for about six weeks, and uring that time and up to SaturdT last she hadno fault to find with her. On that evemng, however, she absconded, and soon after she (witness) missed a quantity of linen, which the prisoner had been employed, on a part of that day, in ironing, together with a 5&. note, seven sovereigns, a halfsovereign, and 2s. 6d. in silver, which had been taken from a drawer in her bedroom. On a further search sho had also missed a silk mantle and a pair of boots belonging to her daughter, and the latter the prisoner had on when she was taken into custody. The other things missed were now produced by the constable, who found them in the prisoner's possession. There Wsu also produced a heart-shaped locket which she (witness) had missed about a fortnight ago; she had spoken to the prisoner about itatthetime, but she denied all Inowledge of it, and declared she had not seen it. Sergeant Standage said, that on the evening before, in consequence of information he received, he went to the bouse No. 17, Pitt-street, Old Kent-road, and, seeing the prisoner there, told her she must consider herself his prisoner on a charge of robbing her master. She began crq mg, and said shis was very sorry for what she had done,-- that she had brought it all on herself, and that she was going to start on the followin day by the lorth-Western Railway for LiverpooL She further said that from Liverpool she was going to New York with some other Mopmons on their way to the Salt Lake settlement. S4e then handed him a pur belonging to her mistress contaig- ing three sovereigns and 10s. 6d. in silver, and sad that w*s I all she had left of the money; that she pid 61 7s. 9d. for her pssage and purchased some articles she required. On sching the lace he (Standage) found all the propertz he, produced, and the prisoner acknowledged it belongecs to her master and mistrees. Sineo apprehending the pribon4r he said he had called on Mr. Rudge, 35, Jewin-street, city, who is the 3formonites agent in London, and received from that peson 5L 7s. 9d., which the prisoner had paid to him for her passage to New York. Mr. Bunisted, the prosecutor, had some private conversation with the magistrate, and wished to have the cae dealt with at once under the Criminal Jurisdiction Act, thinki;ig the punishment his worship could inflict would meet the jstice of the cae. The prisoner, when asked wrhat she had to say, repUed she had nothing to offer fci what she had been gnuilty of. 3ir. Eu.rocr considered the offence of too senous a natute to be summarily dis&osed of, and, besides, the crime of robbery by servants was becoming so prevalent tkat it was necessary to make examples in such cas Addressing the prisoner, his worship aid,-From what I hear, yqu. appear to be the victim of a set of wretched and deluded people who are allowed to live in a vicious, wicked, and unmoral state in a part of America, and I trust that you ll relsect upon the serious consequences and te degrading position that you have p laced yourself inb listening to such evil, wicked, and profiEgate advisers as those who, doubtless, led you tO commit your preseqt The prnsoner was fully committed for triaL.

FATAL ACCIDENT AT SnoBnoN CouRT.-Shobdon Court, Herefordshire, the seat of Lord Bateman, has been the scene of a terrible catastrophe, which haz thrown qoft. a gloom over the district. A number of workmen a been employed for some lime pest in making extensive alterations end enlargements on the premises. Among the alterations were some extensive arches, which were being constracted underneath the mansion, ani as a number of workmen-masons carpenters, and others-were employed on these on Monday last an arch just oompleted, and which had been built upon old foundations, gave way, burying the workmen in the rmins. Information was immediately conveyed to the nearest town (Leominster), where the families of many of the men employed redide, and it being staed that four men were killed, and that several others were seriously injured, the greatest oonsernation prevailed, and the extent of the injury to life was uot generally known until Tuesday. It was then ascertained that two men jnamed Edward lFlis and Thomas Jones had been killed, and that four others were severely injured. The names of the injured men are Mr. Winch, the foreman of the crpenters, Richard Evans, Edwrad Morris, George Shore, William Bruce, and another, name unknown. A considerable time elapsed before the full extent of the catastrophe oould be ascertained, as the injured 7men were buried beneath a mans of heavy masery, which it took Dome time to remove. In the meantime the groasof the poor fellows were piteous in the extreme. Every aid was rendered by tho inmates of zhe oourt, and the Hon. and Rev. A. Hanbmy partieulry exerted himxelf.

FL?WSVBKDORS' BENEVOLENT AND PRO r. DBNT INSTITUTION. The l5thanniversary of thin society, the object of which is me granting of pensiorns atLd temporary relief to isdigei e naters and servants engaged in the zale of newspapers, v {a telebrated at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen-st-teet, lant evening. The festival wa prsided ovor by Mr. John Walter, M.P., who was 8upported by the leading mnembers of the trade aud a compaUy numbering about 15a gentlemen. The occasion was also honoured by the rrsence of groups of ladies. The finances of the society ame in a flourishing state, and a portion of th& have been dis.- bussed in affording timely (kid to the Tcessitous. After the repast the usual loyal thasts were duly give 7rom the chair cnd cordially rosponmid to by the assembly. The CsXs-tN, in proph, ng "'The Army and Navy," remarked that they were ill extraziely prond of the lvurels 'won byour brave defendrs, botli by sea and land; but there was a community of iitest between those services u,nd the trades represeated at that board. The army and navY would bhavelittle incentive to the achievement of greAt 'deeds if there were mo newevendors to spread the fame of those deeds through the woirld. (Cheers.) One portion of the trade, which he b&ieved was not represented 'that night, but which N7as generaly knowns by the mame of "the rearing vagalaonde" a laugh), seemed tasuppose that fthe army and navy ha been created for 'their especial benefit (rearwed laughter) because during the vhole of the late war it was imposshbleto geta quiet hour in 'his part of'thetownfroisthe extreme enthusiasmevinoed by this fraternity in daily pzoclaiming the achievements of these gallant services. (Lawlhter.) Wbatever mistakes might bave' occasionally marked the stentorian announcements of this enterprising class, he wassure that whenever the army .and navy were again called upon to distinguish themselves the newsvendors of London would be delighted to give publicity to'the records*of their prowess and heroism. {Cheers.) The toast was drunk amid loud applause. The CTIAIRMUr., in introducing the toast of the evening, observed that the principle of combination was one of the 'most deeplyrooted qualities of the human mind, and would always exist in one formor another. If it did not take a -good direction-it was pretty sure to take a bad one. Most of them remembered the period when the spirit of combination was widely exhibited in a very disagreeable and unamiable fashion. He alluded to the time of the Trades' Unions, when masters on the one side and servants on the other were arrayed against each other in the strongest -antagonism. Oif late years, however, whether owing to the grater diffusion of common sense among all classes, or, as hehoped, to the greater dissemination of a Christian and charitable spirit, a happier state of things prevailed. CombI)inations now assumed a more benignant and friendly aspect, and society reaped a corresponding benefit. Benevolent institutions, representing almost every trade in the kingdom, had sprung up on all sides; and no doubt they would-see the present society, which he regarded as only yet in its infancy, becoming widely ramified through the country in due course and extending its branches in every quarter. (Cheers.) There was something remarkableit might almost be said mysterious-in the way the intel lectual food of the community was daily provided. loreigners and friends from the country often wondered how the physical wants of a vast city ilike London could be regularly supplied; and it was only by passing the baker's shop in the middle of the night and observing the underground operations then going on there, or by notlcing the waggon loads of cabbages piled as high as that room on their way to Covent-garden at 4 o'clock in the morning (laughter) that such persons could gain a faint idea of the meode in which the Londoners got their bread, meat, and vegetables. The intellectual food of the community was -supplied ma similarly mysterious manner; and most people knew nothing of the occult processes which reaulted in the anpearance of their newspapers on their breakfast table. (Hear, hear.) One class of traders who ministered to the -comforts of the people were caUed licensed victuallers. By an analogous nomenclature newsvendors migbt be -termcd " the unlicensed inteUeetual victuallers" of the country, supplying as they did its daily mental aliment. (Cheers.) Indeed, society would find itself exceedingly embar. rassed and could not get on at all without the services of so useful a class of caterers. (Hear, hear.) He had not had an opportunity of examining the report of the Newavendors' Benevolent Institution for that year, but he had looked into -the report of the year before, and he was sorry to say he did not find it quite so encouraging as he could desire. He trusted, however,thatthe resultof that evening would enable them, when they next published a statement of theirposition, to furnish something more satisfactory. (Cheers.) As near as he could calculate what he might call their working expenses, they amounted to about 40 per cent. of their entire receipts. This was far too large a proportion (hear, hear), and a society in which such a state of things existed could not be deemed self-supporting. Let them endeavour, then, as far as possible to reverse these proportions. (Cheers.) The hon. gentleman concluded by proposing "Prosperity to.the Newavendors' Benevolent and Provident Institution." The toast was drunk with much enthusiasm. The Secretary then read a list of donations in aid of the funds, which was headed by Mr. Walter, 251. ; Messrs. W. H. Smith and Son, 101. l0s.; Mr. J. C. M'Donald, 51. 5s. ; atessrs. Dawson and Son, 51. ; Baron llothschild, 51., dw. The total sum collected during the evening ainounted to about 100l. Mr. WILD, the chairman of the committee, proposed "The health of Mr. Charles Dickens " the preAident of the institution, and expressed his hope that the state of their finances would before long enable them to provide alms. houses as well as small pensions for the objects of their bounty. Mr. TERRY (the treasurer), in very complimentary terms, gave "TThe health of Mr. Walter," eulogizing that gentle' man's exertions in expediting the publication of VTe 1Tinvs so as to enable the newsvenders to serve their castomers in due time. (The toast was received with enthusiasm). 'The CHAIR)IAN, in returning thanks, said he was con. vinced, from the difficulties with which the newavenders had to contend, that their task was no light or easy one. What between the public wbo must he supplied, and the newspaper publisher who could not print his impression last enough, the poor newvsvender was, as it were, in a vice, where he was pretty well squee7ed, and had very much of a dog's life of it. (Cheers and laughter.) He had taken consi-derable pains to obviate the complaints of indignant subsori. bars, who complained bitterly that they did not receive their papers till mid-day, forgetting all the time that the fault perhaps lay with some prosy orator in thb E[ouse of Commons. who protrActed the debate beyond 2 o'clock in the morning, and thus delayed the newspapers getting to press. ("1 Rear, hear," and a laugh.) Ie boped, however, bv the application of additional power to the printing process, to accomplish before many montbs elapsed that wbich it must be owned was no easy achievement-namely, to please every. body. (Lanvhter.) " The health of the Donors" was next given, to which Mr. J. C. 5l'DONAI D briefly responded, forcibly pointing out the consolation which the newsvender might derive in the midst of the daily vexations to which he was exposed, and 'earnestly counselling the members of the trade to bear and forbear with each other. Twelve o'clock having arrived, The CIIAIRsairN excused himself from further attendance, on the ground that it was time to think about " going to press," otherwise their country friends might not receive their newspapers with due punctuality in the mornig. (Cbeers and laughter.) " The Press' and a few other toasts were also drank, and 9tbe party separated at a late hour. The musical arrangements were under the direction of Mr. Smythson, assisted by Miss Jane Wells, Mr. D. K3ing, hr. Lawler. and Mr. Genge, who contributed greatly to the <enlivenment of the evening. Mr. B. Banks, jun., acted as toastmaster,
