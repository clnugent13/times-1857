2fONBY-lMARBKT and OITYINTBL.LIGBNOB. Saturday Evening. The discontinuance of the savings-banks parchases of Exchequer-bils caused the funds to open heavily this morning at a decline of more than an eighth, but a recovery subsequently took place, and the market closed with a firm appearance. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93O, were first quoted 93k to g. Some speculative purchases, believed to be on behalf of Greek firms who had lately been operating on the adverse side, then c used an improvement, and, notwithstanding a rather considerable sale of stock for delivery, the final iransactions were at 938 to ;. For the new account on the 9th of July the closing price was 944 to 0 (or 93 to e ex. dividend); Bank Stock left off tt 212 to 214; Reduced, 92i to i; New Three ptr Cent¢., 92k to j ; India Stock, 221 to 223; India Bends, 7s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 38i to 99; and Exchequer-bills, June, is. to 3s. pr( mium; Marcb, 4s. to 6s. premium. The demand for money was not great either in the Stock-Exchange or the discount-market, but this is usua'ly the case on Saturdays. The operations in foreign securities were limited, lut pricts were well supported. There was an ab- ence of business in Turkish, and the other bargains comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98 ; Buenos Ayres Six per Cents., 87i; New Granada, Active, 224 ; the Deferred, 6i; Mexican, for moncy, 227s for the account, 23A; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97k; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 42k; andAVeneziela Deferred, 14. The final quotations of the French Three per Cenits. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 4Cc. for money, and 69f. 35c. for the account, showin g a further improvement of an eighth. The La 111ogue has arrived from Sydney with 4,356 oz. of gold and 100 sovereigns, making a total of 17,5241. It is now stated that the steamer Indus, from Southampton on the 4th of June, will take out about 800,0001. in bar silver, 5f.-pieces, and dollars, and probably about 150,0001. from Marseiles. Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in the stock and share markets during the past month. The range of Consols has again been only 1I per cent., but the fall experienced in April has been fully recovered, the Bank bullion having increased about three-quarters of a milion from the low point to which it was then reduced. In the sharemarket, where the fluctuations have also been moderate, there has not been the Eame firmness as in the funds, a decline having been established in many of the principal descriptions, including the Great Western, the North-Western, the Lancashire and Yorkshire, the South-Eastern, and the SouthWestern:- FLUCTUATIONS fLT THZ STOCK AIM SBAZx MARXS DURLiG THE MONTH OP MAY. 18.57. On the continental bourses there has been uninterrupted dullness. The French Three per Cents. have recovered only about # per cent. from the fall f Ij per cent. established at the end of April, and at Amsterdam and Vienna there has been no movemnent of the slightest importance. Subjoined are the railway calls for the month of June so far as they have yet been advertised:- ane private letters trom Paris state, with reference to the fact of the committee of the Legislative body haviDg in the first instance recommended the rejection of the Bank of France Bill, that but for the approach of the general election its members would not have given way, and that the Bill would have been thrown out by the Legislative body as well as by its committee. The railway meetings of the week have not been Lumerous. The report of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Company states that the works are progressing on 94 miles of the line. An endea-vour is to be made to obtain from the home Governmnent of India a sanction for executing the junction route between Bombay and SUrat. According to the report of the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Rail-~ way the directors recommend a dividend of 8s. per share free of income-tax, being at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. At the meeting of the Waterford and K.ilkenny Company the report was adopted, and economy in locomotive expenses was urged. The report has been adopted of the Monmouthshire Company, and a dividend declared at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. Some of the shareholders desire a direct communication with Merthyr Tydvil, which it is asserted would give a great accession of traffic. Atthe Bradford, Wakeiel, and Leeds meeting it was stated that the time for openirg the line depends upon the completion of the earthworks, which are now in a forward condition. It has been announced that the Tibury, Blaldon, and Colchester project has been abandoned, owing to an arrangement entered into with the EaAtern Counties Company. The shareholders of the Llanelly Railway have authorized the directors to issue the proposed substituted shares, to be entitled to 6 per cent. per annum to June, 1860, and b per cent. per annum subsequently. The prospects of the Limerick and Ennis are considered more favourable, and the works have made considerable 'rogress since they came into the hands of Mr. argan. At a meeting of the Trust and Loan Company of Canada held to-day a dividend at the rate of 7i per cent, was declared, and the report, of which an abstract appeared on the 25th inst., was adopted.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, MAy 30. Thero was an inactive market this morning, and prices wero weak ard unsatisfactory for all kinds of cloth and yarn. For domestics there was but little inquiry, and long cloths and T-cloths were neglected, with prices against the seller. For printing clothaprices are nominally steady,witha limited business, and a shiht concession has to be made to effect sales of any magnitae. Tho same remarks apply to 36 and 40-inch shirtings; and manufaoturers begin to ook forrelief only from the shtort time movement, which is now in operation at Manchester, Stockpoort, Bacup, and Bmrnley; while Prestou and Blaclsburn will probably follow the example. Spinners are compelled to pursue a system of restriction, all kinds of yarn being in limited req-uest, and especially those for home consumption. BrRur±aGHA.m May30. There is little new to report with regard to the general trades and manuf&ctures of the town and district. The chief firms in the iron trade are busy, and prices continue to be well maintained. At the usual weekly assemblage in this town on Thursday but a small amount of business was traneacted; but the tone of the market was firm, and the tendency upwards. The make of pigs cosntinues to be great, and best mine qualities are fetching 41. 5s. The foreign trade in general hardware is decidedly imn proving. From South America and the East Indies the orders are good, and for the Canadas more than usnally large. The factors of Birmingham report that the home trade is about the average at this period of the year; but the manufacturers employed in some branches of local production complain of dulness. This is however, attributed mainly to the uncertain price of metafs, more especially of copper and brass. The founders of articles of which these metals constitute the materials are consequently but indifferently employed; but the manufacture exhibits signs of reanimation. Stocks are understocd to be small, andrif prices were more firmly settled the demand throughout the ocuntry, it is thought, woould be unusually great. The electro plate and jewelry businesses are busy, and for edged tools and husbandry implements there is, as the season advances, an increased demand. It is reported that the London Works at Smethwick, for. merly carried on by Sir Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson, are likely to be purchased by a party or parties competent to conduct them with spirit and success, and that from present appearances the assets tnder the bankruptcy wil be larger than at one time anticipated. It will be recollected that,among other contracts Fox and Henderson had on hand at the time of their failure, was a short unfinished foreign railway (Danish, we believe), for the cost of which they could make no claim if not completed within the time specified. This undertaking promised to be a serious loss to the estate, but now there are expectations of its turning out a considerable gain. Great efforts are being made to complete the eontract, and with this object one or more gentlemen interested in the realization of Fox and Henderson's (state have consented to render pacuniary assitance, and the works, it is understood, will be prosecuted with the reatest possible vigour. It is estiimated that the completion ef this contract, according to the terms of the agreement, wfill add 153, Cl, to the assets available for the general body From the neighbouring manufacturing towns reports of the state of trade are upon the whole favourable. The chief establishments at Dudley, Westbromwich, Wednesbury, and Walsall are moderately weu occupied, and at Redditch the needle makers are full of orders. At Coventry the watch and riband trades are more active than they were at the commencement of the year, and few complaints are made either by masters or workpeople. LEICESTER MWAY 30. In most branches of the hosiery trade there is very little doing. There is, however, a demand for socks and fancv hosiery, and this partial demand gives an appearance of acti. vity, and relieves to some extent the otherwise dulluness of the general trade. Worsted spinners are slack. Hosiery manufacturers are creating as little stock as possible, the high price of the raw material checking anything like speculation. The framework-knitting operatives are only partially employed. The same deadness characterizes the hosiery trade at Loughborough and Hinokley, and the surrounding country districts. NORWICH« MAfY 30. The manufacturing trade here continues qtuot, although some firms have commenced the execution of their autumn orders, and a little has been doing in winter flounce goods and satin tops. The shoo business is still reported to he In an active condition, and fresh placards are posted inviting the services of more workmen. The high rates of leather are, however, much complained of, and the extent of the grievance will be seen by the following comparative statement of prices :- IS3. 1857. Best Eole leathier pelb 30prl. Upper leather .. 2 8perb. . 4 0 parlb. Dittofor workingmen'swea :: 1 6 :: ;3 8 But for this enormous advance in the prices of materials, and the difficalty experienced in obtaining a sufficient number of good workmen, there seems to be scarcely any limit at present to the development of the shoe business in this city, LEEDS, MAY 30. The coloured cloth-hall was well attended this morningconsiderable animation prevaUed, and a somewhat large amount of goods was cleared out. In the white cloth-hall, the demand for the materials sold there being small at this season of the year, a quieter tone prevailed; but to day's markets, upon the whole, were decidedly better than for some weeks past. The reason of this improvement is not very perceptible, as trade in the warehouses stil continues far from brisk. A moderate number of buyers have been down during the week, but they have only operated to a limited extent, and complain much of the present range of prices. The local wool brokers complain of dulness, particularly considering the time of year; and there is no doubt that the decided ft.nnes which has been manifested at the London wool sales, which close this day, will iaduce manufacturers to act with great caution in buying the raw material. BRADFORD, MAY 30. There is not much alteration to report in the trade of the worsted district. There are more buyers in town this week, and a somewhat better inquiry is experienced for piece goods, but the individual transaetions entered into are not to any extent, and chiefly for light descriptions at rather easier prices. Yarns find a quiet trade, and for lower counts slightly lower rates are accepted. The wool-market is without material change. Business to a moderate amount is doing in combing wools for immediate consumption, at about the prices current last week. 6lothing wools firmly mnaintain late currencies, with a fuU demand. HALIFAX, MAIY 30. The trade of this town does not present any now features of importance. Prices remain unaltered, and there is not miuch activity prevaiuing. DUBLIN, MAY 29. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, May 28, inclusive, were 19,2661., against 20,4171. last week. BELFAST, MAY 29. Linen.-We cannot notice any alteration in demand or price during the week, in ether brown or white linens. en yarn firm. The stock of the coarser descriptions is small, and the demand from manufacturers fair for the season. Flax-The principal supply of flax in the different coun. try towns at present is almost all in the hands of dealers, who pick up during the week any farmers' lots they can find, which is readily taken off their hands on market day by theattending buygrs Cotton.-In the Belfast market wa can note only a slight change of improvement. Sales of whitegoods have been more eassy effected, and for some qualities of gray muslins a better tone pervades business, but, as compared with the end of May, 1852, the state of trade is more than quiet in all its branches, save thatof the power loom. For the goods fiished on the latter system of manufacture there has been a good demand, andl st;ocks of all qualities are in a healthy state. The quantity of cloth made by the hand-loom weavers sice the commencement of the fine weather has. been very trifling; now, however, that the oats and barley lands have been all finished, and that mnost of the late potatoes have been planted, the greater numaber of hands have again returned to work, and a large amount of produce may be expected from the present, and up to the harve-st season.

RAILWAY INTELLMGENCE. LEEDS. BRADFORD. AND HATTFAX 3TTTh1'TaN The quarterly meeting for the decluration of a dividend was held at Bradford on Friday; Mr. W. Cheeseborough presided. Mr. M. Cawood, secretary, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in T Timzs. The CH.TMA, in moving the adoption of tho retort, stated that the main line was in a very efficient condition; when compared with the corresponding quarter of last year there had ben a considerable increase in the traffic, and the directors had reason to believe that it would be stiUl greater from sources as yet undeveloped. The arrangements for running a portion of the trains into the Lancashire and Yorkshire s;ation, Bradford, were pro A long discussion ensued respecting the proprlety o declaring a dividend of 6 per cent. It appeared that, without trenchingon the reserved fund, the profits would not warrant a dividend of more than 5 per cent. Eventnally it was moved by Mr. W. PzmL and resolved, that a dividend of 5 per cent. be declared. The proceedings terminated with a vote of thanls to the chairman. COLN VALLEY AND HAISTEAD. Theo onstruction of this line is about to be commencecd It will extend from the Chappel station, on the Colchester, Stour Valley, and Sudbury Railway, to Halstead, a distance of about fxve miles. Mfr. Beardmore is the engineer. LLANIDLOES AND NEWTOWN. The works on this line are rogr ssing satisfactorily; the rails have been purchased andthebridgesandearthworks are in so forward a condition as to insure the opening in October. It is statedthat the contractor has offered to lease the line at 5 per cent. on the capital expended so long as the line ends at Newtown, and by a rise each year of 1 percent. until it reaches 10 per cent., when opened to Oswestry. So long as the terminus remains at Penstrowed the interest is to be 4 percent. A special meeting of the shareholders is to be hedd to consider the offer. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RAIWAY Po'TrShOUTm. Sir J. TROLLOPB reported from the committee that the objects of the bill as originally introduced were the constructionof anew line of railway and branch to join the Cosham and Portsmouth line, withpower to use portions of the railway to Portsmouth belonging to the London, Brighton, and South Coast and London and South-Western Raiway Companies in connexion therewith; to make a riew road at Wormley-hill and to divert other roads; to extend the time for the purcfiae of land and oompletion of the oxtension railway from Godalming tolShalford; poweri to cancel unissaed or forfeited shares, and to create and is*ue new shares with a preference dividend in lien thereof -nd traffic arrangements with the London and South-Weste n London, Brighton, and South Coast, and South-Elnt.rn Railway Companies. The provisions in referenco to the new line of railway and branch to join the Coeham .ud Portsmouth line, and the extension of time for thepbr chase of lands for and completion of the railway from Godalming to Shalford, were withdrawn by the promoters, and the bill, as submitted tothe committee, was confine4 to the remaining objects. The commnittee had amended the preamble of the bill by striking out so much thereof as related to the construction of the new railway and branch, the power to use certain nortions of the line to Portsmouth, and the extension of timie for purchase of lands for and completion of the extension from Godalming to Shalfdrd, and found the same as amended to be true.

INDIA AND CHINA. By the arival of the Overland Mail we have re.i 'ceived our private correspondence and journals from aombay to the 1st of May; Calcutta, 22d of April; -and Hongkong, 15th of ApriL "CALCUTTA, APRPL 21. "The mutinous spirit in the army appears to have received a check. The fate of the l9th Native Infantry has friihtened men who, whatever else they mnay wish, do not wish to cease to be soldiers. The anen of the 36th who taunted the pupils in the Umballa school of exercise are under triaL The 34th, though still sullen, are completely cowed, and the wavering regiments-notably the 2d Grenadiers-seem, native-like, to have made up their miinds to side 'with the strongest. The fate of the *4th Native Infantry is not yet decided, but I hear that Government will probably discharge the dis.afected, without breaking up tbe regiment. There is a hope very generally expressed that the punish3ment wiiU be accompanied by some compliment to the Mussulmans, who have behaved conspicuously well. The vacillation of the Commander-in-Chief ,somewhat impairs the energy of the military authorities at Barrackpore. The jemadar commanding the guard which refused to assist Lieutenant lBaugh has been sentenced by a native court-martial to 'death. Such a sentence on a commissioned officer must be confirmed by the Comnander-in-Chief. It was confirmed by telegraph, but on the morning of the execution an order was 'transmitted, staying execution tiU General Anson had received the evidence in detail. The men who attempted to tamper with the Mint Guard have received 14 yeara' transportation. This leniency is to be regretted, as a plan did really 4xist for seizing tbe Mint and plundering the vaulte. It is the only inbtance in which the native -court-martials have failed in their duty. They have *been throughout the affair somewhat severe, a fact the more remam kable as they are chosen almost by lot, and are absolutely independent. " The affair will blow over, but it has brought up the question of a reorganization of the army. It is the opinion of the ableat officers in ,the service that the Sepoy army is hopelessly effete. The men are as good as ever they -were, but the organization has broken down. Disclpline has been relaxed by the tendency to deprive 'commanding officers of power. The connexion between officers and men has been broken by inces.'ant diaughts for civil employ, and the change in maorals, together with the new facilities for reaching Europe, have 'un-Hindooized' the officers. That this state of affairs can be remedied is evident from the condition of the Irregulars. They neither anutiny nor murmur, are always ready for service, oand always devoted to their leaders. Two distinct plans, therefore, have their advocates in the country. By one plan, supported by men like Sir Henry Lawrence, Colonel Edwardes, Colonel Jacob, and successful officers generally, the line will be reduced in strength. It will be somewhat over-officered, in ,order to act as a depOt, or, rather, reservoir, of irregular officers. The vacancy will be filled up by an addi-tion of 20,000 Europeans to the army, and the creation of say 60 new irregular corps. The opponents .of this plan, comprising most Queen's officers in the country, prefer to reinvigorate the ancient system Wby compelling all officers to remain with their regiments, by creating a civil staff corps, and by introducing the harsher discipline of continental -'asmies. *The news of peace in Persia has been received without pleasure in Bengal. The war was never very popular, but Anglo-Indians are educated in the 'belief that war should end in conquest, in the utter -destruction of the opposing power. The treaty is condemned, therefore, as producing no permanent result. The surrender of Herat to its native chiefs sounds like a joke. Herat has no native chiefs who -could defend it for a month, and it may be retaken just when the Shah chooses to repeat his -expeiiment. The news of war with Ohina, how*ever, has been received with universal congratulations. Nobody in this country ever doubted that .Sir John Bowring was in the right, but many feared that the nation, misled by dreams of peace, would decline to support bis acts. Accordingly, the merchants of Calcutta are about to attend Lord Canning with an addreEs expressing their unanimous s)ympathy with the poliey of Lord Palmerston, and the r conviction that the time for concession to the "Chinese has passed. The news of eventa in Sarawak has increased the prevailing enthusiasm. Those events are beyond my province, but Sir James Brooke is one of the heroes of the Anglo-Indian -c( mmunity. When the commission of inquiry was -ordered it was difficult to find two commissioners from the extraordinary prepossession in his favour, ,nnd I have known quiet officials who actuallyresented zabuse of the Rajahl as vehemently as a personal insult to themselves. You will observe that at fSingapore the very men who, in 1854, called for the -commission of inquiry, have passed at a public *meeting an address, congratulating the Rajah on ?his 'just severity.' " Fruzl Alee, the dacoit chief who murdered :Mr. Boileau, the depu y-commissioner of Secrora, Oude, has been put to death. He wvas pursued by <Captain Boileau at the head of a party of frregulars. Another party, commanded by Lieutenant L. ,Clarke, was detached a little to the westward of the miain body. Fruzl Ales tried his old game, diving at once into the jungles of the Nepaul Valley. The -officers pursued, and Lieutenant Clarke came on the bandit -while reposing in the full confidence of security. A short but desperate engagement ensued, the Irregulars and the dacoits fighting hand to hand. It terminated in the slaughter of the entire band. Fruzl Alee, his 'brother, his nephew, and the principal followers were left dead on the field. The example will be of the highest benefit in Oude. Fruzl Alee, as I -mentioned in my last, had thrown away his last chance ,by the murder of a European. That is the one 'crime our Government never by any chance fails to punish, and in this instance their officers have somewhat shocked European notions of intermational law. Jung Bahadoor, however, is a man of -seene, with little love for Dacoits, and will probably take no notice of the violation of his ter.- tony. (>holab Singh, the Maharajah of Cashmere, is believed to be on his deathbed. His nephew Jowahir Singh has left Lahore to look after his own interests. flis successor is his son Runheer Singh, but it is /not certain if he will succeed. The fiendish* I,cruelty of his father has embittered the people to a -degree unprecedented in India. The old tyrant was *supported by his soldiery, but the mercenaries will probably at his death split into two parties, one fighting for the son and the other for the nephew. The British Government must then interfere effectuallv. The accounts which reach me of the atrocities committed in the 'Happy VaUey' are ineredible. The people are taxed till the whole territory is faUing out of cultivation. The passes are -guarded, and every man who attempts to fly is snutilated, his wife killed, and his property contrcated. Sometimes a few manage to escape in 'the train of a European. One oflicer who saved 2a few families says that at one moment the 'whole party were in danger of death. He en- I treated the Cashmerians to go back. They refused peremptorily, aying ' What is death compared to I the Maharajah ' Molten lead is, in Cashmere, an ! -orainary intrument of taxation. The people have smuggled out petition after petition to Sir John lawrence, but the iniquitous act of Lord HIardinge, "who sold Cashmere to a man he knewf to be a fiend, has hitherto prevented interference. We cannot move till one party or other entreats our protection, and then we shall probably move to purpose. At present -evenadecree throwing open the passes would depopulate Cashmere in a month. Thepeople arenotoriously industrious, but their beautiful manufactures are -dying out. The shawlmakers refuse to work for GIholab Singli's benefit, and take to cultivation to avoid making a profit snatched from them by the tyrant. "There is little domestic news stirring. Two wars ;and half-a-dozen mutinies give the Governor-General enough to do, and till the Governor-General moves internal reform is impossible. There is a general feeling, however, that Lord Canning, who 'was greatly distrusted by the community, has behaved well in a very difficult crisis. He is under-atood to have followed his own course, to have repremsed wild counsels, and to have Laid down a course -of action to which he has firmly adhered. During the height of the di±oontent v while every night pio-duced a new plot, he still entrusted Government Rouse to the custody of the mutinous regiment. bqhe sent'y at his own library door was one of the -pr y suspected of the most violent designs, and any A of daDger to himseli only produced a smile. Firmness of this kind is perhaps over.appreciated in India." The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent : "BOMBAY, MAY 1. "None of the troops that had actually reached Bushire have yet returned to Bombay. Some of the latest departures have been overtaken and recalled, as I mentioned in my last. Among them is one squadron of the 14th Light Dragoons, 'which has gone back to its old quarters at Kirkee, -without even having landed on the enemy's ground. The number of vesEels in the service of Government is however larger than ever, and commissariat stores are still forwarded in large quantities. No fewer than 96 sailing craft of various kinds, besides several steamers-the ships averaging fully 1,000 tons-are at present carrying the pennant at a total monthly cost of about 100,0001. The great majority of these will no doubt remain in the Gulf till after the monsoon. One of the larger steam frigates, probably the Assaye, will proceed from Bushire to Suez, erhaps touching here first to take on board Lord ]gin and convey bim to China. Major-General Ashburnham is expected to arrive here on his way to China by the next mail. " We have nothing of importance from Affghanistan, save the announcement that Major Lumsd en and the British mission was at the fort of Koorun (in the valley of that name, which was lately entered by a force from Peahawur), on the 20th of March. The commandant of the fort turned out his garrison to receive the party, and showed them all the civilities in his power. A troublesome clan being in arms to impede their fiurther progress he detained them in his fort while with a strong body of men he advanced to clear the way for them. "From Madras we hear of General Grant's investiture at the hands of Lord Harris with the insignia of the Bath. Here it is getting very hot and very empty. Sir H. Somerset and the head-quarter staff of the army went -up to Mahableshwur last week. " A meeting of the Bombay shareholders of the London and Eastern Bank was held yesterday. It appeared from the accounts submitted to the meeting that the assets of the branch were amply sufficient to meet all engagements. An explanatsry statement was given of the arraDgements entered into by the London Directors with the Oriental Bank, and of the advantages to be derived from the assistance tendered by that corporation. Those arrangements were unanimously approved, and all the shareholders present agreed to sign promissory notes, payable to the Oriental Bank Corporation, for the 501. per share not yet called up in respect of the shares held by them in the London and Eastern Banking Corporation.

HONGKONG, APm 15. Our latest advices from England are to the 26th of February, received by the steamer Cadiz on the 11th inst. The steamer did not bring a regular mail.

The Chinese warjunks and boats, which were at one time so numerous in the vicinity of our vessels, are said to have nearly all disappeared. IRear-Admiral Sir Michael Seymour has his flag at present on board Her Majesty's ship Calcutta in the harbour. On the 2d inst. the boats of the Hon. Company's steamer Auckland, at Tung Chung bay, cut out a mandarin junk, which was brought in here by the steamer. A battery on shore, which opened fire on the boats as they were-pulling in, was also taken possession of, and held till the junk waa got under way. In this service I regret -to say that two officers and one seaman were severely wounded, and four men wounded slightly. I have also to notice an engagement which took place when the boats of Her Majesty steamers Sampson and Hornet and ship Sibylle, under Commodore Elliot, attacked a strong force of Mandarin boats and three lorchas in Deep Bay, at the entrance of the Canton river. Ten boats and the three lorchas were destroyed. The firing that was kept up on our boats from the shore, wbere a great number of Chinese soldiers were congregated, was very heavy, but the only accident on our side was one man severely wounded. Some important papers are said to have been found on board the junks, but their contents are not at present made public. The Company's steamerAuckland left here for Singapore on the 6th inst. During her short sojourn bere she succeeded on several occasions in rendering good service. The Company's steamer Zenobia left this on the 7th inst. for Singapore and Madras. Her Majesty steamer Barracouta left for England on the 13th inst. Elis Excellency Sir John Bowring, after the receipt of his despatches by last mail, 10th of February, visited Macao, where he had a conference with the French and American Ministers. It is understood that instructions have been sent out by the Imperial French Government that theFrench forces in these parts are to co-operate with ours in the present crisis in China. The American Minister had not received similar orders from his Government. The Frenoh minister M. Bourbillon, is at present here on a visit to Sir ohn Bowring. We have to report a most atrocious murder wbich has been perpetrated here. Mr. Charles Markwick, Government auctioneer, formerly a servant in the East India Company's service in Canton, and one of the oldest European residents in China, was strangled while confined to his bed by sickness, by one of his house servants, for the sake, it would appear, of some little property which was in the house. The miscreant has for the present escaped, but, as the Government have offered a reward of $ for his apprehension, it is likely this may ultimately lead to his being secured. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Lady Mary Wood anrived yesterday from Shanghai with dates to the 6th inst. The steamer touched at the other ports on her way down, and reports that quiet prevailed. Above Chimmoo the steamer fell in with two large rice junks, which were being attacked by eight large piratical boats and a heavily armed lorcha. On the steamer approaching the pirates made off. Thejunks were taken in tow by the steamer and brought to Amoy. The crews reported they had been fighting for three days and nights. A great number on board the junks were killed or wounded. Pekin G$aettes reach to the 2d of March, but still no mention is made of the Canton question. The Shanghai officials, with, it would appear the eoncurrence of the Imperial Government, hve imposed a duty of 12 taels per chest on the entrance of opium into Shanghai. The money goes into the Imperial Treasury for payment of troops. At Ningpo a collision had taken place between the French and Portuguese lorchamen. Two of the former were wounded. The matter has been reported to the French Minister, and an inquiry will, no doulbt, be instituted. From Canton we have no reliable information. Great distress, we hear, prevails in the neighbourhood from the high price of rice. At Hongkong there is very little doing in the way of business. Cotton, small sales at, for Bengal, $9j to $91; and Bombay, $10 to $10J per picul. Cotton yarn.-High numbers are 'wanted. Nos. 16 to 24, S26; No. 28 to 32, $34 to ,35; No. 38 to 42, $42 to $44.

Of green teas 33,000 packages were settled. The advance on black teas was about two taels on Ningehow congou, and one tael on common kinds. The quotation for green tea remained about the same as last month.

COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. (Irom tie Bombay Timem,.) REPORT OX THE STATE OF BO0MBAY MARKT FROM THE 16TH TO THE 3QrH oP APRi 1857. The Overland Mail from London of the 26th of March, per the Peninsular and Oriental Company' steamship GaBsB, reached Bombay otl the niight of the 20th of Our money-market during the past fortnight has continned in the same ew state as reported in our last. The rates of discount ruling at the banks continue the same, and are likely to remain go til the season is over. We hear that the liabilities of the branch here of the London and Eastern Bank are not of a serious nature, and it is supposed there will he suflicient funds to meet its engagements. Government securities and local joint-stock shares continue at about former quotations. IMPOR¶S. Cotton Piece Goodx.-The amont of business transacted during the fortnight has been to a limited extent. Shirt. ings of all descriptions are in good demand, aS well as mada. pollams, vvhich are in good demand and scarce. T-cloth is itnh very gkood demand, and there is no stock of it available in Bleached and Fancy Goods.-Bleached satin spota continue very scarce and in good demand.

Saiffon is dull, and has declined in value. EXPOFar. Cotton Wool.-Tho market continues dull, and prices have declined, owing to the arrivals being freer. Oil Seeds.-These continue in the same declined state as lest reported. Opiunm.-An advance in the price of this drug is to be noticed, and we now quote 1,080r.tol,090r. forIndore and Mundlesir. The Peninsular and Oriental Companys steamer Aden takes for the Chinese ports about 1,200 chests this evening. Tonnage.-Freights are very dull, and the arrivals are numerous; and no advance in the rates is expected soon. Our present quotation is from 24. 1s. to 21. 17s. 6d. for Liverpool. Exchange:.-A large business was done in local bils credits, and documents, at 2s. 1id., previous to the arrival of the China steamer, and afterwards, at same rate, for China drawn back, and 2s. lid. for local credits. but this last day or two holders have beenfirmer, and the rateisnow 2s.

Wednesday, April 22. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Hindostan, with the London mail of the 10th ult., arrived here only on the 20th inst, the advices by her having already been antlcipated both by electric telegraph and the Bombay D&k. Yesterday morning we received vid Bombay intelligence from London to the 26th ult. We have had no change in our produce-market, although operations may be said to have been on a smaller scale, in consequence of the continuauce of high prices for our staple articles and high freights. Very little doing in indigo. We have had a smaller business m sugar for Great Britain owing to the rise in freights, nor have the Bombay shippers been very eager to make purchases. Of rice we do not notice any change in table qualities, but Ballam has been in active request. Saltpetre has been in less demand, and value lower. An active demand prevailed for raw silk at extreme figures, but the market closes flatly. There have been large sales of Hurrypaul, but the middg and low qualities of all denominations are neglected, and comnparatively lower offers made for them. We have had some in. quiry for corahs of good makes. Linseed continues to move off for the United States at unaltered prieos. Rape, tee, and.poppy have been in lesz demand. No change in the I osition of other articles. The receipt of favourable advices from the Upper Pro. vinces as regards piece goods and twist has caused a better feeling in our import market, and native dealers have shown more vrillingness to operate. The sales during the past fortnight, notwithstanding the intervention of holydays, have been to a fair extent and in some instances at enhanced figures. Mule twist especially and coloured yarn have advanced in value, but we have no change in Monoy Market.-We have agair to report favourably on this head, the market having become easier since our last, though not to any great extent. A further reduction of 1 per cent. in the rates of the Bank of Bengal took place on *hursday last. The last statement of the bank's liabilities and as£ets for the week ending on the 15th inst. will be found below. The amount of cash as compared with the statement instted in our preceding number has increased from Rs. 87,62,00a-8-3 to Co.'s Rs. 1,11,34,597-12-0, while that of loans on deposit of securities has decreased from Bs. 1,38,88,939-113 to Rs. 1,28,90,245-6-4.

The value of other joint-stock shares is well supported, but no transactions 3eported. The Ganges Sem mNavigation Company have declared, a dividend at the rate of 24 per cent. per annum. Government Securit[es.-The improved aspect of our money-market is gradually affording more confidence to capitalists and native aeaers, although we have scarcely expesieneed any alteration in our quotations, Compy'sEour x.er Centb, only being a shade better. Our closing rates are lol this; desciptiongf pajier15r,4ae tl6r ifog8ghaFo -17r. to 17r.4a., and for4Company's F1ves 2-& to 4a. percent. dicount. Other securitiesaare nominal at our quotations. Exchange.-On London-The rate for the present mall opened at 2a. 1id. for irst clwz six months' sight bills, adid at this figure considerable business Was transacted, when the rate fell to 2s. -Id., which may be considered the closing quotation, with perhaps a slight downward tendency. On China, some transactions in 60 days' sight bills took place at 216r., bat the rate has advanced to 219r, at which we hear business was done last. }reights.-A further improvement has taken place since our last, and, although the arrivals during the past fortnight have been more numerous in proportion to the preceding period, yet some of them being American vessels and otbers whose destinations Ead beenp reviously fixed, the available tonnage has not been sufficient to meet our requirements, Favourable advices, moreover, for rice from China caused an increased demand on the part of shippers, and con. sequently higher rates have been paid. We hear as yet only five ships of about -4,000 tons capacity have been taken up by Government for the conveyance of coals and hay to the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding that 1 0,000 tons ramain still to be engaged or not hereafter,according to the turncircumnstances might take. The rates to China have advanced from $1 perbag to S1 25c., and to Mauritius from Ir. 8s. to 2r. per bag, and to other ports on the east and west of tne Bayof Bengal we observesproportionateriss. Oar quotations for London are 41. 12s. 6d. to 41. 15a., and for iverpool 41. 5s. to 41. 7s. 6d. per ton, at the close the market showing an upward tendency. Viewing the presEnt aspect of ankirs, and the prospect of produce being abundant on the opening of the rivers, combined with the expectations of a moderate amount of inward tonnage durin the next three months, we might reasonably look forward to a further advance in our ratee to all ports. The following charters have been effected since our last*The Forfarshare to convey coals and hay to Bnahire at , Or. per ton; the Pearl, for the same voyage, at 52r. ; the Sagoff at 54r.; the Hamlet at 55r, and the Canada'at 57r.

EGYPT. (FUoM OuB OWN CORRESPOND7WTA ALEXANDRIA, MAY 22. The India and China mails arrived at Suez by the Peninsular and Oriental CompAny's steamers Ganges and Bengal, from Bomboay and Calcutta respectively, on the 17th and 20th inst., and the outward mails, which reached Alexandria on Tuesday, will probably leave Suez this day. The fast month of Ramadan is now approaching its end, and the Viceroy, who has passed the greater portion of it at his favourite place of residence ast Mariout, has for some days been at Alexandria. He was to embark this morning by the FeizJehad steam frigate for a short cruise, but his absence will necessarily be a short one, the customary official receptions during the Bauram holydays being already announced. His Highness, it is expected, will afterwards proceed to Cairo, and it is reported that he contemplates shortly visiting the Oasis of Siwah. It might appear improbable that he should undertake a long and laborious journey at this season of the year, but Said Pasha seems bent upon inspecting all parts of his dominions himself, and his character for indifference to Personal hardship and fatigue is now so wel established that it will excite very little surprise if the report be confirmed. For the last few days his Highness has resided at a countryhouse, which he has just purchased in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, and which has cost him 35,0001. To those who only know Egypt as it was the price wil no doubt appear very large, but the advance in the value of property has of late years been so great and unceasing that it almost seems as if destined to form a permanent subject for wondering conmment, even among the most far-seeing of the inhabitants. It may, indeed be doubted whether any other " old" country could cite so extraordinary an increase in the value of property as that which has been witnessed here during the last 12 or 15 years. As an instance, I may mention the case of a small property in the vicinity of Alexandria, which a few years ago was valued at from 1,5001. to 2,0001., and which has just realized 32,0001.-a price equal to little less than 1,0001. an acre. As iRustrating the increase in the value of property within the town, I may add that house rent has in many cases been trebled within the last five years. The Viceroy's son Toussoun Pasha, a fine little boy of about six years of age, goes to Marseilles by the next French steamer for temporary change of climate. He will be accompanied by Achmed Menikli Pasha, the General who commanded the Egyptian Contingent in the late Russian war; by a physician, and by his English nurse. The little Prince will make some stay at Marseilles, where he will be tne guest of M. Pastre, one of the leading merchants of Alexandria, and it is said that his Journey will probably be extended to England. Her Majesty's ship Tartarus has sailed for Rhodes, for the purpose of taking a series of deep-water soundings on the line between Alexandria and that island. Transactions in our grain-market are almost entirely limited to the sale of contracts for future delivery. Of these, for the delivery of Saide wheat in September and October 182,000 quarters are estimated to have changed hands, and the price is at the present moment equivalent to about 37s. 6d. per quarter free on board. Some trifling quantities of beans and barley have commenced ariiving, but they are bought up chiefly for home consunmption. The cotton-market was rather quiet during the earlier part of the fortnight, but the receipt of the last intelligence from Liverpool has given it a fresh imnpulse, and prices are again firm. Exchange on LJondon at three months' date, 1fl2' piasters per pound; M.arseilles, 4f. 9Gc. to 4f. 97c; per dollar. ____
THB Bow ny ftuST MluRDn.-Since the committal of George Jackson and Charles Brown, charged with the murder of Mr. W. Charleswortb, as reported in The Tinmes of Friday, both the prisoners have made confessions. That of George Jackson is as follows:-"I went to the Coach and Horses on Friday night, and was looling at them bowling, and they made me make one. This young man was then in the house. I sat in the house on the contray side to Mr. Bamford. Mr. Bamford and Mr. Charlesworth were quarrelling, and I listened to them. John Cresswell (called 'Dulcimer Jack') and Brown were making a bargain to go and frighten Charlesworth. Cresswell asid, ' r go and put another jacket on, so he won't know me ;' and when against Mr. Fitchett's hedge he said, 'You must not say anything, we sbhll have something to-night.' He said to me and Charles Brown, ' Go on after him, and follow him, and lay hold of him, and 'll follow.' I felt very tipsy, and me and Brown went on, and I was going on and Brown said, 'Oh, oome on, we shall have somo money to-night.' I was that tipsy I did not know wbat I wos doing. I puled a stake out of the bedge as I was goingalong, and Mr. Charlesworth askod me where I was going, and I told him I was going along the road, and he catched me a atroke with his stick. He nid, 'I know you are after me; you mean to rob me.' Then he up with his sick to hit me again, and I t this stick and I hit him on the back of the head and knocked him down, and I was so sorry I tumbled down my. self. I was very tipsy, andl did not know what I was doing or I should not have done it. That was all as Idid at him, and Charles Brown picked his pockets and gave me the money, and I put it into my pocket; and he Picked up the stake. but whether he hit him I cannot tell, for I was that put about I sat on the hedge, and was rather sick directly after. He (Brown) said, 'Come on,' and we did, and we went off along the road across the fields. When We Rot towards our house he asked me for some money. I gavohim three halfcrowns. He said, ' The other will do at night,' and we parted at that, and I never saw no more of him till next day at the Coach and Horses 'Dnley Jack' came to me and eaid, ' You must not say anything;' so that's how it was settled." Brown said, "I did not pick up the stick, nor did not persuade him to go with me. I picked one pocket, he picked the other. I gave him the zaoney. He gave me two halfcrowns. That's all." y IAdvertizement.I-The Picture Galeriee of the Season.- Tle Royal riCnrUa eUPaTed in tle " ArTO.oe-Rea fer June (prije1 i 6d) are-" Plowieg BubbI "fteir Mierls.ad "The Aniva1 'f | Prinee Albert aS Days,," f*rew iL.

IRBELND. (Prox OUR OWN OORR1O2Nwmn.1 DUBLIN, SATUIiDAY MORINMG. THE 1EW CHIEF SECRETARY. The address of Mr. Henry Arthur Herbert, soliciting a renewal of the confidence of his constituents, appears in the Kerry papers of yesterday. Having, after some consideration, undertakenthe responsible duties of Chief Secretary for Ireland, the hon. gentleman proceeds to say:- - "A few weeks ago I had the hononr of addresig youx without nserve on most of the subjects of public interest in Ireland, and I have reason to believe that the sentiments I then expressed met with the approval of the majority of my constituents. I trust youwil, therefore, consider it unnecessary for me to reiterate the expression of opinion of wbich you are already aware - but I may be permitted to say that as a member of thedovernmment, I adhere to those views wLichb as a private and independent member of Parliament, I professed. In the step Ibave taken I have made no sacrifice of principle. I have hitherto considered it my duty to give an independent support to Her Majesty's present Addministration, as one whose general policy I believe to be in accordace withthe wantsA and wisbesof the nation; and now inaccepting an appointment which waes alike tnexpected wad ansaolited cl my pant, it is in the earuest hope that I may thereby be enabled to help forward measures of practical utilit, and toapromote the interets and wAelfare of our common country". Louth M. Fortsn,ue observescu. Another Irish gentleman, Mr. Chichester Fortescue, who has accepted an office under the GovernmTent Dot necesitating a rte election for his seat mn Par]iament, has, nevertheless, deemed it respectful to his constituents to inform them publicly of the fact. In an address to the electors of Louth MIr. Fortescue observes: '"When I ventured to maintain lately upon the huatings the right of Irishmen to serve the Crown upon a footing of perfect equality with Englishmen or with Scotchmen, I did not anticipate the event of my ceasing to be a private mem. ber of Parliament. I feel confident, however, that you., gentlemen, will agree with me in holding it an honour for any man to take a share in the government of his country, an d in the belief that a position of labour and trust, such as that to which I have been appointed, is creditable to a member of Parliament and to the constituency which he represents. With this persuasion I should have presented myself to you with great confidence for the honour of re-election had the law required it upon the present occasion. Such, however, not being the case, I desire to com. municate in this way with my friends and constituents, to whom I am so deeply indebted, and to express my earnest hope and desire that, whether as an independent member of Parliament, or as a member of a GoverameutW I maybe able to do credit to their choioe.e" Commenting upon this address a Roman Catholic local journal remarks:- " The Under-Secrotaryship of the Colonies is not to be confounded with a junior Lordship of the 'freasury, which s all but a sinecure. The Colonia-ofico takes in a corApre hensive and varied scope, embracing numerous and at times confficting interests, and is, to all mtents and purposes, an admirable school for practically studying diplomacy and statesmanship. Mr. Fortescue is averyyonng man, and his appointment to suchanofficeisin itelf evidenceof thehigh opmion entertained of his qualifications by experienced statesmen, and herads, as we anticipate, his future introduction to the Cabinet. If Mr. Fortescue declined accepting office under the present Liberal Government, -we shoulid be the first to pronounce him unworthy to represent a county which has discredited that sordid, professional, and anti- English agitation whereby an effort-an impotent, thou - desperate one, no doubt-wasmade to supplanthim. Would that there were in office 20Dlrishmen of hisaterling indenend ence, fixed purpose, and superior judgment, and our chance of having acknowledged gnrevances redressed would be augmented Swentyfold, Oar country in not very rich in Parliamentalry reputations, nor have its representatives, taken collectively, been of late held in much regard. Such appointments, then, as that of Mlr. Fortscus, would imply that we are coming to the redeeming point, and that Ireland's representative character improves." THE PRIS AND TEE MAYO PETTOI. The clergy of Dr. MHale's diocess mustered in great force on Thursday last for the purpose of defending themselves from the charges preferred against them in the celebrated petition of Colonel Higgins, the defeated Roman Catholic candidate for the county of Alayo. If big words be of any worth) the reverend body are the moat maligned men in the Queen's dominions, and are, in fact, perfect samples of the Christian pastor; while their accuser, on the contrary, is the incarnation of all that is bad-of every sin that flesh is heir to. One resolution of the indignant gentleman declares that- "Colonel Biggins, by his cowardly and unscrupulous policy of preferring wholeale charges against the Roman Catholic clergy before a distaut tribunal, where they have no opportunity of rebutting them, hasthrown off the cloak of hypocrisy and exhibited himself to the eivilized world in the wicked deformity of his real character; and by his wiy attempt to excite religious animosity against the Roman Catholic clergymen, for his own personal aggrandizement, has thoroughly Identified himslf- with the inveterate and habitual maligners of his creed and country." PRICE OF PROVISIONS. The Dublin Mercantile Advertiser says,- "There are many circumstancos caloulated to give animpulse to trade, to relax the extreme severity, so to speak, of prices, and to ease the unusual pressure upon the resources of consamers, yet busiess continues exceedingly slack, and prices remain at such a high range as to prove a powerful mcentive to the most rigid economy. The weather is ex. ceedingly fine. It could not be more seasonable-more cheering to the hopes of the farmer-if it were bespoken to suit his views. Corn and provisions are teeming into the great English ports, particulsrly Liverpool, in immense quantities. Within the last few days upwards of 70,000 boxes of bamon, or about 1,200,0001. wortb, have been consigned to Liverpool houses from the United States- and though the general opinion amongthose who are qualifed to judge of the matter is that there are many reasons and much room for a considerable 'fall,' the article isasprecious a commodity in the pantries of housekeepers as if we were wholly depending upon our own rather limited supply of it. Neither does the glorious veather with which wre are soseasonably blessed, nor the fair promise of the crops, nor the foreign arrivals, which are considerable, seem to affect therates of grain, nor to check, in any degree, -the upward tendency of the markets. We believe, hovwever, that the failure of an extenive houso in Liverpool is owing tospeon. lation for an advance in the prioes of corn and provisons. which the result has disappointed. We had seen, some weeks since, New York eiroulars affecting to give accurate statistics of the amounts of stocks, and showing an immense falling off as compared with the preceding semson; but we now find that those figures were entirely false, and calculated, if not intended, to mislead the public."

CAPTURP OF A FoRaGi.-An extraordinary sensation has been created in Bedford and the whole district by the discovery that a man just apprehended for horse-stealing turns out to be the notorious John Thing Harradine, the great bill forger In Hnntingdonshire. For some months p3st a heavy reward has been offered for his apprehension upon charges of forgery, but to no effect, and it was gelserally believed he hadleft the country. Strange to say, after an extraordinary career he took a trip into Bedfordshire where he formerly lived, perhaps trusting to his loDg beird aud altered personal appearance to escape recognition; but stranger still, when he arrived there it came across his mind that he should be taken somernwero, some day, andthat be would rather be tried in Bedfordshire, " among his friends." It appears that he went to Bromham and took a cob out of the stable of Mr. Rogers, of whom he formerly occupied a farm at Badwell, and rode it to London. On the morning of the 22d inst. he was soen by a policeman riding through Whetstone, and a few days afterwards this officer saw a notice of a horse having been stolen, and the description convinced him that thio was the Bromham cob. He succeeded in tracing it to Redan-oo'taes, Upper Holloway, and then took it into Bedfordshire, wvhero lir. Rogers immediately identified it. Another polioeman of the S division was on the lookout immediately, and the same night, between 11 and 12, near the Redan-cottages, he saw a man crouching down; he went to the spot and the man started off. The oficer pursued, and tbe man fel down and was captured. When he was taken to Bedford the superintendent of police there recognized him, but did not recolItot his name. He told the prisoner as much, and he replied, "If you give me *piece of paper I wiU write my name, and all about it." He then wrote to the following effect :-" I give myself up into the hands of this Court. 1 had no idea of stealing the horse. My basiness down here was either to see MIr. Lavender or Mr. Higgins, to give myself up to tbem. I altored my mind, and took the horse with no intention of stealing him. My real namne is John T. Harradine," He subsequently stated that be took the horse in order that he might bo tried in Bedfordshire, and not be tried in Huntingdonshire; that he was tired of leading the life he had been leading. and he was a% are that thero was 1001. reward offered for his apprehension. He was taken before the magistrates at Bedford on Fiiday, and the charge of stealing the horse was preferrea against him. He admitted taking it, and then made a long statement about bis going into Bedfordshire, and then determininR to take the horse to serve two parposes-frst, t3 get back to London, as he had no money left, and he wished to obtain some information, and secondly, to tecure being tried in Bedfordshir He added,, "I intendea to give muyself usp at soane time% as moy wife and fanii Ieeed to) be more against ms than any other pee le, and I wals very uneoniforteble," The prisoner, who belongs toarespee. ble family, formnerly oconpied a farin at hRdwell near Bedford, hut it appears a curious inftuation for him to .prefer being tried there, as his forged hills include manyD purphourtigto be dtrawhn byt rbespectbeperfsosns inI itha ucasEe; tJ2e magistrates cojunmited the prisoner for trial
2THX ,BXIBITZION OQ. ART TREASUBS9& The attendance on Friday was not large, but 'n Satnrday the admisions reached 9,702. Of these 6,803 entered on payment. of the sbilling, and 2,899 were holders of season tickets. The visitors by the London and North-Western and oheffield Railways were 2,383, of whom about 1,000 were the workmen (and their families) in the employ of lessrs. Turton and Sons, from Sheffield, who arrivedabout 12 o'clock. In addition to these there were about 400 of the workmen of Mr. Grafton, calico printer, at Acerington. The latter arrived by the :ast Lancmhire Railway and walked n procession from Manchester with a band of music. Some of the Sheffield people showed less appreciation of the pictures and statuary than any of the working classe that have yet seen them, and left the building early to see the botanical gardens, and to visit Mianchester. lNo doubt to working people the want of labels to the paintings is a drawback, as few of them will expend an extra shilling on catalogues after payment of a xhilling for entering the building. There are now three catalogues required by a visitor wishing to see the entire building; one to the engravings at Gd.; one to the Soulages Collection at 2s. 6d., and the general catalogues to the paintings and sculpture, alreidy referred to, at is. It should be mentioned, however, that a portiont of the Sheffield visitors remained for many hours, and examined the paintings and other works of art with great care and apparent interest. We regret to atate that Mr.. Edward Holmes, who was employed by the Art Treasures Committee to select and hang the water-colour drawings and engravings in the Exhibition, died oix Monday last, at Bowdon, having over-exerted himself to complete his task at a time when he was suffering from jaundice. He leaves a widow who did all in her power to lighten his labours at the Ex:hiuition. Mr. Holmes was involved in expensive litigation some years previous to his death, by which he incurred heavy pecuniary liabilities. The generous devotion of his 'wife induced her to sacrifice the whole of a handsome fortune to relieve hiax from these liabilities; and that she has been left totally unprovided for through his death is a mattcr for deep sympathy and regret.
1THZ CRYSTAL PALACE. The first exhibition of flowers and fruit of the present season was held at the Cryst4 P,lace on Satmrday under circumsances which gave it a high dogree of interest. The exquisite charm peculiar to an exhibition of this description, especially when surroned, as in the palace at Sydenham, by so many accessories calculated to enhanoe its Own intnnsic beauty, and the numerous and briliant com1pany it invariably attracts, make it a thing to be remembered by all who participate in the gratification it imparts, and tho f1&e of Saturday was in nap repect an exception to any that have preceded it, unless it were made such by the superior exoellence of its general character, the artistic styIe in-which it was arranged, and the aids to which recourse was had to lend it additional attaction. Besides the exhibition itself, wthich It wire scarcely too much to say in its beauty and variety challenged the admiration of all eyes, and the objects of varied interest permanently connectedt with the building itself, the visitors had also an oppor. tunity of witnessing towards the close of the day-for the first time this summer-the whole system of waterwork; in full operation. The weather, too, could scarcely have been mere auspicious, and the result was that nearly 13,00) people were attracted by the occasion, including her Royal Highness the Duchels of Cambridge, and a considerable pro. portion of the 61ite of the metropolis and the surround. ig neighbourhood, among whom the number of ladieagreatly preponderatod. Of the whole number present 9,228 were season ticket holders, and 3,705 were admaitted on payment of half a guinea. By far the greater part of tke company was, of course, conveyed to the palacr by rail, but a very considerable number-betheeL 3,000 and 4,000 atleast-must have travelled by road, for during the day upwards of 1,700 carriages set down vistors at the western entrance to the building. The arrangement of tho exhibition was extremely simple, but admirably calculated to enable so large a number of people to witness it with comparative ease and comfort. A longitudinal row of benches, partitioned down the middle, on which most of the plants, flowers, and fruits wera displayed witha careful regard to effect, stretched along the greater part of the nave, interrupted only by the tranEept; and along the eastern division of the transept ran two slmilar ridges parallel with esch other, on one of which were arranged a miixed collection of stove and greenhouse plauts in flower, and on the other some of tho finestn=aleas ever exhibitedonany similar occssion. Immediately in the centre of the transept stood, in an enclosure specially dovoted to it, a magnifioont specimen of the pimelea spectablia,about 24 feet in circumferenoe, and completely mantled over with a rich nss of snowy white flower, which Was especially admirod. It is the property of Mr. Colyer, of Dufford, and las brought from the Swan liver. A white awning of light material susponded over the benches on which the flowers were arranged proteotodthe plants and the crowd of visitors from the glare of the sunlight; while the permanent rows of orange trees, pomegranates, anil ferns, with their cool green foliage, which slirt the nave and transept on either side,. and creeping plants that weave themselves among the pillars and girders, formed an appropriate setting to the pictare. At one end of the bench oocpying the southem portion of -the nave was a rare collection of roses of most exquisite beauty and fragrance, exhibited by Messrs. Paul, of Chesbunt; Mr. E. P. Francis, of Eertford; and Mr. A Rtowland, and the opposite end, abutting upon the transept, was devoted to the display of frait, consisting for the most part of pineapples, grapes (white and black), peaches, nectarines, melons, cherries, and figs, all which were declared by tho judges to be above tbe, average quality, notwithstanding the rigour of an ungeniaL spring. The intervals of the same bench on each side were occupied chiefly with choice specimens of calceolarias,. fuchsias, and pelargoniums, each in distinct varieties, the last of which were in great profusion, and filled a space of upwards of 200 feet in length. The bench stretching along the northern part of the nave was exclusively devoted to plants of fine foliage, grouped for effect, and specimens of the tall cacti, Cape heaths, exotic orchids, nepenthes, ra the like. The show of plants of fine foliage is said to have been first encouraged by the exhibitions at the Csystal Palace. It wouli be impossible, if it were even desiralsle, in a, notice like this, to enter into anything like a critical estL mate of the separate items which made up an exhibition or tbis kind. One can but indicate the general character of tbat which should have been smen to be appreciated. It it said that on no previous occasion has there boen so large a number of competitors in the several classes, and itseems: upwards of 900L has been distribated in prizes. It is more interesting to the prizo-takers than to the general public to know how that sum ha been appropriated, ani it is therefore unnecossary to take up space with detais off that nature. From about 1 to 4 o'clock the exhibition. increased in interest. The arrival of each train added fresh acoessions to the crowd, and when nearly the whole 13,00(1 v ,itors were circulating at one time within the building thescene -a witnessed from the galleries, and heightened bythe brilliancy and variety of female costume,was extremelyanimated and picturesque. The hands of the Coldstream. Guards, the Royal Artillery, and the company played at intervals some choice selections of music, and Mr. Brown. kmith gave a performanoe uponthe magnificent organ nbwin. rourse of erection in the transept by Hessrs. Gray and Davison expressly for the comirg Handel Ftstival. This is said to be the largest instrument of the kind ia the world, and its immense power may he estimated from tha fact that whereas in the Great Exhibition of 1851 there, were sin organs, all of which could be played uimultaneousl-r without any one of them in the least interrupting the barmony of the other, the tones of this, we are assured, can h distinctly heard in the romotest,corner of the prasenL building. On Saturday, as its trmmpet-tongued musi. rolled along in Mjestiediapasons at the touch of Mr. Brownsmith, the effect was such as almost to shake the, edifice itself. The display of the great fountains took place at half-past 4. 'By that time tho day had turned rather cold, and the go eat bulk of the company contented themselves witha witcessing the spectacle from the building. A light breeie had the effect of scattering tho spray slightly, and there was an. absence of sunshine, but otherwiso tho exhibition was suficiently interestng. A considerable number of the visitors lingered in tho building, and some intho grounds, untillon& after sunset.

LONDON, MONDAY, JUE 1; 1857. There are some excellent friends of the Church of England who never will let her act for herself for any one object. They encumber her with the formalities of an overpowering courtesy, which are meant to save her the trouble of using her hands or her feet, her eyes, ears, tongue, or any natural organ that she possesses. She must not do this, and she must not do that. Other communions might do it, but she 1-no, she must not think of it; it is infra dig. for her; she is above such a thing, it is unbefitting her station and character. She must not ruffle herself, or disturb herself, or put herself out of her way for anything; activity is vulgar; aU her prestige would go if she were once seen out of breath. Save her from the degradation and indecency of seeming in earnest; she muist never risk such a shocking exposure as that. She must never do anything new, because new action, like a new word, has somewhat awkward about it; only the smooth paths of custom and necemsity allow true stateliness of step. Thus we see a number of obsequious attendauts surrounding an old dowager, ancd adjuring her by all that is sacred not to venture beyond the terrace this morning,-she must not drive out to-day because it is too hot, nor to-morrow because it is too cold; she must not think oI running risks; she must sit in her comfortable arm-chair, like a fine old lady as she is, and look out of the window. Such is the encumbering courtesy by which men of Lord DUNGANNON's school would confne and shackle everything like action in the Church of England, till they at last brought her into the same relation to the English public that the Epicurean divinities had to the world. Lord DUNGANNON is shocked that a Bishop of the Church of England should preach in Exeter-hall. But why in the world should not a Bishop preach in Exeter-hall, if he wants to preach to as large a congregation as he can, and if he can get three times as large a one there as he can anywhere else I The Church of England is sober and cautious enough in all conscience; nobody can blame her in that respect. Why, when she does once in a way happen to hit on a rather effective step, is she instantly to be sent into her shell again and told to be quiet ? But that is the very reason of the prohibition. It is effective, or it looks as if it was; the.rfore it does not suit the Church of England. That is what logicians call the major premiss in Lord DuNGANNON'S arguiMent. To his Lordship's reason there is a sort of contradiction between effectiveness and the Church of England. His idea of her is that of a stately doll, which people are to look at, but as for action it is a mistake-it is not meant for her, it is going out of her way. Here is everybody lamenting that thousands and thousands in London never enter a place of worship. We have our clergymen in the city preaching to empty pews and charity children. There is the greatest difficulty in getting people together. Everytbing is readya-the doctrine, the preacher, the discourse ;-everything, unfortunately, but the congregation. You have not the material to work upon put before you. Well, in this state of the case, an expedient is hit uponi which at any rate overcomes this primary defect-it brings people together, it gives you your congregation. You may or may not be able to do them good when you have got them, but at any rate you have got the people who are to be done good to. One would think that the presence of that important and necessary element in the work of conversion-the sinner-was a great preliminary advantage, which was worth a slight sacrifice of form. But- no, thinks Lord DU GANXoN, better to preach to ecclesiastical stone walls than to Exeter-hall souls. He is one of those spiritual physicians who kil according to the best rules of the art,. and comfort their patienta with the assurance that they are martyrs to the noble principle of professional etiquette. We must frankly, for our own part, say that we like numbers in these caus; we like to see people brought together; we like masaes. A large congregation is a stirring and stimulating soen-stirring to the teacher, stirring to the taught. We had rather, for association's sake, see it in the nave of St. Paurs than in Exeter-hall, but we had rather see it in Exeterhall than nowhere. There is an element of publicity in human nature, a tendency to the omnia magma, a sympathy with a crowd. Any large collection of the species for any solemn object is a fact which more or less affects ninety-nine men out of a hundred; it touches the feeling of kindred and race, it awakes a common interes, and expands every individual heart which beats in unison with the teene, and embraces in the idea the whole living mass around it. Undoubtedly this principle in our nature has been frightfully abused, and the history of revolutions shows how a crowd lashes itself up to fury by means of this very sympathy, showing that the principle is effective in eliciting evil as well as good. Itis indeed a formidable and powerful engine either way. But, if it has been used for evil, that is no reason why it should not be used for good, and why the preacher should not take advantage of it as well as the revolutionist. It is all very well talking about ille. gitimate excitement and false stimulus, but if you are to make an impression upon men whose religious sensibilities have been deadened by long neglect, sensualism, carelessness, and the force of custom and opinion in the particular world in which they have lived, you must in most cases have something like excitement to awaken them in the first instance, and produce the first change from apathy to feeling of some kind. It is very true that in a great number of cases-perhaps, unhappily, in the majority-these first impressions do not last, but yield to the first formidable temptation that comes. But still, though the excitement does not inure the object, you can afford to do without it; though it is not everything, it is something,-it enables you to make a beginning. What has I begun may not go on, but still it mast begin, if it is to have a chance of going on. To interfere, then, with such a great substantial advantage as is here gained-the advantage of a great mass of people, many of them of the class that never sees a clergyman, being brought under the direct influence of the Church of England pulpit and an address from a Bishop,-to interfere with such an evident advantage as this upon technical and formal grounds, does appear to be most shortsighted. But, after all, what do the formal objections amount to ? As the Bishop of LoxnDow said, these meetings are held under the special sanction of a late Act of Parliament-the "Act for the "Better Securing the Liberty of Religious "Worship." This Act was, by the fact of becoming law, incorporated into the system of the national Church, and is now part and parcel of her external discipline. There is no violation even of form, then, in such meetings as these, because your form is altered; it has received, and very properly, expansion and elasticity from tnis Act. Such meetings as these are now in full accordance with the law of the Church, with which they never were really at variance, only having had against them statute law, which law is now repealed. Again, with the Bingle exception that the building was not consecrated, the service, after all, was a regular Church service. The Litany was read and hymns were sung. If it be said why not have brought the people into the nave of St. Paul's or Westminster Abbey, the reply is obvious-that, if we are to wait tiU Deans and Chapters open those vast areas to congregational use and gifts of preaching, we may wait a long time. The present metropolitan Deans are men of liberal minds, but there appears to be some hitch. In the meantimae Exeter-hall is open, and the Bishop of LoNDox and his Episcopal helpers on this occasion are perfectly right in using it.
The discussion upon the Law of Divorce which is now proceeding in the House of Peers ought not, in sound policy, to tuirn so much upon essentials as on forms. We should be in the main disposed to leave the causes for which a Divorce may be obtained untouched, but we would place the remedy within the reach of aU classes. When that remedy is no longer considered a rich man's luxury, but one which is freely and indiscriminately dispensed to all classes of society, and when, in consequence, the views of the community are more clearly elicited as to the causes for which Divorce should be granted, it wiU be time enough to enter upon the more thorny and critical passages of the argument. If the issue be thus narrowed, the opponents of the Bill will find their embarrassments seriously. increased. It wiU be a very difficult point to maintain the position that upon such a subject there should be one law for the rich and another for the poor. It wil also not be easy to show that Divorce for certain causes is not permitted by Scripture, and that it has not been sanctioned by the custom of England. When we get beyond this point we enter upon a labyrinth of argument, in which inexperienced disputants wiU infallibly lose their way, and leave the decision at the mercy of those who are not very likely to take the view which will probably in the end be in conformity with the general opinion of the cointry. It is, we repeat it, most important the idea should go abroad that no change is intended in the Law of Divorce beyond that of placing the remedy vithin the reach of all classes. There are, indeed, one or two outlying points, which may now- be taken into consideration; but these are mere incidents to our present forms of administering justice in matrimonial causes-they are not essentials, touching the very extent and nature of the remedy itself. The chief of these is as to the propriety of retaining the civil action for damages, generally known as an action for criminal conversation. We cannot for a moment doubt that the first thought and impulse of every man whose mind and feelings are not thoroughly degraded would be to spurn the notion of compensation for an injury such as the one charged. It is aa injury for which -no relief can be afforded by a banker's check. Here, then, are two points of argument. Human nature turns disdainfully from the remedy; and then the remedy is no remedy at all. The reason why men have recourse to it is simply, such is the perversity of our judicial arrangements upon the matter, that without it they cannot proceed to that which is the Only appropriate form of reliefnamely, the dissolution of the marriage contract. It was intended, say its advocates, as a safeguard against collusion; but it is itself the greatest buttress and support of collusion. Every practitioner who has had occasion to be mixed up with the decision of s'nch cases is perfectly aware that in 90 per cent, of them damages are collusively arranged for the mere purpose of forming tho basis for subsequent proceedings in the House of Lords. The Lords require a form which, as they are pleased to say, wil be a kind'of guarantee against collusion; and thus they permit -a priind facie case against the presumption of collusion to be collusively established.. No doubt, a few questions may be asked by the Law Lords as to the actual payment of damages, but tho arrangements for evasion are so easily made that any solicitor accustomed to the practice would scarcely consider the point worthy of a serious thought. We say the action of crim. con. is a Mind, not a window,-a trap, not a security. Even thus we have not exhausted all the arguments against it. From the very nature of the remedy as at present administered, there is risk of the foulest injustice to an innocent and absent 'party. Tho woman whose presumed guilt con.stitutes the essence of the charge against the defendant is unrepresented altogether, and her character is at the mercy of two men who may be in a conspiracy to oust her from her honourable condition, or at least grievously to exaggerate her share in the dismal history of folly and crime. We presume that it is in great measaure to meet this last objection that the CHANoxxLwp has proposed to reverse the sequence of the proceedings, and to postpone the civil action for damages against the adulterer until a divorce shall in the first instance have been obtained from the Divorce Court. No doubt, this would meet the objection as far as the woman is concerned; but it seems strange, when the husband has obtained the ramedy which is the only one appropriate to the injury he has received, that then the minor remedy of a payment in money from the adulterer should be placed at his disposal. Why is he to receive this sum ? As compensation for damage inflicted upon him for the deprivation of his wife's affections-for the loss of his wife's society-for the laceration of his feelings consequent upon his wife's disgrace. But the woman is no longer his wife. She is nothing more to him than the merest stranger against whom he may rub shoulders in the street. This is a strange anomaly, and one which will scarcely be borne when it is attempted to work it out in practice. The great and overpo'rering reason, however, axgainst the retention of this disgusting form of action is, that men of clean and honest minds-men whose hearts have ever felt real affection for the person whose loss they affect to deplore-would do anything rather than have recourse to it-anything but remain the partners of a polluted existence. The mere fact that they sought such compensation would afford excellent evidence that they were not worthy of compensation at all. Another point has been raised which may also be considered an outlying one, and on this the Lords have arrived at a decision which will scarcely be maintained in the Lower House of Parliament, -we mean the decision that the adulterer shall be made amenable to criminal proceedings. If the adulterer, why not the adulteress ? Our Puritan forefathers would have so decided; but we have not adopted their practice, and we seriously doubt whether that practice can be maintained in modern times. We do not say, of course, that the adulterer and adulteress havenotbeenguiltyof amostexecrabie crime-of a crime which, if its consequences be regarded, must be considered as of the blackest dye. Still, before we resort to the incarceration of persons gtilty of such a crime, we must consider if such a measure would be in accordance with the spirit of the time and the ways of thought prevalent among Englishmen in the middle of the nineteenth century. Such a change from our former practice would be, we think, too rash, too unadvised, too sudden. Even if it is to be in the end, we had rather not rush at once into such violent extremes. The point is surrounded with difficulties. The guilt of the adulterer-ay, of the adulteress too-is of every shade and variety, but we are inclined to think that in the vast majority of cases when the wife is unfaithful the husband is not without blame. How could all such circumstances be brought before the consideration of a jury in a criminal trial? We very much doubt the safety of this experiment. There would, however, be no danger in insisting that, in all cases where the wife's property is not sufficient for her support, the Court of Divorce should be required to order that the adulterer should provide for her support. Let the alimony be furnished by the proper hand.
Mr. ELLICE and Sir GEORGB GNiv together delivered judgment pretty correctly upon the Scotch authorities on the Lunacy question last Friday. There has been, doubtless, gross neglect of the powers intrusted to them. The Sheriffs have nominaUy been licensing all the houses in which insane persons have been kept; the Board of Supervision in Edinburgh has nominally been regulating the whole treatment of the pauper insane; but, as a matter of fact, the great mass of the insane have been left, without license or any supervision whatever, to whatever treatment their friends and relatives gave them or got for them. At the same time, it must be admitted that mere powers of inspection do very little, and that the exercise of them is very uphill work, where there is not the proper idea in people's minds to begin with on the subject. Correcting and inspecting powers are effective in a h;gh state of knowledge and feeling, because you are dealing then with people who know perfectly well what they ought to do, and can therefore be made to do it, either by punishment or by expomure. But where you have, as in Scotland, a masw of insane, principaRly of the lowest class, scattered over the country, and living under the surveilance chieflyof persons of their o,wnrank,-where inanity is committed to the care of the country people of rude and wild districts, or cottagers here, there, and everywhere, who take in mad lodgers simply for pay,-in such a state of things mere powers of correction lodged in any central Board must be infinitely feeble. How can you make rough and simple peasants proper guardians of the insane ;- what idea is there in them on the subject that you can appeal to? And the remark will apply to classes above the peasant one, because on a subject like that of insanity, pre-eminently requiring to be seen in a scientific light, even the middle and educated part of the community will, unless new ideas have been given them, share to a large extent the rudeness of the views of the lowest class. Your tour of inspection, then, will bring before you cases such as these - "I know the cse of a man who was confined by bis brother, a person in good circumstances, in an outhouse, chained by the arm to a heavy chain fastened in the waU. He wL kindly treod.t as to food and c7oaa, althozgh he would not allow these to remain on him, but he suffered from theheavy chains. He had been in that condition for 3ears, when he was accideatally discovered." Now,here is a caseof excessivelycoarue treatment, evidently proceeding, not from wilful unkindness or brutality, but simply from ignorance and want of better ideas. No system of inspection can cure such treatment as this, because the man will very naturally say-c' What in the world am I to do " with this. madman ? If I let 1um go about he " will kill somebody; if I lock him up in a room "he wiU knock his head against the wrall. Then, "I cannot help it, I must chain him. He is only a " madman; it is quite a different thing chaining him " from chaining you or me." The truth is, that the rude view of a madman is that he is a brute in human shape, and with this view of him the very coarsest treatment produces no commiseration, nor exposes the keeper to any remarks from the neighbourhood. The stale of the madman.is pitied, as being a fall from humanity, but, his state granted, the treatment seems to follow as a matter of course. Again c D. T., agod 22, an idiot, reides with hh parnts at C-, in Caithnesashlre. Whe visited he was sitting by the' fire smost naked. He wasvery muoh emacltd, ad his head And legs were covered with a cutaneous eraption Hslahabits are very dirty,aend he is freaue Here is the primitive system of rude, uidu. strueted nature-correction by stripes; if you want to alter a bad habit, beat the crimal till he mendr. That is the umenlightened man's first idea of discipline, and it is evidently followed here simply because it is the only idea which these rude people have on the subject. Again "3L D., aged 25, lim with her fWther and mother at F-. They occupy a rwretched roorn on the ground floor, a portion of which, measring about 8 fee' by 5, is rudely railed off to form a cage, In which this young womau is oonfined. She lay on the bed, rolledup in the coverlet, but the bars of the cage wera so broad and the room so dark that it was impossible to tell exactly in what condition she was as to clothing and cleanliness." Here the first remark which any one wdi maike will be that the guardians, at any rate, sufer almost as much as the prisoner; so, if she is badly off, they share her lot. ARl three-the two sane parents and their mad daughter-live day and night in one ".dark"' room, of which 8 feet by 5 are apportioned to the daughter in the manner described, leaving, probably, no very large dimensions for the occupation of the parents, whoare thrust into a corner by the large cage which holds the daughter. Here is a case of treatment, then, which is based upon a very low standara of comfort in the population at large; and no inspection could substantially mend such treatment as this, because the treatment of the insane is only a slight exaggeration of the treatment which people give to themselves. This, too, is a remark which applies to a large class ef cases brought forward in this i Report, and especiaUy to cases where the subject of cleanliness comes in. The dirt which surrounds the Scotch insane is, indeed, abominable; but it is, after all, not a great advance beyond the dirt- of the lower population generally. No system of inspection could cure a bad treatment of the insane of which this lay at the bottom, because you must begin first with raising the general standard of cleanliness in the people with respect to themselves. The remarks which we have made apply in some degree to all treatment of the insane in Scotland, those of the better as well as those of the lowest clases. The Scotch public has not yet caught the true aspect in which insanity should be regarded, and, this being the case, no system of supervision and inspection could ever substantially improve their treatment of the insane. Any Board of Supervision would be stopped by the thickness of the material they had to deal with and the passive resistance of ignorance and radeness. The Board of Supervision at Edinburgh of course depends upon the reports of agents in the districts, upon subordinate officials on the spot, Poor Law officers, and parochial Boards. But these local authorities are under the same vulgar influences which affect the class they have to control. They see no particular harmi in these cases, and neither report them to the Board nlor take any steps to correct them themselves. Thus the wholo work is left to the natural temper and ideas of the people. The only arrngement which can work any real reform in the treatment of the insane in Scotland is the establishment of County and Borough Lunatic Asylums there, to be supported by rates, as in this country. This will not only furnish places under regular scientific management for the reception of the insane, but it will do what is the great thing wanted-give the Scotch a new idea about insanity and its treatment, and thus raise the standard of treatment even in private Asylums. The existing Chartered Asylums are too few to have this general effect.

WE sTUM sM SOooL.-Th ree new annual exhibitions to the Universities (either Oxford or Cambridge) have lately been awarded for the first time.

TErE PRESIDENCy oF MADRAs.-Papers relating to the revised survey and assesment of the Madras Presidency and on the Gedsvery and- Klstna Annicuts were publihbed last Saturday, en the raoti'n of Afr, Seymour, MP. They include minutes of Lord Harris on the proposed survey and assessment, dated the 26th of October, 1854, and the 12th of May, 1855, and two letters from the court of directors to the Government of Fort St. George dated tho 17th of December, 1856, and the 2d of July, 1856. The directors consider that the urgent necesity for a survey, with a view to the reassessment of the land revenue in the greater portion of the districts unider the Madras Preidency, is established beyondl all doubt; anbd they proceed to review the proposals of Lord Harris and to state tbeir approval or disapproval hereof. In conclusion they express their entire satisfaction at the liberal and enlightened spilit in which this important snbject has been discussed, and at the able and lucid manner in which the oonclusions and recommendations of Lord Harris have been placed before them. The second letter of the directors refers to the Kistna and Godavery Annicuts, THz Civm SEnvicE SUPRANNUATioN.-Thecommissioners appointed to inquire into the operation of the Superannuation Act, and to oonsider the complaints of the civil servants of the Crown with reverence thereto, have preeented their reprt to the Treasury, and'it wasissued yesterday in a blue-book for prersentation to Parliamient. The commissioners have gone very carefully through the whole case. They have taken into consideration, also, the different heads of oomplaint against the system established by the Act of 1834. They have examined into the inequality caused by the Act between the civilservauts appointed before 1829 and those appointed since that date, the former being subject to no deductions, and the latter liable to tbem, although placed upon a much less liberal scale of retiring allowance. They have considered the further inequality existing in different departments of the service, some of which, having been created since 1834, have never been placed on deductions at All. They hi.ve, moreover, fully oonsidered the expediensy or otherwise of oontinitlng a retiring provision, of establishing a special frud to provide for it, and of maling deductions from the nominal salaries of the public servants for that purpose. We find the concluslons they'havo come to upon these points may be thus brieflytated:-That retiring allowances should be continued upon the same principle as heretofore. That the salaries of the civil servants should be really what they nominally purport to' be, without abatement from that amount. That the deductions established by the Act of 1834 should therefore cease in all cases to whioh they have been applied, and that those salaries which bave been subjected to deduction, should be raised to their nominal armount. That the age at which miring allowanees may be grAuted shal commenoc at 60, instead of65, and thaCt retirement from the servie shall be compulory at the latter Age. We think- that Parliament and the public will be quite pReied to receive thsce orecomnendLtions of the oonmis. siolirs in a favourable spirit. and we are disposeda to believe. that-te service will generally be oontent %ith the onossions made. They amount to bare justioce and the puoblic 'will not begrudge the payment of tho 75,0o0f. annually, of which the civil service have bEen unfairly muleted. There is a new scale of retiring allowances recommended by teen coramissioners which is slightly more liberal thn that now inforce, althodgh less so than either of thcse po-posed -by. the original Bill of last year, or by the Parliaweuetaq comaittee. There is, however, one feature in it whiocl is obviously fair. The periodical augmentatior of the allow e for length of service talkee place by an equal annual luce.-e meat, commencing At 10 years insteoa of, as at present,.by a greater rise for evry additional seven years. On the whole, we regard the recommendations of the coimmiioners aa satisfactory, andl shallI ho glad to see them restive thu - muction of Parlivneut.o1*rrr 06knv+

GREAT Loss OF LIFE oN T LICA snTn AwD ULVERSTO0N SANDS.-Daring Friday night or early on Saturday morning several perdons were drowned on the sands betweenLmucaster and lverstone. On Saturdayevening, when our report was of necessity despatched, it was not known at IAncaster -what was the precise number of those who had lost their lives, but there was reason to suppose that it waa not less than 14, and the bodies of eight of the deceased had been ro20vered, having been washed ashore at Hest-bank, about tbaee miles from lancaster. It was at this point that the facb of the calamity first becaTne known on the morning of Saturday. From the san4s. which it will be remembered, skirt Morecanibe-bay, there were seen floating i tho water a number of men's hats, some boxes, and other things, and it was at once conjectured that the hats, boxes, &c., were the property of persons who, in crossing the sand, had either been overtaken by the tide or bad left the proper track and so got into the water. A number of men went out in boats and recovered the hats and boxos, and a further search revealed the bodiesof eight men floating as nearly together as possible. They were brought ashore, and in the coure of the day recognized; and it was rumoured at this place that at Silverdale, two or three miles higher up the sandR, some bodies had been washod ashore. It is believed that all the persons who have lost thoir lives ar single young men, in service. Some persons suppose that there were two young women with them, but owing to the difficulty f obtaining iaformation from the other side of the sands our correspondent had not learnt whether this was true. Suffice it that & party of more than a dozen persons who bad been living in seorvioe at Poulton, lle3shalm, and other places on the Ulverstone end of the sands, left Kent'sbank on Friday night, intending to be prevent at the Whitsuntide hirings at lancaster on Saturday. Their route was along tbes asds by the edge of the bay, being the same that itan by the over-sands coach between lv4rstone and Lancaster. The party sent sometime drinkiug at Willcocksks Kent's-bank Hol, and they Artea in twoight one-horse carts. According to the tide-table it Wa hligh. water at Ulverstone on Saturdiymorning at 10 3inutes n:at 4 o'clock, a- d in order to cro the snds in safet and avoidt tide the journey should bave been ooxntnncedoaat either end at 41 minutes past 9 o'clock on Fridiy asgkt; but this party, besides being intoxicated, are understood to bsvestarted later by an houror more. Some who intended to hare crossed with them declined to do so beoause f the time they started, and so saved their lives. INothiugn more is known of the party until the bodies of some of them were washed ashore as already described. We have omitted to niention that at Rest, along with the bodie,was recovered on Saturday oneof the carts with the lifeleFshorseattxched to it.

TEIIR GRAND DUKE CONSrANTINE. EiH Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Contautine of Russia arrived at Osborne on a visit to Her Majesty on Saturday afternoon. As anticl. 2ated by our Fiiday's report no public ceremony or display of any kind took place on this occasion, us the visit was of a strictly private character, and -o very brief in its duration that long ere this notice -is in the hands of our readers his Highness will ihave quitted England and be far on his way to -Calais. The Grand Duke arrived at Cherbourg in the W'renoh Emperor's yacht, Reine Hortense, at 7 o'clock on Friday morning last. The weather at that port was most unfavourable for a visit of inspection-a keen wind blew, and the rain fell heavily throughout the day. Nevertheless his Highness disembarked at the 'dockyard at 10 o'clock, and remained till 1, minutely inspecting its various departments, -vhen he rode through the town, and again returning to the dockyard embarked in a mnail screw brig of war, and visited the break"water at the mouth of the harbour. On this he 'remained upwards of an hour, examining the -forts, &c., and returned again to the dockyard at -4 o'cloek to witness the hauling up of a 40-gUtn -rigate by iueans of the hydraulic heaving.-upslip. sThis was, we believe, the first timethe experiment of 'hauling up so large a vessel had been tried, and the result was perfectly successful. In the evening the Prefect gave a splendid -entertainment at his official residence, to which -all the heads of departments at Cherbourg, with Captain Seymour, of the Admiralty yacht Osborne, -were invited to meet the Imperial visitor. Soon after ]O o'clock the Grand Duke embarked ' -rom the chore in the French Admiral's barge, 'end returned on board the Reine Hortense. Here his Highness took a fornal leave of the *4officers of the Tmperial yacht, which he quitted -soon after, and at once proceeded on board the -Osborne. A discharge of rockets was fired from the Reine Rortense as the Grand Duke went down -the side, aind on board the Osborne he was received -with gunwales manned and "1 long lights" burning. "The ussian frigate Aurora, which during the late war led our cruisers such a weary dance and so adroitly escaped themn all, had been '8tayig in the harbour at Cherbourg, but -eailed thence before the Grand Duke arrived. His iHighness slept on board the Osborne on Friday 'might, and quitted Cherbourg at 6 on Satur'4day morning with a light wind, clear, fine weather, snd the sea as calm as a millpond. No -ealutes were fired, either by the garrison or '-ships in port as the Osborne steamed out. The yacht made a remarkably fine and quick -passage across. While en route, afterbreakfast, his Highness expressed a wish that the -officers of the Osborne should be presented to -bim, and Captain Seymour accordingly presented Mr. G. H. K. Bower, Master, R.N., commanding -the Osborne (who was Master of the Agamemnon, nunder Admiral Lyona, when she "went in' at 'Sebastopol, at the bombardment), and whom the Grand Duke asked if he did not find himself in a very "hot berth ;" Mr. Pym, additional master; Mr. Gow, Chief Engineer; and Lieutenant Robin-son, of the Victorv, who accompanied Captain Say* mour. The Osborne arrived off Hurst Castle at half-past 12 o'clock, and was saluted by the garrison with the usual 21 guns. The only man-of-war at this place was the little Alban steam vessel, Lieutenant De Blaquiere, which manned yards as the yacht approached, but did not salute, as no vessel under ten guns is allowed the honour of paying gunpowder compliments. A look-out man was stationed at Hurst Castle, by whom the approach of the yacht was signalled to -Osborne, and Her Majesty was thus informed of the arrival of her Imperial visitor almost as soon as the Osborne came in slght. Near Cowes was lying the IJnited States' paddlewheel frigate Susquehanna, recently arrived in order -'to assist in laying down the Atlantic sabmarine telegraph cable. This was the first vessel to salute the Grand Duke on his arrival in England. The Osborne neared her at 12.55, when Captain Sands immediately beat to quarters, manned yards, and saluted with 21 guns in splendid style. In order to give the Grand Duke an opportunity of seeing this fine frigate, the Osborne steamed very slowly past her, -o that his Highness had then a good view of one of the best and heaviest armed paddle war steamers ahloat. The Susquehanna is 2,436 tons burden, with a nominal horse-power of 950, and a crew of 320 men. Her extreme length over all is 280ft. 9in. ; breadth, 45ft.; depth, 26ft. 6in., and draught of water when fully laden with stores, ammunition, &c., nearly 19ft. Her armament is, for a vessel of her class and size, unusuaUy heavy. She carries 12 8-inch broadside shell guns, each nine feet long, and weighing 63 cwt. In addition to this metal she has three 'pivot guns, two forward and one aft, each 10 feet 10 inches long, weighing 105 cwt. and throwing an S-inch solid shot. She is bark-rigged, and has a noble fighting deck with roomy quarters for her guns and ample space for stowage below. Her only drawback seems her height from the water, the forward ports being 15 feet 6 inches, and the aft (litto 14 feet. To counterbalance this defect in her construction, which makes her heavy aloft and imparts a hideous wlaU-sided look, she has no bulwarks, or at least what are equivalent to none-merely, canvas bulwarks. While saluting on Saturday the Russian flag 'was run np at the main, and the band on deck played the Russian National Anthem. The Royal yacht squadron battery at Cowes also saluted as the Osborne passed, and soon after Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, anchored near Osborne, paid the same compliment, with manned yards and ship dressed. The yacht arrived off Osborne at 1.25. Captain the Hon. Joseph Denman immediately put off in the Queen's barge, and landed his Highness on the beach, -where a guard of honour of the 93d Highlanders, under Captain Middleton, was drawn up. Eis Highncss looked at the Highlanders wvith an expres,sion tbat plainly betokened considerable interest andadmiration. M. Sabourofl'M. Golovnine, M. Haurowri'i Colonel De Greig, aide-de-camp, Prince Ouchtomsky, and eleven inferior attendants, landed with the Duke. Carriages wrere snvwaitmigupon the beach to convey the party to 'Osborne-bousEe. Yesterday afternoon, at 4 30, Her Majesty, his Royal Highness Prince Albert, the G}rand Duke Constantine, and his Royal Hiighness the Duke of Cambridge, embarked on board the Victoria and Albert yacht, which at once stood -away towards Spithead. The keen look-out kept -on board the squadron detected the Royal yacht before she had moved two lengths from Osborne. The ships vwere moored in two lines, and the CJolossus, Exmouth, Archer, Malacca, and Brisk, beat to quarters, and got ready to salute, while the crews of the Vesauvins, Devastation, Volcano, Rolla, and Sealark stood ready to man yards. As the Royal yacht approache*, with the Russian ensign at the fore and the Royal standard at the main, the salute wfas thundered out *from the checkered aides of the squadron in beautiful -order, both large and small ships manning yards, with the standards of Russia and England at the fore and main. The unwonted sound of a itoyi slut irin te suadon n a undy ate. Royal smluto from the squadon- _o_n a Su`n_day aftser-noon brou,ht all the loungers of Portsmouth to the beach. The garrison should have saluted -from the King's bastion, but were prevented by the rapid progress of the Royal party, who were icarcely reported as abreast of the town ere the yacht had flown to Spithead. The men of the Artillery were mustered in hot haste and 'brought down to the harbour at a hard gallop, but by that time the Victoria and Albert was past the Nb Light, and for all the attention the aalute wouild have commanded it might as vell have ,been fired at the Tower. The yacht then stood well out to sea. We believe it had been intended that the Royal party should have * made a trip round the island, but a stiff breeze blew outside, with a heavy swell, so that after steaming out about'20 miles the yachts head was -put about, and she returned throuigh Spithead, the 'same ceremonies being observed as she repassed the squadron. ImmediAtely after landing his Highness the yacht came into harbour to replenish coals. She then again returned to Osborne, where the Grand Duke and suite, 'we believe, re-embarked last evening, aud dlept on board. She wag to leave at sunrise this (Monday) morning, so as to save the tide into Calais Harbour at 7 the same evening.

(From the Court Circular.) l HiB Imperial lighness the Grand Duke Constantine arrived at Osborne yesterday, shortly before 2 o'clock, attended by M. de Sabouroff, M. de Golovnine, M. de Haurowiz, M. de Greig (Colonel, A.D.O.), and Prince Ouchtomsky (Lieutenant de Vaisseau, A.D.C.) The Grand Duke crossed over from Cherbourg in the Admiralty yacht Osborne, on board of which Captain J. H. Seymourr, Flag Captain at Portsmouth, was iu attendance on his Imperial Highness. On the approach of the Osborne to Osborne-pier Her Majesty's ship Eurydice saluted the Russiau flag, and the Queen's barge from the Royal yacht vent alongside to disembark his Imperial Highness, who, on landing, was received on the pier by his Royal H1ighness Prince Albert, accompanied by the Prince of Wales and Prince Alfred. Count Chrep~ towicb, the Russian Minister, was also at the pier, to pay his respects to the Grand Duke. The Royal party and the suite immediately got into Her Majesty's carriages, which were in waiting, and drove to the house, the Graud Duke, the Prince, the Prince of Wales, and Prince Alfred occupying the first carriage. The Qaeen received His Imperial Highness at the hall-door, accompanied by the Princes-es, the Duchess of Kent, and the Duke of Cambridge, and attended by the Ladies and Gentlemen in Waiting. The Earl of Clarendon was also present. The gentlemen of the suite were presented to Her Majesty by the Grand Duke. A guard of honour of the 93d Eigblanders was formed on the lawn near the house. In the afternoon the Queen and Prince, accompanied by the Grand Duke and the Duke of Cambridge, walked and drove in the grounds. Count and Countess Chreptowich and Viscount Palmerston arrived yesterday on a visit. The Royal dinner party in the evening included his Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Constantine, their Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Kent, the Priucess Royal, and the Duke of Cambridge; his Serene Highness Prince Leiningen, the Russian Minister and Countess Chreptowich, the Earl of Clarendon, Viscount Palmnernton, Lady A. Bruce, Captain J. H. Seymour, R.N., M de Sabouroff, M. de Golovnine, M. de Haurowiz, Colonel Greig, and Prince Ouchtomsky, in waiting to the Grand Duke, and Colonel Tyrwhitt. The band of the Royal Marines played a selection of music during dinner. Major-General the Hon. C. Grey and Mrs. Grey had the honour of being invited in the evening.
I THE MA NCHESrB EXHIBITION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have conversed with many people who have visited the beautiful collection of pictures at Manchester; I have spent two days there myself. [ have not met with a single person who does not coincide with me in thinking that it is most desirable that the name of the painter of each work of art, and the subject of it, should be inscribed in legible letters on its frame. It would take many weeks to examine thoroughly that vast coUection with a catalogue; most visitors have but a few days, many but a few hours, to devote to that purpose. It is undeniable that at least half their time is wasted in obtaining from a catalogue printed in small type and not very readily understood as to its plan information which might thus instantaneously be conveyed to them without any fatigue of eyesight orloss of time whatever. I cannot believe that the spirited individuals who have done so much honour to themselves and their city by their spendid and successful enterprise will withhold such a great convenience from theio visitors for the sake of gaining a few pounds per week by the sale of catalogues. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. 13L
WIVES VERSUS MOTHERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIE ES. Sir,-In the debate on the Divorce and Matrlmonial Causes BiU, now under discussion in the Committee of the House of Lords, one very important feature of the cuse seems to be entirely lost sight of. Our legislators are, we are assured, anxious to make amends for past wrongs and to relieve the weaker sex from the oppressive, and (as Lord Brougham calls them,) the barbarous laws which have hitberto been in force. But though the change projectod will be an inestimable boon to the oppressed, the i-nused, the deserted wives of England, what will it avail to such of them as are mothers unless the question respecting the right of guardiansbip of the children bo also taken into consideration ? Lord Lyndhurst and others who, like bim, are the guardians and bulwarks of justice, bave rightly observed that " Such is the horror of most women at any publcity being given to wrongs of this nature that only in extreme cases would the relief now projected be resorted to ;" but even in these extreme cases, when every conceivable outrage is heaped upon her devoted head, will the injured wife forget that sbe is a mother? Will she forget that her presence still serves to protect, in some degree, the purity of the domestic hearth, and to guard her children from familiarity with vice, and in its most revolting form, which she knows full well will be forceduponthei the moment the protecting shield of the mother's presence is withdrawn? Through your influential Journal, which has ever been the champion of the oppressed and the advocate of justice, let this faet be made known, that the mother will nerve herself to bear what to the wife is intolerable, and tbat, lnless some scheme be devised to withdraw the children from the guardianship and companionship of the bratal or the adulterous father, any plan for redressing the wrongs of wives will be fubile, for they will never forget-and le not our leeislators forcet- th: thav ,A - -0- A WIFE, BUT ALO A MOTHERa Alay 29.
DIVORCE A VINYCULO. TO TaE EDITOR OF THE TIMEI. Sir,-Perhaps the following extract from Bishop Burnet on the 25th article of the church may-not be out of place at this time in your columns:- " Our Savionr when he blamed the Jews for their frequent divorces established this rule,-that ' Whosoever puts away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery.' Which seems to be a plain and full determination that in the caseof fornicationhe may put her away and marry another. It is trme St. Mark. and St. Luke repeat these words without mentioning the exoeption ; so somo have thought -we ought to bring St. Matthew to them and not them to St. Matthew. But it is an uni- ersal rule of expounding scriptures, that when a p lace is ully set down by one inspired 'writer, and less fully by another, that the place which is less foil is always to be expounded by that whieh is snore foil." (Bieshop Lurnlet on, he Ashdese. Page's edition, p. S77.) These fewwordis seem tome to set the scriptural argument respecting divorce " a vincsu " in a much clearer light than any of the references mado by the bishops In the House to the Reormatio Legum, St. Augustine, or any "'whole string of fathers." I am, Sir, yours, &c. .3L A. I I -'UMLJj-IEUX uLw j, iuay 4UJ.
THB CAPE COLONY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It gave me, and I bave little doubt many others, great pleasure to read the common sense andtruthful letter of your correspondent " Esperanza " in your impresdon of yesterday. Having myself resided on the immediate frontier during the rule of the two previous Governors, I can fully corroborate the remarks made by your correspondent; and I think Sir G. Grey deserves great praise for the masterly manner in which he is conducting the affairs of the colony. W'hatever may be the opinion of MAr. Adderley and some few others in the House, I know that on the frontier itself, at the latest dates, the generad feeling of the colonists was one of admiration of the Governor's policy; in confirmation of. which, thinking they may prove interesting to some of your readers, I annex extracts of two letters to hand per lpst mail. They are from old colonists, and being written for private perueal, are the more interesting and worthy of belief:- "Grahahms Town, Mfarch 3,1t57.

SOCIETY OF VEMALE ARTISTS. The gallery of pictures formed under the auspices of the society to which we referred last week as openiug a new and honourable channel to female industry and talent will be exhibited to the public to-day (Monday). On Saturday, after the precedent usually adopted in the case of pictorial exhibitions, a few persons were admitted to a private view. The works collected are upwards of 350 in number, including original paintings it oil and water, copies from the old masters, and a few specimens of sculptire. Such a revelation of artistic enterprise on the part of the fair sex is, of itself, a remarkable fact, and there is no apparent reason that it may not prove the beginning to a great result. Nor have the artists confined their energies to the mere ladylike branches of art-to the production of fruit and flower pieces. Pictures on these delicate saubjects are, ideed, more numerous than in other galleries, and Mrs. V. Bartholomew, long distinguished in the department, contributes her fruit piece with the rest, gaining for herself a distinction by the natural character of her dainties, which stand in sober contrast to some of the gayer and less truthful combinations of plums, grapes, and melons. Of historical sttbjects in oil the specimens are sufficiently numerous to show a widespread ambition among the lady artists. The " ighland Emigrants" of Mrs. M'Ian is an elaborate composition, in which a great many figures are combined, and in which much feeling is expressed. The boat is setting off crowded with emigranbt, the friends on the shore are3 taking leave, and in this theme ample varieties of sympathy and distress are introduced. The "May Queen" (after Tennyson) of Mrs. E. Mx Ward is above the average level of the domestic class. The village beauty, whose face, all sunles, is reflected from her mirror, is well contrasted by the anxious mother, who amid the gaieties of "part the first" of the poem, is evidently anticipating the sorrows of "part the third." Miss E. Bradstreet produces an " Australian Buabranger" full of life and vigour, and dashed off with a masculine recklessness of manipulation. The sympathies connected with the Crimea have not, of course, been overlooked. Miss Sophia Sinnett shows a family engaged in reading a list of killed and wounded with an anxiety amounting to absolute fright, and Mrs. Musgrave solemnly tells (in watercolour) the anecdote of a Hghland soldier who brings to the widow of his slain officer the favourite dogs of the deceased. Most ambitious is Mrs. Blackburn, who selects the ill-starred Phaeton for her subject, and shows him just at the moment when the power of his horses is greater than his own. Her bold experiments in foreshortening are tried on the steeds, which fling themselves out in every possible attitude, while the hapless driver is scared out of his wits. The landscapes in oil are of course numerous, but not so preponderating as might be expected. Miss Frances Stoddart, in a true artistlike style, produces bright views that would be conspicuous in any exbilition, and Miss Margaret Witcomb shows " A Short Way to the Village," streaked over with shade and suniiht, that might have come from the pencil of Mr. Lea. Another accomplished landscape painter is Miss Yetts, who evidently prides herself on her minute reproduction of foliage. Children occupy an important position in the allery, several of the fair artists having obviously devoted themselves to the contemplation of infantine life. Mrs. E. Ward sends forth tbree several pictures, representing a little "YMaria," a lttle " Flora," and a little "Alice and Leslie" (the last two in one' frame), artificially coloured, indeed, but full of juvenile character, and big with juvenile plumpness. Generally speaking, the colouring of the oil paintings is not rich, but a certain timidity, or a desire to tone down, seems more or less prev a- lent. A brilliant exception will be found in the head of a "Christian Woman of Nazareth," by Ms. Roberton Blaine-but one exception proves a rule. In the water-colour department, on the other hand, there is every appearance of unrestrained vigour. Of those smooth landscapes ofthe drawingmaster school that are amply represented every year at the galleries of the " Old" and " New" Society there are comparatively few, and we may fairly say that the fair artists have rather a tendency to imitate the dashing manner of Mr. David Cox than to luxuriate over those soft conventionalities which seem created for portfolios. The "fir trees" of LadyBelcher, the view of " Matlock" by Miss Mandeville, the rains of an "Inn in Carmarthenshire" by Miss Emma Kenyon, and the " Still Day in October" by Miss Florence Peel, are all good specimens of that daring grasp of effect that distinguishes the best masters of water-colour landscape. The view on the Thames, at Kew, in which an "sit" over-grown with trees is the principal object, combines the 'same natural vigour with a high degree of finish. The artist, Miss Marianne Stone, also indulges in careful studies of still life; and the basket of new laid-eggs,j which she throws in as a make-weigh' to her landscapes, will remind many of the happy imitative pictures of Mr. W. Hunt. Surpassing all in industry is Miss Elizabeth Murray, who has drawn (by command) a full-length portrait of King Otho, in Greek costume, and covers a large surface of wall and screen with all sorts of figures-Greek, Moorish, and Spanishthat admit of gay and fantastic dress. Miss Murray is a sketcher of the first class, and the strong characteristic effects that she produces with a few strokes of the pencil are really surprising. In landscapes and works that require regular composition she is less satisfactory. A view of Funchal, in Madeira, rather resembles the casual patterns found in a kaleidoscope than any object in nature, and even the figures at a distance seem broken up into glittering fragments. The sketches of humanlife, on the other hand, .sketchy though theyare, have all the completeness of a happy thought flung upon the paper without passing through any distorting medium. The sculptural department is about as largely represented as at the British Institution, and consists in a great measure of portraits. Mrs. Thorneycroft, who has produced likenesses of the Queen and the Duchess of Gloceater, is the most liberal contributor. The copies from the 61d masters form byino means the least interesting portion of the exhibition. Raffaeile's "Belle Jardiniere," by Miss O'Grady; the " Head of Rembrandt" and the "Cattle," after Cuyp, by Miss M. J. Chapman, are not only careful and conscientious studies, but are remarkable for the felicity with which the ladies have caught the tone of the originals. Miss Chapman has not only imitated the manner of Cuyp, bat has even indicated the mellowing effects of time. No one who pays London a visit during the season should omnit a visit to this very interesting collection. It is the first broad demonstration of a talent that has hitherto appeared in scanty and isolated specimens. That we had lady-artists of course everybody knew, but that we had ladyartists who could fill a large room in Oxford-street with creditable works is a fact that is now made known for the first time.

Tho whole of the officers and men of the Royal MIarines at present stationed at head-quarters at hatham were a few days ago assembled on their parade-ground for the pur. pose of witnessing the presentation of a silver medal, together with a gratuity of 151, which had been awarded by the Lords of the Admiralty to Colour-Sergeant B. Matthews, of the Chatham division, for long service and meritorious conduct. The division having been formed into square, Colonel E. A. Parker, the commandant, advanced to the centre, and, addressing the troops, exhorted them to imitate the example of Sergeant Matthews, whose good conduct had secured for him the highest mark of distinction which it was in thepower of the Admiralty to bestow upon him. The gallant Colonel then presented the medal to Sergeant Matthews, who has been 22 years In the corps of Royal Marines, and who only lately returned, in the Winchester, from China, where he had been serving in the Bittern since 1852. On Saturday morning an order was received at Chatham garrison from the War-office, directing that the name of Captain W. Nott, 83d Regiment, instructor of musketry to the provisional battalion, be withdrawn from the list of officers under orders to embark for India. The enrolled pensioners of the Chatham division having completed their usual period of training were inspected on Saturday morning on Chatham lines by Major R. Jenkins. The manceuvring of those veterans and their steadiness under arms elicited the warmest expressions of approval from Major Jenkins and the other officers who were present i upon the occasion. The dep6t of the 93d Highlanders, numbering 75 non. commnissioned officers and men, arrived at Chatham garrison from Dover on the afternoon of Saturday,for the purpose of joining the provisional battalion. The following officers accompanied their dep6ts :-Captain G. ML Brown, Lieu. tenant G. I. Fenwic]X and Lieutenant A. 0. Tabhute. The old colours of the regiment have been left with the depOt for the purpose of being hung in Glasgow Cathedral. The non-commissioned officers and men of the following dep6ts stationed at Chatham have completed a course of Enfield rifle instruction, previous to their embarcation to join their service companies in India--iz, the dep6ts of the 8th, 10th, 86th, and 87th (Royal Irish Fusileera) Regi. ments.

The United States' paddlewheel steam-frigate Susquehana Captain Joshua Sands, after saluting the Grand Dake Constantine's flag, as noticed in ourreport of his Imperial EHighness's visit to Osborne, proceeded to Gravesend. Tho fol. lowing paticulars with reference to the construction of this frigate may be of interest to our readers --She has four tubular boilers fitted athwart ships, with upright tubes, the water lying around them. Theso boilers were constructed on a newr plan by the chief engineer of the lUnited States' navy, and were made at Baltimore; this is the first ship, with the exception of tho Merrimac, which has been fitted with them. Her average consumption of coals (of which she stowa away 1,000 tons) is about 35 tons for the 24 hours, which amount produces an average speed of 10 knots an hour under steam alone. Her cylinders are 6 feet in diameter, 10 feet stroke, carrying from 121b. to 181b. pressure of steam, 151b. being the average; average revolutions, 15 or 16. She has several officers on board, who have come over to this country to render their assistance in laying down the great Atlantic telegraph cable. The Agamemnon, Master Commander Cornelius T. A. Noddall, reported as having left for Birkenhead, was re called when between the Great Nore and the Mouse, in consequence of a telegraphic despatch from the Admiralty, ordering her to remain at the* Nore until further orders. She is to take in that portioR of the cable intended to have been taken by the Niagara, and the St. Jean D'Acre is to proceed (when ready) to Birkenhead, The Cyclops paddle wvheel steam frigate LieutenantCommander Joseph Day¢man, left Sheerness on Saturday lest, for thce purpose of taking soundings of the line along which it is proposed the great Atlantic telegraph cable should be laid down. The Cumberland, 70 guns, Captain J. B. Dickson, left Sheerness yesterday, in obediewce to a telegraphic order from the Admiralty, for Portsmouth, where she is to remain until her full complement of men has been obtained, A general muster and inspection of the steam squadron of reserve at Sheerness vwill take place to.day.
MrLITARY MESS ExPE.DiTuRE.-Our anticipation that his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief would grapple ere long with the monster " mess expenditure" has been realized. An order has gone forth for a rigid limitation of the charges for the dinners, and for the exclusion from the mess table of such expensive wines as claret and champagne. Two shilings per diem is to be the maximum nrice for each officer's dinner, and in considera. tion of the means of subalterns the Prince Regent's allowance for wine, of which only a portion of the officers were accustomed to partake, is to be appropriated to the common use in reducing the actual expense of each officer to Is. (6d. Thus each infantry subaltern wiUl have 3a. 9d. per diem for tho other necessaries of life. Every father who has a son in the army who regalarly calls upon him to contribute something to the youmg officer's ex nses must feel extremely grateful to the Duke of Cambridge for this bold and happy innovation upon long-established usages and abuses. Tley had reached an alarming height. Every week's GareUe announced three or four resignations or removals, the Horse Guiards was regularly besieged -with complaints from creditors or parents, and there was hardly a commanding officer who was not pestered with representations of one kind or another arising out of the embarras3ments of the junior officers. We dare say that in some corps, where money is abundant and the habits of luxury ingrained, the limitations wfll be unpalatable, but, generally speaking, the measure mnst be popular. Every officer ought to take a pride in seconding the efforts of the Commander-in-Chief to benefit the service, and in showing that he (the junior) can be as well content to dine off the joint as the retired generals who take their daily refection at the club. Betides, Sir Colin Campbell is sure to detect the slightest symptom of triclcery, and it is certain, as he makes thediscovery of any attempt to baffle the wishes of the Comsnander-in-Chief, tbat condign punishment will follow. The " Mess," although in its extravac,ance a groat evil, is not the only souree- of -expenditure which it has become necessary to destroy. There are many other indulgences, to the root of which the axe must bo appUed. lNeverthe. less, the reduction of mess luxtries forms a good beginning, A thrifty habit introduced into one branch of outlay induces a corresponding modification of expenditurein otfer superfluities. The British officer, finding that he cannot make a display in one branch of his " domestic economy," will discard pretension in others. His mufti and his dogeart, his stakes at ecarte, his hospitalities in his quarters and in the country hotels, will come to he looked at as foUies.: and in the fulness of time we sball find him admitting. practicaUy, that simplicity of life in garrison is as becoming in the soldier as courage and endurance in the field--United Scrvice Gaaeute. ExTrx srvE ROBBERY BY MoicmoNS.-On MIonday last a number of Mormons left Mnsfield, Nottinghamshire, for Liverpool, en route for Utah. Among them was a man named Robert Wright, who was one of the ezecutive officers of an Odd FleUows' lodge held at the Angel Inn, the funds of which were kept in a strong box, locked with three locks, each key being in the poSFession of a different member, one of whom wa Wright. Among the papers and money was a check for 2181., ready drawn and s gged.

Sr. JAAMB!SS THEATRZ. Mademoiselle Corally Gufroy, vwho first appeared in Paris two mRonths ago in a little opera entitled Dragonaee, and achieved therein a distinguished success, made her London dWbiU on Saturday in the same piece, and -wag honoured with universal applaue. Dragonette is a young ladyof the " daughter,of the regiment" sehbol, who, having been broughtup by an old sergeant, affects military propen sitles, and dresses in a style approaching that of an ideal; ized sutler. In the course of events the education of Dragonette proves to be higblyserviceable. Her brother absent without leave, is in peril of condemnation as a deserter, but as she strongly resembles him, she is able by assuming his attire to take his place, and thus conceal his delinguency. In keeping up tho soldier-like character, she contrives to pick a quarrel with a conscript dancing-master, about the affections of a cantinire, and, as she faints during the duel that ensues, her trune character is discovered. Fortunately the absent brother returns in time to avoid all unpleasant consequences, and a pretty effect is produced at the end of the piece by the two striplings (male and female) rushing into each other's arms. Thb great feature in this 1lesknt trifle is the impersonation of the heroine by =odmeisele Corally Guffoy, who extremely youthful in sppearano% represents firat the military girl and sfterwards the soldier boy in the prettiest manner possible 'AlU the littCe ecliaritiesthat have been hitherto employed to render camp beauties objects of general interest are bestowed upon Dragonette.; and whethershemarohesplayfnUyaboet, coaxes theold sergeat, otbeomes nonsforthefate of herbrother, there is a fascination in her deportment that is hard to describe. 3M Guyot, who represents the old sergeant, 'ives an exeollent licture of that popular kind of militaryero who belonge to the days of the first French empire, and the dancing-master and ncinti7Ars are represented -with mutch grotesque humour by M. Taian and 31 Leonce. The music, wrhich is by Herr Offenbach. Is o thabt playfully martial character wrhich is so highly relished in lFrench comlcopera, and is sung in the best spirit by all the characters.
AM. BURFOBD'S PANORAMA. The subject of Mr. Burford's new picture, exhibited for the first time on Saturday, Is a place less familiar to the general public than any that he has depicted for severai years. However, Sierra leone has its own body of sympa. thizers, who respect it as the head-quarters of the anti. slavery movement, and the provincial frequenters of the " May meetings," if they have not already quitted London, will no doubt bo gratified to take a bird's-eye view of a city in which the chief edifices seem devoted to missionary enterprise. The point of view wbch M1r. Barford has Elected fally commands Freetown, the metropolis of the colony, which appears on the seaboard as the one inhabited spot amid a vast expanse of luxuriant land spreading in all directions, till the prospect is closed by the mountains in the distanco. That variety Which Mr. Bnr. ford oonstantly obtainswhen an Europeau city is his subject, and he can place the town on one side of his picture and the country on the other, is not afforded by a region in which the two grand objects are the sea and the spreading plain. But, as a beautiful landscape, of a kind totally different from those with which ordinary folks are acquainted, the panorama of Sierra Leone is worthy of comparison with any of the works that have preceded. It is a fine fresh picture of grassy land and blue water, refreshing to those who would seek a moment's relief from tumultuous London in the height of the " aeason2"
CGRMORNE G.ABDBNS. Although this favourite place of amusement has been open for several weeks, and on account of the recent fineness of the weather haa to some degree anticipated the summer season, it is not till Whitsuntide that the " grand" opening takes place. Extensive preparations have beea made to meet the pleasure-seeking propensities .of the holyday folks. The Marionettes, which were exhibited a few years go in the Adelaide Gallery, vill reappear to-night in a new theatre which has been erected for them at the end of the large lawn, and is capable of holding pwrards of 700 persons. Equestrian performances have alwas been among the principal amusements of Cremorae, and for this present Whitsuntide the Circus has been provided with a new front, and 'with two " day and night pictures " representing two persons famous for tbeLr steeds-viz., the late Yr. Ducrow and Gaido's " Aurora." That the gardens may not be without a " 0olossal painting" Mr. Jones has produced a view of the ]uins of Rome, 90 feet long and hal as many in height, extending from the principal ' AsI burnham entrance" to the "refreshment oowers" stationed round the orchestra. To the Chinese platform, sacred to Terpsichorean rites, the new art of crystal illutnination has been liberally applied. A new ballet, entitled the Gipsy Girl, is another novelty of the season.
GOOD CONDUCT PAY OF SERGEANTS IN THE ARMY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-I am sure it was with the utmost pleasure that tho sergeants throughout the army were made aware through the Parliamentary Intelligence of 27ne Times of tho 29th of May that a question had been put in the House of Commons by Sir J. Trelawny with reference to their good conduct pay; but great and general is the disappointment at the result. There is no wvant of grateful feeling to Sir J. Trelawny for having interested himself on our behalf, bat his question does not meet the exigencies of the case, and enabled Sir J. Ramsden to reply that all was quite correct, an d that there was no injustice in the working of the circular alluded to; in fact, so vague and unsatisfactory, though apparently fair, is his answer, on the part of the War-office authorities, that it is to be feared the subject will be considered as finally disposed of by all who are not practically acquaiuted with the regulations affecting the good condaet pay of soldiers, more particularly the recent order relating to sergeants, of 'which the annexed is a copy:- " Circular No. 3 Good Conduct Fay. War-o'Pee Jon. 16. "Str,-TheSBcretarrof State for Warhavinghadunder isoonsldera. tion the c3 es of soldiers promoted to the rank of aergeant who at the time of their promotion are In recelpt of extra raks ot pgy grantea by the Good COoduct W,rrant ef the Sth of Jucly 181. andwbichextra rates under present resulat ions lapse upon pro;eotion, I amn direced to acquaint you that Lord Pannomi has boee p!ead, with a Tiew of rewarding those who by th elr geod conduct have obtAinel the rank of sergeint andof enoourAgiLg other soldir Lo ende%voar by good eon. duct to obtain similar pro'co tion, to allow, from the 1st inA, al sgeants now serving. ad at l who may be hereatter promoted, to retain, in addditton to the e,tabllobed pay of their rank, the good oDnduot pay of wvhih they wero, or ray be, in poeslon at the date ot thele promotlon. "To General Officers, &o'. According to the Good Conduct Warrant of the 8th of July, 1848. soldiers under the rank of sergeant whose conf duct entitles them to the benefit receive Id. a-day goodconduct pay on completing five years' service, 2d. after 10 ears', and so on ;,but on promotion to the rank of sergeant (prior to the above order) this advantage ceased, although the pay of the superior rank is really worse than that of the rank and file. The sergeants of the army had therefore long looked forward for a regulation to give them the benefit of their former and continued good conduct, but on tho appearance of the sbove circular its injustice and putial consideralion caused tie most thorough dissatisfaction. even to those who received the imperfect boon it affords. That its entire action is anomalous the following instances will sbow *- I Suppose two men eDlist in 1836, one is promoted sergeant before he had served five years, and could therefore have had no claim to good conduct pay when promoted; the other obtains similar rank after having served 15 years, aud for service, as a privato or corporal was in possession of 3d. a-day good conduct pay, which by the order of the 16th of January last he is now allowed to receive though a sergEant. Is it fair that the former should receive no advantage for his 20 years' good conduct, because he has held a more responsiblo but worse paid position than the latter for the greater part of his service? By this rule the later a man's merits place him in the rank of a cergeant the greater is the amount of good conduct pay he will receive. g-2. If a sergeant is tried by a court-martial and reduced to the ranks he becomes entitled to good conduct pay directly he becomes a private, according to his total length of service (less Id. forfeited for the actual offence for which tried); and now, if subsequently promoted, vwill be allowed to retain the good conduct pay thus obtained, although the sergeant of perhaps 20 sears' standing, because he was deserving of early advancement, and has never been reduced, does not get afarthing; sure)y this is " injustio" 3. A soldiet promoted a sergeant before be has served five years has no chance of ever obtaiaing good conduct pay, wbatever his merit or length of seivice, exceot under the ridiculous circumstances shown above in No.2. I could adduce many other cases, but will not venture to trespas furtber on your valuable space. Fither the regulatiotL shovld never hate been altered, or ihe Good Conduct Warrantahould have been thrown opento all ran}s; as it now atande,jnstioe is not done to any. By giving insertion tathe above you will confer a favour on a "veiy latge cl~e. of Her Majeity's most faithful servants, the serges~te of ts Britishl army. _I aD,_Sir, y*C,njoat ebedlient. hulmble ser-vant.

ilEB STrATSZBRYICE. TO TH EDITO F OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having this day ben obliged by colege disciphie to endure the tedium of a prolonged S ce,-in wrhisk it imposible to join,-I venture to address a few words to, The Times to beg you to make everyeffort to stay the se of the State Services at present precribed for us by the Prayer-book. Who, I ask, can honesty say that his heart is brimful of thmnkfnlnews for the recall of Charles and James IL, and does not feel very like a hypocrite in praiing God (with all the bombast and "'vain repetitions" with which the servica abounds), for disppoinLing the wicked designs of traitorous, beady, and high.minded men, and preventing the destraction of this church arid nation by the timely restoration of the Stuat Kings, when we know what that "father of bis people," Chrles IL, and his royal brother and umccessor did for-or ratber against, religion and morality ? Forsooth, we shall bo told that, at this distnce of time, we may well lose sight of tbe rgly facts of these monrchbe abandoned profligacy and licentiousness,-that they trafflcked i, creeds for money, broke .aith with the earnest ftbough fnatical) Paritans, brought virtue into contempt by their open debaucheries, and placed British creditat a disconut by their wholesale squtadering of public money, while our gratitude is still freeh at the thought that ing Charles IL was, in 1660, "restored to us and to his own just and uandoubted rights"-"theright ma putinthe rightplae." Of a truth we have, in the words of the Service for that day, "a new song put into our mouthb," when, on the5th of November, we thanklully commemorate the arrival of King William to deliver this church and nation from those very men who themselves came to deliver them. Now, undoubtedly, the Restoration was agreatblessing in 160, and men had reason to thank God that they were 3ID longer under Croniwell; hbut we must, I think, have strong imaginations to "coach-up" these sentiments on each recurring 29th of May; or, if as Englishmen we properly value these mercies, I doubt whether we prove much gatitude to the Giver by the cola-hearted repetition, year after year, of Services which would seem by their style and matter to have been dictatedrather by bigotry or excitement than by Christian charity and forbearance. Apolo'izing for my intrusion, and begging you,. should you see ntting, to give this a place in your columns, I beg to subscribe myself, Sir, your obedient servant. OXONIENSIS. .ay =.
THE NEW COURT Of PROBATE. TO TEB EDITOE OF TIHE TIMES. Sir,-Tho arguments of your correspondent "Veritas' agaist giVig estamentary jurisdiction to the CountyCourta where the ehects are under 200W. are in themselves sound. and unanswerable, aud would be very valuable were it a fact that the Lord Chancellor's Bill contemplates giving to those courts the juridiction to which " Veritas' refers; but it is not so. The Bill only gives jurisdiction to those oourts in contentious cases under 2001.-not in those of commton form-and even in them a resort to the County Courts is not compulsory; and when the contention has been determined the grants are to issue from the district registyies, and the origmal documents will be deposited there. The contentious cases of all values do not exceed 1 in 100, and probably the County Courts would be rezv rarely resorteiL to; but it is in accordance with the legislation of theday to give parties the opportunity of resorting to lcal jurisdictions if they so desire. Again, all the recent Bills on this subject, exoept the present, have expre.sly provided that a schedule smeeifying the property of the deceased should be annexed to the affidavit, as your correspondent suggests, and I have no doubt that it is intended that this should be the practice under the new court to be established by the present Bill. It is simply a question of pratice, and the Bill contains a clause giving to the judge full powers to make rules and orders regulating all such matters. On the question of fees I have no doubt that the Lord Chancellor is right. The whole character of the country jurisdiction will be so much altered that no reference, however careful, to the existing returns would enable the Legislature to fosm even an approximate estimate of the business which would be transacted at each registry, and it seems to me to be wise to adopt- a system of fees until some experience bas been obtained as to such business, and then to resort to salaries proportioned to the labour and respoiasibihty in each case. If " Veritaa" will study the Bill with the care of whichv his mind is evidently capable, he will, I think, agree with me that it is the rmost practical and in other respects the best Bill whmich-bas been introduced upon the subiect. A i.VUUNiKY ~3SULICTOR.
TzitEEn=qC o rliEts AT ELECTIONS.-An importsmt petition is to be presented to the House of Commons from certain electors of West;Norfolk, praying for an inquiry into alleged interference in the late election for the division by the Earl of Leicester, lord-lieutenant of the county.

FOB}IGN INTELLIGATCE. FRANOE. [A portn of the folowing appexed In our ond ,w1 %,t? S5:117 -1 We have recoeived the following telegraphio dospatch from our Paris correspondent:- "PARIS, SATURDAY, MAY 30, 8 A.M. The 21onitcur announces the dimsolution of the Legislative Body. The new elections are to commence on the 21st of June, and will last two days. The number of the Deputies forthe now7 Chamber is fixed at 267." (PBOM OUR OWN OORRZ,8PONDZNT.) PARIS, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 6 P.m. The Persian Ambassador, Feruk Khan? recoived yesterday the official news of the ratification at Teheran of the treaty with England. He at the same time received a letter from bin Governmeont expressing much satisfaction at the success of the negotiation, and flattering acknowledgmenta of the ability and zeal he had diaplayed. The Ambasador bas returned to Paris from hbs visit to different vw;nufacturing towns in tho north of F0ranco. Aftie; being at Roubaix and Tourooing, he visited all the principal manufactulring establishments of Lille. IlL Kuhimann, the Prtident of the Chamber of Commerce, gave a dinner in honour of tlhe Envoy, to which v;ere invited a number of tho adinlulatra' tive and commercial notabilities of the plaoe. To a toast to the Shah of Persia, given by MI. Kitldllaninu, Femrk Kban replied in Perfian, whioh was interpreted by M. Riberstein. Tho Ambawador, ili turn, proposed the health of the hEmperor aud of the Imperial family, and the prospority of Franoe, aLd spoke in tbe most grateful terms of tle kiu.l recption he had met with since his arrival in France. A tefegraphic despatch from Madrid announlcedl yesterday that new difliculties had arisen in the negotiations on the Mexican (luestion, and privato letters from that city of the 26th contiritm the fact. Theo "MIlexican question" conprised the elsimB of certain bondholders iu tho Republic, whioh are od old standing, and the satisfaotion dvemaundx tby Spain for the outrages and mumrers pexretratesl oi Spanish subjects resident inl the bxoxwau ter- ritory.

It is to be regretted that YI. Lafrmaua did not arrive sn adrid some tine before the meeting of the Cortes. The Gxovernment feelu that the Deputies, although for the graater part its own nominees, arm growing unmanageable now that they are elected, and with ungrateful hardihood presume to make a -how of independence. There is now an ontcry against Mexico, which people pesuade themselves and othez, is patriotic_that unhappy adjective which is go dr-eadfally prtituted in Spain. On the whole, I fear that Lord Howden and M. de Turgot may be working, not for Qu-eea Iahelli, bnt, az they say in Franoe, "pe pr le Roi de Pr'i-m'-that is, for nothing. The Minister of War han received, vid Marseilles, the following telegraphic despatch from the Governor-General of Algeria:- "< ALGIE,R8, MA,Y 26. "We had a brilliant affair against the Bseal-Raten on th9 24th. All their pozitiona were carried. I send my report by the mall." The Paris papers have been recommended by the authorities not to make any allusion to the visit paid yesterday morning by the Emperor and King of Bavaria to the MaReum of Artillery. This, of course, has excited a good deal of curiosity, and people are tring to account for such precaution. Some suspect that an unpleasant incident, a political manifestation for instance, took place in the establishment. The trath of the matter seems to be that the Grand Duke Constantine was not taken to the Mus6e while he was inspecting the curiosities of Paris, as experiments are made in the Museum wJith the inventions of the Emperor, which could not well be shown to a visitor who was, when too late, found to be over-inquisitive in his researchles, and too accurate in noting them down. The experiments were kept from the knowledge of the Russian " Paul Pry," but there could not be much barm in Bhowing them to a pacific Prince like the King of Bavaria. It was thought as well, however, not to let the Grand Duke know that there were things which he did not see, and therefore the journals were requested to say nothing about the visit-a request which will, of course, be complied with, and the Grand Duke wil remain ignorant of the preference given to King .Iaximilian. The Moniteur wiJl soon publish decrees nominating a small batch of new Senators; their names have been already given. It is pretty certain that the Government had decided on getting rid of at least SO members of the present, or rather late, Chamber (it expired yesterday, and until its death was announced few knew that it was living). This measure was rendered necessary by the utter uselessness of the parties, the aversion felt for them in their departments, and the unwillingness of the Government to injure itself by again cramming them down the throats of the unfortunate electors. They were men utterly unknown and as little respected by their constituents-men without political or social standing, who would serve any master for place, dc., and whose single merit was to be the servants of any master for the time being. They possessed no inteligence or capacity as a set-off, and did more injury than service to the Government. By dint of supplications the num'oer of the rejected is reduced from 50 to about 20, and for aught I know t.his nAumber may be still more reduced. The following private telegraphic despatch has beea received: "VIENNA, MAY 29. "The general meeting of the shareholdes of the Austrian RailwayP Company, after having heard a report on the progress of the construction of the lines and the working, uanimously voted a dividend for 1856 of 21f. 58fc. per eare, in addition to the interest of five per cent.

Their object was the establishment of a democratic and weial republic, and their passwords were "Courage," "Vengeance," AlibanLd," " Pianorn," " Miano." Of the 45 arrested si- were acquitted. Ravet DesmouoliN, Auaigne, FmranoiB, and Joseph, proved to have been the chiefs of the secref society, were sentenced to periods of imprisonment varying from four years to 18 months, and to pay fines varying from 5OOf. to 200f. The remainder were sentenced to impronment for periods vazying from two years to six months, and to fies varying from 300f. to 100f. it is not generally known that all members of a secret society are subject, by an Imperial decree, to be transported to a penalcolony after the expiration of the sentence of the Cout. The Tnbunal of Correctional Police yesterday tried a banker named Malvergne, a bookbinder named Bacharach, and a man of no regular occmpation named Terrier de Montal, now in the Debtors' Prison in the Rue de Clichy, for swindling in connexion with an enterprise called the Baleine Fran9aise, the ostensible object of which was to make a substitute for whalebone out of the horns of oxen. The case has been before the Courts in other shapes. In 1854 a company for making French whalebone was formed with a capital of 800,000f., In shares of 200f., but it did not succeed, and in 1855 the accused, who were the most active parties in it, caUed what they pretended was a general meeting of the shareholders, but which was not so in reality, and made that meeting resolve that the capital should be raised to 1,200,000f., in 24,000 shares of 50f.; their object in so doing being to give the affair an importance which it did not possess, and so induce the public to subscribe for shares. They then puffed the concern in the most extravagant terms in prospectusesand newspapers, and had recourse to all the tricks and schemes practised by the lower orderof speculators to force up the value of shares. At length the affair was declared a complete failure, and the loss of course fell on the unfortunate shareholders; but the three men took care to put large sums into their own pockets, and, moreover, they charged the shareholders exorbitant sums for their services as managers of the company. The tribunal condemned Malvergne to six months' imprisonment and 1,000f. fine, Bacharach to three months' imprisonment and 300f. fine, and De Montal to one month's imprisonment and 300f. fine. In the course of the trial it was proved that Malvergne and Bacharach had illegally acted as agens(le change, and for that offence they were severally ordered to pay a twelfth of the caution-money of agens, which caution-money is 125,000f. A man named Diol6, who had been connected with the Baleine Francaise, was also tried for having participated in the latter offence, but was acquitted.

The incident arose from the warmth of political feeling excited by the debates in the Chamber of Representatives on " charitable institution5" and particularly by the aftttude of the Opposition i the sitting of Wednesday. Me Frbre, a member of the latter, laid the foundation of the subwequent dis- i order by characterizing the guarantee offered by Government for the production of the accounts of monasticinstitutions as an insultingfarce. Loud cries from the Right of "We know nothing of the kind" interrupted the speaker, who was requested by the President to retract bis words. M. Frrre replied in astentorian voice-" When, some days ago, I denounced the conduct observed towards some young girls, lace workers in a religious institution, a voice in this chamber taunted me as anu iifdme." This sentence was received with applause by the strangers in the gallery, who commenced yelling and stamp. ing. The President gave orders to the Huissiers to clear the gallery, and the public slowly withdrew. The allusion of M. Frere to the lace manufacturers is explained by the following article in the Psrcureur of Antwerp " The Oenvazeur published In one of its late nurbers a fact so incredible that in the expecttion of an official contradietiea we have until now hesitated to lay it before our readers. in eooxequence of the sience of the clerical journali and of the persons interested we sea no longer doubt the correctness of the aocount given by that journal. It ir, therefore, now certain that the religieuses of the lace schoot of Liederkerke caused the hair of the heads of 10 young-girli vho worked n their znanufactory to bo cut off because on the Sunday of Ikernaesun, these poor girls had taken part in a danco!e After a few minute3 had elapsed, and before the excitement rerated among the members of th3 Chamber by this incident had subsided, a great Saumber of men with their hats on forced their way into the galleries, and it was necessary to have racourse to the troops on guard to clear the Chamber! and orders were given to strengthen the military posts outside. -Half an hour after this second disturbanee the President resumed his eat, and the discussion reconmmenced. Meanwhile the public, after having been eoxeUed from the House, assembled in noisy and agitated groups in tho cpace which separate3 the Park from the Chamber. Above a thousand persons belonging to respectablo classes of society congregatei rontld tho steps of tho Chamber, and awaited the clono of the sitting. No sooner had the proceedings tenrmirateeL and somo menbmera of the Right doparte I than a istorm of hisse and yolls aroso from the crowd. The Apostolic Nuncio, Monsignor Gonella, wh) wss leaving at tho oamo time, musconstrued tho attitudo of the crowd into a pertonal attack upon himself, aad withdrow into tho Chambor. But the Minister of Foreign Affairs and M. Domoor, a Liberal mnembor hastened to acquaint him with his orror, and, offAring him tbeir arms they left the Chmnbevr and accompanied the prelato to his carringe. a he groups mnade way with respect for the Nunelo, and maany porsonistook off tlhoir hats to the representativo of tho Church. It appoared that the crowd had, in tho first Instanco, mistakon tho lattor for tho " Chanoiuo do Haere," a moat unpopular person, a faet which explained tho hostile manife3tatIon. The meubors of tho Loft wero roceived by the crowd with onthusiastio cheers. M. Rogier, oa appearing on tlhe stepsi was thoobjoct of a particular ovation, but he retroated before the welcomo which awaited him, and lef t tho Chambor by a privato gato. Tho crowd, after waiting in vain for M. Frreo, procoeded to hio residonce where it sang the " BrabanQomie" under his windows, and indulged in innumerable " vivats." The crowd next proceeded to tho residenceo of M. Verhaeen, and favoured hitm with a similar manifestaion; it tihe dispersed in the utmost order. During tho abovo scenes the troops were ordlered to remain in barracks, ready to act should circumstances unfortunately demand their interforenco, At the commoncoment of Thursday's sitting of tho hahmber Vicomte Vilain XIV., Ministor of Foreign Affairs, rose, and thus alluded to tho evonta of the preceding day:- " Gentleoenr,-A oroumatanco to be regretted occurred yesterday. The Apoztolio Nuncio to the Court of Brassel, was sriously insnlted This Inoident took place yestorday At 5 o'olook. and at half-past 5 the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in uniforul, prooooded to tho residence of his Excellnuoy and oflford excuses to him in the name of hi' Government, which the Nuncio would have been justifie I in demanding hal he had time to draw up his represnta. tions. From the residenoe of the Nunolo I proceedod to the Chateau do L%ecken, whereI rendered an account of my conduct to the King. The King approved it, and hai charged the Grand Maralal to express this morning to the Papal Nu\ncio tho regrets of His Majesty. I oonsider that the incident is terminated2" This brief speech was received bythe Chamber with general approbation. After the sitting, the Cabinet Ministers proceeded to Laecken, where a Council, presided over by the King, tool place. The Ministers remained to a grand dinner given at tho chAteau, where the Royal Family, the dignitaries of the Court, and several strangers of distinction were present. The Indgendanae Belge of Friday has the following - " The manifestations were renewed yesterday on a larga scale. Long before the sitting of the Chamber of Reprosentatives was over an immense mtltitude had assembled in the vicinity of the Palace, waiting for the deputies to come out. Cheers and hisses continued for nearly half aa hour. "The mob then procseded towards M. Frare's house That gentleman was absent. The crowd then made for the park, and as it passed under the Palace windows gave cheers for the King. " The numbers had now considerably increased, and th i crowd prceeeded across the Place Royale and the Rue de Is Regence. Before the Palace of Justice they stopped to hiss and express their dissatisfaction in various Ways Leaving the Rue de la Regence they entered the Rue des linimes, stopping before the houses of M. Verhaegen and Orts, to cheer those popular members; -1-ey then proceeded to the offices of the Bmandlpatioim and of the Journal de Bruxezes, where the mob took up a menacing attitude. " In the evening their Royal Highness0e the Duke and Duchess de Brabant attended the Opera. Their carriage wa greeted as it passed with cries of ' FVevle Zo il' 'Vire le Duc de BrabantP' They were also cheered on entering the theatre. The pit then loudly demanded the 'Brabanconne,' and the national air was performedby the orchestra, and followed by loud cheering. The opera was TFWiiam, Te, and the patriotic pasges were loudly cheered. Their Royal Highnesses did not leave till the performance wAs over. " The crowd outdde the theatre is estimated to have been about 5,000. This body split into two parties. One took the direction of the Grande Place, singing the 'Braban,onne' in chorus, the other proceeded to the Emancipatio office. They broke it open, smashed the windows, and destroyed a portion of the type. The other party halted in the Grande Place, where the national air was sung in loud chorus. Most of the shops were shut. Smaller bands traversed the city during the night. " At the moment we are going to press order appears to be restored." The Obsenateur says :' The troops of the garrison have been ordered to remain within their barracks. Alarming reports are circulating. " 6 p.m.-There is a large crowd assembled round the Palace. Cries of I rvc le Boi' are intermingled with shouts cf 'A bas les Couvents I"' The Bnmancipation says " Among the shouts of the mob we distinguished those o' 'Down with the priests!' 'Down with the CatholicsI ' Let us drown tho Pre^ident ! ' " The mob has broken the windows of the Jesuit College and of the Capucin lMnaatery." A despatch dated Brusse, Friday, says " The Civic Guard is called out. Squadrons of laners, Cuirassiers, and other troops have arrived at Brussels. A Cabinet Council is itting. It is thought that the obuoxiou Bill will be withdrawn." The Conttiltdionnel publishes the following letter from Brussels, dated Friday evening:- " Yesterday a battalion of Chasseurs Carabineers arived here from Molines, aud tha Cuirassiers of the garrison o Ghent. A detachment of Gendarmerie was drawn up on the Boulevard close to the Porte d la ILoL, outside of which I hi. Frare's residence. Before the sitting oommenced a de. tachment of the 11th Regiment of theLine was stationed in the back court of the House of Asembly. In the square in front of the palace someo companies of Carabineers were stationed. Inside the building, in the grand Hall, on the stairs and in the galleries, a number of soldiers were on duty. The sitting passed over quietly. Many ladies were present. A proclamation had been issued in the morning, an I placarded on the walls by order of the Mayor, forbidding assemblages in the streets of more than five persons. When te deputies left the House, the mob, being called upon to disperse, hissed the soldiers. Various false reports were circulated through the town, It was said the Blshao'd Pnlaco at Ghent had been bumt down, and that the students of the Universities of that town and of Liege were marching on Brmsels. These reports were false. When the poatleft there was stiU considerable excitement in the town," AUSTRIA (JRo O ~ OWN V IE N NA , L 27. The Wiener Zei*ung of this mnornig containa the following autograph letter from His Majesty the Emperor to the Govemnor-General of Hunar "Dear Cousin Archduke Albrecht,-.As a supplement to my decree of the 12th July, 155;6, by which property tba had been confiscated as a consequence of the sentence of a imilitary court was retumed to several persons who were concerned in the rebellion in the kingdom of Hungary and in the Grand Principality of Transylvania in 1848 and 1841J, I now ordain,-- "1.

"At the samo time my Ministers of the Interior, Finance, and Justlco arm instracted to do what is necessary to giv fhull eflfet to this my decree. " Buda, May 23, 1857. " FRANCIS JOSEPH." The foregoing ordinance will be a real godsend to many most respectable families, who during eight long years have been exposed to great privations; and its second article will restore peace of mind to many persons who owed the State certain sums of money that had been advanced them, but which they, during the troubles of 1848 and 1849, applied to purposes that were by no meals conducive to its interests. The fourth article will not fail to cause many a sleepless night to some of those Austrians who have relatives living as fugitives in foreign countries. As bas already been said, the great majority of the refugees will be permitted to return to their homes, and will have their property restored to them, but there are some few persons whose misdeeds will never be eitherforgotten or forgiven. The names of the persons who cannot hope for mercy are well known to me, but for self-evident rea30ns they cannot be publicly mentioned. The Austrian writers, who in general are niuch inclined to abuse hyperbole when speaking of the Emperor, are but lukewarm in their praise of his magnanimity and clemency. It has so often been my lot to censure the measures of the Austrian Government, that it affords me exctreme pleasure to be able publicly to espress admiration of the generous conduct of His Majesty towards his subject.. At 10 o'clock in the morning of the 20th their MIa3etstes quitted S3zegedin, and travelled by way of Vasarhely, Oroshaza, Pusz;ta Gerendas, and Eigyos to Gyusla, where they psassed the night. At Eigyos the Imperial travellers wrere received by a deputation on horseback, which had been sent by the important town and fortress of Arad. Shortly before dinner the authorities of Gyula waited on the Emperor, and in the evening there was the usual official illumination. In the morning of the 2th, after having visited the public offices and prisons at Gyula, His Majesty left for Gro3svardein, which is considered the most truly Magyar city in Hungary. Directly after their arrival, at 2 o'clock, their Majesties heard Te Deu6m sung, and on leavnug the Cathedral thev received the congratulations of the authorities an'd noblie. The q esth and Vienna papers already yon lain detailed accounts of the journey to and arrnval at Jaaz-Bereny. The inhabitants of the placo in question, which is the captal of Jazygien and Great and Little Cumanien, were in a state of great excitement fully 48 hours before the arrival of their Majesties, and in the morning of the 23d the mennyecss7ek (young women) and leg6nyek (youn,g men) ad some little difficulty in keeping their ninpatience and curiosity within due bounds. Trtee hundred peasants followed the Imperial carriage, which was besides escorted by 14 noble landed pro-.| prietors, dressed in blue cloth embroidered with silver, and wearing black feathers in their kalpags (national caps). As a matter of course, the Emperor was addressed in tHne Hungarian languae on his arrival at Jas7.-Bereny, and on his rdplying in the same language the delight of the Hungariansowas exeessive. The women presented bread and e akes, and the men cheese and a black lamb (the latter as a token of homage). A depuaci- etin of ladies then advanced, and put into the handsL of the mpress a veil embroidered with gold and a Hungarian cap (harta), with a crown of pearls on the top of it. The gentlemen displayed their gallantry by presenting to Her Majesty a medal and an album, which contained six very pretty paintings of scenes taken from life in the prtas (, garian plains). On the 24th there was a popular festival, during which gulyes a national dish, made of stewed beef with plenty of red pepper-and wine were distributed gratis. There were several Gipsy bands, and tbe C hsardas (a national dance) was danced with a vigour which seemed to astonish their Majesties and theair suite. As usual, the male Jazygier wore over their ehoulders pelisses ornamented with the fur of the fox, which are the property of their mothers, wives, or sisters The "Great Cumaniter," almost all of whom are Calvinist3 were dressed something like Edgardo in Lutio d; i;amme7rmo. Their costume is entirely black, with feathers of the same colour in their caps. The colour of the dress of the "Little Camanier" is dark blue, with silver embroidery. According to telegraphic despatehes of the 20th and 26th, the Archduchess Sophia Frederica is making progress towards recovery.

(FROM 0173 BERLIN QosRzsPoISDZNL) BERLIN, MiAy 28. In the early part of this month the new "clerical" mission appointed to relieve their countrymen who have completed their period of 10 yersr set off for Pekin. On this occasion the mission consists of the rchimandrite irei, who has already passed a period of 10 years there, three priests, four students, a surgeon, and an artist; but thisctime the duration of the mission is to be restricted to six years, inasmuch as it has been found that the influences of the climate and of the Arinterrupted devotion to thre duties of the sisiionwin a fer years- act- very-injuriously on the health. Thisclerical missionu it will be recollecteds dates from a period towards the close othehe 17th century, when the Chinese had succeeded in expelling the Russians from the region of the Anoor, which the latter then possessed, and which they have lately regained. On occasion of one of these military incursiona of the Chinese they succeeded in taking several Russians prisoners, whom they carried to Pekin, and here the said prisoners, who are stated to have been Coaacks, were, on account of their bravery, appointed to the Body Guard of the Bogdy-Chan. Ostensibly on account of these menthe Russian Government obtained permission to erect a place of worship in Pekin; this one place of worship has now expanded into two churches; their public worship celebrated there is perfectly tolerated by the Chinese, and the Russians in China have altogether less to suffer from the persecution than other Christians are exposed to, as it is said on account of their not atempting to make proselytes. The spot where the little body of Russians lives in Pekin is favoured by having a guard of honour appointed to it; that this guard of honour has, however, other objects than merely testifying respect need not be doubted. According to the latest advices received in St. Petersburg from Pekin, umder date of January 5, the Russian clerical mnision there was making its preparations to leave, as soon as the members of the new mision should arrive to relieve it. Lettrs from Kiachta of March 20th mentioned that the two Asnericans, Mess. Collins and Payton, -who had pased up the Amoor for the purpose of openmng commercial relations with those regions, had been made the subject of various ovations. At a banquet given in their honour they had dilated much on the friendship existing between the United States and Russia, which had shown itself in such bright colours during the late war and toasted General Mouraviefi; who had done more than any of his predecessorasforEasternSiberia During their stay they were present at the Feast of Lances in Maimatschin, and they subsequently returnedhomebydropping down the Aznoor. Trade in KRiachta was described as very brisk, particularly iD. tea ; there had been, as these letters report, Russian goods for fully half a million roubles silver exported to China this season; but, as other letters speak also of gold and silver specie having been exported to China from Russia to exactly that amount, and about the same time, it is very probable that this latter version is the correct statement. At Irkutsk they 'had been expecting arrivals of American sugar, wbich was to be conveyed up the Amoor, but the badness of the intervening land communication had prevented the execution of this plan. The fair at Irbit, on the other side of the Ural Mouutains, was brought to a close on March 13, after having lasted four weeks; the value of the goods brought thither for sale was estimated at 40 million silver roubles, the greater part of which consisted of tea from China. The prices of tea were lower than usual, but the quality was proportionably worse. Of all other goods the prices were about 15 per cent. higher; sugar cost 16 roubles per poud-that is to say, about is. 3d. per lb. As a proof of the march of civilization evenacross the Ural mountains, itmay be mentioned thatthis fair was attended by a considerable number of sharpers of both sexes, whose gains seem to have been all the greater as the total inexperience of the persons theypractised on offered a virgin soil for their ingenuity to cultivate. A modern Crcesus has just died in Ural possessed of a fortune estimated variously at 10,000,000 and 20,000,000 roubles; in spite of all this wealth he could not bring himself to leave the spot where he had made all his money and where he still persevered in amassing. He had of late been proseCUtillg alawsuit, upon the resultof which several millions depended; it was decided in his favour on the 14th of March oi this year 2andonthefollowing day Death came end carried him offr frozn the scene of his labours and, his immense opulence. Some very flaming paragraphs in the Rusian pTesinformus that enterprise and the spirit of amsociation inRussia are now so rife that theGovern. ment Board, which haa to examine into the different scbemes is overburdened with business. Five different lines of railway are spoken of as projected, in addition to the grand railway network scheme; Odessa-Kieff, OdesKischeneff, Kieff-Brody, from Ribinaik (the centre of the inland water navigation) to the Moscow-St. Petersburg Railway, so as wo connect the Wolga Fith both the Baltic and the Black Seas; and, fifthly, a line from Saratov to meet the Moscow-St. Petersburg line. The three first of these are, however, one and the same undertaking which I endeavoured to describe to you lately as abot to be carriedoutin part bya loan raised onthe "souls" possessed by the landed proprietors of those regions. The entire capital required is 120,000,000 silver roubles, of which 80,000,000 were to be raised by shares and 40,000,000 to be advanced by the Government Bank on the security of the rerfs. One feature about the figures put forward by this company isdeserving of attention. In the estimates published by this company of nativestheexpenses of construction are taken at 80,000 silver roubles per verat; in the etimates of the grand railway network scheme the ines which are intended to traverse the same and similar country, e. g., from Moscow to Theodosia, ditto to Nischni-Novgorod, and from Kursk to Libau, those expenses are takien at 62,000 silver roubles; so that we have thealternative of concluding eitherthat the French engineers have grievouslyu derratedi the expenses of const;ruction, or that the Russian landholders in those parts contemplate getting aome pretty pickings out of the speculation over and above thelegitimate advantages to be derived from the railway. Thereha also been a new company formed, principally by Frenchmen, the domicil of which wil be in Taganrog, for preserving and exporting the beef which at present is thrown away as worthless in the steppes. Thousands of oxen are kiled there every year for the sake of the hides and tallow; and it is now proposed to preserve the flesh by parboiling it and packing it in herrmeticaUy closed tins. Some Russian capitalists also have applied to the Government for permission to get up a o3mpany on which the Government shall confer the exclusive right of manufacturing phosphorus matches for aU the Russias. A company has been formed and received the Government concession for aline of railwayin Finland - it is to run from St. Petersburg to Tawastehus, and eubsequently to Abe. Advices from Rusia state positively that all the necessary preparations have made by the Government for the commencement of the St. Petersburg-Warsaw line with its branch to the Prussian frontier. The works are represented as having already begun at St. Petersburg, Diinaburg, Wilna, and Kowno, and the Government has put 6,000 soldiers at the service of the directing engineer for the constraction of the earthworks. The Warsaw-Vienna Railway is said to be leased by a Silesian company, in coDjunction with a Warsaw banker named Eppstein, and a merchant named Mildo; they are to lay out 200,000 silver roubles yearly and build the branch lines that are required. The Government guarantees them 5 per cent. and a third of the surplus over and above that percentage. The shares of the Russo-American Company continue to fall very considerably, although the developementof trade and commerce in the Pacific would naturaly lead to the expectation of high dividends and increased prosperity; it is surmised that there is some intention on the part of the Government to put an end to the company's monopoly. arrival at Odes3s of the steamers Juno, Pallas, Ceres, Nficolajew, and Don, which were built in England for the Russian Commercial and Navigation Company, has been telegraphed to St. Petersburg. ITALY. (PRo0 OUB. OWN COxRnSPOZDnx.) TURIN, MAY 25. This morning, at 10 o'clock, the Empress Dowager of Russia left Turin by railway to Susa, en route for Geneva and Germany. Her departure was attended with the same ceremonies as her arrival,-that is to say, there were guards of honour, the streets lined with soldiers, the military bands playing Rhe Russian Hymn in the most doleful manier imaginable, and a large concourse of independent publc. King Victor Emmanuel, the Princess Clotilde, and the Prince Carignano accompanied the Empress as far as Susa, and having seen her! to her carriage there they returned to town iimmediately. Yesterday the King of Saxony and his daughter the Duchess of Genoa arrived at the Royal Palace. Their entrance toTurinwasunattendedwithanykind of state, but a very large crowd bad collectedin the square at the railway atation on seeing some of the Court carriages waiting there, and the Duchess *as welcomed by the people with an unaffected cheerfu'ness that showed they were really glad to kee her again. Last night the Court went to the Royal Theatre, where a concert was given (this not being the opera season), and the house was lighted A giomno. The house was of course crammed,to excess in every part, und, as every one possessed of diamonds took occasion to display them, and thbose entitled to wear uniform were forced to do to, whether they liked it ornot, the cetip d(i was very imposing. As the Court party entered the State box every one rose, and there was a general clapping of hands, which lasted several minutes, the orchestra playing the Russian Hymn. The Empress was then seated in the centre of the box, with the King of Saxony and the Duchess of Genoa on her right, and King victor Emmanuel, the Princess Clotilde, and Prince Carignano on her left. At the conclusion of the concert the Royal party received the same applause as on entering. The residence of the Empress Dowager at Nice and her present journev through this country have afforded the Russian Government an opportunity for scattering some of those stars and crosses that have always constituted an important part of its foreign policy. Almost every one with whom the Empress came in contact in the most casual way, from the Princess Clotilde down to the Lieutenant of Marines of the Governolo, has received a decoration of some sort or other. One remaTkable exception, however, has been made in favour of M. Rattazzi, the Minister of the Interior, which has given much offence to some and made others among the decorated feel extremely awkward. It is almost impossible to suppose that this solitary exclusion from the intenided honours was the efect of inadvertence-the thing was too marked to admit of such an excuse-but with whtom the fault rest I cannot pretend to may. Rulo;ascribes it to Count Stackelberg, the Rusian 1inisttr here, and adds that he ws persuaded thereto by some Piedmontese friends, who regard the v6ulltion between Count Cavour and Is. RattJA WM displeaure, on account of the plebeian birth of the latter; but, whoever may. be to blme, it ins caly * blunder quite unworthy' of the traditionalict if lRursian diplomacy to wound the sensibility of the middle ClRasse of this country by showing a desire to Islight their chief representative in the Cabinet at the'very moment when it in doing its utnOpt to cxploiier constitutional apirations in Italy for its own anti-AuStran purposes. The Rus Government will have no reason to roward Its a&' kward agent, whoever he is, who has so inopportunely betrayed the true feelings of the St. Petersburg Cabinet with regard to popular institutions, and if there is any truth in t report that it was done at the in8tigation ofthe enemie of M. CRattazzi, it is a sil greater mistake, for, instead of annoyinir M. Itattazzi, or weakening his infiencein the Cabinet,itwill havetbe effect of increasing his popularity out of doors, and thereby rendering him more necesary to the Government, and at the same time of making his noble colleagues verymuch ashamed of their Russian decorations. But perhaps the most stupid part of the transaction is confounding the individual with the place he ho.ds, for, it is evident that the discourtesy is offered toKiopg Victor Emmanuel'r Secretary of State for the Inte rior,and only affects the Advocate Rattazzi inas. much as he happens to fill that office at the prest moment. For the rest, Her Imperial Majesty was most liberal in her largesses, and distributed her privata charity with no sparing hand in every town on her route. The Ring of Saxony and the Duchess of Genos left Turin again to-day. The news from the provinces is again favourable~ for harveBtprospects, with the exceptionof the'silk; crop, on which head the accounts are again contiadictory ; but for gmain and, green crops not;hing could be more satisfactory, and in the Igura it is said- that the symptoms of oidiunm have ceased, for the moment at least, and that both vines and olives were looking well. Mamy parcels of wormx bred from Brianza and other Lombard seed had failed a few days after the opening, for which reason many contractsare now made for hatched seed in the second stage, in order toconsume the leaves In the neighbourhood of Turin the leaves are better than elsewhere in Piedmont; in fact, farmers from Pinerolo and Asti and other districts come hither to purchase leaves. This is accounted for by the great difference of temperature that has prevailed in various parts of the tountry during the last week ; but it is not thought likely that this difference in advancement will have much influence on the general harvest. On the whole the worms are reported to be doing well. The seeds from other countries which have succeeded best in Piedmont have been from Ferrar and the Romagna. The Tuscan seed has also answered welL The French seed has proved the worst. The contracts for cocoon5 of the first quality are quoted at the almost incredible price of 1Q00. per miria, and the medium qualities at from 80f. to 85f. From alI that can be ascertained at present onthe subject there is every reason to hope that the coming harvest will be better than the last. The weather has changed within the last few days frora dry sudtry heat to mild warm rain, which so far is good for all aorta of agriculture. The only fear is that there may be too much of it. According to a despatch received by the Anmo. nia from Ancona, the Pope arrived in that town on the 22d. His Holiness is now probably at Sinigaglia, his native place, where he will remain some days, and, as at present arranged, will not reach Bologna before the 5th or 6th of June. During his journey the Pope appears to have confined himself strictly to the religious objects for which he travels. He has visited Loretto and other holy shrines; he has said masses, and worshipped relies wherever there was anything remarkable on his route, and he has bestowed charity and benedictions with great liberality wherever he has gone; but as yet he does not seem to have interested himself in the temporal welfare of those parts of his dominions through which he has passed. Perhaps, however, the Holy Father is " takin' notes," and, if so, it wllR be of immense service for the world at large if he will some day " prent 'em" for the edification of the faithfuL A letter from Rome of the 21st instant mentions that military manceuvres bad been performed the previous day at the camp called Dells Farneuina. These manceuvres were intended to exercise the Papal artillery under the direction and with the assistance of General Goyon, Commander-in. Chief of theFrench troops. Many foreign journals have praised the efficiency of the Papal troops, but on the late occasion the manceuvres could not have been performed had not the Fxench artillery kindly lent two six-pounders with their accessories, and still the Papal troops on the ground is pompously styled the First Regiment of Pontifical Artillery. After the manceuvres the French took possession of their guns and brought them to the Castle of St. Angelo, where they keep garrison. It was remarked that General Philip Farina, the Papal Miniter of War, was not present at the military ceremony. There was a brilliant sight at the Amphitheatre Flavio on the 16th. The amphitheatre was lighted with Bengal lights, and the effect was magnificent. It was believed that this sight was got up by the Government in compliment to tbq Empress Dowager of Russia, but such was§ not the fact. The expense wias defrayed by Count KRisseleff, the Russin Ambassador at the Court of Rome. The Empress Dowager of Russia arrived at Lans. le-Bourg on the afternoon of the 25th, and left the folowing morning for Chambery. The King of Saxony left Turin on the 25th for Stresa, on the tago Maggiore. The congress for t.he arrangement of the electric telegraph concluded its Iabours at Turin on the 25th, The representatives of the foreign telegraphic administrations who formed part of the Congress quitted Turin the same day. SPAIN. (rmox oUR ow. con=SoPDIMnrc.) MADRID, Y 25. General Concha's open opposition to Government renders his brother's removal from the command of Cuba even more certain than it was before. I have grounds for believing that this lucrative viceroyaltv, the great point of ambition of every Spanish general, 4 andthe nomination to whichis equivalent (besides the honour and glory of the post) to the grant of a large fortune, was recently offered to General Ros de Olano, who, however, felt himself compelled to decline it, on account of the implied condition of supporting the Government. It is~said to have been thrice offered to bim, until at last he declared that he should consider the application an insult if renewed. He informed Concha of what had psawed, and the knowledge that his brother was as gocd as dismissed perhaps contributed somewhat to the decided opposition the MIarquis de Duero last week showed to the Government in the Senate. It is thought here that the scandalous manner in which the slave trade has lately been carried on at Cuba. withtheconnivance and tothe profitof Jose Concha, and the representations of England on the subjects have also in some degree movedthe Spanish Government to change the C/aptrain-General. lt is probable that General Lersundi wrill succeed hims, in which cae I suppose Senor Gonzales Bravo will take the Ministry of Marine, as Narvaez is desirous of having him in the Government. It is not to be expected, however, that because a new Cap. tan-General is sent out the traffic in slaves will diminish. It may do so for a short timne, jubt for appearance sake, and until the papers have trumpeted forth the vigilance and probity of the new man; but, after that, as he has only three years to serve there, and considers: it a duty to himself and his.family not to return home Without a large fortune, we may be quite sure that be will tread in the steps of his predecessor. The English Government may make representations, Lord Howden may multiply his notes and obtain fair promises from Pidal, but these are not worth the foolscap on which they are written, so far as putting a check to the evil goes. If it is really desired to atop the slave trde, now so active in Cuba, let a sufficient force of gunboats, bei snt out to stand sentry over the Cubaa porbt, and -k-eep a bright look-out about the nooks and- creks in which slavers would be likely to run what portion of their wretkhed cargo the horrors of the 3niddle passage may leave alive.

There were from 1,500 to 2,000 persons present, and the respective candidates, Mr. Mills and Mr. For4ter, srpoke at some len4th in explanation of their politlcal sentiments, after which the chairman (Mr. Robert arr, a Conservative) took a show of hands, and declared it to be in favour of Mr. Mills. The majority was decided, but not very large, being about three-fifths to two-fifths. Some dissatisfaction was expressed by the friends of Mr. Forster at the manner ia which the meeting had been conducted, and when the decision was announced there were nerl cries that Mr. MillM rhould not be carried at the pot.

AAt SEPORT. COURT OF CFTAN".PV T.-- t!.AQVT.T - -.--t (Before the LORD CHANCELLOR and the, LORDS JDVSTIOW of ArPEAL ) This was an appeal from an order of the Master of the Rolls mado as far back as the year 1852, and related to the conbtrmction of the will of Mr. Castle, formerly proprietor of the George Hotel, Liverpool. The testator thereby left the business of the hotel to his widow for the maintenance of their children, and the surplus profits for her own benefit. In the event, however, of her giving up the hotel the business was to be carried on for the enaefit of the children. It appeared that Mrs. Castle left the hotel and her children under not very creditable ciroumstances, and the trustees of the will had carried on the business until the pressat time. The accumulated vrofits amounted to a sum of 2.8001., and the question raised by the appeal was who were entitled to them. When the case was before the Master of the Rolls he held that under the circumstances which had happened the widow and the two children were entitled to the testator's property as tenants in common, and she conrequently received one-third of the profits of the buasiness. From this decision Mrs. Castle now appealed. The ground why th^ appeal had been delayed so long was to allow the surplus profits to accumulate to a competent sum. MIr. Cairns and Mr. Giffard appeared for the appellant. Mr. R. Palmer and MIr. Eddis supported the order of the Court below. The LoRD CHA!CELLOR delivered the judgment of the Court, and said that he was of opinion the Master of the Rolls had given the widow more than she was entitled to. The fair intention of the testator, to be gleaned from his will, appeared to be that his widow should carry on the business of the hotel forthe benefit of the family, and, in tbe event of her ceasing so to do, some otber person was to carry it on, so long as it turned out beneficial to the estate. In the event of Mrs. Castle being unable or unwilling to continue to educate and maintain the children the trusts in her favour were to cease, and in lieu thereof she was to have a maintenance provided. That Mrs. Castle had by her conduct put herself out of the trusts was beyond dispute, and the only question therefore was, what amount of maintenance ought to be allowed her. The Master of the Rolls was in error in holding that she was entitled to a third of the profits as tenant in common. and therefore the order would be varied by declaring that Mrs. Castle was to be paid one-third of the profits for her maintenance. She must, however, pay the costs of the appeal. Lord Justice KnG11T BBUCE characterized the appeal as discreditable, considering the circumstances relating to M. Lord Justice TURNER concurred.

VICE-CaANCELLOPS' COURTS. MAV R0 IN RE THE BOYAL BRITISH BANK.-EX PARTE WALTON (Before VxcThanceU6r Sir R. T. KLUDERSLEY.) This case now came on upon adjourned summonses from chambers, the question being the validity of the transfer of certain shares by the executors of a r.Walton and by a Mrs. Rlue. These questions were argued in January and Feb. ruary last, when Mr. Paddison Gatherer and other persons were examined vivd voce in court, which proceedings were fully reported in The imaes, and his Honoar then reserved his judgment. On a subsequent day, the Court being prepared to deliver its decision, and the case being In the paper for that purpose, it appeared that a trial at laW was about to be disposed of at Westminster, in which the same parties -as to Walton's executors-and the same question-viz., the validity of the transfer, were involved; and it was therefore thought expedient to defer expressing an opinion in equity until the result of that trial was known. The case at law was afterwards turned into a special case upon two proceedings, and those are now pending. The csse is so fully gone into in the judgment that we give it without preface. Mr. Baily, Mr. Glasse, Mr. W. D. Lewis, Mr. G. M. Giffard, and Mr. W. Morris appeared for the several parties. The VICE-CHANCELLOR now said that there were two cases before him in this matter, one of Mr. Walton's executors, the other of Mrs. Rue. Upon the first, the question was whether Mr. Walton's executors were liable to be put upon the libt of contributories. The Royal British Bank was instituted in 1849 by Royal charter, dated the 17th of September, and according to the provisions of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 113, for regulating joint-stock companies, and the charter recited the deed of settlement. In July, 1849, Mr. Charles Walton was the holder of 20 shares in the bank; he died on the 16th of April, 1856. On the 19th of Anuust his executore. instructed Messrs. Hitchins and Harrison, brokers, to sell those shares, and on the 21st of August they sold them in the ordinary way, 10 to a broker for a hr. Remfry, and 10 to a person named Russell, who was a jobber. According to the usual practice, the dealer, though re bought on his own account, was not always personally interested, but named somne one as the purchaser. and Rus. sell named one Meston. No written notice was sent to the bank of these intended sales, nor any formal written a pli. cation for leave to transfer, but on the 28th or 29th of Aummst Amsell, who was the clerk to the brokers acting for Walton's executors, went by the direction of his principals to the head bankinghouse with the certificate, memorandam, and ticket, stating the name and description of the purohaser, and the amount for which the shares were sold, and wished instractionsfor the transfer, butthe transfer-clerksaid that there was no necessity for that, as the brokers themselves could prepare the transfer, and he gave Arnsell some blank forms printed, two of which were used and filled up and executed, and they bore date respectively the 30th of August, 1R56, and the 3d of September. These deeds of transfer were delivered, together with the certificates of shares, to the brokers for the purchaser; and on comparing the depositions of Amsell with those of Mr. Gatherer, the transfer clerk, his Honour came to the conclusion that the name of the vendor was not mentioned to Gatherer; at all events, it was not stated in the memorandum which the broker's clerk showed to him. On the 3d of September the bank stopped payment. and applicatious were made by the executors of Walton to have theirshares registered; but such and other like applications were refused. These were the circumstances as to Walton's case. Now, with regard to the transfer of shares in this bank, the Act referred to, the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 11X, the 23d sec., enacted that shareholders in any joint-stock bank might be authorized to transfer, subject to the regulations contained ia the Act and the provisions of the deed of settlement of the com. psany. Now, the deed of settlement prescribed the proceedings to be adopted for the transfer. The 10th clause of the deed of settlement was referred to In the charter, and provided that it should be lawful for every proprietor or person claiming under him, with the consent of the court of directors, to sell or transfer by deed to any person, subject to conditions thereinafter mentioned; that the same, when duly executed, should be delivered to the secretary, who should keep it, and enter a memorial to be kept at the banking-house, and should en,dorse the deed of transfer, and that such deed so endorsed should be sufficient evidence of the consent of the court of directors. The 11th clauso was in these terms .- " That the person proposing to make a transfer of shares, and the person to whom the same was to be made, should, seven days at least before the makling or executing of any such transfer, deliver to the court of directors, at tbe head banking-house, notice in writing specifying the number of shares, name, profes3ion, trade, and, if representatives, in what character, as well of the person proposing to transfer as of the person to whom such transfers were to be made, and the price or consideration (if any) for the same." The 16th clause provided that on any sale or transfer or change of proprietorship the then existing certificate should he given up to be cancelled, and cancelled accordingly, and a new one given to the new proprietor in respect of the shares transferred to and taken by him, and if any share was retained by the old proprietor, and a new one given in respect of the transfer, the production of any certificate should at all times be prirn4facic evidence of the proprietorship of shares. The 12th section was not very material, but it was, " that whenever any shares should be forfeited, and duly and effectually transferred and vested in a new proprietor, the former proprietor should (except as thereinafter provided) be released from all liability, and from subsequent claims of the company in sach respect, and from the effect of the then deed of settlement or any supplementary deed, and the persons who should take such shares should take them subject to the obligations of the parties transferring them." Those were the only clauses bearing upon the present question. Now, according to these clauses, to carry the provisions of the deed in all thewe terms into effeot three steps were necessary to complete the transfer. First, notice to the directors of the propoed transfer, specifying the number of shares named, and descriptionrf the trausferor and transferee, and the consideration. The notice was to get the consent of the court of directors, and seven days at least must elapse after such notice before the transfer could be made. The next was that, the consent of the directors having been given, thae transfer should be executed and delivered, not to the transferee, but to the secretary of the company, to be kept by him, and he would enter a memorial in the register-book kept for that purpose, and endorse it on the deed of transfer, and this endorement when once made was to be sufficient evidence of the consent of the directors. Thirdly, the old certificate, held by the tranferor, was not to be delivered to the transferee, but given up to the proper oficer of the bank, and a new one sealed with the seal of the company delivered to such trans. feree, and it wasobvious that nothing could be more reasonable than that some consent should be made requisite to the ransfer. In every joint-atock company and in every ordi nlaryv partncrsbip,-and was not this a1 partnership 1-and trading concern, no transfer could be made without the consent of al the partners; but in the case of joint-stock companies thiswas dconverted into a power given to some, andu iaccordingher wAct regulating joint-stock banks provided(forthe right totransf, be but subjeet to all the stipulatos in the tle Nothing could be more reasonable tha t of settlem}et should contain some restriction upon transfers, inasmuch as every abare. holder had an interest in parsons not being admitted who were not respetable ond responsible, and therefore that the consent of the governing body should be substituted for the consent o every individual shareholder, which it was in such a case perfectlyimapossible to obtain. So reasonable was this,that he (the Vice-Chancellor) believed there was hardly an iAstance where the consent of the governing body was not zequired. There was, however, one obvious ionon-venience attendling the necessity of consent to a transfer under an:' circam. stances,wbateverthe modifications mightlie,-that,inmsmch as the directors, who were to give consent, mntmtlow at least the niame and description of the intended tranafezee, in vxder $9 extrise a dkiseretiwi to give or 'withbo1d n4q consent, they conld not determine until after the name of the intended transferree was aseertained, which "could not be until after some contract for sale or transfer of the shares was made, andc therefore no such contract couldbe. made, except provisionally, and must be contingent on the event of the directors consenting." But still that inonvenience "did" not prevent its "being" reasonable, and ineidental to every case, notwitbhtanding, it was common in deeds of settlement, and wvs in this very one and in the charter in the operative part declared that the several regulations contained in the deed or any supplementary deed should be taken to be the existing regulations, exceptso far as they were altered andvaried by the charter. Besides this, there was a particular inconvenience; namely the seven days' notice, and this was so strongly felt that it was rarely required of late years, shares bemng frequently sold through brokers, and a blank form was given to get filled up, and then execated and brought to the secrztay, who laid them before the directors aud the certificates to be cancelled, and new ones substituted, and on their consent the transfer was registered in the proper book and the register wasendorsad on the deedof transfer, and then by consent of the court of directors the seal was affixed to the new certificate, and it was deliver to thetranaferree, and the effect of this practice, it appeared to his Honour, was not to waive or abandon the consent of the directors, but only of the seven days' notic-, postponing the consent to the time when the deed of transfer was ready for registration. That was the result of the evidence. It was argued that the delivery of the blank form by the transfer clerk was substituted for 'he consent of the directors, whereas if this was the object and intention it might be competent to the directors to bind all the shareholders by the introduction of a, practice perfectly opposed to the provisions of the deed indeed, the evidence negatived the supposition that any such substitution was ever thought of. It might he said that the postponement was a new inconvenience. It was a just observation, but only an extension of the ineonvenienceinherentin everydeedwhichontained the necessity of the consent. In every such case the contract inustbe provisional, and the practice in this company was attended with additional iBconvenience, but was counterbalanced by getting rid of the seven days' notice, not the consent of the directors. After al], the question was not whether the praotice admitted was attended with more or leas inconvenience, but whether it was the systematic usage by the company to dispense with the consent of the directors, and to substitute for such consent the delivery of the blank form? The claims of Walton's executors rested on the supposition that such was the case; that appeared to his Honour to be negatived by the evidence of Mr. Paddison, Mr. Gatherer, and Mr. Ansell-and that evidence was not contradicted by the affidavits on the other side of Mx. Humphrey Brown and another person, a broker. The cases cited did not appear to his Honour to touch this question. They, no doubt, established the general principles, that where a deed of settlement rescribed certain formalities for transfers, yet, notwitbstanding the omission of these, some act by or on behalf of the company, by which the transferee was recognized as a shareholder instead of the transferor, was binding un the company. His Honour then shortly referred to " yhewls case" (6 De Gex and S.), "Hartridge v. Bosanquet" (16 Beav.) " Gordon's case," " Maguire's case" (3fbe Gex and S.), and the other cases cited. Here no single act had been done, by or on the part of the company, by which the transfer had been assented to, or recognising the purchase as such, for it seemed impossible to regard as such the blank form.. His Honour was of opinion, therefore, that Walton's execators, as between themselves and the other shareholders, remained liable, but this decision did not affeot any question that might arise between them and the parties to whom the transfer4was made. Mrs. Hue's case vas different in circumstances, but the result must bo the same. Her case was this :-On the 1st of August, 1856, she instructed her brokers to sell her five shares, and after an ineffecaal application to the directors to enter them they were sold, and Russell, who bought them after some delay, gave the names Wiliam Alrey and W. H. SwiftAirey one share and Swift four. The transfer clerk demurred, and said that the directors might insist on the seven days if they chose, but this was ultimately waived blank forms given, and the affidavit stated that she believed consent was given by all parties (not by the directors certainly-that was a mistake). On the 30th of August the transfer was duly executed and handed to the purchaser's brokers; she ought to have brought the transfer with the old certificates, and have asked to have them registered and certificates sealed, but she did not do so, but left the purchaser's brokers to get the consent. Eis Honour then referred to the admissions of the official manager and others, which spoke to the practice of waiving the seven days' notice the sealng the certi(icate being the crowning act of all. M{rs. Hue, therefore, was also liable, without tou.ching tho question as betweenl her and Airey and Swzift.g Mr. GLASSE said, as this was a sample case he should not ask for costs; those of the official manager would come out of the estate. Mr. BAILY said, that he thought the parties appealin should have their costs. This was not, in fact, an appeal, for the chief clerk did not decide anything Mr. W. MoRRis referred to the cases of "Hutton V. Thompson" and " Bright v. Hutton." The VICE-CHANCELLOR said, that he could not give the parties their costs. EHe wished it to be understood that the chief clerk's decson could always be appealed from; I but here there was no common fund which belonged to all, and it would be making the other shareholders pay the costs of resisting a just claim. (Before FVe-Ghanellor Sir J. STuAnT.) iNAPPEBR V. DE.NDY. This case was taken after the short causes were disposed of, and occupied the Conrt the rest of the day. The question involved in it was one of account, and was totally devoid of interest.I hlr. lalins, Mr. Bacon, Mr. Jolliffe, Mr. Roxburgh, and Mr. B jgshawe, sun., were counsel in the case. (Before etOc-Chancedor Sir W. P. WooD.) PAINGOTON V. BENBOW. Mr. Cairns and Mx. Giffard appeared for the plaintiffe, Sir John and Lady Pakington, who had filed a claim to he allowed to prosecute an appeal in the House of Lords in the name of the defendant, John Henry Benbow, the plaintiffs offering to indemnify him against the costs of the appsal. The defendant was one of the executors of Lady Whalley's will, under which Lady Pakington was the residuary legatee. Lady Whalley, as one of the children of Mr. Thellusson, who died in 1797, was interested under his will, which has formed the subject of a well-known and long-protracted litigation. A decree was made on the 4th of June, 1856, in certain suits instituted by Lord Rendlesham and members of the TheUlusson family, the effect of which was to declare Lord Rendlesham and Charles Thellusson entitled to the property of Mr. Thellusson. An appeal against this decree had been presented to the House of Lords by some of the parties. The plaintiffs, who were not themselves parties to the suits in which the decree of 1856 was made, as their beneficial interest was Zrepresented by the defendant Benbow, as executor of Lady Whalley, had presented a petition of appeal to the HouIse of Lords, necessarily inserting the name of Benbow, their trustee. Mr. Benbow,, who had given an authority for the use of his narne in the petition of appeal, had subsequently withdrawn it, on the ground that he was bound to support the decree as being the solicitor of Lord Rendlesham, whose right was thereby established. The plaintiffs had offered to give him the usual indemnity, and it was alleged that the property in his hands, as executor, far exceeded any possible amount of costs which could bo incurred in the House of Lords. In consequence of the refusal of the defendant to allow the use of his name, the plaintiffs had filed a claim agaist him for the purpose of being allowed to prosecute the appeal in his name. Mr. BOLT and Mr. RENsH.Nw for the defendant contended, that he could not be compeUed to give the use of his name, being the solicitor of Lord Rendlesham,whose interests were adverse to those of the plaintiffs, and being convinced of the inexpediency of any appeaL The VICE.CHAN2CELLOR said that the defendant, who represented the interest of the plaintiffs as their trustee, upon receiving a proper indemnity had not the least voice in the matter. Here the case was rather stronger than the ordinary one. The only objection by Mr. Benbow was that. he thought the appeal unreasonable and that he was the solicitor of Lord Xendlesham. Lord Rendlesham, however, would know that the name of his solicitor had been simply used in the appeal as having the legal interest and at the requesl of his cestufsuc trust. It appeared that a complete and satisfactory indemnity had been offered by the plaintiffs, and there must be an order that they be at liberty toense the defendant's name on giving sen indemnity, to be settled in chambers, and the coats of ths claim must be paid by the defendant.
COURT OF QUEEN'S BEN(rr Wmr .w. - !2n THE LOCAL BOARD OF HEALTH AT HULL V. BARE XV-flR (SWiings in Banco, before fr. Justkee CojinE unl Me'. .Twtice CROMrTON.) This was a special case for the opinion of the Court, and it raised the queatlon whether the appellant, Barkworth, was entitled to exemption from the payment of a eneral district rate made by the Local Boardof Health at Vull, The appellant was a tenant and occupier of premises under the Hull Dock Company, and he claimed to be exempt from rates under the 121st section of the Hull Improvement Act of I854, by which In terms the exemption from rates and assessments made under former local Acts was continued to the Hull Dock Company. The qsestion turned on the construction to be put by the Court on the 121st section of the Impxovement Act of 1854, and the Act of the 41st of GeorgelI., chap. 30, for the improvement of the parish of Sculcoates, and the Hull and Myton Improvement Act, the bOth George IIL, chap. 41. llr. WAsRaNx, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Archibald) was heard for the respondent, and contended that the exemption was confined to the dock company individually, and did not extend to their tenants. Mr. MznusH, for the appellant, contended that the ex. emption extendci to the property of the dock oompany whether in the hands of the company or of other pates as tenants. The COuRT decided that judgment ought to be given for the appellant, and held that the exemption claimed was not personal, but related to the property itself, which was exempt from rates, whether in the hands of the dock com. pany or of their tenants.

When this case was called on, The SoiacIToR-GENgRA1 said, It would be for the oonvenienoe of the counsel in this case if the Court would allow it to be postponed till Wednesday next, as Mr. R. Hill, who was on the other side, was actually engaged in address. ing another Court. rJUtCe COLERIDGE said, the case might stand first for Wednesday. EX PART - Mr. PAsHLY, Q.C., moved for a rule calling upon an attorney, whow. name wa not mentioned, to show rcase Why a criminal information Shoud not be filed agalu him, The attorney was clerk to the magistrates in the borough of Newport, and was in partnership with a gentleman wh,o was clerk of the peace for the county of Monmoath; and thoe object of tho present application was to try -whether the attorney could laUegy act in that ca ity, or whether it was not in violahon of the Act of Paiament. There was no allegation of corruption, and no doubt when the Court expressed its opinion the attorney would at once obey. It was thought a more convenient and less expensive mode of trying the question than the proceeding by way of indictinent. hr. Justice CROMPTN.-Tho question is whether the clerk waa right or wrong. Mr. P.s y said that was so and he cited a case where the Court had granted a criminaf information for the nonrepair of a highway. that Justice CoIrRaDOGL said he was clearly of opinion tbat the Court ought not to grant the rule; but he would express no opiion on the Act of Parliament. He coald not say whether or not it would be a convenient mode of trying the question; but he would say that this Court never had granted a criminal information in such a case. The Court never interfered with the ordinary mode of proceeding before a grand jury, except under particular circumstances; and never against a public functionary except where there was an allegation of corruption. It was said that this mode of trying the question would be more convenient both to the attorney and to the prosecutor, but that was not a ground on which the Court ought to act. It would be estabishing a precedent, the consequences of which no one could foresee. ILn the case cited the Court had granted the information because there was resson to apprehend that there had been some interest with the rand jury which had prevented the indictinent from being found, and the Court thought it useless for the prosecutor to go again before the same tribunal. Mr. Justice CRoxPToN said the parties had no right to come, asit were, by consent and applyfor'a criminalinformation. This extraordinary remedy ought to be u,ed with the greatest care. His Lordship thought the rule ought to be discharged. Riule discharged. THE QUEEN V. THE ROTHEsRAM BOARD OF HEALTH. Flr. GARTH moved for a rule calling upon the Rotherham Board of Health to show cause why a mnandamus should not issue commanding them to make a rate for the disebarge of the prosecutors' claim. The prosecutors were contractort who had done some works for the Board, but, a large balance remainng tnpaid, they had sued the Board, and recovered a judgment for 1,0001. odd. Execution was then put in, but everything had been seized, under previous executions, with the exception of a sum of 751. odd, which the applicants received raJanuary last. The CoUET granted a rule nisi. at a httle after2 o'clock in the day Lord Campbell and MIr. Justice Erle, who had been occupied in the former part of the day in the Criminal Court of Appeal, took their seats on the bench, and 3r. Justice Crompton left for cha. bers. THE QUEEN V. THE INMARMT&S OP HUDDERSEmIJ. This was a case stated for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether "pregnancy" was - sickness" within the meaning of the 9th and 10th of Victoria, cap. 66, which emacted that no warrant shall be granted for the removal of any person becoming chargeable in respect of rehIef made necessary by sickness or accident, unless the justices granting the warrant shall state in such warrant that they are satisfied that the sickness or accident wl produce permanent disability. The pauper, a young woman, aged 18, was in service as a domestic servant, and was discharged on its being discovered that she was preg. nant. Being unable from her advanced state of pregnancy to take a situation, she was admitted into the Huddersfield UDion workhouse on the 21st of April, and was relieved as an able-bodied pauper. On t!ie 10th of May an order was made for her removal, but on appeal to the sessions, the sessions helithat "pregnancy" was "sicknes," and quashed the order, subject to the opinion of this Court on the question whether the pauper, being pregnant, though an able. bodied woman, was liable to be removed. She was not delvered tiil the 27th of July. Mr. PAsHm , Q.C., and Mr. NEEDHAx, in support of the order of sessions, contended that where it was stated a woman was unable, from her advanced state of pregnancy, to take a situation ehe must be considered as sick. According to the defiuition given in an American dictionary (Bouvier'sl the body was sick when it was "deprived temporarily of the ability to discharge its usual functions." Mr. M.&uLB, in enupport of the order of magistrates, said that, according to the definition cited, the woman was not sick, for she had the ability to discharge a woman's usual functions. (Laughter.) She was pregnant and ableboided. The learned counsel was stepped by Lord CAMzBEu.r who said he was clearly of opinion that this case was not within the 4th section. There wasnothing to show that she waa sick, except her Pregnancy. She had no disoase, and there was nothing to show she was not perfectly able to work at the time. She was ablebodied. M1r. Justice COLER1IWE was of the same opinion. Mr. Justice ERI,E said the intention of the Act was that the pauper was not to be removed where there was " sickness or accidenf'-i.e., where there was a morbid action of the body, occasioned by disease or by external violence. THE QUEN V. ALLDAY A-ND OTHERS, OVERSZERS OF BIRIMIGHAM The question raised in this case was whether the auditors of the Birmingham Poor Law District had properly disallowed the sum of 351. 15s. which had been paid by the overseers to the town-clerk for the preparation of an alphabetical list of the borough voter The list in question had not been prepared by the town-clerk himself, but by the printer, whom he employed and paid; and it had been decided in the previous ca_s of " The Qaeenv. Kingston-upon-Hull," that the town-clerk could not charge for what he could properly do himself, though he might for printing, which he could not he expected to do himself. Mfr. Seijeant HAYES end Mr. BIDDLSTON now showed cause aganst the rule to quash the auditor's order of dis. allowance, and contended that his decision was right. Mr. PASaLEY, Q.C., and Mr. FIxED supported the rule. Lord CAiIPBELL said he was of opinion that the rale ought to be discharged. There was no ground for saying that the appellant had laid out an money for what he might not have reasonably done for inmself, with the assistance of the clerks inhisoffice. He(thetown-clerk)had been allowedfor all theprinting and otherdisbursements, in accordancewiththerule which badbeenlaiddownby the Court, and which he (Lord Campbell) thought hAd beea acquiesced In His Lordship said he would repeat that it was satisfactory to him to think that there was no danger of the town-clerk's going without remuneration. He ought to be remunerated and that liberally; but it ought tobe in the shape of salary: and not by extra allowances, unless in respect of what he could not do as torin-clerk. Mr. Justice COLEnDGE and Mr. Justice ERLE were of the same opimon. Lord CAS5PBELL said the rule must be discharged, with costs.

Mr. Powell was counsel for the plaintiff and Mr. Hawkins for the defendant. It appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff, Mrs. Anna Ludbrook, that the defendant, a schoolmaster in Bunhillrow, is her brother. In 1851 she suoceeded to some property on the death of a Mr. Pochin; she advanced 501. to the defendant, who was residing in the Isle of Wight, to enable hiM to come up to establish himself in London. It was proposed he should pay It off by educating her children, but that arrangement was never carried out. She had since received 10s. from the defendant in payment of the loan. Some Chancery proceedings arose out of Mr. Pochin's will, and she had only received about 3001. under it. For the defence it was not denied that the money had been paid, but it was alleged to have been a gift. Plaintiff had been living with Mr. Pochin; he was anxious to settle 2,0001. on her, and asked the defendant to becormea trustee, proisinug him a legacy of 501. for his trouble. The settlement was not carried out; and when Mr. Pochin died the plaintiff was left sole legatee. She then requested the defendant to come and reside in London ; and to enable him to do so said she would give him the 501. Mr. Pochin had ppromised him. The l0s. had been a loan to the plaintiff. Several witnesses swore that the plaintiff had repeatedly stated to them that the money was a gift. His LOPDSHIP having summed up, the jury retired, and, after a short absence, returned a verdict for the plaintiffDamages 501.

The policy was effected on the life of one J. P. Jones, who in 1853 was in bad health at Liverpool, and his father sent him a voyage to the Mediterranean. On his return, not being able to attend to his father's business of a baker, his father took a farm for him in Wales, and in 1854 he had another serious bilious attack. The policy was effected in February, 1855, and the deceased at the time made the declaration that he was not aware of haviag had any serious illness tending to shorten life. It was contended that he was aware of his illness as a fact, and the illness was one of a nature calculated to shorten life, and whether ho 'was aware of the dangerous nature of the illness or not he ought to have mentioned it. The learned Judge directed that the statement of the deceaeed was true, if he did not know that his illness was one calculated to shorten life. Mr. lIIowLs, Q.C., Mr. E.

V This was a special verdict raising the questionwhether legacy duty was payable bY the defendant under the following circumstances :-In 1794, an ancestor of the testatrix hiss Elizabeth Ollive, entered into an arrangement, which may be assnued to have been usurionu, with certain trustoes, now in part repreaented by the defendant, for an advance of ,noney upon certain securities - como ising inSer aiia, 800,Three per Centat MIiss Olli-vehaving; become posaessed of an intereot in this, transaction by devise, it ap. pears that in 1841 a further advance was required by the defendant and the otherparties connected with the original transaction, and thereupon in consideration of her executing a certain mortgage to the proposed new mnortgagee, the defendant and the other mortgagee conveyed to her a frcah securnty over the stock which was the subject-matter of the o n' mortgage. Miss OIlive shortlyafter died, leaving 's wl, bywhich she gave andforboreto the defendsant Bhs e inthe stock which vas included in the original mortgage and In the deed of 184L The questlon was whether the defendant was bound to pay leg% duty on this bequest, his oblgation being resite on the ground that the original transacetion wa tainted with nry, wlhich pervaded the aeod arrangement. The Attorney-General, with w'hom were Mr. Seeant Pigott and Afr. Beavan, appeared for theCrown; Mr. Bovill argued for the defendant. The COURT nanimoudy held that the defendant was Bable to legacy duty, on tho ground that, whatever might be the character of the transation of 1794, that of 18t1 wa ^ rew and totally independent arrangement, constituting a valid legal debt to Miss Ollive, which she ecold hava enforoedagainast the defendant. The forgiving of this debt was a legacy, on which the duty attached. Judgmuent for tbe Crown. THZ ATTORBEY-GEIEBAL V. BIOGGIsN. This was also a special verdict, arising out of an information for legacy duty. It appeared that the testator died possessed of personalty to the extent of 92,00PlI in England, and of 6,000. worth of shares Ina Scotch railway, which are also personalty. The defendant, an executor, had proved in the province of York for personalty sworn to be under 100,0001., and had not taken the necessary steps to s&bject himself to the payment of probate duty in Scotland by exhibiting an inventory in the Scoch courtg. By the Scotch Act for Consolidating Raiway Clauses it it provided, inter alia, that on presenting an English probate to the secretary of a Sootch railway the executor would be entitled to be registered for the shares held by his testator, and this the defendant had done, so that he had got the benefit of thatprovision, and now sought to evade the payment of the specific probate duty on the Scotch property, alleging that as he had, in fact, enough duty in England he had virtually paid the burden. The ATTORNmnY-GENZeL appeared for the Crowrn, with MIr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Beavan, contending that the Railway Act did not exonerate the defendant from the duty of presenting an inventory in the six months, and so being fixed with the specifio probate duty chargeable on the Scotch ahare. Mr. MAptcsrY, for the defendant, argued that these shares were bona notaUlia in England, and that the Act had a wider scope than that amigned to it by the Crown, and that, as duty nad been paid in England on a sum which was large enough to include both English and Scotch personalty, he ought not to be called on to pay over again in Scotland for the Scotch shares. The COURT, howrever, adopted the construction propounded by the Attorney.General, and gave judgment at once, affirming the right of the Crown to the duty in question and holdig that the defendant as still bound to file the inventory.-Judgment for the Crown.

Serjeeut Shee and Mr. Prentioe appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Wo for thW defendsants. ic n o o h e Prom tho evidence adduced on the pert of the plaintiffit appeared that in January last a person named Bedford, then in partnership with the defendant, applied to the Vaintiff who carried on business in Birchin-12ee as a bill discounter, to discount the bill in question. Rand and Bedford were then carrying on business as saddlers in Oxford-street, and the plaintiff had previoualy done business with them. Bedford had endorsed the bill in the presence of the plaintiff. Mr. JAES said that he had no defence in law to offer, but the defendant bad been induced to defend the action in consequence of his having been defrauded to a lage amount by his partner. The bill in question bad never been entered in the partnership books, nor had the prooeeds been applied to the partnership account. A verdict wra-accordingly found for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. Some person in oourt then stood up and said that he was Mr. Bedford. He indignantly denied what had been stated by the defendant's counsel, and said that if he was put into the witness-box he would contradict it upon oath. Noperson being inclined to examine him, however, he was obliged to content himself with his statement as above. FLETCHR V. THE ENGLISIE WIDOWs' FruD.

Creasey were counsel for the defendants. According to the plaintiff's case he had been engaged as superintending gent by the defendants for the purpose of overloo}ing and appointing local agents in vanous towns. He had been engaged for three years certain, and he was to receive a commission upon all premiuma which either he or his agents brought into the office. However, at the end of two months they had dismissed him without any reasonable cause, and without any notice at all. On beingcross-examined the plaintiff admitted that he had employed another person named Blackburn to go about for him, and that he had accepted a similar appointment in the Householders' Insurance Company before he bad been dismissed by the defendants. He had received 201. from the secretary of the company, and had received 104 on account of some premiums which he had no right to receive, and for which he had rendered no account. The defence was that the plaintiff had neglected his business, and, instead of traveling about doing his best to promote the interests of the defendants' company, he had stayed in London and spent the money he had received for the purposes of travelling expenses. Ie had also received money ch he had nO right to receive, ad in consequence of these irregularities he had been dismised from their service.

COURT FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF CROWN CASES RERRRn AC -Or.ft THE QUEE1X V. ISTER AND ANIYITRRR (Present,-Lord CAIPBELB7 and.Tvaices WiLLiAms, EklE, CROwDE%, and Baror3 BRAxWEL.1 *1Ms case was argued before the five Judges of this Court, but those Judges not beina *ble to agree they ordered it to be argued before the 15 Judges, and last term the matter was argued before 12 of the 15 Judges, when time was taken for consideration. Lord C ArBm this morning delivered the judgment of the Court, all the Judges but the Chief Baron concurring. The CoURT were of opinion that this conviction ought to be affirmed. The defendant counsel began by objecting to the first count, but the Court did not entertain any doubts of ite efficiency. It alleged that the defendants unlawfully and knowingly did deposit in a warehouse belonging to them near divers streets, &o., divers large and excessive quantities of a dangerous, ignitable, and explosive fluid calle wood naphtha, and did keep the same in a warehouse in such large and excessive and dangerous quantities whereby the Queen's subjectepassi=g along and residing near were in great danger of their lves and property. The indictment did not allege that any noxious effluvium issued, or that any harm was done by it, but the Judges conceived that the depositing such a substance in such quantities to the danger of the lives and pro rties of the Queen's subjects vwas an indictable offence. he law of the country would he very defective if life and property could be so exposed with impunity. There was no ground for saying that wine and brandy could not be kept without rendering the party liable to fine and imprisonment; the substance must be of such a nature as to create real danger to hfe and property. It was enough to show that something had been done which the law ought to prevent. To manufacture and keep ganpowder in large quantities in crowded places could not be distinguished from naphtb^, and was held to be a nuisance, and was an indictable offence. The Court had next to consider whether the facte found were sufficient to support the indictment. It was found that naphtha was very inflammable, more so even than ganpowder, and if inflamed water could not put out the fire arising from it, unless employed in enormous proportions, and that without dispute a fire so arising and communicating with thesepremises could not be quenched, and would be attended with the most disastrous consequences. The jury also found that it was not the practice to allow any fire within the premises. These facts wouldhave fully justifiedaverdict of guilty, for, although no damsgo was actually done by the naphtha, the Court could not say it might not have been dangerous to life and property; It was only so long as great care was used that danger was prevented with great care gunpowrder might be lept, hut the law took notice that there might be ococsional negligence; therefore keeping a large quantity of gunpowder ina crowded place w considered to be a nuiance. The Court was caled upon by the questions submitted to it to say vhether where such a manufacture was carried on so carefully as to produce no damage, its liability to danger, ao extra might be a nuisance. If such a manufacture were in the locality of mining furnaces towDs might be detroyed, The nsphtha stored in this warehouse in the heart of the city of London might be exposed to ignition from various external causes, and a fire might arise vwhich could not be quenched. Upon the trial of such an indictment it was a question of fact for the jury whether the depositing such substances really did create danger to life and property. It was a question of degree. No geueral rule of iaw could be laid down beyond this,-that the substantial allegations must be substantially proved. In the present case the Court thought sufficient was addueed; and, although the judge would not have been justified in directing a verdict of ' guilty" to be entered without taking the opinion of the jury, he was fully justiflied in telling the jury that if the depositing the naphtha, coupled with its locality, created danger to life and property, they must find a verdict of 'guiltY. Whether the liability to ignition ao extra could properly tetd;enintoconsiderationbyRhe jury was reserved sor the opinion of this Court, and they must say yes, and that the conviction mu..t be afflrmed. The C}IIEP B~asioNthought thst there ought not to be aferred,dgment, but that another indictment ought to be pre- Conviction affirmed. THE QUEEi V. DANGER. This was a case reserved by Mr. Serjeant Kinglake, the Recorder of BristoL The prisoner was indicted for obtaining a valuable se urity by false pretences It was prored that the prisoner had stated to Richard Latham that he had purchased of one George Jenkins a quantity of leather. vhich was to be delivered to him that day, and he proposed to sell the same to Latbam for 1841. 10s. Lthan agreed to buy the leather. The prisoner afterwards took a bill ready drawn by himself on a stamp for 184. IOs, and asked latham to accept it. Latham accepted it, and handed it to the prisoner, who discounted the bill and *ppropriated the proceeds to his own use. It turned out that the prisoner had not purchased any such leather of Jenkins.

Lord CAMPBELL thought but for the difference of his brother Bramaell that tnis was a very clear case, The Act was pased to prevent people being imposed upon by persons professig to act under the process of the County Court. A fraudulent intent was here shown. The prisoner had pretendod that this was a process of the Court issued at his instance, and he had endeavoured to obtain froni the Party Is. 3d. for fees. Justices ERnn, WrLt aAs, and Cnowin concurred. Baron. Bn"wEuL had no doubt he was wrong, but he could not read the words of the st3tute as the other members of the Court did. He thought it wrong to create more ofences than it was possible. EIe had believed, but nou he did not believe, That the Act was intended to affect those wrho forged documents as of the Country Cou.

The prisoner, who declined making any defence, was fnlly committed for trial on the twofold charge of corraptly aking money to assist in the recorery of the property and of stealhng it. Bow-sTR=.-Sarah Kennard, who had been remanded for a week, charged with stealing a large quantity of waterproof capes and other property from the premises of her employers, 1ressmrE dmiston, of the Straud, was brought mp for furtber examnination. Mr. Campbell Sleigh, the barrister, attended on behalf of the pawnbrokers, Messrs. Alton and Walker, to remove any odium which may have been cast upon them by the observations of the prosecutor on Saturday last, when the case first came before the magistrate. He described his clients as one of the oldest and most respectable firms in the trade, and appealed to Inspector Checkley to say if they had not on all occasions, as well as in the present case, done their utmost to assist the police. The prisoner, it appeared, had been in the habit of pawning articles at their shop for three years at leasi,-not articles of this desription only, but articles of weaning apparelalso,and she had always represented herself as a manufaeturer strwgglingwithoccasonal ditiicLlties. Then,with respect to the imputation that the pawnbrokers had re-purchased the duplicates in order to be able to dispose of the property at once, this was not strictly true; the fact being that the duplietes were given up in several instances in consequence ofe waterproof articles pledged being of a perishable nature, and useless to his chents unless available at ouce. One of the firm here stated that they were the most respectable pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, and occupied the bighest standing. nMr. HE RB.-lles'y your counsel has said quite enough m your vindication;- you need not blow your owrx The inspOctor admitted that the firm had given him every asSistance. The prisoner was again remanded. GMLDHALL.-Joseph Smith, a porter in the service of Messrs. Cooper and Co., wholesale grocers, of Monumentyard, waasocha-rged with robbing his employers to a considerable extent. A detective officer who was set to watch the prosecutorse house saw the prisoner come out with a parcel, which he gave to his Wife. They went together into a publichouse, upon leaving which the prisoner carried a bag to an oil and colour shop in Aldersgate-street, kept by a Mr. Spioer ; there he took out a numnber of parcels containing tea, coffee, and currants. The officer went in and asked him where he got the articles from. He at first refused to tell, but afterwards said he had bought them of a person at wholeale prices, but be denied having got them at Mesars. Cooper and Co's. Spicer said before the prisoner that he always *mderstood the articles came from Miessrs. Cooper's. When theprisoner was taken into custody he admitted that the parcel he had given his wife contained 41b. or 51b. of sugar candy. This was afterwrards found in his house, together wi,th sever&l pounds of tea and spices. Remnanded. Charles Harrison, a foreman in the employment of the same firm, was charged with robbing his masters to a considerable extent. It appeared he had given delivery orders for large quantities of sugar to Mr. Anstey, a grocer, of High-street, Hoston Old Town, and h ad received the money for the sugar upon presenting the invoice made out upon bill-heads of Messrs. Cooper. He had supplied Mr. Anstey for 18 or 20 years in the same way, and had never accounted for the money received. Mr. Anstey, upon being examined, said he had always look-ed upon the prisoner as the agent of hessrs. Cooper, and dealt with him as such.

MR. HRADLAM'S MEDICAL BILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THEE TIMES. Sir,-I trust you will be able to find me a small space for a few observations on the account ina your paper of this day of a deputation that waited on Sir George Grey yesterday with regard to the BiDs before Parliament for the regulation of the medical profession. It was w7ith great surprise that I read in that acoount that the President of the College of Physicians stated that the profession were unanimous in their approbation of Mr. Headlam's Bill. Now, what tamount of unanimity there may be in the college overwhich he so well presides I am not prepared to say, but with regard to that large body of the profession-the surgeons -they have not been asked about it. The College of Surgeons (as repre. sented in the deputation) no more represents the body of surgeons than any three members of the House of Commons represent Parliarment. In fact, the Council of the CoUege of Surgeons consists of 24 gentlemen; the college consist of :12,000 more or less. The council is elected to carry on the business of the college; but with regard to this or any othAr measure the college as a body has never been consulted by the counciL It is the opinion, as it appears, of the President and two Vice-Presidents, gentlemen all self-elected into the council, that MIr. Headlam's Bill is a good one. I very much doubt from -what I have learnt whether the President can even get his council of 24, to agree in this opinion. I hear there are some who express a very different opinion as to its merits, but what I want Sir George Grey and the public to be informed on is that the surgeons have not been asked their opinion or expressed any. The Council of the Colege of Surgeons is elected to carry on the affairs of the College as at present constituted, and for the purpose of examining candidates for their diploma; but they have no right at all in their capacity as counciUors to pledge the large body of the fellows and members of the coUege, 'vithout even asking their leave, to any political measure -whatever. In the new charter granted by Her present MDajesty it is stated "that henceforth the corporate name o. sqle of -the said colege shall be the Royal Colege of Surgeons of England, and that a portion of the members of the said college shall be fellows thereof, by the name or style of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of :England." Now, the council in this as in other matters entirely ignore the fellows and members, and when they, the council, put themselves forward as the organ of the College of Surgeons it should be clearly understood that they represent themselves only. The first charter granted by the present Queen recognized a body as " fellows of the college." Now, the council, without ever in any way ceonsulting this body, appUed for a new charter, in which the position of the fellows was very much interfered with, and gained one before the felows were at all aware of the fact. Therefore I trust that members of Parliament will not be carried away with the notion that Mr. Headlam's Bill received the sanction of the College of Surgeons as a body. 3tr. Headlam's Bill I think a very bad one, and those who have been delegated by the Counoil of the Colege of Surgeons to assist in the preparation of it have, I think, allowed the real interests of the colege, as a scientific body, to be entirely swaraped. I think Lord Elcho's Bill the better Billof the two. With some alterations that might be a useful BilL I will only add that the body of apothecaries are in exactly the same position with regard to their governing body as the surgeons; but not being au apothecary, I will not enter on that part of the subject. That body have evidently had their interests well looked after in the cnnalav1A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENOLANn may 30.
THE CASUAL POOR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIAIES. Sir,-I am glad to see by a report in The Timnes of the 28th inst. that the deputation from the board of guardians of the Wect London Union, who waited upon the Lord hlayor on Wednesday last propose adopting mensures with regard to this most important subject, which I have, in common with a committee of gentlemen, endeavoured for some years past to press upon the attention of the Poor Law authorities and guardians, knowing, from experience, that the present system is calculated to promote and increase the evil which it is the duty and interest of the representatives of the ratepayers to suppress and it is equally certain that a more humane and effectual provision should be made for the casual poor of this great itetropolis. Under the present system of compelling the casual poor to wander from union to union seeking re, ef ;n greatly increase the claims upon each union -while at te same time you create vagrants y the very fact that, instead of dealing with each case at once, you compel the panper to tramp from union to union in order to pro^ure that which it is the duty to afford at once-relief. In order, however, to prevent injustice and an undue pressure, mid effectually to carry oat the great end in view, lt wiU be necsssary to embrace all the metropolitan unions. They should all, therefore, be called upon to contributo in proportion to the population, &E. I would submit the following plan-viz., that there should be four large establishments, to be situated east, west, north, and south of the metropolis, for the reception of the casual poor, each to be properly fitted up with baths, lavatories, dormitories, and workrooms; that a registry for procuring employmuent be attached to each establishmentthat a master and matron should have the sucorin. tendenco of each establishment, and that the whole should be under the control of a board composed of representatives from each union contributing to the fund; that the four establisbments should be under the inspection of an officer properly qualified, who should visit the several establish. xntnts, compare the registry, and repost to the board his ,obaervations, &c. The several establishments being in constant communication an effectual cheek would be given to rimposition, and the professional vagrant and cheat would 4hus be detected, and real misery and destitution relieved. This project has now been some years before the publo, Atbe late Mr. Alderman Hunter when Lord Mayor having presaded over a public meeting at the London Tavern for l.the purpose of promotiDg that object, in consequence of vbiCh a model establishmbent was fitted up, with baths, lavatories, dormitories, and dining hall, with gas cook=n' apparatus under the direction of the celebrated chef M 3,iybr,_att a cost of 1,6001. It, however, met with the tzro,gest ,opposition from guardians acd others, who con ,sidezcd it .nss calculated to Increase the rates by attracting and aqgienaing the number of the casual poor. After a lapse, horseverv, of five years the guardians of the West ILondon -Union (in consequence of the strong opinion ex. prelsed by thejhord MaDir, gathered fron personal investi. gatisu bad visitst.o tb9 casual wards and other institutions) have altered thetr4opiDions on the subject, and will now, i trest. treat the casibUa poor in a more rati.nal and humane mnanner, The ;odel Blablifibment bbove alluded to bas during tb.e pa6t five vinters, solely by voluntary contribhn tiions, aforded a large asotiit of relief to the destitute poor. uta it isi8 to be Iped that the authorities of the unions will now undertake the duty that ir reality devolves upon them, and provide in in effectual maaaeOr for the casual poor, anDa tins puti a atop toe aendicancy nn.d in a great meaEure to orImeI I am, i3ir, youv obedienti ga^vant, - TV. fn.Cl .}NRT1r)lUTT.

TlITHES oN PTLCHrorDS. TO THE EDITORC OF THE TflIS. Sir,-In Cornwall a practioe prevails ia many, place of paing a tithe on pilchard; it is enforced. on the gronda Of Mlnineorial customi- and there are scarcely two places wbere it. is Paid al~ike. At Alevagissey it is claimed as follows :-The owner of each pilchard seine pay 11. 13s. 4dl. per annum, whether there be any" fish taken* or not. and the mGen employed pay one-twelfth part of their entire shtare. As yott may imiagine, it is felt to be an intolerable hardship, especiaUly on the patt of the poor men, mnany of whom arem frequently in great distress Jfuring the winter maonths, when they cannot puisue their calling. As instanaces of the injustice of the thing I wil mention two facts. I know a man wvith a famnily who was employed in the pilchard fishery here in August 1last, and who ;wa rather successful, his share amounting to 7f. 14s. Id.; he bad to Day the vicar 13s. 8d. Since that time, during the winter, the man has been glad to obtaini emaployment on the parish roads at ls. per day to get bread for his family. T'he other case is that of a man whose share amounted to Si. 2s. 7d., ran who bad to pay the vicar 14s. 6d. Because of affliction during the winter be baa had to obtain relief for himself andafamily as an outdoor pauper. Earnestly hoping that fish tithes 2n Cornwall may soon share the imnpending fate of Ministerse Moniey in Ireland, - I remain vour obedlient ~-- WILLtA& DITNCALF. oevagissey, May 28.
IvMProoL, Saturday.-The advantages of the new graving docks at Birkenhead have been exemplified by the despatch given to the repairs of the screw steamship Khersonese. This vessel arrived on the 22nd inst. with a broken sbaft and minus her screw, and was docked next day in Mx. Laird's large dock. To-day she was afloat again, having ha&d several new plates put in her bottom, and a new screw shaft (which had to be forged) fitted. She will sail early in the week for Portland. Tan UNrvnnsirras.-Or Saturday were printed, by order of Parliament, copies of two statutes made by the respectie Jgoverning bodies of Trinity andPembroke Colleges, eambridge,underthe Act 19th and 20th of Victoria, cap. 83, and approved by the Commissioners on the 3d of Apri, and the 31st of March, 1857. Thestatutesrefer to the scholarships of Trinity Colege, and the Grindal feUlowship of Pembroke. Together with this document have been published copies of ordinances, framed by the Oxford University Commissioners, in relation to Merton, Pembroke, and University Colleges, in the 'University of Oxford, under the above reciteid Act. RoYAL COiLEGE OF SunGxows.-The following gentlemen, having undergone the necessary examinations for the diploma, were admitted members of the college at the meeting of the Court of Examinera on the 29th inst., viz. :-Messrs, Thomas James Triumell, Cape of Good Bope; Francis Hepworth, Croftsband, near Patricroft; Isaac Rowland;, Llanfer; Frederick Gull, Stanway, near Colchester; Richard Stonhewer Bright, Richmond, Surrey; Stephen WiUiam Watts, Army - James Pattison. Cromarty, Aberdeen; Herbert James, AMertbyr Tydfil; Henry Buss, Barnsbury-grove; Richard Wright, Dablin and Babu Rajendra Chandra Chandra, Calcutta. TE GOVEBN.SENT OF CE°YLON.-On the 17th of January last Viscount Torrington despatched a letter to the Colonial-office, reviewing at length his administration of the Government of Ceylon. The noble lord appears to have taken umbrage at the remarks of Governor Sir Renry G Ward, in a despatch dated the 9th of June, 18o6, setting forth the condition of the island of Ceylon at the clas ot | 1iSS, together with a retrospective glance at the policy of previous years, in which he states that he is unable to I account for its present prosperity. In reply, Lord Torrington proceeds to recaU the seties of measures originated bv him ror the liberation of com;erce and the encouragement of revenue, showing at the same time the fallacy of supposing that the public works had been neglected daring the period of bis administration, or even prejudicially suspended; that his government had waited helplessly "in the hopes of better times," or that no legislative I steps had been taken by him for the relief of the colony at the raoment, and for its future and permanent advantage. He found, he says, Ceylon in anything but a praoperous state; its treasury was nearly empty, its commerce declining, and its general condition rapidly leading to bankruptcy. He then eaters into copious detilsI to prove how assiduously and successfully he worked to I improve this state of affairs and to restore the prosperity I of the colony. He says that he had been but a short time in the island when he commenced to place upon record a series of minutes which became the basis of subsequent ordinances for the readjustment of the colonial finances; and that during the whole period of his administration preat and important public works were carried on, in spite of the series of financial difficulties which the years 1817 and 1843 brought uapon the island, in common with the rest of the I world. He says that during the first two years of his government, which have been represented as years of alarm i and inactivity, upwards of 30 ordinanees were enacted, seve-I ral of which were of a value and importance unsurpassed byI any subsequent legislation; and he goes on to submit figures and facts to attest that the great prosperity in the midst of which the present Governor finds himself, and which he is unable to account for, Is due mainly to the legislation of that period and to the financial arrangements then effected, coupled with the prudence and foregight with which the public money was husbanded without stopping any works of importance or pressing necessity. These details include an account of a new ordinance framed by Lord Torrington forth. amendment of the Customs' law and the revision of the tariff, the effect of which was the liberation and encouragement of commeroe, while statistics prove that his jcdicious removals of onerous duties were concurrent with a great improvement in the trade of the island, which the reform tended to raise to double its original amount. He also refers in detail to the sources of increased revenue and his "road ordinance," backing his assertions by extracts from official letters, vc. Mr. Lsaouchere replied on the 11th of February to the effect that he did not think it would be a proper or convenient course to express any general opinion on the merits of Lord Torrington's Administration- and he felt it the less incumbent upon him so to do, because he was persuaded that it was not Sir Eenry Ward's intention to cast any imputation upon his Lordship's Government ; but on the contrary, to declare that, in his opinion, the prosperity now enjoyed by the island of Ceylon is in great .part to Te attributed to the able and vigorous measures adopted by his Lordehip and Sir George Anderson, under very difficult circumstances, in order to plac the finances of the colony on a sound foundation. Tax GBE.&T EssATER.-Captain Harrison, comm-ander of the Great Eastern, accompanied by Sir 0. P. Roney and Mr. Yates, visited Holyheadon Saturday. They expressed themselves in terms of great satisfaction at the facilities which Holyhead affords for the reception of the Great Eastern on her first voyage to Portland, in conrexi'n with the through boocking system of the Graud Trunk Railway Company of Canada. The packet pier for the improved mail boats to and from Kingstown is to be im. mediately commenced, and if the suzgestions of Captain Harrison be adopted it can, at comparatively slight addi. tional cost, be made completely available for the Great Eastern. REAPING ANfAciamnS.-We have received, in reply to the letter of Messr. Bnrgess and Key, which appeared in our impression of Saturday, a second communication fron Messrs. Dray and Co., in which they reiteratethe statement that they were awarded the gold medal for the revping machine exhibitedby them at the recent agricultural exhi bition at Vienna. The gold medals at that exhibition they assert were awarded only to exhibitors of first-class imcloments which had been worked successfully, and they add that their representative at Vienna had never received the slightest intimation that the gold medal which they obtained had been awarded to them for auy other implement than their reaping machine, that having been the only machine which had been put prominently forward by them for competition. They impute incorrectness to hat which has been described b Messrs. BArges sand Key as "1the official" list of the ExAibiti.n, and state that their thrashing machine, inasmuch as it had been broken, could scarcely have been selected as worthv of obtaini-n for them any mark of distinction. The list furnished by a German agrncultural newspaper, which they expres it to be their belief was the only onc printed, and which is in their possession, makes reference, they state, to only 17 gold medals as having been awarded for implements at the Exhibition; whereas it had been asserted by Mes.srs Burgess and Key, with a view. in their opinion, of disparaging their success, that 36 bad been granted. In referring to thestatement of 17VA Timed correspondent at Vienna, they did not, they say, profess to quote his words, but had mentoned their having obtained the gold medal for the reaping ma~'hine as a simple fact.
