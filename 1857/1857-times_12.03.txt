RAILWAY INTELLIGBNOE. NEW YORK AND BERIE. A meeting of bondholders in thisi railway Nomp%ny was held yesterday at the London Tavern tO Teceive a report from tho committee appointed on the l8th .of November last; MSr. R. Campbel in the. chair. The report stted that the difficulties of the oompanyiiad arisen from the directors havlng been compelled, in order to secure A cortion of the floatingdebt, togiveto Mr. D. Drew, ot New York, a mortgage for the sunu of $1,800,000 with:a full power of sale, which extenaded over the entire lie, with all its franchiees and zolling stook. The oommittee Xt&to they are assured that so long as the lUortgage in question remains under Mr. Drew's control it id in friendly hands; but it is not to he conoealed tbat, owing to the present presgure for money in New York, it is possible Mr. Drew may be compeUed at any moment, by cirouinitance over which he has no control, to exercise At once the power of sale contained in his mortgage, an aet which =ight oblite. rate not only the bonds represented but the whole of the shsre capital of the corporatioi. The position of the company is therefore Alarming, ad it is consequently of the first importance that All parties intereated in tie bonri and shar capitl thus menaced with extinctione lhold use every effort to extricate the company from the critical postion in which it now stands. With this view the dirzctora in New York have' issaed proposals for a loan payaAble balf in cash or coupons due prior to the 31st of Oc. tober, 1858, and the other half in unrecured bonds; of 1D2, 1871, or 1875. The loeq in question it is pro to secure by a mortgage beering 7 per cent, interest. their investigation the committeo found that much mis. conception exists intbh minds of bondholders regarding the traffic of the line and-the etal podtion of their property, which many of them appear to have been Induoed to believe had become actually valuelew. The line extends over 498 miles of road, andl may be called the Loiedon azid .ovr49. Wester of Anerica6. Itoommands the hiefacto the Port of New York from Iake Erie and the Western country, the produce of which can reach the se faor export bya no other unbroken. rpute, and the frelghtg6e of wlich mnst always eoestitute to the line a never. failng sourc of revenue-.' The total cost, of the road amounts tD 15,120. e mile, or A tota of $37,800,000, of which $13,(0000 consist of mortgage debt, $1U,800,000 Unsecred Lbonds, $2,000,000 floating debt, and $1100000 shAr capital. The traffi has steadily progresscd from the opening of the line. The receiptz for the fort year, ending September, 1851. amotuied to 2Z359,870 ; ending September, 185Z to $8,537,706; ending term erefr 1 to $4,318,962; ending 1854, to $5,359,958; ending 1855, to 5 c488993r- asd for the year endin ep tember, 15 to hr349,0. For the latter year tnhe r4eBtp1ee amounted to $3,200,000, while, deducted from the hse ra ings (16,349,050), left $3,149,00x net earningsL a.Un I n from tben-et earninigs the interest ontih, bpnded debt. the rentofthe UnionRaiway, atd the ntorster on the floating debt, together equal Jo $1,900,(000 it appear, there was a net surplus of $1246,000 On the yese's operation, which was 7 a pIdend 'a the rate of II per cent. on the share capitaLe The roets of the Eriell Way maY therefore be smid to be eniourtgigx and they Ppea.r the more so *hen contrasted with the position of nighbourin, and anaRloyous undertakings, The eooamndex state that te present earnings of the railway ar about 1,200,0001. per annum, or 2,P,0l. per mitle. Deducting from this sum 1,501. per mie for working expenses, being 56 per cent, of the receipts, leaves a net result of 1,050. per mile, equa to 7 per cent. on the oDst of thewhole road, and Yt theO bonds now stood in the market at from 20 to 50 per cent. discount, and the shares of thn omrpany were helling at 2. 1a. for a 20gi share, The bondholders would perceive that the traffe of the line doubled itself in the first two yearise d hd already trebe itself in the sixth year from its opening. The vid o extent of country which depends entirely on the Erie Railway was daily adding to Jt popau lation, and thus year bynear lncreasng its wealth and extending its ctltivation. the present, chairman of the eosPn anticipatedthat theo untagof the Long DockTermliaus at New York whic add irteust $1,000,000 so the Annual rae ceipts. It is Intended to finish thibvery extensve work out ofte monyo now sought to be raised after liquidation of Mr. Drew's maortgae. The Long Dock wil permit large trading veiSel, drawing 20 feet of water and Inasuring 1,50 tons and upwards, to load produce from the nilWAY trucks, and thus not only add to the traffic of the line, but secure it against al future aggressive oompetition. The inters of the comPanY in the Long Dock Terminus wind be comPrised exclusively in the morage issed tolprsIn thie new loan, and, in the opinion o the committee, it eads most materially to the security now offered by the ompany to the snbetrbo to the newloa, The committhe beavecome to the conclusion that thesecurity therailwayroi era uae niably ample to over theamountvor the bon dsoAfwe as those advances which the directors consider requiste to extricate it from itg Presnt difficulties; and theY recommend that every exertion be made on theeprt of the bondholders to take up a proportion Of the loan" corresponding to their respeStive interests in the bonded debt of the company. in makingd this recommendation the committee comment lu severe terms on the reprthensible Practie which permits American railway nansgers to Ishe acceptances antd execute Ortgages without consulting their shareholders. In this instance the reslt of this vicious Proceeding has jeopardied the existence of the company, by the creation of a floating debt, to secure which the directors have be-en compelled by the necesities of the ti.mes to give a mortgage Wit h Summary power of sale over the whole of the company's property, which, if acted on at the present momndt, would undoubtedly extinguish both the bonded debt as mell As tho share capital. In the Prent chaiman (Mr. Charles Mtoran) and his asociates the committee believe the interests of the undertimng ha&v been confided to ns keeping. .f Thoe CecureAR, In moving the adoption of the report id the position of the company had been so fully sat by the8 comm-ittee that he need not occupy their time *ith mrny observations. There could be no doubt that it the interest of every one concernedl to extricate the perty frm th postion in -which it now stood, withsa w tO setAblish it on a soundta. It wath neeesaryto e $6,00,000 for that purpose, half in Ouetain bonds o eoupoois, and half in cash, To comPlete necessary Works, and to extinguis Mr. Drew's bond. He had no doubt that sbine of those who would not take uP the new bonds whent appued to would come rushing for them when, too late. It would he useless to.mak. representations tolthe directors in America unless they were backed up with money. They could thei demand that the open bonds should bhscured by a fifth mortgage, andl that no farthe liabilpties be incured without their consnt. Mr. LkscH thought the houdlholeam should have Avoc in the management of the company, as they were deeply intereete in its, success. Mr. sAusonS wished to know the amount of the new bonds that had been subscribed through the exertions of the cormmittee. It would b A loss of time, unesos they. It a sfficient sum. If Parties interested would not saubci{be some other plau must he adopted. Unlsw the bondholders came fOrward liberally their coupons would not be patrld Thoe CoAMf state that the sum of $1,500,000cee d been subscribed inAinerica, and about$V5%0,o0 inx England., Mr. Moran was at presnt visiting bondholders in runce andl Germany with a view to explain martters and oban subceriptions to the new loan. Aftler some1 further observAtions on the nooeity of ever one subscribing without delay, the reort of the committee Ws unanimously adoptae P Resolutions were pased requestLng the covmmittee to solicit And receive subscriptions ior the proposed new loan, and to openana 1o4twith the recakofEngn fuinthd joint names of Messrs CAMPbsll De Balis, And Gowran, and authoriLing the sommittei to enter Into negotiations With hthe directors in New York, and toe sakuchL arrangeMents dn maybe necessary to soeure the property. M. PAulSONS and por. CrsoWny had very confadene in th the result if the bondholders would subscie the requisite amount.

The United States' steam frigate Wabash, 44 guns, vwas at Colon on the 8th of November, and the corvette Saratoga, 22 guns, at Greytewn on the 4th. The Royal Mail Company's steamship Clyde was on the St. Thomas, Barbadoes, and Demerara route; the Conwray at Jamaica, the Dee on the Spanishi Main, the Derwrent at Barbadoes, the Eagle st Honduras, the Solent in the Gulf of Mfexico, the Thames on the Spanish Main, the Trent at St. 'Thomas, The intelligence from Jamaica by this steamer, 'wbich left on the 11th ult., is of no interest what. .ever. Governor Darling had convened the Legislature on the 10th, when he opened the business of the session with an appropriate speech, which was 3istened to with much apparent interest by the members of both branchea of the Legislature. The ,resent eession, it was expected, would be a very prolonged one, as there were mauy mesnures of the greatest importance which would demand much deliberation from both Chambers. Much fever prevailed, and there had been some fatal cases, -especially among Europeans. An officer, Lieutenant laoyd, of the yal Artillery, succumbed to an attack in 24 hours and his remains were interred ,on the 8th ult. The white Artillerymen ata-tioned at Port Royal had been removed to Newcastle, on account of the fever having shown itself. Mining operations continued to present a favourable aspect, and parties connected with mines entertained very sanguine hopes of their success. Mercantile business was rather more lively than It was at the departure of the previous maiL Henry :ranklin, for many yesrs member of the House of Assembly, died on the 8th ult., and his death ,reated a vacancy in tho representation of St. Thomas's in the East. The military authorities'had -been active in raising recruita to proceed with the 2d West India Regiment, under Colonel Whitfield 'vho arrived in the packet, to the seat of war in the East Indies. From De Cordov*as Mercantile ItteUigencer of the latest date we learn that the supply of American -stuffs 'was very scarce,-more so than had been known for years, the depressed condition of -fiairs in the States consequent on financial troubles having operated to deter shipments. This barren state of the market had naturally carried prices to a very high range, but consumption bhad been somewhat checked in consequence of the high prices, Pnd sales were very limited. In the article of flouf in particular, which was held as high as o2s., little or nothing wa being done. Of Irish butter the supply in first hands was trifling, and the price asked was 18d.; of American, 250 kegs sold at 15d. No alewives in market for the last fortnight, and codfish exceedingly scarce. Fifty barrels of cornmeal had sold at 22s., and 60 at 24s.; mow held at a higher figure. Coffee was quoted at 43s. to 44s. per 100lb. for intercolonial consumption. First deliveries of coffee were coming to 3market in small quantities; the crop pronised fair, but the prices quoted could not, it was expected, be -maintained. Mess pork had been sold in small parcels at 132s. and 134s.; and prime mesa at 1 O5a. Pimento continued depressed and heavy of sale, quotations remaining as at last maiL Logwood dull and declining in price, there being little or no demand for it. Stock of rice ample; last sale, 15s.

At Grenada the only event of the fortnight worth notice was the opening of the Legislature, with a speech by Lieutenant-Governor Kortright, and its subeequent adjournment to the 15th of December. The planters were busily engaged in preparing land for new cultivation and in setting their manufactories in order for the ensuing crop. In many places the canes will be sbort-jointed, in consequence of the weather having been rather dry in October, 1During the last fortnight the weather had been showvery. Some damage had been done in the p)rostration of canes by high winds and flooded rivers. There was very little shipping in port. The Court of Policy at Oemerara had met twice aince last mail, but the business transacted was of no pub]ic importance. The commissioners who went on an exploring expedition in the interior of the colony had returned. They had made some valuable discoveries, and found gold, platins, and iron In the British territory. The weather continued fine, and was favourable for ripening the canes. Manuiheturing operations were being carried on with vigour throughout the colony, and produce was coming in rapidly for shipment. Imports were in fair supply, 'with limited demand. E:xports were coming freely to market. The supply of tonnage was ample. The St. !Thonzs's Tidende of the 1]th publishes a decree from the President of the Dominican Republic, placing under blockade all the ports of Santo Domingo, excepting that of the capital. From the other West India Islands the intelligence is wholly devoid of interest. The ialands generally were healthy.
THE WEESTBBN BANK OF SCOTLAND. ---- 1b- (BY ZLELChIo AND L'TERNATIONAL TELEGItArH.) l GLASGOW, WD)NESDAY. The meeting of the shareholders of the Western Bank was held to-day, Mr. James Dunlop, the aenior director, in tho chair. About 400 were present from all parts of the 1 country. Ib was resolved to register tl4e company under the Joint-Stock Banking Companies Act of 1857. The CHAILRMAN said that the best endeavours of the directors had been thwarted by the late manager, who disregarded their express instructions and gave great advances to unworthy persons. The directors in their report said tWheir chances of resutming business were lessened by the provinolal agents going over to the Edinburgh banks. The ageats who had already seceded represent 2,000,000 of deposits, and agents repre.enting 1,000,000 more were In the act of seceding. The Interim M!anager read a financial statenrent, showing that on the 9ch of November last the ssets were 10,627,8241.; the: liabilities were 8,911,9321., leaving an apparent sarplus of 1,715,892h Up to that time the known and undoubted losses were 800,000Z. It would depend upon the course to be taken in the realizing and the commercial stato of the country to determine what additional losses railht accrue. A committee of eharehaolders was appointed to go over the books along with the directors, and report to an adjourned meating on the 17th of December. A proposal was maio toresuscitate the bank, but it could not In the meantim he eutertained.
TEE CITY OF . GLASGO W. BANE A meeting of the shareholders of the City of Glaggow Bankwas held in Glasgow on Tuesday afternoon, at 1 o'clock, in the Merebants-hall, to decide as to the propriety of registering the company under 20 and 21 lVotoria,cb3p.49, caled, I The Jolit-Stoek Banking Companies Act, 15T7. The bal was well filed, and on the platform were the bulk of tho directors of the bank. On the motion of Mr. Samuel Irning, Mr. Andrew Orr was caled to the chair ausi4 The CaaAs then said,- Gentlemen, at the request of the chairmanof the directors I occupy the chair on the pree sent occasson; and I beg to state that this meeting of the City of Glasgow Banking Company has been called for the purpose of considering whether it would be right and wise to come under the Joint-Stock Banking Companies Act of 18f57. The Joint-Stock Companies Act passed in 1856 did not permit of banklng companies coming under registration by that Bill, and in 1857 an Act was passed permitting jolnt-stock banking com. panies to register under that Bill, which is incorporated with the Act of 1856. At the time the Joint Stock Banking Companies Act was passed, Mr. Lowe, who promoted that Bill had conferences with all the banking companies of Engiand, Ireland, and Scotland; but particularly as regards Sootltmd, I believe, he altered and amended the Bill in many ways, soas to satisfy the Scotch banks; and he almost had the promise from thein that at a proper time they would put] themselves mnder the Act, so as to take the benefit of the registration. It does not appear to me, nor to any one wbo looks rightly at this Act, that it abridges our powers as a banking company in any way whatOever. I am clearly of opinton that it rather gives us advantages, rendering us a corporate body, givinv us the power of sueing and being aued as such, and hol ding property in name of the corporate body, whereas at present we req(e to hold property in the name of our managers, and all suc property, at the death of a manager, must be translorea iu a regular legal way. The Act does not in any way limit the Issue of bank notes, or the operationS of our ordinary business; in fact, all our powers will be as full and perfect as before registration. It has another advantage, which in our unfortunate position may be useful, viz., that in the event of any dissatisfied party making any claim he maust do so against the corporate company. This precludes the possibility of troublesome legal expenses which might be entailed upon shareholders by troublesome persons, of whom, I hope, we shall have none among us. (Hear.) I therefore do recommend, and itistheopinion of the bord of direction, andof many of the influential shareholders whom we have consulted, that it would be right and wise to puttourselves underthis Act, and register accordingly. (Applause.) For this purpose, I beg to move, 'Tbat it is expedient and proDer that tho City of Glmgow Bauk should be reslmtered nunder and in temnis of the Joinet Stock 3ankine Conspanies Act. 1857; that this meetiog, accordingly resolve and agsee to the Bin- being so registered, and authorize and emapower the directos to get ths registation effected acsaon as they may consider recesary." (Cheers.) lMr. CAmPBELL (Tillechewan).-It is quite unnecessary for me to make any remarks. It is perfectly evident that this is a safe measure on our part, and I beg to Lsecond the resolution. (Cheers.) The Cu fltAN-1 have been reminded that there is a belief, on the part of some parties, that limited liability is the effect of this registration. Now, no such thing occurs. (Hear, hear.) It does not alter the position of the shareholders as respects the liability to depositors or note. holders. It has no effect whatever in limiting the liability; in that respect we stand in the same position as before registration. There is inthe Act power for conducting the business of limited liability companies, but no bank cnn take advantage of thee, clauses. The bank remains in exactly the same position as regards themselves and the public after as before registration. (Hear, hear.) Such registration shall not take away or affect any powers previously enjoyed by said company of banking or Issuing notes, "or doing any otber thing' -these are the words of the Act. The CHIkRMAN then put the resolution to the meeting, and it was carried unanimously and by acclamation. Mr. DUNLOP (of Craigton).-This is a special meeting of the shareholders-na meeting called for a special purpose, and perhaps, in point of form, it would be irregular in me to make any motion beyond that already adopted by the shareholders. But I think, under the circumstances of the case, you wil probably permit the motion which I have to submit to you to be brought before the meeting. If the meeting is unanimous, as I hope it will be, the notion may be adopted. Many of you are aware that after the bank got into its difficulties a meeting was hurriedly called together of a number of the most influential and extensive shareholders of the bank living in this neighbourhood. At that meeting the directors asked a committee to be appointed to co-operate with them in conducting and looking into the affairs of the bank, and advising with them as to what they thought was best to be done. The committee then appointed oonsisted of the following gentlemen:-Messrs. Lewis Potter, Bruce Paterson, William Campbell, W. P. Clark, Hgh Baird, W. Mlitinnon, Daniel Gilchrist, Sir William Dunbar, Jamles Mackenzie, aud James zLne. That comInittee has been meeting with the directors, and has gone along with them in any steps they have taken since the suspension of the bank. The proposal I have now to sub. mit to the meeting is tol the following effect :-Tbat the directors and the acting ceommittee of sbareholders be autho. rized, and are hereby authorized, to appoint a committee oonsisting of two shareholders, and five otber gentlemen unconnected with the bank, to investigate the books and the affairs of the bank, and to report forthwith ; and that, of the five gentlemen unconnected with the bank, two shall be public accountants of eminence, and three gentlemen of high commercial standing. (Cheers.) I think you will agree with me that the great object we should have in view Is, as far as possible, to restore public confidence in the bank (cheers), and 1 think, notwithstanding all that has happened, ihat we really are entitled to a return of public confidence. (Cheers.) We were, at a very trying period, assailed with a run upon the bank, for which certainly we were unprovided, for we must confess that we ought to have been better provided for such an emergency. we had been directing our attention, perhaps, too much to making a large profit by the manner of conducting our busi. necs, thus securing large dividends to our sharebolders; and extendlng our business, without having saffiiently inview the danger we incurred by so extending our branches, in the event of the occurrence of such a crisis as that by which we have been overtaken. In fact we never contemplated such a crisis, Dad conse uently we were found to be too little prepared for it. We must confess our faults - had we been only able to foresee the late calamitous evenls we might easily have provided against any suach contingenoy. But since the bank has been forced into Its present positiou we certainly must have lost to some considerable extent public confidenee, and we think that such a measure as I have now proposed is necessary in order to restore public confidence. (Cheers.) I hope that, when our affairs are carefully investigated, it wIll be found that we are In a position to go on, and that we should receivathe cordial support of the other banling institutions of the country. (Much applause.) You must be quito aware that without their friendly support and concurrence it would be very difcult uphill work for us to carry on business; but I think we are entitled to their support. (Cheers.) It Is the first time we have had to ask any favour from them, the first time they have found us at fault, and at fault in a wy7 which, considering the extraordinary state of commereia affairs, there may be some apology tor. (Hear, hear.) But, at all events, let us have a fair and honest statement laid before you and before the public, and abide by the consequences. (Great cheering.) A SHAREOLDER In the body of the hall said, prevlous to this motion of Mr. Dunlop being seconded I think there is one thing should be added. I fully agree with the proposal itself, but I think there should be a limited time for the committee bringing up their report. (Hear, hear.) hfr. DuNLOP.-That is an omission which should be put right. WVhat we propose with regard to that is to adjourn this meeting till the 8wth of December, when we expect to have the report. A, SirAnuuoLDE (of Edinburgh).-I iwould saggest that one of thoseaccountants should be selected from Edinburgh, so that Edinburgh shareholders may have full confidence in the report; and I would al30 suggest, if not too late, that i the name of Mr. Walter Mal,,olm be added to the commnittee. The CHAiRmA..-Perhaps yoathad better allow Mr. Dunlop's motion first to be seconded. Mr. CL-Rx then rose and said,-In seconding the motdon I may state that I have been on the committee since it was appointed, andhavefoundlthatthe directors have been paying every attention and using every endeavour to set the bank agoing. It is often asked, " Why does not the City of Glasgow Bank open its doors P' Busines men do not require to have that question answered for them; but for the take of parties not acquainted with business operations I may say that the amount of notes taken out of our bank during the run was very great, and ihese must be met with money. We have plenty of good healthy securities, but these are not at once available. Our impessdon is-that is, the Impression of the committee-that the funds of the bank are entire, and that the rest is entire, and that the whole of the bad debts incurred during this severe period wll be covered by the profits of the present half-year. (Cheers.) With such a conviction we do not fear strangers coming to Inspect the affairs of the banlk. It was suggested to> us to-dayi by a parson in a high position thu's we sionld agree to this. and we at once acceded to thc proposal. (Oheers.) Ibeg to second the motion. l A& SUAXBHfOWERl-Dis the 4irct p.id tag whoIe ov mi.t- e concur in the sta.tement now made, that the funds of the bank and the rest are intact, and that the profits for the last half-year cover the loases? It will be satistictory to the sbareholders and to the public generlly if1 0e-directorsa and the committee will give their word, as. gentlemen of honour and s British merchants, that auch is the case. (Bfear, hear.) The CEuiRsrA%.-ThebaJance forthhalff-earrhasnotyet been struok, but in the course of a very few days the whole matter will be laid before the shareholde% Our belief Is that tho fact is as stated by Mr, Clark, but the figures wilL Dot be wrong when they are shonWr, and wo expect in very few days to have the half-yearly b3lanr6 Struck, and the whhole matter brought clearly before the shareholders Mr. DUNLOP.-There are alwvys two modes of viewing a business of this kind. If you ko to realize tbe' assets at a time of great depression it would nfke a great difference from estimating them as part of a going bnuines. It is difficult to answer the questiou directly on that account. . SHAiu EHOLDER.-Teil when do yonpropose to adieoun this mueeting ? Mr. DUNLoP.-Till this day week, to receive thls report, if pocsible, as it is important to have it s 'eatly as possible. (Cheera) Dr. MACFARLANE.-I am delighted to see snci a respct. able and numerous meeting, and I regret exceedingly that the names of the gentlemen present are not taken do6n. and put on record, that whatever we do 3nay appear to be done vith their concurrence. (Hear, hear.) I particularly approve the proposal of registration under the Bank Act f 1857. I consider that it would be for the advantage of the whole, and particularly becaute, when we go on again, as I hope we shall, we shall be put on the same *antge ground as the chartered banks. (Cheers.) This wil be the effect of it, and we therefore should be very glad that an: opportunity has been afforded to the partners to gve their opinion that the registration should be gone on with. Sir William Danbar was proceeding to add;ess the meeting when the proceedings were again Interrupted by the incoherent protests of the incredulov4 small depositor against any remarks not having directly for their object the date of repayment of sums under 601; A general cry of 'Put him out " getting up, he politely expressed his readiness to leave the hall, which he finally did amid a volley of hisses, with a parting assurance that he was quite disposed to give the directors all reasonable time to settle matters, and ful confidence in the ex Lord Provost. Sir WinLrAm DUNBcR MP., then oproeeded,-Gentlemen, there is still anotter point wvicb requires to be brought under your notice. It was stated by Mr. Den. lop, and I think by anothdr gentleman, that the affairs of the bank are considered to be in a satisfactory poal. tion-in fact, in a sound condition. The very fact of the motion having been made by Mr. Dunlop, tbat an independent committee should be appointed for the purpose of investigating its affairs, is, I hope, proof positive of that. (Applause.) We have also been told that the losses have been comparatively trifling; at all events, that a halfyear's profits will about suffice-to extinguish any losses that miy have occurred during the commercial pressure. I must say that, under these circumstances, it is matter of regret to me, as I am sure itmust be matter of regret to all of you the shareholders, that we should have to consider how or In vhat way tho doors of this bank, which under proper ptecaution, and with perhaps a more prudent system of management, ought never to have been elosed, maay be again opened to our oustomers. It has been very generally urged agaist the management that we have extended our branches too far, that we have pushed our business too much beyond the seas-I mean ia America; and that we have not kept a reserve for an emerge-cy such as has overtaken us. In these respects it is issid that the management has not been conducted on the strict principles of banking. Now, gentlemen, in all these respects I believe thero is a good deal of trxth in what is said, but at the same time I am not come here to indulge In reflections, and jrstice requires me to say that the American agency has certainly entailed no losses On the contrary, I believe it has been productive of considerable profit, and oui branches bave done well. Therefore, whatever the opinion may be of the discretion exercised by the management in pushing their business beyond what by some may be considered its proper limits, we bave the facts before us that the results have been the very reverse of unsuccessfuL (Applause.) Gentlemen, but for the folly, and I will call It a folly, of not keeping a reserve for times of pressure, we should have had imdeed little to complain of and as little to regret at this moment. There have been some persons who have, as I tbink, been indiscreet enough to blame the charter banks for not coming immediately to our assistance, ithout 7eflecting whether or not they have the power to do so, and without reflecting whether it is a daty incumbent on them to assist at all a rival establishment. N ow, with regard to these institutions, remember that safety -individu31 safety-is and ought to be their first consideration. It is a first duty which they owe to their share. holders. No doubt they exist as national institutions, and, as such, they are to a certain extent responsible for their acts to publlc opinion; but I say it is not for those who would carp at them to reflect upon what they bave done, or to state under what circumstances they should exercise that responsibility. The plain English of the matter Is this,-if Glasgow is desirous that a banking institution ,which peculiarly belongs to this city should be maintained, I say it is the business of the people of Gogow to maintain it. (Applause.) It is Glasgow that has placed us in our present difficulty (hear, hear); it should be =lasgow should help us out of that difficulty. (Applause.) I would appeal from absurd distrust of a senseless panic to the more sober reflections of returning confidence, and I would ask whv is it that the merchant princes of Glasgow, men we are told of untold wealth, have not come forward to assist an institution -which nobody disputes Is solvent, and which has been of the most incaluolable benefit to this, the second commercial community within the empire ? (Applause.) When we consider the circumstances in which we are placed-when we consider what a void the obliteration of such a bank as this would create-when we consider the calamitous consequences with which a winding up would be attended, both to the commercial community and to the large body of shareholders involved with it-many of them poor fomales-then, I say, gentlemen, it is our duty to use our utmost efforts to come forward now and subscribe to the guarantee fund which it is pro. posed should be raised to place this establishment on the footing on which it ought to be placed, (Applause.) I do not know if I reouire to add any more, but i do say this, that if we wish to nave help we must first help ourselves, and that, having helped ourselves by coming forward as we ought to do, and liberaUy subscribing for the maintenance of this institution, we should use eyery mode in our power to persuade the inhabitants of this great city of Glasgow to go and do likewise. The guarantee fund which we propose to raise in the shape of a loan to the bauk is about 500,0001. I ought to explsin that in the course of a few weeks this bank would, out of its own resources, be enabled to resume businesa, as I believe the money falling due within the next two or three months, includin cash advances and such like, does not fall much below 2,000,0001. It would b9 a monstrously hard case in such circumstances that we should be compelled to suspend for want of the comparatively limited assistance we are now endeavovring to secure. I will read you the document which has been placed in my hands with the view of raising funds for the purpose of placing this bank in a position of independence:- I *8 The undersigned hereby agree to advance to the City of Glasgow Bank, when called on, the SmIs written opposite thtir respective names, it being understood that the same shall be repaid. by the bauk with interest within 12 months.' A SERIEHoLDER.-The rate of interest, if you please? Sir W. DuNAsR.-The directors conceive 6 per cent, will be a reasonable rate of interest. Mr. CASExWELL (from the body of the hall).-I consider itwouldbe sufficientto say- The undersigned agreeto lodge in bank the sums opposite their names, to be repaid on three or four months' notice," I am perfectly satisfied that such a sum could be raised in Glasgow, the general feeling being that the City of Glasgow Bank should reopen. If such an Idea were taken up, Ithink the public would comeforward and support the baDk. Every day we remain closed we aroelosing large sums in the shape of depo8its, and I think, were such a plan as this adopted, the people of Glasgow would come forward and sabscribe within a week the whole sum requiredato open. I have already spoken to a number of persons, and I think every one is perfectly prepared to come forward and support the bank; and I am also satisfied that some of the lords and dukes who are so anxious to see Glasgow out of its difficulties will be quite ready to come forward and help it by lodging their money and getting interest for it. Sir W:iLmAm DuirntAn-I believe there is a similar failure in Edinbugh, and I believe many parties would come forward and do as you say. I think the suggestion a most excellent one, and one which I should strongly recommend to the shareholders. Following upon your saggestion, therefore, the motion would run as follows:- "Theuudes,s-,edhereb7 agree to deposlt l theOilyof Glasgow Bank on the day the bank open,, or within a week thereafter, the sama written opposite tbher respoetive name, it blWag umderstood the same shal be repaid to them by the bank, wlth interest at the rats of t per cent., at four months' notice." I bave made the term of notice four months, because that is the term our other depositors have agreed to. Mr. CARSE WELL expressed his concurrence in the terms I of thls motion, which was seconded by Mr. ROBiEaTsoz. Coun OU OD. clllrMAcdep9thden o rey satisfied Councilor C O\V.- hopathe directors axe satlsfied tata trs motion wilt meet the diaiculties we are placed in I would not wish to raise objections to this advance, but it occurs to my own mind tbat a motion of this kind wouldhave come up better this day eight days, after we had received the report of the committee that you are now about to appoint to investigate the affairs of the bank If that report be, as 1 anticipate it will be, and as the directors and other gentlemen associated with them have assured us it will be, of a gratifying description, I am quite sure that we would be all the more ready to contribute wMingly and largely towards the setting of the establishment in a proper position. If this meeting, how ever, should think that it is better to gO into that subscription or proposed advance to-day, I do not for one moment object. I state my own impression, and I think I am warrantedin saying I state the impresslonof a number of "entlemen sitting around me. That is aU the objection I nave to offer. Mr. CARSEWELL.-I went down to the meeting last Thursday in the City-hal, and found that aU the talking that was going on there would do nothing to open the two banks, but that some motion such as I have now suggested was required. However, tiere was so much apathy and SD much praise for other establishments, as compared with ours, ihat I saw it was useless to attempt it. I found one member had a great deal to say about the Union Bank. It did not appear to be known to the meeting that he was a large shareholder and director there. I delayed the motion on that account; and I think if we delay it again we are losing time. (Applause.) Every day the bank remains shut we ran the risk of losing our branches and a large number of deposits. Now's the time-there is no use of delay. Sir W. DuNBAn.-I agree with the gentleman who has just sat down, that time is of very great importance indeed, Paries who deposit are required to deposit on the day the bankopens, orwithin aweekthereafter. Itisquiteclearthat if the report should he unsatisfactory It is very unlikely the bank would open under such circumstances; so that the morley wt,uld niot reqnuie to be pad On the other hand, if the report-as wea expect it will-prove satisfactory on all points, and show the bank perfectly solvent and capable of* goin cI citit~QWn tdeqitdn~ Otn31te apeel ihe sooner we open the bettr5 that, to mony may be got Mr. WnsoN..If you give 5 per cent. to thow who are n3ow givin Ir deposits, It stAnds to reason that those who formerly agreed to leave th'eir depositsat fou.rmonthia' notice wi)lexpect the asatn. .

DIIA.-You Are aware that these depodst are to be made with the bank in the nature of a guarantee fand, to ponbla the bank, to open at the carliest moment and therefore it is proposed that 'the rato of interest sho;ld be somewhat higher than that on ordinary deposit, on the dis. tinct understanding thaLt they shall not bo called upon without four mnonths' notioe.

That question baa been freely spoken of In the city, and I have no doubt that on a, satisfactory answer to Ithe confidence of the smaller shbreholders willmuch'depend. Mr. Low.-I may mention that the traniter books were closed on the 10th of last month, the doors were closed on the 11th, and all transfers up to the 10th entered- but any trasafer of stock tladng place on the 11th weret entered, butdeclined by the directors. Mr. DurnLor.-There are no transfers permitted now4 The resolution hav3ng 'boen unanimously approved, the meeting adjourned till next Tuesday at 1 o'clock.
THEH ROYAL BRZW BANE. A meeting of the shareholders of this bank van held last evening at the Guildhall Tavern, to receive a report of the progress made In raising a sum of 180,004, neoessary to effect a compromise of 6s. 6d.in the pound, in addition to the 10s. in tne pound expeced from the estate. The CHAXBUN (Mr. Wyld, MP.) aaid proposals had been rdeeived from sbareholderswhioh be might arrange into three classes. From class I proposals had been received to the amount of 65,405., and which had been considered satisfactory. These shareholders would consequently obh tain a release. From clasm 2 proposals had been received to the amount of 27,9651. These proposas were under oonsideration. From clue 3 proposals to the amount of 2,0151. had been received, which were regarded as less atisfactory. The principle upon which proposals were generally considered satisfactory was the payment of 150. per share. Mr. HARDnG said the amiount promisedwas95 385f. The committee had very carefaUy gone over the list of share. holders, and the numerical result of proposals was this:In 80 cases the proposals were satisfactory; in 12 further evidence was equired; 56 were under consideration and there were 105 petsons vho had not made any proposal. whatever. The 95,3854 would barely sufflice to pay 4s. in the pound out of the required 6sd. Xr. MIToxu, intimated an opinion that If all the shareholders would come forward honestly there would be no difficulty in raising the required 180,000 Ho instanced six persons who-were the holders of 102 shares, who had offered only 9,00,0, whose contribution ought to be 23,ODO0. MT. Wvnl) observed that the remarks of Mr. Mlithell showed the propriety of the course taken by the committee. It was the intention of the assignees to give discharges to shareholders whose offers were satisfactory, and to apply the amount received to the payment before the end of the year of another dividend, whatever the amount might be,whether 2s. or 3s. in the pound. Mr. GILLoTT stated that he had, 'with the greatest pos. sible effort on the part of himself and friends, paid 1504 per share on his 26 shares. His business had fallen offMfMly one-third in consequence of the uncertainty of his position. The reguirement Of 150l. per share ought not to be applied as a rule. Many of the shareholders were tradesmen who had been knocked down by this unfortunate affair and who felt thd difficulties of their position in apeculiar degree. Mr. TAYLoRsaid that of the many pinful duties imposed upon him durtng a somewhat long mercantile life none had equalled those he had had to discharge as an assignee under this estate. The assignees were obiged to make inquiries Into the private affairs and position of shareholders, and to receive their statements upon affidavit. He believed that the 6s. 6d. in the pound would bo realized for the creditors; he had not the slightest doubt of it. He said this taking Into account the amount that would still be obtained from original shareholders. Mr. D2KLArTER cited the cas of an unsatisfactory offer from a shareholder who, to his own knowledge, had 20,000 in Consols. The meetings to carry out the compromise had done some good. With many of the proposals the assignees were satisfied, and a considerable sum had been reahzed. From that time every other shareholder must be dealt with piecemeal, and they must be told plainly that forbearance was now at an qnd. Those who had contributed honestly would obtain a release; those who had not contributed honestly munt be made to do so. The assignees never bad and never would relinquish the terms of compromise; from the 6s. 6d. in the pound they would never swerve for one moment. 3Mr. WYLn repeated his opinion that the compromise could be accomplihed by theraising of the required amount. The parties acting with him had been inuenced throughout by feelngs of benevolence and mercy in a matter that to a certain degrees might be considered a public calamity, and they would not relax their exertlons. It remained now for every shareholder who had not yet done so to do his duty,
THE 2ORTRUMfBEREAND AZVD DURHAM DISTRICT BASK. A mee9ing of the shareholders of this unfortnnate company is called for the 15th inst., "forthe pnrpose of recelving and considering a statement of the affairs of the said company, and of adopting such resolutions with respect thereto as may be deemed expedient; and generally to con- der and decide on all questions, measures, matters, and things that may be brought before such meeting relative to the company or the business affairs or concerns theroofand to make a call upon the shareholders in the said company in resuect of the share held by them respectively therein." The public of the northerh towns appear to be prepared to wait until this meeting Is held, when a, full disclosure of the affairs of the bank is anticipated. Messrs. Lambton and Co., of Newcastle, opened a branch bank at Sunderland onx Monday. Trade Is extremely dull, btt the reaction consequent upon the stoppage of the "District" is less violent than might have been expected. There are varioun rumours abroad, but until the meet of the shareholders it Is probably the most prudcent course to leAve them unnotioed.
CoNSECRAIoN OF A COuECH.-Yesterday the church of St. Paul, in the Westminster-road, was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, the bishop of the diocess A large number of clergy and a respectable congregatlon were present. The church, whichihas been built from a design by Mr. W. Rogers, the architect, is in the early English style, of about the 12th century, and is remarkable for its simplicity and beauty. It will accommodate 1,200 persons. After prayers and the usua formalities the Bisbop of Winchester preached a sermon from the 19th chapter of St. Luke, verses 41 and 42, "And when He was come near He beheld the cty, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thlno eyes," Ia the course of his discourse the bishop alluded to the large amount of spiritul destitution and infidelity existing in the distriot, and to the efforts which had been made by the rector of the mother church (the Rev. Mr. Cadman) to alleviate it, telling the congregation that they might greatly assist in the geod work themselves by becoming fellow labourers. A collection was made, and the appeal made by the bishop was liberally responded to. ST. JAu&S's Rosi: EOR PFNo -1R S..-We understand that an asylum has been opened at Whetstone, Finchley-comnmon, for the reformation of fallen women of a class somewhat sUperior in point of education, social standing, and comparative inexperience in vice to the great majority of those who are to be found in most of the existing refuges and peiitentiarles. It is to be called the St. James'sl efage and Homefor Penitents, as having originatedwiththeparish of St. James's, Piccadilly,lbutit willbe open indifferently to applicants from all parts of the metropolis or of the country. Accommodation has been provided fir 20 penitents under a l*dy superintendent and an assistant. The Bishop of Landon has consented to act as visitor of the institation,and the Rector of St. James'a will be the President. The want of a house of this peculiar kind has long been felt by all who have had to do with penitentiaries. At a time when public attention is being more thin ever directed to that " great sain of great cities," which has of late years increased to an extent seriously menacing to the health of society, and strenuous efforts are being made to check it by the prosecation of persons keeping houses of ill repute and the closidn of easinoa, it is gratifying to find that a regard Is being paid to the welfare of poor " unfortunates," who are, after all. in great measure only the victimas of a corrupt state of society, for which every individual is in some degree responsible. Any attempt to improve the penitentia system on however small a scale wiol ibe welcomed by all trae hbiknthropists,
ITHE GOVrzRNoB-R.GERAL OF IDIS. TO THE EDITOR OP TE TIMES. Sir,-As a rule, the English hatioii is jst and generous tqwards those who serve it well. Admirable as have been the courage, patience, and self-devotlon of the small band of heroea who, on the soil of India, have won for themselves aed their country imperishable fame, they have not, and will not have, any reason to complain that they are nlot appredated by their countrymen. Haveloclr, Lawrence, 3Wilson, Outram, Nioholson, Neill, Greathed-it w1il be ldng before the light of well-merited popularity which sdrrounds these illastrious names will have oeased to xlqine. .But unquestionably cases do occur in which the national jiggment in regard to the conduct of public servants is atMangely and signally at fault. In the present mtinee, wby is it that, while the attention of the world ia Sxed In tonishmont and admiration on the succesfal stand mnde by our countrymen iE India against odds which api piared desperate, the head of the executive Govermment of that oountry-the prime mover and controller of these events-has received from the unthinking clamorons eensure, from the more thoughtfuI aud influential cold indlfference, or (at best) the damnation of faint praise? Lord Canning had scarcely assumed the government when he found himself placed in circumstances of difficulty unelampled in history, of peril more tremendous and rcspon. siility more anxious than perhaps have ever before bes et tie tenure of great power. Of the mode in which he has niet those diffloultiee, of his tone and bearing in that greab extremity of danger and adversity, of the details of the measures which he has taken to encounter that terrible crisis, we kow but little.

I roENGLISH POLIcy INDIA. TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Way I beg a few lines of your crowded columns on a subject of pressing intereet? Presumig that we dshU rconquer India, and mean to keep It, it is already an urgent question, on what principles are we to govern it? 1L "India must be kept free from external war and from fturther expansion." War has emptied her treasury for 20 years together, and by emptying has impeded internal im. pxovenient, The Persian war, bg denuding India of English troops, made the present outbreak possible. In fature to dcfaw from India English troops or ships must be totally forbiddez. 2. "The high lands of India-north, central, and southmust be systematicaly filled with European colonies." Mr. Hyde Clark, in a recenat pamphlet, has shown how, by liberally granting land to railway companies, railways might be made and English colonization be facilitated with certain benefit to the Indian treasury. The Indian Government Tust become as liberal in grants of land as it hitherto has been stingy, and its own reaervea of land will quioliy double their prioes. Nothing but a large European population can morally or politically improve India under our rule. 3. " English citizenship must be recognized in India as a distnct element, and be cautiously imparted as a reward to Is9dlviduals, to classes, and to places." All who know any thing of the Roman empire wlll understand by a word the immense moment and urgenit need of this regulation. 4. " Well defined political, as well as social rights, should be granted to all English citizens in India." Not only should they be eligible as now, but their influence should be actively felt. The unofficial English voice should be heard publicly in authoritative places. Al should be eligible to be justices of the peace, as well as retain trial by jury, of which it has been sought to deprive them. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press should be guaranteed to Engliab citizens by Imperial statute. " 5. The Indian Government must not fluctuate with English party, nor its policy be made subservient to the s4ifting politics of Europe." Therefore, in no case should itfs " patronage" be thrown to the Ministry of the day. ' 6. The permanent burdens of India must in the long run, bo borne by India." To this end the English citizens of India should be subject to the same taxation as the provincials, and the taxes should be voted in numerous publie Indian Parliaments, consisting of Eoglish citizens, and of none beside. The Executive should demand the xu4m, and state for what purposes-apportioning it on the local Parliaments. Public aocounts of expenditure should be rendered to them, ;That mode of arranging the future government of India which would most simply apply these principles appears to me likely to be best. The least violent method is for the English Parliament to vote principles, and com. mrand the existing Indian Government to execute them. The most effectual method (but not likely to be adppted) would be to make a child of Queen Victoria king Or Queen of India, under sanction of a treaty to last for 30 years, after which India would become a wholly independent kingdom. An intermediate method would be to institute a standing committee of Parliament, to be reelected every year, as the supreme authority for dietating general principles to India, and for exercising all that pa tronage which must necessrily flow from England, wow to construct Indian Parliaments would be only a secondary question, though highly important still. Each migbt contain three sorts of members, co-ordnate in power -men elected by the unoffical English cltizens of India; others appointed temporarily by the Crown; a third class appointed by the Crown for life-namely, wealthy Indian landowners, vho would make a resident native nobility *bound to the English interest. Evidently a totally new course is needed, or all the horrors yet Teeldng will recur. Now is the time to change our principles, while we keenly remember those honrors. I -- - F. W.

LONDOZN THURSDAY, DEEMBER 3, 1857. This day the Imperial Parliament. meets for an extraordinary Session. The Qu(;&f ulmnmons the Lords and Common, to counsel at an unusual period of the year in consequence of the grave disturbance which has recently prevailed in the commercial affairs of the country, but, happily, rather to ask their acquiescence in that which is past than to provoke discussion upon organic changes for the future. The cauaes and results of the recent mone. tary disturbances are at least well understood The course which the QuzrEs teponsible advisers have xeen fit to adopt In the midst of the turmoil and confusion which have recently prevailed in the commercial world is so entirely sanctioned by precedent that we cannot anticipate any but one conclusion to the deliberations of the Iegislative Body. However grave may be the circumstances which at the presnt moment afflict certain portions of the empire, it is well it should be clearly understooad that Parliament is convened to-day chiefly,-we may say, solely-to give its xanction to the extraordinary measures of relief which were necssitated by the commercial distres conequent upon over-speculation and incautious credits. It is not our wish to anticipate the paragraphs of the Speech wbich the Qutsrs adviers place in EER M.JESTsS hands according to time-honoured custom. We entirely disclaim all offcial authority for the few suggestions which follow. Time -was when the communication of a few garbled extracts of the intended Speech from the Throne was made the subject of offcial mystification and of specila favour. That time is past. All men, however, who are practically engaged in political affairs are fully aware of the subjects to which a Royal Speeeh must necessarily make passing allusion, and of the general policy which muxt be foreshadowed as likely to be that of the Cabinet upon each particular point. The Speech from the Throne is on a grander and more majestic scale, similar to the address which a candidate delivers from the hustings when he would secure the votes of a constituency. The chief political incidents and polh. tical requirements of the day are briefly passed in' review, but in such a maxner as may leave the greatest latitude of action and present the nar- rowest front for attack. All this is as it should I be. We have no wish to see substituted in the place of the general and formal programme with which the proceedings of the British Parliament are usually opened any more precise and definite declaration of a general policy which must neces- sarily be kept subordinate to the tenour of passing | events. We do not look for a lengthened emsay upon the universa aspect of political affairs such as is customary on the other side of the Atlantic at the opening of the Legislative' Session. We are content that the QuzE's advisers should briefly exprem their opinion upon the half-dozen most important events of the time, and as tersely and succinctly as they please indicate the general policy which it is their intention to recommend for the adoption of the SOVEREIGN. Viewed in this light there can be no I great difficulty in anticipating the general features of the State document which will in a few hours be made public as the Speech from the Throne. First and foremost comes the financial difficulty. Upon this point the Ministers will ask-and not in vain-for the sanction of the Legislature to their recent act. To what lengths a currency debate would run if sufficient time were given for the elaboration of every dream and the discussion of every delusion it is not for us to say. Suffice it for the moment to announce that the Quzues advisers will not seek to reopen the whole question, but will content themselves with asking for that indemnity which has been granted to their predecessors under precisely similar circumstances. The definite course to be adopted will, we believe, consist in a recommendation-first, that the sspension of the restriction on the issue of paper by the Bank shall be left open until Parliament shall reassemble in February next; and, s&zondly, that the Brnk Committee of last Session shall be reappointed to consider the whole subject in all its bearings. This is the only point upon which the two Houses will be asked to come to a decision befote the Chrismas rees. The Speech, however, which will be delivered from the Throne this day is not a mere introduction to a Session of three weeks' duration; it is the programme to which Lord PALFERSTON ancd his colleagues will be held until the grouse shall again flutter forth in tempting flight upon the Scottish hills. As such, the policy of the empire in its more striking details, as well as in its general aspect, must be pawed under review. Of course, the Indian Mutiny and its consequences will claim a large share of attention, and the Lords and Commons will be asked to consider whether a more permanent guarantee for the future tranquillity and prosperity of British India might not be derived from a revison of the complicated sytem upon which its government has been conducted for the last seventy years. The Sesion, to all appearance, will be mainly occupied with the consideration of this topic. There has been a RomanCatholicSession, a Reform Session, an Income-tax Sesion, a Corn Law Session, and the one now about to open will to all appeaance be an Indian Session. It wiU be well if this should be so, and if the nation would consent to postpone the consideration of other business of lem pressing importance to the paramount necessity of resettling the government of British India upon a sure and permanent fouudation. A course, however, so simple and so business-like is scarcely to be expected from a popular assembly which of necessty deals with so many pledges and promises. For the satisfaction of those who have more anxiously and more peculiarly turned their attention to the home policy of the empire we may then venture to suppose that there wil be a paragraph in the Royal Speech announcing the deterniination of Ministers to redeem their pledges upon the subject of Parliamentary Reform. Such a paragraph there will be, and no doubt with the most honest intentions on the part of the makers to redeem the promise it will convey; but we may reasonably doubt if one Session will be found long enough for the consideration of Indian Reform and for a serious discussion upon an important extension of the Electoral Franchise. Upon European policy there will be little to say, for our relations with the other States of Europe are now upon a perfectly friendly footing. The DanubianPrincipalities, the despatch of our Envoy to Nicaragua, and the Slave Trade, may claim a _ _ _ _ . . .. . . -- - pasing notice, but these minor topics will sink into nothing as compared with the subjects of more general interest which we have already named. We are compelled to add that there is one point which, doubtless, the QuEEN's advisers would fain pass over in silence, but which will be necessarily recommended to the special attention of Parliament -we mean the distressed condition of the operatives in the manufacturing districts. An ungenial Christmas, we fear, awaits too many of them. The arrangement which has been made with regard to the relief of the Jewish Disabilities,-namely, that Lord JoHN Russi,?L shall introduce a measure in his own name, but with the asurance of Government support, will obviate any necesity for allusion to so vexed a point. We can only regret that Lord PAzauxnsToN should abandon to his great political rival a measure which has always been carried, and with inCreaSing majorities, in the more important of the two Houses. Such, we believe, will be substantially the chief features of the Speech which will be delivered from the Throne this day.
Parliament will this day asemmble iu extraordinary Sesaon for the despatch of wrgent business, and,though the question of the Bank Oharter Act may be the first to present itaelf 'under the category of emergencies, the great Indim discussions to be expected in the spring will certainly be anticipated by prolonged debates, although there will probably be no proposal oli which an immediate decision need be taken. Such a subject is too important and absorbing to be, kept in reserve, and the events of the last two months have rendered it even more interesting, though happily less alarming, than before. The aspect of the case at this moment is not a little remarkable. Our Indian empire has incurred a most terrible peril, but it has also accomplished a moet wonderful escape. Our authority in Eindostan has been shaken to its very foundations; but it has, nevertheless, by its own inherent stability survived the shock. Our countrymen and countrywomen have in some places perished under outrages so diabolical as to call for the most signal retribution; but in others their incomparable heroism has triumphed over every amault, and upon the balance of the whole struggle we have decisively conquered. The game, in short, has been a dreadful one; it tells heavily egainst our policy that it should ever have been played; but, as a matter of fact, it has been won, and. our power is established more solidly than ever. For some time to come it Will be natural to speculate on the circumstances in which this monstrous mutiny may really have taken its rise. The investigation will probably furnish much useful intelligence, and assist us in maturing sound views on Indian affairs; but, for ourselves, we must needs say that after the experience of the last six months we have ceased to think that the inquiry will reveal any extraordinary secret. Looking at the constitution and materials of the Sepoy army, we are compelled to regard the explosion as a catastrophe which was likely to occur at any moment and froom almost any cause. The caso was literally that of a powder magazine, and, though even gunpowder will not explode without a spark, fire may be struck from so many and such slight collisions that there is little marvel when the event actually arrives. It might, we really suspect, prove a more edifying subject of investigation if we were to collect and contemplate the various expedients by which the catastrophe was7Taverted up to the present year. The real wonder is not that the Bengal army revolted, but that it did not revolt till the year 1857, and we should probably find that many a wise and politic measure had been foregone as the price of its sufferance. It would be fortunate if we had nothing but Delhi to point to, or if we could bring forward the examples of Agra and Lucknow without having our attention arrested at Cawnpore. But there is no disguising the fact that we have had our affictions as well as our triumphs, and that even the victories of WuIoX and Avp.LocK cannot effce the recollection of outrages offered to our name and nation. Could any possible efforts have saved the Cawnpore garrison? If that rescue could have been accomplished, the reflection that it was left undone would be terrible; but th, simplest of reckonings seems to relieve us from so deplorable a conclusion. The very day on which the decisive intelligence of the Sepoy insurrection reached us-the 27th of June-was the very day also on which Cawnpore capitulated to NrAA SAHB. The culminating atrocity of the mutiny had actually been perpetrated at the moment when its real proportions were first announced to us. To have arrived at Cawnpore in time for the rescue troops must have left these shores in February-a period at which the defection of the Bengal army would in this country have appeared as incredible a contingency as an irruption of Red Indians into Canada. Whether we did at last receive a colnviction of the truth, and discern the full force of our obligations as soon as we ought to have done, is another question. There can be no doubt that we were blind to the course of things before us. The event has made this plain enough, but reason and fairness require that we should judge not merely by the event, but by the circumstances which preceded it. The Government of this country was slow to credit the true meaning of the mutinies, but in its incredulity it did but follow its natural guide-the Government of India. The Government of India has less justification for its error, but it can point, at any rate, to the emphatic and unhesitating assurances of the authorities best qualified to keep it truly informed. When the mutineers had deluded their own commanding officers into a reliance upon their loyalty,-when the very men whose daily lives -were passed among the Sepoys transmitted to Calcutta the most positive reports of the fidelity of their regiments,-it is hard to see what evidence could be taken in preference to this. True, there were examples of open mutiny, but when had there not been? Sepoys were always expostulating, threatening, and revolting. The first explosion was simply identified with one of the periodical outbreaks to which occasionally a fanatical panic, but more frequently tyrannical presumption, had impelled our Brahinical ievies for many years past. 'Unhappily, delusion at one end of the chain brought delusion at the other. The Calcutta authorities believed the Bengal officers, and our Home Government believed the Calcutta authorities, so that troops which might have sailed from England in April or May did not sail till July or August. Yet it is but just to recollect that when the real state of things was once discovered the exertions actually made in the despatch of troops to the East and in the formation of reserves at home are almost without parallel for energy and success. I is no slight thing to have sent off 30,000 soldiers on a voyage of 16,000 miles in the space of two months, and to be able to say at the end of that period that we had still as many fighting men at home as we had before the first detachment was embarked. AS regards our future policy, three broad general conclusions may be regarded as established by the experience which has been compressed into these six eventful months of Indian mutinies. First, the military strength of the Indian Government must no longer be based upon a dominant Sepoy army. This moral is now so clear as to admit of no dispute. It has now been proved by irresistible evidence that the materials of insurrection in India are in the first instance wholly, and from first to last almost wholly, confined to our own creations in the shape of native soldiers. Whatever may be the operation of caste, the institution never exerts any overt influence upon a Hindoo's demeanour towards his rulers until he has beenenlisted for military service, equipped with militaryweapons, and fused into a well-organized military array. If there had been no Sepoys there would have been no revolt, and so purely professional, indeed, is the proved character of the insurrection, that to this very moment even the contagion of overt rebelion has hardly infected the population of the country, except in the peculiarly situatd province of Oude. For the future, our military estabshments should resemble those of the armies by which Delhi was taken and Lucknow relieved -viz., they should comprise natives in numbers enough to give a good auxiliary force, but Europeaus in strength enough to play the principal part and insure the fidelity of our allies. Secondly, the personal capacities of Indian officers of both services have been placed beyond reach of doubt. Nowhere could better servants be found for the reorganization and administration of India. Such anadmirable machinery should be at once taken up and employed to the best advantage. Thirdly, this machinery should be allowed its full play by the substitution of a responsible Govermment for a divided Diroction. The compromise of prerogatives which his rulted from nearly a century of jealousies and contexts has been sadly prejudicial to the efficacy of our Indian Adminigtra. tion. The authority exertea in such an Administration should be direct and vigorous-not distributed between departments or wasted in a cirÂ¢uit of transmission. Fortunately, whatever care may be required in the adjuwtment of details, we need apprehend but little difficulty in the general arrangement. On the military point our course is clear, for the Sepoy army has achieved its own destruction, and it has been proved by experiment that the maintenance of a sufficient European army in its place is easly within our power. The servants of the Company give us the best possible machinery ready for instant employment, and if the corporate functions of this ancient body are superseded by agencies better adapted to the times its deeds and its glory will still survive in the splendour of the empire which it won.
The necessity of passing an Act of Indemnity in favour of the BankDirectorsfortunately involves nO reason for hasty legilation. The principles of curreney have, from various cause, been at aU times discussed with considerable warmth, and the commercial body has only just emerged from a panic. Few men would wish that their future fortunes should depend on a decision formed when they were angry or when they were frightened. The members of the Government and the recognized finsncial authorities of the House of Commonx are especially bound to protect the country against any hasty impulse towards change. With few excep. tions they had themselves long since deliberately made up their minds, not only that the paper currency should purport to be convertible, but that a self-acting machinery should seCure its conversion. The reasons on which their judgment was founded still retain their validity, although it is fair that fuU inquiry shouid be made into the circutstances which occasioned the recent violation of the law. Before conceding any modifieation of the existing system, its advocates ought to understand whether they are dealing' with mechanical details or virtually giving up the whole theory which they have hitherto profesed. It seems scarcely possible that any relaxation can fail to facilitate a repetition of the extravagant abuse of credit which caused the late misfortunes. The defenders of sound doctrines will not want for support in the country. It is a curious fact that while political parties exist side by side in every district, the different forms of opinion on currency are in a great measure locally grouped in the different centres of trade and manufacture. Birmingham has for a Iwhole generation harboured the extreme sect of papermongers, represented by the MnTnuzEs, the ATwOOnS, and the SpooN=. The Scotch system of banking has, not unnaturally, fostered the easy commercial morality which has lately found 0 somany spokesmen at Glasgow. The capitalists of Manchester and of its tributary towns hold sounder views of the relation between wealth and credit. It is a remarkable cirumtanc that the trading districts of Lancashire have voluntarily dispensed with provincial banks of imue.. The great bulk of their transactions is carried on by means of private securities, without any actual transfer of money; and the currency which is necessary for their business is furnished by the Bank of ung. land. The Chamber of Commerce at Liverpool, although divided in opinion as to the Bank Charter Act, seems to entertain sound views as to the causes of the recent panic, and Its members not unreasonably congratulate themselves on the manner in which their fellow-citizens have borne the sudden pressure occasioned by the American bankruptcies. Few mercantile houses have fallen, though the Borough Bank furnishes one of the least creditable instances of joint-stock rashness and mismanagement. The traders of Liverpool are not of opinion with Mr. BucHANA, of Glasgow, that no overtrading has taken place. Mr. BusnmL34 the Chairman of the meeting held on Tuesday, made some highly judiCious obxervations on the abuse of credit. " It is " shamefully abused," he truly said, "when "it has no other foundation than a bold and "reckless, daring, which, regardless of all con"sequences, deals with hundreds of thousands " as if they were grains of sand, upon the " principle of ' Heads I win, tails you lose."' The demands for unlimited facility of discount are equivalent to a desire for a stil further infliction of spurious credit. " The system," says Mr. BuSHEL, " is carried on chiefly by means of bills " of exchange, and seeing there must be three "parties to each bill-a drawer, an acceptor, and, "last not least, a discounter-it seems reasonable "that if capitalists, money-lenders, discount "brokers, and bankers would regard the character "and means of those who hold these bills more "than the magnitude of their transactions, they "have the check-strings in their own hands." The injuries inflicted on the community by the reclkless advances of certain joint-stock banks and money-lenders are by no means confined to the sufferings of creditors or shareholders on the collapse of unsound adventures. The fair trader, who employs capital of his own and legitimate credit, is outbid or compelled to submit to an artificial rise and fall of the markets by the competition of rivals who must buy to employ their borrowed fands, or sell to pay off their most pressing liabilities, in the hope of obtaining renewed credit. Forced exports, high-priced imports, and unfavourable exchanges are among the natural comsequences of unlimited banking facilities. There is reason to believe that within a recent period speculations of this kind have done much to raise the price of raw materials, and, consequently, to diminish the profits of manufacturers; and ultimately, as in all cases of illegitimate trade, it comes to the turn of the consumer to suffer. If the Liverpool merchants have been comparatively exempt from the errors which have been so widely committed, they are fairly entitled to the commendation bestowed on them in their Chamber of Commerce. It is not surprising that some of the members should have expressed an opinion that the Bank Charter Act had failed. The measure adopted by the Government suspended the experiment before it had been fully tried. The Bank had done its utmost, in concert with other money-dealers, by raising the rate of discount to 10 per cent. aud it might eventually have been compelled to withhold all further advances. The trade of London would have been in confusion. Numerous firms would have been forced to close their doors; and wide-spread misery would have been the conaequence. But what would have been the cause ? The crisis had been brought on by a wilful disregard both of the legisative restrictions imposed on the paper currency and of the legitimate principles of commerce. The Bauk of England had given warning; it had endeavoured to check the drain of gold; the action of the law, as far as it had been really operative, must have been in a great measure bene. ficial, but the great discount house believed that the Government would give way at the last noment, and, as the result proved, they were correct in their anticipation. The Bank Charter fully and fairly carried out is yet untried. Restriction may be useful even where It is not sufficient to prevent calamity. Mr. BRueL's piles, and hawsers, and hydraulic rain have from time to time failed in launching the envathan but they have undoubtodly tended to prod,io'th result for which they wero designed. The principle of the Bank Act in reltion to commerce is that |crodit should, as far as it can be regulated by currency, be proportionate to capitaL. Unsound traders naturally fiad thAt Xuch limitations are by no meaus conducive to their interests. The inauries which their competition infficts on the legitimate merchant not unnrequently involve him in the necessity of obtaining aocommodation under circumstances which give him a distaste to the stringency of the existing law. But additional encouragement to speculation would only aggravate the grievance. In its primary sad most indispensable object Sir ROBRBT PEE's Act has been eminently sucoeful. The value of the bank-note has never been questioned, inasmuch as its convertibility is fully received. There has been a general rush for discounts; but there has been no symptom of a run for gold. At a time when the American banks, with their legal liability to convert their notes, have nevertheless supended cash payments, it is not an inconsiderable advantage that' no similar risk has arisen on this side the Atlantic. The law provides that the money in the hands of the community should be precisely that which it both requires and has the means of obtaining. The collective amount of paper and gold is regulated by the amount of gold which would circulate in the absence of paper. The law is only artificial IQ SO far a it checks the purely artificial creation of a paper currency. The watU, with all its machinery of wheels and springs,' corresponds with the solar time. Any scheme which may be spbstituted will at least have the disadvantage of being comparatively empirical and arbitrary.

THE LnVxYrnw.-In consequence of the delay caused in the delivery of the large hydraulic rams it was found impossible to get them fixed and al the preparations for pushing the vessel completed till so late an hour yesterday that it was decided to defer further attempts till this morning. DQring this delay all the mooring tackle which is to drag her towards the river has been completely repaired and got into order, and Trotman'xanchors sunk to hold the chains which drag upon the stem and stern. Great things are expected from these latter when the vesel shall have advanced too far down the ways to be easily reached even by the newhydraulic machineswhich have beenfixed close alongside. Four new machinex of great power have thus been built into the timbers of the launching-ways, so that there seems not the most remote chance of any further hitch occurring to-day. His Royal Highness the Prince of Prussia yesterday afternoon paid a long vist to the yard, and minutely inspected not only the vessel, but the tremendous apparatus for moving her down to the water. He examined both with equal attention, and with evident manifestations of surprise at the colossal scale on which al connected with the Leviathan wras conducted. Mr. Branel and Mfr. Yates had the honour of conducting this ilustrous visitor over the yard and explaining the whole arrangements of the launch. Mlr. Hodges, of the Western Circuit, has been appointed Chief Justice of the Cape Colony. The selection of Mr. Hodges for this appointment has been in no degree influenced by party considerations, as Mr. Hodges has never taken any share in politica discussion. Mfr.

THrE INDIANi MUTINIBS. PESBAWTR Tne toiLowmng II 1 histOry of the proceedings of the British force in the Peeha.wrr valley during the Iudian rebellion of 1857:- On the 1. of May, 1857, the Peshawur force quarteredat yeShaWur, Nolherah, Hoti Murdan, and the frontier forts Pt the foot of the surrounding hills oompr!sed neurly 14,000 pien of all Arms, s follows, - A0azk.J-4f the Arer 24 Ighta neld uns eWere swuriD manned ead drTien by HndostAnees and the eight mo4h taln trinu Suns Thkbs the native troops moro than trebly outnumbered the uroens, having the whole of the cavalry, three-fourths Of the Infantry, and two-fifths of the artillery. 2. About the middle of May the news of the revolt of the )Utlve troops reached Peshawur, and the electrio telegraph continued to convey worse and worse tidings almost hourly. What could be more trying than the position of the military tad oivil authorities at this critical juncture ?-the enor2aous numerioal inferiority of the European troops, a large city teeming with hordes of fanatical Mahomedans, sworn Eeemies of our race and oreed, a crowded Suddur bazaar with its ruthless mob, and, worst of all, a host of robber tribes swarming on the surrontding hills thirsting for blood ancd plunder, who would assuredly join the stronger party. And what was to prevent the immense force of natives from rising suddenly and overpowering the Europeans ? It was, Indeed, a time of the greatest anxiety. The worst must be prepared for; every contingency must be taken into consIderatlon. The results prove that our leaders understood their position, and that their prudence, foresight, and good Conduct were, under the blessing of God Almighty, the sneans of our maintaining this important post, and thereby eaving the honour of the British name in Affgbanistan. 3. Not an hour was to be lost; accordingly the fort of Attcck, which commands the passage of the Indus, was grrisoned by a wing of Her Majesty's 27th Foot, pro. visioned for a siege, and its weak points strengthened. The Guides, a native local corps, the only reliable one in the valley, was sent to join the force moving on Delhi, where lt arrived in 22 marches, a distance of nearly 600 miles, one of the quickest marohes on record in Indian annals. The 3th Native Infantry, suspected of having received seditiouletters, were marched from cautonments and sent in detachs ments across the Cabal river to the frontier forts at the foot of the h3lls. Native correspondence was seized and examined. The communication with Attook was partially secured by sending the 55th Native Infantry and part of the 10th Irregular Cavalry from Nosherah, on the high road to Attock, across the Cabul river, to Hoti Murdan, now vacant by the departure of the Guides. The treasure, rmore than 27 Iaos of rupees (270,000f.), heretofore lodged in the old Residency, a building considered unsafe to inhabit, was sent into the fort, and the temptation to plunder it thus lessened in a great degree; and laly, the Residency, being a central spot, was made the head-quarters of the division and of the brigade, in order to facilitate the transaction of business, the General himself and the whole of the divisional and brigade staffresiding there. 4. These arrangements had been no sooner made than the 55th Native Infantry, on the 20th of May, mutinied, and seized the fort of Hoti Murdan, keeping their offlcers, without restraining them, under stict surveiUlance. The intelligence of this reached Peshawur on the night of the 21st of May. It was now evident that the native troops were rips for revolt; the spirit of rebelion which was raging in the North-Western Provinces had reached Peshawur, and must be met and subdued at once. In fact, it was a struggle for our existence, and upon the issue of the struggle here depended the fate of the whole of the Panjab. The effect of 8,000 or 10,000 troops in revolt marching threugh the Pun. jabmaybefaintlyimagined. They could not be pursued without cavalry, and of this arm we had not one reliable corps above UmbaUahh! Thus the rebel army, joined by the rest of the native troops at overy station, would have arrived at Delhi some 30,000 strong. In such a case could any Europeau force remaining have held out till troops arrived from home? Bat to return to Peshawur. The revolt of the 55th Native Infantry must be queled at once, to prevent the contagion from spreading. Now we must a' do or die" was the word. 5. The man for the crisis was present; the one among a thousand! With about 8,000 armed Poorbeahs in cantonments, it was impossible to detach a siDgle European to quell the mutiny at Hoti Murdan. It was determined to disarm the greater portion of the native force. Whether as a stroke of policy or for other reasons I know not, but the two Irregular Cavalry Regimaents (7th and 18th) and the 21st Regiment Native Infantry were allowed to retain their arms; On the morning of the 22d of May, before daybreak, commanding officers were summoned and a council wa held. Officers were then told of the determination of the authorities to disarm the native soldlery. Strong and touching must have been the appeals of commanding offioers for their regiments. It was, indeed, almost impossible for men who had served for years with their corps and were proud of them, who had watched their conduct in quarters and in the field, who shoulder to shoulder with their men had fought and won many a bloody fight--it was very diff6cult for these officers to realize the necessity of disarming their regiments, and great firmness was necessary to carry out the measure determined on. It is needless to add how heartily every one now coincides in and applauds the deoision and its execution. 6. It has been established boyond a doubt that a plot was laid for a simultaueous rising upon a certain day for the massacre of every European in Peshawur. At 7 a.m. on that very morning, after the council, without any sound of bugle or dram, the regiments to ' disarmed turned out under their own officers on parade, anu without a murmur laid down their arms by word of comrand. In the meantime the rest of the corps remained sunder arms in their own quarters, ready for actlon. But all passed off quietly, aud the arms were lodged in the magazine inside the fort. 7. That evening the force to subdue the 55th Native Infantry started for Hoti MIurdan. On the morning of the 24th the mutineers left the fort and retreated in sldrmishing order. A few of them, chiefly Sikhs, remained with their officers in the fort. The fugitives were dispersed, many kdlled, and more taken prisoners. About 400 escaped to the hills, where they were not at all wel received, and ali were made Mussulmans. Most of these tried to escape through Hazarah into Hindostan, but nearly all of them perished In the attempt. 8. Next, the dangerous proximity of the hostile tribes had to be provided against. Our available force for keeping theLm in check was much reduced by the disarming measure; moreover, the doubtful regiment which had been sent to the frontier was suspected of intriguing with ths hlll men and with the other regments in cantonmente. Overtures were made by the civil authorities, and these very men whom we had held in check by our native array, now din. armed, were invited to take oar service. They hesitated. A moment of fearful suspense and anxiety to the authori. ties ensued. The fate of Peshawar and of Its European in. habitants seemed to hang upon a thread. But God, who rules the wills of all men, inclined these lawless tribes to our side, and they fiocked in numbers to our standard. Their hatred was disarmed by our monoy, and our Sepoys overawed by their presence. Colonel Edwardes, C.B., Comrmissioner, whose career of fame had commenced on the frontier and at the siege of Mooltan, now called on the chief's of the country round about Mooltan and up towards Deragat, the scne of his former exploits, to send up to Peshawur levies of horse and foot, and thus show their allegiance. They willingly obeyed the oall, and came to Peshi wvur a numbers. While doing the work of rendering harmless the Sepoys, their presence preserved the peace, and sabsequently numbers of them have been sent to Delhi and elsewhere, to the number of 1,200. 1. To reinforce other posts, as well as the army before Delbi, a force of 1,600 men has been sent out of the Peshawurr Valley. This includes about 450 Europeans to garrison Attook; 250 European artillerymen, with 12 light field guns, besides the Guides. To replace such heavy draughts upon our Artllery a now battery was raised, manned and driven entirely by Europeans taken from the reserve companies of the Foot Artillery. Thus six fresh guns out of the magazine have been effielently manned. A lage number (250) of the European Iufantry have been taught artil. ler gun drilL A corps of 200 European Cavalry (Peshawur Light Horse) has been organized, and is fit for service. Thus the drain upon the Artillery ws compensated by the Infantry, a small Buropean volunteer corps (Cavaary) from the same bracb, and the deficlency thus created was filled up by the introduction of a reliable native force. 10. In the meantime nearly 3,000 Hindoetance Sepoys have been disposed of, either by execution, by imprison. met, or by summary discharge. The native population of cantonments has been oornpletely disarmed. The prisones (convicts) have been employed upon the Government works for the defenoe of Attock; and the confiscated propery of mutineers and deserters ha formed a fand able to mintain the prisoners and pay the stpulated rewards for their oapture The fort has been strengthened and provisioned, and its garrison, though small, is sur. The safety of caatoninents has been scured by defensible posts of Europeans belng stabished in diffeent paets, each furnished with a detail et ariley, Further, the disarmed corps have been marched out of their ines (barcks) into amp, so ax to be s44 tst *M yeiUawei UA no orMps, Eopen or ntIy' is ever without the presence of a European offioer, and all offioers remain with their respective corps throughout ihe night. The vacaut lines (hutb) of the dimred oorps have been levelled with the ground, and a eamon of rain will efface all trace of their existenee. ThecitysveTwed by the guns of the fort il posiUon againstIt. Two succemUl expeditions have been made against the frontier tibes of Ensofzye. Oar lone in each cae wsu oat trifing, while the effects have been most decisive, the largi vllage of Naringee being destroyed, and the frontier rebel chief killed. 1L A Land Trausport Train has been formed, by which Europeau troops cau be oonveyed long disanoes with little or no fatigue. Also sick men can be sent to Eawul PHndee, a distance of more than 100 miles, In four nights, and healthy men, if necessary, brought to replace them. In estimating the importance of the advantage derived fror the Land Transport Train, it must be considered that In this climate a maroh of 12 mUi renders the Europeau soldier unfit for further exertion from fatigue. This train hm already been of much use. 12. The artillery-park has been defended by an earth. work, rendering the gun safe from a audden rush of the rebels, by which they might have been taken and spiked when kept on the open pade ground. Besides the full reinforcemente sent to Delhi and elsewhere, with their large complement of officers, U officers have been detached from the corpa present, and sent out of the valley to aid In raidng new corps elsewhere. On offioers being clled for to erve before Delhi, Brigadier-General Cotton ordered 19 offices to start without delay and prooeed directly to join the army at Delhi; 13 of these were taken fromthe Pedhwur Valley. 13. The Bengal tiger, caged in the Peshawur Valley, may be called harmless, although half the bruWs fangs and claws remain. Abont 3,000 Hindostanee soldiers have been allowled to retain their arms, but they are counterbalanoed by 2,000 reliable native troops brought on the strength of our foroe Bdnce the month of May. 14. The following tabular statement shows the state of the Peshawur force at the beginning of the month of September, 1857, and tells a very different tale from the statement of the force on the 1st of May, 1857;- THE DECCAN. The following very interesting letter from Hyder. abad describes by what means the tranquillity of that important town has been preserved:- " Hyderabad, Deocan, Oct. 12. "As news from India is eagerly expected by all friends at home, I have thonght that you might possibly wish to hear from this place some short account of the general aspect of affairs now, and of the state of matters at this Coart since the breaking out of the rebellion. The newsof the Metrut and Delhi m cres took nearly a month to reach the city of Hyderabad; when it did arrive the result was at once observable in a distinct heaving of the masses and in attempts to excite the fanaticlsm and bigotry of the armed rabble of the place. From the first, however, the Nizam, true to the hereditary policy of his house, pronounced on the side of order, and In this decided attitude he was warmly supported by the old Shsul Oomrah, and by his intelligent Miister, Salr Singh. This determined attitude of fidelity to taties and of loyalty to the British Government called forth the indignatlon of the Moulvie and of the masss of the people, who lost no opportAunity of exoiting the feelings of those who had nothing to lose bht everything to gai by revolt and dis. turbance. Very fortunately for us the Arabs sood firm on the side of order. This is to be acunted for partly on the supposition that their servioe under the Nizan is a profitable one. They are, in faot, the Soucars of the city; they are wealthy and very avaridous, and they fore. saw that in the coming struggle, gain who might, theyshould lose. Besidesthis, the Minister paysthem regularly, andthey had,therefore, no special excuse forsidingagalnsttheGoverE. ment which behaved so well to them. At an early period the Arab Jemadars assured the Resident that they would support order, and up to this time they have faith. fuly kept their word. Besides the Arab, there are bands of armed ruffians in the city-Deccanees, Rohillas, Affghans, &o., over whom the control of the native Government has always been more or les nominal, and at one time It was impossdble to predict how far the active Minister's efforts to restrain them would be crowned with suoces. "The Moulvies almost to a mn were against us, and, while they acted upon the better clsses the rascally fakeers did all they could to excite the lower casses of the populace. I The most exaggerated accounts of our defeats and disaters reashed the city daily. The bigotry of the city was roused, and the whole tone of the native towards the European changed perceptibly. But our danger waa not confined to excitement within the walls of the city. There was also a strong suspicion that some of our native troops from Secun. derabad and from the Resident's escort had been attempting to exdte the fanatical feeling of the Hyderabad budmashes. This fact was vouched for both by Shums-ul.Oomrah and by Salar Jung, and prompt measures were at once taken by the Resident to arrest the growing mischief. Salar Jung handed up several; they were brought before a court of inquiry, and, though the evidence failed on some technical point, yet sufficient was proved to show that mischief was intended. The Resident, at a public parade, told the 7th Cavalry that suspicions were slioat regarding their loyalty. These steps, taken in conjunction with the oonduct of Sar Jung in handing up the mlschief-makers, tended much to steady the few bad men in our force, by showing them that mutiny would meet neither with countenance nor support from the city authorities. The heaving, however, continued, and matters werelooling very grave; the Minister was ruling the city with a steady and firm hand, but no one knew when or in what manner the peace would be broken; all had an impressIon that a crisis was at hand. On Friday, the 12th of June, an attempt was made in the Mesea Musjid to ralse the Jehad; the Moulvie (Akkbar Ali) was interrupted by a volea demanding the extermination of the infidels; a second voice urged the Jehad, and had it not been for the timely arrival of the Minister's Arabs the move might have been Immediate and, to us, overwhelming. 5,000 were present in the Mausi'd, and the mischief-makers managed to escape. The escort of the Residency had fortunately been increased, so that Bome resistance might have been madehadthe troops proved steady. " Placards of an inflammatory character were daily stuck up in the mosques, and Salar Jung cama in for his share of the grossest abuse. Unmoved, he tore down the plsards, placed Arab guards on all the gates and mosques, warned unruly characters, watche. suspected men, summoned Sikhs and others in whom he could trust to the city, broke up all assemblies of the people, and conducted himself with energy, wisdom, and discretion. During all this time rumours of the infidelity of our Sepoys were gaining pound in the city. The Wahabees were zealousdy at work In our camp and elsewhere, and it was suspected that our troops wonld not stand the strain much longer; but General Coffin and the indefatigable police magistrate, Captain Webb, were on the alert; fakeers were deported, suspicions characters imprisoued, newsmakers flogged, and every means were taken to prevent mischief entering our eantonments from without. The poet-office was watched, and every official became fully aware of the value of energy and care during the crisis then passing over Northern India. Friday, the 19th, being the day of another suspected rise, precautions were everywhere taken; the mosques were overawed by Arabs, and the day passed over quietly, On the 20th news of the Aurungabad mutiny reached Hyderabua Now the mischief had come clos to us. Mr. - was much disgusted with the conduct of the men in whom he had placed much trust, and we all felt that the Contingent was little to be depended upon. GeneralWoodburn marched npon Aurungabad and infiicted summary punihment upon the mutineers, but the numbers who escaped made us uneay as to the ultimate results of the mutiny. On the 25th of June we heard the news of the fall of Ddli (untrue, of course). The news was credited. in the bazaar, and the effect upon the masses of the people was very marked. We then saw that Delhi was everything; it was a nsme, a cause, a locaUlity, a something tangible to fight for. Many, even of the better classes, carcely knew Cawrnpore, Iahore, Allahabad, &c., by name, but all knew Delhi. Our defeats and suooesses elsewhere were moonshine; at Delhl they were of overwhelming imporhnoe; with Delhi we held India, without It we were conquered. In a few days the real truth was known-Delhi had not faUlen, and every native raised his head again higher than ever. Rumour of further mutinies and maacres, of further misfortunes, created Intense satisfaotion here, and evidently the heaving was beginning to look uncomfortable once more. Central India, too, was rising. On the 12th of July 13 Aurungad mutlneers were apprehended In the city, and were upon the 13th handed over to the Reeddent. The thing was not well managed by the Minieter, and the consequence was much, excitement in the city. The men were sent to Blarimn at once Whispers of an intended ridng became now dlsagrbly distinct and continued. The REident had obtained in formation of coming evil, but Saar Jung felt certain that his information wm wrong. On Friday, the 17th of July,' the escort (2 ompani ofS e&Po, 26 sowa , 200 of the 2d Kisalah, and five guns) was warned to. prepre The hour appointed fox the rising pssed over, and a note from Balir -ung) pronoucing all quie in the cit, had been reodved; when unexpct edly, at hall-peat 5 pn., rwe got Information that a band of Rohlas, hedsd by a jem and boulvie, had bust into the Begum Bazar, and were making for the esidency, calling out for the elease ofthoAuugabadpzl. soners and for the looting of th traury. We all repaired to the Reidency, ard ju as the mob attacking the garden ptes had broken down one of them, the Hore Artlery guns opened upon them at 300 yards with double charge of sniter. The effect wa magical. The smoke cleared away, and not a soul of the villain was to be seen. The greater part had beaten a retreat, and the rethad broken into a houe for shelter. The night meantlme came on, aud, though means wero taken for capturing the fellows, we found in the morning that they had dug through a wan and tesaped. The intfUtion was villanous; the executon moot impotent. They had auticipated a city move, bazur help, snd unsteadiness of our troops. In all points they were bitterly disppointed. Every one behaved well, steadly and zelousily, and we felt ourselves stronger than ever. TheMWiaterand.Nlzam did all they could to catch the ringleader, Toora BzKhan. Inthlstheysucceede, but to this day the Moulvie ia at large,ale, probably, under the protection of some influential city noble. The escort was now strengthened and the Residency fortified Our backs were up, and we were prepared to show fight. No ono of respectability in the city had any. thing to say to it, certinly the native Government had not the slightest bad in the matter. The Beg= Bazr is epated frorn the citybythekiocsy, aud Is onthe Residency side, hence the possibilty of getting upadis. turbance there Without SaLar Junges knowledge. Toora Baz Khan still live. The preparations for defenee at the Reidency alarmed the Nlzam-a timid, suspiciou mannot a little. Our friends had lnsinuated that we Intended to attak the city, and sundry pardes of the Hyderabad subsidiary force had been pointed oit to kim as prepsitive to a hostile move. He even talked of snding his family to Golconda Fort. The Lancers, too, and Sippers were coming to Secunderabad, and he was sWdentlyuneasy. Upon this the Residentwent to the Durbar on the 29th of July, and satified the Nizam fully on ths point. On that day we must have seen 30,000 or 40,000 armed men In thC city; in the then state of excitement it wAs a servli of Ao little peril. Matters now quieted down a little.- Tho Bukrees ed passed of quietly. The Aurungabad mutineer wmere tried, tansported, and removed rapidly to 'ualp&. tam. " On the 7th of August bad news of the rise of the 27th Bombay Native Inantry at Kolapore reached us. This, added to the disppointment of the mall announolng tho depai>ch of troops round the Cape, made us again uneasy; but our troops were true and steady. The bad men had been found out, and the wavering had been confirmed by the energy of the authorities. The Mohurryum w, however, aS bhnd, and we all expected a move. The izan offered 1,000 Arbs for the defence of the Residenoy. On the first day of the 3Mohurrum 260 of the 12th Iancers marched I,n Slkha were freely used; Arbs were posted by the Miniter at all the gate.A EAery plae wa watched, every bazaar patrolled, every one was on the alert, and, thanks to God's mercy, the time of trial came to an end upon the 31st of August, without the vestige of a disturbance Since then we have been more at peac Time shows that our Ma&drs troops are thoroughly trustworthy; everywbher, except in the case of the contemptible 8th Cavalry, have they behaved well, and we all hope that Government will never forget the fidelity and loyalty of the Madras Sepoy." THE CAPTURE OF THE RAJAH OiF ASSA3L The following letter describes the manner In which Captain Lowther captured the Rajih of Assam, thereby avoiding the masacre of EBuropeans in that countrype "September. "You will have head ere now of the capture of the Bajab of Assam, which your humble servnt effected as follows :_ " The Colonel sent me in hot haste with my Ghoorkas, and early the next morning we dropped down in boats towards Debrooga, reaching that station the second day, about the same time the Colonel sending to ask the other out. posts for the Ghoorkas and hUIl men, sending Hlndostaneoes to relieve them all, and thus give us a small trustworthy body of troops in case of extremities and disastes. " MY plan was to lake away the bulk of the artillery pieces from the native oompany of local gunners, with ammunition, &c., many of those men (lindostanees) having been heard to talk seditiouily in the bazaars; next, to secure our own regimental nagazine, and manage, in case of an- mt that our own men (Iifles) should be in safe possession of all accesto It; next, to shut Up al the tza. sure -a privte property in the fortified aqure in the civil station, placing a picked guArd over It; next, to size the King. who was at the bottom of the plot, surprsing him suddenly, and taking all his treasure and papers, and send. Ing him away a State prisoner towards Caloutta; next, to have a body of picked men so as to act at Instant notice. " In communication with the Politicl at Seebsaugor (vid map) I engaged to meet him on the night of the 9th at a particular mouth of the rlver below, he leaving on the night of the 8th, by boats, dropping down the stream, the dia. tance 40 miles. At length I and my riflemen ro=ded a nook, and were gLad to find the Political, with a few armed polce, all ready to meet us, my large boat taking them and canoes with the police in tow, and by the bright moonlight we dropped down softly and pleasantly to Nowghur GhAut, distance 16 miles, reaching about 11 p.m. We had some trouble In keeping clear and hiding ourselves from the observation of the large fishlng villages we had to pass, but ur good fortune took us past unnoticed, and we Landed unseen in the tall gram jungle, on the brlnk of a morass, such as only Aess contains, mosquitoes aimost darkening the moonlight; not a word allowed to be epoken, and scouts sent out to search the jungle for the elephants sent out previously for transport of men over the impassable tracts; soon found these, commenced our march; the moon became obscured and a storm of wnd and rain set in; all around us a swamp, which obliged us to lowa the elephants very lightly, and deposit ourselves occasionally on dry spots and higi patches, while the elephants went to and fSo to lift the men across the quagmires aud waters. Twice my large elephant 'sank down, Bo as to wet his ears and my feet together, and each step ws attended by the most noxious effluvia, arising from the decomposed vegetable matter at that season, while myriads of mosquitoes Swarmed around us. On an Island we met the native chief of police, our principal informer of the plot, who had been sent out as if on his duties, looking aLfter our postal arrangements of the provino. We held a council, and then all moved on quietly again. Fortunately, we had now only a mile or two of that horrible march, or man and beast must have knooked up, the wind and rain increasing. " We soon fortunately came on to a raised causeway, in pretty good repair, dry aud smooth, and I rested my men for awhile. What with broken bridges and other impedi. ments to night travelling we did not reach the Royal town till half an hour before daybreak, the sky delightfully black, and the rain a very waterspout, both which had the beneficial effeot of quieting the noisy curs which infest the purliu of every Indian locality. A final consultation Wa held in slght of the Royal den, arms examined and loaded, and Overy preparation made for the finishing blow; the stout little Ghoorkas grinning delight as they examined the sheaths of their kookeries, or wi knives, to see whether they were within grip. "We passed unnoticed along a straggling suburb, and suddenly turning a corner I was told by my guide that I stood within the Royal premises. "I told off my men rapidly, and formed them into parties, s0 as completely to surround and oover every ontlet and corner. The main party, consisting mostly of my own paticular sharpshooters and bodyguard, watohed the front another towards the town, there to arrest an educated Ben. gales, agent to the conspirators; another party moved to the rear and cut off escape towards the town; while my friend the Political erept quietly past some outhouses with his police, and under the palace walls awaited my signal for opening the baL " Before long the ominous barking of a disturbed cur in the direction of the party sent after the Prime Minister pro. climed no time was to be lost, and off I went towards the guard shed in front of the palace, my personal shapshooters following at the double. The noise, of course, awoke the leeping guard, and as they started up from their slumbers I eaught one firmly by the throat; the little Ghoorka next me felled with a butt-end blow another of them while they were getting to arms, I having strictly forbidden my nnan to fio until obliged; the remainder, as we rushed in, took to fight, and my eager party wished to fire on them, which I prevented, not considering such valiant game worth powder and shot, In the darkneas and confusion no metns of entranoe could at once be found. My police guide, how. vr, having been often in thepiiace, knew every room in it, and, thrusting himself in at a door, acted ferret to perfection, and by dint of activity soon brought me into the pro. snee of the King, who, though young in years, is old n sin; he refused to surrender or admit any one,-a resolution which cooled insanter on my calling my men to set fire to the palae, and he then with a bad gra delivared up tome his stae sword A shont from the opposite doors procaned an entry the. The Queen Mother and the rert of the female Ioyalty. and attendant3 were seized while trying to desnd on that side. Then came a chorus of shouting and ltrgging, and bawling for lights and ssistace; at last, slampbeing procued, we proceeded to euamle thf place; we wandered in-dark pasges and ells, whil I mounted a guard At evryd 400r.

The Prime Miniser was found at his house, fast asleep. In the beat of the afternoon w went to his resdenoe In the town, and by dint of keeping fans going orer u carried out a thorough mrch. We did not get as many of his papers as we w-ted, he having been told by hi orrespondents to destroy all lettors after reading them. " At eset I carried off may prsoners over te same bad ground by Whioh we had so sealthily arrived. We.were followed by about 2,000 furhrated Musaulmu4, crying, praying, and prostrating themslva to th& object of their lingering hope of rebellion (the Rajah), but we drove them off. " A mile or two out au individual suddenly appeared, and in a ouda and powerful oices chanted either a mence to us or a warning to the King. I could only catch one word, which slgnified ' down country;' hence I supect he was conveying advioc to the captive, whom I kept Well - alongside of me, with an Intimation I would. blow his head off li he attampted any trlcks or easted any' disturbance. We arrived at' 10 p.m. at Mthe ghaut whenoe we started the previous night, wey and hungry with a vengeance. I put my prLsoner on board my large boat, alongside Of my bed, and next morning I startei him off under a choice gard, with loaded arms. towards Calcutta with written instructions. Everybody in Assam was :m a fever of snsiety and excitement until the news arrTied that I had captured the leader of the con. Epiracy, and the dark and stormy night on which I Ocaried out the measure cansed many sleepless nig'hts to the expectant party of well-wishers We are not yet rid of traitors; two or three of our native offioers are deeply Implicated, as abo a native doctor and a number of Sepoys In both the Atillery Company and my Rifleg; they are well watched and waited upon by the Ghoorkas, who have proved themselves faithful to us everywhere, and ire eager to distnguish themselveg. Three days hence, we find by the papers dlscovered, was ihe appointed time for the outbreak, and of course the massacre of all the Europeans in Assam; but I fully expect that my counterplot has proved far too heavy a blow to their abominable chemes; disappointment and dligust are written legibly on their hideous faces at my sudden swoop on their mahina. tions. I cannot cease to thank God I have averted so much bloodshed." AN INDI FXCMION. We have been favoured with the following graphic account of a public execution in India - "Ahmedabad, Oct 26. "I have just retumned from the calm eyewitnealng of a eight of which not many months ago it would have sickened me even to hear. I shall never see such another, nor you ever see such an one at all; and, as all socnes have their profit, I will fix it while the detals are fresh. " You know, generally, what I am going to describe. It is the result of more than a week's continuous courtmarl, In which 18 men were sentenced to death. They sffered this morning. " I rode down at 5, and day dawned as I cantered along. I know nothing so sad as that slow drawing on of the sun. rie which Is to be the sgnal for an execution. There were many groups of natives moving towards the parade ground, whlch is four miles from the city, and every now and then al; iage wth the laape stDI lit, "When I reached the ground the bugles were only sounding, and there was little to be seen but the gallows with 10 nooses, and the mlserable prLsoners seated in a double row in front of it. I rode slowly pst them, and could aee no signs of emotion, except that one or two were very pale. "The regiment in which themutlny occurrodwas thefirst to take up its ground, opposite to the gallows. The other native regiment drew up at rlght-angles to it, and the Englsh regiments, behind the gallows, completed the third side of a square. Between them wore four guns. At the fourth sdde were drawn up five guns, pointing outward, across the flat leveL To these the sentenced men were to be bound. The ar of the square was now covered with mounted officers, a few civilians, the General, and bJs staff. "The whole 18 prisoners were marched before the native regiments, and their offenco and sentenco read in a clear voice, which reached all spectators. This over, the last terrible preparations were commenced. " The 10 mounted to their places on the drop, and stood there white and shdowvy against the pale sky, but firm and qulet, their faces hiddeu In white caps. A firing pary of 12 moved up to a spot within 20 yards of the place where I ctood, facing outwards, as the guns did, but behind them, further back into the square. The three men who were to be ihot were placed in front, and foarfuUy near them, not more than 12 paces from the muzzles of the muskets. They knelt down, their eyes were bandaged, and their hands tied. Meanwhile the doomed five had been marched to the five fatal guns They were bound by the arms to the wheels, but their legs were free, and the end. man-the only one whom I could entirely see from my place on the flankleaned his back against the muzzle, as loungers loan against a mantelpiece. "Ifixedmy eyes intently on that man, not50yards away, and In a moment the signal was given. There was a roar, and the whizzing of a bullet, far away from the firing paty ; a bank of white smoke, and a jet and shower of black fragments, sharp and clear, 'which leaped and bounded in the air; this and a fearful sound from the spectators, as if the reality so far exceeded all previous fancy that it was intolerable; then a dead stillness. " I walked sraight to the scattered and smoking floor before the guns I aume first to an arm, torn off above the elbow, the fist clnched, the bone projecting several inches, bare Then the ground sown with red grisly fragments, then a blackhaired head and the other arm still held together.

One man lay in a complete and ahattered heap, all but the arms; the legs were straddled wide apart, and the smashed body on the middle of them; the spine exposed; the head lay close by, too, Tho last body was that of a native officer, who was the arch fiend of the mutiny; he was a short man, with a cruel face, Ms head had been cut clean off, but the muscles of the neck had contracted round the throat like a fril. Ms fA was half upturned and calm, the eyes shut. I saw no expresson of pain on any of them.

CURREZiCY AND BANKING. TO THE EDITOR OF TElE TIMES. Sir,--Our difficulties have nothing to do either with the national credit, which was never higher, and Is the general refuge for timid investors, nor with the circulating medium, consisting of gold and paper representing gold, which was never sounder. The collapse began in America, where it was partly owing to an unsound state of the currency,-for the power of depositing Government securitiesis no just memure of the circulating medlum,-but much more to a vast amount of unremunerative speculations undertaken on the faith of an inflated, misapplied system of credit. This brought down, through some intermediate agency, the Glasgow and IAverpool joint-stock banks. The disease had now reached our peccant part. The business of the modern joint-stock bank is not legitimate banking. A bank takes charge of the unemployed balances of income or of trading capital. The advantage to its customers is that they are saved the risk and trouble of keeping their money, and are able to draw it out in a convenient manner. The advantage to the bank is that It has, without paying any interest, an aggregate amount derived from the accumulation of these balaoes, a portion of which only need be retained to meet current demands, and the rest may be invested to the profit of the bank in readilyavailable securities. The joint-stock bank, on the other hand, gives all but the market rate (not the Government rate) of interest, which has to be increased in times like these when money Is scarce and dear, in order to prevent the withdrawal of the balances. The great discount-houses co-operate with the jointstock banks by receiving and employing their surplus. Thls, I repeat, is not banking. It is a system of agencies for receiving capital for investmant, on the principle of the United States and Canadian Trust CompaWes and of the old Calcutta agency houses; but it is open to this serious objection, that, whereas investments must, to be secure, have a degree of permanency, the sums intrusted to the joint-stock banks and the dlscount houwes are payable almost on demand. Having themselves to give a high rate of interest for the use of the money, these institutions are obliged to keep It employed at still higher rates, and hence the support given to all kinds of speculations which would never have been undertaken unless, owing to the capital having been borrowed upon fictitious security, immunity from loss had been combined with a possibility of gain. Currency and banking are, however, to laymen what fate and free will are to divines; andthe difficulties of these really somewhat complex subjects are increased in this country to a high degree of mystification by the imbranglement arising from the union of the two under the same agency. This enabled the real offenders to persuade their innocent fellow-countrymen that their embarrassments were owing to some general cause, like a natural law, for which nobody was to blame, and to transfer the burden to the already overburdened taxpayers. Recourse was had to the national credit for an extraordinary issue of promissory notes, to be employed in loans to relieve the pressure. As this issue was in excess of the amount required at the time for the ciculating medium, it was as much an application of the national credit to the use of private individuals as if it had been made in Exchequer-bills. Those who had exercised prudence during the time of so-called prosperity, and had husbanded their means, were deprived of the just advantage to be made of their capital at a time when it was scarce and dear; prices were raised to all consumers, and debts were made payable at a reduced value to all creditors by an undue extension of the circulating medium; and a new support and en couragemnent was given to a system of false credit, which periodically ruins thousands of honest merchants and possessors of invested capital, and throws tens of thousands of Industrious workmen out of work and bread, to the great distress of their families and of many of those who have to help them by rates or charity, and to the danger of the whole community. 'What, then, is the remedy ? That the Governmaent should resume its proper function of managing the circulating medium; should pay off, out of the profits arising from that portion of it which consists of paper representing gold, the eleven millions due by the public to the Bank, and should leave the Bank of England to carry on business by means of its own private capL tal like any other bank. All confusion would then be at an end. It would no longer be supposed that the Bank of England was po2sessed of Fortunatus's purse or of the gift of legerdemain. Persons who got themselves into difficulties would hardly have the face to ask for assistance from the Government when it could obviously be given only by an advance from the Consolidated Fund, by an Issue of Exchequer-bills, or by tampering with the circulating medium, the management of which would in the case supposed be entirely dissociated from banling, with which it has really no more con. nexion than with any other business; bankers and traders of all kdnds would know that, if they exceeded their proper limits, they would reap as they had sown; and the natural guarantees would be revived for the whole clam of virtues known as foresight, moderation, frugality, &c. There is no security for a sound state of mercantile morality like the penalties which ought to follow the absenee of it. Hitherto the sin of our business class has found them out, but the punishment has been borne by others. John Bull has been their whipping-boy. I am. &c.. IMON1TARtUS. I Lonaol, ImL 2.

The tide at the time wa fast ebbing and the embmrcation of the Mainex and their baggage -havng been completed the Cuckoo proceeded to steam out into the river. The force of the current, however, carried the steamer towards the Gun-wharf, where she ran aground, and notwithstanding all the efforts of her-crew to get her off she became totally unmanageable, and settled down in the mud with her stem towards the middle of the river. In this position she remained until the tlde rose, which washed completely over her, the whole of the steamer, with the exception of a portionofherstern,beingsevers1feetunderwater. nmme. diately after. the ac"ident occurred the troops managed tc getonshoreatthe Gun-whatf, and the baggage, much of which was damaged, was removed and plaed on board the ArctM sip Resolute. Yesterday morning efforts were made to raise the Cuckoo by meant of lighters, but without suac cess, as she had sttled down deep in the maud md was filled with water. During the whole of yesterday a large number of shipwrights and labourers from the dockyard were busily engaged in clearing her and stripping away her rigging previously to another attempt being made to raise her. Several additional lighters have also been moored alongside, and every effort was to have been made to float her last night on the rising of the tide. The Marines were yesterday forwarded to Sheerness-by the Liard steamer. The Colossus, 80, scw steamer, arrived at Chatham yesterday afternoon from Sheerness in tow of the African and Lizard steamers, and wa taken into dock for the purpose of being overhauled and made ready for sea.

The funeral of the non-co= i=ii oned offi buglei, and 13 privates of the Chaitisrs de VDi. cennes, and the three private. of tli 95th :Ifantr, kMlled by the fal3ing of the gatewaytof the fort of, Vincennes on Sunday, took place i4 the oametery of the castle at 2 o'clock this aoternoon. The streets of the town were thronged with pesasns frort the neighbouring village,, who came in fo the. exPrers purpose of witnessing the ceremony. =Ihal MIg. nan, in full uniform, and attended by a numeroU,a 5ta; two General of Division seveal GGenle of Brigade, Genleral Sonnn, theCoammadant of Paris, the Governor and CosnmandWt of the forkeu, and their respective stafs, were on the spot at 12 o'clock. Deputations of theofficerSandsub-.ffoeraof the different regiment in garrison atVintennes,hiled with the relations of the dead, attended. The choir of the chapel was hung with black in the middle of the nave 18 coffins, each with the remains of a mutilated soldier, were ranged, and on the lids wereplaced the uniforms, ahakoea, and side-arms of the victimi. The bands of the 85th tegImnent and the Chasseur, stood close to the choir. The fuimerl serice oommenced a few minutes after 12, and was over at half-past 1. The prcession moved to the burialground in military order; at the head were the bands, and the funeral strain was mingled with the loDg low roll of the muffled drum and the melancholy chant of the priests. The coffin of a soldier should be borne to the grave by a soldier. Those who had perished by thbs cruel death were carried by their comrades tthe corporals by four of the same rank, anA the privates by privates. Immediately after the coffins aame Marshal Magnan, the Generals, and the commanding officers of corps; and the detachments of the regiments of the garrison and of those of the adjacent forts closed the line. The carriages of the Marshal and the other superior offioers followed at some distance. As the coffins approached they were paid the respec which in France is always given to the dead; every uan took off his hat, and stood uncovered till they passed. The processon realhed the cemetery at 2 o'clock. It was received with military honour; which were repeated when the graves were closed, and the wooden crosses planted at their heads. As a mere military spectle nothing could be more complete thah the performance of the last duties to these unfortunate men; and, owing perhaps to the peculiar circumetancesof theirdeAh, few things have been seen more soleran In Pas since the funeral of larshal Mortier and his fellow. victims, The Emperor sent yesterday 60f, to be distributed among the soldiers who were employed in recovering the dead and wounded from the ruins. They did not refuse the gift, but they at once gave it to their colonel as their contribution to raisig a monument to their comrades. The birth of a Prince presents a fair opportunity to Queen Isabella of Spain, If Her Majesty only knows how to profit by it, of trying to win backc Some part of the attachment of her people, Which she had well nigh forfeited, and of teting their remaining loyalty to her crown and dynasty. Much depends on her3elf. The hope of suecess is faint indeed, but such of the Constitutional party as have not been entirely alienated from monarchy, whatever be their rentlments towards the person of the Sovereign, may now find a motive for rallying once more round the throne and saving it from the ruin to which its occupants have so long been hurrying it. A letter of the 27th-written the day before the Queen's accouchement-gives some details of the present state of parties in that capitaL My correspondent says:- "The situation of Spain is atill extremely critical, and tie struggle is, if any-khing, aggravataed between the liberal and reactionary parties. I regret to say that the latter ac' as if they were determined to profit by the present interest. ing event to seeure their triumph. From the first day of the existence of the Cablnet tho Absolutist fraoUon, or, more properly, the Kinga Camaril, have mads the most deeperate efforts to prevent the reali2ation of the lIfBeral meaunres which, I may apin assure you, are contemplated by the Government. It is certain that, if the Qeoen is sincere in her desire to promote the interests of her people, she wiu have the cordial support of her adyirera, and theee In turn may fearlessly look to public opinion to back them. The reactionary camp is divided into two fractions, At the head of one ig the King, with his clique, and the majo. rity of the superior clergy. 'he other ha for its leader Archbishop Claret, the Qneen'c confessor, 'who abuses the influence which his position gives hib, and Is one of the most active instruments of the Court of Rome. The Arch. bishop desires that Queen Isabella shall reign Absolutely over Spain. This sort of absolutism does not content the King's Camarilla, whose o'bject is the fusion of the two branches of the Bourbons, knowing well that the return of Conct Montemolin would accelerate his accession to the throne. Each party prepares aotively for tho struggle, and fromu all I see I am persuaded that before long the country wiUl become the theatre of (to us, at least) important events. Yoa are aware how odious the QueenMother is to the Carlists, avowed and concealed. Nothing is left undone by them to prevent her retusrn to Spain. They are aware that her pre. sence would be an insuperable obstacle to their designs. Tho Government not only offers no opposition to her return, but even desires it ardently. Qaeen Isabella is also anxious for it, but sbe is obliged to reman passive rther than expose herself to an open, and perhaps scanda. Ions, rupture with her husband."

It will, perhaps, be still in the memory of your readers that in the course of the last session of the Prussian Diet a Bill was introduced for diminishing the facilities of divorce In Prussia, just about the same tuie as our own Legislature was occupied with a measure of an exactly opposite tendency. The circumstancea that brought the two Protestant Legislatures under the necessity of giving to their respectve legislation on this subject two such op. posit directions do not requireanylengthy explanation.; inthe liberalizing latitudinarian spirit of the age, whenl the Prussia general cede waspromuigated, every possLe and conceivable facility hadbeen given therein for the disruption of the matrimonial tie, while in England that tie was held to be indissoluble by law, and required in each specific case an Act of Parliament to give it validity. As was reported to you at the tine, the said Bil was tbrown out in the Prussian Diet by the opposition of the Catholics, who, while perfectly satisfiedwith thetendency of thu Bri1 as likely to diminish divorce, required that their clergy should first be consulted as to the provisions of the measure affecting the Catholio population. The rejection of this Bill, which had been very carefully prepared by the law officers of the Govern. ment, and most amply discussed in the two Houses of the Prussian Legislature, left not only all the evils unmitigated thathad accrued to social life from the baneful effects of the too great laxity of the legislation on this subject, but it also left a fruitful source of disorder in the Churoh still in full activlty,-vlz., the conscientious refusal of various clergymen to remarry persons whose former marriage at the hands of te Church had been dissolved by courts of law. This had led to repeated cofliots between the G[over;unent, repre. sented by the inister of Public WorshiD, calling upon the various clergymen 'to perform the clerical offices sanctioned by the law of the land, and the contciences of the lerg, who rofebed to be deterred from this by the superior obedience due to the law of God. As there was very little apparent probability of a measure suehr-is the abovementioned Bill paming the ieeht' :of the Dist, the King prooeededt,.ahbrtly. afterthe close of the session to make arrangements for allaying the excitement 'amongNtlb 5lergy-on tbe hubject, and by a O nets,ordn .,of June 8, 18D7, he ordered the Oberkirchenrath to issue.a circular instruction to te Aious provineial consiatories to the following effect :-That in all cases in which parties whose:fotmr niage .h4ad bheen; dissolved by courts of law, hould inace appliation. for the blessing of the. Churchon.an ewrriage about to be contracted b eithet of them, theoclergy should give notice of the same:to ths Consstoryy and, thds latter body bhould be.. required topronounce. upon tho admissibility ofa such applicatiou wcordm to the fundamental. priyhples, Cf Gbristian ,wedlock, as the same are ld- down .in theW.ord. of God. Either party, feelig himself.or herself aggrieved by the decdsion of thek Provincial Consi*tory, should be at liberty to appeal 'to the Oberkitrhenrath or Supreme Consistory., -3or one clas of cases, however, the King .proceeded to prouo4nce in limiin, as had been alreadycooatemplate ain the. Bill;-the par tywho.e adultery-hd been the grouna of -the divorce was to be refused aU pormildon to con*. tract a marriage with the ,parter :of hir, adultery. Tfis prohibition, in fact, formed part of tho general code, lax as it was in other respec_,- but it had be- come usual to obtain from the.-ing dispensations] frouzit, by meansof specloixopreseentations ;of individual cases By this new arrangement t,he. individual clergyman -was zelieved -by the. onus of declrion in each case being thrown upon the higher authorities 'in the Chur,ch,. who, in case of their deciding upon the ad. missibility of a fresh marriag, andof the clergyman' still entertaining conscientious scruple. to obeying their commands for sole'izing it, could aso take the requisite steps-for proocring thei execution. In compliance with these instructions from the Ober-kirchenrath the various Provncial Oonatories have issued circulars to the clergy of their respec-, tive provinces, which, while vanying in difforent unessential particulars, all agree il the following:All applications from persons divorced on account of adultery for the solemnnizatlon<of afresh. maariage with the partners of their guilt are to be rejected at once, w-ithout any reference to say supertior authority, and, at the same time, the King's determination to grant no dispensation, in future from theprohibition pronounced against such marriages by the G:eneral Code is to be made known. to the-applicants. In all other cases where parties divorced. apply to be married to others even including the applications of adulterous parties for a marriage with others than the partners in their guilt,, auch applications are to be 'brought by the clergyman before the Provinci Contory, accompanied by a statement of the case made by himself. Attached to this statement or report must be the judgments pronounced by the various courts through which the divorce cae has passed, and evidence that the final judgment haa been carried into execution; and, further. as the canonical law in some csues precludes a divoreed person from remarrying as long &S his former spouse remains alive and unmarried, it Is required of the clergyman that he shall forward at the same time a certificate of the burial or remarriage of the othor party tothe divorce. In the case of the application for a fresh marriage being made by the divorced person pronounced by the Courts to have been the cp able party, the clergyman is required, moreover, to send in a report as to the course 9f life observed by the applicant since his divorce, hgw he has expressed himself with reference to the wrongs committed by him against the unoffending party now divorced from him, and in what way he has evidenced his repentance for the same. To the above the clergyman Is to add the expression of his private opinion in connexion with the cdroumntances, and his superintendent (about the rank of dean), who'dellvers the repor in to the ConDstory,is at the saMe time required to accompany the whole with a memorial from himself on the subject. Of. the numerous divorced persons desirous of remarrying who have felt themselvesunable to meet allthe abovementioned requ1lenets at the hands of the clergyman, many have siuce the above instroctions adopted the expedient of 'withdra*ing from the communion of the Evangelical-Church, which they do by a formal declaration before a judicial court, then affirming themselves henceforth to belong to no recognized religious community, and proceeding in conformity thereto to get married jby civil process; after which, at the first convenient opportunity, the married couple signify their inu tention of re-entering the Church which its two members had left individually I In. consequence of this, various Consistories have reminded thqir clergy of the existence of a former order of the Oberkirchenrath of June, 1851, which requires that in all such cases (of persona who have withdrawn from the Church seeking readmission to It) special reference is to be made to the Uonsistory by the clergyman applied to, accompanied witha distinct and detailed statement of all the circumstances of the case, on the strength of which the Consistory will decide as to the readinsion of the applicants. HAM31 URG. (ruoM OUR OWN CORBrSPONvDrT.) 1TAMB URG, Nov. 30. I am sorry to say that this day has been one of the greatest gloom and despondency among the mercantile community. No less than 12 firms, most of them of high respectability aud credit, have been compelled to suspend payment; their names are positively known. Some of the first houses of the place are also spoken of as likely to, stop. The discounting of bills in a general way Is of course out of all question, as public confidence Is now so low that the result of this statej of things cannot be foreseen by any one. Messrs. Ullberg and Kramer, of whom so much has been Baid, have been obliged to stop altogether, and are not likely to resume, in consequence of which we may expect the most alarming reports from Sweden and Norway. The whole amount involved in the failures above alluded to I cannot precisely state, but it will be a great many millions of marks banco. A telegram, dated Hamburg, the 1st of December, which appears in all the Pans and Belgian papers, says:- " In one day 20 failures of important houses have been announced here and at Altona. There is a general panic. Many brokers have failed. The Bourse is in dismay. Merchandise and scrip are without any fixed quotation. No bills are discounted." ITALY. (moM o OwR OWN C ORSO Nvr.) TURIN, Nov. 29. A decree has been published giving greater facilities with reapect to passports, both to natives and to foreigners, in the Sardinisn States. The Meport to the King on which the decree is founded says that the increase, which for many years has been continual, in the number of travellers makes It desirable to render as quick and cheap as posible the formalities relating to passports. I may observe that,, even under the system which this aedree amends, there is no ountry that I am acquainted with where the foreigner is less molested about his passport, and an Ebnglishman travelling with a Foreign-office passport requires no visa from any Sardinian agent in order to enter Piedmont. The present decree exonerates Sardinians from having their passports viisgs, and renders that formality Incumbent upon foreigners only once in the year, at a uniform charge of 3f. The following is the substance of those passages of the decree which chiefly interest foreigners: Pa-ports cannot be grauted to those foreigners who have Ministeza or other agents of theLr Government resident in the Sardinian Staten To those who have not, passport, can be giveni by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or by bis delegates in the provinces, on special authorization. The concession of passports to political emigrants, reognized as such by the competent authorities, can proweed only from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the demand of the Ministor of the Interior. Perons landing at a Sardinlan port, and not remaining more than 24 hours, are exempted from via. Peasants Coming to the country for rral labour are also exempted." It is to be hoped that the day may come when the Sardinian Government may find itpossible io Fet a good example to other continental oountries by the total abolition of passports. In the meantime,' it acts wisely in renderng, the' nuliai-ce as light as possible to foreigners who certanly have, little to complain of in that respect in Piedmont. !the rapidity wFith which the journey from Paris to T:urn is now accomplisekd, the excellence of the road over Mont Cenis, and the certainty of its bein alays assble,rener tislaiy a more fA. vourite route 'with -eronkgin.ihff Itial.

RBFORATOBY SOHOOL& TO TE3 EDITO OP THE TIMS. -Sir,-I have with some surrs read TIn YouS rnlo ihe 24th and 26th of Novemuber two letters inveiRhfn agalmst Reformatory Sohools,-one from " Ix H G., anu thelother from "Prevention." There are men who wal always run Into excess, and there 6&za be exces of "0maudli~!" In soine schools. OA theotr hand; there is excess of condemnstion If thsee letters. Settlng this excess aside, it is very probable I might agree I It bth the witer. Prevention s,' Dio doubt, better than. dure, and these benevolent writers, if practically aud -ho#estly erying out the rinciples of prevention which tsey sO. strenuously maintain, are no doubt zealously and enefgetically labouring to promote . a better education, better dwellings, better laws, and better institutions Lor the honest labourin cl 'f -so, I corgratulate them on their work. I wish thmn most heartly all the! success that they can wish for themselves, for I. tnost truly agree with them that prevention is better than cure. And there are so mady excellent people of ths opinton, judging by the ziubirss of those wio nvegh against an attempt to cure, that it cmn scazoely be doubted but that they will find abundant assist. ate, both pecumiar amd person. Theirs is the bettet thing, and has the -mpathy of thousands compared witlu theunitS that take hold of the most degrAded of our peces. Su b,dmitting all thb, why they should quarrel with us h, ,are promoters of reformatories I cannot understand - thl should rather lookupon us as their coadjutors. Wliii can, be worse for the rising genoration of our tows than to Live a numiber of a6apegracoes luieng bther cMidzen Into ther bad practices t Andfor the pre'rLentioei of this 'ihat ca be better than to take the young samps out of thd way, and to train them gO As to be able to gt AA ' honest living ? At least, so thought the ood people of Aberdeen, where, seveiral years, since,fed igi schools were etablishedepeciayforthe teeturchins. These schools were supported by voluntary contributions ; aftr a time, however, the subscripilons partially fell off, anad it was thonght it would be necessary to give up one of tho schools. What was the effect? Why, the poor and honest people;of Aberdeen saId, "eThismnutnetbe;" and they set a subsoription on foot among thenselves, and ralsed 1# no time between 2001. and 00 to keep the schools goIlig. This they said thei did for the protection of their owp children. They considered, as "L. H. G." and 'Prc verition?"do, that prevention was better than cure. Now, those wito have taken up reformatories consider tbelrs to be asystem of prevention, Dot only byr klngthose who have been nurtured In wretchedne, ignorance, and cHinei, and tehing them something whereb to ean an honest living, but also that by taking away boys who are heads of gangs and leaders in crime they literally prevent otWers being led into dishonest habits. "L . G."and " Prevention" are not the firs by many who have pronheI sle4 thatplacinglcriminal boys inreformatories would induce others to commit crime In order to get there too. We jud of prophets by what follos. Wel., let us look at facts Mr. Baker, of Hardwicke-court, Gloestershize, in the p3per he read at the Birmingham mneetizngI tbr last,saido speaking of Cheltenhamn, that in thethemohsfo July to September,1856, during which the laat marked boys (ms dangerous) were apprehended, the total number of coy' vidtions was 18. In tte next c,uarter,-viz., Christmas there were six; in that ending Mirbc, there were three; in the next five; and tn the last quarter,-viz., from July to September, 1857, there was tot a single conviction. lam one of four (misguided men, if "L. H. G." and Prevention" be right) who have established a reformatory in the county of Norfolk. Here, again, false prophets arose. I was told we should induce parents to make their chUdren thieves in order to get them into our school, and that there would Eoon be an increase of juvenile delinquency. What has been the fact? Our school was certified in the summer of 1855; in the six montbs of the whiter 1855 and 1856 there r'ere 69 cases of juvensile delinquency before the Norwich magistrates. In the corresponding monthsof 1856 and 1S57 there were only 34; and not long eince the head of the city police told me his situation as to juveniles was be. come a sinecure. Since the Norfo]k sohool was certified In 1855, 49 boys have been admitted; but within the last three months there baa not been asingle application for admuisdon, andI bolieve there is not one boy under sentence to a reformatory school in any of the prisons of the county. We call this one kind of prevention, and not an unimportant one. ' L. H. G." and " Prevention" seem to think that because they have not yet succeeded in their endeavours to give every chUd a weliclad back and filled beUy, nor good shoes, nor comfortable house and bedding, that we ought to keep our bovs on the lowest scale that wil bear up human life. Inthe lTorfolk school it in a regulation that every boy shall have two pairs of shoes, a dryclean pair every day, and a nice steampipe laid on to insure their being dry. What a luxury I rn be bound that scores of thoee whom ";L H. G." and '1 Prevention"' pity (and I pity too) have not one pair to keep dry. The question may araie how can yon jtutify this luxury? Simply by the facts that it is cheaper to keep leather clean, dry, and oiled continually, and that it is leis trouble to have children's feet without chUblains. It is also to be inferred that "L, H. G." and "PrevenEion"' think that boys in a reformatory do no work. Wa have now a lot of boyis diggingan 20 inches deep, anAl they do two poles a-day. A litte time ago they were forking ground sI inches deep. The work was in strips three feet wide, and these strips were 160 yards long. The boye were to have a halfpenny for each strip. This stimulus was so reat that some of them did three strips in a-day. I 'wish "Pieventlon?' would try this. In a good workman the mind must go with the muscle, and there will ever be a gooddea offritio atther jncton,and there is no oil like "si31er;," besides everybo, especiadthore inwho have been nurtured in idleness, should feel that their labour brins I somthig wrth he avig, and by acqirin prbert thesoetlvesbe Â°itntduced toh respect the property of others. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ teprpruAt our branch reformatory there is a boy who was the worst and most daring in Norwich; he had been 16 times before the magistrates and seven times imprisoned, He is now wel clad, sufficiently fed, andis lertning to be a shoe. maker. The manager of the school told me that last Fri daS, when he required some change, this boy at once lent M &.Hw did he come by the imoney? Be has a trifle for the work he does,-about 2d. for each pair of shoes. He says he has got a chance and he means to "m make It." He does not care for play, and works almost through the entire day; what he wants is to learn his trade, and to cut his own loaf. Is it right to help this bad boy? Why not? His history is short.' His father diod, and his mother msred again. His sepfather beat the boy most cruely, till the high mettle would stand It no longer. He left his home, and having dared his fatherhe dared the world. The charges against this boy were so commonly for stealing food that he acquired the 8obriqvxt of "3Chitterlings." Ilsthere any reason why this boy should have been for ever lef b an onteast from society? "L. H. G." has, no doubt, in his labours of love amid the suffering innocent part of the poor of London, seen such cases of destitution that even the decences of ife ap ear too mucoh for him. NTo doubt he has seen very many Wami. lies without a bed at all * stiDl, from the days of LoS down. wrard, I should scarcely have thought any one would have smascatically obiected to separate beds for bovs. JORN WRIaT7R ]Judwick-house, Buxton, near Norwiech, Dec. 1. * 6f the 48 boys admited from 185 to 1857 ouu 20 have both PuBLiC PÂ§TrrxOws.-Tj1e sum of 6,70fi. has been incurred for the expense of printing and folding Ireports and appendioes and indicem to reports and appendloes on PnbubI Petitions iuring the last five yea, ending 15T7.

LAW M-BPORT. CGQURT OF CHTANCY, IWCOLl'S-nM. Dra. 2. CADDIC1K V. SKIDMMOR7. (Before tlze LORD CHANcExOn.) Mis appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor linderaley was argued a't shecommencement of last term and stood over for jcdgmvent. The object of the suit was to enforce a parole agrco ment entered into between the plaintff, a solicitor in Staffordlshire, and the defendant, a peso etpeioenced n mining transacions,, for the worieing of a mine, called the Tindle Mrine, and to obtain am account of thc partncrship profits The allega. tions of the plaintiff wvere that he bad been inInced to join in the utnderta1king on certain terms, and had subseguently been persuaded by the de. feudaut to give up his share in the concern on the representation that it 'was valuoless The defendant denied that the agreement was in the terms or to the effect set out in the plaintiff's bill, and also relied upon the Statute of Frauds as a bar to any olaim, because the agree. mqnt related to land, and ought, therefore, to have been in wrting. The Vice-Chancellor was of opinion that the evidence did not make out the agreement to be in the terms contended for by the plaintiff, and dismissed the biL From this decision the present was an appeaL The LoDD CHANCELLOR now delivered judgment, and said, it would be unnecessary to consider whether the view taken of the evidence by the Vice-Chancellor was correct, as he was clearly of opinion that the agreement was not one that could be enforced in this court, on account of its not complying with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, and th'refore the appeal must be dismissed with costs. Ri&DFIELD V. RANDFIELD] This was also an appeal from Vice-Chancellor Kinderaley, argued last term, and stood over for judgment. The bill was filed to administer the estate of William Randaeld, late of Harwicb, shipowner, and the question arose under his will, made bis own handwriting, and dated October 18, 1837. The te8tator thereby, after directing payment of his debts, &c., gave all his real estate by description to his son when he attained the age of 21, subject to an annuity and specific gifts to his widow. Then followed a gift of personalty by desoription to his son; but he added that, if the band of death should fal on his widow and son, and be left no other children or his son any iune, if he (the son) left a widow she should have an annuity out of the testator's real estate the residue to be divided equally te certain parties named, tiey paying all the teatator's sons debts, or his wife's should she be the longest liver. The son attained 21, and died, leaving a widow, and the point for the determination of the Court was what estate the son took, *nd wbat (if any) estate was given over? The Vile. Chancellor held that there was an absolute gift of the realty to the son at the age of 21, and of the personalty at the death of the testator, and that the gift over waa void for uncertainty. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Dickinson appeared for the appellants; 3Mr. Swanston and Mr. Kay for the widow; M r. Baily and Mr. Sbebbeare in support of the decree. The LORD CHANiCLLOR gavejudgment, and Â«id, he had perused the will over and over alain, and, after a rmastre consideration of its wording must say that he was unable to agree with the Vice-Chancellor'sconstruction of it. The intention of the will seemed to be that the son was to take an absolute intorest in both realty and personalty, but that that interest was liable to be divested in the event of the testator leaving no other chUd, and the son dying without ever having had a child, and then the gift over was to take effect. It was a queston of considerable diffiulty to declde who were entitled to the gift over, and tberefore all that the Court would do now was to declare that the gift over had taken effect and direct an inquiry as to the persous en. titled. Ordered accordingly.

It appeared the defendant liad a daughter, who was married to a Ma.. Davis, a hatter in Oxfordastreet. In the autumn of last year the plaintiff received an invitation to call at the defendant's hoase, which he accordingly did, and he there saw M Pehnell, who Introduced her daughter, Mr Davis, to him as Miss Pennell, and beggea to know what his terms woould be to give her instructions in muic. The plaintiff under too)c- to give the young lady lemsons for eight guinews a. quarter, and immediately commenced his duties, and gave his lessons at the defendant's house. He soon after discoverei that his pupil was married, And In a conversation which he had about the sane time with the defendant the latter ex. pressed great anxiety that his daughter should be qualified forthe stage. When the first quarer's payment bsoame due the pupl told the plaintiff that her father wished to paJ the amount, and, bavlng left the roomtofetch the money, she returned with it in her hand, and paid the plaintif eight guineas. The lessons were oontinued for; ho quarters longer, but it appeared that a few of the lesons in the first quarter were given sit DaVis house, and that after the first quarter many of 'them were given there. The defendant was extretaely anxious for his daughter to become proficient, and to tome out aa an actress, and he told the plaintiff that the yodng lady's husband had signed a deed by which he had agreed not to interfere to take the proceeds of her perforinances. The plaintiff was eolicited to introduce his pupil to the public, which he accordingly did at Southamop ton, on the first night as -a young lady," and on the Ml. lo*ing night as " Miss Rsina PennelL" From this time the young lady made several appearanoes in public, always as " 1 Miss Rosina Fennell," and, among otherplaces, at Sadler's Wells. At the Norwich and Yarmouth Theatres sbe played and sung in the Barber of &ville, Love Chase, Pelwfccewn, &t., Mr. Donald King also playing a pro. minent part The defendant accompanted the young lady to Norwich, and, in fact, had engaged the theatre a his own speculation; and, acoording to the plaintifs stxt;emebt, he had retained the plaintiff's services not only on this but on other occasions, and had omitted to pay him. The defendant admitted his liability for 201. for the Norwich entertainments, but he disputed the plaintiff's claim of 101, for his services at Sadler's Wells, as well as i6 guineas for two quarters' singin lessons, and a charge which the plaintiff made for the loan of music, The defendant was called, and denied the statements made bythe plaintiff- and his counsel relied strongly uon the fact that thougn the plaintiff ,had charged the defendant with the Norwich debt, he had sent in his account to Mrs Dapvis herself for the lessons, and had demanded payment from her in writing. The plaintiff had stated that he had addpted this course, at the saggestion of Mrs. Pennell, as the most likely mode of getting the money. lsM Pennell and her daughter, Mrs. Davis, were both in corlrt, but they were not called, Lord CArP.BnL summed np the evidence, and the jury found for the plaintiff for 361 16s JOEXS V. Gr lr. TAxton appeared for the plaintiff; the defendant did not appear, either in person, or y counsel, or attorney. The plaintiff in this action was a retail dealer in charcoal, and he sued the defendant, who was In the same way of bu4iness in a wholesale way, to recover damages for being given into custody and taken before a magistrato upon a bharge of obtaining goods by false prelences. The defendant ple2ded "Not Guilty, by statute." The plaintiff stated that he &ad entered into an arrangement by which the defendant ad undertaken to supply him with chroal from time to time, upon his giving his acceptances, to be endorsed by a --n named Howton, to cover the amount, He had thus given the defendant a bill for 12M, but that ws given up, and a 201. bill was accepted, and jest before that became due the plantiff accepted a further bil for 401 When the 20b bilL became due it was not paid, and the next day the plaintiff calling upon the defendant, the latter threatened that if the plaintiff did -not paythebiL forthwith he (the defendant) would give bimn muto custody for obtaining goods by false pretences. He was as good as his word, and sent for a policeman and rave the plaintiff in charge. The plaintiff was taken to a policestation, thence to a pollce-ofice, where he was discharged. The plaintiff gave as a, reason for aot paying the bill that it was not presented to him, and he stated that he had lodged 2017. ith his solicitor for the purpose of taking it up. T,Ord CAsPnEL,L told the jury he thought the plaintiff was enpitled to a verdict, but, underthe circumsatanoes, bisUrdsihp thought-the damages should be moderate. It did not appear that the defendant had any malice. The jury found for the plaintiff-damages 101. LEWIS V. LEVY. * r. O'Mialley, QC,, Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Laxto, appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, QC., and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine for the defendant. I The plaintiff In this action, Edward Lewls, was the manaoer of -a loan society called " The Traders and Mechanics moan Society," carried on at No. 16, Fetter-lane, but which society it appeared consisted only of the plaintifs ste a Mrs. Foster. The defendant, Joseph Moses Levy, was tha proprietor of a newspaper called the Daily Tee7pa, published in the Strand; and the presenat tion was brouglt aginst him by the plaintiff to reoover daInag. 7or several libels pubbshed in that' journal, imputing to the .$alntiffmthat he had bcen guilty of wilful and corrut 3ury The defendant pleaded, under Lord belmls Ac, ttte aricles in qurtlon were fair, corrct, aPd true le. -ports eT proceedings which had taken place in es urt of jl tice. Itappeared that-a .Mrs. Bass who wa tte o the ife of the to clek of Doer bu dio rctaed kra him by a~ decree Of the Ecclesaastical Court, had obtained a leanL from the plaintiff's eflce, and, according to the plaintiffa -5- * se, abe, together wlth an attornew's _cer], named J Fn Edward Collettk bad united to deei65e USe Pla. tiff, by representatlous to the effect that mms Bess was& wdo loy,and that In this way a sum of 30l. had been obtained fiom $he ide Th plahintiff made c hbrge against Collett, at GIdh of obtaining money by false pretenoes, and Xismr that 3r& BAs made n declaration that sbe wa a wow,. and that the defendant Collethad ofirmed te staTe. ilbiet. On this occason Mrs. Bans was examined as a witne, and deposed that she made tbe '--' * 'without her attention being tailed to that nrt which stated that she wasaw1dow; and.sbe added, thtehad told the plaintiff she was a married woman the wife of the town clerk of Dover. Upon this evidene the a dissmimed the charge against Collett, and, on the a of Colleta counsel, he granted A summons for theinti to aniswer a ebarge' f perjury. When this cbhrge cameon to be hear trs.d urepodtedtbeavidende behdgen on the previous occmion. In givng an account of thins hrlng, it the Dail Telegraph of tbe 4th of July, under tkheading "'Wilful and Corrupt Perjury, the defendant trea substance of Mrs. Bass's evidence1 but he omittg(tceve Irse Bass's crow-examinatlon,Jwhbch, it was now cont ml on the part of the plaintiff, would have entirely deeex the weight of Iber evidenoe, and so would have clea t plnaints character in the entimation of the pubL. The most material parts of this crossexaminatlon, as afterwards put in by the defendant, were thxt she (Urs. Bas) ha o various occasions obtained gooda from tradesmen, and on as mAnyas 12oooAsons, when sued, had pleaded her eoveTkr, Sh, also sated that she was living In the rsme home with Colle%ti and was often called Mrm. Coletit, but denied living with him as his wife. The report eon. eluded by tstaing that the magistrate (Hr. Rose) remanded the phintiff for further evidezncoa In a subsequtent number of the Tdegraph of the 18th of July, tbele was a repozt which stated that the plntiff ad surren3dered, in discharge of hiis zec-ognlssnoss to answer. & ebsargeof perjury; and it concludect with this pemsp,e which the plaintiff complained of as amounting to anmiput4tion that he wras guilty of the charge :-"'The magistrate dismnissed the sumionos, there not being xuffeiAent evidence to weenre a conviction." The plainti's cae wAx proved by putting in the several arteles complained of, and proving that a bill ws exposed in front of the defendans office, contaanin ong other notices to catch the eye, the following "i,lful and corrupt perjnry by the manager of i loan'Office" -Mr. JAixS submitted that it was the duty of the plairtiff to prove his cae by putting in the cross examination of 3m Bess; but Lord CA3mzBLL raled that as the plaintiff had proved the publication of criminatory matter the defendant must prove his plea. Mr. JAaIES then called Mr. Martin, the clerk to the magistrates at Gunidhall, who produced and read his notes of the evidence given by the various paties at tbeexaminations which hLd been us. at NEilhsE. read the evidence of Mrs. Bans, andthe croea-exrinolationw, as stated above, and his note made od whvt ocourredwhenthe summonsaginstthe plaintiffwa ditoissed. The latter ran thus :-That the summons wAs dismisoed because the evidence was " not likely toproduag a.cbnvictiOn." Mr. Alderman Rose wa alsomclled, and he saad he dis. mi4sed the charge because he thought " the evideno was not sufficient to lead to a conLviction." The Alderman added tbAt he had retson to believe that the witneascs had been kept out of the way. 31r. JmÂ¶S, in summing up his evidence, said it was ex. traordinary that a man should bring an action to vindicate his character, Andyetshould notdare to gointo the boxtobe cross-examined. One of the witnesses whom the Alderman hadtloughtwss keptoutof the waywas Gadem,aman inthe plaintiff' employ. The learned counsel contended thereports were fair and true accounts of whathad occmred; and s to giving all the cros. exaunnation of witnesses, if that were done, it would fill 17e Timem. At the most the plaintiff was not entitled to more than one farthlug damages. Mr. O'M.AIEy, in his reply, enlarged upon the frauds which the croeaexamination of Mra. Bas showled she had been in the habit of committing, and complained that, while all that part of her evidence which was calculated to inpute criminality to the plaintiff had b.een inserted in the report, the whole of the cross-examination, which would have destroyed its effect, had been omitted. Lord OAaBELIm, in summing up the evidence, soid the jur were the guardians of private character, and they were also the guardians of the liertvy of the press. It was of the last importance to protect the press in giving a fair ac. count of vhat pased in courts of justice; but it was at the same time of 'he last importance that that pri. vilege should not be abused, and iLt would be for the jury to say whetherthathad been the case in this ir4tanoe. The question was whether the three numbers of the Tdegrraph contained true and fair accounts of the prooeedings against the plaintiff Lewis before Mr. Alderman Rose, for if they did the defendant was entitled to a verdict. But if, on tbe contrary, the reports were not fair and bond fdt, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdct. It was imposible thit reports should be given vrbalim* that would make the privilege delusory. Except in very important cases that could not be done, but a reporter should gives faihr abridg ment of whattook place, taking care, withoupartiality, and with eaonable care and sldli, to give a true account. With respect to the irst article, on the 26th of June, the jury would say whether the heading "Wilful and corrupt perjury" meant anythin2 more than that waS the substance of the charge made. With respect to one of the articles his Lordship observedthat he thought a reporter should confine himwelf to a dry atement of what took place, without maling commenit or drawing conclusions, at least in the articIe which contained the report. It would, ovowever, be competent for a journaist to canvss the conduct of juries, and even of judges; but in a report, hls Lordship said, he never wished to see more than a dry statement of what took place in court. His Lordship said he could not approve of the style of the report, in drawing conclusions, instead of stating what took plac in court. The report in question was not in the best style, such' a was generaly found in the daily papers, in wlhb, when he had leisure to look into them, his Lordship said he found very fair and impartial accounts of proceedins, for wilch the public ought to be much indebted tothe authors of those reports. But, though the report was not In that style, the jury must still consider whether it wastrue. Having called the attention of the jury to Alderman Rose's evidence, his Lordship said I there were many cases in which he thought it better that [the parties should not be called as witnesses; but ho thought tlat in a case like the present it might be expected that the plaintiff would becalled. Bis Lordship advised the jury to compare the published reports with the notes of ev5dence taken by the magistrates' clerk, and so to decide whether the reports in aestion were fair and accurate; bat if they should find thieir verdict for the plaintiff the danages ought to be very inconsiderable. The juryretired to consider their verdict, and on their return into court found for the defendant. TIDMIA V. EuLSTOB.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, W3sTEn;mR, DEc. 2. GREENOUGH V. ECCLES AND O0RSL (SiUinga at Ni.Y Prius, bcforc Lord Chief Juettcc CocKBURN and Snwiml .Ttrfi- I Mr. Serjeaut Byles, Mr. Serjeant Parry, and Mr. Doyle were counsel for the plmintiff; the defendants, who are three brothers, severed in their pleadings, and Mr. Hugh Hill, QC., and Mr. Mellish were counsel for Alexander and Edward, and Mr. Manisty, QC., for the remaining defendant, Joseph. The action was upon two bills of exchange for 860. and 2801, reapectively. With respect to the lAtter bill the only question was as to the presentment. It axppeared by the evidence in support of a plea denying the presentment that the defendants, upon the face of the bill, were the drawers, and the plaintiff endorsee. The b1ll was addressed to a person named Cadman, at Wigan, and drawn " Pay to our order in London " The plaintiff proved presentment to one of the defendants at Wigan on the day the bill became due, and that it was also presented subsequently at Barclay and Co.'s, in London, but it appeared that the presentation in London was too late. Upon this evidence it was objected for the defendants that as between the endorsee and drawer It wa esential tbat a bill drawn as described should be presented in Lon. don, and Mr. Serjeant Byles, for the plaintiff, admitted that although a matter strictissnmijur-e, the objecton was good. The main controversy was as to the bill for S60. It appeared that the plaintiffhad been in the habit of discountingbills for four or five years through a person named Tilly, an estate agent in Lodge-street, Ltverpool. The plaintiff had until lately been a coalowner, and bad ba d various trantactions with Cadian, in which the names of the defendants were involved. The defendants were until lately minbers of the firm of Joseph Eclies and Co., cotton brokers. The billin cuestion purportedto be drawn by the firm, and Cadman beng indebted at the time to the plain. tiff to the amount of 1,900I , apIled to the plintiff to discount it. At first the plainW refuged, but upon the entreaty of Cadman consented to discount the bill upon oon. dition that he should hand over to Cadman 3001, and place the residue to Cadmanla credit in account, which was done. On the part of the defendants Alexander and Edward, 3wa0 w paid into court, and the defence ws that Joseph ccles had become connected with Cadman in speculations, and in an evil hour bad commenced using the name of tho firm upon negotiable instruments without authority. In eupport of this defence Alexander Eccles was called, and it appeared from his evidence that the discovery of the conduct of Joseph with regard to negotiable instirments and the improper use of the name of the firm led to the dissolution of it on the 1st of July last. M5r. Cadman was then called, who, it appeared, had become bankrupt, but his evidence corroborated that of the plaintif and some discussiontook place s to whetherhe might be regarded as an "adverse FwitnesEs within the meaning of the 22d section of the Common Law Procedure Act, and whether evidence might be called to contradict The LoRD C=F.T JuST:r[ said, he was personally answer able for the clause in question, but not for the framing of it. Me thought there was nothing in the evidence to show that the witness could be contradicted as " dverso"-the term messing. according to its sense before the Act, " adverse i mind and disposition." The jury founud a verdict for the plaintiff for 560?., there being no case for the plaintiff a to the 280l. bill, and none for the defendant as to the bill for 8601. GORTENOUG1 V. RASTHAN.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER, WEDNDAY. DXC. 2. ROWLAND V. PRINCE. (&qitngs at Afi,t Prius, bcjore the CiuF' BAox.) Mr. l5erjeant Parry and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for tbe plaintiff; Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Murray appeared for the defendant. This was an action against the defendant as the acoeptor of a bill for 351., at two months, drawn by Harry Prince, his brother, and endorsed to the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded that he had had no consideration for the acceptance, and that the bill had been delivered to the plaintiff by his brother, the drawer, on the special condition and vnder. standing that it was to be returned if another bill for 551 could not be withdrawn, and that in breach of that con. dition the bill in question had been put into clrculAtion by The s, which was part-heard yesterday, was supported on both sides by the following testimony, which we prefer to allow to speak for Itself. Mr. Rowland.-I am the pliLntiff, and reside in Albanystreet, Regent's Park. I know Harry Prince slightly. He represented himeelf to be a gentleman when he applied to me in June last to cash a bill for hin for 551. I ap lied to Mr. Dalby to discount it, and received 11O0. from him, of which I gave Mr. Prince 481. lOs. in alL He afterwards asked mue to do another hill for 351 1 applied to a Mr. Wilson, who lent me 81. 1S5. on it, and I gave it to Prince. As Wilson could not advance the rest, I got 101. from Mr. Dalby to redeem the bill and I paid off Mr. Wilson. Dalby then made up the balance to 301., charging 51. for the loan. When the bil for 551. was due it was taken up Both bills were drawn by Harry Prince on his brother, the defendant in this action, at two months, and accepted by bim. The 351. was not paid at maturity. I sent notiee to the defendant at Southampton and to Harry Prince at Brighton, but the letter came back through the Dead Letter-offiee. In fact, AIr. Harry Prince was not to be found when he was wanted. Cross-examlned.-I eold him a chain once for lOs., hot 51. I have been a gentleman's valet in the first families in the land, and have since thst lived by honest work. I am a commission agent. I have visited billiard rooms, but never was a professed marker. I never kept a casino. I am 45, and Harry Prince is 24 years of age. The witness was then cross-examined at great length as to the circumstances alleged in the plea, to which he gave a distinct negative, and which are set forth in Harry Prince's evidence. Re-exaamined.-I have paid 274 lOs. to Harry Princoe on aoount of this bilL He said he wanted the chain for a lady, and I let him have it. The papr handed back, and which he tore up, was an "I O U" for 101. I did not say it was the bill. Mr. Dalby, the owner of the celebrated " Carminative," which Serjeant Parry desen1,ed, amid general laughtor, as " some stuff to polish up old ladies and gentlemen," confirmed the statement of the plaintiff as far as he was concerned, as did Mr. Wilson, who was also called by the plaintiff. On the part of the defendant the following evidence was then iven William Prince.-! am the defendant, and the brother of Harry Prince. I am the manager of a batsiness at Southamzpton. I am 30 and my brotheris 24. I accepted the bill for 55., and that for 35., by way of accommodation for him, and never received any part of the proceeds. I have paid, or caused the former one to be paid, as I did not wish to publish the matter. Croes-examined.-I have only accepted three bills for my brother. My father Is a clergyman. My brother has neyer been brought up to any business or profession, and lives on what his father and friends allow him. I have given him 301. or 401. this last year myseUf. is father allowed him nearly enough to keep him, I should say. My brother was not on the turf, though he may hav6 backed a horse occasionally. Harry Prince.-I am the brother of the defendant, and am just pa 24 years of age. I never represented myself to be 19. I have not been brought up to any profession or busnees, but my friends alvays allowed me enough to keep myself in a respectable position. On the 5th of June I wrote to the plaintiff, mx erstnding that he had means to discount hills for gentlemen of the west-end. I subsequently saw him, aud told him I w anted 501. I agreed to draw a bill for 65 to cover the interest. The plaintiff told me Mfr. Wilson would discount it. I had arranged with my brother for his acceptance. I gave the bill to the plaintiff, with 21. lOs. for his trouble. He said he would call next merning with the 501. but he never did [so. He afterwards told me he had had a great deal of trouble about the money, and that I must take 91. for 101. I met him afterwards at an eatinghouse, where he kept me waiting while he pro. fessed to go to Wilson for the money. I received from the plaintiff 251. in various small sums, from each of which a deduction was made by the plaintiff for his trouble, and his luncheon and omnibus fare, amounting to 41 10s. As I could not get any more money, I gave plaintiff another bill for 351. to cover those advances, on the understanding that be was to return the first bUIl for 551. He took the second biUlaway, and on his return said he had left it with Mr. Wilson for his consideration. He then gave me a sum of about 101., which he said he had coUected for Wilson. I afterwards asked him to give me back the 351. bill and the balance on the 551. bill, when he told me the 101. was on account of the second bUIl. I insisted on returning the money and having back the second biUL I met the plaintift afterwards near the Colosseum with a friend. lHe gave me a piece of paper which he represented to bo the 351 bil, which he tore up saying, " There's your bill." Itore it up further and threw the pieces away, believing they were the bilL We then went into a publichouse, where I paid the plaintiff back the 101., and gave hius 11. as a reward for going to get the balance on the first bUI next day. I never got any more, and just before the bill became due I went to the plaintiff and offered to give him 351. as all that was due on it. He said he wvould have it alL because of a quarrel about turf matters. When the bill became due my brother would not hear of any litigation, and we paMi the whole bill. The next thing I heard of the plaintiff was that my brother had been served with a writ at his suit for the 351. bil!. I went to the plaintiff, and be said it was of no consequence, and arose out of ak mistake no doubt, but he afterwards brought another action against me as the drawer. (This action also stood for trial to-day). The plaintiff told me once, when I askled for the money, it was uunal for gentlemen raising money through an agent t take part of the money in goode, and he pressed me to bay something of hinm-a whip and a fishing-red were mentlored. I dlid bay this chain of him for 51. accordingly. Cross-examined.--I have specula.ted in timber ohee or twice to a small extent, I leEt school at 18. I havQ been doing nothing since to gain a living. I have been looking cutter a Government situation, I have an auncle dn the i c:o almy. He is a geueral officer. I suppose I got tbrough about HOL this last ear. That was more than I ever had spent befors. I never discounted a bi31 before the first I did with the plaintiff, and I never betted on the turf btfore the end of spring. I did not keep a book, though I kept memo?andd Of the horses I baoked of coure I can play at billiayds but very little, and I never touched a card. My father allows me 3001. or 4001. a-year, just as I want it, and my friends make up the rest. When the trialwas resume4 at this stage this morning other vwitnesses were called, who corroborated the statement of the last witness as to the proceedings near the Colosseum and the interview with the plaintiff afterwards at the publiehouse, vhen the 104 was repaid. When thia evidence was given, which closed the defendant's case Mr. BiDLESTO-N rose to sum it up, bat he was stopped by the jury, who stated that they had made up their miads to find in favour of the defendant. Upon this Mr. PTERnSDORr, after making aa ineffectual struggle, submitted to be nonsuited in this action, and withdrew the record in that against Mr. Barry Prince.

kWIN2ER ASSIZES. HOME CIRCtll'. tM DSTONR. Dun. 2. 'lhe commission for the county of Sent was opened in this town on Tuesday by Mr. Justice Willes. The usual preliminary fornalities having been gone through his Lordship ascertained that no gaol calendar had been printed, and that consequently he had none of the usual information regardingthe state of the business, This, it appears, aroae in eonanence of there being some dispute between the High Sherur and the county justices as to the party liable to pay for the pnting of the usual gaol calendars, and the conse. quence as been that at the last quarter sessions there iwere no calendars printed. It is of course very essential to the administration of justice and to facilitate the proceedings that a gaol cadendar should be published, and r. Justice Willes very soon put an end to the difficulty, so far as these asizes are concerned, by giving an intimation that unless a gaol calendar was speedily furnished he should impose such a fine upon the High Sberiff as would tend to remedy the inconvenience in future. Thisbad the desired effect, and today calendars were published as usual, but still, as it would a pear, ve] sparingly, as the gaoler stated that he wasuuae to supply the representatives of the press with a ooy. There are. it appears, 21prisoners for trial, but the majority of the cass axe of tbe ordinary charaoter. Peter Whitelow, 57,was indicted for sacrilogiously breakfng and entering the church of St. Mary, at Chatham, and stealing two Burplices and other articles, the property of Robert Fauldrey Wheeler and others. Mr. F. J. Smith prosecuted. Edwin Chapman, the sexton of St. Mary's church, Chathbam deposed that on the 13th of October, in consequence or information he received, he went to the church, and proceeded to the vestry-room. He found the door open, and upon going in he saw a fire burning in the grate. Upon furtber search he discoveredtbat two surplices were missing, and that a number of forms had been torn out of the book of blank certificates of marriages. The covers of books which had contained the baptism, marriage, and bural services in common use were aso missing. He subsequently discovered that none of the outer doors of the church had been unlooked or opened, but about 12 panes of bed-.lght windows at the west end of the church over the christening pew were broken out, and the middle iron bar of the same window was forced up. The breaking appeared to have been from the outside. U;pon going into the sligers' pew in the gallery h found the prisoner concealed under the seat with the cushions over hhm. He asked the prisorerwherethe spUces 'were, and who was with him, and he made no answer, and witness gave him into custody. As they were going to the police-station he observed that the prisoner was wearing the murplices under his clothes, and they were tekeu from his person after he arrived at the station. The prisoner was an entire stranger to him. There had been no fire in the vestryrooml for many months before, and from the appearance of the ashes in the grate it seemed to have been fed with paper, and it must have been burning for some time, as the place was quite warm. Richard Hlse, a police sergeant at Chatham, deposed that he searched the prisoner, and found in his possession three glasses of an inkstand, a comb, and three dozen marriage certificate forms, that had been torn out of the book in the vestryroom. He observed to the prisoner, " I see you have had a fire in the church," and he replied, "Yes; it was dark when I got in; I unlocked the door and came out and got some lucifers of some Medlcal Staff men who were passing, and went in again, lit the fire, and lay down and had a good sleep." The prisoner had no shirt on, but two hassocks were taken from his person. The prisoner afterwards told him that he had served in the navy, and had been to the Crimea, and said that wbon he awoke from his sleep he heard the men at work ontside the church, and went up into the singers' pew to hide himself intending to stop there until the workmen had gone to breakfast. The following extraordinary statement made by the prisoner before the magistrate was then put in:- "All the evidence is pretty near my own words - they have told the truth. The sqnares were common lattice, lifted up, and broken. I had been to a sort of free-and-easy in Brompton wlth some Bappers whom I knew at Sebag. topol, end they were going to Iodia yesterday. Ilhad a drop of drink extra. About 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning I got to the military road, and stepped at a night house. I returned towards the barracks and saw the iron-gatoway of St. carys church open. I went into the grameyard and looked to see if the men had left a water bottle, -s I was thirsty. I looked in at the window and saw a christening font. I broke a square and tried to open the window, buo- could not, I lifted it up, afraid of breaking the glaes. I saw a stone and a piece of wo6d so I 'prized' them, and made it large enough for my bodytto get in. Istuckfastforhalfanhour. I madesure thete wag water by the font. When I got inside I found no water. I saw the fire ready laid in tbe vestry, and some of the books alongside the fireplace, as if they were used for waste piper. I went out and got some lucifers and came in and litlthe-fire. Then I saw a surplie, and I took my old shirt off and put it In the fire and burnt it. I raised the surplice and iut it on Instead of mv shirt. Just as I was going another sauplice stared me. i tbe faee, and I could not get ovei that, but was obliged topul my jacket offagain and to pi~ that When the prisoner was called upon for his defenoe he said he was drunk-at thetfime, and he suppoEed She Devil bad tempted himto do.what he did. The jury found the prisoner GuiUy, and he was Eentenced to 12 monihs' hard labour.
NORTHERfr CIRCUIT. LIVERPOOL. Dxc. 2. CROWNr COURT..-(Before Mr. JuSttce WIGHTMAa.) James Graham, Sydner Howarth, and Edward Bradshaw were charged with assaulting and robbing George Pearson. Mr. Milne appeared for the prosecution. Mr. Simon defended the prisoner Bradshaw. The other prisoners were undefended. It appeared that on the 21st of August last tbeprosecutor, wbo is a farmer, was returning home from a cattle-fair at Great Harwood. The prosecutor said that five men came behind him and held him by the the throat and robbed him, and then ran away. He saw the three prisonersastheyran away, and now swore that they were three of the men who attacked and robbed him. He had told the police that he should not be able to Identify them. A witness, a brick. maker, aid he was in his brickfield on the day in question, and that he had seen the prisoners coming from the direction of Holt-farm, where the prosecutor resided, and near where the robbery took place. His LORDSIIP summed np, and the Jury returned a verdict of Guilty against all the prisoners.

IIDDLES2rX SESSIONS, Wednesday, Dec. 2. (Before Mr. BLiss, Q.) Joee Maria De Lars, a young Spaniard, was indicted for stealing 60 sovereigns, several bank.notes, and some foreign coins, the money and property of Francisco Sang. The prosecutor stated that he was the commander of the Peravian frigate Amazonas, lying at Blackwall, but since tne 21st of September be had been living at No. 40, Conduitstreet. The prisoner was purser's servant on board the ship, and occasionally aisted at the house where witnes lived. On the 19th of October witness placed in his desk 454 in bank-notes (two 104 and five 5U), 60 sovereigns, 12 halt. sovereigns, and some foreign eoins, and locked it. The deek was in his bedroom. On the evening of the samae da he wenttothedesk,butthe key would not open it, and.he sent for a constable. When the desk was forced open itwas foand that the notes and money had been abstracted. Walker, 15 C, deposed that on the 19th of October, from information he had received, he went to Sidney-street, Whitechapel, and apprehended the prisoner. He ptodnoed 49 sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 23 foreign colns, wnich he received from Diego Ihendoza. The last-named person, a seaman belonging to the Amazonas, said he saw the prisoner and anotherlad counting over a quantit of gold, which he took from them and gave to the constable. Emmanuel Sevillano, cabin-boy, proved that on the da of the robbery the prisoner was in the captain's Z rooma In summing up, The learned JUDGo said he had experienced tome diffi culty in getting out the facts of the case, no counsel being instrmoted for the prosecution, but he had made It somewhat clear at last. He wished it was the rule In this cow ty, as it was in those other counties with which he was acquanted, to have counsel for the prosecution in every case; it saved theCourt a great deal of trouble, tended very much to the proper and efficient administration of justice, and mith respect to coat, was trivial and paltry mn coin parison with the advantages to be derived frm such ak The prisonerwasfound Gfuily, and sentencedit eight months' hardlabour. William Jones, alu Davis, &c., was indicted for stealin| a bali-cock, the property of Frederick Hatton, and a bF I coc; the pro ertyof another person, the same being fixed to Mr. Iangford was couisel for the prosecution. It appeared that the prisoner had been in the habit of going about to housee representing that he had been sent by the water company to see that the ball-cocks of the cisterns were in proper order. Having thus got access to the cistern, he would say that the ball-coock was out of order, and take It away, converting it into what it would fetch at the nearest marine store-dealer'. There were mally similar cases against him. The jury found him Guilty, and former convictions were proved aainst himb On his last trial he was sentenced by this Court to one year's hard labour. All his offences were of the same de8cription-stealing fixtures. MIr. Buss sentenced him to three years' penal servitude, observing that it was quite time the public were protected from his systematic depredations. ary Ann Ryan was indicted for stealing two iron instru ments, the property of John Warren. The prosecutor was a turnoock, and the propery the prisoner was charged with stealing were the key and lever with which he turned ihe water-mains. He left them in the treet for a abort time, and the prisoner ran off with them and tried to make a sale at a marine store-shop, but the dealer refused to purchase them and the prisoner ran away, pursued by the marInerstore.man, who captured her. He gave her in charge on supicion, and the artioles were soon after claimed by the prosecutor. Guilty,-Tbree months' hard labour. Ma Ann Ballen, 28, was indicted for having stolen a brooch, a wateb, and a portemonnaie, value together 301, the property of Maria Magaret Dennys, in a dwelling- Mfr. Sleigh and Mr. F. H. Lewis appeared for the prosecu. tion; Mr. Ribton for the prisoner. The circomstances of this case, which was tried on Tuesday and lasted until a late hour, were pculiar and interesting. In Januay last the prisoner entered the service of the Rev. Mr. Owen, of Carlton-vllas east, and remained until the U1th of May. In Mach the prosecutrix, a daughter of Sir George Dennys, was on a Vibit to Mrs. Owen, and during her stay she lost a mosaio brooch, set in gold and of peculiar dedign. In the centre were two Neapolitan figures, a dog and a representation of a man with a cockea-ha. She also missed a pencii-case and a a portemonnaie, and on the 20th of that month her gold watch, which in the mornng she had left hanging at the head of her bhd. On that day the prosecutrix rent to Brompton, and during her absence tie prisoner said to Mrs. Owen, "I should not wonder if Miss Dennys loses her watch while she is out, as when she went out I saw it hanging loosely by her side." Mrs. Owen asked why she did not tell hfiss Dennys, to which the prisoner replied, " that it was no business of here." When Miss Dennys returned this was told to her, when she declared that she had not taken her watch with her ht al, but had left it in her bedroom, because, as sbe had to ride toBrompton, in an omnibus, she would not take it, having once been very nearly robbed of it in one of those vehicles. The watch Was missing. In July the prisoner went into the service of Mrs. Gregory, of Hendon, and that lady noticed in her possession a watch and brooch scarcely befitting a servant girl, and asked her where she got them from. The prisoner said her sweetbeart gave her the watch, and an oldwomannamed Windsor, living at Yeovil, where she camefrom, the bro ch. Mirs. Gregory, suspecting something wrong, made a sketch of the brooch, ana took the number of the watch. Subsequently a communication was made to Mrs. Owen, and the brooch was identified by the sketch and the description given of the figures upon it as that lost by Miss Dennys and the number of the watch was the number of Mis Dennys's, which she bought at Cheltenham in 1849. The prisoner was afterwards taken into custody at a house in Acre-lane, Brixton, where she was then in service, and in her possession was found a portemonnaie, which Milss Dennys identified as hers, and she was charged with stealing that and the watch and brooch, the description of those seen in her possession exactly corresponding with those lost by the prosecutrix, but they had not been traced, and the prisoner gave no account of what had become of the watch and brooch she had. Mr. RnToy made an able and energetic address to the jury, entreating them not to convict the prisoner upon the mere coincidence of two descriptions of articles which were not produced. The portemonnsie, he submitted, was out of the question, as there 'were hundreds of thousands exactly like it to be purchased in the metropolis. The jury found the prisoner ZVot Guilty. Edward WillesEnight, 37, was indicted for having stolen abill of exchange for MS three letters, and a mat of the value of 6s., the property of George Henry Shepberd. Mr. Lau%ford appeared for the prosecution, Mr. F. H. Lewis for tne prisoner. The prosecutor stated that he lived at 13, Norfolk-square, and had been a grocery merchant and a dealer in colonial produce. The prisoner's wife was in his service as housekeeper, and be (prisoner) called at his honse one day and took about 70 duplicates, upon which he had advanced about 81. to the wife. a mat, three letters, and an overdue bill of exchange for 6. On a subsequent day he called and was ushered into the study, when he asked prisoner's wife ia his presence what had become of the missing articles. The prisoner said he need not ask about them, he had got them, and for 101. he would give thein up and suppress a charge of adultery which he could prefer against them upon the evidence of the letters. He ordered him out of the house, and subsequently this charge was preferred, In cross-examination he said, he took the house 13, Norfolk-square on t'o 29th of September, not by false pre. neuces. He gave references. Be bad been a grocer's assistant, ut was nothing but a gentleman now, living upon what ho had acquired by industry in his call of life. (EHe was very young in appearance.) Acceptances of his to the amount of 3501. were out,'and not yet due. They were held by a lady, young or old he would not say, and were for tashmneres which had belonged to the Eing of Oude. He ob. jected and declined to say where he bought the furniture in his house, but denied that two cartloads of it had come from the prisoner's when the wife of the latter went into his service. He paid the prisoner's wife 1001. a-year board wages; sometimes he took breakfast or tea with her. That was at his expense. He had now no ostensible employment, but lived on his means honestly acquired, not by his wits. The prisoner was sOnt to gaol for assaulting his wife, and while he was there she came to live with him as house. keeper. Her name was Lydia Almore Knight. Did not addresshis housekeeper as "my dearest Lydia." (The letters shown him.) Those letters were never sent to the prisoner's wife, they were never out of his possession. They contained the words " my dearest Lydia," but they were intended to apply to another Lydia-not prisoner's wife-one to whom he hoped soon to be married. He styled her " Lydia Shepherd" in one of the letters in anticipation of the event which.was to gtve her that name-in fact he was, like mosb men were at some period of their lives, in love. (Much laughter.) He did not send the letter to-the person they were meantfor, as he reconsidered their contents, and thought " under the circu7mstances" that what vas-written on pasper might be used -somoe day against him in a court of ustlce if he altered his feelings, so he wrote in their stead letters of a more soher and less affectionate nature.

PazrIcE. MAI!sONHOIYs-Willhm Brodie, a respectably.dreswd man, of about 30 years of age, was brought before theLoRD MAO,upon remand, charged with having stolen a preat.~ cat belonging to Mr. J. N. Jones, a warehouseman, in Newington, Buttts. At the previous examination the pzosecutor said that on Saturday snorning lAst he entered the News-rooms in Cheap. aide, and placed his greatcoat over one of the settle,. While reading a newspaper he saw the pn'soner hastilyeieave his seat and take up hi (prosecutor's) coat, and me0 towards the door. Prosecutor called out to him, " Where ale you going to take that coat?" Upon which the prisosier returned, and, in a state of excitement, sad he had pade a btake oand taken It for his own. He was then given into custody. Mr. Hobler, the solicitor, yesterday attended for the prsner, and said hie had beenL givent nestna h wfe of the latter that hle really b ad left home on the mpornin in question with his greatcoat over his arm. Tae LoRD MAYOR sid, he thought that not much re liance could be placed upon the evidenoce of a wife under such circumstances, and he did not see the necssity of puting any questions to her. In answer to the LonD MAYon, Sergeant White, polioe-constable 3, said he had been able to lean but very little respecting the prisoner's character. He had only been in his present lodgings a fo4znight. L Mr. Hobler.-My instirctions are that the prisoner is a --4ery respectable young man and bear an' excellent Â¢hActer, to which a gentlemax has been requested to attend and speak. Unfortunately, however, he was not present, The prisoner's wife, a decently-dreesed, good-loolkng young woman, here entered the witness-box, and, in reply to the LoRD MAYOR, mid she had been married sinoe1863, and lived in Salisbury-street, Strand. Herhusbaud did not live with her. She had formerly held a ituatlon in one of the waiting-rooms of the Great Western Railway, her husband during the time working wherever he could find employment. She left her situation about 13 weeks ago, and came to London to her preeent address, believing her husband. to be living at the Panklibanon Ironworks, in Baker. street. Although he did not live with her, she had been for some weeks past in the habit of seeing him almost every day. The last time she saw him before now was on SaturdaT morning last, when, as far as she could recollect, he qmtted her, taking with him his greatcoat. The LORD MAYoR.-I cannot understand how it is that he has only been in his present lodgings a fortnight, accoraing tothe sttementoftheconstable. Howcomes he&tobe living apart from you?

The LoBD MAYoR.-Where is that young woman ? White.-She is now in court, my Lord. The LORD MAYOR desired her to stand forward, and a good.looking girL of about 18 years of age, stepped Into the box and stood next the prisoner's wife. The LoRtD AYoR.-What relation are you to the prisoner ? GirL-None at all; but I ought to be. The IoRD MAYoR.-YOu are not his wife? Girl.-No. rve been living with him. He has seduced me after making me repeated promises of marriage. We have been a fortnight together at our preaent lodgings. He told me he wAs not a married man. (Here the girl commenced crying bitterly and fainted.) The Lord MAyoR.-Prlsoner, we now understand' your reason for having a second lodging. You have deceived your wife; you have seduoed this other poor girl, and ruined her prospects for life. That is the greatest crime a man can commit. WLfe.-I don't think he has ruined her, my Lord.

Wife (sobbing).-Oh ! pray, my Lord, for my sake, don't do that. The LORD MAYoR.-It Is my duty to commit him, and I am only befriendingyou in doing so.

He informed Mr. HENRY that her Ladyship had received a number of letters from persons in whose service the prisoner had been, and it appeared that she had always bome a good character for honesy and sobriety, but not being a tidy laundress shehad in each instance discharged on that ground. It was true that she had been In the service of the Hon. Mrs Arundel, and she had lost that situation from the same calse. Under these circumstances, and especially pa the rsoner wvas a married woman, with several children, and eng unable to write or read had no doubt been led into the commission of the offence.

MO-YBY-MABK-ETandOITYI.N.TBLLIGBNoE. Wcdnesd6y Evening. The funds opened this morniug at a further re. action of an eighth, but, although some additional mercantile failures were announced, the market ultimately assumed a firm appearance. Caorso1s for money, which left off yesterday at 91 to j, were first quoted 90k to 91. They then ranged during the greater part of the day between 90i and 91i, and late In the afternoon they advanced to 91i to #, which was the final price. For the 8th of January the lst tansactions were at 92i, or 90g ex dividend. The arrival of the Orinoco West India steamer with about 300,0001., chiefly in silver, was a principal cause of the ultimate advance. There was a large sale of stock In the morning, and subsequently a purchase of about equal rnagnitude. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 90k to #; New Three per Cents,, 90k to #; India Stock, 217 to 220; India Bonds, S3s. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the Stock-Exchange money Was still in demand at 6 per cent. for short loans, and fully 9 per cent, from account to account. At the Bank of England also the applications were considerable. An unusually large business has been transated in foreign stocks, generally at former prices. Turklsh fluctuated during the day, and finally left off I per cent. higher than yesterday. Mexican were in demand from the announcement of the transmission of $12,000 towards the dividend fund, hopes being entertained that It is the precursor to larger wrivals. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99j and J ; ditto, 1829 and 1839, 96k and 97k; ditto Four-and-a-Half perCents.,9 4; Buenos Ayres, 85; Chilian Six per Cents., 102k and 101I ; Danish Three per Cents., 83k and 84; Mexican, for the account, 19; Rusian Five per Cents., 106k and 105k; Sardinfan, 86i; Spanish NewDeferred, 2.5; ditto Certificates, 5i; Turkish Six per Cents., 91i; for the account, 91k, i, 92, 91g, and 92i; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98X ; for the account, 99i and 99; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 96i. In the corn-market this morning there was no alteration from the ratea of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cent. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 30c. for money and 67f. 65c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing a recovery of nearly a quarter per cent. About 25,0001. of gold of various descriptions was taken to the Bank to-day. The suspension has been announced of Messrs. Mendes Da Costa and Co., an old established firm in the West India trade. Their lialilities are estimated at 350,0001., and the prospects of liquidation will be partly contingent upou the realization of produce and the collections from acceptances of other suspended houses. Annexed is the circular issued :- " 6, Finsbury-chambers, London-wall, Dec. 2 "It is with extreme regret we have to inform you that, in consequence of the large amount for which we are liable upon blls that we have discounted sard hold on various firms who have recently faUen, and also from the arnouncemeat of the fallure of some of our West India and other correspondents, we are compelled to suspend our pay. ments. " We have requested Messrs. J. E. Coleman and Co., the accountants, to place a statement of our affairs before you, and they have arranged so to do at a meeting to be convened on Tuesday, the 15th inst., at the Guildhall Coffee-house, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon punctuaUy, at which we have respectfully to request your attendance ; and in the meanw time we shall do all in our power to facilitate measures which we think desirable for the protoetion of the interests of our creditors, and are "Your obedient servants, " MENDES DA COSTA Am CO." The failure has been announced also of Messrs. Kieser and Co., a German mercantile house, with liabilities for aboub 50,0001. Their circular is as follows "22, BiUiter-atreet, Dec. 2. "It is with the deepest regret we have to inform you that, in consequence of the failare of our correspondents abroad, we are under the necessity of suspending payment. " We have placed our books in the hands of Mr. G. H. Jay, of Old Jewry-cbambers, who wiU prepare a statement of our affairs, which sha be submitted to our creditors on the earliest possible day. " Trusting to recelve in the interim your kind forbear. ance, "We are, Sir, your obedient servants, " KIESER AND CO." The hope that means might be found to enable Messrs. Carr, Josling, and Co., who stopped on the 24th ult. for about 300,0001., to resume has been disappointed. The firm have addressed the following communication to their creditors, and a petition has been filed for a private arrangement in the Court Of Bankruptcy. The house was largely connected with the trade with the north of Europe and the Mediterranean. It had been held in eateem for many years, and its fall will be regarded with great regret:- " 5, Laurence Pountney-place, London, Dec. 1. "It is with the utmost regret we have to inform you that our efforts for resuming payment have proved ineffectual. We have therefore requested Messrs. J. E. Coleman and Co., the accountants, to prepare a statement of our affairs and to have a meeting of our creditors convened at an early day. Requesting your forbearance, and assuring you of our utmaost efforts to realize aESets as speedily as possible for division, and to forward such other measures as may be most advantageous for the general interests of our creditors, "We are your obedient servants, " CARR, JOSLING, AND CO." The advices from Hamburg to-day indicate a degree of discredit such as perhaps has scarcely ever before been witnessed in any commercial city. All the efforts of the leading merchants, combined even with those of the Government, seem powerless to create the slightest revival of confidence. The -warehouses are choked with unsaleable produce, and, so far as instant availability is concerned, the acceptances even of respectable houses are treated as little better than blank paper. The lists of failures received to-day and yesterday are so long and so indiscriminate thatit isuseless topublish them. From the first it has been known that the consequences of the American convulsion would fall with far greater severity on Hamburg than on any other place, but the signs now presented show that conjointly with the inflated trade to New York a general speculative business in all kinds of imports must have been carried on to au unprecedented extent,and especially in connexion with Sweden and Norway. In the midst of this utter confusion the currency of Hamburg is sound, because, happily, it consists of specie. The break up of individual credit is not aggravated by any doubts as to the intrinsic value of the circulating medium. The scarcity of that circulating medium als compared with the amount of the liabilities which persons have promised to redeem with it is the inconvenience from which the indebted portion of the community are suffering but for that there is no remedy. If they have promisedto pav in silver, and have not got the silver, all the curreny doctors in the world could not teach them how to escape the acknowledgment that they are unable to meet their obligations. They might make a raid upon a neighbouring State to get a supply, or resolve to mix a certain percentage of spurious coins along .with the genuine, but there is no other expedient open, unless they have got goods which w i sell in foreign markets on sufficient terms to bring in the required relief. Meanwhi le toose who are lucky enough to hold silver after being compelled for many years past to pay inflated prices for flour, coffee, sugar, &c., can now get double the quantity of these articles they would otherwise have been able to obtain. The writers of the Birmingham school would doubtless think the position of the people of Hamburg might be much better at this moment if, instead of their currency consisting of silver, it were composed of promisoe to pay in silver without any silver at the back of them ; but the elasses to 'whom this currency belongs, as well a those who are entitled to have their contracts fulSlled, will consider the simple metal good enough. If the circulation had consisted of credit paper, all that could have been done would have been to issue more credit paper, and to force every claimant to take it as if it had been silver. Measures of this kind are still in the power of the Senate, if they think fit to adopt them; and therefore the existence of a metallic currency in no way cripples their modes of action. If they like to declare that, instead of demanding specie, every man who is entitled to receive it immediately shaU be content with a promize that it shall be handed to him at some more convenient time, the lawgivers can of course do so in the exercise of their sovereign functions. 'Up to the present moment they have pursued a moro honest course. They have not kept to the rigid plan of abstaining from aU interferencesuch a decision could never have been looked for on the continent, whatever might have been hoped with regard to England; but in adopting credit notes they have issued them as what they really are. They have not put them forth as the equivalent of specie, but merely as promissory notes bearing a sufficient rate of interest to induce persons to take them voluntarily. This issue they have limited to about 1,000,0001., but they can increase it to any extent they please. If, therefore, the Hamburg traders stiUl suffer, It cannot bo from the want of paper circulation. The Senate must certainly be deamed the best judges as to the point to which such advances can be safely carried. It is the want of credit-the want of a belief, in fact, that those who may make promises to pay will ever be in a condition to fulfil them, that is the irremediable eviL The Senate have no choice but to sacrifice the interests of the public by assuming the liabilities of the houses they thus distrust, or to allow the' consequences of the collapse which must fall somewhere to fall upon those by whom, eithor through reckless speculation or misplaced confidence, it has been occasioned. The following letter relates to the law of unlimited liability which is now applied to the trade of bankIng, and to no other trade whatever, although the natural principles that regulate one regulate all, and it can make no difference whether men are trusted with money or money's worth. The writer points out not only that all our colonial banks enjoy limited liability, but that the same is the case with the Bank of England, wthe Bank: of Ireland, the Bank of Scotland, and other similar establishments against which a breath of distrust ha never been directed. It is true that in the case of the colonial banks Government have so far meddled as to insist, with a view to protection, that the shareholders shaU be responsible to twice the amount of their subscriptions, but this is an exceptional absurdity which could never bear the teBt of general discussion. How can Government guarantee that double the amount of the original subscription will secure the public from loss ; and if they cannot make the matter certain, why should they undertake the responsibility of interfering with it at all? The simple thing contended for is the principle of freedom of contract. It Is the business of the Legislature to establish laws that shall compel men to fulfil such engagements as they may enter into, but to leave them to their own discretion as to the nature of those engagemenxts. If Smith, believing Brown to be an honest man, wishes to trust Brown with his money, on a mutual under standing that Brown wiU lnot pledge his private fortune for its safe custody, it is just as irrational for the Government to step in to prohibit such an arrangement as it would be for them to interfere against any other manifestation of confidence that Smith might deem expedient. Whynot also prohibit him from making foolish loans, from buying Mexican or Spanish bonds, and, in fact, from doing anything with his cash except under the exercise of paternal care ? Any one would suppose from the argaments of those who advocate the continental system of State control that if the people were allowed the freedom of entering into contracts of limited liabilty they would have no power of avoiding such contracts if they did not like them. But the enjoyment of the liberty to trist a limited bank, if they choose to do so, would not prevent tbem from insisting upon unlimited liability if they preferred it, or upon any modified form of liability theymight deem better. If the field were left clear, the unfettered sagacity of the public would soon lead them to the safest course. Those who deserved confidence would gat it, and although any body of persons that might like to bid for banking business, by recklessly holding out the temptation of their unlimited liability, would stil have the power to do so, it is probable the co nmunity would in many instances select to deal with concerns managed and owned exclusively by persons who would enter into no such speculative commitment, and who, knowing that they could get credit onlyby the nature of their transactions, would simply stake a certain sum, together with their character and experience, as a security that they would act for the benefit of all to the best of their ability. In some cases the unlimited guarantee of the directors and manager might be deemed an advantage, in others a liability on the part of the shareholders to double or treble the amount of the paid-up capital; but, whatever might be the plans that would prove most efficacious in inspiring confidence, they ought to be left free in each instance for the public choice, and not to be put upon us as Parliamentary leading strings:- " Dec. 1. " Sir,-I am glad to see in your city article of to-day the reference to the principle of unlimited liability in jointstock banks. "It has always astonished me to see how the British mind refuses to perceive aotual faots in preference to speculative arguments. " All, I believe, of our colonial banks are limited as to the liabilty of their shareholders. An Englishman is much the sme being in Sydney and Toronto as he is in London. We might reasonably suppose, then, that what succeeds in this respect out in those places would not fail in England, even h d it never been attempted. Bat, unless I mistake, the Bank of England, the Bank of Ireland, the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and tho British Linen Company are chartered--that is, limited bank, and they are certainly not the weakest in the kingdom. But these banks being limited have relatively to theirliabilities large paidup capitals and pay comparatively small dividends. A large (uncalled up) capital in your sharsholderse pockets is a good thing; in your own pocket I think it a better. " The single instance of the Royal British Bank would prove that the unlimited principle deters rich men from joining joint-stock banks as shareholders, and when any have so joined sends them and their property away just when the creditors want them. "I am, Sir, yours obediently, The precise amount of specie to be shipped for the East by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus on the 4th is 408,9611., of which 358,6561. is for India and Ceylon, and 50,3051. for China and bhe Straits. Nearly the whole is silver, the gold being 4,4001. only. Thetotal includes 250,0001. on account of the East India Company. At a meeting of bondholders of the New York and Erie Railway to-day a full report was presented by the committee lately appointed for the purpose, and itwas resolved thatthecommittee shouldberequested to receive subscriptions for the proposed new loan, and to communicate with the directors in New York with a view to such arrangements as may be considered requisite for the general protection of their interests. The following, on the linen trade during the past month and the probable influence of the American and continental diSiculties on ita future prospects, is from a circular of Messrs. D. Dewar, Son, and Sons:- " It cannot be expected that in the midst of commeroial disaster the linen trade should wholly escape. Nor kms It done so; bat thoae engaged in It are only novw beginm -te feel the effects, and it is much to be feared thWg the worst hu yet to come. The panic, it Is true, Is over in the States, and our 4st advlces give us reason to believe that matters are in a far better an healthier condition; bnt, as it must be obvious to all that It wi11 bea long time before b1ieiness can be resumed on that extended scale which it had recently attained, the exerclse of extreme caution becomes absolutely neoessary. To speculate upon an immediato return of prospe. rity woa d berashiandeed. The linen trade is widely extended, and from various countries throughout Europe where it finds a large market the criss is now beginning to be felt with much foroe. It is not only in our American exports, then, that a further faling off may be expected, for it is impossible to say to what extent the present state of things may react upon us from every country with -which we are connected. Ia France every precaution has been taken to prevent any serious consequences. It is, unfortunately, trae that, owing to tho prohibThve daties imposed on linen raanufactures in that country, our trade with it,s not very great- bat any great commercial dissters occurring in it would Lave a powerful effect in other parts of Europe. In Hamburg, too, every effort Is being made by the leading houses to render such aid as may be required' by those who are suffering or are likely to saffer. Thus it wilU be seen that attention is wholly engrossed with present and impending difficalties, and the best method of meetng and getting rid of them, future operations bning scarcely thought of. A s regards our home trade the numerous failures which have taken place, together with the closing of so manY bans, could not but hve a powerful effect. At the present moment it may be said to be completely stagnant. Busnes. can be done only at a great sacrifice, and mannfacturers find it absolutely necessary to shorten their production. In many places steps have already been taken for this purpose; whle in others, to meet the prewuae, wages have been reduced, though full work has been continued. Through these measures the oondition of the working classes during the coming winter irlll be one of great hardship." The amnexed on the leather trade is from Messrs Streatfeild, Laurence, and Mortimore:- - " The demand for most descriptions of leather has been less animated throughout the past month, which may be chiefly attributed to the disturbed state of the moneymarket. Supplies of fresh goods have increased, and, some tanners being desirous to press sales, quotations for mnost articles havo declined, notwithstanding the large Government contracts which have been recently taken, and the certainty that dealers throughout the kingdom hold but small stocks. It may therefore be reasonably assumed that with an improvement in monetary affairs the tone of the maarket would soon be restored. The necessity which now exits for keeping up a large army, both in India and at home, must cause a great and continued consumption of leather; indeed, already the principal boot and shoe manufacturers have orders which cannot be completed for several months, and many are unwilling to enter into fresh contracts from inability to execute them. There are also large orders out for artillery harness, accoutrements, &c." The following on the wine trade is from Mesrsa. iUghtly and Simon:- "F or several consecutive years we have had to announce deficient and inferior vintages throughout France and Germany. It is this year our pleasing duty to communicate intell gence of a more cheering nature ; for, although in some of the French vineyards the crop is again veryshort- owing, In the Bordelais, for instance, to the reappearance of the oidium, and in the South to violent baslatorms and inundations--we may yet, we think, oharacterize this as a memorable year not only from the excellent quality of its produce, but u6o from the marked decline of the vine disease. Nevertheless, while the crop throughout Prance is by no means abundantk a very considerable demand has to be met-fir-t, in France itself (where successive bad yields slnce 1851 have reduced stocks m the hands of growers and the trade to a scale unprecedentedly low); secondly, in the different foreign markets - and further, in this country, where the consumption of irench wines is decidedly on the Increase." The Spirit of the Age has arrived from China with 865,9001T. of tea. A petition in bankruptcy was opened to-day against Mesars. Charles Frederick and E. Schlesinger, merchants, of Basiughall-street. The liabilities of the fizm are said to be large, the recent period of its formation being taken into account. Let' DiMaries for 1858 have just been Dublished, and contain, as usual, a mass of well arran;ged information for the mercantile and general community.
TRB BXTBNSION OF THE SUBMARINB TBLEGRAPH TO MALTA. We have been favoured with the following account of the incidents that occurred in laying down the fmbmarine telegraph to Malta:- "Malta, Nov. 23. You know by our telegrams of the 17th and 18th that We have obtained another success in the extension of submarine telegraphs, and Malta is now brought into telegraphic communication with England. "The Elba met with very severe weather on her paesge from the Mersey, and having had a portion of her bulwarks stove in, and two boats carried away, sho was obliged to remain at Gibraltar three days to refit. She arrived at Cagliari on the 10th of November, where she had been very anxiously expected for about a week. "We, with our Assistant-Engineer, Mr. F. C. Webb, had been there a week, daily expecting her arrival, having gone out vid Marseilles. Her Majesty's ship Desperate, Captain G. W. Watson, R,N., comrmander, had also been waiting at Cagliari from the beginning of the month, this vessel ha ing been liberally grunted by the Government to afford assistance in the ope. ration of laying don the cables. While waiting the arrival of the Elba Captain Watson availed himself of the delay for taking a line of soundings on the oourse to be followed. He ascertained the greatest depth to be about 1,025 fathoms for an extent of 45 miles. "Seveial days snorowere required at Cagliari for prepara. tion previous to starting on the hazardous operation-of paying out the cable. All hands were busily occupied till Saturday, -the 14th, in this duty, in which valuable assist. ance was rendered by the active and inteligent officers of the Desperate and tbeir men. Every facility for getting through the work, in arranging the offices, and in completing the land line was afforded by the authorities of Sardinia and Mr. Consul Craig, all of whom evinced a deep interest in the undertaking. The Liverpool Steam Tug Company's steamer Blazer, sent out by us for the purpose of towing, &c., brought Newall and Webb from MarseUles. "On the afternoon of the 13th, in a perfect calm, the vesseLs of the expedition were all anchored off Cape St. Elias, about a querter of a mile from shore, the Elba rather closer in; and the end of the cable was safely landed raady for starting at daylight next morning. "During the night the weather changed and became squaUy, with frequent showers, accompanied by much thunder aud lightning, and, indeed, the appearances were so unfavourable that it was decided to defer the starting. "By evening of the 14th of November the weatber again calmed; the barometer was high and steady, asd at 9 p.m. the expedition got under way, the Desserane leading, and t*e Blazer having the Elba in two. During the night the weather was very calm, but a heavy swell from the eastward was soon felt, and in passing Cape Carbonara (the south-east point of Sardinia) this increased so much as to show that there had been strong winds blowing outside, whlch had not bean felt in theell sheltered Bay of Cagliarl. "The sweLl being right abeam caused the vessel to roLl heavily, but the line was paid out without difficulty. On the morning of the 15th the clouds began to appear on the east horizon and the wind to blow heavily from the south. "By n o'clock this had increased almost to a gale, and the vessel rolled still more heavily, each sea washing right across her deckrs, and It was found necessary in order to steady her to hoist foro and aft sails. Add to this violent squalls with thunder and lightning close over our heads, and you may conceive the anxiety of our situation. Under these circumstances the operation of paying out the cable became extremely hazardous on account of the difficulty of standing to the break and passing freely from place to place. By the arrangement of tbe cone and rings the cable wound steadily off the coil on to the break wheel, and the speed of the v fesel being maintained at about 4.j knots an hour the operation of the break In regulating the speed of paying out was very satisfactory. At the height of the gale the wind veered round to the south-east, and the vesse, being now much lightened, roled less and rose weU to the wave. During the gale wo were passing over the deepest water, extending a distance of 45 miles. The whole of this timo cabins and berths (deok) were washed through, and cooldng was out of the question. However, all were too anxious about the cable to think of such small inconveniences. About the very height of the gale the Desperate holsted the signal 'Tbe barometer indicates fine weather,' and shortly after, in trutht the wind began to abate, and by evening it had quite fallen, and, though for some time tno searain very high, we were entirely relieved from our From this time al wvent smoothly, the weather continuing fine up to the last. On Monday, the 16th, at dayliRht, we sighted Maritimo far to the northward, and soon after the coast of Sicily; at sunset we were off Pantellaria. On Tuesday morning Gozo was in sight, and in the afternoon the Admiralty brig Hearty came out to welcome us, with Mr. Andrews, the supenntendent of the Mediter. ranean Extension Telegraph Company, on board tO suggest an alteration in the landing-place. For the purpose of deciding this NewaU went on ooard the Desperate to reconnoitre, having previously arranged signals for the Elba to steer by, and her speed was reduced as much as possible. In consequence of the change we did not come to an anchorage tiU about 9 o'clock, instead of doing so before dark, as we had calculated on. The distance from shore was about three-quarters of a mile, and the operation of landlng the end inthe dark wassomewhat tedious, it being necessary to examine and mark out the course carefuUy. About 4 o'clock the end of the cable was landed, amid the cheers of our men and the sailors, who appeared as wel Pleased as ourselves with the sucoessful termination of our labours. - During the voyage a constant communication was kept up with Cagliari, and the cable was tested every quarter of an hour. It was also immediately on landing tested, and the insulation asoertained to be very good. Messrs. Leffier and Viechelman, in the employment of Messrs. Siemans and HaIske, of Berlin, by whom the beautiful instruments supplied to us were constructed, have made a series of electrical experiments which we believe will be entren-ely valuable for future operations. !jnese gentlemen also conducted the working of the instruments during the whole voyage, and go on with us to Corfu. "Since our arrival we have been engaged in completing the land line, for which the assistance of a party of Sappers and Miners has been kindly granted by Colonel Crawley, R. E. In the meantime a temporary offico is established in one of tho militaryhut at St. George'aBay, wherethe cable islanded. "We can scarely express the lively sense of gratitude wo entertaln towards the Governor, Sir W. Reid, Admiral Lord Lyons, and General Sir Jobn Pennefather, for the kind manner in which they have aided us by thefr authority in all we have kad to do to get through our work. "The Gregald has been blowing with great violence sinoo Friday morning (21st inst.), but has now abAted, and we 1e tblQ* ior Cork to-morrew morning,"
