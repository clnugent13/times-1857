'Whben the to district parish churches wore built by the Bethnal. arenx Comwittee, a loud agislng fromz barilsl in the piariah, was at the vlispOea of the late flocesan, Bisholp Blomnfield, It amounxted to aNbout 42le a-year, and was appropriated by hLim to the sustentalion of 'the newv churches which had only Email endownteut* and were not suporoce by rater, Anothe: resource fromwhich aseltauoe wasr expeced in maIntinin the paroceJLal system, was by weekly collections. It was thought th a since th ere are no peer rent,, every member of the sieveral confaegations moight fabily be expected ' to lay by him In store, as God has ~red him,"I for purpoeee of pi[ety and Wktarity in his owni district. Withth sanction of the Bishop It vwa arrnged that the eooiecrtins thus raised should he eppropriatd to the relief of thie poor, to the suopport of the schools, aBd to the augmentatIon of the income of the minister.

BRITS HEROisM IN TDA.-The British journals. and people are paying high tributes to the heroism of their countrymen in India; but these tributes are not more eulo- gistio then are deserved. There were feats performed at thestorming of Delhi which equal, in intrepid valour, anything the poets tell of at the siege of Troy, and display a Roman courage of which any nation might justly be proud. Indeed, the attacking of the Mogul capital at all-a place containing 150,000 inhabitants, and defended by 25,000 of the rebel force, with hardly half as many men as were at our Tiemann meeting at the Academy of Mnusi the other evening, was itself one of thoce bold, dashing adventures which show of what mettle the soldlers of gEngland are made. The leadinz Incidents of the grand catastrophe, as already narrate In these columns, we think, sur- pass in dramatic interest those of the memorable. demonstration against Sebastopol dering the late Russian war. Among the many actions of surpasing merlt which illustrated the closing combat was a feat of heroic devotion performed by Lieutenant 8alkeld, of the Engineers, and tbree sergeants, to whom was Intrusted the blowing open of the Cashmere-gate. To effect this purpose it was necessary to affix bags of powder to the gate under a fire of musketrypoured through lopholes in the door itself and from the walls on both si(es. Merely to reach the end in view was more than could reasonably be expected, but to escape with life was a thing hardly to be thought of; and the chances of destruction proved to be scarcely less overwhelming than they must have appd to these courageous men. Lientenant Salkeld, Eeverely wounded once, jut managed to stagger to the gate and put his burden at the desired spot before another bullet brought him down. The first sergeant who advanced to fire the train fell dead the second lit the match and fell riddled with balls; andthe third alone escaped unhurt by casting himself into the ditch to avoid the effect of the explosion. The heroism of theEe gallant men as thus displayed was not for nothing. It was not a mere dare-devil exhibition, or a vain-glorious seeking for reputation at the cannon's mouth. The explosion laid the gate in ruins, on which the storming party burst in. Almost every one carrying ladders was knocked over. The breach and gate were then forced, and on the resistless torrent rushed, defying all opposition The British forces gained possession of the iarge buildings in the neighbourhood, forced their way along the ramparts to the Cabul-gate in the face of a most obstinate resistance, until at length the whole line of works, including the Cashmere and hIoree gates and bastions, and the EnglSsh church and colege, were all in their hands. we repeat it, and, as Americans we can afford to repeat it, there is nothing in the annals of ancient or modern warfare to surpass such achievements as these-and the home exultation over them, therefore, is neither mIsplhoed nor unnan.t ral. Indeed the whole history of the Indian rebellion brngs out in bold relief the immeasurable sgperiority of theAnglo-Saxon race over Mussulmans, Tartars, and ESindoos -a superiority which scouts at the supposition that the British empire in India can be extirpated by a race or races, of which that now famous monster, Nana Sahib, is the type. The great point of Interest in the next news from India will be the fate of Lucknow. The last mail, it will be remembered, brought despatches stating that the Reddency (a cluster of buildings oocupied by the besieged in the suburbs of the city) had been relieved. But it turns out now, on closer inspection, that the relief -was but partial, and such as to excite new fears for the ultimate safety of thenoble little garrison. General IHavelock and Sir James Ontram, it wiU be borne in mind, crossed the Ganges from Cawnpore on the 19th of September, and after some desperate fighting, which cost them some 490 men, compellng the Sepoys to fall back, reached the Residency on the 25th, just in time to save it from probable annihilation, for not only were the provisions of the besieged nearly exhausted, but it was discovered the rebels had dug and completed mines all about the Residency, in order to. precipitate its destruction by blowing the outworks to pieces. Unfortunately, however, there were so many of the, sick, wounded, and helpless within the walls that the garrison could not be brought away. We have read of some commanders who, under the circumstanoes, would not have scrupled to make sure of the whole at the expense of the sick, -but -with such men as Havelock, Ontram, and Inglis (tbe latter commanding the garrison), humanity Is no less an object than military success; and so, down to the period of our lateut advices, that little band of 500 Britons were stil in the Residency, and as the Residency Is, as before remarked, within the recincts of a city in the hands of many thousands of rebels howling for their blood, no wonder that anxiety is on the rack at home to hear the news that is to come. Onr information as to the movements of General Havelock after the relief of the garrison is meagre and unintelligible, but it seems to be certain that he en. deavonred to obtain possession of the city at large, bat some. how, failing in that, had resolved to fail hack pon Cawnpore, leaving beuind, however, a condiderable force to strengthen Luokuowr. It nowv remains to be seen whether that strength v;ill last the besieged until the day of their final deliverance is come.-lVeio YFork Express.

FOP,EIGN INTELLrGENcE. [A portion of the followiug appeared in our second edition Of yesterday:-1 FRANCE. (FROM OU3 OWN CORPBSPON-DMIT.) PARIS, THURSDAY, DEKa. 17, 6 P.m. Accounts from Cherbourg state that the Russian naval division under the command of Commodoro iournetzoff, consisting of the screw corvettes Vayarodss, Royarin, and Navieh, with the steam transporta Dvgde, Plasttun, and Strotk, have left for the E13ast. his squadron, wrhich carries 48 guns and 840 men, has been at Cherbourg since the 5th of Iovember last. Apropos of this squadron, it may not be uninteresting to mention a few more particulars relative to the Russian navy, and especially as to the pay of the seamen. The fixed pay of a Russian sailor is extremely low. For an able seaman it is not more than 24s. a-year. They are clothed by the State, and their rations while at sea belong to them. It is said that the ration of a Russian seaman was calculated by Peter the Great after a trial of a month on his own appetite, and few modern seamen are able to consume more than half of the provisions allowed them. The remainder produces him on an average 1l. a-month. Each Russian sailor is, mnoreover, allowed a measure of brandy aud half a measure of wine daily. The pay of a non-commissioned officer is not greater than that of a seaman. The only advantage he has is that he receives half a ration more, which is equivalent in money to 17. a-month. They have the privilege of selecting the place for their hammocks. Previous to the late war the Russian ships of the line were incompletely manned, and the smaller vessels overcrowded. The consequence was that the crew of a ship of tire line kept a dlouble watcb, and half the crew of a smaller vessel slept on deek. As the Government pays for his clothing, a Russian sailor is nct interested in taking care of it, and thence arises the want of cleanliness with which they are justly reproached. Each Russian ship-of-war leaves a portion of her crew on shore, wvho are artisans by profession. These men work for the public, and are permitted to retain half of their earnings; the remainder forms a fund from wvhich each seaman, on retiring after 20 years' service, receives about 51. in money, and -which enables him to return home to his family, if any are living after so long a period. The pay of Russian naval officers is likewise very moderate, but, as they have a liberal table allowance, and receive an equivalent for the rations of the servants allowed to them, but whom they do not take to sea, their financialcondition is not so bad. After 20years' zervice a RuEsian naval officer may retire with an income equal to one-third of his pay, after 25 years two-thirds, and after 30 years his full pay. A captain of a Russian Ehip-of-war has the entire management of his ship. One of his officers, appointed by the Government, and named inspector, shares the responsibility. Should the accounts of a captain be found incorrect at the regular period for rendering them, two-thirds of the deficiency are debi'ted to the captain, and one-third to the inspector. WA hen a ship-of-war is in port the captain sends a return to the Admiral of the number of his crew, and the Paymaster-General supplies him with the estimnated amount of money, which the captain distributes among the captains of companies, who in turn pay the sailors. NWhen a captain quits port for a distant voyage he receives on board extra funds for contingencies, and with this money he pays for provisions and clothing for his men, and sends the Government a duplicate of the bills receipted and checked by the Russian Consuls; another duplicate remains in his hands as his own voucher.

RUSSIA. (FROe OUR R BERLIN coRREsroNDFrT.) BERLIN, DEc. 1C. The perusal of Russian periodical literature certainly strengthens one in the belief that, for one reason or an other, the political ambition of Russia is turning its eyes more aad more away from the West, and directing them towards the East; on the other hand, ber conviction of the necesity of the increased development of education and civilization, at once the means and the end of her successful extension in the East, leads her statesmen to look to the West rather as the source from which she is to derive those means than as the quarter where she is likely to obtain predominant influence. Rnssians attribute thls change of front to the rupture of the lloly Alliance, which received its coup de grace in the early stages of the late Eastern conflict, in which neither Prussia nor Austria showed themselves in any way disposed to sacrifice their own interests and deviate frora their true policy to suit the Power that had hitherto styled itself the Protector of Gettrmany. Russia, say they, being now released l,y the ingratitude of Germany fronm any further obligation to watch over her safety and interests1 is hlenceforthat liberty toatten:dsolelyto herown, wh~ich lie in the East. The last clinching conviction of the uselessness of wasting its providential wvisdom on thankless Europe seems to have been brought home to the Russian heart by the late events at Stuttgart, which showed beyond the possibllity of mistake that, however ready France mig ht have been to bring the wvar with Russia to an end and procure the conclusion of a peace at Paris, she wvas not moved thereto by pure love to Russia, or by any desire to throw off the English alliance and thenceforwrard share the dominion of the w orld w;ith RuSSIa. In conformity with this presumed conviction on the part of Russia, we find her Government since then taking up a very reserved attitude on the question of the Danubian P'rincipalities, and its press toning dowtn rapidly the warmth of its advances towards lFrance, and extendinog its hand, thoulgh not particurlary cordially, towrards England. The development of Wvestern civilization at home and the ex;tension of its territory eastwards seem reaDly now to be the accepted mission of the Russian empire. Although wvithdrawing from the mouths of the Dlanube as though she had nolonger anything tomake or to meddle there, and for thepresent leaving liVhomre7 w larement mafaef in Constantinople to expire as slowly or as rapidly as his constitntion and the attention of his friends will permiit him, Russia is exhibiting the most untiring activity along her wholeoline of Asiatic frontier, extending from 3a deg. to 135 deg. east longitude. Leaving the Caucasus and the Circassians for the present unmhentioned, I propose to sum up what has transpired of some Or rae most recent incidonts on the Russian frontier in connexion with Persia, the Casplan Sea, Tartary, and China. In the flit named country, thanks to Afr. Murray, the Turcomans, and the Shah's arbitrary will, the Russians have of late found three opportu- nities of making themselves lndispensable, though, as it would appear, anything but welcome, allies and neighbours. The various troubles in which Persia is just now involved have induced the Shah to sutm- mon Peruk Khan, of European celebrity, toTeheran, as it was (Oct. 18) his intention to llnvest him with the highest dignity in the empire, and to nominate him Sadr Azam. Although the terms of the late peace with England are stated to have been punctuallv fulflled, the relations of the Persian Court to M 5r. Murray are described as being more lpineux than ever, In return for the mission of General lelikoff, whom Prince Bariatinsli' had despatched to the Shah ostensibly to announce to him the Prince's having entered on the command-in.chief of all the troops in the Caucasus, the former bas lately eent the latter, at the hands of a high officer of his Court, the order of the Sun and Lion, and, among other rich presents, a charger from the Shah's own stud. Thereal aubject-matter of these two misions :Was, hgvoyer, the aettlunient of the nioxne=n the Russians were to receive from Persia for the Services rendered to the latter during the war with England. Russia is understood to have claimed for this the definitive cession of a group of islands in the Caspian Sea, close to the Persian coast, of which she has been for some years in provisional oCcupation. On October the 27th Sartib Davoud Khan, an Extraordinary Envoy from Persia, was received with great pomp at the head-quarters of Prince Bariatinski ia Tiflis; the subject of his mission was an irruption of the Turcomans, 8,000 strong, into the province of Asterabad. Some accounts state that Davoud Khan was commissioned to express the Shah's thanks for the assistance already rendered him by Russia in repelling this incursion, and to make further arrangements for a common action against these predatory tribes for the protection of comnierce and the population of the neighbouring country; while others describe the Shah as bat little inclined to accept the profferecl assistance, and Davoud Khan as provided with ful powers to proceed from Tifls to St. Petersburg in case of his not arranging matters at the former place to the Shah's satisfaction. The internal troubles thathave broken out in Persia appear to have been caused by the Shah's arbitrary nomination of Emir Nisam, one of his natural sons, to succeed him on the throne, wbich he did by a proclamation dated October 31. As it would seem, there are no standing fixed laws in Persia regulating the succession to the throne, but that the custom of prescription had hitherto established itself, that the reigning Shah should make his selection of an heir to his throne out of the number of his legitimate sons-the Princes of the blood-and not from among the offspring he might have had with any concubine. On the present occasion he appears to have set aside the custom which was dear to his people, and by the exertion of an arbitrary selection of an illegitimate son to have given rise to great dissatisfaction and some disturbances in his empire. The Geographical Society in St. Petersburg is at length on the point of seeing its long-cherished plan of a scientific journey of discovery in Ehorassan carried out. It is trusted that the very friendly relations now existing between Persia and Russia will incline the Government of the former to extend all possible assistance to the Russian travellers. At the last meeting of the society the attention of the members was calledto thefact that this Portion of Asia is nearly unknown, while in the regions further eastwards the Russian and English pioneers of geography have so nearly traversed the space that intervenes between the territories of their respective countries tbat their surveys wil very soon join on to each other. As the Geographical Society does not possess sufficient means to carry out this expedition unaided, the Emperor has arranged that its members shall be supported at Government expense while on their travels, and that the Asiatic Society shall supply them with all necessary instruments and divide the remaining expense with the Geographical Society. The conduct of the expedition has been intrusted to a gentleman named Chanykoff, who, by dint of long residence in Khorassan, has made himself intimate with the language and customs of that part of the country. With a view to improve the communications with Persia, and also of taking up a more imposing attitude towards her, the Emperor has just given his approbation to a proposal made by the Stadtholder of the Caucasus, that a town and a port shall be erected on the north-western bank of the Caspia-n Sea in connexion with Petrowski, a thirdrate fortress already existing there. There seems to be a fair prospect of the town, &c., soon coming into existence, for great attractions are offered to settlers there in the shape of 10 years' freedom from all taxes, &c., and foreigners of all countries and ranks are admissible to settle there. By the erection of a town on this spot Russia will come into close propinquity with the wild tribes of the Turcomans that inhabit the eastern coast of the Casplan; hitherto the nearest point was Astrachan, on the western coast, which, in spite of Russia having monopolized the whole maritime traffic of the Caspian, doubtless offers less facilities for comnmunication than a neighbouring spot on land will. The town and port, which are to bear the same name as the fortress, are to be placed under the rule of the commander of the troops on the Caspian Sea, at present Prince Orbelianr. It may therefore be looked on as a matter of certainty that within a very few years Russia will be mistress of the entire littoral of the Caspian, as she is already of its waters. Some further communications on the subject of what is going on on the Chinese frontier I must reserve till to-morrow. ITALY. (FROM OUCR OOWN COnnEUSONDENT.) TURIN, DEC. 15. The early departure of the post to rrance renders it rather difficult to give, uDon the same day, a perfectly full and satisfactory account of an event like the opening of the Sardinian Parliament; but I do not think that in the hasty despatch I yesterday sent you any point of importance was left unnoticed. I ought perhaps to have stated, for the information of those curious in details, that the King wore a general's uniform, and looked bluff and soldierly as usual-a monarch well suited to a brave and warlike people; that, while the floor and benches of the hall were crowded with gentlemen in evening costume or in fuU dress uniform, and the diplomatic tribune displayed the usual blaze of gilding, among which one knew not whether most to admire the Oriental splendourof the Turkish envoy or the equally dazzling magnificence of certain representatives of Occidental majesty, the capacious galleries that surround the hall were crammed with a very motley gathering, threefourths of their area being allotted to the general public, which entered upon the principle of first come first served; and that this motley assemblage, consisting in great part of the lower orders, behaved with a decorum which could hardly have been surpassed by highly-bred gentlemen. Those dreadfully formal officials of the English Houses of Parliament who guard the galleries, suppress whispers, and enforce a sitting posture, would assuredly have swooned away at what passed yesterday in the public galleries of the Sardinian Chamber-at the sight of the people standing on the benches, and at the sound of the cheering of the eager spectators. I believe that here, as in England, it is against regulation for the public audibly to eipress its feelings in the legislative halls, but probably nothing short of clearing the galleries would have checked suichl demonstrations, or would have stopped the hearty cheers with which the Turinese yesterday greeted the appearance of their King and marked their approbation of his words. His Majesty, like agood-humoured man as he is, seemed to take it all as a matter of course, left off reading when the people began to cheer and clap hands and to scream "Viva il Re," and resumed when it pleased his subjects to be still again. The first and great out. burst of enthusiastic applause was at the end of the first paragraph of the speech, wher. he spoke of "those liberal principles on which reposes, henceforward immovably (oramcui in modo irremovibilc), our national policy." These words, pronounced -with particular emphasis, were clearly understood as an implied answer to the pretensions of the clerical party, and wera placed in the scale as a counterpoise to the advantages that party obtained in the late elections. The monarchical feeling Is extremely strong in this country, and the King, constitutional Sovereign though he be, has it in his power to do an immense deal for good or for evil. Fortunately, the present Monarch is an honest and sensible man, who prefers ruling with the love and for thegood of his people to following examples that have been set him in other countries, and who sincerely respects and is attached to the order of things instituted by his late father; and thus he consults his own interests and dignity, for the position he holds is far prouder and more enviable than any he could obtain by adopting a retrograde course and seeking a more absolute rule. Apprehendons were entertained, or feigned, by some persons here that when the list of the Deputies was called over, for the oath to be taken, certain names would provoke marks of dislike from the public. If anybody really expected this, he did less than justice to the sense of propriety which distinguishes the Piedmontese. Not a single unpleasant manifestation was made. At one name only-that ! of Margotti, a priest, who is often turned into ridi- cule by the Liberal ptess-a slight suppressed titter ran round the Chamber. But neither indoor nor out, as far-as I have been able to aecertain, was the least demonstration made against any individual. Everything passed with perfect order and tranquillity. The last words of the speech, in which the Eing expressed his hope that the deliberations of the Chambers would tend to the welfare of Piedmont " p o? tlhe Qo=9 Itaian patriG" W' e VA yesterday mentioned, received with great applause, and doubt)ess they gladdened the hearts of the many Italians from all parts of Italy who have sought and found in the Sardinian dominions that liberty to which they have hitherto in vain aspired for their mative land. The day may stil be far distant when the free institutions which thrive so well here shall be extended east and soutb, but it is something in the meantime that Italy contains one small kingdom where freedom flourishes, and where political refuigees, not wild visionaries and reckless plotters of the Mazzinian stamap, but men, many of them, among the foremost in their own country for talent and honour, can reckon on a friendly welcome and a tranquil asylum. Yesterday's proceedings must, I think, have the effect of strengthening the hands of the Liberal party. The Royal sentiments have been clearly indicated,and any hopes that may have been entertained by the clerical party that the Sovereign might be induced to accept a Ministry formaed from its ranks must now be exceedingly attenuated. If the present Government does not possess a sufficient majority in the Chamber, there wiU be a dissolution. Count Cavour must then modify his Cabinet, and get rid of at least one of his colleagues whose unpopularity certainly had an unfavourable influence on the last elections. If, on the other hand, he finds himself able to carry on the government of the country with the present Chamber, the increased strength of the Opposition on the Rigbt will have, it is presumable, the good effect of promoting union among the Liberals. With a commnon and active foe in the field, the supporters of the constitutional cause will not allow slight differences to sunder tbem, or to divert them from the pursuit of that end which they all in reality have at heart. To-day's Armionia has an article on the King's speech, of which it declares its approbation. It picks out those passages and expressions which are naturally the least pleasing to its party, and takes pains to declare its gratification at them. It talks of its Liberal principles, of its attachment to the Constitution, and it expresses satisfaction 'at the symptoms it thinks it discerns that the Governaent will cease to be a party, that Ministers will put away party manceuvres, arts, and tendencies, and act upon broader and more beneficent principles. The exact mneaning of the clerical party is not easily discovered. Probably itself would be puzzled to explain it. It deemed it necessary to say something about the King's speech; it would have been impolitic to censure it, so it tries to cover its feelings of dissatisfaction with plausible generalities. As for its declaration that it has never resisted Liberal principles, and that it upholds the S&atuto, the Ultramontane Pantaloon of the Piedmontese press can surely not imagine that it will impose upon anybody. It is very well known what sort of liberty the party which the Armonia represents would give to the country, and that, whatever its professions, its principles are diametricaUy opposed to those of civil and religious liberty. I have good reason to know that the King, although nothing in his manner yesterday betrayed emotion, felt deeply the enthusiastic reception given to him, and was greatly gratified by it. He well knows what it meant, and by what line of conduct he may secure the continuance of the respect and affection his subjects testify towards him. Letters from Central Italy, received to-day, say that what is there known of the disposition and intentions of Victor Emmanuel has raised the spirits of the Liberals, temporarily depressed by the result of the Piedmontese elections.

SUICIDE ON TH: SOUTH-WESTEN RAILWAY.- A few evenings ago a man, whose name has not yet been ascertained, committed suicide by placing himself ia front of a train on the Stalnes, Woking, and Wokiugham branch of the South-Western Railway. At the inquest, which was before Mr. Clarke, the coroner, it was elicited that the train left Reading at 6 15 p.m., and whea In the deep cutting between Ascot and Sunningdale stations the driver, by means of the lamps, perceived a man on the line walking towards the train. He hallooed to the man, and gavewarning by the whistle, but in an instant the train was upon him, and he was knocked down. On the train reaching the Dext station the driver communicated to the stationmaster what had occurred, and some men were sent back to look after the unfortunate man, After proceeding a little distance the man was found on the up-line, lying with his face downwards, and life was extinct. He had not beou injured by the wheels of the carriages or engine, and death appeared to have been instantaneous from a severe blow on the chest. Both legs were broken, and he was much bruised about the face. Evidence wasgvenofthedeceasedhavingbeen seeninti neighbourhood a few hours previously, and, though his appearance was neat and clean, it was evident to those who saw him that he was in circumstances of great distress, and was travelliDg through the country soliciting alms. The last place he was traced to have been seen at was at a public. house near the Grand-stand, Ascot, where he partook of some feed which had been given to him, and though an attempt was mnade to convernewith him it was unsuccessful, for he refused to reply to any questions put to himn,a Re was very dejected and mnelancholy, probably In consequence of his9 destitute position. The only money he had in his possession was a sixpence. There was no footpath or public right of way aoross the line of raUiway, so that the deceased mast have gone there for the purpose of committing suicide. In the absence, however, of direct testimony on thispoint, the jury returned a verdict that the deceased was killed on tho railway, but whether by accident or otherwise there was no evidence to show. The man was about 60 years of a2e.

AILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Friday Evealng. The railway-market has again experienced a general advance, and, although in some ca-es the highest prices of the day were not fally maintained to the close, left offE at an improvement of £ to 2 per cent. The stocks in greatest demand were South-Western, South-Eastern, and Sheffield. Great Northern were exceptionaUy without alteration. Coloniml descriptions were active, and a further rise occtrred in nearly every class of shares; Grand Trunk of Canada especially closed about 2' per cent. above the last price yesterday. French were better, except Parls and Lyons, which slightly receded; the small foreign lines were also in request and generally advanced. American securities were dull, and without chanae of importance. Canada Bonds improved j per cent. Mines show no remarkable variation. In Jointstock banks an improvement of about los. took place in Ottoman. The transactions in miscellaneous securities were rather numerous, and Australian Agricultural and the discount companie3 left off at a further advance; Crystal Palace were firm, the results of the meeting yesterday being considered satisfactory.

THE JEUFOSSE TRIAL. (From Galignaniig Messenger.) ETIe Court of Assizes of the Euro Yesterday resumed thi' triail. The uiiterest it excited was, if possible, prester than. exx preceding days. M. diI Haz6, in completin his evidence of tbe previous day, said that Mademoiselle aurence. thegoverness, hatd in his prerence frequently cwas a4gniricaxt~ glances. at, Guillot, and had once placed her hand In his,.before, however, all the persons assembled in the dnnroom and remarked aloud, "1How cold you are!" - mg.doComr daeu,a professor at the College of Troyes,. brotaer-da. lhw of Guillot, said that he also had notioed a oertain dere of familiarity between GnSllot and the governe. Tlhig itnes added that he had blamed his sister for having lnteroeeptea the insulting letter which Ernest do Tea, fosse had written to her husband, because the fact of Guilot not noticing it gave him the appearance of a man who was so cowardly that he would submit to be insulted rather than fight. He sd also that reports had been spread that GuiUot was making love to Mademoisele Blanche, and even that Madame ansllot encouraged bim lz so doing; and Gullot considered this such an insult to bis wife that he had intended fighting a duel with the author of the reports; Guillot had at the same time assured witness that it was the governess he was paying attention to, and not Mademoiselle Blanche. The sanme witness meon. tioned a curious circumstance,-that Gu&llot frequently gave powder and shot to (;repel, and that it was not impossible that It was with the very powder and shot which he had given that he was killed. He added that Guilot, notwithstanding his conduct was blameable, was a kindhearted man. Mlademoiselle Barrault, an elderly lady, aunt to Madanie Guilot., and residing -with her, gave Guilltt a high character, and said that he was remarkably kind and affectionate towards his wife. She declared that not only had she never heard that Guillot. had made advances to Mademoiselle Blancbe, but that that young lady had, in -nawer to her inquiries, told her positively that he had never addressed an unbecoming observation to her. She added that Gulot had on e observed that Madame de Jeufosse was wrong in acting haughtily towards him, as he coild, if he pleased, make her go on her kUees and beg his pardon. ladame Datfoy, of Cauvionurt, stated that she had known all tho parties, had noticed that GxlUot. p aid marked attenation to the governess, and had hea-rd that he had spoken in scandalous terms of that voung lady ancl Mademoiselle Blanche. She had one day seen Mad me de Jen. fGsse in a state of great exasperation, caused, ao she told witness, by G)illot havlng gone about declaring that hewould dishonour ademoiselle Blanche, and would never allow her to marry. M Hoet, ani ex-notary of Gaillon, said that he had remonstrated with Gullot about hia attentions to Ma. demoiselle Laurence, but GuUlot had laughedl at him, andl had b13oasted of having received letters from her. He (wit. -ness) had told all that to Madamne de Jeufosse. Mademolei6le Laurence hadl afterwards told his wife that GaUllot was ao. customed to prowl about the chateau at night, and that, Mademoiselle Blanche was at such times agitated ; butt le had considered aU that only foolish gossip, and ha1 dl. rected his wife to take no notice of it. Ho had hsaid that the people of the chateau had resolved to " popper" the mau who went into their grounds at night. Wit. ness added that Mdame do Jeufosse was a strictly pious, virtuous, and excellent woman, Madame lnstt wife of the preceding witness, after speaking in hi h terms of Madame de JeufoEse, deposed that ademolselle Laurence had told her that the manner of MAdemolsells Blanche had become strange, that she had heard her talkin with some one in her chamber, and that it would be as weN to tell Madame de Jeufosse; but Mademoiselle Laurence he cl afterwards admitted that she was mistaken in what she had said. She (Laurence) had, however, told her that Guilot was endeavouring to make himself agreeable to Mademoiselle Blancho, and witness had observed the same thing. A tradesman named Criquebceaf deposed that he had bsene very intimate with Guillot, and thought him a frank, honest felowv; buthe was of very light character, and talked in an extravagant way. Guillot had told him that he was making love to Mademoiselle Laurence, but thatshe repelled him, and threatened to tell about him. Guillot had subsequently informcd him that he was miaking love to Mdemoiselle Blanche, and be gave him an account of his relations with her. He was accustomed, he said, to go into the orangery and to stand on a chair to talk with Mademoiselle Blanche, and he described the signals which he made to get her to come to the rendezvous, Mademoisole Lqurence suspected somethlng, and that circumstance rendered the meetings difficult. " You must give us," said the president to the witness, " the details which you gave to the examining magistrate." " Well, GuiUot told me that things between him and Mademoiselle Blanche cam. menced by a pressure of the hand to which she responded; and that a rendezvous was then agreed on. To that rendezvous sbe came with a lighted candle. 'You little fool 1 said Gullot, ' how can you think of coming with a light!' and he blow oat the candle. GuUlot said that he ob. tamned a second rendezvous some days after; they stood at the window a long time kissing each other. He corresponded with her. I told him that he was wrong in putting names to his letters, and he said that the would not again do so. Guillot zsserted ho once slipped a letter into a skein of green worsted, and handed it to Blanche. In returniDg be noticed that she was cold towards him, and he said to wit. ness, 'I wager that little Blanche has been to confession, and that tbe priest has been lectnring her;' and be afterwards said that ho had asked Blanche if such had not boen the casec, and she had answered in the affirmative. Guillot was accustomed to throw little pieces of wood at the windows of Mademoiselle Blanche to let het know that he was outside. Once, in climbing up, to the v'indow, he saw her and Mademoiselle Laurence undressing in resence of Madame de Jenfosse, and he tapped at the wlndow. lifadame de Jeufosse heard the tap and turned. After a while he again taLpped, and Madame de Jenfosse turned round sharply, but saw nothing. One night Guillot came to me in a violent passion and related tbat, Madame de Jeufosse being absent, he was that night to have been admitted to the chamber of Mademoiselle Blanobe, and that Blanche had taken the precantion of oiling the hinges of the door, but that just as he was about to enter Madame de Jeufosse had returned home." Witness added that he fully believed all that Gillot had told him. Another witness, named Augustin, deposed that Guillot had told him of his relations with Mademoiselle Blanche, that he was accustomed to meet her in the grounds of the chateau; that one night, fin order not to be heard, she had come out without her shoes, and that she had, after some hesitation, consented to receive him in her chamber. Witness added that GuiUot knew that he was in danger of being fired at in going into the grounds, and that he took his servant with him to convey bim home in the event of his being wounded. Sergeant Regade, of the 7th Hassars, deposed that he knew that GnUlot had clandestine meetings at night with Mademoiselle Blanche, and that more than once he had been in the grounds of the chabeau when they were together, One night he and Guilliot had been chasedhby the domestics. She had continued her intrigue even after the rupture of the two families, A farmer named Cartler and a gamekeeper named Caron, severally deposed that Guillot had told them of his intrigue with Mademoiselle Blancheo; that on one night he was to have been admit'ed to her chamber, but was baulked by the unexpected return of her mother; that sbe had often come out to maeet him without shoes. The latter witness added that, according to Guillot, it waS Mademoiselle Blancbe who had made the first advances. Several other witnesses deposed to similar declations having been made to them by Guillot. The Court then adjourned.

THE WESTERN BANK OF GLASGOW. ADJOURNED MEETING OF TRE ,TAPRR1T.T%I-DC The adjourned moeetilng-of the) shareholders was held, on 'Thursday, in the Trades.hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of receiving the report of the committ-ee appointed at the meet.. -lag of the 24 inat.,ito iuvestigate the atl'airs of the company. 'The meeting was not iao numerous as on the former occasion, there being apparenxtly about 300 shareholders present. 'The very disagreeable state of the w eather mnight account for the absence of many of the shareholders;- but possibly a greater Dumber absented themselv-es from the feeling that personal aittendance could not now inLfluence the fate of the Eank.A consideratble deputation was presenxt from Edinburgh, ancl individual shareholders attended from many of the country distrits. Mr. W. Ening, one of the shareholders, was called to the chair. On the platform we -observed Mr. A, Baird, Mr. W. Logie, Mr. T. D. Gr&lsamn Mr. J. Dunlop, dlirectors; M r. J. M'Clellad, Mr. R. 33Tyson, Mr. G. Bairtl. The secrtary having read the minaute of Last mreeting of the hank, The CHAflt3AN said-Gentlemnen, yout have now heard 'the minute of our last meeting, aoting upon which the commnittee that 'was appointed to act with the directors pro-ceeded Immediiately to go on with their very onerous bust mnes. The way in which we proc.eeded was this :-Betweou -the directors and the committee appointed there were nearly 20 gentlemen, aRl men o! business, all conneced more or less with the hank, all persons who had, a large stake, and intent on exrajnssing into ;he particuglar position of the bank, and reporting it to youL faithfully. This large committee, for the purpose of the better getting through with the work, was divided into five commuittees, the firt having the general mnanagement of the business, andl the other four being for the examination of the hooks an~l ac,counts. These were subdivided afterwards Into portionsI, for the purpose of getting through with the examination In timue to come before thLis meeting, andl I believe in all the casies the greatest attentloss has been paid to give you as faithful a view of tho state of the haun as possible. I ibelieve, however, that the investigators have taken a rather mnore gloomy view than I should have been incUlied to do, and Ioe thingwo' turn ouat worse than they have been. aftimated,"though,1I am sorry to say, that is badl enough. A report has been prepared, and will he submitted to yenx now when you wfil be able to 'udge for yourselves what the resut of the exalmintation has b~een. Mr. M'Lelan has been at great pains in drawing usp that report, and in hils examination of the assets of the bank, and he will now read It, so thatyou can judge for yourselves. Mr. M'LZLAl,, then rose and said-I will first read the report, and then give you an explanation as to the vidinsus rea,d at last meeting, and give you oar reasons for reducing the assets given in that vidimus in the way we do.

Thzey accordingly divided themselves Into dyve sub-cons. asittees, amonag whom were allocated posttons of the week to be done, and they assumed as memabers of committee, MIr.

As to the foundation of the report contained In this sheet, I will just read off the items as you heard them read before, and make any remark that ocours to me in stating the sums we have taken from the estimate of assets as appearing in last balance sheet. In the vidimus read at last meeting there was stated under the head of liabilities to the public bank-notes in ciroulation 720,0831. I havesatisfiedmyselfthatthisisacorrectsum,from the reports of the bank acconntants. Then there are deposits at head office 903,5961., and at branches 4,402,9731., in all 5,306,5GSI. These also are correctly stated, as appearsin the abstract of the ledger, the accounts of the company in this department, indeed, being so correctly kept that it was an easy matter to ascertain that. Then there were alluded to in that vidimus acceptances part due and current, exchange credits on account of home aud foreign customers part due current, obligations to accept, debts to other banks, promissory notes, bills colected on account of customers, or parted wlth for negotiation, balance due to sundry bankers' correspondents, bills of exohange rediscounted in London, and yet to become due, maklng the total sum 8,911,9321. As you will remark from the report which has just been read, the committee divided themselves into five parts. Each part took up a portion of the account as stated there The first part taken up was the statement in the assets of bals current, 4,343,0391. This was gone over with as much accuracy and minuteness as possible, eachitem,infact, inthe discount ledgers having a thorough examination made into it; and the estimate of the loss is 437,9451., so that we thus reduce the asset from 4,343,0391. to 3,900,5001. The balances on current accounts are stated at the head office in this vidimus to be 2,459,9691. and at branches, 1,192,4041.; making altogether 3,652,431. After a patient examination, the committee estimate the loss on this to bo 886,0571., leaving 2.766,3761. of assets. Next in the vidimus it is stated that the balances due by sundry bankers and the security held against bankers' acceptances on account of customers amount 919,5781. The committee consider that, on the first item of this, under the Glsgow letters of credit, and from recent information from New York, it will be necessary to make a deduction of 60,0001., leaving 8 59,5781. instead of the former sum. The property and furniture, the chief part of it at the branches, may be set down at the same sum as is stated In the former vidimus, 14S,0001. I dare say by arrangements with other bankers thls asset may be assumed as good. Debts In suspense are set down in last vidimns at 976,6401. ; the loss on this head, including protested bills, whicli we estimate at 685,5971., leaving an available asiet of 285,0431. The Government and other securities are set down at 93,4711., and I thought at first this was wholly a good security, but upon examination into the nature of them I found there were more than. Government securities, securlties for advances made to parties on railroads, and as the balance due by these partl6s does not represent the value of their interest in these railroads, we reduce this balance less 22,4731. The cash other than the company's notes, stated at 204,6611., consists of gold and other bankers' notes-the bllU stamps being to the extent of l, 1621. The value Of nolicles or insurance has been estimated at 70,0001., and the way in which this value has been ascertained was bY giving each office who had insured the number of the policy, and invOting from them a statement of the valueo at which they wotildtake it if handed over to them, and we added 9 per cent. for public estimation, and thus brought the amount up to 70,0001. The whole losses of the bank, as I have already stated, are thus made up to 2,020,5841. (Sensation.) The CHAIAuA.N.-You have now heard a detalled result of the investigation into the affairs of the bank. It certainly shows a very dismal account, A great part of the valuation of the assets must be a matter of opinion. I believe the investigators have made the valuation to the best of their judgment. I hope, however, they have taken a more gloomy view than they might have done. It is matter of hope that things will turn out better than they expect; but so munh will depend upon the state of the mercantile community, and so much on the management during tho liquidation, that It is impossible to say -whether the result will coincide with the statement laid beforo you. I hope it wll turn out better. I shall now be glad if any shareholders pesent wlll favour us wlth their observations on what they nae heard. A. S RstoLDEn.-I was merely going to put a uestion. I think it was stated at last meeting that 800,001. wouldcover the supposed loss. lathe l,200,0001. more lost In addition ? T1he Ca A N.,-The formerstatement said not loss than SMHA38E,OLDIB.-Thon the lossIs now 1,200,0001. more than that ? The CHAm32ax.-Yes. CaptainM'CO';xci&:ncWM you ailowme tomako a few remarba? Firhst, I would propose that we shiould vote our hearty thankcs to the committee who have,inavery laborious and srightforwardmns,nner,performed the very disagreeable duty that has been imposednupon thema. (Applause.) This commiitteewasselcoetdcontrary to the opinion of sromeatleast of the last meeting, buit it has not gone back fn the d uty that was asked of it-viz., that of forming au cstimatc upon all thle assets and liabilHties. They now come forward hers,, xnd, throvwing aside all feelings that might be engenxdered byteircormexion with Glasgow, boldly state to us that they consider our directors lhave treated us in a manner most unwairrantable. (Applause.) I am perfectly certain that they did right in abstaining from expressing any opinion as to their legal responsibility; but I urged at last meeting that we should have had some better data to go upon as to that which must be interesting to all. For we are able to see in the body of the directors a great mass of men -who, however little their own introtmisslons might have been with the actual assets of the bank, and however little persornal assisabnce they may have received, there can be no doubt, were able in their own private mercantile conicerns to do a great deal of benefit to themselves (applause), because they not only had to enter the market to selli their great staples of trade, dealing with maen of money and sound credit, and resting uponi their capital and character; but they were also able to raiise the market by going to men who were to be dealt with not only for their capital, but for their easily negotiated bills in the Western Bank. I do not say that of any of the directors, because I am too igno. raLnt of their position in the mercantile world; but I say this, that from what I have heard since I became a shareholder as to the credit of the Western Bank generally in Glasgow, anda that in Glasgow it was so well appreciated, I,cannot urderstand how men of the great realized capital they are said to be could have continued shareholders or so very doubtful a concern had they not some great benefit to themselvea in connexion with it. (IINo, no!I" from the platform.) This in only a theory of maine, and I may be wrong in saying it. Mr. M'CLEiiaN-.-It is a perfect theory, Captain M'Con.- nochie.I Captain M'Co,,rYocHrn.-I only stated it as a possibilty. I urged at the last meeting that we should have, at all events, some ~daa upon which we, as a body of share. holders, might be able to obtain legal advice as to the legal responsibility of the directors. (Applause.) I was then told that this would only interfere with the greater interest at stake, -which was that we should puxt our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavour to put the vessel right again. We see now thaat this, at all events, is impossible, for it has, alas l not only gone down in deep water, but I ama afraid it has stuck in theo deep quicksands at the bottom. Therefore, nxow I again urie t at we, as abody of shareholders, may obtain information befo-e the next meeting, and before we arc inx the depressed 'state of many of us, not kniowing where to turn for the maere necessaries of life, instead of being now buoyed up with a sort of hope given us that we are not quite 2,000,0001. in excess of capital. I urge now that we should appoint a committee, or, at all events, that we should ask- our late committee that has done so much for us, to turn their attention to this particular-as to what was the state of the hank's affairs in June last twelvensonth, when the directors not merely tacitly trusted to the maanagerment of the manager, but positively went to the overt act of increasing the dividend to 9 per cent., when in reality the bank was not inL a position to pay a dividend at all, I ask you not maerely as traders, but as independent meni, in the name of common sense, was that not a positive overt act enL the partb of the directors ? They had no right to take the mere statement of the manager on tbat point. They were the directors, and itlis certain that the dividend wras falsely increased to 9 percent., the increase belag taken out of capital contrary to the Act of Parliamaent for regolatlngjoint.stock banks, which dlstinetlystates that a divident isnot to be taken ontof the capital of a bank. Iwant this committee,with the assistance of Mr. h.t'CleUland, who has so ably conductedl the inquiry, to coniduct thin also, and brinig the mzatter before able counsel. At all events, let us be favoured, as a body of shareholders, with the opinion of able counsel as to whether we have got a lore. standi in urging in law couLrts some restitation of what we have lost. I myself have lost a small sum, as it might appear to you, though to myself it is unnecessary to say it will be a large sum, and I hold in may pocket the proxies of three ladles with, whom I am Intimately acquainited. These ladles were left by their father a certain sum, which enabled them to live In the -way they had always been brought up to, andI they are now left nerfectly destitute. That Is not a solitary case- it is the casi of many. Now, I urge that thin inquiry should be made for their sakes, and I f or one amn myself willing to give up any hopes I have zagainst the dlirectors, if we as a bodly could come to the determination of serving the directors, and among ouLrselves forming a committee (perhaps this may be considered *ttopian) to look after the InLterests of those unforttunate people, our fellow-shareholders, (Appla use.) We have raised large sums for the sufferers in India, and I ama quite certain that in all the sufferings in India there are not greater than those which will be the result of this failure of the Western Bank. It is with these feelings I would urge that this inquiry should be made, because I think if weIg to a jury we wfil do so with greater certainty, If we enlit the sympathies of the public by goiing forward as a body to inquire into the moatter, in comaing to the decision that the directors have wronged us, and that we are entitled to receive whatever they are able to give us in restitution of our loss through them. (Applause.) Ilwould, therefore, urge that this committee be asked, as a very deep obligation to us as a body of shareholders, to look into the state of affairs in June twelvemonths, when the directors increased the dividend, thus increasing the value of property at that time in the bank, lay the matter before counsel, and atall events receive his answer. It can do no harmn, I am certain. Men of business have said to me that they are against such a proposal, because they think it wil probably giv rie t anopiion amn our creditors, and ladtoth ginfeenc tha weardvie in our counsels. I cannot see this. We may be perfectly unanimous in the one object-- that of going along with the directors and the committee appointed for the totter management of what is to follow; but I do not see that it is necessary for the country to thinkc that we have gone along with them in what is past. I therefore urge the appoinLtment of such a comamittee as I have proposed very strongly. Mr. HEsDsRY.-I think this is altogether apart from the business for which we have muet to-day. Our first business in sincerely to thank the gentlemen appointed at last mneeting for bringing up such a clear and lucid account of the result of the examination, In the first place, therefore, I would miove that the gentlemen of the comamittee continiue to assist the directors, and that a vote of thanks be awardedl to them. In the second place, I think it Is perfectly evident that a call must be made upon the shareholders, and I think this meeting should not separate without giving a recommnendation to the effect that it should be early done. It Is perfectly evident that the sooner that Is done the better, as there are people hoer just now in the capacity of share. holders who mnay be away soon, As to the last spoaker's proposal, any manu so disposed may consult counsel, to see how far the directors are liable; but,'at a promiscuous meeting of shareholders like this, I think we are met for a different purpose. I clq not see any good. to be got by dividing us Into sections, and so hurting the great paramount interest. We are all responsible as shareholders, in the first instance, and the directors are responsible to us; that can be seen to after. (Hisses and applause). The CF[Arn)iAN here requested Captain M'Conuechie to put his motioni formally, which he did as follows:- " That the present committee be requeste to continuLe siding ass heretofore in the neoeesary investigation of the bank', affairs, and unite In suchi an effoit an may be deemaed at present desirable for the beat winding up of the bank; and that they ebonld also be requested to t,.rn thali attsniion to the btate of tiie hank', affair In June, 18i$, wbhen the directora sanctioned an Increase In the dividend to 9 per cent. and, with the assistance of Ma. M'Oielland, draw out a brief, to he laid before able counsei. and receive freom him an opinion as to whether the ahareholdera have a icns standi in endeavouring to obtain legal redress, and that the result he laid before next meeting." Mr. DkviD Ful.ON seconided the mnotion. A SHAEREOLDER propOSed, as an amendment, that the motion should be divided into two parts-the first, that the committee should continue their assistance in advising as to the heat mode to proceed in winding up the bank. The second part he considered entirely out of their way, and would therefore propose that it should be left out. Captain 'CON?rOCHIE.-I was told at last meeting that that was not the time for such a proposal; and, now, wil you tell me when it Is to be done -l-when are we, as a body of shareholde rs, anfully to come before the directors and state our determination to have redress from them? I can understand that there are certain reasons for putting it off, anda they occur to mayself. It Is said, but I cannot agree 'with it, that it might interfere with the great object, which la the best a svtem of liquidation. I think the best way of getting our lbquidatioru disposed of is to go to the Edinburgh banks, our principal creditors, and ask, " Whomn do you want as your liquidators?l" The Edinburgh banks we ought to ask, and take their opinion as to who should he the liquidatorm I do not see that this motion of mine Interferes with that. If I thouight so, I would( be the very last man to press it, because I see the necessity of an immediate wIndin)g up. The Act of Parliamient says, by aPplying to the court any day a liquidation can he ap. piointed. I heard yesterday, and was surprised to hear i,fromi a gentleman holding a high position as a law authority in Edinburgh that even the next meeting of the 30th of December could not appoint a liquidation, or deter. mine the winding up. I thoug'ht he was wrong at the time, and when I went home I looked at the Act, and found nothing in it to bear out such a statement, or anything to prevent us from winding up at once. But that is going from the point. I say, with all myheart and all my soul, that the great thing Is to get an immediate call, and I would not press my motion if I did not think it would not Interfere with that. I therefore urge again that, as a body of shareholders, we determine to get legal opinion. We know it must he a juytrial, and we aillknow it to beana element of a jury that Lthey arc swayed not only by their ina-ividuuil opinions, btut by those of the whole country. I ask if we are not likely to carry with us the sympathy of the whole country if our committee and legal adviser tell us by next meeting that we have a claim. If we have no claim, I would abandon the matter, and leave it to the individual liberality of the directors to relieve the bereaved widows and orphans who are left destitute by their remissness. The CMAIR3uyA.-There is a motion before ts nov by Captain M'Connoohie, and an amendment is moved. I propose we should lay them before the meeting, and take Its sense first on the amendment. Captain M'CoN\o=-S ome parties hero say they would support me if one point Is left out. These gentlemen proposo that that point referring to the opinion of counsel eing taken be left out; and I am sure, if the motlon would otherwise be carried, I would leave that out, because Mtr. M'Cleland and the committee are quite able to form an opinion as to that. I am quite con2dent that Mr. 'Clel. land will give us a correct opinion, and therefore I am quite willing to Ilave out the reference to Edinburgh counsel. Mr. 'CLELLND.-It appears to me that Captain M'Conochle's views may be carried out in a much more simple way than he proposes. An inquiry into the state of the bank's affairs in 1856 would imply the same amount of labour which has been gone over by the committee and myself for the last fortnight-three gentlemen five or six hours a day, and myself twelve or fourteen hours a-day to get this report brought up. This statement is before the publio and the shareholders, as to the present situation of the bank. It shows bad enough, it ray show better in 1856, and if Captain M'Connochle or any gentleman* wiUtake the report and statement I hold I my hand, and go to the counsel with them, and state their facts, they wil get their opinion upon that statement, without reference to an inqui In 1856 which would serve the end entirely. As to making any demand on the directors, this is entirely premature. We have a solemn duty to pcerform we are owiag mlllions to the public, and we must pay the debt-remeuiher, all of it. Every shareholder wvill need to put his shoulder to the wheel for the next two years to llquidate the ascets and pay our debts. Then there may come to be man inquiry into the modeln whichthe directors have acted. At Iprosent we n ust do our duty to the public and pay our debts. (Ap One or two observations have beea made since the discussion commenced which would make it desrabe Ishold xplinwith regar-d to the liquidati on ropsedythedirecptloarsand the committe jointly. What theve sy hbears entirely on the question before te eetig,-to coiprehend more fully the desiraleness of adopting either the motion or amend- mcent.y amd inot^a shaeholdrer ; I speak entirely as the * rcenlycaledIn awagent of the company, and I have only to explain facts and say nothing about matters of opinion. The information which Captain M'Connochie received in Edinburggh In regard to the Act was perfectly correct. It is not at first obvious in reading the Act that that is its meaning, and I am not much astonished that he did n,ot Ree that such was its meaning. Immediately af ter the sesolution on the part of the d&iretors and committee to wind up and take measures towards that, and aninouncement of the meeting for the 30th of December, with the irntention of not losing any time, because it required 30 days' notice, they resolved to consult couLnsel upon avariety of points-- among others, npon that very point whether a seocond meeting was required or not. Immediately the Dean o Faculty and Mr. Patten were consulted on that point, and they have given us a very distinct opinion that a second meeting is required at an intervaLl of a montth. This is the procedure necessary in order to appoint a voltmtary liquidator. In the adoption of the one alternative or the other which the Act allows, of akppointing an official liquidator as compared with a voluntary liquidator, there are varsous advantages which appear to attach to the one courae of proceeding. The great advantage of a voluntary liqunidation is the rapidity with which he may be appointed, which is chiefly valuable because of the rapidity with which he can mdake calis. Io is not entitled to apply to the Court to make a cau as in the oase of the judicial liquidator. Tve latter does not hiraself mke a call, bnt applies to the Court to make it, and the Court, after they have information laid before them, as thoy think desirable make the call, What degree ofInformation they woulld ak-whether they would rely upon the balance such as we can giv'e them now, or await for a formal balance, or how far the bolydays, wbich occur at the end of this mouth aud last till the middle of January, would interfere with the judicial investigator and the call are matters for serious consideration. The appointment, on the other hand, of a voluntary liquidator has a great many advantages. Among others, the voluntary llquidator can himself make the c.LU, without going to the Court at all, obviating, therefore, the necessity of preparing and laying the statements before the Court. Again, the voluntary liquidator has in these circumstances all the power of a judicial lioqidator, and bas a right to the exercise of these powers without any reference to the Court, whereas the judicial liquidator is bound in every case to go back to the Court and ask their sanction to the exercise of that power, Ile can exercise no power without the sanction of the Court, and a nice ques- I tion arises how far it could be expected to give this sanction by a general order, or how far It would require the judicial liquidator to go back to it from time to time. It was, therefore, (Mr. Bannatyne continued), resolved by the directors and committee to recommend voluntary in preference to judicial liquidation. As to the appointment of the liquidators, it was proposed that these should not be appointed without the sanction of the Edinburgh banks, these liquidators numbering four, including a handsomely paid gentleman residing constantlyin Glasgow, who should be recommended by his experience in mercantile matters and knowledge of the debtors of the bank. Oaptain M'CoN-NocUr thought It would be much better that this course should be agreed to by a general meeting of the shareholders than that it should be followed at a great disadvantage by individual shareholders. Mr. WALLACB, Auchinvale, seconded Mr. Henry's amendment. He said he had listened very attentively to what had fallen from Captain M'Connochie, but could not go into his proposal-in the first place, because he could not tel what might be Its ultimate result; and, in the next lace, because he found himself without money to pay for fegal advice. It was an easy thing to get an opinion from counsel, but it wras a very different and often a very difficult thing to realize the Ideas of counseL He would take good care to kcep himself out of Captain 'Connocbie's coi- A SnAmElroLDPj.-Would Mr. Fleming be k-ind enough to say whether the balance in June, 1856, was a mere balance of the books, without reference to the character of the securities, and if it was in that way that a dividend of 9 per cent, was declared? Mr. FLEs3zG.-The first time I saw a balance of the affaira was in July, 1857. Since October, when Mr. Taylo i left, I had the balance-sheet of 1856 put into myjhands. There is no doubt in the world, from the investigation comrpleted by Mr. M Clelland, that a very large amount of debts in suspense were then valued and not written off. (Ia answer to a further question from a shareholder, Mr. Fleming added),-He could not point to any special case in which a debt had been wholly exhausted, but he rather thought he should be safe in saying that debts which were exhausted prior to the balance of 1856 were carried forward at that date. (Hear, hear.) He ought to explain that at the balance of 1857 there was written off, of bad debts then inexistence, 147,0001. Captain M'COmNocniz.-It is well that this should come before the country that the directors took office and kept office, carrying on business with bad paper as securities. i (Loud cries of " Hear, hear," and applause.) It is well that it should go to the country that it was not the Bank Charter Act, or anything of that sort, which had brought about this catastrophe, but the reckless and disgraceful wav in which the directors had conducted the affairs of the bank. Mr. BLACKADDIm (Edinburgh) said he would be glad to support this motion of Captain M'Connochie's at another time, for it was plain that the 9 per ceut. dividend should not have been declared. But the shareholders were at present in a position requiring them to attend, in the first place, to something else. If he could get anything from the directors he should be very well pleased, and so would they all; but in the meantime it would be better to avoid a division, if possible. He hoped Captain M'Connochie would withdraw his motion, and let them proceed in the first place to talke steps for liquidating the debt. (Cries of "Vote, vote.") Mr. B ANATYNX wished the meeting to bear in mind that this was not a regular meeting of the company under their act, but an adjournment of a meeting held for a s e- cial purpose. At the last meeting, held for that speclal purpose, the directors said, after the regular business of the meeting was over, that in the circumstances they would be glad to remain and dlscuss matters with them. This is an adjournment of that meeting, and no minute can be taken of this meeting to go upon the records of the company. A resolution passed just now may therefore be quite good and proper, but it will not in any shape bind the company. I would suggest to Captain M'Connochle that he should eithet change his motion into one for holding a meeting of the company to take this matter into consideration, or adopt some other way of carrying out his object. If the resolution is passed Just now one question which will arise is about the expense, for the company will not be bound for it. Captain M'CoNNsociEg said he would withdraw that part of his motion which involved legal expense ; but surely they might hope for some information about this overt act of declaring a 9 per cent, dividend in 1856. After some further remarrks, Captain M'Connochle submitted his motion as before, the latter part of it now simply requesting the committee to turn their attention to the state of the bank's affairs in June, 1856, when the directors sanctioned a dividend of 9 per cent., and to report to a meeting to be held half an hour after the general meeting on the 30th inst. The CHAIR3MN then put the amendment and the motion to the meeting, and declared his inability to decide which was carried. HoI thought, however, that the amend. ment was carried. Captain M'CoNxiocm.-Directors aro requested to keep down their hands. (Laughter.) The CurAIRMY took another show of hands, and saidThey are very close upon it. I think the motion is carrled; but if any one proposes a scrutiny. we can divide and go into the other room. Mr. HENRY thought there slhould ba a scrutiny, and thought it of importance that the shareholders should know that they were virtually voting that they had no confidence in the directors. The CHnUAnsm-I feel also that the committee, which has hitherto been acting with the directors, wiU hardly undertake the duties to be required of them. A SHAREMOLDER.-Are we to understand that this 300,0001. is the utmost we can be called upon to pay up? Mr. BANNiATYNE.-The caU will not be a caU for the actual loss, after that loss has been ascertained, but a call by the liquidator umder the Act to meet the liabilities of the company. Half a million, or even a million may be caled for; but whatever Is not ultimately required will be Another SinIEHOLDIB.-Can the note circulation be preserved ? The CnArmsAs,.-It is impossible to say. We cannot enter upon that just now; dnce Captain M'Connochie's motion has been carried, it wiU be necessary that the committee, which has hitherto acted with the directors, should receive largerpower; and it 'will be for them afterwards to consider whether they can carry out what is wanted. A S nxssorDxs,n.-1 seems to me perfectly plain that those who have become shareholders since June, 1856, are the only persons who have an interest in the-inquiry proposed by Captain MI'Connoshie, and it cannot, therefore, be expected that the general body of the shareholders should ne parties to a request to the committee to go intO this further investigation. If the directors were to express their willingness to allow any accountant appointed by these shareholders to have access to the books to prepare a brlef for the opinion of counsel, this would not compromise the other shareholders. Another Saxo5tEoLnDi road a paper, which set out by picturing cases of pecular hardship which must occar among many of the shareholders, and ended by a proposal that t e directors, as men of wealth and Christian principle, should form themselves into a committeo for searching out and relieving oases of peculiar distres among the share. holders. If this were done, he would heartily forgive them all they had done, so far as he was concerned, and would regard their confession of shortcoming as sincere. The CBAIRMNAN.-We caunot enter into appeals to the benevolence of the directors. A motion has been carrled for inquiry. The committee previously appointed has exhausted its powers, and Captain ArConnoohle would now require to propose that they obtain additional Powers. Captain M'CONNocHrE.-What additional powers do yoa want ? The meeting has given you all the powers you noed by agreeing to this motion. Do you mean to say that yon are disinclined to give the information, because the inquiry would be of a delcate mature? Mr. MOCLELLAnD.-The difficulty is this: I am afraid that it is impossible to make the inquiries you want, and report in a fortnight, There are a great many things to attend to in the management of the company, of great importance to your interests, especlaly the looking after an enormous numberof assets, which must be done even before the liquidators are appointed. That must be attended to, day after day, and occupies every hour of our time. Captain M'CoNNocErm.-Then, if ten gentlemen wlU joln mne, |ldll pay my share of the payment of another account- Mr. FLY UNG,.-Will you permit me one word with roEer. ence to the management of the general businers of tbh barn ? This is a very rerious matter, and ene of infint^l1y greater importance than thlis otlmor question, The q'iesiisn I wish to put is this-How is tho business of the I West=rn Bank to be carried on? Ia the position of aanager, I insst have some one to advise wLth. I corceive, after the proceedings of this day, the old directors witl feel an atnount of hesitation in coontinuing to work with sue, as manager of the hank, seeing they have completely lost the confidence of the body of the sharebolders. It is necessary, therefore, to consider who are to take their place if they resign, for the ordinary business of the bank must be crriedon Then,inwatpostionrt aI? I should be glad to be relieved from the position In which I stand, and shell bedolightedif another manager is appointed; but so long as I am ir this pogition I most be allowed to ask with whom I am to consult, for I caslnot carry on the busa ness of the bank on my own responsibility. I apprehend the powers to which the chairman alludes are powers of such aonfdes ri tinc as wi llr ena e thep directors, before vacaptngtheir once, tappoiere not others nltheifr ace, defor utider th acvideo ci n ery 18 .

The same SnARMlOLDlEPL-WO mnust be aware first that the present direcetrs will not act. Mr. FLE loNG.-Under the contract of copartvery no meeting of shareholders can be held without 20 days' notice, and in what position shall I be placed if the direc. ftors decline to act? Captain in'Cowscinm-You imagine a contingeuo y that is scarcely credable, that they should get us into such a ms and then leave os in it. Mr. HExiRY.-s would move that the meeting declare their confidence in the present directors, -who were appointed in 1857, and were not to blame for the declaration of dividend in 1856. That is the only way to get us out of this dilemma. wiUhat has Captaai t?Connoolije done with his motion bh t thrown us all inxto confuasion? Captain Mwe'Coocur .-I mean to say these gentlemen, the directors, cannot leave us; thoy cannot wak thle streets of Glasgow, or look any one in the face, i they leave us-it is not possible. bar. B ATYNE.- may be allowed to say, as law adviser of the company, recently, cmvled in, that I feel we a-re getting Into a mess. (Hear, hear.) I think the great object of thismreeting was to inform you of the state of the attairs of the company. That object has been sadmirably accomplished by the report read to you. Beyond that, legally speaking, this meeting was not entitled to takce action, anu I a ay thtif this spirit of hostilty by one section of thepsharehoers against the directors goes on, the resutlt wir be that I shall b asked by the manager to apply to the Court of Session for the appointment of factor, which will be a catastrophe fatal to your interests. Seeing that a motion for inquiry was carried, a scrutiny was asked for too lateo; It wil be for the committee to in- sur whether they can proceed. But do not let us go ~urther in that airection so as to neessitate a total cessation of the affairs of the bankc. Any one called to Bit in the bank from day to day, and disouss the questions which are continuall_y arising, may fancy what would be the result if that were to cease to-morrow. It would be ruinous to your assets. (Hear, hear.) I beseech the meeting, therefore, to unanumously, express their anxiety, and request that the directors shouldl continue to act, anda that faUl power be given to the committee to supplement their own number, in which case we may be able to go on in the meantime. (Applause.) Mr. M'LA,Y.-I move to that effect. Mr. ComIiti-And I second the mnotion. This motion was then carried by acclamation; and after a vot-e of thanks to the Chairman the meeting separated.

LONDON, SATURDAY, DEOBMBBR 19, 1857. We preent our readers this morning with a comlmunication which, though of considerable length and rather professional character, is so entertainingly written, and so replete with valuable information concering India and its inhabitants, that an attentive perusal of its contents will be riebly rewarded. It presumes, indeed, as was almost unavoidable, a certain preliminary knowledge of the subject, but recent eveant and discussions have so familiarized the public with Indian affairs that this condition is no longer so formidable as it used to be. After saying this much, however, in praise of " A Soia,=R! and his I disquisition, we must needs observe that, in our opinion, he entirely begs the main question at issue, and discusses the reconstruction of the native ermy not only without proving that such a force ought to be reconstructed, but actaally while offering a good deal of undesigaed and incidental evidence to the very opposite effece. Let the reader only remark the premisses from which our correspondent starts. He assumes that the European Army in India will be doubled, or nearly so, and that instead of 40,000 troops in the three Presidencies we shall for the future have 70,000 or 80,000-a pretty solid beginning, considering what a third of this number have shown themselves capable of doing during the last six months; Next, he reckons upon local corps to discharge the duties of police, observing, with great truth, that such services are usually detrimental to the discipline of regular troops, whereas they can be performed very sufficiently by a species of constabulary, which would be a good support to Government all the while. Finally, he suggests that the profession of Christianity in India should command some such recognition as Lord EximBoRouGH desired for British blood; that the Church, under the circumstances of the case, should be rendered literally militant, and that a Christian Militia, embracing all races of that faith, should be organized 'wherever the materials were discoverable. This may appear, perhaps, not a very productive souree of recruits, but the element is not altogather insignificant, and is likely, we trust, to expand. In the South of India Christian congregations are Eomewhat numerous, and their establishments ancient enough to command Oriental respect. We may hope, too, both that European settlers in India will now be multiplied, and that true pacific conversion may make greater progress. Now, after providing this powerful European army, after allowing for a local police, and after reckoning upon a Christian Militia, our correspondent still discusses the reorganization of " a native " army," and so earnestly, too, that ho Is at his wites end to find suffrcient materials. He gives us Sikhs, Affghans, Ghoorkas, Bheels, Santals, and all the odd tribes and races which religion, migration, eonquest, or oppression has contributed to form. He goes off into the Indian Archipelago and conscribes Malays, Dyaks, Arabs, and Asiaties of all descriptions. Hle speculates about Burmah and Siam, and wonders whether there maay not be some available levies somewhere in that peninsula. Yet, after all this, and after suniring up the aggregate resources of all the regions from the Hindoo Koosh to the China Sea, he positively drops to the concluision that we shall still not have enough, and that we must come round to our old Ilindostanee Sepoy again, though in smaller force, and with far greater precautions. We just beg leave to ask, why this additional " native army" Is wanted at all? 'What Is it to be raised for? 'What is it to do ? To throw a serviceable light on these questions we all invoke the testimony of our correspondent himself, as conveyed in his own words. For the internal protection and management of India there is literally scarcely a demand for any troops at all; certainly not after we have provided a sufficient police and established a strong European force in reserve. We have no enemies wbatever in India, every native State being reduced to dependence, and all having now shown that under the greatest temptations thoy cannot be induced to forsake our sovereignty for any other. The native Princes, as our correspondent writes, " have been almost universally faithful," and if they have been faithful now they are in no degree likely to become faithless hereafter, The people, as we have seen, are utterly indifferent to the designs of the rebels, and the only dangerous element in all India was, in point of fact, that very Sepoy Army which we maintained with the idea of keeping danger aloof. We have so repeatedly affirmed this of our own authority, and we regard the fact as so supremely important in determining our future policy, that we particularly ask the reader's attention to the words of one who, " A SoLDiER?' himself, and writing from the very base of our present operations, gives the most conclusive confirmation of the views we have taken. "I think," says he, " it is pretty clear that if, in. "stead of fighting us on our own soil, the Sepoys "had gone over to the Emperor of CHINA we "might possibly have maintained our civil govern"ment even with the small number of Europeans "we now have." In other words, we had no imaginable adversaries but the Sepoys themselves, and if this "native army" could but have been whisked away by some siroke of magic to the other side of the Himalayas we should have had nobody to fight with, and plenty of troops to carry on the government withal. Why, then, brlng this unique and uselems element of mischief on the scene again ? Just the same may be said of our border neighbcurs. Nepaul, which in the eyes of even cooljudging Indian statesmen was to pour its hordes from the hills into the plains at the first symptom of weakness on the part of our Government, has indeed descended from its mountains, but only to our assistance against our own " protectors." A$ghanistan has done likevise. The turbulent and predatory tribes of the North-Westernm border accepted with alacrity the invitations of EDWAARDES and his colleagues, took service under our flag, ai-d have loyally aided us in subduing our own c; native army" on the bank-s of the Ganges. Where, then, are we t: find enemies or occupation for all the levies which our correspondent enumerates? He himself has confessed and admitted that the " civil govern" ment" of India-that is to say, the whole government of the country, apart from external wars, could be carried on by the ald simply of a European army some 30,000 strong. To this he proposes to add as many more, also an effective constabulary, also a Christian Militia, and yet, after aU, asks for a "native army" besides ! We cannot detect even the anticipation of an occasion for the use of this force, except in the remark that " if India ever is invaded it will " probab]y be from the Affghan side and by the aid " of Affghan auxiliaries"-a speculation which points to the old alarm of Russian aggression. That aggression, however, if it takes place at all, will certainly not take place on a sudden, and with a good system of steam transports we shall be as near Bombay as anybody. We trust the institution of a " native army" may never be seen again in Hindostan. The title of " army" should be given to that dominant force of Europeans which our correspondent assumes, and in it should be merged the auxiliary levies, which it will, of course, be desirable to maintain. What excellent service such levies may render we have lately seen, and the fidelity of the Punjabee and Ghoorka troops well deserves a permanent recognition. But we need not talk about "a native " army." Our correspondent himself speaks of knocking off some 100,000 natives from our old scale of establishments, and if those we retain are 'weU selected and organized they would only feel it a higher compliment to be identified with the real Indian Army, irstead of being coullected with fifty other discordant elements into a force apart. With the genuine old Hindostanee Sepoy we must have no more to do. No doubt, he was very respectful, well conducted, as " A SOLDER" amusingly explain, even to a fault, docile in his drill, and generally personable; but as a fighting man he had ceased to be reliable, whereas for treachery and murder he had no equal. In a few words, we have all learnt, and our correspondent admits, that " a native army," though not required for the protection of India, is all but sufficient for its destruction, and we do not think that any apprehension of enemies from without is enough to warrant us in keeping such a mass of combustibles at home.
It requires no great foresight to perceive that a great contest is approaching on the subject of Slavery and the Slave Trade. The battle of the Negro will have to be fought by the philanthropists with a great diminution of prestige, the result of falsified predictions and blasted hopes. The BROUGRAMS and WmnEnronoES of the present day will have to adopt a somewhat humbled tone. The naniifeBtoes of Exeter-hall must for once ba defensive and apologetic, for the world is now wiser than when pulpit and platformn resounded with indignant appeals to humanity five-andtwenty years ago. The touching descriptions of philanthropic novel writers will go for little now as far as regards our own colonies. Those who are old enough may recollect the traditional portraits of West India proprietors, their wives and children, which are to be found in the "moral tales" of the last generation. The owner of a Jamaica property was always lying on a sofa, drinking sangaree and swearing at SA&so, a fine mulatto youth, whose quivering lips and flashing eye told how much he felt. The lady of the house, always represented as a faded beauty with her brow wreathed with pearls, was, of courae, being fanned by two female slaves, whose delicate forms bore recent traces of the lash. The youfhfil heir wandered about the house exercising a whip given him by his mother expressly to beat the little Negroes with. A faithful and pious PoNxz, exposed to every kind of ill-usage bemuse DniAr, who loved himoh, how fervently !-would not listen to the unmanly proposals of DnivB, the overseer, completed the picture. By such' representations as these a body of as hardworking and loyal subjects as England ever possessed were held up to obloquy, and Negro emancipation was effected without regard to the interests of men who were popularly supposed to be revelling in illgotten gains. But politicians and the public, and even the friends of the slaves themselves, have now begun to see matters in a clearer light. Our own colonies are impoverished, but the sum of slavery is not diminished; it has only been transferred from us to more grasping, pitiless, and unscrupulous hands. Never was the prospect of emancipation more distant than now that foreign slaveowners are establishing a monopoly of all the great staples of tropical produce. The islands which in the old times supplied so much sugar, coffee, and cotton are going out of cultivation, while Cuba, the United States, and Brazil are every day extending the area of their cultivation and the number of their slaves. So valuable, indeed, is the slave in Cuba that, in spite of treaties and penal laws, cruisers and blockades, thousands of Africans are yearly carried across the Atlantic to work on the sugar and tobacco plantations. The wealth of the island is such that, in spite of misgovernment, oppressive taxes, and a Spanish army of 25,000 men, its proprietors are among the richest in the world. As to the TJnited States, it is, indeed, folly to expect any change in that quarter. Slavery on the North American continent has extended, is extending, will extend. As long as the supplies of cotton are below the demand in all the markets of the world so long will slave labour be too valuable to be parted -with. Even the Northern Slave States, which but a few years ago were discussing the gradual abandonment of the system, are now silent about abolition, immediate or prospective. Their slaves are at present a great, perhaps their greatest source of wealth. If they cannot cultivate their own lands they breed Negroes to supply the new plantations in the South. It may be declared that the attacks of Abolitionists and the interference of the North are the cause of this determination to uphold slavery; but no sensible man will believe that mere irritation and obstinacy could lead to such great results. The existence of slavery is an economical question, and so long as the system is profitable we cannot doubt that it will be maintained. Much the sarne may be said with respect to Brazil, where the institution prevails with features of cruelty unknown even in the worst of times under English rule. Now, to thles countries we have given a monopoly of products which are the chief basis of our industry or among the chief sources of our revenue. They are becoming rich, powerful, arrogant, every day less inclined to be guided by English counsels or moved by English interference. With all the readiness which self-interest induces they have learnt the arguments against limiting slavery and slave importation, from our mishaps, our acknowledgments of failure, from their own prosperity, and from our dependence upon them. They have the law of nations on their side, and may quote it in answer to any assertion of our rights to interfere in the cause of humanity. They are free nations and Africa is a free coast. Negroes are necessary to raise the cotton, sugar, coffee, and tobacco which the world wants. The white man cannot work under a tropical sun, and unless the African be used as a labourer the fairest regions of the Now World must remain a desert. In fine, Negroes must behad at any co0t, and no nation has a right to impose its own scrupulosity on other free communities. If England has rained her own colonies that is no reason why she should seek to check the progress of the whole American continent. Such is the kind of reasoning which is becoming more and more common every day; and we may depend upon it that in some form or under some pretext the slaveowners of the other hemisphere will again attempt to obtain a supply of Negroes from the coast of Africa. The recent importation into the French colonies has naturally roused their attention, and it is no wonder that we hear it asked why a few cargoes of such " emigrants" could not be bronght to New Orleans or Savannah, there to be settled according to the domestic insti. tutions of the State. With this renewed vitality of slavery, owing to the rapidly increasing value of the slave, we have now to deal. And it is not by preaching, or protesting, or threatening, or denouncing, that the objects of humanity can be attained. The last generation were content to be merely destrmctives; they broke down the Slave system in the West Indics without attempting to replace it by a better, and the consequence has been the multiplication of the former evils, and a deepening of the guilt, in which we indirectly participate as consumers of the slave-raised produce. After 20 years' experience we are now called upon to provide a remedy. On all sides we bear the same cry,-the colonies are perishing for want ef suffeient labour. By additional supplies alore can the principle of free labour in the tropics le vindicated and a real blow struck at the iniquiti. s against which we have so long declaimed. Ot r attention has been directed to a report of the Council on Immigration for the Island of Trinidad, which shows how a British colony may decay while aU around it is flomrishing. If Trinidad had remained under Spanish sway, it nmight, in spite of tyranny and niirule, be the wealthy island which its position and fertility would naturally make it. But we learn that although the island contains 1,250,000 acres, yet the extent of all the land now under cultivation is only about 52,807 acres, and of this area the sugar plantations cover only 34,059 acres. The entire nuraber of agricultural labourers working for wages in the cultivation of sugar and cocoa is only 14,000, of whom nearly 8,000 are immigrants from India and China, introduced at the public expense. It is found that these are by far better labourers for wages than the Negro, who, it is stated, "will not be " stimulated to greater industry by any increase of " wages." And at the present time the planters would gladly obtain labour by an advance of wages. The high price of sugar and other tropical productions has stimulated enterprise, a greater extent of land is being brought under cultivation and all that is wanted for the development of the colony is a supply of hands. Such are the fertility and the abundance of land that "the expense " of establishing on virgin land an eatate "capable of producing 250 hogabeads of sugar, "including the cost of machinery and buildings, "would not exceed 6,0001. sterling.'; But with the present supply of labour even the present rroduction of the colony cannot be kept up. The colonists therefore beg the Government to assist them in obtaining immigrants from China and India. The colony, says the report, could. "without difficulty meet the expense of intro"ducing and without risk find employment for "500 Chinese inmigrants." But it is to British India that the colony chiefly looks. Ulnder a free system the Coolies work better than Africans. The former are ambitious and work for wages; the latter go off and squat in remote districts, content to support life on a little. Now this document comes, we think, opportunely at present. Tiere can be no doubt that slavery will once more gain the ascendant unless we carry out a plan of free labour. Our colonies in the West are the field for such a Bcheme, our empire in the East may furnish the labourers, and the new hold we shall have on Asia will give facilities for doing what we wish. Whether we should send mutinous Sepoys across the water is a matter hardly yet ripe for decision; but we think, if they are to be transported anywhere, they may as well people Tri-nidad as the Andamans or any Asiatic island. But it is evident that the vhole question of West Indian cultivation must now be examined, and with such colonies as Jamaica, Trinidad, and Guiana, there is no reason why we should not show that the culture of the Tropics by free labour is not the impossibillty which the partisans of savery represent.
In a return which has just been published of the weelkly sums allowed during the last five years for the maintenance of those pauper lunatics in Scotland who are exempted from confinement, we hope that we see one of the last rags of a barbarisra which has passed away for ever. We trust that the Act which last session received the sanction of the Legislature, and provided for the proper treatment and maintenance of lunatics in Scotland, will prevent,as far as any Act of Parliament can, a recurrenceof those enormities which early in the present year the report of the Scottish Lunacy Commission brought to light. But, without venturing to doubt the value of that measure, it is well also to remember that its success must depend not less on the vigilance of officials than on the interest which the Scottish public take in it; and we do think that the facts published in the present return exhibit an amount of ignorance, of cruelty, and penuriousness on the part of Scotemnen that is indeed astounding. It seems like a mockery to give to a pauper lunatic a weekly allowance of 4id. or 6ic. Sometimes the allowance is increased to four or five shillings, and there in one instance in which it is stated at 17s. 6d.; but the usual dole is from one shilling up to three. By way of making up for the smallness of the pecuniary allowances other assistance is given in a few instances. Hlere a man gets a shilling " and one peck of " meal ;" there another gets Ild. "and a house ;" a third gets 2s. 6d. "and clothes provided ;" a fourth gets 2s. 6d., "with clothes and shoes," which seems to imply that those for whom clothes alone are provided are allowed to go barefooted; In one case there is a fine distinction observed as to the precise items of clothing which are to be eupplied,-the poor man, in addition to his allowance of Is., has " bed and body clothes and thoes pro" vided." Sometimes the Decuniary grant is withheld altogether, and we find against certain nanes such an entry as this-" Clothing only supplied by "the Board; gets his board for his work as a " farm servant." Or, there is the case of a girl who gets nothing whatever-" no special allow" ance, but her father's allowance increazed on her " account." There are actually cases in which the patient is so ill as to require attendance, and for whom a nurse is provided, while the whole weekly allowance which the nurse is permitted to spend for the lunatic is 2s. 6d. In glancing one's eye over such a list, it seems almost a relief to find that in a considerable number of cases the lunatics are received into the poorhouse. Their treatment as mere paupers in the poorhouse, although in itself most unsuitable to their condition, is at least a slade or two better than the cruelty involved in farming them out to contractors for a few pence, from which they expect to make some profit, however little. The LORD-ADvocATE, declared, in the debate on the second reading of his Lunatics Bill, that the Board of Supervision spend three or four hours a-week in considering applications for increased allowances ; that no part of their duty is discharged more ably than this; and that, though the idea is prevalent that the allowances are a great deal too low, he should be very sorry to commit himnself to that opinion, as it would be improper to judge of the habits and the wants of the lower orders in Scotland from the habits and the necessities of the similar class in England. It is such a statement, coming from the very author of the Lunatics Bill, and made in the speech in which he proposed its second reading, that compels us to call attention to the actual returns. Even if we take the most favourable view as to the position of those lunatics who are exempted from confinement, and who receive these paltry pittances--if we suppose that in cextain cases they are under the care of relatives, and that while the ratepayers advance so much, or rather so little, for their support, friends provide the rest-the system is utterly indefensible. What is the sort of fare 'which a lunatic receives in a pauper family happy to get 41d. or 6 d. a-week for his maintenance? It must be of the most stinted kind, and stinted nourishment is the deatruction of the lunatic. Under the oldbarbarous style of treatment, indeed, which relied on bread and water and starvation, this fare would be considered most appropriate; but now about the most potent cure for the mysterious maladies of the brain is a diet that is generous without exciting, and the offer of 4Ad. for the mainteDance of a lunatic is but an offer to maintain and confirm his lunacy. From another point of view, also, the paltry assistance furnished in such eases by the Poor Law officer will appear culpable in the e.xtreme. Is there to be no surveillance of the insane ? Every traveller in Scotland must have been struck with the number of lunatics who are at large1 and who may be found now in the streets followed ia full ery by a troop of boys, now in some churcoh devoutly singing at the height of the voice and rmuttering incessantly, now suddenly starting.up like a fiend in some moorland solitude. And what is the consequence of not properly looking after these unhappy wretches ? What does the country gain. by starving its pauper lunatics on a miserable groat a-week ? It gains a family of imbeciles. It is well known in what a promiscuous way large numbers of the lower classes live,-how many beds in a room, how many sleepers in a bed, and how men and women huddle together without the slightest sense of decency. The consequence we find in our reports asto the number of idiot mothers-a number that is concealed as much as possible, in order to screen from just punishment those who permitted such a wrong. In one small parish in the North of Scotland there were not less than five of such imbecile women who had become mothers when the Commissioners were making their inquiries. It thus happens that to save the allowance of one imbecile the country is endowed with a family of imbeciles. But the worat of it is, that by such niggardly allowances the: pauper lunatics are subjected to the most terrible and loathsome treatment. We bad hoped that the old method of treating madness, which was as horrible in its details as the most cruel system of penal discipline which has yet been invented, had, at least in this country, been almost wholly abolished. All disease is more or less penal, and in many cases the remedy also comes to us with the penal touch,-it is a sharp knime,or a bitter draught, or a forced imprisonrment. But the pains of disease and the unpleasantnes3 of the remedy are in most cases mitigated by the soothing of friends and all the comforts which it is in their power to supply. To the lunatic alone under the exploded system was this mitigation of suffering denied; he was subjected to a physical restraint and to a lowering diet, that only served to develope his malady, and when he had worn out the resources of those who loved him best he was consigned to a gloomy madhouse, which was literaUy a hell upon earth, while it was the severest trial to those who cared for him to know that in committing him to this frightful abode they gave him up to indescribe.ble torments, which were to end only with his life. The report of the Scottish Lunacy Commissioners proved to theworldtha " this inhuman system stiU retains its vitality in the northern part of the island. By day oppressed with fetters and manacles, by night lying naked three or four in a bed of straw without covering of any kind, roling in filth and starved to desperation, the poor wretches, who, in their helplessness, had passed into the hands of men whose only object was to keep them as cheaply and as long as possible, led a life in comparison with which that of a well-fed pig in a sty seems a sort of paradisaical existence. Such ignominious treatment is but the natural result of penurious payment and imperfect supervision. It is surely evident, on every ground of expediency aud humanity, that the system should be reversed and the allowances largely increased; and it may help to show the immense importance of regarding this class of the community with no niggardly wisdom if we state a fact which may not be generally known. The total number of lunatics in Scotland is 7,403, and of this number 3,904 are paupers. What does this mean? It means that the pauper population of Scotland supply maore than half the total number of lunatics in the kingdom. There is a direct connexion between pauperism and lunacy. Poverty and mania act and react on each other, and it is at once a cruel system and a false economy which could lead the Poor Law Board. to reduce to a mini1mutm the amount of relief afforded to a pauper lunatic. It has been one of the theories of the Poor Law Board-understood, if not boldly expressed-that pauper relief should be rendered as disagreeable as possible, in order that no one may apply for it except in cases of extreme need; and, if we may judge from the return before us, it is pretty evident that a similar saystem has been extended to lunatics, without the officials perceiving the distinction between poverty and disease. After the report of the Commissioners, and after the Bill of last session, the publication of a return which makes disclosures such as these ought now to be an anachronism, and, notwithstanding the approving statement of the LORD-ADvocATE, we trust that we may accept this paper as a mere relic of the past and as a sure promise of change.

OION1Y-TABRKBTand CITYINRTELLIGEKCE. Frida. Erenlag. The fends opened with great steadines thismorning, and experienced before the close of busimesw a further advance of a quarter per cent. The drat transactions in Consols were at 91i to 92 ex. dividend, and a succession of purchases caused an improvement to 92i to i, at which they were well 'maintained. The Bank return was expected to be -very favourable, and It shows a further increase of 1,381,3661. in the stock of buion. Both the bullion =d the reserve, even supposing the 2,000,0001. o *over-issue to be deducted from the latter, are now ligher than in April last, when the rate of discount -was only 61 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 217 to 218k; Reduced, 92 to i ; New Three per Cent, -92i to I; India Bonds, 35s. to 25s. discount ; and ;1xchequer-bilb, 5s. to i1. discount. In the Stock-Exchange the supply of money is -abundant, and in the dicount-market the best -paper can be readily negotiated at from 8i to 9 per ,cent. At the Bank of England the demand continues limited, and the resources of the establish. anent are augmenting with such rapidity that a -reduction from the minimum rate of 10 per cent. Meems hardly likely to be delayed beyond Thursday next. The forelga stock-market continues to be well aupported, the princlpal demand being for Buenos Ayres, which marked as high as 96. Turkish was -rather actively inquired for, and closed at a slight -advance; Venezuelan alro improved. Brazilian EF1ve per Cents. were negotiated at 97; Buenos Ayres, 94, 96, 934, 92, and 93; Granada Deferred, 5i; Mexican, 19 ; for the account, 19i and ; Portuguese, for the account, 44; Spanish New De-ierred, 25i and i; for the account, 2565; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 94k, i 1, i, J, and I; ditto Four per Cents.

Certificates, 97. ln the foreign exchanges this afternocn there was a demand for bills upon Hamburg, and, from the ,scarcity of the supply, a rate less favourable for this -country was established; the rate upon Paris was also quoted lower than last post. No other alteration of importance occurred. The corn-market this morning was without alteraCon. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows great dulneso, without any change in .prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. !LOo. for money, and 67f. 25c. for the end of the .anonth, showing no alteration. At Hamburg the crisis appears to be rapidly subsiding, the rate of discount for the best paper having fallen to 6 per cent. About 132,0001. of gold of various sorts was taken to the Bank to-day, besides about 40,000 -sovereigns from America and 100,000 from Ireland. A very large amount also is expected to be delivered there to-morrow. The Parana has arrived from the West Indies with i17,2361., of which only 25,2261. i silver, 92,0101. iJeing gold. The Nemesis has brought 11,3391. A week ago an estimate was made in Parliament -that the liabilities of the houses which have failed - during the recent crisis make an aggregate of 45,000,0001. sterling-this being at least double the total reached in 1847. It may be doubted ] if the figures for 1847 would not be found to have amounted to more than 22= millons, but there can be no question that on the present occasion their magnitude Is much beyond anytbing attained at any previous period. Subjoined is a list of the principal Buspenslons announced In London since the beginning of October, when the pressure first decldedly commenced. Only a rough conjecture can be formed as to the total they represent, since iu many instances the 7balance-sheets remain yet to be produced, but 15 or 10 millions may be taken as the lowest sum. The faUures in the provinces, of course, cannot be estimated with an approach to precision, but, as the debts of five banks alone amount to about twenty'three millions (the Western of Scotland 8,911,9321., the Northumberland and Durham about 3,000,0001., the Liverpool Borough about 4,000,0001., the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire, 1,000,0001., and the City of Glasgow, 6,000,0001.), it is evident that thirty-five nilUions would be a very moderate computation for this part of the question. The grand estimate is thus raised to 50,000,0001., and with this before them Parliamnent and the public are bound to use every effort to probe the causes of the evil. Witb the constant' ,extension of activity peculiar to all commercial countries, it is plain that if the same causes ;continue to operate the new revulsion which will be due in 18G7 will as much exceed that of the present year as this exceeds what was witnessed in 1847. At the same time the fact must be recognized that, according to the opinion of Parliament, the elemeents of mischief actually in operation are but faintly represented even in the totals now given. The doctrine is that by the prohibitions and precautions enforced by the Legislature to prevent the mercantile classes from exercising In banlking affairs their own independent judgment an immense amount of disaster is averted. Indeed, upon no other pleacould theFrench systembetoleratedforamoment .iu any branch of business in England. If under this paternal care we have suffered to the extent of 50 millions, what must be the opinion of those who uphold that system as to the total that would have been exhibited if our traders, inseead of being taught to rely upon Government vigilance, had been left to the free exercise of their own ? It must be -such as would far transcend all ordinary conceptions. The discredit to their sagacity, therefore, will be proportionably great if our legislators are unable clearly to trace and expose the baleful influences that have been at work. Out of doors a few persons venture to ask whether the vaunted remedy may Dot, in fact, constitute the root of the diseae, and if it wvould be very rash, after having switnessed throughout the present generation the things that take place under the Parliamentary guidance of banking business, to try the experiment of leaving it to its natural course. In that case hsowever, their functions as regards tbe concerns of trade would be limnited to the simple duty of providing inexpensive means by which, wbile men -were left to make such mutual contracts a3 they -might deem beat, every one attempting to falsify or break such contracts might be dealt with according -to bis deserts. It is much more pleasant to fancy it possible to "control" or " regulate" trade. Any .man who can persuade himself, especially in a coun41y like Great Britain, that he is called to take part in such an operation must be conscious of immente xelE-importance, and, as a general rule, neither Mfinisters, members of Parliament, nor any other of the existing race of human beings, are prone to sur-ender the delusion of imaginary power:- E.

Up to the end of 1855 the profits were 1,0481., and the two partners' drawlngs 1,1391., thus reducing the capital by 891. In 1856 the private expenditure was 1,2451., and the lons on the yeare trading 151., leaving the balance to the credit of the firm on the Slat of December, 1856, 2,9501. The net lose6 for 1857 amount to 30,1811., and include bad debts 10,1031., depreciation of merchandise 13,9671,, &c. The drawings for the same period have been 1,5061. There is no prlvate property, Mr. Barber having settled his furniture and a poLicy of insurance for 2,0001. upon his wife in the early part of 1856. The assets are estimated to produce 2r, in the pound, but it is doubtful if so much will be reaUzed. The firm were stated to have been trading considerably beyond their means, the value of the goods passing through their hands in 1856 being 213,0001., and in 1857 187,0001. They had confined themselves to no particular de. scription of merchandise, but had dealt in every. thing. The failure is attributed to losses during the year. A creditor remarked that they had not succumbed to the preesure of the times; their position would have been the same if the rate of discount had been 2 per cent. instead of 10. The chairman observed that last week Mr. Rosenauer informed him his drawings had been only about 2001. a-year, and that there would be a dividend of 32s. in the pound. Mr. Chatteris said that Mfr. Rosenauer had expressed a wish that the sitaement presented to the meeting ishould show a like dividend; his drawings for the years 1856 and 1857 were, reBpec. tively, 6551. and 7451. The insolvents have had a number of accommodation transactions, or, according to the modern term, had opened blank credits. The statement of affairs seemed to take the meeting by surprise, and gave rise to a lively and indignuant discussion, and it was proposed to throw the concern into bankruptcy. A creditor attempted to oppose this meaaure, on the ground that it would remove all chance of even the smallest dividend, but the meeting insisted it was time such cases should be thoroughly brought before the public, and a resolution was finally adopted to wind up the estate in that court. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Alexander Hlntz and Co., merchants, whose suspension was announced on the 24th ilt., t-ook place this morning, when the following statement was submitted by Mr. Quilter, the accountant:- STATENMENT OF THE AFFAIRS or M1 SSRS.

The cause of the suspension was statel to be the commercial disasters in the North of Europe. The balance at the bankers may be relied on as an available asset unless further failures occur In Hamburg. It was sdated to have been a fortunate circumstance that the firm stopped when they did, as by that means no fresh engagements were entered into, and the assets were preserved to the present creditors. The capital on the 1st of January was estimated at 16,5371., and, notwithstanding the depreciation in merchandise, they would still have produced sufficient to pay off the ordinary debts nearly in full. Heavy liabilities, however, had been incurred on account of other parties. Great sympathy for the firm was expressed by the meeting. It was resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, and a committee was appointed accordingly. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Allen, Smith, and Co., merchants, whose Buspension was announced on the 18th ult., was held this morning, when, from a statement prepared by Messrs. Quilter and Ball, the accountants, the liabilities were stated to be 20,3061., while the assets were eetimated at 4,5441. The private property of Mr. Allen is, however, sufficient to cover the deficiency, with, It is hoped, a surplus of 10,0001.; Mr. Smith has also furniture worth about 5001. The stoppage was stated to have been caused by the numerous failure3 in Sweden. It was resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, some legal measares being neceseary to complete the realization of Mr. Allen's estate. The suspension has been announced to-day of Messrs. Powell and Son, Manchester warehousemen. They were a respectable firm, and it is hoped the liquidation will not show any serisus deficiency. Their liabilities are estimated at about 60,0001. Annexed is the circular issued .- "No. 11, Fiday-street, London, Dec. 18. "We regret to state that we are under the necessity of stopping payment. We harve continued our business as long as there appeared a probability of doing so with justice to our creditors and ourselveg. We trust that the loss (if any) which our creditors may sustain wil be of smaUl amount. " Our principal creditors have instructed Messrs. Parrin. ton, Ladbury, and Co., of King-street, acconntants, to In. vestigate the state of our affairs, and the result will be sub. mitted to you as early as possible. "We are, &o., "W. J. POWELL A-I SON." The bills were returned to-day of Messrs. William Dray and Co., engineers and agricultural implement makers. A meeting of the South Australian Company wa held this afternoon, Mr. Divett, M.P., in the chair, when the report was adopted unanimously. The dividend payable for the half-year ending the 31st inst. Is at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " Affairs continue to progress satisfactorily, and the rentroUs made up to the 25th of March last exbibit a steady Improvement. The particulars are as follows :-Riental of country lands, 15,9711.; rental of town lands and buildings, 4,240!. ; rental of port lands and buildings, 3,2141.; rental of mineral lands, 983!.; together, 24,4081.; showing an advance of 1,2461. on the amount of the prevlous half-years and 1,866!. on that of the corresponding period In 1856. Since they were made up additional leases have been advised of 5,731 acres of the country, 1,691 acres of themineral lands, and a quarter of an acre In the town. These addi. tional leases include 3,485 acres of land recently purchased, The total number of acres actalUy leased up to the date of the last advices (8th October), amounted to 66,747,exclusive of 35 town acres let to yearly tenants. The sales during the half-year consist of 304 acres of the country land, about 22 acres of the port land, and three acres of the mineral land in the township of Kanmantoo. The whole hba realized the sum of 3,1371. Further sales have been advised since the 30th of April, realizing 1,6851. The rental will be redauced by these sales to the extent of 241!. A considerable addition has been made to the property during the half-year; 4,521 acres of lan d have been purchased In various districts for the Ham of 4,8241., being at the average price of 21. 4d. per acre; 3,485 aores, already alluded to, have been secured for 20s. per acre, situate on the shores of LAke Albert, a lease of which has been grauted at a rent of 10 per cent. on the purchase money. The remaining 1,034 acres purchased are of good agricultural quality, and situate in the distriots of Light and Gilbert, about 30 to 40 miles north of Adelaide. It thus appears that while the sum of 4,8221. has been realized by the sale of only 393 acres, the property of the company has been increased by the purchasg of 4,521 acres for a similar amount. The total land possessed at the date of the last advices (October 8) was 78,000 acres. The gross receipts for wharfs and warehouses for the six months ending 30th of AprU amount to 4,3791., being only 243!. less than the previous half-year. This decrease is, however, made up by the rents received for those portions of the warehouses leased, which are ncluaded under the head of Port rents. It is gratifying to add that during the six months the wharfage receipts have largely Increased, being 9784. over the amount of the previous half-year, and 1,1454 over that of thec eorresponding period in 1856. The neow wharf in the interior of the creek is now nearly completed, and will be brought into operation as soon as the swing-bridge across the entrance is erected. As shown br the wharfage received, there has been an increase in the number of veesels loaded and discharged at the company's wharf during the half-year of 25vesselsand 8,209 tons over the corresponding period of the previous year. The amount derived from the ordinary sources of revenue, which has been carried to credit for the half. year ending in the colony 30th April, and in London 31st October, is 15,2261., besides a small sum to be received for about 10 tons of copper ore, now at Swansea, but not yet sold. The lessees of a part of the Kanmantoo mine contlnue working the mine, having 32 men and boys em. ployed. Their smelting works have been completed, and smelting commenced. An application for a lease of a further portion of this property had been received from another party; but the terms had not been arranged at the date of the last advices. The directors are able to state that the colony generally is prospering. Its population was estimated at 109,000 on the 1st of April last. The imports during the first six months of the present year were estinated at 801,070!, vhile the exports for the same perlod were 851,660!. The railway to G awler Town had been completed, and was opened for traffio on the 5th of October last. The prospects of the coming harvest were favourable, and the farmers were obtaining 93. to 9s. 6d . per bushel for wheat." Iathe produce markets during the week extreme dullness has continued to prevail, and prices generally have been more favourable to the buyers; many of the leading staples, however, attracting the attention of speculators, a more animated demand will probably arise after the close of the year. Sugar must be quoted Is. to Is. 6d. lower, and some soft Muscovado dinds were disposed of In many instances at 2s. below the valuation. Floating cargoes have sold more freely, chiefly for this kingdom, at a proportionate reduction. No material change ha3 occurred in the coffee-market, buyers awaiting the arrivals of the new crop. Cocoa, from the same cause, ha3 been inactive. The unprecedentedly heavy stock of rice prevents any advance, and Ballam has sold for cash as low as 7s. per cwt. The excessive supplies of spice keep the value depressed, but there Is now a better inquiry. An unusually large quantity of pimento submitted by auction to-day went off better than anticipated, although numerous parcels of the new crop are arriving. Saltpetre has again given way Is. to Is. 6d., most descriptions selling at lower rates than last month. Accounts from Calcutta are I looked upon as favourable to holders in this market. Business in tea has been confined to small purchases by the trade for immediate requirements and to a few operations on the part of speculators. Common congou closes at 1lid. to Ilid. cash, or Is. per lb. full terms. The half-yearly dividend of the National Bank of Ireland is at {he rate of 6 per cent., with a bonus of lOs. per share, making in all a distribution equal to 8 per cent. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day it was intimated that an arrangement had been made between the assignees of MIr. W. Smith, of the Hemel Hempiptead Bank, ia the executors of his late partner, Mr. IVtiittingatall, under which it was anticipated thsl.the =rditors of the bank will receive a dividied-litt2e. zhort of 20a, in the poucuO. This iatir i4iM koe ree,1g4,, hp.W r, Buk ect * Meat of the oreditorm on this estate held secu.ritv in the shape of bills of exchange, which are rapidly rcnning off. Hence the extent of the faUure is more appaxent than real to the fact that the arrangement agreed upon is not yet out of the Court of Chancery. By a deciion of the committee of the Stock-Exchange to-day the name of Mr. 0. H. Taylor was removed from the list of members. It appears that the Submarine Telegraph Company have lately discharged one of the persons in their employ in consequence of a discovery that messages received from the continent--especially, it Is believed, those addressed to the Government-had been adroitly conveyed at the xame time to other parties. The practice had been going on for a long period, and the facts now brought to light have removed many supicions that had previously rested upon other individuals Mr. Taylor having been alleged to hare been the receiver of these messages, the whole matter was submitted to the Stock Exchange Comn mittee, and the denial made not being deemed satisfactory, the resolution that he should ceae to be a member was adopted.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, DEC. 18. Good useful quaitles of American cotton have given way in price this week gd. to 3d. per lb., with a new crop promislng wln in quality and quantity, and a fair extent of imports. Ths has added to the depreesion of prices here, An to the gioom whioh has sottled over the goods market. Thereois a gleam of hope in this rapid decline of the raw material, bowever, that prioes baving nearly reached the lowest probable point of depreciation, there will be more steadiness and confidence in the cloth-mtaket that wiU encourage busineess so soon ae the money-market is sufficientlyeasy For the present there is no symptom of such a desirable change. Heavy domestles, longeloths, and T-cloths have been in some little demand this week, but the prices offered havo been lower, and the sales effected are reported at ra'es nearly as low as we have had for some yea past. Printing cloths and 36 and 40 inch shirtings are very difficult of sale, even at a decline of prices. For yarus the demand still fals much short of the very limited production, and spinners have to submit to considerable reductions, especially in the kinds and qua7itles usually taken for Germany, with so much irregularity in prices as to render quotations almost impracticable. Spinners and manufacturers appear very much disheartened, and the losses of the large and wealthier milowners, who, folowing a rule adopted partly from pride and in some instances out of consideratfon for their workpeopJe, in times of depression like the present, of never closing their milbs have been exceedingly severe. Instances are mentioned of accutmulation of stoks, and consequent losses by depreciation, which seem to be almost fabulous. The failures In this district have been few and of small amount when oor-a pared with those elsewhere, though losses have been heavy and very general, but a confident feeling begins to be entertained that the shock having been sustained so wel we shall come out of the crisis better than was expected.
CANCRLLBD CHEBCS. TO T'PE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-If the drawer, or any one of the negotiators, tear off the left-hand upper corner of the check, it wMill be a mutilation sufficient to justify a banker's refasal to pay except through a banker, and it may beeome easy in practice, so that a banker would be compelled to admit It as an instruc. tion as well as justifed in acting upon it, and the check could not be made square again at the corners without damaging the date or the money part. Yours obedientl. T. H. RUMBALL. St. Alban's, Dee. 17.
TO THB EDITOBR OF THe TIMES. Sir,-There is such a thing as driving tbings too far, and if the Great Eastern Is to be of any use afloat it is time the E oientific system were abandoned aud the ordinary way of lanzohing resorted to before it Is too late. The vessel may yet be removed from her present " ways" and latd upon new slidesof wood, andsent "cheerly" Intothe water; from the slight declivity of 1 in 12, and launching broadside she will not taeie the water with such a speed as if sent end on, and much danger avoided. When clearing the slides there must be a splash l the one case-no more would bh In the other, besides much less expense. Had we the job on the Clyde the ship would have been afloat long ago, but I suppose it would not have answered so well, because it could have been done cheaper. Let the company offer a price for her launching, and tbey wiiU have plenty able and wiUing not only to take her to the water, but mako her swim. I am even presmptuous enough to tbnlk, -with a snfflicient staff of men without any machinery more than carpenters generally use, I would reblock her, place her on new ways, and have her safely afloat in a fortnight. I am. Sir. &c.. A CLYDE CHIP. Gl]agow, Dec. 17.
WnrnEnv&M ELBUMceo.-On Thursday NIr. George Lyall was elected without oppositton for Whitehaven, in the room of Mr. Ii. C. Hiloyard, deceased. Mr. Lyall was proposcd by Mr. Clarke, and Mr. J. Moore seconded the nomination. Mr. Lyr ll, in returning thanks. alluded to political and general topics. He sad ldhi opinions were those of hisfather. He wasa Conservative. le was not, however, opposed to progress and reform. Tbe Con.. servative party wished to preserve the anoient institutions of the country upon the old foundation, and to maintain those characteristics which had plaoed -England In the ascendant, and made her the glory and envy of the world. They knew nothing of the me6sure of reform vwhtch the .cvernment intended to propose, but if it should be a moderate measure, and simply an improvement upon the present Reform Bill, he did not believe that the Conservative party Wrould oppose it. In reference to the currency question Mr. Lyall exprcssed a hope that nothing would be aone to endanger the convertibility of the bank-note or bring upon us the depression which A merica experienced by her conversion of speete payment, which no doubt had beemi the ruin of that coiuntry. Mr. la3ll said he should not reaark upon the natives i2 lni.a, but bhould only express adnirration at the indomia,e ova2or of our countrymen and countrywomems when they wore surrounded by the heathens there. Hle im.siea that whatever might be done in regard to Indi% Ia care would be taken to have a large _Dglish armi tny se, so as not to require native assistance, except a smral cn .ingent force.

In the address they expressed their regret at hbis retirement, their admiration of the manner in which hc had dis. obarged the duties of the offices- first of Advocate-General ard afterwards of Judge, and their gratithde for the unvarying courtesy which he had shown to every member of the professlon since his elevation to the bench, and in concluAfon wished him long life and happiness. Sir John Dodson in his reply tbanked them warmly for the addreis, and said that on entering at Doctors' Commons in 180S a pfsfeot stranger he was received with grest kindness by the lrofessinn, and he had endeavoured to reciprocate the courtesy which had been shown to hin from that time to the present. Although, he added, he could not flatber himsvlf That his services as Advocate-Geueral. would bear a .comparison with those of Lord Stowell %nd other eminent men who had filled that office, yet it was gratifying to him after holding it for 1S years to receive through the medium ,.f the Foreign Office the approbation of the Government.

At Alexandria on the 5th the usual Egyptian fleet were lying at anchor. Her Majesty's ships Royal Albert, Hibernia, Conqueror, Princess Royal, Centurion, Vulture, Desperate, Vigiluante, Coquette, Harpy, and Caradoc, and a Turkish steauu (frigate were at Ilta. On the 13th Her Majesty's ship Curlew and the Prussian frigate Thetis were at GibrAltar. - The hired ship Lady MI'Naughten, with 200 eonvicts from Portsmouth for the dockyard establishraent at Gibraltar, anchored off the Ragged Staff during the night of the 5th inst.; and they were landed on the 7th. The steam transport Euxine (Peninsular and Oriental Company), with the 3d diviion of the 69th Regiment on board, arrived at Gibraltar on the 8th' at 7am., and having taken in 290 tons of coal at the New Mole left at the -ame hour on the 9th for Malta and Alexandria.

The Orient took her in tow, and having been supplied with chain and anchors from the shore, she wes, in the afternoon, safely moored in the bay. The following is the report of the disaster suffered by the James Booth wbile prosecuting her voyage from Liverpocl to Australia, which, as reported by the Tagus steamer, was towed into Gibraltar Bay, from off Cabrita Point, on Saturday, by the steam-tug Orient:- "The James Booth, from Liverpool for Melbourne with a general cargo, in lat. 31 N., long. 19 W., experienced severe weather. On the 27th the foremast gave way by the rlgging, every exertion was made to save the mainmast, but, at 3 p.m. on the following day, it broke by the board, bringing down the mizen-topmast and All above it; part of it fell on board and the remainder over starboard, smashing pumps and pump-gear, two boats, deck-house, after-batch, rails and stanchions and everything within its reach, the sea at the time makdng a complete breach over the ship. The master then gave orders to cut and clear away, in order to get at the pumps, to ease the ship for fear of more damage. The next day rigged jury masts and bore for Gibraltar, being the best port at hand for making good the damage sustained. Tbe ship is leaky and will have to dis. charge to effect repairs." The French vessels Henri and Lucie, Captains Qairval and Fabre, and theSpanish ones Carmelita and DosAmigoe, Captains oonan and Joy, were wrecked on the 30th uilt. between Palamos and Guixols.

TuE1 MxurFACRT[G Dismicrs.-The accounts from the manufacturing districts this week show but little improvement on the whole, and there is still a good deal of inactivity in vanous branches of trade. ln the Birming. sam distct a general reduction of operations continues, and the number of miils and forges working short time is on the increase. At Bradford the number of applicants for Poor Law relief is increasing, the number of paupers at the present time being about 300 in excess of that of the corresponding perod of la5t year. A public subscription hs been entered into for the rellef of the distressed. At Blackburn some improvement has taken place by * number of mills running full time, but this is only for the fulfilment of Immediate and limited orders, and it is feared short time will have to be resorted to generally before many weeks are past. Some of the iron moulders hxve struck work in con. sequence of a reduction of their wages to the extent of 2s. per 'week. The inorease of applicants for relief is 979 compared with the number of the corresponding period of last year. At BishopAuokland several of the blast furnaces have been blown out, and agood many hands havebeen deprived of work. AtBallymacsrettthere are264 idlelooms, uponwhich 1,244 persons are dependent for the means of support. many of the weavers have entered the army and the Milltia. At Chadderton Fold there is much distress, and measures of relief have been organized by a committee of gentlemen, of whom the Rev. J. R. Dunne is the head. At Haslingden all the mills are working short time but two, and one his stopped entirely. At Hartlepool and West Hartlepool large numbers of workmen are out of employment. The ship carpenters of the two ports have received notice of a reduction of their wages from 5s. to 4s. per day, and appear unwilling to accede to the abatement. At Hallfax the mills are mostly running four days a-week, and trade mattera generaUy are dull the recent stoppage of the firm of S. C. Lister and Co. casting an additional gloom over the town. At Kidderminster the miUs and weaving sheds are running short time. Handloom weaving is nearly at a standstill, and severe distress is felt among the operatives. At Manchester there is an increase of unemployed operatives and those on short time. There are 109 mills on short time, 23 stopped altogether, and 50 with less than the full complement. Of the workpeople 15,498 ar working full time, against 17,587 the previous weleks 21,766 on short time against 19,33-; and 9,185 persons wholly unemployed, against 8,900 in the previous week. The number of applicants for out-door yelief showed an excess of 974 persons over the corresponding week of last year. The silk trade at Middleton, Tonge, . Fsilsworth, and the vicinity is in a very depressed state, anz( distress is on the increase. The trade at the cotton mills is also dull, and the hAnds have not more than four days' work siweek on the average. At Nottingham the lace trade continues extiemely depressed, althonjg, upto the present time, this town has not suffered so much as might have beens expected. There have, however, been many suspesions, and there is much suffering among the operatives. The prostration of commerce has extended its influence to the iron trade of the north of England, which has been for several years past highly prosperous, and it has been resolved to extnguish one-feurth of the furnaces of the nelghbourfiood, wvhich will diminish the wforkmens earnings by about 5,0C00, per wreek. At Newchurch 2,146 out of 3,124 operatives are on abort time. At Kewrton.heath the woeking population are undergoing much prlvation, but the rector of the parish, in coonexon with others, is assiduously em ployed in administering relief. At Oldbau thereia an increas. lUg numberof a~pilo Utk for relief, and thegu rdiansare dehatingwrhethert ey shoulduotdispense with the labonr test on their own responsibility, having had a very unsatisfactory interview wit the local inspector, Mr. Menwaring, on the subject. At Ossett there is a great paucity of employment, after along season of brisk trade, but the change is borne patiently by the operatives, many of 'whom, it is seid, have money in hand. At Preston nearly all the mills are on short time, but there is no marked increase In, the amount. cf distress among the working classes. At Rilkingkon ther are 1,400 operatives on short time, and 60 in full work. In the Pottery districts trade is no worse tban it was a fortnight ago, but, if anything, a shade better. At-the manufactories engaged in the home and continental trade there iv even some deg reeof briskness. At Rocbdale there Is not mnuch change in the state of trade gnerally.; the average time of running the mills continues to be. four days per week, and thern is an increae of abont- 60 applicanX forr relief compared with the corresponding week of. last year. The Spitalfields weavers ars, for the most part, in great destitution, In Nor4h Stafordshire there. bave been sonme extensiveo -strikes" of colliers, Ithrowers," and forgemen, in c.nsequance of a reduction of wages having been &uposed upon themD, and tn one instanoe the turnouts have tome into coWsion with the police, severl of whom wer'i Wounied &)n Sovth StafJ lordshire some fresh failu are an`oujsoad, and tra4e is vesy depressed.

The Parana hasihad fine weather throughout the voyage. Our dates from Jamaica extend to the 27th ult. The Legislature had met on the 10th, and Governor Darling delivered his speech to both branches. The two Chambers appeared to have entered cheerfuUy upon their work, and the utmost harmony prevailed in the island. Two or three Bills, not of much importance, had passed the Lower Hoouse,and were sent to the Legislative Council for its concurrence. Much sickness prevailed in Kingston, and there had been several fatal cases of fever. Mining operations continued to look favourable, and promised good returns to parties interested. The weather was extremely sultry, and there had been some heavy showers of rain at intervals. The sugar crops were encouraging, and looked healthy, but want of capital was much felt in the island. There were numerous conjectures in reference to the removal of the Post-office from under the Imperial Government and placing it entirely under local management. This step appeared to be unpopular in some quarters, as complaints were rife respecting the loose management of the Customs under the Island compared with its eiliciency under Imperial control. The Hon. Alexander G. Fyfe had been called to the Legislative Council. De Cordova's Mercantile InUteligeocer of the 26th says:- " There Is little calling for speclal remark on the state of our market during the last fortnight. Things remain about the same as last stated. The paucity of arrivals has caused uas to remain as badly supplied with all American stuffs as we were at last isse, and prices therefore have been generally maintained at the high rates last quoted. Money has been somewhat scarce, the banks being disinclined to accommodste. The 5, 000b. in specle received by one bank per last steamer from Europe is too small an amLount to oause any great improvement. Of island produce, pimento reLains inactive, so much so that it is ilmpossAble to give any coTrect quotation. Coffee has been kept from market by continued heavy rains in the country, and transactions in the article have been therefore very liited." Exchanges on London were quoted as under Jamaica Bank-90 days, par; 60 days, i per cent. pm.; 30 days, 1 per cent. pm. Colonial Bank-90 days, par; 60 days, i per cent. pm.; 80 days, 1 per cent. pm. Commissarlat bills, ; per cent. pm. Merchants' Bills-90 days, i to 1 per cent. diecount. The Court of Policy at Demerara had met twice since the last packet left, the business of the first meeting, on the 13th ult., being opened by a brief, but eloquent eulogy on the lamented Dr. Blair by the Lieutenant-Governor. Dr. Blair dled on the9th of November, and his funeral was a public one, the deceased gentleman, who held the situation of Surgeon-General of British Guiana, being greatly respected. Mr. C. Conyers had been elected a member of the Court of Policy, in the room of Mr. Macdonald; and Mr. J. W. Thompson, In the room of Dr. Blair. The weather at Demerara had been fine for the fortnight, and the in-gathering of the crop was proceeding rapidly. The present wvould, it was said, be the largest crop yet made at Demerara since the abolition. Produce was also arriving plentifully for shipment; since the last packet the following exports had taken place:Sugar, 2,839 hhds., 274 tierces, 47 half-tierces, 769 barrels, and 32 tierces foreign; rum, 1,119 puneheons, 183 hhds., and 48 barrels; molasses, 90 puncheons, 4 hhds., and 29 casks. Tonnage was abundant, anld freights going down. The files of Barbadoes papers contain nothing of interest, The weather was favourable, and the canes gave promise of an early crop, and one of the largest ever reaped. American breadstuffs were in good supply, and with further arrivals the article must decline in price. Irish and American butter was in demand. Cod fish dull. Nothing done in produce since last report. From Trinidad 275 bags of cocoa have been sent home by this steamer. The St. Lucia Legislature was in session, but nothing was doing worth notice. From Greytown and Grenada the news contains little of interest. Much talk was taking place on the supposed reappearance of General Walker, who was stated to be on his way with 2,000 men well armed and victualled for a campaign. The officlal paper of Grenada publishes a declaration of war against Costa Rica, for the purpose of preserving its rights to the whole line of transit from San Juan del Norte to San Juan del Sur, as well as the district of Guanacasta. The same paper names the Provisional Government during the time that Generals Martinez and Xeres take charge of the army, General Tomas Miartinez acting as Commander-in-Chief. On the other hand, Costa Rica seems determined to maintain her right to the disputed territory, and, through General Oauty (an ll:nglishman in the command of the Costa RMCa army), calls on the Governor of the San Carios Fort to deliver it up to him, and, in case of refusal, intimates his intention of blockading the fort, and starving him into compliance. Reports had reached Greytown that an attempt had alkeady been made to seize the fort, but whether successful or not seemed to be uncertain. The post Itself is an important one, commanding the transit at that point. At Colon and Panama the commercial distress In New York was being felt, and a rather absolute notice that had been issued by the railroad company, to the effect that all payments connected with the line were henceforth to be made in American currency, had produced qui a sensaMton. Therewere rumours afloat questioning the solveny of one of the largest forwarding houses on the isthmus. Adnvces from ManzanliUo are up to the 11th of November. A remittance from the city of Mexico, to the amount of 19,850 dollars, was shipped per Golden Gate for England. A conducta, with Nabout 1,000,000 dollars, was daily expected, and a steamaer had left Panama to bring it down; but, owing to hier getting on shore, the treasure had not arrived at 3?anama when the miails left. The country round the city of Mexico, particularly towards Vera Cruz, was in a very unsettled state. Various rumours of risings against the romonfort Government were current, and the assiduity with which these reports were spread by the priests proved how acceptable any chainge from the present would be to them. The unsettled state of affairs at Vera Cruz and Tampica wil, doubtless, prevent any remittance cominin this way by the next mail. SHIPPING INTE:IJGENCE.

Tho American schooner Reindeer, Captain Stevenson, arrived at St. Thomas, from Baltimore, fell in on the 22d of November with the British brigantine Golden Age, waterlogged; took off the second mate, named Jonathan Nickerson, a native of Barrington, Cape Island, Nova Scotia. He reported that on the 2d of November the Golden Age, of Halifax, Captain William Attwood, left that port, bound for Ponce, Porto Rico, laden with a careo of fish; that on the 9th, a little before daybreak, a heavy squal1, attended with a heavy sea, rain, thunder, and lightning, struck the brig and threw her on her beam-ends; that in the first instance an effort had been made to cut away, in hope of righting her, which, however soon proved ineffectual; that a Uttle while after the squal passed he discovered that he was the only survivor lett, all the others having been washed clean away - that he succeeded ia reacbing the foremast t3gging by tho top, where he continued for a period of 13 days. During that time the only support he eceived was by the occasional showers that would fall, and, placing his lips against the mast opposite a split therein, which formed a spout for the water, he obtained at each time a few mouthEulls; added to tlis circumstancoe, that of the number of casks of fish that had forced their way from the hold after the hatches were gone one lodged at the coamings, and tha', he slid himself down, broke in the lid, and filled his shirt bosom with so much of the fish as it could conveniently hold, and returned to his original ref uge; in order to deprive the fish of its salt, which helnew would create greater thirst, he manipulated it for some time till it resembled aball, when he ate it. In this remarkable and distressing condition he continued for 13 days, when he was descried biy the Reindeer. He remained at St. Thomas in charge of the British Consul, who intended to send him to Halifax by first steamer. The English schooner San Jose, Wilson, from Baltlmore for Bermuda, with a cargo of corn and flour, put; into St. Thomas on the 26th ult., leakmng badly from stress of weather, and would have to undergo repairs; *the principal portion of her cargo was damazed.

THE PACIFIC. The arrival at Southampton of the mail steamer Parana from the West Indies puts us In possession of files of Panama papers to the 23d nit The steamship Bolivia, Captain Johnson, from CalSlo Nov. 11, had arrived in Panama Bay on the morning of the 21st with the mails from the South Pacific coast of the folovWing dates:-Valparaiso, Oct. 31; Lima, Xov. 11; Paita, Nov. 16. From Chill we learn that during the last fortnight no favourable alteration had taken place in the money-market, wbich still continued distressed. Credit sustained Itself, which proved much as to the confidence reposed In the solvability of the merchants. Bilso:linglandwereat therate of 46 and 47, aud the interest on money remained firm at 1, per cent. on good securities. A very small remittance goes forward by this snal for England. Provisions were very dear and scarce, and a great deal of distress was felt among the labouring population. This mostly applied to the southern provinces, and a subscription had been raised In Valparaiso to alleviate as much as possible these sufferings. Congress wass tiU sitting, and the railway loan of $7,000,000 had been passed and approved by the Senate. A dezcee permitting the importation of sheet iron free of duty had been passed. The affair of the Sportsman, captured in the port of Santa Maria, where she was loading copper ore without a Chillan permission, still remained in abeyance, but it was well known that the American Minister and the French Consul had demanded satisfaction for the act. The Sportsman was stiU in the port of Caldera, abandoned by her master, who, it is said, claimed $100 per day as damages and losses. The steamer Maria Isabel, bought from the English Government, had arrived; she made the voyage in 102 days; she experienced bad weather and was oat of fuel. The news of a most horrlble occurrence, which was before dreaded, had just been confirmed. The bark Sarah Ann, bound from Chili to the Island of Oceania with passengers and merehandise, was wrecked on one inhabited by savage cannibals, and every peson on board was devoured by the monsters. The details of this frightful calamity had not been received. At Callao the National Convention had just been dissolved by actual force; in fact, the Disputados were driven from their seats at the point of the bayonet. CastiUa had publio opinion with him, and, although there had been an attempt to shift the responsibility on the shoulders of Colonel Argueda, yet, now that the public had declded in its favour it was expected that the act would be acknowledged by the authoritMes.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. I~~~ Sir,-The ptblication of the accompanying letter may assist the praiseworthy and benevolent movement now taking place to alleviate the distress and privations of the wives and children of soldiers who are separated from their natural proteebors by the calls of their country; and it Is not creditable to that country that any such eleemosynary effort should be necessary. Your obedient servant. W. HI. SYKES. I Lonfon, .uec. 1w. " 46, Sohool-hill, Aberdeen, Dec. 14. "In the Aberdeon Herald of Saturday lat it is stated:'We understand that during the last few days no fewer than 46 applications for parochial relief were made at the office of tho St. Nicholas Parochial Board, that in these applications are embraced 101 children, and that the appl1cants are almost exclusively the wives of the Militiamen who left Aberdeen for Dublin on the morning of Thursday last. * * * I " Now, Is not this statement humiliating, so far at least as regards the wives of Militiamen? It is painful to think that the man who engages in the defence of his country is necessarily so circumstanced that he can make no provision for his wife and fam31y out of his pay when called from them to another part of the kingdom. Is it right that his wife and children should bo at once brought to the level of pauperismn? It is impossible that out of his inadequate pay he can provide in his absence on duty for them, And if the country must step in to assist them it would surely he infinitely better that it were done otherwise than in the shape of parochial relief. " I trust you will excuse me in bringing this matter under your notice. My only motive in doing so is to try to enlist your sympathy and influence for the benefit of a class of individuals who suffer mnost unjustly and most shabbily at the hands of the Government. The families of those who in the great exigencies of the country devote themselves to the service of the community surely have a claim to be preserved from the hardship and degradation Inseparable from the present position of our Militia. "On partial drill, and ilvingin the place'of their common avocations, a Militiaman may bore through his difficulties but when on full drill, or removed to another part of the kingdom, his family has nothlng for it but beggary or the refined process of starvation, which many of those undergo who cannot bring themselves to pnt forw ard the claims of a pauper.

AWW RBPOrT. COURT OF CHANCERY. LTConTR.Tmw ,n- 1 PERRB-CRRKVAVV; V. ; (Before the LotRn VJTA? -.T % This was an appWel ftomn a decree of the Master of the olios. The suit was instituated to settle prioriteies among the mortgagees of an estatebelonging to Mr. John Attwood, situate in the county of ussex, and commonly known as the Hylands estate, and which ws purchased by the saia John Attwood fTom the Right Hon. Henry Lahonchere, it 1839, for 50,C000. This estate John Attwood demised to- two of his sisters, Maria Attwood and Francea Attwood, for 200 years, to secure 10,OO0Z. to each of them, wad 10,060W. to hLis sisterCatharineTroward, beingthoamountofcertin bequeits to them by their fathers wIl1 and of which the said 5or1: Attwood was sole execator. The mortgage deed was prepared on behalf of all parties by oger Wili.s , of Brrnigbam, then the solicitor of the. Attwood family, and bore date the 30th of January, 1848. Messrs. Pooley and Co. were then the London agents of B. W. Gem, bab in the subsequent mortgage transactions Messrs. Pooley and Co. acted directly as John Attwood's solicitors. The mortgage deeds were allowed to remain in the power of John Atiwood, the mortgagor, front some canse upon which there was a conflict of evidence. No notlce of the mortgage was endorsed on the deeds, and they were afterw%rds deopositedby John Attwoodwith htessr. Pooley and Co. n the year 1.850 Messrs. Pooley and Co. applied to Mr.Whitaker, a solicitor, for a. loan to John Attwood upon the security of the Hylands estate, representlng It to be unencambered, and producing the title-deeds for Whitaker's inspetion. A loan of 15,0001. was accordingly o,btained from Messrs. Edl. ward Caxdwell and Charles Cardwsll, clients of Whitaker, and an indenture was executed, dated the 7th of September, 1850, whereby John Attwood. conveyed the wholeof the Hylands estate to Edward CardwelU and Charles Cardwell, by way of mortgage, for ecuring 15,0001. and interest. On tbis occasion the title was submitted to counsel and approved, and regular search was made for judgments and crown debts, and tho whole of the tItl6-dee6is were deposited with Whitaker; hut, as the bll alleged, there was nothing to lead to any notice or suspiclon of the mortgage of January, 1848. Three other sums were afterwards advanced to John Attwood, through Whitaker, upon the security of the same estate-namely, a further sum of 5,0001., by Messrs. Cardwell, secured by au Indenture of further charge, dated January, 1851; 3,000. advanced by Whitaker and Atchison, and secured by an indenture of mortgage, dated the 17th of May, 1851; and 2,0001. advanced by H. H. Rice, and secured by a mortgagae, dated the 27th of August,185L Subsequent mortgages of the same estatewere executed by JohnAttwoodlnfavour of other parties, and the incumbrances amountedin the whole to up. wards oE140,000l. On the 22dof September,1853, themortgage and further charge of September, 1850, and January, 1851, and the mortgages of May, 1851, and August, 851, were respectively transferred to the plaintiffs, without their receiving any notice of the mortgage of 1848. The question was whether the claim of the Misses Attwood was to bs postponed to that of the plaintiffs, and the Master of the BRols decided in the affirmative, on the ground that their misfortune had arisen from allowming the deeds to remain with their brother, and trusting to his honour not to prejudice their charge. From this decision the Misses Attwood appealed. Mr. Fooxs Wad not concluded opening the appellant's case when the Court rose.
VIMCHACANTELTTORR' nnR.rrR V- n-n io 'ROWn 'V Rn.Y T. (Before Vile CVhanaMor Sir R . KTrNDmstv This case was argued on the 7th and 9thof November last, when his Honour reserved bis jud;ment. The biU was filed by Joseph Bond, a judgment creditor of Adam Glen, baker, late of 100, Regent-street, and keeper of the White Bear, Iiccadilly, to establish a lien upon certain property of his debtor. The facts were these :-In October, 1853, Adam Glen applied to the plaintiff to lend him 6001. by way of discount upon a bill of exchange for that amount, renewable at six months, the payment, when renewed, to be secured by a judgment, with a stay of execution for six months. To this the plaintiff agreed, aud an order was made to sign judgment by Mr. Baron Martin in chambers. Accordingly Glen accepted the bill of exchange drawn upon bir, by the plaintiff, and the bill was paid, minus 1001. for discoant for 12 months, by a banker's check, which was cashed. On the 6th of October, 1853, judgment was signed pursuant to the judge's order in the Exchequer, and the memorial registered in the Common Pleas. The bill of exchange became due and was renewed, and a new bill given, which, however, when it in turn fell due on the 8th of October. 1854, was dishonoured. Glen then requested the plaintiff to allow the 6001. to remain due and the judgment to be a security, which the plaintiff agreed to; and on the 7th of October, 1854. another bil of exchange for 6001. was drawn, accepted, and the discount deducted as before. Thls bill was also dishonoured and another given with the same result, the last biUl being dated the 14th of Jnly, 1855, and falling due the 17th of Jsnuary, 1856. On the renewal of theso bills Glen paid 371. 10s. and 561. 5s. On the 25th of September, 1855, the memorial of the judgment was registered in Middlesex. On the 12th of November, 1855, Glen was made banraupt, and the defendants Rose and Fountain ohosen trade assignees. Contemporaneously with those transactions the following took place:-ln June, 1855, Glen obtained a lease for 21 years of the shop 106, Regent-street, at a rent of 3001. a-year, sad his interest was therefore of great value, and on the 18th of August, 1855, the chief defendant, John Bonthron, purchased Glen's Interest by indenture, dated the 22d of September, for 3,8001., with the baking business and trade fixtures, and by the direction of Glen that mum was paid to certain millers to whom Glen was indebted, in the following manner:3,4001. by three promissory notes of 1,1301. 6s. 8d. each, which were handed over to Edward Fountain, Henry Mercer, and John Mercer, and 4001., the residue paid, by Bonthron's relinquishing the goodwill of a business carried on by him at Clayland-place, Clapham-road. Glen was also posseEsed of freehold property at Eaverhill, in Suffolk, and leaseholds in Middlesex, subject to a mortga.ge for 5001. to the defendant, J.-A. Wilson, at 5 per cent.; and also to a freehold called Eagle-lodge, Old Brompton, which was also mortgaged to the defendant Maugham for 2001. by a deposit of the titledeeds in May, 1855, and a bill of exchange, accepted by Glen, for that amount, R. Maugham had never registered his mortgage, but Bonthron had registered his assignment on the 20th of November, 1855. Upon this state of circumstances the plaintiff filed his bill, charging that at or since the time of the registry of the judgment Glen was selsed of property In Suffo and Middlesex mortgaged as above, and thatbewarsentitled to redeem both, and that Maugham had notice of the judgment; that Bonthron purchased the premIses 106, Regent-street, subject to the judgment, which remained as a charge thereon; that the promissory notes were not paid, or, if paid, not until after Bonthron knew or h?ad notice of the judgment; and that on the 18th of September, 1855, L. . Mead, clerk to the plaintiff's solicitor, called on and saw Bonthron at 106, Regent-street, and told him of the judgment, when he replied that the milers had arranged it all and would save him harmless. The plaintiff also charged that the asgnment of the 22d of September, 1855, was not executed at that date, and the bill prayed a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to a lien, by way of equitable mortgage, upon the freeholds and leaseholds which Glen was seised of or entitled to at or subsequent to the entering up of the judgment, subjeot to the mortgage of Wilson, but In priority to that of Maugham, and notwith. standing the assignment to Bonthron; and in the alternative, suectto t h tue mortgages for an account and sale, to settle priorities, and for a receiver. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Cracknall appeared for the plaintiff Mr. Baily and Mr. Caldecott for Maugham and Bonthron Mr. Bagallay for Wilson; Mr. Bury for the assignees of Glen ; and Mr. Southgate for other parties. The VIC1-CHANCELLOB (after stating the above facts) now said that it was contended on the part of the defend. ants that the plaintiff could not claim any charge upon Glen's real estate, by reason of the proviso of the statute 2d and 3d of Victoria, c. 37, s. 8, which invalidated tha loan of money upon secmuity of land. The question then was, what was the true construction of that statute?' To arrive at that it was necessary to look at ths general laws of usbry. The statute of Anne rendered void every loan of money at more than 5 per cent. interest and then by the statute 3d and 4th of William IV., cap, 53 section 7, renewable bills and promissory notes, having no; more than three months to run, were exempted from those lavws; but by the 7th of William IV., and the 1st of Victoria cap. 28, that exemption was extended to bils having not more than 12 months to run; but that was onlya temporary Act, and its place was afterwards supplied by the 2d and 3d of Victoria, cap. 32, section 8, upon which this case turned. The proviso in that Act prevented a oharge upon land being taken as it might have been under the statute of William IV. (It mattered ne how the charge was sought to be obtained); the word "security" was large enough to cover every kind of assurance affecting land. Now, It appeared tohis Honour with respect to the present case, that tho only questionr wa whether a judgment was a security upon land, and itwa necessary to consider that question both previously and sub sequently to the passing of the 1 and 2 of Victoi I l Before the passing of that Act his Honour thouehP p that a judgment was not a security on land, but since the I passing it clearly was so. Before that statute a judgment was often spoken of as a general lien on the general property of the debtor, but this only meant that by the writ Of dekd* the creditor could get possesEion of the land, and the debtor could not withdraw his land from the effect of thoe writ. Before the statute 1ss and 2d Victoria, cap. 110, therefore, a judgment was not properly a security upon land; but that act gave a totailly new quality and nature to a judgment. But by the 13th section ajudgment was made a charge on all the lands of the debtor in the same way; as if the debtor had by writing under his hand agreed to charge hi-s landls. Ajudgment, therefore, has not only retained its ancient quality, hut also by virtue of that statute acquired the new qualty of being a charge upon lands, and this was the effect, erntirely, independent of the intention of the parties, This view of the subject was confirmed by Lord St. Leonard's, Now, if a loan to A or a written agreement to charge all his Iads would be a loan of money on the siecurity of lands, the conclusion seemed inevitable that now a loan upon an agreement for a judgment was also a loan upon the security of lands, This was a case of a warrant of attorney to confess judgment. There were several dicta of commnon law judges, in vwhichL a distinction was taken between a judgment and a Warrant of attorney to confess judgment, the later not being thought by them to be a scurty upon land properly speaking. aB take the case of an ageement to give an equitable charge by deposit of deeds Whic were In the hands of somne third person, and we had an exactly analogouz case to the present ; for a warrant of attorney was an agreement that the creditor might, by entering up judgment, obtain a charge upon lands, Thereforn the warrant of attorney to contess judgment, taken as a security for the repayment oF money advanced at a usuriouB interest, was a security or charge upon lands within the meaning of the statute 2d and 3zd of Victoria, cap. 37, see. 8. TChis view of the subject was confirmed by several cases, such as "Al Kinight" (l, Deac., 493'), "Exsea,-te Warriopton" (8 De Gex, Mac and Cord), and "James v. Rice" (Kay, 231). Tki grounds of the judgment of the House of Lords in " Land v. Eorlocl;" (e Ch. and Fin.), although at first sight apparenu,ly opposed to this decision, In reality, upon examination, was found to confirm that view. For these reasons his Honours opinion was that the bill ought to be dismised ; but co sidering the difference of judicial opinion whIch ha pro. vailed upon the subject, without costs.

Simpson followed the Attorney-General on behalf of the company. Mr. CAINS replied upon the whole case, and after adverting to the vanous grounds of defence which had been raised, contended that the charges of fraud which had been so profusely scattered were in no wiay substantiated. What fraud was there on the part of Sir Richard Bromn and Sprye inreferenceto theagreement of April, 1851? What re. presentation was made to the provisdonal trastess who contracted on behalf of the company which wasnot strictly tmre? What circuLmstanco was concealed from them? Where wAs the proof of this alleged conspiracy, as to which so much had been said, while the evidence showeed that the vendors and purchasers had on elther side used their utmost endeavours to obtain the best terms for themselves. Though Lord Onslow night have wished to repudiate his agreement with Broun and Sprye, it did not therefore follow that they were not acting bmond JIde They might well think that they could hold Lord Onslow to his bargain with them, and that they had a good equitable title to the land. If the agree. ment were so whoUy inequitable, why had not the company filed a cross bill to have it set aside and favoured the Court with the notioDs of equity and justiee prevailing among the lords of this city of the dead, and what they thought a fair course to pursue towards those who had parted with their interests In favour of the company with. out the slightest recompense? The defenoe set up was unrighteous, dishonest, and disreputable to a plublio company, and had ultterly failed. The YICN-CENCE:LLOR said that he would give judgment on Wednesday next.
COURT OF QUERN'S BENCH. GuimnAmt DR1 1R ILT.A V1. RllRPTTn (S&t#ings at NiIi Prius, beforW Lord CMPXLL and Spec;a Joures.) Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Prentice, and Mr. Woollett appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. W. M. Chambers, Q.C., Mr. HL James, and Mr. Tayler for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover back a sum of money which the plaintiff had been inducedto pay to the defendant by a false representation. The defendant pleaded never indebted and a set-off. The trial of the cause occupied the whole of yesterday, and at the sitting of the Court this day, Mr. CHA.nBEas summed up the evidence for the defendant. Mr. EDIVnw JtAS then replied upon the whole case. Lord CAB sBELL, in summing up, said that, although the trial of this cause had lasted the whole of one long day and part of another, the question at issue lay in a very narrow compass. The action was brought to recover back a sum of 501., orthe greater part of it, upon the ground thabit had been paid to the defendant on a false representation of facts as to the amount due to tho defendant. If the money was so obtained, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover it back, unless the plaintiff was indebted to the defendant in a larger amount in respect of a prosecution which had been instituted against Cutts and Smith, and that prosecution had been instituted by direction of the plaintiff, and upon his credit. The questlon would depend almost entirely upon the credit the jury might give to the witnesses on the one side or the other. If they believed the witnesses for the plaintiff, that the 50L had been paid on a false representa. tion, they ought to find for the plaintiff; unless they should be of opinion that the defendant was entitled to his set-off in ,hich c3se they would fiad for the defendant. As to the 501.,therewasgreat reason for believingthatSmith had given that money to settle all the actions. The defendant himself in his affidavit said that the plaintiff had paid him 501. in relpect of the action for seduction. That was also the aspect which the defendant gave the transactions in his receipt. Was there, then, a false representation that the sum of 501. was due in that action ? All that was due for the legal proceedings was 51. 17s. 2d. The question, then, was whether the defendant looked to the plaintiff, and could charge him with the letters and attendances. If he did not, but looked to the daughter or to Smith, he could not bring them into the action for seduction. Then as to the set-off, the question would be whether the defendant looked to the plaintiff for his costs of the prosecution. His Lordship here observed that he looked with great suspicion on the dealings of the defendant and his clerk, with respect to an acceptance of the plaintiff's which had been put in evidence. According to their evidence it was a bill given for the costs, but his Lordship thought it had more the appearance of a bill given for the accommodation of the defendant. It was accepted by the plaintiff in blank, and filled up by the defendant and mAde payable at some place in London. The plaintiff knew nothing about it, and when it became due no application was made to the plaintiff, but it was taken up by the defendant. The plaintiff and his wife both positively denied that the prosecution was carried on by their direction. The defendant and his clerk, Cardinall, had sworn that the plaintiff had givea directions, but the books contained no entries of attendances a against the plaintiff. The question was whether the plaintiff diected the prosecution and whether the defendant looked to him for payment; or whether he did not look to be paid out of the public revenues, or by Mr. Smith. The jury found for the plaintiff for the amount clamed441. 2s. lOd. CLARK V. DICKSON ATD OTXRSr . Mr. Serjeaut Kinglake, Mr. Phinn, QC., and Mr. Horace Lloyd appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, Q. C., and Mr. l)owdeswell for the defendant, Colonel Dickson; and Sir F. Thedger and MIr. Aspland for the two otber defendants, John Williams and Thomas Gibbes. The plaintiffin this action, Thomas Claric, was surgeon to the Doncaster Dispensary, and the defendants were Colonel S. A. Dickson, of Grafton-street, Berkeley-square, John Williams, of Middleton-plwce, Stoke Newington, and Thomas Gibbes, a stockbroker in Throgmorton-street. The plaintiff was the holder of 340 shares in the Welsh Potosi Lead and Copper Mining Company, of which company the defendants were directors, and he brought the present action to recover back the sonu of 1,7001., being the price of the 340 shares, which he had purchased at 51. each. The action was in form for money had and received by the defendants to the plaintiff's use. MIr. Serjeant KINGTA i, in opening the case, stated the Welh Potosl Lead and Copper Ining Company was formed ,n the 2d of September, 1853, upon what was called the cost-book principle. The defendant Colonel Dickson was present at that meeting, at which the company was formed, and the prospectus was agreed upon and ordered to be published. The defendant Gibbes joined in November, and was the stockbroker to the company, and the other defendant joined soon after. The scheme was workedduringthe years 1854, 1S55, and 1856, but in 1857 it wholly failed. It was then registered as a limited company, and ordered to be wound up; and on the 25th ofJuly the whole of the property of the company was aold under the hammer for the sum of 3, 0001. The plaintiffbecame a shareholder in February, 1814, and had since found out that the whole scheme was a fraud from beginning to end, and upon that ground he now sought to recover back the money which he had paid. The prospeetus published by the company contained statements which the directors mnust have known to be false; it also showed a suppression of facts which must have been known to Colonel Dickson, if not to the other defendants; and upon that ground he (the learned serjeant) contenaded that in point of law the plaintwff would be entitled to recover ack his money. Lord CAa11PeBELL here intimated that the plaintiffcould not treat the contract as void after he had acted upon it. MIr. Serjeaut Ki-oLAKE proceeded to give a minute history of the Welsh Potosi Lead and Copper Mine, which he said was situated in Cardiganehire, between Aberystwith Land Machynileth, and nine miles from the port of Aberdovey. The prospectus represented that as much as 50,0001. had already been laid out in sinking shafts, &c., "of which the present company will have the fnUl and immediate benefit; and it stated that the directors had made arrangementsfor he purchase of the property for 5,0001. and 5,000 shares, being equal to a total of 30,0001. It turned cout, however, that the whole of the property was not worth mnore than 1,40.U. or 1,5001., as was well known to Colonel Dickson, who, together with one T. W. Wilkinson, the purser and nianacer, had conducted the company at the office of Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, in Walbrook, It would appear that Colonel Dickson had shared the money and sharrs vithWilkinson, and that they were the only persons who had derived any benefit from the company. The learned serjeant here said that the] projectors had met with an old book in the British Museum, written by one Sir Carberry Price, and published in 1698, and also another work, written by a Mr. Waller, On tfhe WeVsh PotosiM nes, and they bad pubHshed extracts from these books in their rospectus, which, the learned serjeant said, were cAlon. l'ated to deceive and delude the public. Lord COAWPBELL said the law made a contract obtained by a false representation voidable; but if the party acted upon it, though he might maintain an actIon for the false representation, he couldi not treat the contract as void. That was the doctrine which had been laid down recently by the Court of Qaeen's Bench in the case of " The Deposit and General Life Assurance Company v. Ascough" (26LJ., Q.B., 29), and he (Lord Campbell) should adhere to that doctrine in this case. Sir F. TnIEsinER said the plaintIff had acted upon the contract, and paid money as a contributory. Lord CAMP'BELL said the plaintiff might have an action for breach of contract or for the deceit, but he could not disaffirm the contract. Mr. Serjeant KINGLARE then appled for'leave to add a count for the false representation. The defendants had not been at all misled. Sir F. TisiSGEiR said that would be quite a fresh action, and he should want time to plead. Lord CAMaPBELL said he could not grant leave to amend witbout requiring the plaintiff to pay aU the costs which hadl been incurred, and that would be the same as a -nonsuit. His Lordship then directed tho plaintiff to be nonsuited, which was done accordingly. TURciER (ADcMINISTRATRLC) V. THE SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY COMIPANY. Mr. Edwini Jamles, Q.C., and Mr. Raymond appeard for the plaintiff; andMxr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. T. Jones for the defendant. The plaintiff inthtis action, Ann&aMas-,a Turner, was the widow and adesinistratrix. of Thomas W. W. Turner, a hairdresser, formerly carrying on business in St. Mary's.hiU, Eastcheap; and she sued the South-Eastern Railway Com- any to recover compensation Iandamages for the loss of her tusbanud, killed inx the collision which took place on the Company's line at Lewishar on the 28th of June last. The public has already become too familiar with the particulars of this frightful accident. It will therefore be unnocessary to go into anAy details. Scffice it to say that the plaintiff's hustnd was kUled on the spot; and, as the company admitted the negligence, the only question now was as to the amount of damages the plaintiff ought to recover. The plaintiff, who was a young woman only 25 years of age, with one child, stated that her husband was 27 years of age, and that his gross income from his business was from 41. to 51. a-week. Out of this he had to pay an assistant aud other expenses, which made his clear incomno about 1201, a-year. Mr. Marshall, an actuary, was caUed ar,d stated that 2 000'. would secure a p?raon ot the platntiff's an an anzMit F 1201., and the pl.lnt ff s counsel suggea that about Ulf that sum wonuld be a buitable compensation. Mr. Serjeant SiIEE, in addressing the jury for the defendants, said the actuary had been obliged to admit that he had no means of ascertaining the value of an income of 1201. arising from trade; and the learned serjeant saug. gested that 300l. or 4001. vould be amle compengation to the plaintiff for tho pecuniry loss wlach she had sustained hy her husbaed's death. Lord CAIPB}ELL. in summing up, said that ln estimating the damages the jury must look only at the plaitiff's pecuniary loss, and not at the mental suffering which she had 8ustai3ed. The jury retired, and after about an hour's absence, the foreman of the jury came into corrt and said 11 of the ury.- men were agreed, but there was no probablity of the 12th coming to an agreement. Mr. JAXES said he was quite wllling to take the verdict of the 11. jurymen. Mr. Serjeant Sass, howerer, wahed the jury to be further locked up. Lord CAosrIPBLL said he should feel it his duty, after a time, to discharge the jury, and then thore wonld be the exuense of another triaL. Mr. Serjeant SHEE then consented. The foreman, who had kept his counsel up to that time, then left the. court, saying the learned serjeant had done a very wise thing. (Laughter.) dhe tury having come into court, they found their verdict for the plaintiff, with 6001. damages, which they a portioned thus--3501. to the mother, and 2501. to the child, Mr. Serjeant SuEn said, that was the exact sum the company had offered. (Laughter). We understand the dissatis-ed jurSmnn wished to give 8001. damiages. BITXS (DUBLIC OM=ICER) V. SUR A. I.L ELTON. Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. Unthank appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Coliier, QC., and Mr. Blaine for the defendant. Tbis was an action, brought by the public officer of the West of England and South Wales Banking Compiny, against Sir A. H. Elton, the Sherif for the county of SomerE6t, to recover damages for an escape. The defendant had paid 40s. into court, aid alleged that the plaintiff had not sustained damage beyond that sum. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that on the nth of July last the plaintiff had signed judgment against Lord Cecil Gor. don for the sum of 981. odd; and that on the 16th of July his Lordship Was arrested by the defenmant's officer, under a Ca. sa., in a racket-court at Bath. The officer, at the request of his prisoner, took him to the office of Mr. Hale, a solicitor, at Bath, who was also his Lordshlp's personal friend; and it was there agreed that Leid CeI Gordon should he set at liberty upon Mr. Hale's giving a check for the amount of the judgment, and an undertaking that Lord Cecil Gordon should asurender himself when called upon. The reason for this arrangement was stated to be that his Lordship's friends were more likely to assist him if he were at lber ty than if they knew he was in prison. Under this agrcement Lord Cecil Gordon remained at large til the 1st of August, when he was arrested under the Absconding Debtors Act and thrown into prison. He then petitioned the Coart and was discharged in due oourse. Evidence was given to show that if the defendant had done his duty and kept his prisoner the latter had property and would in all probab ty had made an arrangemenz to discharge tho plaintiff's claim. ir. Collins, the sheriff's officer, said,-I arrested Lord Cecil Gordon on the 16th of July at a racket court at Bath. I then proceeded with him to Mr. Hale's oflice. Mr. Hale was his attorney. It was about mid-day. An arrange. ment was made between me and Mr.Hale about his lordship's being set free. Mr. Hale wished me to give some time that be might have an opportunity of writing to his lordship's friends, to see if he could get some money. Mr. Hale said he would give mea check and an undertaking for the pro. duction of his body, and I wxs to give the obeck back on his rendering hie body. The terms were agreed to and the checkgiven. (The undertaking was put in and read.) I then allowedhis Lordship to go free. Before the 1st of August he was apprehended under the Absconding Debtors Act. My brother, on the 3lst of July, gave the warrant to Mr. Hale. I gave the cheek back. Hearing that his lord. ship was in custody, and that the warrant had been glven to Mr. Hale, I returned the check. Cross-examined -Lord Cecil Gordon did not leave Bath between the 16th and 31st of July. A day or two after the 16th of July I told the plaintiff what I had done, He said, You know your duty." Lord Cecil Gordon said,-I resided at Bath in July last. I remember being taken into custody on the 16th of July. Mr. Hale was more a friend than a legal adviser. I called on him, and I told him I thought the family would come forward if "he could stave it off. They had done so before. I wrote to my friends a day or two before. I was aware that judgment had been signed. I was not present when tho arrangement was made. Mr. Hale came in to me and said, " You are now under my charge." I went away. I was taken on the 1st of August. I was not about to leave the country. Lady Cecil had left on the 31st of July. I took the benefit of the Act in October. I petitloned soon after I was taken, and was discharged in due course. I recelvec a check for 501, from my brother on the 29th of July. There was also a sum, of 251., which was made pay. able to mny wife. The 501. 1 received frora my brother, the Marquis of Huntley. I had books and other articles valued at 1001. I deposited them with Mr. Weston on the morning of the 31stofJuly preparatory to following my wife or giving myself up. Mr. Weston was a friend and creditor. I did not dIposit the goods as security, but to hold for me or the oreditors. Mr. Rennie valued them at 6. 1ls. 8d. He valued for the Court. I had also some household goods and fumriture. They were sold after the 16th of July. I value them at 151. There was also my gold watch, worth 151. or 161. Some extra clothes were sold for W5. Cross-examined.-The whole of the property was given up for the benefit of creditors. The 501. I reoeived to take Lady Cecil away. I have nine children. On the 16th of July I was not able to satisfy this claim without the assistance of my relations. I was not less able to pay through being aUowed to go. at large. I told Mr. Hale I had written to my friends for assistance, and that they would be more lik-ely to assist me If I were let go at large than if I were arrested. I said I was quite sure that if they beard I was in gaol they would not assist me. It was part of the arrangement that I was to go at large on my parole, end surrender myself when called upon, lMr. Hale did not call upon me to surrender. On the 1st of August Mr. Hale came with the warrant, and deslred the gaoler to keep me under that warrant, as well as under the County Court warrant. Re-examined.-I did not wzrite for assistance to pay this debt, but to pay al the creditors. I got the 501. check cashed, and gave the money to my wife. Mr. COLLIER then addressed the jury for the defendant, and contended that the pldntIff bad not susained any damage by the act of the sheriffs officer. Lord CAPBZLL left it to the jury to say whether the plaintiff had sustained any damage beyond the sum of 40s., which had been paid into court. The jury found that he had not. Lord CAMPBELL said that was substantially a verdict for the defendant. 5MW51ARD V. REATI. Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Salter appeared for the plaintiff;andlMr.EHuddleston, Q.C., andAL-. F. Russell for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, R. hMilward, was a rotired publican and money lender, residing at Htammersmith, and he sued the defendant, H. B. Heath, who was also a money lender and surgeon dentist, in the Edgeware-road,to recover the sum of 27n. s., under the count for money received by the defendant to the plaintiffs use. The derendant pleaded the general issue and a set-off. It was admitted that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, unless the defendant could establish his plea of set-off; and the question on this part of the case depended upon whether or not the defendant had lent the plaintiff a sum of 751. It appeared that the plaintiff and defendant had joined in a loan of some money upon a 3001. bill; but when the bll became due it was dishonoured. However, a writ was issued against one of the parties to the bUIl, and a sum of 1501. was paid; and, according to the plaintiff's case, it was agreed that the plaintiff should have the whole of this sum, and that the defendant should have the biU and some securities deposited with it, and look to the parties for the balance. This was, however, denied by the defendant, who posA. tlvely swvore that he advanced his moiety of the 1601. to tho plaintiff as a loan. The evidence of the defendant was confirmed by his wife, who was present at the interview. Lord CA,PBELL left it to tho jury to say which side they believed, and the jury, without hesitation, found for the defendant. SECOND COURT. (Bcfore Mr. J.usticc :ERT xandCominon Juris.) SAIeDON v. DAIN AND ANOTHER. Mr. Huddleston and Mar. Gibbons were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Sesjeant Plgott and Mr. Scotland appeared for the defendants. This was an action of trover for certain goods. The deferdants pleaded " Not Guilty" by statute. It appeared that the plaintiff Is an architect and surveyor, residing at Rageley, In Staffordshire. Some time since he purchased a quantity of wine from Messrs. Burleigh, of uondon, wine merchants. Not having been able to disposo of it, and being involved in consequence of somne Chancery proceedings, he was unable to pay, and they obtained judgment against him. A ca s. was placed in the hands of the defendant Dain, who is a sherift's officer, for execution. The plaintiff, In order to avoid arrest, kept his house shut up, and succeeded in his object for some time. On the 28th of Augast, between 4 and 5 in the af teroon, the family were at tea in the front room, they saw a sheriff's officer named Woolridge, whom they knew to be employed by Mr. Dain, coming towards the house with a ladder on his shoulder. M Sandon cried out that the window upstairs was open. Her daughter at once ran up, and, according to the ovldence of the plaintif's witnesses, had succeeded in closing it before Woolridge had got to the top of the ladder, which he placed against the house. He attempted to force in the e plaintiff came up and caught hold of the fastening. The moment Woolridge saw him he dashed his hand through the glass, and, touchig him, cried out, "Yon are my prisoner." He then got off the ladder, and af ter a I short time he and Dain returned and broke in the £ront door of the house. Sandon wvas arrested and carrled off tol Stafford gaol, where he still remains. As soon aa Dain got into the house he produeed a distr warrant for 161. arrears of rent, and commenced taking an inventory. When he retired he left a man named Woodhonsein possession. After some time Woodchouse went awvay About 11 o'clock, after thehouse had been shut up, and Mrs. Sandon and her daughter were in bed, Woolridge came and demanded admittance, statinq he was the man in pomession. Mrs. Sandon refused. On this he broke the back door and forced his way in. After he had effcted an entrance he conducted himself In a most outrageons maanner. It was I stated he had only just come out of gaol and was a most I improper person to he intrusted with the duties ofsa sheriff's oflicer. The furniture was eventually sold by the other defendant, Mr. Fortoicue, who s an auctioneer at Bugs $Y. F"or the Plxaitiff it was conUneded that, tuder the cirom - tances stated by his witne&eOs, the original entry of the defendant Daim was illegal ; that, consequetly, he Jhad no right to make the distress, and wa ibeI* hsato o the conTersion of the goods. For the defence it was stated that Dain had fora long time been endealvourig to ezecute the writ against the plasinti and kept a watch on the house. On the afternoon of the th of Augtut he saw the upper window open, and at once direoted his maot Woolhidge to got a ladder and smnake aetry. The witnese ao stated that WoQiridge rean te idder and had got to the too and plaosd his baLnd inside before the window was close; a Aruggle took plaoe, the plaintiff came uap, and in assisting his daughter broke the glass ; he pn his hand out to throw the ladderdown,andthe moment ha did so Woolrldgetonched him and declaredl howsaron. Woolrldge'then re. tired, and after a short tm anndhreause and broke in the door, as they wre rfectly entitled to do, he having once made the arrest, When the defendant had got in for the purpose of completing the arrest he produed hdistreEs warrant and made the seizure of the furniture Wo i ridge remained inpoesin AtngtM.Sadnol him that her daughtr eegigaa osep efl lowed them out to get sm ersmn,laigtebc door open. When. he returnedh on hyhdcm hack. They began to make a nos and hecle oie man. He then went in through the backoor Mr. Justice Escnu in summing np said, that the jury In considering the question of damages should recollect that the defendant Forutescue, who had nothing to do with the transaction except selling the goods in his capacity of auctioneer, was equally liable with D)ain to the consequenices of their verdict. The qnestion to be considered wswhether Woolrldge had got his hand inside the windowwafore it was closed and touched Sandon, or the latter hadput his and outside; in either case a captren would have been made, and the sheriff and his officers would have been responsible if they had not followed it up If thy beieed that either of these events bad occurred they ouht to find for the defend. ants, but if, as was alleged by paintiff and ms witfiesses, Woolridco had broken the window, and only touched Sandon inside the house, then there was no justification of the defendant' subsequent acts, an they should find against thema. The ijny retired, and, after a sort absence, retaned into court and stated they were 10 to 2. There was no chaine of their agreeafg, and they wished to know wbether his Laord. ship would take the opinion of the majority, Th. Justice Entre said, he could not hear anything about their division. If they wished to ask any questions, or han e any of the evidence read, he would hear them; but if no; they had better retire and talk the matter over. In about two hours the jury senit word that they were 11 to 1, and that there was no chance of their agreeing. After some discussion the parties consented to adopt his Lordship's suggeston, and withdraw ajnuror. the] ury were then dischargedl. PRESTON v. rEEKyP Wben this case was called on only nine jurors answered. The parties agreed to try with that number. Mr. Skinner and Mr. Cleasby were counsel for the plata. tiff Mr. Edward James and Mr. Stammers appeared for the defendant. This action was brought to recover damages for the breach of an sageement to indemnify. It appeared that the plaintiff is a broeker carrying on buso. ness in Wych-street. The defendant is a woollendraper I Ludgate-street, and the owner, among other property, of house in the Strand occupied as a publlchouse, and called the Spotted Dog. In December, 1850, the tensant Wilson was in ahrear of rent, and the defendant gave thte plainti- a wartant to distrain, with the usu indemnity on the back. The PLaintiff entered on the 1st Of January, and he found a broker named .Price in posessiont for the Queen's taxes. on the 7th the plaintiff proceeded to condemn. The defendant wishedhim to include the bar counter and fittings. The plaintiff was doubtful of his right to do so, and did bnot consent until he got a farther specific indemnity. Price refused to ailow plsintiff to remove the counter until his claim was saisfied. The defendant accordingly gave him a check for 1 c On the 10th of January Wilson served a notice on thesplaintiff and the defendant that they were acting illegaly, but the thdnogs were removed and sold. Wilson then commenced an action against both. Peeke said he would defend it; for some reason it was discontinued and a now one commenced, which came on for trial on the 13th of June before Mur. Baron Martino- the jadge considered that the parties had no right to seize toe counter, andlt directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The verdict was entered against Preston, but the learned judge held Mp. Peeke was not liable in that action; the verdict was entered for him, but a certificate was given to deprive him of his costs. The costs and damages amounted to 1454; Preston not being able to pay was arrested he remained in prison for eome time, until he arranged to pay by instalments. While he was in prison Mr. Peeke went to his father, and offeredl that if plaintiff would take the benefit of the Insolvent Act to deprive Wil-son of his damnages and costs, he would retain counisel to get him through the court, and giehim 1001. whenL he came out. This offer was refused, 9andthe plaintiff brought this action to recover the amount he had been forced to pay. For the--defence It was contendedathat the general indeminity was only against any libility arising by reason of the landlord not having a right to distrain ; the particular indemnity in this case was in general words, anad could not be construed as indemnifying -Preston against the consequences of the acts complained of by Wilson, wvhich were that he had cut away the bar counter and fittings, and sold without prope notice ; these were ilegal acts of the p laintiff, beyond hi authority' and he had no right to ask Peeke to indemnify him against the consequences of them. The defendant was called.-He statedi that he hida never beenL asked about the bar counter. He had not directed the removal of it. He gave th-e second Indemnity to protect Preston for holding over after the notice of the 10th of January. He denied that he hadl ever requested the plaintiff to take the beniefit of the Insolvent Act. Mr. Justice Eix.s having summed up, The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 1501.
COUPRT OF COMbON PLEAS. DEC.. 1R COMTERILL V. RIEAT NOTR'PTTVV -- R i. (Siting3 at Nis Prius at GulUdhaM, before Lord Ohief Justicc CoCEKB1U and a SDeciat Jtlr1- I air. Edwvin James, Q.C., and Mr. H-awkins were counse1 for ithe plaintiff; Ir. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. Brewer ap. peared for the defendants. This was an action brought to recover damages for injuriesasutained by a horse belonging to the plaintiff during the journey from Spalding to Peterborough on the defendants' line. The defendants pleaded that the horse was carried by them on the condition that they were not to be liable for any accident which might occur by reason of the animal kicking or plumging. By the 7th section of the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chapter 31, it is provided that railway companies are to be liable for neglect or default in the carriage of goods notwithstanding notice to the conirazy, and notwithstanding that thoy accept goods for carriage on certain conditions only, unless the Court is of opinion that such conditions are reasonable and unless a spocii contract is made; and by the same section it Is enacted that no special contract shall be binding unless signed. The liability of the company is limited to 501. in h case of injury to a horse, unless the value is declared nd an extra sum paid for the carriage, And the present action was brought under this Act, which is entitled, " An Act for the Better Regulation of the Traffic on Railways and Canals." No special contract had been made, and it appeared that on the 13th of Jume last the plaintiff caused to be delivered at the station at Spalding a valuable roan horse for carriage to London; that at the Peterborough station it was found (in the box into which it had been put) with one leg over a partition, and the other over the rope by which it vas fastened to the manger, considerably injured in that portion of the inner side of the foreleg which is the usual site of wounds from speedy cut. It cost 65!., and was as soon as it recovered sold for 100?. Mr. Cotterill, howvever, said that but for the accident he could have got 120l. for the animal, and he now sought to recover the expenses of its keep and cure, and also damages for its deterioration in value. It was said by the plaintff, but denled by the company, that it had been improperly secured in the horsebox, and that the halter used wras much too long for the purposes of security, and evidence of a very contradictory nature was given in support of each viewF, and by the defendants the unfortunate occurrence was attribuited to the unruly conduct of the horse Itsel1 The trial lasted dusing a great portion of the day, and eventually a verdict was given for the plaintiff-Damages, 3&, 16s. 3d. SECOND COURT. (Bcforc Mr. J,Usticc CRESSWELL and Common Juria.) ILDERTON V. ANDREIS. Mr. Houi and Mr. Watkin Willams appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. J. H. Browne for the defendant, This was an action on a bill of exchange by an indorsee against the drawer; the only plea was that the defendant had given the bill to a Mr. Castrique to discount for him. but that C^atrique never gave him the money for it; and that the bill ;as indorsed to the plaintiff without consideration and weith notice of the circumstauces, The defendant, being called upon to support his plea, the burden of the issue being on him, stated that he was managing clerk to Mr. Nash, an attorney, and wanted funds to proceed with a suit on a policy, and requested Castrique to discount the bill; this was declined, but Castrique advanced 101. on the policy, and said he would inquire about the parties whose names were on the bilL On cross-examination he admitted that Castrique, after he had made inquiries as to the names on the bill, offerod to return the bilM upon the defendant returning the 10. At the conclusion of the defendant's case, Mr. Justice CR&SS WELL sald he thought that the plintiff should show that consideration was given for the bil. This having been proved, The jury returned a verdict for the platntiff. An application was made to the learned judge to ce'tlfy for costs, this being necessary in consequence of the City Small Debts Act. The learned JUDGE said, as this was a mercantile cse, and from the issue raised, he thought It was a fit case to be tned in tho superior court. CLAntKE V. WILCOX. Mr. PetersdorfF, Mr. Beasley, and Mr. Laxton appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Parry for the do. fendant. In this action the plaintiff, a furniture dealer, took in January last some premises in Bell-alley, London.wall, of the defendant, who is a tailor, carrying on business in Moor. gate-street, and the action was brought to recover compen. sation In damages from the defendant for first breaking and entering the plaintiff's premises, seizing lia goods, and ex. polling him; secondly, taking an excessive distres thirdly, that no notice of the distress waa given foourty that there was not wny appraisement of the goocs; fifbhil9, that the goods wero not sold for the best price. he dea leaded, first, " not guilty" ; secondly, that tla3enthff was tenant. and that he distrained for a quartaea rt; na thirdly, that the goods were not the pl'intiffs 'pro. pexty; fourthlg, a traverse of the dIstresP fifthly, leave and license.

COURT OF RIXC.TpcATTOr - - C;Rpnmv V - - (Sittings at Nuii Prius, at Guildhatl, before the Loiu, BARON and Spneciad Jures t Mr. Phinn and ir, Quain were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Locke and Mr. Beasley appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff is a brewer at xewport, am,d this was an action to recover damages from the 'tefende.1t, who is a maltster, on the ground that certain old stale beer, brought for the purpose of mixing with tho nevw beer to suit tbe palates of the Welsh mounttaineers and colliers, did not answer the sample, but was foul, ropy, and oily, and, so far from improving the plaintiff's Oew beer when " married" to it, disagreed with it and the custon,erb, as many of the customers, no doubt, did upon their own mlarriages. The cause ran into two days, but a detailed report of the history of the beer and of the contradic'ions connected with it would be as "stale, flat, and un. profitable" as was the beer itself. It may suffice to say that the jury ultimately found for the plaintiff for 231. 7s. 6d., subject to the return of the casks. THE LONDO-N AND EASTERN BANKING CORPO. RATION V. STEi'IIENS. Mr. Bovill, Mr. Lush, and Mr. Ilonyman appeared for the plaintifTs; Mr. M. Smith and hlr. Maudo were counsel for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiffs sought to recover certain calls and also the sum of t,0111. Gs. 5d. on the bond of the defendant, and on the general balance duo on the account of the defendant on the usual money counts. As to the claim for caUs the plaintiffs had entered a nolle pro. seqjui. As to the claim on the bord, the defendant pleaded, first, that nothing was dne on it; secondly, that no demand had been made for the balance claimed; and thirdly, tbat the plaintiffs were a chartered corporation prohibited by their charter from holding their own shares. and that the bond was executed by the defendant in pur. suance of an arrangement entered into by the plaintiffs and the defendant in fraud of the charter, under which the defendant became the holder of certain shares of the bank in trust for the plaintiffs. MIr. BOVILL, in opening the case for the plaintiffes, stated that they had abandoned tbe claim for the calls, and that the case originally stood for trial at the last Surrey Assizes, but had been deferred, on the application of the defendant, on the ground of the absence of Colonel Waugh and others, who were sworn to be material witnesses for the defence. Whether the defendant was now in a situation to call those gentlemen and to put himself in the box he did not know. On the part of the plaintiffs the case and proof would be very short and simple. The defendant was the manager and a director of the London and Eastern Banking Corpo ration, and the son-in-law of the chairman as well as an a. quaintance of other directors, so that he had full means of becoming acquainted with the history and dealings of the undertaking, which was established in January, 1854, and obtained its charter in January, 1855. For sonme time the shares paid a nominal dividend of 6 per cent., %nd in these shares the defendant no doubt trafficked. On the 22d of Jnly, 1856, he bought 120 shares from an ex-director named Griffiths,. on which 501., or one-half, had been paid up. The defendant, however, had no funds at his disposal, and he drew his cheek on the bank funds for the price, which was 6,0001., which check was transferred to the account of blr. Griffiths, while the shares were transferred to his (the defendant's) account. On these shares the defendant received two dividends, which were entered In his private account, and for these dividends he gave his receiots as the shareholder. When the check was drawn he ought to have given ta the bank some secarity for the amount so advanced to h:m, but he did not do so at that time. When, however, the Royal British Bank failed, he did give to the bank a bond for 12,0001. which was the subject of this action, the residue of the plaintiffs' claim, 111. Gs. 5d., being the balanco on one of the defendant',> many drawing accounts, and the only one which he war singly interested in. The bank, as is well known, got into difficulties early in the present year, and then for the first tisue the defendant tried to shift on the bank the responJIbility in respect of these shares so boughtfrom Mr. Griffiths, and, in order to do so, he ordered the dividends to be entered in another account. When, however, the Oriental Bank undertook to manage the concerns of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation it became necessary to provide funds to nieet its numerous liabilities in India (almost all of its capital having been absorbed by Colonel 'Waugh, whose account was on the wrong side to the extent of 244,0001., the capital being 250,0001.) application was made to the shareholders who, including the defendant,gave promissory notes for the amount of their calls then unpaid; on that oocasion the defendant gave his promissory note for the balance uncaUed for in respect of 172 shares, including these shares of Mr. Griffiths. With respect to the defences set up on the record the plaintiffs would disprove the two first. As to the third he apprehended that even if the facts were true as pleaded, they would not afford any answer to the bond, as it could not be tolerated in a court of justice that a man should set up his own fraud in answer to any demand ; but the facts were not as aleged, and the plea must fall to the ground. The following witnesses were then examined for the plaintiff:- George Clough.-I was clerk in the London and Eastern Banking Corporation. MIr. Stephens was manager and director. He had a drawing account, as had Mr. Griffiths. I kept the journal. This is the ledger kept duri4g the man. agement of the defendant. The balance is 111. 6s. 5d. The last entry is April 11, 1857, and it was made on the 12th. I don't know when he resigned. That balance is exclusive Of the sum of G,0001. This check for that amount was given to me by Mr. Stephens, attached to a voucher which contained directions what to do. I thereupon credited Mr. Griffiths's account with 6,0001., and debited that of Mr. Stephens with 6.0001. This is the entry, " por check cashed," in both caEes; Mr. :;tephens's share account is debited with 6,0001 for 120 shares purchased of Mr. Griffiths. The accoust is headed, " J. E. Stephens, Esq., Six per Cent. sharo account." The item is entered in his floating account first, anI is thence carrled to the share accoant. The signature of Mr. Stephens is attached to these two dividend warrants. The amounts are credited in his dividend account. Cross-examined.-The balance 111. 6s. 5d. was on the de. fendant's current account. When the G,0001. was entered to his debit in the share account there was a credit of 4,9571. in his favour in his current account. The item 6,0001. was entered on both sides, and did not therefore alter its bAlance. I don't know of any other similar accounts to the defendant's share account opened with any other director. George Hlarrison.-I was a clerk of the bank in April, 1857. I then filled up a denmand of payment addressed to the defendant, and sent it to him on the 21st of April last. The amount demanded was 6,0111. 6s. 5d. I made out this maemorandum by order of Mr. Stephens, directing me to enter the items relating to the purchase of the shares from 3ir. Griffiths. In March, 1557, the defendant held 172 shares, inclusive of Mr. Griffiths's shares. This promissoxy note was signed by the defendant in my presence. It is given to the Eastern Bank for 8,6001. due on his shares This is the defondant's signature to a meeting of shareholders, when a resolution was passed relative to the givlng of such notes by shareholders. Cross-examined.-Mr. Stewart, the manager of the Oriental Bank, was appointed, ad inkrcim, general manager of the London and Eastern Corporation. I was the transfer clerk. The certificates of the shares were lodged with me by Mr. Stephens. The bond was dated on the date of the transfer, but was not, in fact, executed till September. The bond is a cash credit bond, and is a printed form. I am bdot aware that its use was con'ned to caeses of hirectors. I beld the certificates of ur. Stephens's other shares when he gave me those for Mr. Griffiths's shares. Griffiths had been a director to July, 1856. Colonel Yates was elected in July, 1856. lxr. Griffiths had no other shares when these were transferred to Mr. Stephens. I don't know from any of the direotors that these shares wore purchased for the bank. Re-exatmined.-All transfers are approved by the directors. There was a resolution to that effect in this case in August, 18:56. Mr. Stephens is registered as the holder of these identical shares, as Griffiths had been. I filed up this bond by order of Stephens just after the failure of the British Bank, and placed it with his private securities. Mr. BOVILL stated that the so called bond was without a stamp or seal and wavs wrorthless. He proposed to call it tho p;ece of paper. The CuIEF BARoN.-You may call it a bond, or by any other name, as you may call a piece of metal a "bad shlling." Mr. M. SoIM=rs read the redtals of the Instrument, showing that the bank had " consented to advance money to the defendant in some ons or more of the ways common to bankers," He submitted that the plaintiffs could not recover on the accounts declared on under this alleged bond. The Cius BAPoq.-I think the plaintiffs may recover on any account. Mr. Mi. Smrrs, at the close of tbe plaintiffs' case, briefly addressed-the jury to the effect that, though he had certain evidence which he might adduce in support of the third plea, yet, as Mr. Stephens himself was not present, he did not think his case would be strong enough to warrant him in caling upon the jury to find that plea for him. As to the two others, it seemed to be admitted that the verdict mnst also be found for the plaintiffs. The CHIEF BARON said, that the learned counsel was juite correct ia stating that very strong evidence would be required in support of a plea of fraud set up by the defend ant in his own favour. As, moreover, no evldence at all was to be tendered in support of it, and it was admitted that the plaiDtiffs were entitled so a verdict on the other pleas, aU that the jury would have to do would be to find a verdict generally for the plaintiffs for 6,0111. 6s. 5d., the ba. lance claimed by the plaintiffs. The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiffs, Th C}ITS B,IRON certified for a special jury, and granted immediate execution.
ADMIRALTY COURT, DEC. 18. - a 1 8.- (Before Dr. LUsRIsGTox.) This vwas an action for damiage brought by the owners of the brig Georgina against those of the ship Linda. The Cse was argued on the last court day, wben the Trinity Brethren came to the conclusion that both of the vessels were to blame for the collision. The Georgina having been abandoned by the master and crew after the coUision, but found after the abaudonment by another vessel, taken to adeira, repaired, and broug,ht back to Eagland, the question ouf consequential damage was now brought before the Tre ADMIRALTY ADVOCAT and Dr. SPIiris, on behalf of the Linda, contended that there was no niecessity for the abandonment of the Georgina, and prayed the Court to pronounce against the claim. Dr. ADDAIS and Dr. Twrss were heard upon the other tide. The TRINITy BRETHRE-N were of opinion that the abandonment of the Georgina was, under the circumstances, unjustifiable, and that a master of ordinary skill and ordinary courage would have attempted to salve the vessel, and would probably have been successful if he had accepted the assistance offered. The Co uRT accordingly refused the application for consequential damage with costs.
COURT OP BANKBUPTCY, BasinghalC-stred, Dec. 18. IR RE WILUAl,1 SMITII-TITE TIWtIrt. FTP1"Z'r nsA (Before Mr. CommuiSoi&er FAN'R I The bankrupt, in conjunction with Mr.Whittingstall, was a banker at Homel Hempsted. Mr. Whittingstall died some short time before the suspension of the bank ; the question arose whether his executors were liable for the debts of the bank. Mr. IaNKCLATER, for the assignees, said the result of proceedings thus far in Chancery was an arrangement which, wben ratified by the coneent of the large number of creditors, warranted the belief that the creditors would ultimatelv receive a dividend little short of 20s. in the pound. Time was necessary to carry out this arrangement, and without attributing the delay that must thus occur in any respect to Mr. Smith, but rather, on the contrary, from a feeling of kindness to him, it was desirable that the present meeting should be adjourned until the arrangement had been completed. The assets in hand were not sufficient for a dividend, and in the present state of the money-market it would not be advantageous to proceed to a sale of the bankrupt's estate. Mr. BAGLEY, for the bankrupt, consented, and an ad. journment was ordered to the 24th of April. IN RE TlRO2IAS HART. The bankrupt carried on business in Blackfriars.road under the style of the Hat and Cap Comlpany. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Norton, for the assignees, did not oppose; Mr Lawrance supported; Mr. WiUiam Jones (King's Armsyard), opposed for Mr. Ashley, pawnbroker. The proceedlngs after a short tinme took so wrangling a turn-a turn in which, from the senior wrangler to the junior wrangler-from the learned Commissioner to tho witness-each had so much to say, that the only form in which the case admits of notice is that of a descriptive summary:- The bankrupt, it appeared, failed some five or six years ago. He then received a first-class certificate. His unsecnred debts now exceed 2,0001L, and an offer of 6s. Sd. in the pound not having been accepted under a private composition the dividend wiU be considerably less under a public bankruptcy. Although the Hat Company had no less than six shops, one hat, it appeared, sufficed to cover the heads of all the members of the firm. Mr. Ashley had the good or il fortune to meet the bankrupt at a private party about a year ago. The bankrupt was very friendly and familiar. He shortly after began to borrow money from Mr. Ashley, and accost the lender by the very familiar appeUation of " Tom." Mr. Ashley was pleased to allow this gracious intimacy to continue until the London Hat and Cap Company was his debtor for about 1,0001. A further loan of 2001. was then asked. Mr. Asbley thought he had advanced enough. Mr. lart, however, suggested that if the aidvance were granted it could be made the means of securing the past debt. He would go to a solicitor who,ppon the advance of the 2001., should be allowed to issue writs upon bim (Elart) to the amount of upwardsof 1,0001., and upon which judgmnent and execution could at any moment be entered. The solicitor naturally enough inquired "Can Hart be trusted ?" This would appear to have been answered in the affirmative, for the transaction was completed. The result, however, was, that upon Mr. Ashley threatening to enforce his claim, the bankrupt dissented 'u unless all his other creditors were paid." This proposal was declined. Then followed the bankruptcy. The ComiqusisoNER did not think thar he could grant a first-class certificate to a man who had habitually borrowed money at 10 and 12~ per cent. He might, however, take one of the secoad-class. Certificate accordingly. IN BE JOHN FAITH. The bankrupt Is described as a provision merchant, of No. 4, Cambridge-road, Mile-end. His accounts, as prepared by Messrs. Batler and Cannings, extend over a period of one year and eight months. They show debts nd liabUities to the amount of 13,6001., and of which 6,G001. are unsecured, and assets about 7001., exclusive of propertv held by creditors as partiaUy eecured. There Is an item of 2,3001. defiCiency at the commencement of the accounts; also, an acknowledgment of 1,0001. as derived from the separate income of Mrs. Faith, per her trustees, Mr. LINKRLATER, for the assignees, did not object, and the bankrupt passed his examination. IN RE B. SIn-IT. The bankrupt was a farmer, &c., and Is connected by relationship with partners in the Hastings Bank of the same name. He now passed his examination, Mr. A. Tarner, for the assignees, consenting.
INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, Dec. 18. MN 'RV .T TT T.T?aA-T (Before the CHIEF CONMMTISONEmT This Insolvent, a retired master of the Royal Mavy, ap. plied to be discharged. Mr. Macrae opposed. The Insolvent bought an oil and colour business in Eent. street, Southwark, for6Sl.,for which he paid in cash251. and a bill for 401. Re alleged that the vendor was to pay the finst half-quarter's rent, amounting to 31. lOs., which he did not do, and the landlord put in a distreFs for the amopnt, under whieh all the goods upon the prenmises were seized. The Insolvent subsequently brought an action against the broker, and recovered a verdict for 651. damages. When the bill of exchange fell due it was in the hands of Yx. May, the landlord, who brought an action, to which the insolvent pleaded, but a judgment was given by his attorney without, as he declared, any sanction on his part. Mr. MACRAE, on behalf of Mr. May, asked that some portion of the insolvent's half pay might be set aside for the payvient of the debts. The CniIiF COCmissioON, refused to make any order, as Mr. MIay had not ventured to appear In court to state how the bill got into his hands, as he had been invited to do bytthe statementslIn the schedule. The insolvent bad beenin custody since the 1st of June, and must now be (Before Mr. Commissioner hlURPIIY.) IN RE JOIIHN WELCII. This insolvent, who had kept a publichouse at Farnham, called the Jolly Farmers (said to be the birthplace of Willam Cobbett), was opposed by Mr. Sargood. The opposition was mainly upon the ground that certain property, which had been removed to a publichouse at Aldershott, belonged to the insolvent. He swore, however, that it was the property of a woman named Bentley, who had passed as his wife, and in this he was confirmed by her evidence to-day, She also stated that she had purchased the ground at Aldershott upon which a publichouse had been built, and the insolvent swore that he knew nothing of that purchase. Otherevidence was called which negatived the last statement. The CoaiSissione hought thore was no reason for a remand. If the insolvent had spoken untruly he could be indicted for perjury. He would therefore be discharged forthwith.

Onx Ibis way he heard a cry close to him of " Hallo, I say " and turning round to see what it was a man's arm. was suddenly thrown round his neck, and the person doing It stuck his knee in his back and rendered him powerless. At tho samne instant another man rifled his pockets of his purse, containing two sovereis and 19s. 6d. in silver. The man who had got the money then ran away. The other man held him about half a minute until the other had got some little distance, and then loosed hold of him and also ran. The prosecutor immediately followed, and never lost sight of either of them, and was perfectly certain as to the identity of both the prisonors. lie was perfectly cool and sober at the time, and although the robbery was only the affair of a moment ho distinctly saw the man who robbed him, who was the prisoner Cook, and he was within twom yards of the other man when he followed him.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS. , Fiday, DMc. 18. (Before Mr. CREAsY, at ClerkenwlM.) Hugh Brady, formerly a constable of the H division, No. 185, who had been brought in custody from Dablin upon a Judge's warrant to take his trial, was indicted with George Queenby, police-constable, 125 H, who surrendered, for having, on the 8th of July last, unlawfully and maliciou.4y inf'icted grievous bodily harm upon Diedrich Ihe prosecutor upon the present occasion, it will be remembered, was tried for an assault upon the two constables, row the defendants, and acquitted, on the ground that they I ad been guilty of bratality to him, and had acted greatly in excess of their duty. Brady was allowed to resign; Queenby was retained, pending this triaL ir. Sleigh, who defended the prosecutoron his trial, and Mir. Lawrence were for the prosecution; Mr. Metcalf, appeared for Brady; and Mr. Ribton defended Queenby. Mr. SLEIGHI, in opening the case, said it involved an in. quiry of the gravest possible cbaracter, both as regarded the interests of the public at large and the conduct of the police force of the metropolis. That force was composed of a body of men who were exposed to considerable danger in bhe discharge of their duty, aud the law very properly surrounded them with great protection, and inflicted severe iunishment on persons who improperly interfered with them or prevented their performing their office; but, on the other hand, when they were found scandalously abusing the powers which were vested in them, the law also afforded the means of bringing them to punisbment. In this case he was afraid he should have to lay before the jury such a state of facts as could leave no doubt that the two defendants, while acting as policemen, had been guilty of most disgraceful conduct, first to a marfied woman, and then to her husband when the latter threa-ened to report such conduct at the station, iLiiicting such injury upon him that he was disabled for many weeks, and was still suffering from the effects of their violence. If this were proved the jury would do their duty and find them guilty, without regard to the consequences, although they were officers charged with the protection of the property and interests of the public. The Prosecutor.-I am a bag-maker, and reside at No 9, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel I have resided there some years, and my name is on the outer door. On the 8th of July last I went with some friends to a German festival held at Highbury-barn, and I, my wife, her sister, and friends returned home in cabs betWeen 3 and4 next morning. We all got out near Whitechapel Church, about four minutes' walk from my house. A young woman was with us, and my wife and her sister went to see her home. While waiting for their return I heard an altercation in Hope-street, close to my house, and on going there I found the defendant Brady, the policeman on duty, and my wife and her sister. My wife com. plained to me that Brady had insulted her, and had thrown her cape over her head. She said he had called her a soliciting prostitute. I said " Why did you do that ?" He said "1 What is that to you ? I'll give you a spank on the face." I then told my wife to conie home. A young man named Conrad was with us. He lives in our house, and we all four went in together. As we were leaving Hope-street Queenby casne up. I had not strack or done anything to Brady. Nothing occurred till we were inside my house. When Queenby came up I said I had got Brady's number and should report him. When we went In Conrad shut the gate and was leaning upon it. Both defendants came up to the gate. I was standing in the passage with my pocketbook in my hand, writing the number of Brady, but before I could do so I was struck a blow on the head with a truncheon. Icannot say which did It, but both rushed into the passage at the same time. Conrad came in bleeding. He had been struck on the head and elbow by Brady, and he ran upstairs. The defendants broke down the gate. (It was produced.) When they rushed in I received several blows on the head, but I could not see, for my eyes were filled with the blood flowing from my head. Somehow I got up and laid hold of Brady's truncheon, when the other defendant struck me six times on the arm. Istruggled with Brady from the passage to the kitchen, and held on to the truncheon so save my life, but was at last compelled to let it go; and Brady then gave me a blow on the top of the head, and I feli down from the effect of it. Both of them then went out into the street. I remained iLside some minutes, and then went out to go to the station 'so complain. I got as far as the corner, but, finding I was covered with blood, I went back to get it wiped. The defendants were then in Old Montague-street, and I told them I should go to the station, when they laid hold of me and said they should lock me up. They did so, and charged me witn haing assaulted them with a poker. I did not do anythirg of the kind. The doctor came and cut the hair from my head where I was hurt. I was detained half an hour, and was then bailed out, I appeared at the police-court to answer their charge, but was so bad that the magistrate ordered me to be taken to the hospital. I was an in-patient till the 23d of July, but was under medical care some time after, and now feel the effect of the blow. Sometimes it Js so bad that I nearly faint. I was tried in this court for assaulting them, but acquitted on the evidence of my wit. nesses. I then charged them. Mrs. Rathgen gave evidence filly bearing out that of h, r husband. As to the cause of the affair she said,-When I returned from taking the girl home I saw Brady at the bottom of Ely-place. He followed us to the top of HopE. street, when he came up behind me and threw my black cloth mantle over my head. I said, "What hav e you done that for e' He said, 5' You know what I did it for-" I said, "I don't understand you, Sir." He said, " I know you, and if you don't go en I'll lock you up." I said, "I have lived in my house over the way eight years, and you cannot lock me ur, for I've done nothing." He said, " You are out soliciting prostitution." I then said in a loud voice, as I got very e>cited at such an insult, " I'll take your number and report you, " and at that moment my husband and Conrad came up and I told them what he had said. My husband took n.e by the arm and told me to go indoors, and said he wou'd report him. Queenby came up and I told him of Brady's conduct. He told me to be off home, and we went home. In three or four minutes they came up to the door. The rest of her evidencoe was withi reference to hbr assault-preoisely the same account as that given by the pro. secutor. Emma Roberts, Mrs. Ratbgen's sister, who was with the when Brady threw up her mantle, and said she was solicit. ing prostitution, entirely corroborated her account of what occurred, and Conrad Wendenheim gave evidence as to the assault upon the prosecutor and himself. Mr. Adams, surgeon at the London Hlospital, stated that he attended to Mr. Rathgen on his admission to that institution, and found that he had a severe laceration of tl:e scalp, which was cut in three or four places. He left on tbe 23d of July, but the wounds were not then healed, and he was an out-patient. The cross-examination of tue wituesses was founded u n the evidence given by the defendants on the former tri3to the effect that Brady, in the first instance, civily asked the parties, who had been drinking and were making a noime in the street at an advanced hour of the morning, to go home; that he was struck by the prosecutor wlth a poker, and that Queenby went to render him that assistance which he was bound to give to a brother officer under such circumstances, when he also was assaulted with the poker, but the facts given in evidence were not in any degree varied although there w ere some miner discrepancies as to certain parts of the transaction. Mr. FsTcALP. addressed the jury at length on behalf cr Brady, who, he said, had served creditably in the police force, in the Sth Hussars, and the Land Transporb Corps n the Crimea, having left the police to join that service, a d was again received into the force. He contended that it wi s clear upon the evidence that there were grounds for tloe constableinterfering-to induce disorderly persons to go home, and that heused his staff only after he had been struck with a poker, as he had solemnly sworn upon his oath, supported by the testimony of the other iefendant Mr. RInTON, on behalf of Queenby, urged that, whatever view the jury might take of the ease as against Brady, it was totally different with respect to his client, who had nothing to do with the original cause of the quarrel, and acted, as he considered, properly in aiding a brother officer whom he believed, and knew, indeed, to have been assaulted, and was assaulted himself. He dwelt with great force upon the circumstance of both defendants having sworn to thtir account of the occurrence, and submitted that they were es much entitled to be beheved as the witnesses now broughIt against them. Qaeenby was entitled to his acquittal if tl e jury thought he acted in the honest belief that he was rendering proper assistance to his fellow-officer. Several sergeants and an inspector of t'ne H division gave each defendant an excellent character as an efricient and well-conducted officer. The regimental sergeant-maj- r of the Land Transport Corps spoke of Brady whUe in the Crimea as a quiet, well-behaved man, Mr. CREASY summed up with great care and minuteness. He said the importance of the case could nob be well exaggerated, and, drawing the distinction between the conduct of Brady and that of Queenby, as deposed to by the witnesses, told the jury that Queezby ought to be acquitted if they realy believed that at the time he was acting under the impression that he was aiding a brother constable who had been illused. The jury retired, and, after some consideration, they came Into court with a verdict of Geuilty against Brady, and Not Guilty with respect to Queenby, whom, nevertheless, they censured for not restraining the violence of his brother constable. Mx. CREASY said he would consult the Assistant-Judge as to what sentenco should be passed upon Brady.

" Iam, Sir, your obedient servaD' "You need not trouble any ono to answer thin"T. ColonG Defendant.t-e admit that I addressed that letter to his Royal Highness. it is my writing. Colonel Foley exmised.-iam a colonel in the Grenadier Guards. The prisoner was a private in the same regiment. He was discharged at his own request. I received the letter produced from his Royal Hlighness the day before yesterday, and I am apprehensive of some violence from the prisoner in con8equence of the tbrea contained therein. Defendant.--hy object in writing that letter was simply to bring my case before the publi. On the 6th of Decemhbr, 1855, while I was on duty in the Crimea, Colonel Foley directed a body of armed men to rob me of a sovereign. I have never since. been able to get any redreae, and I wrote th at letter on purpose to g-t appre.hended. Colonel Foley hes written letters upon this subject to the Secretary-at. War, containing statemnwhlunt mrue. I only require the matter to he investid. Cle Foleowards C olonel Foley h en already submitted to the authoritie and fullyin ed . Mr. JARDINIE.-. aen ob of that. Such matters are generaly inquired into by the proper authorities, and the prisoner should have been content to abide by the decision. As to getting his case before the puble, no advantage would be likely to result to him from tat. As publho opinion is now constituted, it would no doubt agree with t-e conclusons formecd by the tribunal appointed with the puble sanctionto investigatesuchmatters. At car events, I cannot listen to your nonsense about an officer letting on a body of armed when to rob you, and the public are too sensible to believe it either. You have been very foolish anc have got yourself into a serious herape, for you widl have to find sureties to keep the peace. Dnefendant.-I can oferv no sureties except my own. Mr. JARDLNE.-YOU must enter into your own reoogni.- aue in 801., and provide two sureties of 401. each, to keep the peace towards Colonel Foley and all Her Majesty's subjects for twelve months. A voice In the crowd exclaimed, " I' be one l " but the individual who spoke, and who afterwards addressed the Court upon a grievance of . own (begging the reporters o attend to it), was evidently suffering under some mental deluion, and was politely handed out by direction of the magistrate. Thomas Marks Wheeler, resident secretary of a F triend. inNeed Sick wand Life Assurance Societyh" located In Exeter. Change, Upper Wellington-street, was charged with assaulting a married womatn named Lilly. The complainant was in the arcade about w o'clolck on Thursday evening, when the defendant, in a state of intoxication, put his arm round her neck, and, on being reisted, knokeled her down and struck her with considerable -iolence. The defendant said he had been to a wedding, and had drunk too much; the effect being aggravated by the consequence, to his nervous system, of a rullway accident which happened to him some years ago. His worship must name a penalty, and he must pay it. rer. JARiDiE commnitted him to prison for a month. The defendant appeared somewhat startled and dismayed by his worship's necision. MAssYLnxuN.-.George Banister, alias Brooks, was hargeda with burglary and robbery. r.

I hastened towards the spy whence the noise proceeded, amd saw the prisoner sunning off at the top of his speed. Iuran after him, springing my rattle. He threw down a constable who endeavoured to stop him, and ran away again. CBadd, 323 D.-I heard the ry of " Step thfef," and saw prisoner running; I tried to stop him, and wre both fell. Sergeant Edmonds, tiD.-I stopf e the prisoner in Brownsreet, and he then stooped and threw something down a cellar-flap. On the pavement close to the shop I found a brass rodl and some tick-ets. They had boon taken away with the watches from the window. It was further shown that the constable s oden, upon tvrinc on hiseg ight Into the cellar whero the prisoner bad thdrownsomething from him, discovered two of the stolen watches. The six watches were produced, and identifiedby the prose. ecotor as his property. Mr. BROuG, TO N.-Is the prisoner known as having been in custody upon any former ohcasion ?

WEstMaNssR a.-George Clarke, alias Osborne, alias Ashford, alias Cholmondeley, an elderly man of respectable appearance, was finally examined, charged with attempting to obtain money from Mr. John Gurdon Rebow, MP. for Coeboester, by fraud. Horesord said, that meeting the prisoner in Mayfair, and knowing his habits, he determined to watch him, and followed him to Mr. Rebow's. Witness had known the accused for a length of timre, and his real name was Clarke. On the 5th of last December hereceived three months as "Dr. Ashford" for afraudponSiroWalterTrelawny.Onthe7thof last March he was again appreheLaed and committed for three mionths as "IDr. Cholmondeley," for a fraud on Lord Caltborpe andl Mr. Whitbread. Prisoner said distress compeuled him to do it. Mr. ARNOLtd sontenced him to three months' hard labour in the House of Correction, and told him that as his coniviction would be retumed to the sessions, if he were again found offending he would be sent there to receive the punishment awarded to incorrigible rogues. TgeAasxS.-A Peruvian seaman named Augustns Cordell, aged 20, was charged with unlawfuly wounding Jose Pinnor. Committed for trial for unlawfuly wounding the prosecutor. A draught for 201., tho annual donation of the Merchant Taylers! Company for the poor-box fund, was received yesterday by Mr. Selfe. w h e Woatssth indo-,m .-Joseph Woolrombe, describlng himself as a labourer, but reeognied as al well-known thief, was charged with robbery, At about half-past 5 o'clock on the afternooneof the 9th inst. the shopm guan of a jeweller and pawnbroker named Heginbotham, n i the Kiugsland-road, was serving customers at the counter, when he heard a terrible crash at the window, and on running up to it found that a slateglass pane had been completely smashed in by some person outside, and that two gold watchies, one of which had originally cost (10 guineas, three gold chains, andaa gold locket, bad been stolen. The glass had been broken -with a, large piece of pavlagstone, which was found lying inside the window among the other goods, and on hastening out he found a neckchain lying on the pavement, the thief having dropped it in his hurry to escape. The owner of the shop, who had just driven up in his gig, also heard the smash at his window, and caught sight of the back of a man in full flight, andpursued bim but from being encumberedwith a great coat, could notrun fast enough, and helosthim down acourt. Hetherefore hastened back tothe shop to ascertain his loss, and had scarcely got in, when tho prisoner entered, breathless and reeking with perspiration, and offered some trifling article in pledge. He was recognized at once as a well-known thief by the prosecutor, and his excited state producing the conviction that his sudden appearance hlad been made for the purpose of averting suspicion that he had been the perpetrator of the robbery just committed, he was refused to be served, and hurried out of the shop. Information was given to the police, together with a description of the prisoner, who was the next day taken in the ingdland-road, denying all knowledge of the robbery; but the officer who took him finding out that he lived In the court down which the thief had run, took with him also the broken pavingstone with which the gLass had been smashed, and on comparing it with a broken flagstone in the court the pieces were found to exactly fit. This, however, did not fix the prisoner with the offence, and was countervalled by his positive denial of it; but a Mfr. W. Vinall, a plumber and glazier, did so, for ho deposed to seeing the prisoner, whom he could unhesitatingly swear to, standing at the window as he passed it on business, and on returning found him thera stiU-; he then stopped to look at a painting he had a thought of purchasing, and while doing so heard the sudden crash of the glass and saw the rironer's right arm though the hole he had made, but before ecoud seize him he had withdrawn bis arm and taken to his heels, and, though he sharply pursued him, he lost him in the court. The prisoner now said he should be able to prove on another occasion that he was not near the prosecutor's at the time referred to, but Twist, the officer who captured him, said he kniew him to have been charged before with burglary, though he then escaped from want of evidence, and that he should also, he thought, be able to show that be was a ticket-of-leare man; and the depositions were thereupon taken, and the prisoner fully committed for Soit ssW I-FrederlekIlefke, a tall, well*dressed man, 'with sandy hair and mustachios~, and of light complexion, Etated to be a native of Berlin, was brofght up in cnstody of Robert Bell, a detective officer of the X division, charged with having in his posaession a gold watch, chain, and fancy clock, a dressing-case, several articles of jewelry, wearing apparel, and other property of considerable value, supposed to have been stolen or obtained fraudulently from various tradesmen in and about the metropolis. Bell stated tbat on the previous evening, fraim information he received, he went to a house in Elizabeth-street, Dover-road, which was tenmnted by the prisoner, and met him as he was going out. He told him he wanted him on a charge of being concerned with several other foreigners in stealing a large quantit of jewelry, watches, and wearing apparel from several tradesmen in London. He made no answer, and witness took him into custody. On him he found a new gold watch and chain, and a pocket-book containing two passports and several inemorandunss On searching the house he discovered concealed in different parts a dressing-case handsomely fitted up, two ladies companions, a fancy clock, a smal timepiece, a gold looket and chain, a pair of bracelet twovaluabloparasos, several fancy woollen shirts, drawers, 13 towels, 14 silk handkerchiefs, two coats, and other articles, aU of which were quite new, and he believed them to have either been stolen or obtained fraudulently from tradespeople in or about the metropolis. BeU informed his worship that he had no doubt the prisoner belonged to a gang of Prussian swell mobsmen who had been in London about six months carrying on a successful system of plunder among jeweUers and all sorts of tradespeople. They took houEes in respectable nelghbourhoods and kept up a very fashionable appearanco. The wife of the prisoner was examnined at Bow-street on Wednesday for stealing an umbrella from a shop in the Strand, value 30s; and on Tuesday a Prussian woman, who gave the name of Betsy Easton, was charged at this court with stealng a diamond ring worth 12 guineas from the shop of a jeweller in the Railway Arcade. Witness was in possession of such facts about her as left no doubt she was connected with the gang, She resided up to the time of the robbery with the prisoner, and one of the passports in his possession was hers, and her real name was Pohlman, a nativo of Berlin. Witness also believed that he should not only be able to trace more of the gang with the assistance of the Berlin detective police who were in London, but find a vast deal of other valuable property; consequently he asked his worship for a remand. The Magistrate asked whether he had found any owners or the property produced. BeU replied, that he had so recently taken the prisoner into custody that he bad not had sufflcient time to make any inquiries. However, from information he had received from the Prussian police he had no doubt in a few days he should be able to prove an extensive system of plunder, vhich had been going on for some time. The prisoner, as well as his companions,were welliknown as thieves in Berlin, and the Prussian police had traced them to this country. The Magistrate asked the prisoner what he had to say -hy he should not he remanded. *use prisoner (in broken Bnglish) said, it was all false what the ofwicer had stated. He bought the watch and clock in Whsicchapel, the timepiecein Shoreditch, and the other artclelhs were broughtby him from Berlin. The, parasols The Magistrate asked him whether he knew where his Wife was?I He replied that he did not; she was not at home. The Magistrate then told him she was in custody for stealing an umabrela, and remanded at Bow-street, and the other woman whose passport he had was under remand from this court for stealing a diamond ring. He should remand bun until Thursday next. BeL1 found in the possession of the prisoner a large bndUle of pawnbrokers duplicates relative to gold watches, chains, and other articles of jewelry of considerable value, recently pledged.

MIZLTA1Y AND NA VAL INYTEL LIGSIOE. The Argo steamship, Captain Benson, left Portsmouth Harbour for Spithead yesterday morning with SO0 troops on board for India. They were loudly cheered on passing out of harbour; and on reaching Souttheea-beach the North Lincoln Wilitil, who wvere at the time under drill, rushed to the esplanade and gave them a hearty farewell, which was cordiaUy re-echoed by those on hoard. The Sth company of Royal 8appers and Miners, under the command of Captin W. F. Lambert. R.E., 120 officers and men of all ranks, will leave Cbatham this morning aud proceed to Southampton for the purpose of embarking for China to join the other companies of Royal Engineers who have preceded them to that country. The 8th company will be conveyed to Alexandria in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Pera, and proceed overland to Hongkong. The following officers of the Royal Engineers will embark with the 8th company :-Lleutenant J. A. PapUlon, Lieutenant E. H. Coturtney, Lieutenant R. X, F. Sandford, and Lieutenant Shearman Bird. Colonel W. El. Eden, in command of the troops at Chat. ham garrison, has received orders to hold in readiness rein. forcements for the 8th, 29th, 43d (Light Infantry), 70th, 70th, and 84th regimests, who are to embark for India at an early date. A number of officers will oe selected from each of the corps named to embark with the reinforcements. The Argus, 6, paddlewbeel steam sloop, has been docked at Chatham for the purpose of undergoing some extensive repairs, which will necessitate her remaining in dock until February next. The Victor Emmanuel, 91, screw lIne-of-battle-ship, was removed from dock yesterday into the steam basin, Portsmouth, preparatory to trial of her engines. The experiments announced to come off yesterday mornIng in Woolwich-marab, with a view of te3ting the capa. blitles of the 36-inch mortar, designed by Lord Palmerston, were partialy carried out. The frst shot was not fired until noon. The external injuries sustained on the former occasion having been repaired the mortar again presented an appearance of soLdity, and was more firmly secured by extra lashings, and the divisions more firmly bolted. The pecuiar mode in which the barrel is constructed, it being composed of hoops of wrought-Iron 9 incbes broad ar33 inches thick, laid over each other, has been shown in each of the experiments to be extremely defective. On examli nation, after the 6th disoharge, the segment nearest the chamber wherein the charge was contained, was found to be burst asunder. The damage extended to the exterior ring alone. The experiment therefore closed as soon as the accident was discovered. Each charge of powder employed on this occasion consisted of 401b., wbich was contained in eight ba"s of 51b. respectively. It had'been arranged by the seect committee to fire nine rounds In equal charges, without variation or progressive increase, as at the first triaL The bags of powder were alse embedded as formerly in a layer of sawdust, in order to fill in the superfluous space, and thereby counteract the effect of the shock on the metaL The elevatio9>of the weapon was at 42 degrees, and it was stationary, so that the shells were all projected in the same direction ; nevertheless, the range varied at each shot, the average distance being shoutt 1,800 yards, the 'dight over that range occupy ing 17 seconds. A 13-inch shell was likewise fired Immediately before the discharge of the heavy mortar, as a kind of precursor, and to contrast the veloolty and flight of the two aissiles. We are requested to state that the memoir of Sir F. Beaufort, in The Times of yesterday, was extracted from O'Bsrnes Neatal Biography. Lieutenant James El. Ringrose is appointed to the Vulcan. The undermentioned paymasters have retired with the rank of paymasters-in-chief :-Mr. W. Soady, Mr. WV. Bowden, Mr. Thoma W. Parker, Mr. Walter Burke, and Mr. Henry South. THE MILITIA. The Lelcester Militia arrived at Portsmouth yesterday by railway, and embarked on board Her MIajesty's steam troop frigate Vulcan, Commander John Seccombe, for Queenstown.
Mhiss NIOIITIxNaAXE.-An incorrect statement apared some time ago to the effect that Mliss Nightingale arrived in Vienna, and that she intended to examine the arrangements of the Austrian military hospitals. We understand that since her return from the Bast she has not left the country, and we regret to hear that her health still continues much impaired by her exertions on behalf of our sick and wounded soldiers during the late war. THE FALL OF A CHLUYIEY NEAR EOWDEY.-The refusal of the coroner, Mr. R. B. Porter, to allow trte representatives of the press to be preLent at the opening of the inquest on the bodies of the unfortunate men kiUed by the fall of a chimney at the Ouse Chymical Works, Howdendyke, near Howden, on the evening of the 12th inst., preciudes the possibility of affording to the public any authentic report of the proceedings on that occasion; but it Is understood the first day's proceedings were merely of a prellminary and formal character, and that the inquest has been adjourned to Monday next, to allow time for the examination of the scene of the catastrophe by those who are supposed to be quaified to give some explanation of the real cause of the accident. In the meantime it may be mentioned that of the persons wounded on the occasion in Suestion no more are dead than thenumaber alreadyreported. 'he poor fellow Joseph Clough, a plumber, from Bradford, who sustained such severe injuries, is still in a precarious state, and suffbrs severe pains internally. He states that when the crash came he flung himself head foremost into a lead cistern that stood near, but he was arrested in his descent by the fall of the roof of the chamber, and fixed 'with his thighs across the edge of the cistern, where he had to remain crushed and bleeding until he could be extricaLted, which was some time after. Another man named Clough was fastened to the spot on which he wab standing when the accident occurzed by the fall of a beam, but his head, arms, and upper part of his body were left free. The other survivors are also suffering severely, and nono of them can at present be pronounced out of danger. A local paper gives the following additional particulars as to the plce and manner of the acoidenti :--"About six months sInce a large tannery on the river side was taken by Mr. George Anderton, jun., of Cleckheaton, near Bradford, and converted into a chymical manufactory. At the same time he commenced enlarging it by erecting on the other side vitrHol workshops. The buildings were very extensive, and consisted of large vitriol chambers and a chimney, the effect of the fall of 'which we have been recording, The vitriol ehamber, erected on substantial brick pillars, vas 150 feet long, 27 feet deep, and about the same in 'width, being peraps the largest of the kind in the kingdom. It was very strongly built, being formed of a framework of planks completely lined with lead. At the north end of this chamber stood the second one, close by which was the chimney. The latter was circular, and was 126 feet high, 13 feet in diameter at the base, and 8 feet at the top, Including the coping. From some fault or other-whether the foundation had given way, or the builders were blunderers, we cannot say - there was a deflection from the perpendicular of more than two feet. The chimney had been some time since completed. On Saturday night the plumbers were putting the last hand to the lead work in the vitriol chamber. They were working over-time to have all in readiness for the opening of the works in the early part of this week. How. ever, before commencing operations, Mr. Anderton thought it prdent to have the opinion of a scientific gentleman of manchester, Mr. Wild as to the chimney. This he did early last week. Mr. tWild, we understand, gave it as his opinion that no dauger was to be apprehended-undertook the rectification of the chimney, and actually had a man employed at it for the purpose on Friday and Satur. day. It is said by some that he had partly sue. ceaded in his object; others deny it, At any rate, up to the time of the accident, Mr. Wild seemed to have no idea of danger. We are even told, on good authority, that Mr. Anderton told hinm so late as Saturday that if there was the least danger to be apprehended to undermine the chimney and throw it into a neighbouring field. Mr. Wild was perfectly confident as to its safety, and this seemed to be the general optnion. There is, of eourse, plenty of prophesying after the event, and we have met with one or two who ' knew it was going to happen, and saw it this long time.' The proprietor and his friends, and the contractors, however, did not seem to suspect anything of the kind, as It is scarcely a fortnight since the completion of the work was formaUy celebrated by them by a public dinner in Howden. Some idea may be formed of the extent of the crash when we state that the vitriol chamber was swept off tho parapet from end to end, as if it had been a building of cards. The massive planks were shattered and riven as though they were rush-work in the hands of a hild. The chimney tumbled almost to its very foundation, c3rry. ing with it three of the walls of the nitro chamber, which were 40 feet high. The escape of a sinle one of the workmen, who were all employed in the vitriol chamber, from such a catastrophe is perfectly astonishing. On Tuesday four of the pereons kiled wee interred at Howden. Great sympathy is manifested in the neighbourhood both with the sufferers and their friends, and the much esteemed proprietor of the 'works, Mr. Gecrge Anderton, jan. The pecuniary loss will not, we trust, be quite so large as at first stated." MVRDER OF A YOUNG WotAN-.-On Wednesday evening a young woman named Maria Blackmoor, who had been employed as a servant at the Valley of Recks Hotel, Lynton, North Devon, was murdered by John Barwick, a sort of jobbing labourer in the town, who has for some months past paid his addresses to the deceased. Oa Wednesday she sent a messenger to him to requesthim to come and see her at her mother's residence. He went and remained in conversation with the young woman for more than a quarter of an hour. What was the subject is not known, but immediately afterwards she rushed Into the room 'where her mother was covered with blood, and, falling upon the floor, died instantly. It appeared that Barwick struck the poor girl in the neck 'with his cLaspsnife, 'which he had sharpened the saame morn. Ing, completely severing the arteries. After giving the death-blow, Barvick appears to ha ve returned to his home directly, on reaching which he said "I have done it,"I upon 'which his sister said, "tDone'what 1" Barwick rejoined, "Done for Maria;" at the same time brandishing his claspknife, with blood upon it, adding, "and if you don't mind I will do for you also." Of course so alarm had in the meantime been given. A surgeon was called in, and pronounced the poor girl beyond aU surgical aid, and in less than an hour Barwick was in custody, charged with the murder. A coroner's inquest was to be held yesterday. TEB GREAT SLANDER TRiAL AT DUBLLY.-The cam for the plaintiff closed yesterday, and Mr. Lynch, Q. C, opened for the defence. One witness was produced, whose direct examination ocoupied the rest of the day. After whioh the Court adjourned to this mornin, when the trIil wil be resumed. There is hardly a proba'ility of theflna.c this week. Monday or Tuesday, probbly, the Chief Baron Wi el>yvr big glb,rge to the jury.
THE .VEIV INDIAN RH Y. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sir,-I trust that the day of disaster is passed; it behovesusnowto rebuild. In forming another native army it seems to me that the objects to be principaLy kept in view are the following:- 1. To take care that the native element does not again obtain too overwhelming a disproportion over the foreigntroops. 2. Int every poBsible way to divide the native troops, and guard against any chance of their union for any purposes of their own. 3. To render the native army one which shall add to the general strength of the empire, and be efficient for general service whenever required, in or out of India. 4. To make the native army xulficiently cheap to admit of the incrnased expenses of European forces in an empire already financially cramped. 5. To take care that the army is efficiently officered. 0. To make the army an agent of our civilization and religion and a nueleus of the partisans of our rule. I do not attempt to speculate on the materials of an increased European force, or on the question whether negroes or others, not Asiatics, may be enlisted for Indian service. Suffice it that we must have a greatly increased European, or, at any rate, non-Asiatic force constantly ia the country; say, the 40,000 European soldiers whom we have hitherto 'cad, or ought to have had, must be increased to 70,000 or 80,000. On the other hand, I think that the tendency of the events of the rebellion, so far as it has yet gone, is to show that, provided we are secure of the army. when the immediate effects of the revolt have blown over, and due measures of precaution, disarmament, &c., are taken, we may safely hold the country with a force numerically smaHer than that which we have hitherto maintained; so far at least as internal government, the suzerainft over native States, and our immediate external borders are concerned. I think it is pretty clear that if instead of fighting us on their own soil the Sepoys had gone over to the Emperor of China, we might have maintained our civil government even with the smll number of Europeans we now have-certainly with the proposed increased European force-the native princes who have territories to lose having been almost universaDy faithful, the Affghan frontier Intact, and civil rebellion nowhere rising in the first few months beyond what it would have been in the power of a small detachment to suppress. I assume, then, that, external dangers apart, the reduction of the army is possible, and seeing the actual absence of external danger, and that improved quality will go far to moke up for inferior quantity, I have no doubt that we shall and must conform to what Is, in fact, a financial necessity, and shall manage to get on with a reduced army. Say we add 30,000 or 40,000 to our Europeans, we may, no doubt, reduce 80,000 or 100,000 natives, thus doubly adding to our internal security by adding to our chief safeguard, and taking from what must, under all circumstances, be our chief danger. For many duties native troops are necessary, and for financial reasons, also, a large portion of our army must still be native. To fulfil, then, the objects which I propose, we must study- To get men as free as possible from the bigotry of caste and qucsi-religion, which has now broken into such a frenzy, and also, as far as may be, free from political or national bigotries; To enlist in our service as many different and, as far as may be, antagonistic races as possible; To maintain, as far as conveniently may be, local divisions of the army and divisions of system-that is, maintaining several different kinds of forces with as little as possible in common in the way of pay, regulations, &c. Of course, all our soldiers must be men of a material brave and stanch enough to make, with suftlcient drill, really good fighting men. First, then, let us see who are the men most available and best fitted for our purpose. To begln with those who have best served us in our necessity, there are the Sikhs, so lately our foes, and now forming so large a proportion of that local Punjab army which alone of all our native armies throughout India has shown no sign of mutiny. The Sikl-s are brave; they are fine, powerful men; they are remarkably free from prejudice and caste, and ready to go anywhere ; in their habits and tastes they seem to amalgamate with us, and, judging from present experience, they must have taken verv kindly to our rule. They are also sufflciently numerous to supply very large levies, and yet the proper Sikh country is not so very extensive as in any degree to be comparable to great Hindostan, wbich has now given so wide a field to the rebellion of a single race. Undoubtedly, the Sikhs are a very fine material, and they are quite appreciated. They are now the most conspicuous of our friends, and, being the nearest and most obvious and accessible, there is in all this part of the country a great disposition to enlist Sikhs for every duty. The only fear is that it might possibly be carried too far, for, with all their advantages, it must still be remem-bered that they have very recent reminiscences of political power, and the nilitary domination of Prietorian bands, and wonderfully as they have stuck to us during this greatest of all possible temptations, moral and political impulses are not to be fathomed, and it is yet possible that they might one day turn against us. I think, then, that we may well enlist a very large force of Sikhs, but that we must neither give them too great a preponderance nor mass them too much together. The Siklhs are very well adapted for foreign service. That they have no objection to embark they have already shown, and their domestic habits are convenient. They neither maintain families in jealous seclusion like Mahomedans or Rajpoots, nor do they drag about whole camps of wives and familics like some of the native troops. In that respect they are more like Europeans. In each company will often be found a few women who seem to cook for the whole party, and make themselves generally useful, and are altogether very useful additions. And they all mness together with a very light and simple cooking establishment, and are not too particular about endless lavations; in fact, altogether are capital fellows to rough it, and travel very light. In their homes they are quite an agricultural race, by no means predatory, and they submit well to discipline, while they have enough of casual drunkenness and disorder to give discipline saome hold over them. It has been well remarked of the old Sepoys that they were in quarters and in their ordinary duties so well behaved that it was impossible to lick them into shape by discipline. It was all a level surface, but we had no hold on them. Such combination and steady unanimity of mutiny would have been impossible among any other race of soldiers. The Mahormedans of the Punjab Cis-Indus are of Indian-not Affghan race and habits-a quiet orderly set. They seem to make good soldiers, and are less prejudiced and bigoted than their brethren of Hindostan, and less hostile to us; probably because they had been so long the subject race under the Sikhs that they look on us in some degree rather as deliverers than as conquerors. We may well employ a proportion of them. And this brings me to the Trans-Indus Ilahomedans-the men of Affghan race-who next to the Sikhs (and in no very inferior degree) are the staple of the Punjab forces. These men are chiefly enlisted from the tribes on our frontier, the Eusufzyes, &o., part of whom are our turbulent subjects, and part our predatory enemies. In their own country and homes these men have indoubtedly much national and political bigotry, but nevertheless they seem to make excellent mercenary soldiers. They are exceedingly fine men; with discipline, exceedingly brave. They have nothing whatever in commaon withh Eindostanees,-even with those claining a common descent. They speak a different language (Pushtoo), are totally free from all the prejudices of caste, &c., of the fndian Mahomedans, eat with Europeans as readily as Turks, and have no sympathy whatever with Indians of any kind,-in fact, despise them heartily. Their religion does not seem to sit very heavily on them, except when combined with a cry of national independence. They are wretchedly poor in their own country, and have for ages been accustomed to serve as mercenaries through a great part of Asia. They are also, it may be mentioned, the hereditary enemies of the Sikbs. Here, then, is, undoubtedly, a very fine material for our purposes, provided, of course, we bear in mi34dthat H India ever is invaded it wll probably bre from the Affghan side, and with the aid of Afghan auxiliaries, and therefore we must not carry too far a preference for that race. Nest come the Ohoorkas and hillmen. The pure Q.o9rkas iare, beyond all doubts the best native Boldiert ir, the field we have ever hd ; witness the deedv. of Reid's Regiment before Delhi (which is, hovwever, the only hill regiment which has done mach) By all'means let us employ as many of these men as we can, even though Nepaul be the only independent State in India. But the real Ghoorkas are exceedingly scarce ; they are hardly to be had, and the hillmen, who have been amalgamated with them, though In many respects better, and less prejudiced than the plaius people, are nothing like the real Ghoorkas. Besides, they hate the plains, and suffer much in health there, and the Ghoorka regiments are very troublesome about their families, the whole of which they carry about with them from cantonment to cantonment, and are always leaving companies to look after them, and so on, aa the hill women are much prized and not remarkably virtuous, and seem to give their lords andmasters a gooddeal of anxiety. Ihopethal the G;hoorka regiments may be much increased, but they must always be limited both in numbers and in the duties they will perform. They certainly will not live constantly in the plains, and I1 don't know whether they would go abroad or not. The Punjab hillmen, the Dogras, are understood to be capable of making good soldiers. They are the clansmen of Gholab Singh. Throughout Central India is an aboriginal race, or races, variously known as Bheels, Gonda or Ehonds, &c., and in no degree flindoo in race, religion, or language. The two or three Bheel corps already in existence seem to have remained faithful to us and done good service. If so, probably we mlght largely recruit our army from this race in many different quarters. A different and more agricultural race are the lately rebellious Santhals, evidently possessed of abundant animal courage. I should think that in Bengal some regiments of Santhals might be raised with great advantage. I don't know much of the tribes of the eastern frontier of Bengal and Assam, but perhaps they may supply soldiers. do not know enough of the Madras and Bombay Presidencies to be able to judge what new blood may be there best enlisted, but whatever there is will probably be required to supply the requisite alloy in the native armies of those Presidencies. In Bombay the principles of intermixture and real discipline seem to have been already acted on much more than elsewhere, and the partial mutinies which have occurred seem to be the result of the too large admissions of the now demented lindostanee element. It will be necessary to put a stop to the insane love of show which has, I am told, led some Bombay commanding officers to enlist principally from Iindostan, with the contemptible object of getting larger and finer looking men than their brethren in arms-men who appear better on parade. But I do not know that it would be desirable altogether to exclude the Ifindostanees, who are sufficiently free from prejudice and amenable to discipline to serve well in the foreign Bombay army. If kept within due limits such an element may be possibly little dangerous, and might be useful in case of disturbance among the southern races. At any rate, the Rindostanees who have shown a mutinous spirit eliminated, the Bombay aWrmy is probably sO far good that its improvement mnay be left to those who know it better. Though the Madras army has as yet even less than that of Bombay partaken in the present mutiny, and its discipline is I believe, in many respects better than that of i3engal, still, writing subject to correction, I suspect that the whole mass of that army is a great deal too UIiform in its composition, too mauch one material throughout; and we have reason to know that it is imbued with some dangerous caste prejudices. It may therefore be liable to a universal mutiny such as we have experienced. Certainly, the number of regular and regularly officered native infantryregiments of Madras is disproportionately large. They may probably be -with advantage redtuced and alloyed. There are many Christians in Southern India-cannot they be enlistedi and made good soldiers ? There are also aboriginal tribes In the hilly country who may probably serve us. And, above all, I would at once take over from the Nizam his foreign mercenaries, and make them our own-a measure by which I should imagine that we should at the same time greatly strengthen his internal Government (whiclh is principally disturbed by these men), weaken him as a source of political apprehension, and strengthen ourselves. I would get rid of the Hindostanees of the present contingent, and take on these men instead, leaving the Nizain to employ the indigenous element to a moderate extentas local and civil corps for his own purpose. Turbulent as the foreigners now are, they would probably under us, with regular pay and regular strict discipline, make admirable troops, ready to cut the throats of any number of natives whenever requlred; while I fancy that their numbers are not sufficient to render them dangerous to the empire when enlisted for general service. I do not know if the Nizam has many real Affghans in his servlce. If so, they are probably the most turbulent of the turbulent. Yet we knov by experience that they can be made good soldiers, and if we can tame an Affghan we can probably tame any one else whoever. The southern colony of Sikhs I would take over bodily, and probably they may with advantage be kept separate from the other Sikhs. The Arabs would probably manke mercenary soldiers as good as the Ghoorkas. The Rohillas are, I fancy, our old friends the IIindostanee Mahomedans, and wre should not care to entertain them. Thus, then, Southern India may probably be supplied. But still, to replace the great Bengal Army, with all the affiliated contingents, legions, &c., which have all gone with it-in fact, almost twothirds of the whole Indian army-to garrison Hindostan, Bengal, and the Punjab, when we have completed the enlistment to the prudent or practicable extent of Sikhs, Affghana, Ghoorkas, Bheels, and Santhals I suspect that we shall still be shorthanded. To fill up completely from these sources would involve too great a preponderance of the Punjabee element-the Ghoorkas being limited, the Bheels and Santhals probably the same, and also probably physically unequal to Ptnjabees, Antagonistic as are the two great Punjab elements, what might happen if the Punjab were in the hands of some enemy ? Or, serving together, might they not unite to some more common military interest? I should hardly like the great mass of the native army, from Peshawur to Calcutta, supplied from the Punjab alone. But the alien races of India beiag exhausted, where are we to look to supply the deficiency ? It strikes me that among the seaboard countries of Asia and the Asian Isles some more fit for our purpose might be found. What kind of people are Sir J. Brooke@s friends, the Dyaks ? Perhaps something might be made of them. Can we catch any Oriental negroes? Are there not Shangs, or some such people inland, from the Tenasserim provinces, who might take service morereadily than the Burmese seem inclined to dos? Certainly, Malaya might be enlisted. And are the Christian Cingalese fit for soldiers? I would certainly strain^ every nerve to get some regiments of such race quite alien to the findoos, but fit to garrison Bengal and parts of India of a climate not dissimilar to their own. However, the proposition Is to some extent a speculation, and we must come at last to ae question, iiShail we any longer trust arms in the hands of any of the Eindostan race?" Unles we can import an army of Dyaks I believe that, to some extent, we must do so. And after all, despite the terrible severity of the lesson which we have learnt, we must bear in mind that the catastrophe has resulted not so much from the admission of a Hindostanee element into our military service as from isanelY givlng a practical monopoly of thaat srvice to one particular native class throughout the greater portion of our Indian dominions. Largely as the Punjab was garrisoned with a great Hindostanee army, stil there being also a tolerably strong European force, and a small local array of native Punjabees, the mutiny was in that country by the energy of a Lawrence completely and triumphantly suppressed. This frenzy will hardly be the normal state of Hindostanees. They have served us for a hundred years before a relaxed discipline has ended in this grand outbreak; they may serve us for an- other hundred years before they have again the wiU, and they wil then no longer have the power so to break out again. We must bear in mind that ia some qualities they are unrivaled-no troops are so easily kept in order, and certainly in none is there so remarkable an individual fidelity. Who ever heard of an individual Sepoy betraying his trust? They have for a hundred years guarded our treasure, our property, and our persons, and till now hardly in one instance has au individual played false. In al such duties they are generally theleast troublesome, best, and cheapest soldiers in the world. Before they were spoilt by over indulgence and iadiscriminate prai4e they wore alsoj I believe, by no mo2 svi , temptible in the field. And, widely separated as they are in feeling and interests from the Punjabees and other Indian races, they might be useful if any of the latter should be seized with any fury of rebellion. The Punjab will now be the only province in India which is intrusted exclusively (the Europeans excepted) to the natives of the province, and a little lindostauee element might not have a bad effect on an emergency. Still there is no doubt that the prejudices of the greater portion of the military Bindostanees go far to unfit them for our regular armies. And now we have learnt that under that quiet garb they possess a power of union, of all things most to be dreaded in an army, and are on that account alone most dangerous troops, I should say that we must limit their employment as much as possible; but stUll I believe that we shal find it indispensable to employ some of the natives of Hindostan, and that by properly selecting those classes which are least likely to prove false to us the greater portion, even of the diminished danger, may be averted-in fact, that wfe may find Hindostanees more to be trusted than those we have hitherto had, and may entertain them in less dangerous number. I think that much may be done and that great advantages will result in many ways from raising in our military service the inferior classes of the Rindoo community. I believe there can be no doubt that the lowest class of all-the impure men-denied all plac-e in the Hindoo religion, are well fitted for soldiers. They are probably a mongrel race formed from the debris of all the other classes. Physically they are in no degree in,erlor to any, and they have often fought well, and are very generally employed as watchmen, &c. In the Punjab this class is very numerous, and the Sikh religion has fully recognized their claim to Admission into the ranks of the people and to much improved positions. Many of them are regular Sikhs, and in the military employ of Sikh chiefs have been most remarkable for unscrupulous and desperate daring. I would, both in Hindostan and in the Punjab, largely enlist men of this class. It would be. In the present state of feeling among Hlindostaneec, necessary to keep them separate, and it would be desirable to insist on their abstinence from degradingpractices-for instance,fram eating carrion, &c. They might probably be wnth advantage colIlected together in colonies, and might be converted !to Christianity. j A much more numerous class throughout Hindostan are the Chumars-not a proscribed class, but the lowest in the Hlindoo scale. They are the most common hired labourers and Coolies, and much entertained in many kinds of service-tent-pitchers, grooms (they have the care of nine-tenths of our horses), magazine-men, &c. These men are to be had in any numbers. Their name is one of contempt among well born Eindostanees, and they have never been admitted into the army, except as artillery drivers, where they serve verv well. As they have never been much tried, doubts may be entertained as to whether they are brave enough for soldiers. But certainly asgrooms to the vicious Indian horses and as camp followers they show no want of courage, and, low as their position is, humble and unsoldierlike as most of them appear, it very well may be that the best of such men would make a very good material for the soldiers of a regular army. I imagine that the Russian serfs who make the Autocrat's soldiers are often in occupation and poaition quite as low. Many of the Ohumars in the more respectable situations are already smart enough looking men. It is, at any rate, well worth the experiment to try whether they are fitted for 1soldiers, and I would certainly enlist some and try them. Besides the low caste men there are throughout Iindoatan a very great variety of agricultural and d ther tribes who have very little caste prejudice, and I ave shown themselves friendly to us; the Jats, for instance, than whom none make finer soldiers. Men If the various local tribes and classes should be sought out and enlisted, and altogether I would have it that whatever limited Hindostanee force we retain it should be entirely on the Bombay system, that there should be no monopoly of high caste, no excessive yielding to prejudice, no laxness of discipline ; but that all who entered our service should |give earnest of their devotion by submitting to all that can be required to inake thorough soldiers. IThe number of the old regiments whose conduct entitles them to be retained is almost nil-certainly not more than four or five-and they must submit to sufficient discipline. For the rest we must then, to hold our districts in their present disorganized Etate, enlist a moderate number of low caste and other Hindostanees. Inallthesearrangements much wil, of coure, be experiment, but we shall for a little time be in greater want of soldiers of some kind than will hereafter be the case, and we may then disband those who do not well succeed. Meantime any man whom we can get in arms on our side will have an effect on the population. I next come to the means by which the native troops may be best divided, and union rendered impossible. The Isolation of the Madras and Bombay local armies has been of such benefit in this crisis that we certainly should not break down that line. But I do not see my way to any complete division of the grand army. We shall certainly want the Punjabees to form a large proportion of the garrison of Hindostan, and any regular regiments of Hindostanees may with great advantage be kept in the Punjab. Bengal may be for the most part held by local troops, but the Sikhs and others must pass down that way for foreign service. Altogether, then, I think that we must replaee the Bengal army and its dependencies by a general imperial army, for service throughout the empire, and to be cantoned throughout India, the Madras and Bombay special provinces excepted. In distributing this army we should, no doubt, to a great extent, follow the Austrian practice of keeping the different regiments a great deal in countries foreign to them. lf the Bombay army gets through this crisis successfully, its limits might perhaps be somewhat extended up into Rajpootana. The military force required in the Bengal proper districts is so very small that in addition to the troops quartered at the Presidency, I should think it not Limprobable that they might be held by a few local corps of Santhals, &c., and imported Dyaks; and so we should avoid the introduction of Hindostanees altogether, and it would not be neceasary to keep the Punjab troops so far from their homes, and in a climnate so very hostile to them. If a sufficient force of Dyaks, &c., be not available, it strikes me that it might be a good plan to make Barrackpore and Calcutta a permanent itation of the Madras army, which would alone supply all the native troops required for service there. They would in that case be in no degree broug ht intO contact with the Bengal native army, a depdt for the emubarcation and disembarcation of regiments of the latter force proceeding beyond feas being kept apart somewhere on the other side of the river. And tne advantage would be that while,isolated as they would be in a strange country, with nothing im common with the people or the soldiers, we could always depend on the fidelity of these Madras men as against any Bengal insurreetion, they might on an emergency at once occupy the most important Bengal stations, their place being in a few days, with the aid of steam, supplied from the Madras coast. Similarly it would, I think, be a good check on the Madras and Bombay armies to make it a rule that the towns and eantonments of Madras and Bombay should be exelusively (so far as native troops are conerned) garrisoned by regiments of the grand army, who would thus come into no contact with the native troops, but would form a foreign and reliable nucleus in case of local mutiny. Thus, then, in each of the different divisions of India, in Hindostam, Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, we should, independently of the increased European forces, be much more secure in our native forces than we have ever been; and in Bengal we should truist to popularity, Europeans, a few Hindostanees, and to the division between Sikhs and Affghans. The system of contingents under European offieers in native States has utterly failed. The contingents composed of the same material as the regular army have one and all joined the mutineers, and our only assistance has been from the proper troops of native chiefs in their own management-not very efficient troops, it is true, but most useful in many ways in this crisis, while their masters have amply shown that they too well appreciate what they have to lose to ran the risk of rebellion and anarchy. Even under any improved form, then, I still think it will be undesirable to renew the contingents. It will be better to compromise the matter by taking the contingent payments (now generally provided for by assignments of territory) towards the cost of the Earopean and regular army maintained for the eommon defence, while in exchange we gratify the chief by allowing him to manage his own military .!aW )4iWdlf, I would Aonly liWit tl =MI1W of his guns and maintain some political supervision, It would be a good plan to prohibit the cating of guns altogether throughout India (since heavy artillery has always been our only difficulty with native forces), and to rule that all Princes shall be supplied wsith these Instruments by us at.a fair price in proportion to their proper necessities. We should thus be little apprehensive of danger from any of the native States now left, while the troops of the Princes would be-ulke the contingentsforces totally distinct from, and having nothing ia commion with, our army, whose services we coald call in when required by domestic troubles. Thus the feudatory Powers would, in fact, supply another division of the native troops in India. This suggesta another division in the distinction between generalservice and localcorps, and the question whether we shall maintain separate local police battalions to do most of the civil and detached duty hitherto for the most performed either by the regular army or by very etty aillorganzed loc guard This would certainly supply a division in point of system, rules, pay, tc., which might be beneficial and would be attended with other advantages. While the Punjab local force has almost saved India, it is true that the Oade force has joined the rebels, and that, In the present instance, our position might have been httle better if we had had local Bindostanee corps throughout Hindostan. Though such corps would not have led in the total overthrow of Government, they would probably have followed the rebellion. But, to begin with, the chances are much against such anotherfor the time triumphantly successful Hindostanee mutiny. Forewarned we are forearmed, and we cannot believe that again so vast a body of troops of any single, and especially of the H:indostanee class, will again overthrow the Govern- I ment. Till that occur local troops will probably remain faithful. In any combination in any purely military question they will probably stand aloof, and Lltogether they will be less prone to mutiny than regular troops. But more than this, if they ever do mutiny they would have infitely less power of combination. Enlisted locally in each district and according to the varying opinions of individual officers, every corps would differ essentially in its composition from the next. They would never meetwonld know nothing of one another-and between a local corDs in the Benares division and one in the Delhi divlsion there would be very little In common, and certainly no communication. Supposing that the whole native regular army struck on a question of pay we could probably with such police corps maintain the civil Govermnent while the Europeans and regular natives fought oiit the matter between them. I think the local corps would await theresult. There are also other important objects to be gained by this arrangement, and to some degree it seems to me to be indispensable. There are very many duties, such as the guarding of gaols, which are not advantageously intrusted to regular soldiers, and I believe that nothing is so destructive to discipline as the detachment of small parties on such duties. The local corps would be cheaper, would perform such duties quite as well, and would form a nucleus around which to driLl and discipline the civil establishments. They would thus give the army a very great expansibility, and would be well able to take charge of cantonments, &c., and to maintain the peace of the country, if the whole regular army were withdrawn to meet any external foe. It might probably be arranged that their ranks might be at any time extended by the addition of a large portion of the civiL establishments already subjected to a kind of a militia drill. Upon the whole then I would certainly have a proportion of these local corps. Limited in numbers, but capable of expansion, I would make them, in Hindostan at least, as localas possible, and, while they wouli want many of the qualities of a regular army, would try to obtain, in the control over their hearths and families, the security of their property and relations, &C., a local hold on their fidelity. In many districts a sort of nucleus and small body guard might perhaps be formed of foreigners. In districts near the hills hillmen may perhaps be obtained. In the upper districts of Hindostan we might probably with great advantage employ a class of Cis-Sutlej Siklhs, the descendants of the old protected clans who have not been much enlisted in the regular army. Lower down, Bheels or Santals may be available. For the rest, even in flindostan, as we must employ some Elindostanees, perhaps this local service wil be the best way of doing so. Their prejudices against foreign service will not be touched, they will be easily kept in order, and suffer less from the detachnment and laxness of discipline than any other troops. Eachmagistrate will select the classes and individuals most likely to be faithful, and he will have much local hold on them. On these principles, then, I would have police corps in each division to perform all the civil duties. f1 should remark that the local corps which joined the rebellioL were not fair samples of what local corps might be under a good system. The Hurrianah Light Infantry were partly Sepoys of the old class and partly men of the particularly predatory tribes of the Delhi district, who were the first to join the rebelion; and the Oude locals were Sepoys of Sepoys-men of the Sepoy class of the heart of the Sepoy country. In almost any other districts local corps would have been far lees likely to join, and In future the class of men would be greatly changed. There is a measure which I would particularly suggest as attended with many advantages, and a means of getting over an important difficulty. The increased demand for European soldiers in India will greatly try the recruiting resources of England. Why, then, should there not be some interchange ? 'Why should not the place of regiments soon to be sent to India be in some mneasure supplied by native Indian regiments. I believe that they might very well and efficiently do this duty-that Ceylon, the Mauritius, the Cape, and other colonies might be largely garrisoned from India, and that the Indian army might be made a great resource in case of Imperial war. Provided they have their occasional tour of duty near their homes, the Sikhs, &c., have no objection to foreign service; and nothing would tend so much to open their minds, to make India appreciate the real empire of England, and to indoctrinate them with our ideas and civilization. In the regular army I would enlist every man for general service throughout the world, and a proportion of the army would always be kept on foreign duty, the remainder, while in India, receiviug a fair share of leave to their homes. Thus a Sikh regiment would be one day at Agra, another at the Cape, and a third back at Lahore. It would, I think, be an excellent plan to enlist a largeproportlon of thearmyin the capacity of Sappers and Miners, and so to employ them. There wiU now be very much to do in the way of fortifications and miitary rearrangements of all kinds. The class of men whom we now desire to enlist will be those fitted for spade work, and we may make them as wueful as the Emperor of Russia does his regiments of serfs. Wherever there is a sufficient number of Europeans, Christians, or other classes in whom we can sufficiently confide a militia system may with great advantage be maintained. The necessities of the crisis have already given rise to much organization of this kind. The objects of sufficiently economizing in our native army and efficiently officering it may, I believe, be taken together. We shall not get cheaper soldiers than the old Sepoys, conscriptions and lowY pay have not yet been tried in India, but about half of the expense of the native army has hitherto consisted in the European officers. I am no advocate for increasng the number of those officers. The old system has proved a complete failare, as is avowed on all hands. I beiieve that we absolutely cannot by any possible means afford to add to the number of European offlicers of native troops, that all our money must go to pay for European soldiers, and I think that the minor details of internal discipline, such as belongs to the officers of companles, may be well performed by selected (not promoted in rotation) native officers; that they much better understand and have more influence over their men, and might be much more useful in case of difficulty or disaffection. It is only when actually in the field that European officers are most useful to lead. My plan, tnen, is as follows;European troops must require the constant eye of their officers when in quarters, and in India especially a large body of officers must be attached to them. In the field of battle they require comparatively little leading. They are always ready to go forward. The native troops, on the contrary, do not usually require many European officers in time of peace,-only in the field of battle they are necessary. I would, then, reduce to three selected men the European officers of native regiments; but on occasion of particular regiments being sent on very arduous service, in which pitched battles are to be expected, r would detach from Eurooean regiments a caTWa ,unMnr 9f 9ffiers, and Atvnh t00M toe- porarily a fighting offioers to the native crps, not to interfere with their discipline, but simply to lea I the companies in the field. Thus would a great par' of the expense of the army be saved with litte lost. of efficiency. Something will be gained by the reduction of the. native army to make up for the increased expensae of Europeans; but the contingent and indirecz expenses of the latter are enormous, the barracks. and commissariat aud other charges are endless and unless we adopt some such eoonomy in the officera an. that which Ihave propowed weshl certainlbe baukrupt. Already the army consumes a far greater proportion of the expenses of the State than in anyother country in the world, and it is eertain thatmoney can be saved in no other department. The enlistment of friendly raco and classes, the, elevation of the oppressed castes, their attachment to us, and it may be conversion to our religion,. foreign service, and a thoroughly European systena of discipllne,-all these will do much to civilize and attach to our cause the native army, and througk them much of the native population. For the rest we may attempt schemes of military colonization an t the dishribution of pensioners and partisans, but this Iavolves many matters of civil governaent, and E shall not here trench on them. I am, Sir, your most obedient servanus A SOIDJXL Cawnpore, Oct. 26.
2HE MUTINY AT KOTAH. ---- ---s "TO THE: EDITOR OF THE TIME. Sir,-The fearful state of grief and distress into whlchk my mother, sister, two brothers, ad rnysalf have beeu. plunged entirely unfits me for the task of drawing up a accoant fit for publication In your paper, and I therefore. earneety entreatyou, in justice to the memory'ofmylamrted father, kindly to read the shocking account which I wilt write below, and, if you think proper, to publish It wlit such au article as your better judgment may dictate. I tmst entirely to your kindness and benevolenae to show to the world how little my beloved father and brother deserved. such a bitter fate. Pray excuse the trouble I am giving you, but, as I wadcl before, I ready bave not the power to place such circum_ stances in their proper light. Trusting you wil not refuse my request, I remain, Sir, yours truly, n - Neenauch, Nov. 6. _ ,, . uoLVN " Major Charles Burton, political agent of Kotah, and his two youngest sons, fine, brave, spirit boys, between the ages of 19 and 21, have met with a tragical fate at Rotahb having been attacked suddenly, withorut one mnoment's wara-. ing, by a couple of regiments of the Maharajah, cavalry and infantry, who revolted, and, dividing Into several parties, surrounded the agency-house almost in a few moments. Tile politicalagent was himself the first to discover their ap. proach, and, as he had only returned to Kotah three da previously from an abhence of four months, he beUeved the numnber of people he saw advancing merely to be some of the chief subordinates coming to pay hil the usual visit of ceremony and respect. In a second he was cruelly nunde. celved; the mutineers rashed into the house, the servants, both private and public, abandoned him with only one exception (a camel driver), and the agent, his boys, and this one solitary servant fled to the top of the house for safety, snatching up such few arms as were within their reach, the fiends pursuing; but the cowardly rulaians were drivenback for the time by the youngest boy shooting one in the thigh. When there they naturaUy hopd the agency servants or their own would have returned with assistance from the chief; bht no-all fled, and no help came. In the meantine, the rjutineers proceeded to loot the house, snd they saw from their position all their property carried away. A little while and two gnus were brought to play upon the bungalow, the upper part of which caught fire from the lighted stoks which the miscreants from time to time threw up. Balls feU around them, the little room at the top fell in, and they were yet unhurt-and this for five long sud weary hours. Major Bnrton wished to parley with the miutineers, in the hope they would be contented if he gave himself up, and allow his boys to eeca;e- but hia chlldred would not aow of sach a sacrifice for their sakes, and, like brave men and good Christians, they all knelt down and uttered their last prayers to that God who will surely avenge their cause. All now seemed compazatively quiet, and they began to hope the danger over, and let; aown tbe one servant who was still with them on a miujion to the Sikh soldiers and others, wko were placed by the chief for the personal protection of the agent rotnd his bungalow, and of whom at the time there were not less than 140, to beg of them to loosen the boat, that an escape might be attempted across the river. They said, 'W e have Ead ro orders.' At this moment a shot from a pistol was fired. Scaling ladders had been obtained, the murderers ascende& tho walls, and the father and his sons were at one fell stroke destroyed. sThere is every reason to believe that many, if notall, of the agency establishment were welU aware tha' an attack was to be made. It is to be hoped that no worse feeling than that of cowardly fear kept their tongues tied. Assistance might have been sent from the chief. A gun fired from the city walls woRld have dispersed the whole cowardly mob, but it is said tbat he also was forcibly kept in hits palace by the people of the city, who stood in fear of their own lives and property. It is also said that the magazine had fallen into the hands of tho mutineers, and that othors in the city were revolting; but no authentic intelligence has as yet reached the authorities here on that head. The Maharajah was cnabled to reoover the bodies of the agent and both his sons in tho evening, and they were carefully buried by his order. Dr. Salder's house was attacked at the same time with the agencyhouse. He was cut down outside, in sight of the agent, as was also Mr. Saviell, the doctor of the dispensary in the city, and one or two others whose names are not certain. " No cause whatever can be asdgned for this outrageMajor Burton ws beloved by every one, by the chief especially. He had lived there 13 years, and led alife of peace and usefulness. No dispute, no quarrel had ever existed between himself or any of the nartives, and he had hastened his return by some 10 days at the chief's own request, as he wished to see not only himself, but all his family back again Major Burton's absence was caused in the first place by his presence being required with the Kotah troops at Neemuch by the officer commandlng at that station, and when In July the services of the Kotah soldiery were dlspensed with, the agent remained for the two months' usual leave granted to him during the bad weather months at iNeemuch, and he left that station on the 7th of October, arrived at Kotah on the 13th, was received by the chief writh every kindness, paid and returned the usual ceremonious visit, found all quiet and apparently peaceful and happy, and was cruelly murdered on the loth of October, 1857.

METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORis.-The ordinary meeting of the Board was hdld yeaterday at Guildhall, Mr. J. Thwajtes in the chair. The financial statement presented to the meeting exhibited a total general balance of 130,8. Os. 6d. The chairman reported that he had, pursuant to the resolution of the Board, received from the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works, &c., the Exchequerbills, amounting to 89,100l., and cash amounting to 7351. 4s., applicable to the Southwark improvement. A report was presented from the Fhiance Committee respecting the alleged liability of the city of London to contribxute towards thezom of 140,0001. raised for carrying out main drain ge rates The report stated that the oommittee, having dul considered the matter, recommended that the sam oa 19,174!. 6s. 7d., a portion of the loan of 140,0001. for main drainage effected by the Metropolitan Commissioners ot Sewers, Including interest, and the sum of 16,7441. 7s Ud., a, portion oftbeassetsin credit onthe sameloan,nowapportione to the city of London and other parts not heretofore included in districts rated by thosc commlssioners, be apportioneo among the several parts of the metropolis liable thereto and that the resolutions of the Board of the 3d of March last in relat'on to those matters be, for thopurposes of the present assessment, varled accordingly. The committee. then suggest that the Board should forthwith proceed to ascertain and assess certain sums uponi the city of London, and several other parts liable thereto, for tefraying the expenses of the Board in the execution of the Act for the. better Local Management of the Metropolis for the year 1857. Mr, Rows moved as an amendment, that. the question of the liability of the city of London. to the payment of a portion of the said sara of O 140,0 . be submitted to counsel for their opinion. After a disoxission and two division, the amendment wan carried. Mr. Carpmael asked if any answer had been re, celved to the applhcation made to Government for complete plans of the works recommended in the report of the referee, engineers as to the main drainage of the metropolis. Mr. Woolryh, the clerk, said that no answer had been recolveic to the last two applications made by this board. Mr. Carnmael said he thought the hoard had been most unfairi treated by the head of the Department of Works, &o. Sir Benjamin Hallhad attributed to them thecause of the delay, whereas the fact was, they had not boen furnished with proper materials to judge of the merits of the plan of the. referees. Mr. Bristow gavo notice that on an early day he. should call the attention of the Board to a statement made by the First Commi3sioner of Works in the House of Commons on Friday week, He wished to ask if there was anylikelihood of the report of Messrs. Hawksley and Bidderbeing speedily laid before the Board. Mr.Woolrych thoughtthere was no probability at present. The Board thenx. adjoured.
