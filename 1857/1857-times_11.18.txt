The LORD MAiYOu said,-Gentlemen, in taking the chair for the firsttime I begto assure yon that I feel the full responsibilty of the high office to which I have been elected. Iam satisfied that during my year of offioe, not only my brethren who have passed the chair, but also those -who are below it, will at all times give me that kind assistance and earnest support which they have hitherto so generously and considerately accorded to provious Lord Mayors. (Hear, hear.) I assure yon that I shall invariably seek your advice and counsel in all matters relating to the business and the interests of this great corporation. It will be my stedfast. aim and object to uphold the dignity of the Court, and to protect the rights, the privileges, and the interests of the corporation. As tinie is precious to us all, and as it Is well to eeonomize it as much as possible, I shall feel it my duty to observe striit punctuality, which I am convinced will tend materially to the efficienc and regularity of the proceedings of the Court. (Cheers.) Tr LATE LogD MrAYOR. Sir P. LAURrE, the Senior Alderman, sald,-My Lord Mayor, the pleasing duty devolves upon me of pro a vote of thanks to the late Lord Mayor, Mr. Adean Finnis. I am quite sure that my brethren will agree with me when I say that no man who ever filled the distinguished office of Lord Myor more faithfully, and zealously discharged his duty than my friend Alder. man Finnis. (Cheers.) He began his mayoralty by visiting not only the prisons under the jurisdiction of the corporation, but he lost no opportunity of visitin work. houses, refuges for the destitute, =s dasylums for the juvenile distressed, with a view to the alleviation of their distress. These are matters which in my humble judgment entitle him to the warmest thanks of this Court, and I trust that all who follow him will follow the example he has set them. (Hear, hear.) On the arrival of Dr. Livingston in this country he lest no time in inviting the great discoverer to the Mansion-house, and set on foot a subscription of which I trust this country will reap the benefis. The news of the Indian mutiny had hardly reached this country 12 hours before the late Lord Mayor called a meeting for the purpose of raising afund for the relief of the suffierers, and boy his energwy and perseverance he has been the means of .ollecting an enormous sum of money, which is now being udiciously employedi in temporarily assisting the victims of a diabolicallconspiracy inIndia.

THB WOUNDED ENGINEERS AT DBLI. TO THEY EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-In the absence of official medical debails, the follow. ing may set at ease some anxious hearts. It is from a wounded officer of Engineers:- " All the wounded of our corps vre doing well, except Salkeld, who is still in a precarious state." This was written on the 224 of September. Nov. 16. Your obedient servant,
TO THE.EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir.-My attention having been called to a report which appeared in 27e Times and other newspapers, to the effect that the son of EIis Majesty the King of Onde has flad from Lucknow, I beg leave to state, upon authority, that the King of Oade has had only three legitimate sons borne to him by his present Queen. The eldest of these, being an Idiot, is confiled to the Zenana ,t Luoknow; the second died of smallpox when only 12 years of age; and the third Is his Royal Highness the heir apparent, at present In this country. The rumour in question can therefore, if true, only refer to an iUegitimate son of the King, a youth who Is notr more than 10 or U -years of age, and whom the mutineers have probably seized with the view of farthering their owa purposes. I have the honour to remain, Sir, MA.Uli accredited Agent to His Majesty the K1g6of 0 ade. 13, 'Warwick-road, Maida-hill West, Paddington, Nov. 16.
The TOTOPE and CLOCKat WR3STMINSTER. An able cont3'aental work once remarked that Englishmen generally knew less of the new Houses of Pa-cliament, which excite the admiration of all Europe, than they did of almostany other work on which 50,0001. of their publicmoney bad been expended. The charge, beyond a doubt, is true. Pinnacle after pinnacle and tower after tower of this suburb of palaces has slowly grown up and been finished without attracting any more public attention than is devoted to the construction of a new drain, or the repealing a church-rate. Daily a stream of people pass by works of the very existence of which thOy are unaware, though the engineers and architects from America and France, and indeed from all parts of the civilized world, come thousands of miles to inspect them at Westminstor. Which of our readers knows that the Victoria Tower is the standard of its kind for atclitectural beauty and engineering skill and that it is the raost elaborate and lofty tower that has ever been raised Eince the time of the confusion of tongues? Tho other day a perky little estimate dragged its great compeer-the Clock Tower-into a temporary notoriety, by saying how much had been expended in gilding its superb gothic lantern; but sincs that notice it has relapsed into obscurity again, and the public think of it no more. Yet this tower is amply worth a visit of inspection, both for itself and the purpose with which it has been built, It is almost more than 20 years since its foundations were laid, so it has grown up at the slowly progressing rate of about 17 feet a-year, for it is now from foundation to summit 326 feet high. As with the foundations under ail other portions of the now Houses no bearing plies were used. The space marked for the foundation was first entirely enclosed with a double row of thc strongest oak piles driven deep into the earth and this was filled in with metallic concrete to the depth of 12 feet, and on this the masonry was begun at 14 feet below the surface, making the depth of the foundation 26 feet in all. The strength of the foundation may be judged from the fact that, in spite of the enormous weight which the Clock Tower piles upon its superficial surface, no sobsi. deuce of any part of the structure, even to the most minute degree, has yet been perceived. The Clock-tower, as its namo imports, has been mainly built for the purpose of sUpporting the great clock and its monster chime of bells, and since the machinery for me.- suring time was first Invented no clock.case so magnificent and elaborate has yet been conceived. Yet it is intended to be applied to other purposes besides merely keep. ing the great timekeeper. Its whole height is divlded into nine stoties, exclusive of the clock-room, bell-chamber, and lantern. Each of these floors is subdivided into at least four, and sometimes many more apartments, which run parallel with each of tho four faces of the tower. Ihe inside of the tower (within these rooms) Is 28 feet square, and is occupied first by an air shaft, 8 feet wide, for venti. lating the whole of the now Houses, and which rises to the very top; and secondly by the clock shaft, a smill inner tower of brickwork. This latter is theshaft on which the great clock Will stand, and down which its weights will descend. It Is 160 feet high, 11 feet long, by 8 feet 6 inches wide, and 20 inches thick. This shaft is the only spaca large enough to admit of " B;g Ben" ever getting to the top of the tower at all, and even he must go up sideways (greatly increasing the diffliculty of the operation), as he is 9t fe4t in diameter by 7 feet 10 inches high. The lower floors of the tower will be used as ordinary offices. The two upper floors Will be used as prison rooms, not for State criminals, but only for refractory UI.P.'s and such fraU borough brokers as in their unguarded dealings -with the "free and independent" may inctu the displeasure of the faithful Comamons. The other apartments Will be usod as depositories, where the fature records of both Houses will slumber in dust till disturbed by the next historian anxious to know the exact origin of the Income tax or the precise date down to which bishops sat and voted in the House of Lords. Access to the upper parts of the tower is gained by the unual spiral staircase, which in this instance is of a most unusual length. For the first 100 steps or so the way is lit with gas and the air is close and heavy. With the next 100 you emerge into the dim daylight, which now and then one of the 68 windows which adorn the tower throws across the staircase. A hundred steps more andthe way is dark again, and you instinctively feel you havo attained a great height, and walk with nervous caution, or look shudderingly over the rails down the weU stairs, which seem to end In a faint bluish light, dimly seen far far beneath. Another effort, treading heavily and sorely out of breath, for you havo cilmbed 330 steps in all, and you are in the clock-room. It is a lofty dark- chamber, 28 feet by 19, and some 25 high. A forge and anvil occupies one part of it at present, where the wrought-iron plates to be used in the fittings aro being welded together. About 12 feot above the floor, in oach of the four walls, is a massive bar of iron, with a small nuolous of maohinery attached to each, which passes through the dial rooms beyond and turns the hands of the clock outside the tower. In the centre of the room is a yawning black aperture, the clc].k shaft, which goes down a sheer depth of 160 feet, and seoms to make a person giddy even to be in the room with it. On the walls of this shafb the great clock is to stand, and do wn it its going and striking weights wiiU hang. It is necess cry to approach the history of this great timepiece with considerable caution, for never since tirme first began has such a bone of contention been cast among the professors of horology. On account of its various phases of interest, ani its having given rise to no less than four collections of official correspondence published in Parliamentary papers, as well as cabals, intrigues, and petitions innumerable, a long account of its origin, rise, and progress is given in the last edition of the En ckclcpdia BriUannim. From this it appears that the history of the great timeplece now extends over a period of nearly 14 years. The conditions which the Boare of Works, acting on the advice of the Astronomer sloyal, required to be fulfiled in the manu. facture of the clock were then considered so difficult as to be almost unattainable by any clockmaker. Three competitors among the great clock manmufacturrs nevertheless entered the fSeld-Vulliamy, Whitehurst, and Dent, though the first protested against the fourth condition of the Board of Works, that *' the striking of the first blow of the hour was to be acuorate to a second of time." The estimate of Mr. Dent was less than half the amount which either of the other rmakers demanded, and, as his was the only plan which satisfied the Astronomer Royal and which undertook to fulfil all the conditions of the Board of Works, it was in 1847 tacitly accepted during one of the brief lucid intervals of that branch of the Administration. But from this date tiU 1851 nothing further was done at all, when fortanately Mr. E. B. Denison, Q.C., whose horologica3 skiU and knowledge is perhaps greater than any other man's whether ini or out of the trade, was called in and associated with Mr. Airy, and to these two gentlemen the design for the clock was intrusted. YMr. Dent was of course the person employed to make it, and no sooner was that fact definitely known than the company of clockmakers rose in a body to oppose, and in 1852 sent ia a mnemorial to the Board of Works on the unfitness of the Astronomer Royal or the Chairman of the Horological Jury of the Exhibition to superintend or design the clock, and o' Mr. Dent to make it. This denunciation, coupled with Invidious remarks contrasting the folly of our Government employing Mr. Dent with the wisdom of the Emperor of China and the Corporation of London, both of whom had ordered clocks from an old firm in Clerkenwell, had a great effect on the then Chief Commissioner, so much so that when the next batch of Parliamentary clock papers was published in 1855 it appesaed that the Board had occupied the two previous years in putting the public to the expense of paying for five legal opinions from the Attorney and Solicitor General, and from one of the present judges, to see if they could not get rid of Mr. Dent's contract and Mr. Denison's superintendence altogether. The decisions, however, were adverse, when, after further and more bitter disagreements, the " Board" refused to correspond with both Mr. Denison and Mr. Dent, aind the result was tha' either theshaftof the Clock Towerwas built too -mall forth clock and bells, or the clock and bells were made too large for the tower shaft, as they certainly would not go up it without alterations in the deAlgns-and in the works also At last, however, Sir B. Hall came to the Board of Works, and then, it seems, all went well ;-the bell and chimes were cast, the clock was finished and set to work, and but for the recent unaccountable accident to " Big Ben" the whole apparatus might have been put up and in full operation before next Christmas. The clock, which has been made entirely after the design of Mr. Denison, has now been going two years. in Mr. Dent's factory. Its entire mechanism is so simple and novel that it looks like anything but what it really is. The spectator would much more readily believe it to be an elaborate windlass or a double-action mangle than the largest, strongest, most carefully finished, and accurate clock that has probably ever yet been made since time began. The space it occupies in its frame It 15 feet long by 4 feet 7 inches wide, and Its total weight between 6 and 7 tons. It is.intended to be set in the mai6nry.in the top of the clock-shaft we have mentioned, and down which its pendulum and striking and going weightawiihang. It is uncertain what the latter maybe, but it is evident, when we come to regard the ponderous weight of. the hammers required to strike the hours and quarters, that the former at least must be exceedingly heavy-probably five or six tons. ThA clock Is fitted with Mr. Denison's gravity escapement, and, by a peculiar arrangement of ratchot wheels, the winding, no matter how long it lasts, does not stop or alter the clock for one single instant. The pendulum is entirely detached from the rest of tleo clock and fixtd intu the wall of the tower. It is a compon. sated two-seconds pendulum swinging about 2 degrees from zero, or 14 inches in all. It is 14 feet long, weighing ever 6 cwt., and more than double the size of the Post-ifiloeclock pcndulura, which 'was the largest in the world. It a made of a hollow perforated iron tube about 4inehoh diameter, enclosing a drawn zino tube 10 feet 6 inches long and half an inch thick. Alterations of less than foar seoonds in the time arc made by means of two loose weights of 61b. each, one of which is always kept on the collarof the-pendulu2n, and taking this off for a quarter of an hour zetards the clock a second; putting the other loose weight; on accelerates it a second. The permanent alterations are done with smaller weights. An ounce laid on the collar accelerates the rate a second &-day and vice versd. If the whole apparatus of this great clock was made io be wound by hand it would require four or five hours'oon. tinuous winding each day, and even then be such hard labour as would be too much almost for convicts, since the handle would have to be turned some 4,000 and 5,000 tiaesa and weights of mbny tons drawn up to a height of 156 feet. Many plans were proposed to get over this difficulty---no to Use wind and some to employ water-all possible, but most expensive and difficult. Mr. Deniwon at last modified the plans of lIr. James, the enginemaker, into a scheme by which the clock will be wound by water, though still keeping up the means of winding by hand whenever neceMary. By this plan each striking weight, instead of going quite to the ground, descends on the top of a piston moving in a short cylinder, at the bottom of which, by means of the clock mechanism, a elide valve is opened and lets in water from a tank about 200 feet above it. This drives up the piston and weight more than tho height required for striking twelve (three feet) when the piston itself gradually turns off the water and sink., and the weight is left hanging ready to strike as if wound by hand. This will be repeated each hour (it the whole appa. ratus does not get frozen up in winter), and the going parts of the clock (made for 81 days) are wound by hand each week, when the man will receive the correct time per telegraph from Greenwich, and so regulate the clock if ever necessary. The latter, however, is not very likely, for, though it has now been going two years at Dent's, Its deviations have not yet amounted to two seconds either way. Such, thon, is the clock chamber and the clock that I to occupy it soon. Ieving it by a door in the corner we pas i at once into a long narrow passage. The wa on the right i brick, and formas a side of the clock chamber we hzve ju*tquitted. That on the left is opaque glas, and the flood of light which it admits, broken only by gilt tracery and large Gothic numerals, tell us in a second that we are in one of the great clock dials on which the progress of the machinery within will be recorded to all London from hour tohour. It looks frorm the inside like one of the huge round windows which here and there adorn our earlier cathedrls, and which, like them, is intersected In all directona with the most elaborate tracery and lattioework. The framework of the dials with their subdivision into quarter hours and minutes Is made of cast-iron. Every dial frame was esiin six segments by Mr. James, and each one weighs four tons, and is no less than 22feet 6 inches In diameter. The space between each minute is 1 foot 2 inches, and the figures are upwards of 2 feet high, and nearly 6 feet apart. The numerals are beautifully made, and will be much adv mired, in spite of a noble peer's complaint to the House offl Lords that iu consequence of their being Gothic in form becould not tell the time by them. The minute handis 16 feet long, and, notwitbstandingthatitis made ofcopperandbeaterL out as thin asis consistent with its length and strength5, is still weighs 2 cat. The first hands made (and there ig a raro coUection of them of all shapes andaizes at the bottom of the tower) were of cast-iron, and weighed 4 cwt. Ths hour hand is nine feet long, and is fastened with the minuta hand to the centre of the dial by a huge gilt rose (pat o' the arms of Westminster), which is about the size of a small dining table. All the interstices between th3 figures and work on the clock face are glazed ina:Vith enameled glass, so as to present the appearance of a white dial in the day and allow it to be iUlminated during the night. Each dial will be lit with 60 gas jets, which will ba turnedaon and off by a peculiar adaptation of the clock work. The light in the dial will thus wane as day dawns and increase with the fading twilight. The cost of the ga for this wil be 500!. per annum. The single dial clock a, Mechlln is larger than these dials, but for a four-diallei clock there is none with such large faces in the world. St. Paul's Clock has only two 17 feet dials, aud is womiu every day, and next to this the largest clock in the kdngdom is that of Shandon Church, at Cork, which has four dlals, each 16 feet in diameter. Leaving the dial-rooms we again ascend that never-endin,, staircase, till at last it terminates in the bright sunlight,more than 200 feet above the streets, amid light handsome arch3s with the outside Gothic work of hammered iron all ricblr gilded. This is the bell chamber, where the iron tongues of the great clock below are to dwell for ever. The mechanism by which Big Bcn and his chiming satellites will be suspended is simple, yet beautifaUy adapted to its purpose. A kind of massive octagon collar of wrought iron boiler plate goes round the chamber about 14 feet from the floor and 2 feet from the side walls. This is supported by 12 cast iron standards, which, resting on the masonry of the Walls, lean out at a slight inclination, and meet the collar. Pads of vulcanized indiarubber cut off all vibration paswing from the collar to the standards, while rollers at the base of the standards themselves provide for the contraction and expansion of the metal, Wrought-iron tie-rods prevent any chbance of lateral thrust upon the walls. This whole apparatus only weighs some 14 tons, yet it is no exaggeration to say that It Is almost strong enough to bear the whole tower. The actual weight of the five beWs it will support, with their hammers, is upwards of 30 tons. Big Ben, when heIs recast, will hang in the centre of the collar, and weigh 16 tons. His thnndering note is E naturaL The first great quarter boll will hang in one corner of the collar. It is 6 feet diameter, 41 tons weight (nearly a ton heavier than the bell of St. PAul's), and its note is B. The second is 4 feet 7 inches in diameter, 2 tons weight, and ite note E. The third is 3 feet 11 inches diameter, 14 tons weight, with a note F; and the fourth, 3 feet 7 inches dismeter, 23 owt. in weight, with a note G. Our musica readers may therefore judge at onceoof the harmony and beauty of the chimes, for they are intended to run thus:For the quarter hour, G F E B; half-hour, E G F B, E F G E; three quarters, G E F B, B F G E, G F B B; at thehour, E G B B, E F G B, G B F B, B F G E. The hammer and lever which strike Big Ben together weigh one ton; the others will be struck with hammers in proportion to their weights and sizes. So much for the bell-chamber and its hard, gloomy inmates. They are to be fixed in their places and can neve: ring a joyful peal, but only mark the passage of the floeting hours, or be tolled slowly for some great calamity which shall bow our heads in mourning. From the bell-chauinb3r the works go higher still, but the stairs cease, and the lofty points beyond are only to be gained by mounting ladders which are tied from one perilous scaffold ng t) another. Slowly the visitor climbs, with cold, trembling hands, creeping from ladder to ladder, catching through Gothic openings now and tbhn a dizzy glimpse of roofs and tops of lofty buildings, with themighty city, half hidden in its smoke, spread like a map far down beneath him. A stage or network of pon. derous -beams, all bound and clamped together with iron, Is Foon gained. This Is the scaffolding from which the bells will be hoisted up and hung in the chamber beneath. The beam for Big Ben is here. It is a huge uncouth pieoe oE wrought iron two tons in weight, wrhich has bee.a tesed. with 70 tons' strain, and only deflected one-fifth of an inch. Here also is the " crab" by which the tongue of London, Big Ben, wlll itself be hoisted up by eight men in 12 hours. The chain to haul him is 1,500 feet long, and has been tested to 10 tons, which, doubled as it will be seven times, makes it equal tea strain of qite 100 tons. The four quarter bells will he hoisted up hero in the course of another week. A short ladder leads from this place to the Iintern gallery, wnen you seem suddenly to enterfairy land, andare dazzled with the sheen of gold and colour around. You are now high over the clock and beneath the pointed roof. The work which from below seems such light tracery and net- work of golden lines is suddenly transformed to beams, shields, and fl5ing arches so massive in themselves as almost to form another tower,so thickly gilded that they trulF seem as if wrought fronm the precious mctaL The brilliancyof the work loWs and flashes from a thousand points at oncefrom th e great rows of shields overhead, bright with the arms of England and W'estminster, from the elaborate cornices, the gable windows, the vanes, the scroll work hand-rail-the very battlements and stone-work itEelf are rich with heavy gilding. The stone frame in which the clock is set and al thechiefupperontlines of the tower are diilarly adorned, Eo that the effect is beautiful beyond description, and thbe eye, almost pained by is brilliancy, seeks relief in ga2ing on the sober masses of the great groups of towers and palaces belowv. Higher than this lantern gallery the visitor cannot go, though the pointed fdof is still 100 feet above him, and light and gracefal as it appears from the ground, yet it nevertheless actually contains 400 tons of iron. The descent of the tower. as of another celebrated place. is essy enough, and one soon gets down the ladders, the s¢affolding, the bell-chamber, the clock-room, and that long, long staircase to the bottom. Once again upon the ground the great clock tower seems more lofty and magaiflcsnt than evr. It is merely one ornamental accessory of a great plan, but if it stood alone it would still be a grand monumnet of our taste and skill.

MONEY-MdARKETand CITY INTBLLIGENG.E. Tuesday Evening. 7he quotation of gold at Paris is about 9 per inile premium, and the short exchange on London is 25-35 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mfint price of 31. 17s. lAId. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is about 2-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advicas from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange onl London is 13'54 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English bunt price is therefore nearly 5-l1thts per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg. The quotation of the exchange at New York on London for biUs at 60 days' sight is about 108 per cent. for first-class paper, and 103 to 101 for other descriptions. The present rate of discouant here will therefore prevent any profit oni the trans- aisasion of gold from this country. TLe English funds opened this morning at the lower prices of last evening, but the market was -subsequently firm, and after regular hours a decided improvement took place on a report that the Bank Df France are about to extend their circulation, either by an immediate issue of the contemplated DfO. (21.) notes, or in some other manner. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 89 to i, and the last official price was 80J to g. Ultimately bargains were entered into at 89i to k for money, and 90 for the 7th of December. The rate for loans on Government securities throughout the day ranged between 8 and 10 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 214; Reduced, 88# to fi; New Three per Cents., 88k to j ; India Stock, 211 to 214; India Bonds, 50s. to 40s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 18s. to 13s. discount. The demand for discount at the Bank continueH on ant extraordinary scale, and the infringement of the Act of 1844 is believed to have been already carried to a rather wide extent. The transactions in foreign stocks have been limited, and no important change has taken place. Turkish closed slightly flatter. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, were negotiated a' 96i; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Mexican, 18 and 18k; lor the account, 17k; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 7v4 and 75; Spanish, for the account, 40k and i ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 241 atnd ; Turkish Six per Cents., 88; for the account, 87T and R; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 96i and 97. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of impottance from the rates of last post. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was GGf. 65c. both for money and account, showing an improvement of more than an eighth. About 120,000 sovereigns were returnod to-day from Scotland, but a total of 220,000 was sent to Ireland and elsewhere. The Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Banking. Company closed its doors this morniLig. It was a bank of issue with an authorized circulation of 35,3781., and its general liabilities are supposed to range between 400,0001. and 500,0001. It had a nominal capital of 500,0001., of which 100,0001. is paid uip, and according to its last return 7,0001. had been appropriated to a reserve fund. The number of shareholders is about 200, and the principal losses will fall, it is presumed, on persons connected with the iron trade. The mercantile house of Messrs. Hoare, Buxton, and Co., in the Swedish trade, have notified that they are compelled to suspend for the general protection of their creditors. They believe their estate to be solvent, and that, unless anything now unforeseen occurs, none of the parties interested will sustain loss. Their liabilities are understood to be considerable. The firm of Hoare, Miller, and Co., connected with Manchester and Calcutta, of -vhich some of the partners are members, is in no way compromised by this event. The suspension was also announced of Messrs. Edwards and Matthie, a firm largely engageil in the prodace-markets, as East Indian and colonial brokers. Neasrs. Fitch and Skeet, who snspended in the provision trade on the I1th inst., with liabilities for 55,0001., have intimated that, instead of an extension of two, four, and six montbs, they will require only one, two, and three months. It has been arranged for a meeting of Messrs. Denalstoun's creditors to take place at the London Tavern on the 26th inst., when the accountanats, Mr. Coleman, of London, and Messrs. l?err, Anderson, and Co., of Glawgow, will be prepared with a gem ral statement. A maeeting of crediters of Mlessrs. Clayton and :M'I;everingan, ship builders, was held yesterday at Live rpool, and a composition was accepted of 7s. in The poun7d. The liabilities were stated at 22,0001. A)out 4,0001. of Russian gola was taken to the Bank; to-day. The Ottoman Bank have received about 20,0001. in g.Id from the East, of which 1,0001. arrived yes, ei day and the rernainder to-day. TIe 206,0001. of Australian gold brought by the Avon was delivered in London to-day. About 72 (;OI. has been sold for the continent, and the balance is expected to be taken to the Bank tomorrow. The Mexican dollars brought by La Plata at the beginning of the month have been disposed of to-day at 59gd., being a decline of 0d. from the price realized for those by the packet of Jast month. A passenger by the Emeu steamer, from Melbourne forlondon, nvid Marseilles, states that not only the Marseilles portion of the mail was taken by the Admiralty agent in the boat, when the Emeu got on shore, but also those marked South. ampton. This refers only to the letters; the newspapers were kept on board the Emeu. The Ausls-nlasians with the passengers, gold, and newspapers, may be expected at Southampton on the 20th, and probably the missing letters will arrive by the next Indian mail, due about the 30th inst., and which will be telegraphed perhaps on the 27th. According to the Journal de Fran1kfort a company has been founded at Twer, to be caled the Commernial Company of the North, for the purpose of eat. Llishing a flotilla of merchant steamers and the general development of Russian industry and commei ce. The capital is to be 25,000,000 silver roubles (4,200,0001.), and operations are to be commenlced when 100,000 hares of 250 roubles are talkenl up.

Sir,-Referrina to your remarks in regard to the news taken out by the Atlantic being probably anticipated by the Africa or the Vanderbilt, I beg to state that for more than a month ppst every steamner leaving Eugland for Amorica has taken out news packages to be landed, if possible, at Calpe Race, and thence telegraphed to all parts of the United States, and I have reason to anticipate that special efforts wili be made to forward the Atlantic's sdvices through this chanDeL The Associated Press of Noew Yurkbave stationed a 3scbt off Cape Race for the exprcss purpose of interceptir8 the European steamers; henco there is very little ground for supposing that the advices from this aide on Saturday last will anticipate those taken out by the Atlautic.

The annexed is from the United Mexican Mining Asesociation " Extracts of Despatch from the Commissioners, dated Guanaxuato, October 14:- "arrZ OF JEnSUS MARIA Y JOSE. "The state of this mine Is most satisfactory as to its present yield, and most encouraging in its appearances for the future. The deepening of the shaft continues in favourable rock, and is fast progressing, and, notwithstanding that such an operation might have been expected materially to interrupt and lessen the extraction, this bas been for the two weeks since our last report 2,200 cargas, being 1,200 cargas the last week, and 1,000 oargas the previous week. The ley has rather improved than deteriorated. Mth works carrying on are the shaft (which has ]ready bfen deepened 13 varas), the new Boca lIlne, whilh hbas wched a depth of 42 varais, the poro of *ommmnclation, the frentes of San Pedro and San Pablo, thsfl of San Alejo and San Martin, and the pozo of Dolores. Of the pozo of communication between the upper and the owo works, uaeiu a oAd In tho mlne, an nesary for ventilation, it is most satisfactory to observe that it is goiDg down in the voin, in ore, and that this oreis widening 1.eilrg now 2 varas in width; whereas at our last report it did not exceed : vara. On tbe 1st inst. 815 cargas wore s Id for $3,819, and we shall sell again to-morrow. The q.pazterly division of profits with the owners to the 3Soh tilt. sbowed a surplus over expenditure of $13,818. h iag a profit of more than $1,000 a-week. Of this $13.818, $4,606 were appropriated towards the extioction of the debt, $, 141 as actual (i.e. present) profit to the assooation, and the remainder, $3,070. to the:owner', the result of which follows that the actual receipts of the company vwere $10,747 83c. I have reason to expect the next quarterly receipts will be greater, and present circumStances justify us in the hope that we may at no distant period make a renmittance to London, which would be a source of as great satisfaction to the commissioner as it could possibly be to the shareholders, and I may add, they will alone be restrained by a due sense and considerationfor the existence and future well-being of the association." The following relates to the Pernambuco Railway :- 1 "London, Nov. 14. " Slr,-Having been informed that a report wes ciroualingthatone of the concesslonnaires, who is a directoroof the PIernambuco Railway Company, bad disposed of aU his shares, and that such report had a depressing Influence on the company's stock, I am induced to trespass on you with this letter. So far is the above from being correct that my brother and myself (the concessionnaires) conjointly hold a stake in the enterprise in company's shares more than 33 times greater than by the rules of the company a single director is required to hol4 in the company's stock. I have lately learnt the report originated in the chairman at the last general meeting having said, in reply to an inquiry, that one of the concessionnaires had sold out his Interest in the concern. I presume the chairman made the proper answer; but, as a statement of the facts will give quite a contrary iwpression to the one that at preseot obtains, in justice to the proprietors of stock and to olr. selves I vernture to hope you will give room to the following explanation:- In the book of transfers of the company {here exists a single transfer of all of one of the concessionnaires shars into the name of the other concessionnaire-the stamp used is a 30S. one, and tuje consideration Os. Had one of the concessionnaires sold out he would evidentlyhave made a bad bargain, and defrauded the revenue, The smid transfer shows that ib was effected soon after the formation of the company,-in fact, on my brother leaving for Brazil on business connected witlh the company, to enable me to co4duct his affairs in this country. A simple statement of whc b appeared on one page of the transfer-book would have pre--nted the necessity of this letter-vix., that at an early date of the compaAy's existence one concessionnasie had transferred all his shares to the other, and if it could have bsen added that the presumption was that it was no sale, because of the nature of the stamp and the value of the consideration, it would, I think, heve been still better. ' It is scarcely necessary for me to say that I do not attn. bute any intention to the chairman-indeed, he has assured me he made the statement on she spur of the moment. "I will only add,- for I do not want to lead the shareholders as=tay eithor way,-that both my brother and myself feel ourselves at perfect liberty to sell our shares, and that we intend to do so whenever the manner in which the business of the company is conducted is at variance with what we th-nk conducive to its interests. In doing so we should merely follow the law of self-preservation; we might, however, very possibly be wrong, for concess7onnaires are naturally liable to exaggerate the evils of any other management than that wvhich, in their great interest in their own offapring, they have concluded to be the only proper one.

STATfi.6OP TBADE. MANCHESTER, Nov. 17. TLe letters from India have brought, as they always do, souie orders in both yarn and cloth. and there has been a little businesa in cloth, both for Bombay and Calcutta, at the lowest current prices of last week. In other kinds of cloth there have been some transactions where sellers have bt en willing to accept low prices, and in a general way it has fallen to the share of those whose necessitiesare greatest, and who have consequently been the easiest to deal with. The business in yarn for India includes most counts of mule, the competition among spinners for such business as was to 'be had inducing them to take lower prices than last week. Generally speaking, spinners have been free sellers, and in some cases they have talken a reduction of id. to ad. per lb. The advance in the cotton-market at Liverpool appears to have had no effect upon the Manchester market to-day, and the prices of all kinds of goods are fully as low as last week, w here, indeed, tbey are not lowsr. Some little more business is spoken of in cloths for South A merica, where p rices have suited the books of the buyer. Jn yarns for the home trade, for Germany, and other m arkets, sellers report no business. Messrs. Slagg and Co. teporb " Prozmi Tzeslay to Frlday last there was little or no buslue3s done in gooda but in the attempts to Eell priew rapidly declined, and we Pgeiu make a conaiderable reduotion lu our quotatlons. Snte Ydday, however-tat more efpedally yesterday and to-day-a tirmer and moze oheerful feeling has prevailed throughout the market generauy; and owlng to the accounts receivea from Iudia and Ohinm, a ftir amout of biusem has been done for thoee markets, but so fsa sellers havonotbeen able to reaiBzeasy amyvao3 on tbe very low pricea of lust week." LEEDS, Nov. 17. There is a slight improvement in the woollen trade, a better feeling being manifest in the cloth-halls this morning, and a larger amount of business being done than at the last two or three Tuesday's markets. A few moderate purchases of cloths of a general character were made in the coloured cloth-hall, atid a moderatebulk was sold in the white hail, These are satisfactory symptoms, and give strength to the hopes generally entertained that the worst of the monetary and commercial crisis is past. It is to this hopeful feeling, no doubt, that the improvement in the price of wool at the current sales in London is attributable in a great degree, but the advance is believed by many here to have arisen from some trade speculators, who have operated freely. Still an improvement in the demand for woollen goods must necessarily be followed by an advance in the price of the raw material-perhaps an advance equtal to the rates obtaiaed at the previous sales. HUDDERSFIELD, Nov. 17. There is a decidedly better feeling in this market, although very little business is xatually doing, either ihthe #varehonaes or the Cloth-hall. Confidence, however, appears to be to a great extent restored. Wool does not conti:ue to decline; indeed, the tendency to a retius to former prices is already manifesting itself.
TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow =ze, through vour influential columns, toadvocatethe case of a poor -"ticket-of-leave man," who, with his family (a wite and three children), is on the verge of starvation. He was transported and served the usual time,and then received his " tickek," having committed but one offence. He tried very hard last summer to raise sufficient money to take his family to Canada, where I have no doubt he would do well; but he did not succeed. He had some employment during the 8itting of Parliament in a law stationer's office. Since tben he has tried very hard to get emplovment, but bas failed. I fear he is but one of many of these unfortunate " tlket-of-leave men." I have come in contact with many of them, and I believe most of them are now living by thieving, driven to it in many iastances by absolute nece£sity, and in other instances follow. ing it through inclination. A large sum of money is an. nuially paid by the GoverDment to these men on relea-e 'rom prison, and you may rest assured that the greater part goes into the pocket of the publican, This institutiou has be#n tho means of saving many of these poor fellows, but it is langnisbing for wvait of funds, and instead of maintaing SO inmatea has not half that number, But to return to the individual case. I earnestly beg for help to save this faaily from starving. I will nost readily receive any contributions and see that they are properly appropriated. If you can find a corner for this letter, for the sake 'of the p= ata&ving family pray insert it. I am, Sir. vonr Vh,Ate-,. si4rotn H. C.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Taeday Evening. The railway-market opened withflatness, butsab. sequently improved, and closed generally the same ss yesterday. The various movements were solely from sympathy with the funds, the business trans. acted being unimportant. At 4 o'elock London at. d North-Western (notwithstanding the large sales lately made on Scotch banking account), Great Western, and South-Western showed an advance, while North-Eastern stocks, South-Eastern, and Eastern Counties were slightly lower. Canadian descriptions again receded, and East Indian left off at 10h to 102i, being an improvement of lOs. In foreign shares, Northern of France were better; oa the other hand, Estohrn of France and Paris and Lyons wrere heavy, and a reduction occurred ia Lombardo-Venetian. American securities were quiet; Tllinois Central, however, closed with increased firmness. Canada Government Bonds declined 10s. In mines a fall of 11. occurred in Alfred Consols. In joint-stock banks, Australasia were quoted 11. higher ; other descriptions were generally without alteration. In miscellaneous securities, E1nglish and Australian Copper, and Europeanl and American Steam improved, and a decline took place in the discount companies. mnPr7zNTAQvlTu An - - OANATA- =wungnam6 wti Leeda & Liverpool, 501 Boohdalo, 80 Covendtyy 100 LeIcester & Nton, 13 Warwick & Birm., 24 Grand Juinction, 491 oxford. 106 Warwick & Ijaptou, 9 Rennet and Axon, 61 Begent'a, 16161 Woreter & airm., 169 WATERWORIM R,rIlu, 4 Lambeth. 95 Southwack and Vaux.

RAILWAY INT.LLIGEBNc. GREAT 1ORnr ni? cnmr A Xh TOe annual meeting of this company was held at Aberdeen on Friday, Mr. John Stewart in the chair. The report, which has appeared in 2ac Tymet, was read by the Steretary. The ClaiRmAw said they had much reason to congratulate themselves on tha present position and prospeots of the coin pany; the increase in the revenue far exceeded their expectations. In the department of pamsenger traffic the revenue had increased 50 per cent. in two years, and in the goods traffic 15 per cent. This was the mnore gratifying, too, when it was considered that they started with a tariff of passenger fares 25 per cent, below those of any other line ia the kingdom, that they had provided carriages, first and third clas so uniformly alike and so comfortable, that the only difference between the classes consisted in the first class caibeng cushioned In the south it was too generally the wtsh of the companies to make second and third class carriages as uncomfortable as possible that as many psssengers s rossible might begot ihto the first-class carriages, bht on the Great North they had sought to provide for the comfortable accommodation of all classes, and with the most perfect success; the low fares, he had no doubt had tended greatly to produce the results before them, for it hid encouraged, he believed, many persons to make two journeys in placoe of one which they wotld only have made if tha fares had been at the highest rate of tariff. In 1866 they had carried 312,011 passengers, and in 1857 410,290 passen- ers. In 1856 they had carried 87,243 tons of goods, and in %57 121,285 tons. In 1856 they had 33,3754 cattlo, sheep, and pigs over the line, and in 1857 36,314, with every prospect of a progressive increaso. The total working expenses, notwithstanding all this increase of traffic, was only per cent., and they had added four new eDgines to their plant, while all of it was in the best possible order, their rule being to keep the plant in the best possible condition, so that it might be as good at the end of the year as the beginning of it, with a sinldng fund forcoxtingences. They were greatly indebted to their secretary, Mr. Milue for the successful working of their establishment, and to all the officers for the harmony and effilciency with which they discharged their duties. With respect to tho branches the directors had laid down this principle for their guidance-viz., to make no branches, but help tae peo le in the districts where branches were needed to hel hem selves. This principle had been most sucoesafi The Oldmneldrum branch was remunerative to the company; the Inverury and Turriff line was also of that character; the Banff, Macduff, and Tarriff line would add much to their traffic; aad the Alford Valley brAnch was progressing. It was the intention of the direotors to support the Formar. tine and Brechin line by a subscription of 50,000L, and, as Lord Saltoun and Sir Charles Bannerman, and other landed proprietors who supported the opposition line last year had now come over to them, theyhad every reason to belevethat they would sncceed i getting a Bill for this line in the next eession of Parliament. Resolations approving the report were unanimously passed, and the meeting separated. STIRLING AND DUNFFIMLINE. A special meeting of this company was held at Edinburgh on Monday, for the purpose of considering a proposed agreement with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company, withdrawing the appeals on both sides from the House of Lords, and the latter ofering to pay the sum of 10,0004 as an acquittance of claims for arreas and estimated liabilities, amounting to 11,5001., and to pay 4per cent, on an assumed capital of 680,0001 (including l30,0001 of debentures), the Stirling and Danfermline foregoing the prospect of halfprofits. Mr. ANsrUrTR, the chairman, stated that In sbmitting a report on the subject to the shareholders the directors, not being unanimous, did not express any opion As a shareholder, however, he was of opinion that the pro. posed agreementshouldbe carried out. If the agreement was not entered into, it was calculated that the arbiter's award would amount to 590,000t., the interest of whioh at 4 per cent. was 23,6001 From this capital wasto be deducted i30,000L debentures, the interest on which, a. thepresentaverage of 41. 12s. 3, was 5,9961.; leaving 17,6031. From this fell to be deducted expenses of renewals, taxes, and management, 6031.; balance, 17,0001,; which, divided among the shareholders, would yieldl3s. Id. er share but subject to the fluctuation of the rate of debenture interest. If the fleement was accepted, the capital was to be held at 580,0001., from which they wonld have to deduct 130,0001. debentures to be paid by the Edinburgh and Glasgowv, leavlog 450,000t., upon which the Eidinburgh and Glasgow was to pay 18,0001., which, divided among the shareholders, was equla to 13g lid. per share of 151, -or 4t 12s. 2d. per cent. or 41. per oent. on 171. 6s. 2d. The additional claims oi 11,50Otwere to be foregone for apresent payment of 10,0001. as at 4th of June last. He moved that the proposed adjust. ment of the outstanding questions be approved and confirmed, and that the directors of the company be inatructod to take or concur in such measures as may be ncoessary to carry it into effect. Mr. Wimv seconided the motion. He represented the Advantage of getting rid of their protracted and troublesome litfgations with the leasig company. Several shareholders having expressed themselves favourable to the arrangement, the motion of the chairman was adopted nems dis, ALFORD VALLEY. The shareholders met on Friday in Aberdeen. A satisactozrystatement of the progress of the works was made, and intimation given that the line would be opened in August next. BANFF, MACDUFF, AND TURRIFF JUNCTION. The annual meeting of this company was held in Aberdeen on Friday; Mr. Stewrart inthe chair. The report has appeared in l7ie Times. The CriHtlRarAh said their progress had been all that they could have expected, and they had reason to bellove that a dividend would be declared at the next annual meeting of the company, TRAFFIC RETURNS.

Tim l Si=l OF Daisr.-The exploion party, under Lieutenants Home and Salkeld, wbich tso gallantly performed the desperate duty of blowing in the Cashmeregate of the oity of Delhi, in broad dayli, in the face of the enemy, on the 14th of September, wsa composed of the two offlicers above named, Sergeant John Smith, Sergeant A. B. Carmichael, and Corporal F. Burgess, all of the Sappers and Miners; Bugler axwthorno, Her Majesty's 62d Foot; 14 8appers and Miners, natives- and 10 Panjab ditto, musbees, covered by the fire of iter Majestys 66tb Rifles. The party advanced at the double towards the gate, I,eutenant Rome, with Sergeants Smith and Carmichael and Havildar Madhoo, of the Sappers, leading and carryini the powder bags, followod by Lieutenant Salkeld, Corporal Burgess, and a section of the remainder of the party. The advance party reached the gateway unhurt, and found that part of the drawbridge had been destroyed, but, passing across the precarious footing supplied by the remaining beams, they proceeded to lodge their povwder hae againsc the gate. The wickek was open, and through it tho enemy kept up aheavy fire upon them. Sergeant Carmichael wtas killed while laying the pwrder, Haviidar hiadhoo being atc the same time wrounded. The powrder having been Laid, the advance party slippei don into the ditch, to allow the firing party, nnder iutenant Salkeld to perform its duty. lVhile endeavonringto fire the charge Lieutenant Salkeld was shot through. the leg and arm, and banded over the slow match to Corporal Bturgess, who fell mortally wounded, just as he had successfuUy accomplihed this arduous duty. Havildar Tilluek Sigh, of the Sikh Muzbees, was wotnded, and Rembeth, Sepoy, of the same corps. killed, during this parb of the operation. The demolition o' the gate having been most successful, Lieu. tenant Rome, happily unhurt, caused the hugler to sound the call to the 52d as the signal for tho advanclng columns, hut fearing that amid the noise of the assault tha. sound might not have been heard, he had the call repeated thre timnes, when the troops advance) and carried the gateway with com plete success-thus maost materially contributing to the brilliant success of the day.

PARLIAMENTARY REFORA M31ANIFESTO, Aix Address to the people of the United Kingdom, esoz bodying a scheme of Parliamentary Reform, of which a cop7 is given below, and emanating from a committee composeD partly of mnembers of the Honse of Commons and others 4f the advanced Liberal class of politicians, has just beea printed, and is now in course of circlatlion and signature. It may not be generally known that towards the end of June last a meeting was held at the King's Arms Hotel, Palace-yard, of men both In and oat of Parliament, with the view of enlisting under one banner, so to speak, as many notable individuals s possible in all parts of the country in favoar of a reform in the representativo system, and of reducing theirviews upon the aubjectotsomethinglikea creed, for which they woald be prepared to contend when. ever the question was again brought under the considention of P^rliament, either by Lord PaiMnerton or any other mnember. At that meetiag, which was held vith closed doors as being only of a preliminary charaoter, there were about 30 members of Parliament and others present, including among the re-t Mr. Iloeback, M.P., who acted as chairman, Mr. Ayrton, X.P, 5Ir Clay, M.P., Sir John Trelamny, M.P., Mr. Platt, M.P. (now dead), Mr. R. N. Philips, M.P., Mr. Gilpin, I.P., Mr. White, AP., Mr. W. Williams, MP., Mr. Samuel Morley, and Mr. Edward MiAll. The result of their deliberations was the appointment of a committee, condsting of several of the gentlemen already named and others, with Mr. Roebuck at their head, who were chargod with 'the duty of drawing up a programmae of Parliamean tary Reform, and of submitting it for approval and saggestIon to the leading Reformerg throughout the kingdom. The committee preparedsuch aprojeot acoordingly, and have lately been engaged by meang of correspondence in eiiciting the opinions upon it of men of that class residing at a distance from the metropolis, and sabsequently in sItaring and resnoulding it so as to bring it into harmony with the prevailing feeling on the subject. In this shape it was finally settledandadopted atameeting of thecommitteeheld recently atthe Gaildhall coffee-hoase,at which Mr. Ayrton, HLP., 3r. Clay, .LP., Mr. Gilpin, . P., Mr. White, MP., Mr. W. Williams, M.P., Mr. Edward Mull, Mr. Samael Morley, Mr. J. P. Gasslot, Mr. Whitehurst, secretary to the Billot Soclety, and others, were in attendance. It was not, how. ever, we beUeve unanimously agreed to. Mr. Ayrton, for one, it Is understood, took exception to parts of it, and especially to the proposition for extending the county franchise to 10. occapiers, which he thought would swamp the legitimate inflaence of property in the election of knights of the shire, and tend toarray town against country in a way to which he was altogether adverse. The manifesto as approved is as follows:- 4To TEE PZOPLX OF GREAT BRITAX A_ND IBELA.cD. " Fellow Coantrymen,-Hrer Majesty's Government have led you to expect that they wUil lay before ParUament, next session, a Bill for the reform of the House of Commons. In that announcement you heard the echo of the determination you avowed at the late general election. It bids you i-peak again, and with more precision. That that promis mnay not be illusory, it behoves yon to make kno wn the snse in which yoa wil accept it, "You seek Parliamentary Reform in order to insure Ministerial responsbility. No measure failing of thim would answer your object. Have you a right to anticipate that with this end in view Goveornment will spontaneously offer whhat yot will be satisfied to receive ? If disposed to help you, they will be glad of your instructions-if indisposed, It were well to let them know your demands. In anJy case you are caUed upen to say what wil content you, or your tilence will surely be construed into X a of interest in the subject. " The existing machinery for the constitutional expression of public opinion is inadequate, and to a large extent untrustworthy. The constituent body is needlessly restricted. Considerable portions of It *re exposed to the disturbing action of illicit influences. A large majority of members is returned by a small minority of electors. The legal tornt of Parliaments is too long to insure the responsibility of representatives to the represented. These are the main defects of the present saytem The results are class legisla. tion, bad administration, financial extravagance, and a foreign policy always beyond your control, and often opposed to your wishes. " A Reform Bill that will remedy these defects wiU no doubt satisfy you. MIore anxious for a substantialy true representation of your wants and interests than for a theoreticaly perfect one, you will not reject a machinery whioh promises to do your work because it is not scienttfically exact. But while, on the one hand, yon forbear to demand what, In the present state of public opinion, is plainly unattainable, beware, on the other, lest, presuming on your inaction, the Government sbould force upon you a deceptive and inadequate measure. Should you permit yourselves to be defrauded of the advantago which the passing opportunity offers you, a quarter of a century may elapse before you are favoured with another. " Fellow-countrymen,-We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, diselaaming all right or desire to diotate, but anxious to elioit a definite expression of your will, and waving abstract rights, recommend you to insist upon the following leading features of Parliamentary Reform, as calculated to unite in support of them the largest number of voices, as capable of being attained by resolute and united efforts, and as promisnDg, if adopted, tD secure a real and effective representation of your political interests:- " L The extension of the borough franchise in England and Wales to every male person of ful age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall occupy as owner or tenant in part or whole any premises wishin the borough which are rated to the relief of the poor. " 2 The extension of the connty fraachise in England and Wales to all 101. occupiers at least; and the assimilstion, as far as possible, of the franchise in Scotland and Ireland to those of England and Wales. " 3. Protection to the voter by the balot on a plan similar to that adopted in the Australian colonies. " 4. A reappointment of se.ts, that shall make suoh an approach to an equalization of constituencies as shall give in the united kingdom a majority of membsrs to a majority of electors. "5. Abolition of property qualificatlon for members. "6. The calling of a new Parliament every three years, Fellow-countrymen,-If this broad outline of Parlia. mentary reform meets your view-if. in your judgment, it is adaspted to the occasion-if it comprehends as much as you can hope to get and as little as you could be satisfied to accept-it is for you to say so, and to say so in time. This business is yours, and if you wish It done you must do It yourselves. On our part we are ready to aid yoa, a best we may, in placing this sketch of reform, properlyfilled in, upon the statute book of the realm."
THE PAS3PORT SYSTEBR IN FRANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The following illustration of the inefficiency of the passport system in France may be of use for the present discussion:- Daring "the long war," when Ferdinand vir. of Spain was a prlsoner in Vincennes, the EngUsh Government wished to obtain his release from captivity and from France. Foueh6, as well as Bonaparte, was awrare of this, and took every precaution to preTent any private communication with the Royal prisoner. In spite of every effort on their part he was visited repeatedly in Tincennes by an agent of the English Government, and every preparation was rade for his escape, including tho providing of paesports, en re'gle, for himself and those who were to accompany him-one, at least, of those passports being signed by Fouobe himself. That one was a pass which would have carried the King freely through even the French armies. The smaU modicnm of plack whichl belonged to-Ferdinand VII. failed him at the last hour, wheD it was necessary for bim to put on the clothes of & mason as a disguise * and the English agent, after waiting in vain several days ia hope of a zevival of the Royal courage, left and rehnrned to England.

LONYDOz, WEDNESDAY, NOT'EMBEB 18, 1857. Some time ago, in alluding to the contingencies by which our position in India might be still further embarrassed, Mr. DIsAExLr remarked upon the possible defection of the Mabratta Princes. The allegiance of these stiU powerful rulers to the British Government might undoubtedly have been considered questionable at a conjuncture when treason appeared rampant throughout the territories of Bengal, for the dominion of the great Mahratta confederacy was still fresh in the minds of the natives, and it may be said that in establishing ,our own supremacy in India we did so to the prejudice of this league rather than to that of the Mogul dynasty. The Mahratta Princes had already superseded the descendants of TImouR, and were the true lords of Delhi; nor was it indeed until the very close of the reign Of GEORGE III. that we at last succeeded in treaking this formidable power. Even then, although we deposed the PnlssiwA at Poonah, and although the GuicowAR i- Guzerat and the Rajahs of Berar and Nagpore in the Deccan were reduced to the position of protected chiefs, the other members of the confederacy, the representatives of the famous DowLuT RAo SCiND.&n and JEswuNr RAo HoLuKA, were left in a state of independence, which was not materially modified until after the campaign of 1843. At a still later period has the ever expanding dominion of the British been encroaching upon the rellc3 of Mahratta rule, for, besides the notorious case of Sattara, the considerable inheritance of Nagpore escheated to us, as the supreme lords of India, but a year or two nince. That victories and acquisitiora of such recent date might have left serious ranklings in the minds of the Mahratta Pripces was naturally to be anticipated, and we ,have seen, Indeed, the effects of this resentment in the abortive conspiracies at Poonah, the old seat of the PEsawAs, and in the maniacal atrocities of NAN& Srs, who, though not legally, even by adoption, a representative of th& Peishwa BR&M RI.o, conceived himself aggrieved in being excluded from the succe3sion to his pension. it now deserves, however, to be especially recorded, both for the information and gratitude of the country, that the chief Princes of the Mahratta stock, ScINDIAH andHoLEAnR, have maintained and declared throughout these mutinies their firm attachment to the British Government, and their adhesion to us through the temptations of so unexampled a crisis has been attended with consequences of the utmost importance to our ascendancy. Gwalior, the capital of ScwDiA'S territories, stands in the immediate vicinity of our North-Western Provinces, being only some 70 miles from Agra, 200 from Delhi, and less than that distance from Cawnpore; so that it might have been made a base of operations by the mutineers of Central India, and if the garrisons of Neemuch, Nusseerabad, and Jhansi had concentrated their forces on this point our commanders might have found there a second Delhi. The views of SCIND2IA, however, were so promptly and so firmly declared that such a proceeding was out of the question, and the only trouble experienced by these Mahratta rulers was occasioned by the behaviour of their own Contingents. We have before explained that this term is applied to bodies of native troops paid by the native lord of the State, but organized and officered by ourselves, and resembling, in fact, the ordinary battalions of the Sepoy army. If the Princes desire to maintain any military force of their own, they must do so in addition to the " Contingent' they are required to furnish. We have been placed In possession of some mcsb interesting particulars respecting the actual behaviour of SCINDIAH in the extremities to which he was driven, and we lay them before the public as evidence of the good faith which, under circumstances of singular temptation, and even urgent pressure, that Prince has observed towards us. The Contingents of himself and HoLKAr showed how truly they had been framed upon the Bengal model by revolting as promptly and as wantonly as the Sepoys themselves, and the mutineers from Indore marched up and joined the mutineers at Gwalior, where the whole body-many thousands strong-was thus collected. At the beginning of September, however, a difference of opinion occurred between them as to the destination which was most desirable, the Indore people wishing to march upon Delhi, the Gwalior men upon Cawnpore. The dispute ended at last in a division, and on the 5th of September-the reader should remark the critical importance of these dates in connexion with the late operations-the Indore troops decamped by themselves, and occupied the fort of Dholpore, about 30 miles from Agra, exactly at the point where the Trunk Road from Delhi to Bombay crosses the river Chumbul. Before depart. ing they bargained with the Gwalior mutineers for supplies and ammunition, and received from these insurgents 2,400 pounds of powder, 3,000 shot of various sizes, and 30 rounds of ball cartridge per man. SOINDIAH was thus relieved of a troublesome body of visitors, but his own Contingent was still so strong as not to be immediately controlable by his private army. However, he called out all the troops he could muster, invited assistance from the neighbouring landholders, and planted his batteries against the camp of the mutineers. Two days after the departure of the Indore brigadethat is to say on the 7th of September, exactly one week before the assault upon Delhi, the Gwalior Contingent determined upon marching also, and, if it could have succeeded in its object, it would have carried a vigorous and disciplined force to the aid of our enemies either at Delhi or Lucknow. Hitherto, though avowedly in insurrection against the British Government, they had paid a certain imperfect obedience to the authority of Sci'nDxAn, by whom they had been kept stationary, and even now, as they had parted with so much of their aammunition, it was necessary that they should obtain sonie assistance from his stores before they could march. Accordingly, the native officers of the Contingent waited upon him at his Court, or Durbar, and, after expressing their attachment and fidelity to the Mahratta throne, intimated their desire of departing on active service, and their wish for supplies. To this application SCIDiAR replied, that if they were indeed, as they described themselves, his servants, they must wait for his orders before they thought of marching anywhere, and he refused plainly to fnrnish them with any provisions whatever. This rebuff provoked some insolence on their part, but they were fain to retire to their camp unsati;idod, and in the inter -O SCINDIAL'S means of resiscanee had been graduaiqy ;-eased. Still, tAe disciplined forces of the Contingent were so formidable that the Mahratta Prince was fain to temporize, until at last, the mutineers having been weakened by desertion, while his own levies were greatly strengthened, he was enabled to act with decision. The revolters at first appealed to HoLx}n's Contingent to return to their asistance from Dholpore; but finding all resources vain, and being surrounded by SciNDwt.'s retainers in overpowering numbers, they laid down their arms in obedience to a summons, and are said to have dispersed to their own homes much about the time that HAvELoci's column was advancing from Cawnpore upon Lucknow. We need not dilate upon the service thus rendered to the British cause. The importance of this compact body of troops at such a conjuncture was so keenly appreciated that emissaries from NANA SAHIB and from the Royal Family at Delhi were bidding against each other for their services, and we can only trust that the statement now before us reporting their effectual dispersion has not been exaggerated. It is sufficiently clear, however, that our obligations to a Prince who has thus been not merely neutral, but energetically aotive in our favour, must be very great, and they are not likely to be overlooked in the arrangements which impend. An opposite decision in the case of so powerful a chieftain as ScDLiE nI might have turned the scale against us until reinforcements enabled our Government to conquer the country afresh, and this, in conjunction with several other examples, or, as we may say, in connexion with the almost universal adhesion of the native Princes to our cause, may well suggest a doubt whether the preservation of native States may not be conducive to the tranquil maintenance of our supremacy. We do not think these principalities have ever been annexed except upon grounds justifiable in rigorous argument; but, though such proceedings were certainly not crimes, they may possibly, in some instances, have been blunders, and the behaviour of the Mahratta Princes is eminently calculated to open the question foD public consideration.
We publish in another column a Manifesto from the more ardent school of Parliamentary Reformers -Mr. RoBuc%, Mr. CLAY, Sir JoN TRnLX&WNY, and others,-containing the outline of a scheme of Parliamentary Reform which they recommend to the support of the publio. This Maniesto is isued on the expectation of the subject being discussed next esdon, which they remind Government " they have " been led to expect." For our part, however, we maut be allowed to repeat the opinion which we expressed a few days ago, that this subject had better be postponed. Indeed, such a conlluence of conaider. ations suggests the postponement of Parliamentary Reform that the difficulty lies, not in stating them, but in stating acU of them; in doing justice to their nutmber and force; in not omitting some while we mentionothers. When we last wrote on this subject these considerations gathered round the Indian Mutiny; but within these few days another great subject has been added-the Bank Charter. In the first place, then, even supposing the discussion of these two great subjects-the Indian Mutiny and the infringement of the Bank Chartercould be postponed to another session--even supposing this step were possible, what would be its practical result? You would gain indeed one solitary advantage by it,-viz., that Parliamentary Reform would be discussed one session earlier, instead of one session later. We do not deny that this, taken simply by itself, would be an advantage, though we think its measure and importance may be overrated. But now see the disadvantages which we must set against this advantage I It is quite true that earlier justice is gained to one subject by such a course, but how do you treat the other two? Is anything like justice, either earlier or later justice, done to these most important and national subjects ? Suppose next session over, and a new Parliament met. Is a new Parliament in its first session the most competent judge of two very difficult, intricate, and involved questions-questions requiring knowledge as well as fluency? Ask any of our new members if they have even found " their sea legs" by the end of their first session, and then consider what sort of a Parliament this course of proceeding wil provide you for the re-settlement of our Indian Empire and the consideration of the Bank Charter. An awkward, strange policy it would be, indeed, to dismiss an able and painstaking Parliament just after it has got into work, and just after it has settled down into regularity and clearedcits ground, with these two questions unsettled, in order that you may hand them over to the crude deliberation of a new raw Parliament i For we assume that a new Parliament wil immediately succeed the new Reform BiU ; otherwise, of what use is this reform? It would be a bad compliment to pay to the hyper-reformed and reconstructed Legislature to be keeping the old one on for the very purpose of rescuing subjects out of the hands of its successor-nay, to have to give for our very reason why we thus forestall it the importance and gravity of these subjects, as if the new Parliament might be trusted with trivial questions, but not with important ones. This would be very like belying our own professions, and showing, amid all our apparent desire for change, a slinking preference for the un-reformed Parliament. So then, we say, there must be a new Parliament after a new Reform BiU, and then we are in this strange dilemma,that we are actuaUy and gratuitously taking the consideration of these national questions out of the hands of a settled and tried Parliament, in order that we may reserve themlfor a new and crudo one. But the truth is, the whole supposition on which we have been arguing here is an impossible one. The Indian Mutiny and the infringement of the Bank Charter are qnestions which cannot possibly be postponed to another Parliament; they must be considered, and considered thoroughly, largely, and completely in the ensung session. Everybody with a particle of practical sense must se3 this. There are some questions which dictate their own time of settlement; in politics, as in daily life, there are questions which must be settlea: when they come up, the very reasons that they must be decided at all requiring that they must 'be decided instantly, or as soon as they possibly can be. The Indian Mutiny and the suspension of the Bank Charter are questions of this kind. Compare the urgency of these two new questions-questions of the day and the hour-with the familiar stationary look of the old stagers which come up in this Manifesto-the Ballot, Triennial Parliaments, a Poor-rate standard of the Borough Franchise, a Ten-pound House. holder Franchise for Counties, Equalization of Constituencies, Abolition of Property Qualification for Members. Have we here such severe, urgent, large, and popular grievances that we must instantaneously deal with them r fall into ntter confusion? Not a moment to be lost on the question of Triennial Parliaments or the Bi" i ? Cannot the Equalization of Constituencies and tha Abolition of Property Qualification waitone sessoni' We think they can. Some of there grievances-if grievances at all-it is ridiculous even to sr a c i as serious, and of none can wve say that aro pressing. But, if the Indian Mutiny aDa X i Charter must be diousrs n -b session, h: -tuestion of the discussitSa .1; earliamentary R-eform next ses3ion is reduced to a very narrow compass. Omnipotent Time now comes in with a supreme and irresistible veto. There are but so many weeks in a session and so many Parliamentary working days in a week. Consult your almanac, and see if you can insert even one extempore intercalary month anywhere in it, to devote to a question which naturally requires a whole session to itself. It is plain, upon the slightest estimate we can form of the copiousness of these three subjects--the reorganization of India and the retrospective discussion of the Mutiny, the Bank Charter and its necessary episodes, and the Reform Bl-l-that they cannot all of them be discussed in one session, and therefore that whichever can giveway must give way. Parliamentary Reform happens to be the accommodating one of the three in point of time; it is not positively necessary next year ; it is therefore the subject to give way. This will be a disappointment to some very respectable men, but it really cannot be helped,we cannot do everything at once. Is it better that we should simply postpone what we can postpone to another session, or that we should crowd three tremendous questions into one session, at the certain cost of doing the greatest injustice to all three of them? Will not the Parliamentary Reformer himself be better satisfied with having a session, though a later one, to himself ? Is he likely to be pleased and contented with the amount of attention which he wil be able to secure for his own subject in a general scramble when men's minds are occupied with other matters of urgent interest ? Is justice likely to be done to so great a question as that of Pariamentary Reform under such circumstances? And, besides the want of time, will there not aBo be want of heart, energy, and spirit in the constraction of a new Reform Bill under such difficulties? Will not the withdrawal of attention from the subject of Parliamentary Reform, in consequence of these other more urgent claims upon the House, give room for weakness and what the stem Reformer will call treachery in the construction of the new Bill! Men in office and men in Parliament are not so fond of the disagreeable task of interfering with patronage, and offending men of influence and social position. They will infallibly shirk it if they can, and the general diversion of attention from the subject will enable them to do this. We cannot but think, on the whole, that Parliamentary Reform had better wait-even for the sake of Parliamentary Reform itself-till an undivided public attention to the subject can zecure due justlce to it, till a public opinion, set free from the present engrossing claimz upon it, can watch the progrems of such a Bill with proper jealousy, back up Reformers in resistanoe to patty obstacles and private interests, and secure an effective settlement, instead of a corrupt bargain.
Always have an under-plot to your drama, and take care that the under-plot has as little to do with the main plot as posible. Thi was the principle on which Mr. Purr composed his tragedy, and he seems to have been justified by the philosophy of history. Great events often have contemporaneous with them something analogous and subordinate which runs a separate course, and is defrauded of the notice of mankind by the brilliancy of its rival. Such is certainly the case with the Chinese question. We can hardly recall that a few months since the English political world was convulsed by the affair of the lorcha Arrow ; that Parliamentary orators outdid themselves in eloquence; that aged lawyers applied to the subject their aeutest logic; that the most popular Minister of the age was left in a minority, and reinstated in power by the sufrages of a general election. Yet, notwithstanding the all- absorbing interest of the Indian Mutiny, the Chinese question is still unsettled. It is only small by comparison, and whenever the rebels of Central India shall be swept away, and the tale of Delhi become a little trite, we shall find China again in the ascendant, and the doings of Lord ELGIN an object of interest to millions. People seem to require the excitement of these distant contests; it is a sort of political dram-drinking to which they are becoming accustomed; and now that we have settied most of our internal questions, and have little desire of organic change, the popular impulse, though disavowed and perhaps hardly perceived, runs strongly in favour of those enterprises which unite so strangely the spirit of war and commerce. Yet we have no cdesire that they should be undertaken as a boast or carried out as a spectacle. They are often, as in the cese of the Canton affair, the natural result of the contact of a restless, adventurous race, with the self-esteem and bigotry of semi-civilization. In all cases, however, they should be settled as speedily and vigorously as possible. The educated and thinking men who approve them look forward to a result nnore solid than glory and more durable than the rejoicings for victory. The spread of knowledge, religion, and culture is what they desire for humanity, while as patriots they are not indifferent to the extension of British power and prosperity. So, if matters can be settled satisfactorily, they care little whether the nation can spare time and attention to applaud the sill and vigour displayed. Now, at present, there is no doubt that the public think nothing about China, while in another year an Embassy to Pekin, or some brilliant operations on the coast, would renew the excitement of the Crimea, the Baltic, and India. Yet, if the matter can be brought to a conclusion now, there is no reason for delay. Still less should we acquiesce in inactivity if we have reason to know that the lapse of a twelvemonth will render our opponents more obstinate and the situation more difficult. The state of affair. at present is singular enough. We have invited half the civilized world to a great military and diplomatic spectacle, and then failed to make our appearance. French, Americans, Russians, Portuguese are waiting for the curtain to rise and the entertainment to begin. For some twelve months we have been on the point of commencing operations at Canton and negotiations further north, but as yet the frigates and steamers are lying idly at their moorings, and the highest excitement of the blue - jackets ix to stop some junk which looks like a pirate, or some paltry lorcha which tries to break the blockade. Lord ELGIN iS a Commissioner without a commission; General AsHnuRwHAm is a commander without an army. It cannot be wondered that the representatives of the other Powers should be getting impatient and independent. Indeed, there is plenty of food for sarcasm in the position of our affairs-a large field for the ambition of any foreign State which may aspire to take the lead,. which we seem incapable of keeping. This condition of things is the not unnatural result of such an expedition of all nations as the Chinese affair was made, and shows how much the interests of the cotntry may suffer from the unscrupulous efforts of fiction, which force the Government to take a lower tone with foreign Powers, and admit them to co-operation in what should be a purely nati.mn1 enterprise. If England should not wage L* ihute war she should as certainly not wage a joint-stock war. When this country hampered itself by soliciting the countenance of other States in a contest with a Chinese Governor it committed an act which we sincerely trust will never be repeated. The Russians, who contermplate a great extension of their empire at the expense of China, and are labouring at the establishment of a naval and commercial power on the Pacific, have not been idle. We certainly do not see with much alarm these efforts of a State which has lately failed so signally in Europe. The Amoor is divided from the real seat of Russian power by thousands of miles of wilderness, and the settlements on the Pacific must, in case of a war, easily fall into the hands of an enemy. In fact, they were only saved to the CZAR by the premature peace of 1856. Nor are they likely to have any immediate effect on China. The real, populous, rich, and busy China is to the south, accessible to our transport ships and gunboats, and must inevitably be brought into closer relation with the Power which governs India than with the possessors of the Siberian wilds. But still th. spirit which animates the Russians is worthy of notice. Both Muscovite and Briton may well have the feeling that their respective empires are inevitable and eternal rivals. England and Russia are the two nations of the Old World which have the strongest vitality, and they represent principles which can never be reconciled. Our enmities or friendships with other nations may be merely transitory, dependent on some local question, some interest of the hour. But as long as the Russians form an aggressive Asiatic Power we and they must always be antagonistic. Other nations we care little about; they ease their minds by abusing us in journals, and are satisfied. But Russia is quite another kind of opponent, and, though we have had the better of her of late years both in Europe and Asia, no one who watches her will beleve that her resources are exhausted or her spirit tamed. Count PUTIATIN left St. Petersburg about the time that the British electors made their demonstration for Lord PALManSTO2, and arrived at the Aaoor overland in 70 days. He steamed down to the mouth of the Pei-ho and sent a messenger to the Court of Pekin. The Russian Admiral has no force, and the embassy is of an ostentatiously pacific character. However, -we do not know what influences may be brought to bear inland, nor how far the presence of a Russian emissary in the Pacific may not be a blind to other negotiations. The evident object of the Russians is to place an Embassy at Poldin, which may give them a power not obtainable by other nations. It is probable, however, that they will be foiled by the obstinacy of the Imperial Court. In fact, China knows and dreads the CaUi much less than the English Government, since the latter threatens the largo towns, the coast, and the mouths of the great rivers, while the Russians are divided from the seats of wealth and power by the whole breadth of Tartry. But it is not only the Russians -who have endeavoured to forestall us. The Americans are said to have endeavoured to commence negotiations with YEHI. This acheme was) however, put an end to by the blockade instituted by Sir McHA&a SEYMOBR. Our American friends must therefore proceed regularly by means of Mr. REBD and the constituted authorities of the Celestial Empire. YBH and his yamun are for the present debarred from communication with the outside world. Yet we cannot expect this state of things to continue. Not only the Russians, but the Americans, the French, and the whole race of small European Powers will have a right to ask us what we intend to do. Is the blockade of Canton to last for ever t Does Lord EwrGN Intend to proceed by war or negotiation ? It is pretty evident that an appeal to the ESTPE0ou wiU effect nothing. At all the northern ports the Chinese are very glad to see Englishmen, will sell us all the tea and silk we want, allow travellers to go as far as they like into the interior, and wil ship themselves in thousands to the Australian colonies. But they will not fight or negotiate. What, then, are we to do with these atolid Orientals ? It would be an absurdity and a cruelty to injure them for the excesses of the Canton mob; while a demand for an Embassy at Pekin would probably be answered after the lapse of a year by a provokingly well-written refusal. The conclusion to which every one must come is that this Caaiton affair should be settled by itself. Why should we not take Canton, reoccupy Chusan, and then commence negotiation 7 Of course, the answer is that there are no men, and it is a valid one for the moment. But we must certainly call attention to the fact that the Chinese question requires a speedy settlement. If by. any means troops can be spared they wiU be well employed in bringing matters to an issue. A very few would probably be sufficient for the frst operations, and when India is fairly settled more might follow. Anything is better than the inactivity whiclh now seems to prevaiL
Very seldom has a tale of villainy been unfolded which, whether we regard the heartlessness of the offenders, or the misery of the victim, or the fatuity of every individual concerned, is more astonishing than that which came to light at the Lambeth Police-court on Saturday last. Out of incidents not very different from those which belong to the history of the brothers WDrs the grand old tragedians of Athens, to whom the most wonderfuil characteristic of human crime was its utter folly, and who could scarcely bring themselves to believe that men are accountable for such stupidity, would have constructed a drama in which every act and every word should bear the impress of a rigid fate and a divine decree, and all that at the last an avenging fate might overwhelm innocent and guilty alike in one fightful catastrophe. Some time in the summer of 1850 Joni BLAI Wmr,s, then a medical student, met a young girl in an omnibus, and was so smitten with her charms that he at once followed her to her residence. By great perseverance he made the discovery that the young lady was a iMfiss MAuIoN MAxwmL, and that her relatives resided at Bath. To Bath the excited lover forthwith hurried; he found out the girl's mother, and at once made an offer of marriage. There was only one bar to the union, but that was impassable for the timethe girl was not 13 years of age. Delay was necessary, and so the matter seemed to end. Here is a fate, as it would seem, from the beginning-love at first sight, passion bolling up in a moment, and apparently gone as quickly. But this so-called fate prevails once more, and by mere accident the pair meet again at the Surrey-gardens after a lapse of nearly five years. The passion of MIr. Wu.s is again excited, he determines to have the lady for his bride, with the consent of her mother they are married at Kennington Church on the 24th of March, 1855, and they appear to live very happily together until at length a child is born. With the birth of a child, however, comes a fever which, ultimately affects the mother's mind, and she is accordingly placed in the Bethlehem Hospital, where she remains for a year. It appears to be one of the regulations of 'this institution that persons in the position of the patient shall not remain for more than a year, and accordingly a request was made to her husband that, although her recovery was still incomplete, she should be removed. Her husband paid no attention to the request, but his brother, Mr. JIAMES FENTow WLLS, went to the hospital aud removed his sister-in-law to the residence of his mother. This took place on the 3d of August last, and here the complications commence. Where was the husband all this time that his wife was thus oppressed with the most affecting malady to which human life is subject-a malady, too, induced under circumstances which might well have softened his heart? Mr. Joum Wnas had in the meantime solaced himself with another wife-. he married AN-z GOOD in April last. In the meantime the true Mrs. Wis, released from confinement, is anxious to see her husband and child, and after a few days he writes a letter to her, requesting that she would meet him somewhere in the city. The meeting takes place, and he has the effxontery,to repudiate his marriage, and not only to confess his bigamy, but also to declare that his first marriage was with AV GOOD so long ago as 1851. Apparently he had calculated on being able to impose on his wife in the weak state of her intellect, and he calculated correctly; but he never took into account that the very simplicity with which she could receive his statement and follow his direction must ultimately recoil upon himself and prove the instrument of his ruin. "The only " and best thing you can do," he said, "is to " marry my brother FENTOX; he loves you, will " marry you, and make you a good husband." This brother, too, professes to have believed the story of a previous marriage-believed it, too, without a tittle of proof save the word of the bigamist, and, fatuity on fatuity I the girl, who seemed to have had strength enough only to feel her misery and to appreciate little kindnes, at once accepts the addresses of her brother-inlaw, follows his directions, and on the 21st of August, but a few days after the interview with Jom WrLrs, commits an incestuous bigamy with JAx,Ms ! She, poor soul, is stil under age; and it was necessary for herself and her new husband to make a declaration-which, under the circumstances, was equivalent to perjury-that this marriage was solemnized with the consent of her mother. It was not likely that this second marriage could be long concealed from the lady's relatives. It soon came to the mother's ears. The mother came to town; inquiries were instituted; the register of ToHnx WiiS's second marriage was found in Somerset - house, with the date of April last; the double deception which he had practised was at once evident, and all the tisue of fale. hoods was laid bare by which this simpleminded girl was first of all wronged most eruelly, and then forced by the oppression of clearer intellects into the commission of a crime in which the monBtrosity of incest was added to the guilt of bigamy. Nor did this end the catalogue of the lady's wrongs. The result of the discovery was that Jsxs WILs at once threw off his obligations to the lady whom he had led Into an accursod marriage, and inhuman hatred seems to have succeeded to an unnatural love. He deserted her; the was thrown upon the parirh; he was reeoived into the Lambeth Infirmary; and it is by the oini cers of the parish that these iniquities have been brought to light. It is no extenuation of the injury which has been conmitted to say that Mrs. WILs is 4"incapable " of her own distress." It is rather the reverse. Well for her indeed that she can form no estimate of the extent of her injury, but woe to those who presume upon such weakness. WORDSWOR= never said a finer thing than when in hu solemn way he applied to idiots that verse of Scripture, "Their life is hid with CHElsT in GoD," and there is something so mysterious in the calamity with which those afflicted in their mind,i are visited that nations who regard them ws sacred do but exceed the common feeling of humanity, and thero is no naaa of serious thought who does not to some extent sympathize with the superstition. It is a superstition which gives some indication of the enormity of the crime which has been committed upon this woman, and which meets with at least this response in every manly heart-a fervent hope that the offenders may obtain the severe punishment which they deserve.

,82, JAEBS'S THEATBX. The ucceas of n7 CampaneUo and Signor Ferrarlo has not eneouoaged the management in Idleness; on the contrary, It Wuas baced up last night by another work unknown to EXngland, though very popular abroad-Cr?spino c la Comare (Crspino and the Fairy)-which met with great favour from a brilliant audience. Crespino is a poor cobbler, whom his wife, Annetta, endeavour to help out in his trade by elling ballads in the street. Their united efforts are of no avail; the cobbler is about to be diamissed from his lodgings, and in despair resolves to commit suidde by throwing himself into a yelL Just as he Is on the point of executing this project a fairy rsbesfrom the well, In the guise of an old woman. She dis. snades Crispino from his design, and promises to make him zichandprosperous. Iuobedience to the fairy'instructions he sets up as a doctor of medicine, and through her inviible aid per.rmsmiraculous cures, which obtain Jam wealthand fame on one hand, and the envy of all the " faculty " or the other. Puffed up by his good fortune, Crispino becomes Insolent and overbearing, and not only ilrents his wife, but uses vey uncourteous language to his benefactress her. self. To punish hia arroganoe the fairy transports him to her own subterranean abode, commands him to make his will, and informs him that his last hour is a' hand. On his exhibiting signs of repentance,however, and promising to behave better for the future, she pardons Crispino, and restores him to his home, where oertain ob. servations of his wife and friends soon convince him that the descent to the fairy's dwelUing, with all its aseompanying accidents, has been nothing more than a dream, the resolt of overexcitement. Why the fairy and her preternatura3 aciievemente in his behalf were not shown to be just aa visonary is left to the imagination of the spectator. The music by the brothers Riccl, one of whom composed the opera of Carramnuccia, is everything except ori1lnaior rather everything inalightand pleasant sense, smie it has no higher pretensions. It never flags, and, although It does not contmin a single piece, solo or concerted, that rises above the level of commonplae, or that is not made up of a variety of phrases and progressions which every frequenter of the Italian Opera has already heard in one shape or another, it is austained from first to last with such sprt and liveliness as could only have proceeded from a pen to which experience has imparted fluency and a thorough command of means. The mott effective points are the finale to Act 2, and the trio for male Toloes in Act 3-both of which created a marked sensatlon, " encores" being unanimously awarded to the most prominent pass. ages in each. The part of the cobbler was allotted to Signor Carrione, who on this occasion dropped the mask of Pulcinella, and with it whatever " fun" might be allowed to attach to his impersonation of Columella. This gentleman is delddedl clever, but just ase sentAlly dq; and we do not think such humour as he possess is ever lkely to find much sympathy out of his own oountry. He has little or no -voice but this, we are informed, is the chrcteristic of the genuine "Neapo.- litan buffo," which (to sing being one of the presumed duties of a singer) is a pity. Mademoiselle Tangioni-the prina donna amsoluwa-being indisposed, the chaacter of Annetta devolved upon Mademoiselle Fumigelli, of whose qualifications we have already spoken, and about whom it is enough to add, that she succeeded much better In light comedy than in sentimental drama. A new tenor, Signor Giorgetti, in a very insignificant chao racter (as the opera stands in the curtailed version presented at the St. James's Theatre), contrived to make a highly favourable impression. That Signor Giorgetti not only has a voice Of very agreeable quality, but knows how to emplo it to advantage, was proved last night in a romance (" Bella siocome un angelo") which he sang with the utmost taste and expreaion. Signor Castelli (bas), whose perfor. *-nce of a subordinate part was so much praised in the netice of Columella, fully substanUtiated all that was said of him on that occasion. In the trio to which allusion has been made, where Dr. Fabrizio (Signor di Giorgi) fnding the newly usurped position of the ci-dcvant cobbler, as a medical man, too firm to be shsaken, tries to persuade Mirabolano, a chymist= to joln him in a consultation-Signor CatelM hi hly distinguished himself. His delivery ef the pawage, uoi tornare al tuo panchetto," in which 3irobalano ridicules Crispino, was so full of dramatic point, and so vocally effective, that it raised the audience to enthusasim, and brought down an uproarious demand for a repetition. As an example of true comic music, this trio may take its place by the side of the one which made so lively an impression in the opera of Columtl&s; and it is acted and sum throughout by Signors Carrione, Di Giorgi, and Cas. with such wonderful spirit and animation that its effe,, us quitel rresistible. On the whole, Cri&pino e la Comoare is a much more favourable specimen of the genu'me " opera bnffa," now the vogue in Italy, than its predecessor, and was much better appreciated by the pubhic, to w hom the traditional "PIulci. nelia" had been a myth.

THB INDIAN MUTIN71RlR. THE FALL OF DRTILR We have been favoured with the following private ebter - .4" About the It of tlis month Brigadier Nicholson went out with a fozee and completely routed a large force of the enemy, taling 13 guns. About this time the siege-train of te&vy gnns arArved from the Poajab. Up to this time we er acting almost entirely on the defensive, We had not suicieat men or guns to commaence the siege, and It was all we could do with our small force to repel the numerous attac.s of the enemy. That time was, I think, the worst put of the whole. We 'wero often on duty three nights of very; reek, making defensive works. When once we begau the siege we knew we should soon take the place, which kept ts up to any work. On the 8th of September large working parties from all the regiments in camp paraded at the Rigineer-park, taking tools with them. We marched down to withln 300 yards of the walls and bastions of the city. TMe men were employed in filling sandbags and maldng the ground ready for the batteries. Previous to this for about a fortnight we had to go out at night with large workIng and covering parties, and out all the trees where the vorks vwere intended to be. That was the worst part of all, stumbling about al night in the long rank jungle, sometimes five feet high, wet through with the dew, and frequently attacked by the enemy. On the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th the batteries were completed. They were immensely large, built up to the bottom of the embrasures of solid fascines. 1,500 camels were employed nightly in carrying down the fasCines. Straneo to say, the enemy did not fire on us much while building the batteries. We were almost all of us on duty three nights running. On the 12th the batteries opened fire, when, after seeing the first salvo knock down a large portion of the Cashmere bastion, I was so tired that I lay down and slept during tho roar of the guns for three or four hours. There wre fourbatteries, one of them having 20 heavy gons and howitzers. The wails seemed to crumble before the weight of metal, and after two days' firing two breaches were made and a great part of the parapet stripped off the walL One sandbag battery was within 200 yards of the Water Bastion. The fire of musketry from the walls of the town at this bastion was tremeadous. The guns were obliged to have iron mantlets fixed on them to protect the men while working the guns. I waee in the battery when poor Captaiu Fagan, of the Artillery, was shot through the head with a 2nusket balL Hle would expose himself, though frequently warned. He used to get up and look over the mantlets to lay his guns better. Captain Taylor, Engineers, managed the attack admirably. He wae the director of the attack. On the night of the 13th he and Lieutenants Medley and Lang, Engineers, with two or three riflemen, crept up to the ditch and asoertained that the breaches were practicable, and got back again without being seen. Captain Taylor instantly determined on the assault for the following morning. There were five columns of attack. Two or three Engineer officers were told off to each by seniority. The seniors went with the first column, the next with the second; so Ward and myself, the unfortunate juniors (Carnegie and Forbes being sick), had to go with the fifth column or reserve; so I do not consider that we had so much danger, though the fire was rather sharp when we went in. All the Engineer officers in the other columns, except Home, Lang, and Thomason, were wounded. We paraded about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 4th with our separte columns, with Sappers, with powder-bags, &c., and marched down to the attack. It was juat daylight when the first column halted at a turn in the road which concealed them from view of the walls, but close to the Cashmere-gates. Lieutenant; Salkeld and Home, Sergeants Carmichael, Burgess, Smith, and four Sappers and a bugler of Her Majesty's 52d Regiment advanced from the column up to the Cashmeregate. It was an immensely heavy wooden gate, flanked on all sides by the walls. Rome laid the powder at the foot ,of the gate. They were instantly discovered, and a heavy fire opened on them from all sides. Sergeant Carmiohael took the fuse and was on the point of firing it, when he was shot dead by a Sepoy, who placed his musket through a hole in the wall. Sargeant Burgess took the fuse from his hand, and was likewise shot dead. Lieutenant Salkeld then took the fuse, and was shot through the arm and fell into the ditch, breaking his leg by the falL As he fell he threw up the fuse, which Sergeant Smith seized, and fired the charge. At the same time the bugler sounded the advance, and on rushed the column. The charge blew in the gate, and about 17 of the enemy who were close to It. Our troops rushed in, up the bastions and along the walls. At the same time the second and fourtk columns attacked by tho breaches, and the walls were cleared of all the defenders. The Cashmere-gate presented a horrible sight; 30 or 40 Sepoys, some blown up and otbers bayonetted and shot down, were lying all about. It was the same all along the valls. No quarter was given; but they made very little defence, wnd retired into the city, where they again made a stand. I went into the bastions. Such a scene of ruin you never saw. Almost every gun was dismounted, or had a -eat piece of iron knocked out of It, and dead Sepoys all around. The troops took up their quarters in the college and church, but the enemy fired on us all night. We made a battery by the college, and commenced shelling the town and Palace. We lost most of our men in the town. They advanced too far without support, and were fired at from the wails and houses. Our losses from the 14th to the 20th were 64 officers and 1,380 men killed and wounded. On the 16th we attacked and took the magazine. I went with the column. We took them by surprise, and they offered very very little resitance; but in the afternoon they returned and attacked the magazine, and set the roof on fire. We had to get up on the roof with leathern bags of water and put it out, while they threw large stones at us. They were fanatics, I afterwards heard. I think that day I had the narrowest escape of any. After putting out part of the fire I was just jumping down, when threa of them put their heads over the wall and took three deliberate shots at me, all of which missed. They could not have been above 10 yards off; I fired my revolver at one, but don't know vhether it hit him or not. A sergeant of Artillery then got on the top of the ArtiUlery magazine with 10-inch sheils in his hand; he lighted the fuse and dropped them on their heads; five or sig he let off in this way. It must have kiled a great many, for they fled almost directly. On the 20th, after our pouring into it a tremendous ire of sheUl, we attacked the Palace. There were very few Sepoys found in it, They had all flad during the night. " Thank God it is all over; I am sick of bloodshed and seelng men kilUed. I never felt so much seeing an European killed as a poor privat of Her Majesty's 61st. I was in the magazine with him, making some loopholes of sandbags. He asked me to take a shot at the Sepoys outside with his rifle, and he was looking through the loophole to see the shot when a bullet came through and killed him by my side. Lieutenant Hodson took the King of Delhi prisoner about four miles from here. He is very old, but if it is proved that he aided in the murder of Europeans he wiU not be spared. Fancy, a European was taken who had been fighting on their side all along. He was a sergeant-major in a native infantry regiment, and had turned Mussulman HIe wil doubtless be hung. Three or four hundred of the inhabitarts 'who were suspected to be guilty of the murder of Europeans were shot, but I am glad to say not a woman or ohiUd was touched, for, although they murdered all our ladlies, it is not in the nature of Europeans to klUl women. The two sons and grandsons of the King were kiUled; his son, the heir to the throne, was the man who kiUled some of the Europeans with his own hand. A good deal of plunder, but not so much as was expected, has beon found. There are prize agents, who are supposed to stop plundering, but I don't think they do much. All of it should be divided among the army. I trust we shaU get a medal for DelhL I am sure we have had as hard fighting as we well could, though against mutineers. They say we shaU get six months' or a year's batta, but I don't care much about that if we get, a medaL A column is gone out in pursuit of the fugitives. We get very little news from down country. All the Bengal side and the North West Provinces are still in a ve disturbed state. We wart many European troops out here. Our corps has distinguished itself very much. There are only four Victoria Crosses given, and three are to the EngiB neers-Lieutenants Salkeld and Home and Sergeant Smith; the other is the bugler-and well they deserve it. I only hope poor Salkeld will recover to wear it, but he is in a very dangerous state. I believe we are going to stay here -two or three months. It has been forwarded to the Gover. nor-General to know 'what is to be done with the oity. Many of our sick and wounded are going off to the hills. This is a most unhelthy place; whenever I go out in the town I come back very feverlsh. Most of us are a good deal knoked up by this campaign. I don't know when we al go back, but I shall not be very sorry to get sway from here. I think the beat reglments here are Her laesty's 60th RiEles wad the Goorklias; I don't like the Sikhs much. I was very much disappointed by a speech of lord Melville's about somne officers of our corps at Mooltau taking away treasre. I have heard trora Maunsell, who ws there, that it is entirldy untrue. Some offioer found some treasure, and was taidng it to the prize agent, when he was stopped by the guard. I hope it has been contra. dlcted." MUSSOORIE. The following is from a lady at Mussoorle, dated Sept. 2as- " My darest -,-You will by this time have heard that Delhi is once more in our possession, but the good news cnot give you hal the pleasure that It gave us. ' On the 14th the mault oommenced, and on the 21st the town was completely in our hands. The bloodshed on both sides has been very great, but no official lists have yet been sent up here, though, of course, we have heard the names of most of those killed and wounded. Among the officers Edwsard Hildebrand was the first killed on our side, but I think I told you of his death In my last. We have as yet heard no particulars of the fight, for the letters which have been received up here were only a few lines to say the writers were safe. They bave not much time for writing just now, poor fellowa! We think the rains are nearly over now, which will be a great thing for the troops. Hitherto great numbers have been carried off by cholera, fever, &C.; but directly the rains are over the air begins to freshen, and in October it is very healthy even in the plains. " 2Sth.-To-day the official returns of those killed have reahed us. We have lost 65 officers and 1,163 men. General Wilson has now only 1,500 Europeans left with him. I was sorry to see among the names that of Ensign Gambler, who wrote the account of his escape from Delhi to Meerut which I sent home and desired H - to forward to you. HIe joined the force before Delhi only a few days before the assault. The farst account we heard when the Palace was taken was that the King and Royal family had made their escape to a village a few miles off; but to-day we hear that he has given himself up. I will not vouch for the truth of this. I wonder what will be done with him; people think thero will be no peace while he Is alive and In this country. Three regiments of mutinous Sepoys escaped from the town durlng the assault, and have betaken themselves to Rohilcund. Tney are now at Muzuffernugger, much too near us to be pleasant; they have sent a force from Meerut todislodge them, but we have not yet heard of the result. They (the rebels)are between us and Meerat. Jhope theywill not takeit into their heads to make a rush up here. We have no tidings of the success of Havelock'si march to relieve Lucknow; but all communioation with the Lower Provinces has now been cut off. All our letters go up to I&aore, and then down to Bombay-rather a long way round, as you will see if you look at the map. How fortunate for us that the Punjab has continued quiet ! Sir John LAw. rence, the ohief commissioner, is a most able and energetio man, quite equal to his post. Mr. Colvin, our lieutenant. governor, died lately at Agra. Mr. J. P. Grant is spoken of as his suocessor; his appointment (should it take place) will give great dissatisfaction,' as he is totally unacquainted with the north-west, and a great deal too much of a fine gentleman. It is generally thought that in such times as these, when the north-west is one great battle-field, the governorship should have been given to a military man. Of course I know nothing of all this; I only repeat other people's opinions. A few days ago our people had a brush with some insurgents at a place called Saharanpore, aud I am sorry to say they were beaten off, through the mis. conduct of seome of he Ohoorkas; however, they will be at them again by this time. Saharanpore is close to this-just through the pass a little to the right, and Muzuffernugger just beyond it ; so you see our amiable friends the Pandies are much nearer than they were before. Wo don't want them up here, for our little band is being reduced. Fifteen officers (convalescents) were ordered downto Delhlyesterday. They start on Monday. How they are to get down seems a problem, but I suppose they will make a long d6tour through the hils; the direct road they cannot go. I hope they wiLl all reach safely, but I am very much afraid they will not. " 26th.-We have to-day heard that the two sons of the King and one of his grandsons have been captured and shot, and their bodies have been hung up. The King of Delhi has been paraded, in order to disgrace him. His ultimate fate seems uncertain. He is a very old ma We have heard to-day, too, that when the force fromn Meerut reached Muuzffernugger the rebels had evacuated the place, and not one was to be seen. This is good news for us. To.day, or rather, to-night, the bazaar is illuminated by order of thecommandant, Colonel Lestrange. We passed throught It an hour ago, and ib promised to bo a very pretty sight. A salute of 21 guns was fired, and altogether we are in better spirits. NIEEMUOR. The following is from an oflicer at Neemuch, dated Sept. 23:- " The station from which I write is in the heart of Rajpootana, a country abounding In and surrounded by native States which compose anything but one family, and betwoen any two of which it is very difflicult to determine at any given time what relatlon exists. There are Holkar's troops and Scindia's troops and Salomba's troops, and the mercenary troops of Oodeypore, the Kotah Contingent, the Jeypore, Joudpore, Meywar, and Malwar corps, and a host more, and when any little dispute arises in the country a sort of jumble takes place between these bodies, during which two of them at least are pretty sue to come into collidson. "' We are about 24 miles fromMundissore, a town well known to the readers of British Indian history. In these times of mutiny and revolt against the British flag thistown has taken upon itself to ignore Scindia's authority, and to exalt a flag of its own-the green flag of the Prophet, made use of in these times by those who wish to show their defi. ance of British power. The English malls are stopped at Mundissore and the letters and papers thrown into the river. Mounted pickets are posted on the high road on each side of the town. "The town itself is in course of fortification. All the ragamuffins of the country are gathered there; 13 guns are posted on the walls. Recruits have been made from the mutineers straggling about the country. Heavy bribes are offered to any of our Sepoys to join, and, in fact, the town thinks it is going to have it all its own way. It is plain that, If possible, this state of things must be altered. We must take Mundissore, andhave our post road free. But the force at Neemuch Is small, and Mundissore being inconveniently on the road between this and Mhow, all communication with the troops at that station is stopped, and we cannot at present oombine our forces. To leave Neemuch unprotected would be to leave it to the mercles of some of our friends, more to be dreaded, according to the proverb, than oar enemies, or, for what we know, It might faLl into our enemies' hands. Be that as it may, the Governor-General's agents have a difficult part to play. Scindia wishes to regain Mundissore; SCindia is our ally, but Scind3a and Scindia's troops are two different parties. A combination between these troops and ourselves, it appears, would no' be politic. We must proceed on our own foundation, or not at all; and this we hope to do, by God's help, with success before long. In the meantime the Governor-General's agent for Meywar stationed here sees a stumblingblock In another direction. The town of Nimbhaira stands 16 m3ies distnt on the high road between this and Nuaeoerabad. It Is wallod, and has guns upon its walls. It is garrisonod by a host of troops paid by the Nawab of Tonk, a friend that has proved treacherous In time of need. It is decided that the troops have no business there. They are inimical to the British Government; they dream of Delhi; shortly they will stop the post. Green flags obscure the vision of the agent to the Governor-General. Tonk must be turned out and Odeypore instaUed. In short, the town must be. come a Brltish possession, and the Odoypore troops must garrison it. The Governor-General's agent impresses this point on the Commandant of Neemuch, and a force is prepared. Haer Majesty's 83d detachment afford all they can -70 men; the Bombay 12th Natlve Infantry afford S0, and the 2d Bombay Cavalry 150 men. Two 9-pounders and a mortar accompany the force; 12 Bengal officers from (late) Bengal Regiments are in attendance; and 20 Christians of the 2d Bombay Cavalry and 8 sergeants man the guns, which are horsed and harnessed by the 2d Cavalry. This party leave on the evening of the 19th. Colonel vackson, 2d Bombay TAght Cavalry, commands the force. A short account of the attack upon and capture of the town may not be uninterestlng to our countrymen at home. " The foaee, as above, arrived on their ground at about 9 o'clock a.m, on the morning of the 20th. They halted on the bank of a river which lay between them and the town, at about 700 yards distance from its walls A party first went forward, calling on the town to surrender and deliver upwal arms. The Amf er, or rgpaes ntative of the Tonk Nuwab, cams forth frora the gates and agrted to surtendTa, but begged arn hour's time for the arms to be given up. Slowly a few ragged-lookdng warriors came outside the gates and placed some weapons on the ground; hut it wa5 evldent that, whatever might have been their chief 's ideas, they were loth to give up their means of defence, for an hourpassed,andtheyhadonly givenup a fewgunsand pistols of British make, plunder which had evidently been takon at the late mutiny at Neemuch. One half-hour more was allowed, and then a herald went into the town and pro claimed that if a oomplete surrender of arms were not effected in a quarter of an hour the town should be attacked. The herald was made mincemeat of within the walls, British troops were not to be treated thus; so 'whish' went a shell from our Eide into the midst of the town, and hostilities began. The cavalry hemmed the enemy ln at the gates. The 9-pounders were drawn up wlthin 500 yards of the town, the infantry within 100 yards, whence they commenced a ratling fire at all heads that appeared above the walls, and now there was warm work on both sides. The enemy returned our fre well, but were careful In concealing their persons The fire of musketry and matehlocks through the loopholes was tremendous, but aim appeared to be a thing of little Import. anee, or our loss would have been sovere. From half-past 1 to half-past 5 this work was continued, but the stubborn gates remained firm, aud little or no impression was made upon the walls, Then the gun advanced trngugh deep mud under a galling fire to within about 100 yards of the walls, where our infantry had been keeping up a continued fire of musketry from the beginning of the fight. " Our plan now was to blow up the gates, make a breach, if possible, in the walls, and take the town by assault with the whole of the infantry, and a party of dismounted Bombay cavalry, the party to be led by Colonel Jackson, commanding the force. Everything was in preparation, Ser. geant Taylor had the bag of powder on his shoulder to blow up the gate, and was ready for a run. Her Majesty's 83d had been told off as coolly and steadily as if for parade, and every one was worked up into the highest pitch of eagerness and excitement, when, lo I our hopes were doomed to be disappointed, the order was pased that, evening coming on, the troops were to retire, and most slowly and n- willingly- theT fell baok. Nothing could exceed the bravery of all the troops ; the 12th Native Infantry, firm as a rook, caring nothing for the balls that flew like hallstones around them, were only eager that our own 83d,who, of course, behaved as British soldiers do, should not be before them on the walls. In the action one corporal of the 83d 'was kiled within 30 years of the fort. Dr. Miles, 83d Foot, was severely wounded, and an officer, Mr. Charles Burton, of the Officers' Volunteer Corps, was slightly wounded; 50 of the cavalry had volunteered their services to dismount and join in the assault, and one jemadar (or native subaltern officer), who was bravely advancing to the walls,was shot through the lver, and now lies In a dangerous state; 17 men of all ranks were wounded. The troops when they went out of action had tasted no food since the day before, and now they were too tired to eat; they slept on the damp ground on which the rain had fallen heavily that day, with no tent or coverlng of any sort over them. The gallantry of the native troops on this occasion afforded us, their offioers, peculiar gratification, as the previous mutinous behaviour of some of the men, all of whom we hope are captured now, or have fled not to return, had cast a stigma on the two corps as a body, which we were only too glad to see their bravery and loyalty this day wipe out. '1 In the morning the commandant of the force received intelligence that our brave enemy had deserted the fort,-a contingency we could hardly have prevented with our small force, and mud up to the horses' knees all round the fort. The end seems a poor one after the high hopes that had been entertained by the force, and considering the facUity with which, with another hour's daylight on the previous evening, they might have triumphantly stormed and cut their way into the town, and many were the lamentations among the British soldiers that they had been robbed of a chance of avenging the horrible murders of their countrymen and countrywomen. Any native is fair game to a British soldier now; he takes him as the representative of the Bengal Sepoy as a race. But our political point was gained. The troops walked quietly In, the British flag was erected on the principal building, and Nimbhaira and the territory of which it is the principal town is now British property, to yield the Government a revenue of 2,0001. per annum. The indivi. dual who out up our herald or messenger Into little pieces has been captured and blown away from a gun." JUBBXULPORE. The following is from Jubbulpore, dated October 9: "We are still at Jubbulpore, you see, and I do not see much prospect of our being able to get away in a hurry, as it is rather dangerous to go along the road without an escort, and I am not likely to get one at present. My last would tell you of the mutiny of the 52d-how one detachment of the regiment allowed two officers to escape, while another had made a prisoner of poor 'Gregor; and how the two companies, with the Eamptee column, had been quietly disarmed, that Dumoh had been abandoned, and the column was on its march back to Jubbulpore. On the 26th the column was at Singram pore. The next morning the column was to march to Kuttingee (10 miles) at daylight, but at 2 o'clock a,m. the GrenadLer company of the 33d, under Lieutenant Watson, started with the intention of securing the boats on the Heron River. Major Jenkins, Quartermaster-General, went with Watson. After riding about three miles they had got about 200 yards in front of the company. Suddenly a bugle in front of them sounded the fire; 'snick, snlck' went some muskets, then a regular volley. 'Holloa,' said Jenklns, ' here we are in the midst of them.' Dark though It was, they could see they were smurounded by Sepoys; they were the rebel 52d advancing to attack the Kamptee column. One Sepoy stepped close up to Watson and fired in his face; the ball only gave him a gash under the eye. He rode the man down, but he himself fell in doing so. He regained his feet, but fell again and again. Somehow he managed to catch hold of Jenkins's stirrup, and ran on; his horse trotted up to him, and he contrivod to mount. Both then cantered on, but immediately came on the rear guard. 'Halt, who comes there? called out the leading fle. They gave no reply, but dashed through unhurt, though exposed to the fire of the whole guard, Was it not a wonderful escpe? Jon. kins's horse had two balls in him, and Watson's boy, carrying his rifle, was shot dead; they hid In the jungle till the column came up in the forenoon; they were re. celved with shouts and cheers, for every one thought them kfiled. The mutineers had no bayonets fixed. The Grena. dier company fell back on the column In good order, whlch, being warned of the state of affairs, advanced at daylight and soon came in sight of the mutineers, advancing steadily along the road in columnn of sections; when within 300 yards of them our gus were unrmasked, but just aa they opened fire the mutineers wheeled back-wards right and left, and got into the jungle, which was very thick, and came quite close to the road. It is blie-ved that in the course of the morning the mutineers lost about 120 rmen; there were many hundred Bundelahs with them. OurlosVwas trifling; afew men wounded and a trumpeter kiled. On coming near Kuttingee the body of poor M'Gregor was found, plerced with eight or nine bayonet wounds, a shot in the neclk, his arm gashed and br oken; we were all grieved to hear of his sad fate ; his body was brought in here and burled the next day at noon. A wounded havlldar and S epoy were taken prisoners at Kuttingee and hung on the spot. After the column moved onthe mutineers returned, cut down the bodies, and buried them with military honours ! The column came In here on the 1st, and Colonel Mill assumed command of the station. We intended to have left this on the 7th, but on the 5th the road was allowed to be unsafe; it has been unsafe any day for the last three months ! Bergee, 15 miles from this on the high road to Kamptee, was burnt by rebels. On the 27th or 28th a large kafla was plundered at the Silwa Ghaut, five miles further on. Sixteen mutineers of the 52d were at Bergee on the 4th; they out off the noses of some Bunyahs who had gone to buy ghee, and one of thom, known to be the princlpal In the murder of poor M1'Gregor, sent a message to Captain Moxon, 52d; they hoped to serve him the same way ; he had offer ed 200 rupees for the colours; they had intended to collect a party and attack Jubbulpore; that they would bring the colours with them, and he might then take them if he could ! Yesterday morning a party from this were sent to cle ar the road of the villalss; and as Cunaberlege, with the 4th Cavalry, en route here, was only three miles beyond Bergee it was hoped that the rebels might be captured or done for. I hear to-day that the expedition was unsuccessful; It is said tha' the rebels have retired to a hill like a natural fortress. I imagine some effort willbe made to dislodge them, as the infantry have not returned and the cavalry are stiU on the other aide of the river. Gunnesgunge, another place on the road, is also occupled by rebelsa-Gonds, I believe. The main body of the mutinous 52d are gone up the Mirzspore.road; we heard of them at Sehora (25 miles from this) two days ago. Our Calcutta da h as been interrupted for two or three days, but is now open, so I dare say the mutineers have left the high road. The officers of the 50th B. N. I. with 250 stanch men, have arrived at Allahabad insafety. Three Sepoys of the52d have been captured, brought in here, and hanged, and five Bundelahs were turned off two days ago. These affairs are taken as a matter of course. The capture of Delhi you would hear of by the las mall, but our communications are so interrupted that up to this time we have no details. Lucknow has bees relieved; our loss was great, and all Madras officers will, I am sure, lament the death of General NeiU In the attack. Barely half the garrison survive, but all this you -wil get better detailed inthe papers." NYI-EE TAL. Many persona in England beng interesed in the f.ate of friends at Eyne Tal, the following account o£ a slight fidrmish in the 18th of September may be aceceptable:.- "Bahadoor lihan, formerly a deputy collector in our service, but of lato self-oonstituted Nawab of Bareill, recenUtly despatched a body of 800 men, under command of his nephew, Nizam Talle lhan, towards Nynee Tal. To meet these 300 Ghoorkas of the 66th Native Infantry, with 23 officers and troopers of the late 8th Irregulars, and about 30 mounted 'mutinied-out' offioers were despatched. "The insurgents were at first only allowed to see the cavalry, and seemed inclined to showv 5ght, but theGhoorkas coming up at the ' double' the insrgents broke and fled, pm-sued by tie cavalry for a ditnce of four or five miles. 50 of the insurgents were killed, and among othes their ditinguished leader, Nizasm Ullie, upon whose persoA papers were found giving the names of the different chiefe in the neighbourhood wvho had joined in the Insurrection, " Our casualties appear to have been but few if any." The following extract from a letter received from Nynee Tal may afford some slight satisfacton to the friends of any of the officers of the 18th Bengv1 Native Infautry ;- !1 About dearest - we aro In J iAa *tq of unoortalnqt and anxiety, but our hopes have lately been much revived by the disoovery of one of the officers of his regiment (tho 18th), Lieutenant Gowan, the adjutant, who was one of the miEsing, a servant of his having found him concealed In some village. He sent a letter by him to Colonel - at Nlynee Tal, glving an account of his escape, and how he got separated from the rest of the party after the few well-disposed Sepoys bad saved them on the day of the outbreak. He had gone through a great deal, but expresses himself very thankful for the protection and kindness he had received from some Hindoos, by whom he was stlm secreted. He had heard that several Europeans wre In concealment in different villages, which native spies and others who are friendly towr-ds the English also confirm, and sy that a banker at Bareily has secretly supplied them with money; but whrile the wretched Ehan, Bahadoor Ehan, who has set himslf up As the ruler or Nawa,b of Rohllound, is in power they aro unable to assit the escape of the poor fugitives, and will not allow any strangera to approach their village for fear of their being discovered by the bloodthirsty surper; therefore It has not been possible to learn the namos or obtain the signatures of these poor fellows, and we must only endeavour to wait patiently, putting our trust In the good and graclous God that He will in His own good time restore the sufferers to their heartbroken wives and friends." MURREE. The following Is from Murree, dated September 14:- "We have a tale to teU of danger near us, which It hai please God to avert for the present. It Is the reason of my being up here. Our general weakness in the Ptmjabwas found out by thes mountaineors, and general plans for plundering Murree and throwing off our yoke wvere strted. But the Population immediately round Murree precipitated matters and ssaulted on the lzt inst., before the country was ready. These men were promised an easy victory by ,ome villanous Hindoatanees in the cantonment, who offered to use, in favour of the insurgents, the great opportunities they had for mutdering the English. A woman, wife of the head of a village,however, sent word in the evening of the las of September to a man of Lady LAwrencoes guard, to whose son her own daughter wasbetrothed. Her husband wasone of the rebelr, and knew not of her act. The Intelligence, though verbal, was believed. The 200 European soldiers and 200 Puna'bee soldiers, who formed the sole defence of the place, were called out. The gentlemen were armed a, volunteers, pickets were posted, and when the ssault began at 2 am. on the 2d the insurgents were warmly met and repulsed from the first picket. This checked the country generally from joining. Those who had committed themselves were attacked and dispersed on the 3d, havIng been driven out of a strong positlon they took up. I came up on the night of the 3d with renforcements, and since then we have been punishing those actually committed and quieting the mountains generally-not being stiong enough to take a very high Lne. The ladies behaved well, and the men excelleuntly. The volunteers elected their leader, and senior officers served cheerfully under him, their junior. There is danger, but, with God's blessing, we may hope to avert any more open revolt by vigilance and judgment. The fall of Delhi, if granted to us, will remove many difficulties."

YOtNG MX 's CHRISTmor AssocArTiOx.-The 13th annual course of lectures to young men was inaugurated last night at Exeter-hall. The building was filled in every part, and on the platform were the Earl of Harrowby, Mr. Baxter, MYP., Mr. Kinnaird, MLP., Archdeacon Philpots, and several other gentlemen Interested in the progress of the association. After some introductory observations from the Earl of Harrowby, who was in the chair, Mr. Baxter, M.P., proceeded to deliver an address on the social influence of Christianity. He believed that the time had arrived when missionary enterprlse would take a new impetus, and that the nation and the Legislatura were arriving at a true sense of the responsibility which attached to them In this respect. Inone sensenocountryunderthesunwasmorefavour ably situatedfor realizlng the effects of Christianity than our own. For upwards of 100 years we had enjoyed the blessings ofnational peace. No civ warhaddesolatedourfields; no foreign foe had shaken our prestige, while incipient empires at the antipodes had adopted our religion, our language, and our laws; and yet, had it not 'een for Christianity, this empire might have been barbarous as Madagascar, or unknown as Th'bet and Japan. The refined cruelties and unparalleled barbarities reoently commltted in the NorthWest Provinces of India upon women and children were such as exceeded in horror the atroeities committed by Calgula or Nero, or perpettrated by wild beasts on Christian martyrs in the Co am. Yet no one 'who had studied the pecullarities of the Mahomedan and llndoo faith could be surprised at the hideous crimes which had been committed in Delhi and Cawnpore. Se wa thoroughly persuaded that no mere amount of modern clvilization would suffice for the government of infidel kIngdoms. We might cover India with a network of rallways, irrigate her deserts, reclaim her jungles, reform her courts of justice, and make it a model of successful government, but If we did not Christianize the people we should stil be liable to the outrages and rebellions of miscreants like Nana Sahib. He was persuaded that if we attempted1 to govern India without asserting our reli. gious creed we should fail, while if we once established our faith we should lay the foundations of a kingdom as enduling as the Himalays. The apathy which we hAd exhibited towards India-a policy semi-atheist and semi-infidel-led the natives of India to believe that we were ashamed of our relWion. We had 200,000,000 of natives committed to our charge, and yet we had arcely bestovwed a thought upon their moral condition. It might be that for this criminalapathy God had sent the destroying angel into many of our homes. While he would not for a moment recommend persecation on account of religion, he would ask whether Great Britain was pre to govern India on the prindple of abnegating the Christian faith ? The hon. gentleman concluded his address amid loud and general cheers. THE OvERLAD MAn.-It appea that the time occupied in the transon of the CAlcutt mail from Pauis to London on Saturday last was less than stated In he 2'imne of yesterday. The train left Pais at 5.50 Sm., and arrived in London at 2.56 p.m., the page from one capital to the other having been performed Jn nine hours sIx minutes. On the 28th nlt. the time occupied In conveylng the Bombay mal from Paris to London wa eight hours 54 minutes; but on that oooadon the French railway train ran to Boulogne (169 miles) in ten minutes less time and the South-.Estern Railway train ran up to London (88k miles) in 17 minutes lees time; but the steam packet wvas lon1r on the passage (30 statute miles) on the 28th ultthan on ;>aturday last. ad the railways, therefore, run at the same speed on Saturday as on the 28th of October, the time ecopled in erforming the journey between Paris and London would have been eight henrs 89 minutes, wvhich, as stated xesterday, wvould have been the qulskeot thminsi Xcll 0 Pehaa over beea made,
THE MRARAJAXH SC0NDIAH. The following is the state of affairs in Gwallor, as furnished by a wrter (Native Christian) residing there:- 41SEP 8. "Everything here is pretty quiet at present, and I trust it ma continue so. For the lsstthrte or four days owe hae been lahbouring under great fear on aoeount of the troops or rather mutineers, that had come from Indore separat ing from tho Gwalior Contingent mnutlneers, with whom they had been encamped since their arrival here, a dispute having arieen between them u to the route they were In future to take, the fonmer wishing to proosed to Delhi, while the latter wished to proceed to CAwRpore. The Indorlans marched on the 3d, and encamped at the Red. dency. They encamped two days, during which time they managed to get some 600 men from the two cavalry corps in the Maharajah's service to join them; the remaining two irregularcavalry regiments consisted chiefly of Mahomedan. A number of the scoundrels walked off with horses belong. ing to other Sowars, and one scoundrel decamped with a horse belonging to the captain of his regiment. The lMaharajah was, at the same time, well prepared to put down any disturbancel that might arise, but everything went off well; all the Sowars that voluntarily came out and asked for their discharge were immediately paid up sand sent out of Gwallor, while a great por. tion went away without tidng their discharge, s they were deeply in debt, and the Ma3 1aj had already ordered the effects of all those who were noL able to pay up their debts to be sold and the debts paid. Although the Mooraur mutineers were not unanimous as to their future route, the Mooraurians, to prove their loyalty, supplfed the Indorlans with a good quantity of ammunition before parting. " The Indore troops oonsisted of one Reginent of Native Infantry (the 23d Company's), three troops 1st IAght Cavalry, 7 guns, and 600 Sowar3 from the Maharajah's servnce; the ammunition they received wwa powder 2,4001b., shot of all sorts 3,000, and ball cartridges sufficient to supply each man with 30 rounds. Some of the Budmasbhe from the city of Gwdlior have also joined. The whole of the scoundrels left this on the morningof the 5th. The mutineers now at Mooraur are also talking about making a move, and have applied to his HIghness for oonveyance; no one yet knows properly where they go to; they talk of going to Cawnpore and some say to Agra. " Yesterday, the 7th, the native officers from the several mutineers' regiments of.the Gwallor Contingent came in a body, with about 200 Sepoys, to the Pool Baugh, to demand grain, conveyance, &o., from the Maharajah, to enable them to march upon Agra or Cawnpore. The native officers only were called In; they have all along attended the Maharajab's Darbar with their sde arms, but now that they came in a body his Highness partioularly requested them to lay down their arms at the gate before entering. The mutineers' officers did so, but a lot of Sepoys also accompanied them. The DIxrbar was held in the biliard and school rooms, which was full of Sepoys. However, the officers told the Maharajah that all their Sepoys were desirous of marching upon Agra, and that they hoped hislighness wouldrendatrneandcithfulseantin company with them, as also supply them with grain and conveyances to Agra,as they were, and would always be, servants to his Highneoss. The Maharajah plainly told them thAt if they considered themselves servants of his, they were to remain where they were, and to obey only such orders as he was pleased to command; and that when they were required to march, it would be he that would issue the orders, and not at theiroption; but if theydidnotwishto obeyhisorders they were at liberty to do as they liked; that he (the Maharajah) would neither eupply them with gran, conveyance, nor anything else. This was enough. One or two of the scoundrels began to be very insulting, telling the Maharajah that he had detained them nearly four months with false promises andthat-he had consequently entirely deceived them; that they would have conveyances from wherever they came. Accordingly they sent then and there three Sepoys-armed, of course-to the villages close by, and have brought away every bullock, buffalo, male or female, mules, asses, horses, carts, camels, and, in fact, anything in the shape of conveyance for baggage. Every bullock that they could lay their hands on around Gwalior has been seized, three elephants belonging to different chiefs have been taken away, and a number of camels. BuUocks grazing close to the Pool Baugh have been seized and taken away; five companies with two guns were sent out yesterday, some 10 or 12 miles into the country, to seize upon every conveyance they could find, and get hold of other plunder, clean sweeping every village. A tussle Is very nearly, nay hourly, expected. From the evening of the 7th the Mooraurian s have had a battery of 12 guns planted on the road to the Pool Baugh and the Luchkur, with a regiment of infantry always in readiness. The Maharajah has also a battery of 16 guns facing theirs, with infantry and cavalry, but nothing further has taken place. It is believed the Maharajah's infautrf are stanch, as they have shown no sign of disaffection. On the evening of the 7th the lMaharajah came in person and ordered out all his Infantry. After calling the roll he told them that the day had come when they were required to do their duty as soldiers, and to earn the ' salt' they had been eating for the inst 14 years at least; to which they one and all an. swered that they were ready to forfeit their lives for him, wherever and against whomever he may command, which very much pleased the Maharajah. He told them that he would handsomely recompense them should they stick to their words. " Independent of his troops, the Maharajah has about 10,000 of his brave Thakoors; such as Murleydhur, Buld. awe Sing, with others, protecting Gwallor all round; about 4,000 or 5,000 remain opposite the Pool Baugh every night. ever matchslooklit and ready. The city people here re. main in suspense all night ; every hour we expect to hear the report of cannon. Should the city be plundered, there is faint hope for the poor Christians. I only hope the Maharajah wilU supply them with the conveyance they require, and let them go out of this; but the Maharajah will not submit, and so we must only wait to see the result. News came in yesterday that the Indore mutiteers have safely crossed the Chumbull River, and taken possession of the Fort of Dholpore. The Rana has shifted quarters. So you see we are not altogether safe, but Providence I trust will protect us. It was firmly believed that the Mooraurians would open fire at 12 o'clock to-day, on the Maharajah's batteries, but they havrenot done so; It is now 3 p.m. I think some arrangements have been made respecting the conveyance they require. " SEPT. 9. "On going to the Pool Baugh I found things quite in a different way. The Mooraurians have advanced their battery closer to the Pool Baugh. I went on a three-storied house to have a look, and there, sure enough, the scoundrels could be seen I There were two batteries of sx guns eacb, with six companies protecting each battery. 2so terms having been concluded, they sent word that by 3 this morning, should nothing be concluded they willpositively open fire. Our brave 3aharajah ordered out every available soldier and every gun he is possessed of -viz., one horse and five budock batteries, one large 36-pounder, four regiments of infantry, the Affghan troops, &c., twvo regiments of cavalry. They were all planted over the plain for nearly four or five miles on the right and lef t of the Mooraur, the Mahasraiah going all over his batteries, and causing it to be told to every Sepoy that he will raise their pay from this day, and will handsomely reward them if£they do their duty; al shouted ' Jo-hooku-m Alleeja Bahadoor Ka.' About 12 o'clock last night matters were concluded, the Maharajah agreeing to supply them with conveyance ,nd to pay the scoundrels one month's pay. This morning they have withdrawn their batteries, but the Maharajah's battery is still on its ground, as there is no dependence to be placed on the vagabonds. So no more for the present, Until such time as the scoundrels do actually march away there will be no peace. "SEP-T. 1I. "No settlement has been come to. The troops and guns are still out. The Maharajah has advanced his batteries to within a couple of musket shots from the Mooraurians. A considerable numberof men on the Maharajah's sideareoutin the field, the matineers are quite thunderstruck to see tho Maharajah bring out such a large number of men against them and within so short a time, as upwards of seven miles the troops (Pindarees and Thakoors) extend on the right and left of the cantonment of Moorar. The scoundrels are completely hemmed in on all sides, and, what is worse with them, they have no sowas or cavalry, the whole of their cavalry having previously deserted them and come over to the Maharajah. The 5th Regiment and a company of the 6th have also come to the Maharajah, so that there are not many of the scoundrels-say about 5,000-now at Moorar. Since the night of the 8th and 9th about 120 of the villains have come to the Maharajal, and thls morning 40 are waiting at the Dewan Sahib's house, and as many have absconded; all that come to the Maharajah are ordered to be kept separately from his troops; they are not even allowed to associate with the ahsrajah's Sepoys, but are kept safe and seCure fxr apart, and as soon as matters are settled thoroughly with the mutineers they will then be dealt with as his Highness may think proper. " It is also rumoured that they have sent men to Dhola. pore to ask the Indorians to come back to their assistance, but It is not likely that they will do sO, since they wgre made to pay for the ammunition they were supplied with, to say nothing of the trouble and expense they will have to incur in returning; they are deserting every day, and cannot hold out mach longer, " Mre more in feat of the city budmahes than the imutineera, should a quarrel occur. Now, I have given ycl all the news I could get up to thl day; what will next occar I will collect for a fature letter; tillthen, adieu I SEPT. 12. I give you tho latest news jest come In; only two com. panles of infantry and one troop of cavary, with two guns have crossed theriverChumbcL The mutineers At Mooraur have withdrawn one of their batteries, but they send urgent nessages for food and conveyanoes. I think they. will submit. -Nothing occrroed all day and night of the 11th. " SEPT. 14. "The mutineers at Mooraur have withdrawn the whole of their heavy gans but their light guns are kept out Al picket guns. The Mahraiah's troops and gunS are xWl out, ho says that he will not withdraw his guns and froops until such time as the whole of them have marched away. The 6th Regiment and the remaining two comPenles of the 6th Reglment, with the two guns in their poeeson, have tken servioe with his Highness. AocordIngly, they have removed into the llnes in the Kumpoo; the two guns with two companies are out with the Mbarajahs toops, ready to give the Moorauriaus a lieldng should they attempt to up kick a disturbance. There are now at Mooraur three regiments of Infantry and five companies of artlery, in all about 3,000 men. They have Dromised to leave within six days The Maharajah has sent them plenty of ooxveyance, but they still require more. TheIndoremutine rsappe rtoe o iat the Chumbul, but the Cossid will be able to give you ipticulars on. that subject. The mutineers from oorar talk of going Vi4 Agra to Delhi, but they have no pluck, 400 or o00 }uro pens would suffie to beat them and take away ever? muet and gun they possess. I don't think they wRi be able to ta}e away all his ammunition. They sy they will destroy what they cannot take awray. " SEPr. 25. 5A native letter from Gwalior says:_ 'The Mahamiah, having assembled a considerable number of his ryota, surrounded the mutinous troops there on all sides, and asked them either to fight or givo up their arms. On which the mutineers, seenlg no other alternative, lid down their ars and quietly left the Gwalior territory, and are now on their way to their homes.' "Captain Dennys, Lieutenants Benyon and Bannerman, late of theKotka Contingent, have joined Brigadier.General Iawrnce's camp at Beawr, who has a troop of Horse Artil. lery, about 250 of Her Majes's 83d Regiment, two sauad. rons of the Ist IAncers, and 200 of the .lhairwarrah locd battallon, to meet the Erinpoora mutinoers, who are sid to be in afort at Soojut called Awah; the mutineers are sai to have seven guns, and 1,000 picked men."
GREAT BoAT RAcE.-One of the most spirited boat races on record was roweed yesterday between Thomas Cannon, of Wapping, and Alfred Ralph, of Wandsworth, both men of very considerable pretension as soullers, although differing very materiall In their style. The antagon of above and below bridge, as wet and east of London-bridge, are termed, rendered thin race one of more than ordinary interest, and the friends of the parties speculated their money very freely upon the result. The repeated pertormances of Ralph at the Royal Thames National Regatta, and the prowem exhibie bd Cannon i vanous private engagements, had given promis of a good race' between them, wrhich was reauzed to the very letter, ag the men with varied and trifling leads rowed a mile and a-half with victory hanging In the balance, and the triumph at last achleved was that of superior strength. The race 'wa for 601., and the distance from Putney to Mortlake. The extreme fineness of the weather brought out a vast number of spectators to witness the event, who were highly gratified. Cannon had the best station on the MIddlesex side, and the men started themselves very evenly, in which posltion they rowed to the Duke's Read, where Ralph, by most extraordinary rowing, drew his sitting thwart level with the nose of his opponents boat, where he continued only for a few pulls, Cannon again becoming nearly level, and looking as thongh he were going by him. Both pulled very gallantly, Ralph forcing a slight lead again, but being unable to retain It, and so they continued by Craven Cottage, Ralph ever and anon putting on a spurt which gave him a lead of a few feet, hut he was unequal to the ta6k of keeping pace with the apparently ontiring power of Cannon, who in making the ashoot to Hammers8mith-bridge gradually went away from his opponent, and beat REdph by more than a dozen lengths. Betting was even. MysiEaIous OCCURRENCE.-On Sunday, between 2 and 3 o'clock, two gentlemen named Merrick, who hid been walking on the North Wall, sat down to rest, when one of them observed a parcel concealed between two stones, with a flat stone placed on the top of it, obviously for the purpoee of further concealmekt. He removed the parcel. and found that it was neatly made up in brown ar, ani tied with thin cord. Thinking that it contained the body of a new-born infant, he sent a messenger for the sergeant of the Clontarf constabulary saation, and replaced the parcel in the poition in which he had found it. Sergeant Mullialf, of the Clontarf station, lost rio time in coming to the place, and on opening the parcel found that it contained two weft vests of a superior quality, apparently spotted with blood. They appeared. to have been cut up the back with some sharp instrument, aa the edges of the portion that had been out were not in the least uneven or jagged, anditseemedas if the personwho had last worn them had put them on one over the other. The parce also contained the inserted front of a dress shirt finely plted, a pair of wristbanda, to which were attached about six inches of the sleeves, and the ends of the body of a shirt. These portions were evidently cut from the garmentto which they had belonged, and not torn off. The inserted shirt front bore several marks of blood, or something strongly resembling It, which looked as if they had been attempted to be effaced. The stud holes were torn as if the studs had been violently pulled out. A white Indian silk neckerchief was found in the parcel, with a piece cut out of Its centre, and around the hole were dark red stains, which had been subjected to much rubbing and friction, as that particular part was all frayed and wrinkled. It is appre- ended that the artleles found in the parcel constitute portions of the dress of some respectable person who has been foully dealt with, and that other fragments of his clothing have been concealed elsewhere or destroyed. The circnmstances of this seemingly mysterious case have been forwarded to the proper authorities, who, no doubt, wiL instituto the necessary inquiries into them.-Dublin Fros- FoRizGN FEmALE SLAVERY IN ENGL.A2ND.-Peter Rumph, a German, was charged at the Wakefield Pollce Court on Monday with assaulting a girl named Marguerette Hoyler, also a native of Germany. The evidence which was elicited disclosed the system of bad usage to which Itinerant musicians are subjected by their masters. About six months ago Rumph had brought the complainant over from Germany, where sbe was "bound" to him for three years, for the purpose of playing a piano about the streets, with the understanding that she was to receive 121, at the expiration of her apprenticeship, he in the meantime undertaking to provide her with food and clothing. It now appeared that the food consisted of two meals a day-a miserable breakfast at 7 o'clock in the morning and a like meal when the girl came home at 12 o'clock at night. The latter meal, however, was dependent on the girl bringing enough of money home to satisfy the cupidity of her employer. If this was not the case he was in the habit of savagely beating her. On the 6th of the present month the girl stated that she went home, and, her master not being Satisfied with her day's earnings, he attacked her in a furious manner, knocked her down, kicked her, striped her of her clothes, shoes, and stockigDs, and, taking a knife, said he would kIll her. He wan ill-using her for nearly two hours, when he turned her into the street almost in a state of nudity. The complainant went to another girl whom the defendant had brought from Germany, but who had left him in consequence of the brutality of his conduct, and from whom she obtained some clothes. There were other young women incourt who hadbeen bound to Rumph, and who gave evidence as to the cruelty of his disposition, and also stated that they had never received one halfpenny of the 121. with which he had pretended they should be remunerated. The Bench told the defendant tbat that sort of thing might do in Germany, but It would not do in England, snd fined him 1Z., or in default to be committed for a month to the House of Correction.-Manchcsttr Guardian. TEM HOP DuTy.-We are indebted to our indeftigable member, Mr. G. Dodson, for a copy of the answer to the memorial of the hop planters, presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Friday.

FORBIGN INTBLLIGBNOE. -FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRBSPONDENT.) (A portion of the following appearea in our seoond edition nf vpE.A - . I PARIS, XoNDAnY, NOv. 16, 6 p.M. The Ministerial crisis, if indeed the choice of a person for the offices of MInister of Justice deserves the name, is over. M. de Royer, Procurear-Gdn& ral at the Court of Cassation, is the person the Emperor has selected to take the place of the late M. Abbatucci. I have noticed the various rumoura that circulated from the moment M. Abbatucci's malady assumed a serious character till the present as to the candidates put forward by the public for that post. Among others the name of AL Billault was partioularly mentioned. MI. BiLlault, it was said-and I believe with truth-would, if he could indulge his own tastes, prefer the comparative quiet of the Keeper of the Great Seal to the laborious and often vexatious duties of the Interior, where he is. The business of the lIome Department is of the most important kind; the responsibility is terhaps the greatest of any of the high offices of overnmment, and the Minister at its bead is answerable for the tranquillity of France. These functions require considerable judgment, experience, and tact, aud oa certain occasions great hirmness. The Emperor was, I believe, aware of M. Billault's wish to go to the Department of Justice. It must, therefore be regarded as a compliment to his Minister that Ais Majesty refused his sanction to the change, and, requested, as it is said has been done, hL Billaultto remain Minister of the Interior. MI. Billault has no alternative but to comply. An Tmperial decree nominates the members of the Chambre des MiseB en Accusation of the High Court of Justice for the judicial year 1857-1858. Another decree makes sundry promotions and appointments ii.the higher ranks of the magistracy. The Turkish Ambassador, Mehemed Djemil Bey, had a long interview to-day with the Minister of Foreign Affairs-it was said to present a note from his Government. Count Olsonfief, one of the Emperor of ]Russia's Privy Councillors, and attached to the Foreign De. partment at St. Petersburg, has arrived in Paris on a private mission. The fete-day of the Empress taking place on Sunday, the bands of the National Guard of Compi6gne, of the 2d Regiment of Yoltigeurs, and of the 2d Cuirassiers of the Imperial Guard assembled at an early hour in the morning and played a salute under the windows of Her Majesty. At 1 o'clock the Emperor, followed by General Rolin, Adjutant-General of the Palace; General Count de Montebello, one of his Aides-de-Camp; Captain de Cadore, one of his orderly officers; and Baron Bourgoing, Equerry, mounted on horsebacir, and reviewed the troops of the garrison in the park of the Palace. The Empress and the Prince Imperial, surrounded by the officers and ladies of their household, and all the persons now on a viit at the Palace, were at the windows of the State apartments during the review and the filing off of the troops, whioh took place amid loud cries of " Five l'Bmapereur P' "rive l'nmp'ratrice " " Vive le Prince fmpraZ!" At 9 o'clock in the evening a display of fireworks, organized by the authorities, and at the expense of the town, took place in the park. In the course of the afternoon Her Majesty sent a sum of 2,000f. to the Mayor to be distributed to the poor. Other donations had previously been sent by the Emperor to the different hospitals and charitable institutions of the towvn. A private letter from Madrid, of the 12th inst., mentions that the Government had just received a telegraphic message from the Captain-General of Catalonia announcing the discovery of a conspiracy among the Absolutist party. It was added that the Captain-General (Zapatero) had by that time very probably shot some of the principal persons implicated in this new attempt at insurrection. There exists, it seems, in Catalonia a religio-political association, under the name of Confraternity of San Isidro, and to which no less than 20,000 persons of every age and class are afflliated. The association is Absolutist and Montemolinist. The increase in the rate of discount by the Bank of France has been productive of considerable inconvenience among commercia people, and several commission houses have ceased to transact business under the pressure of the crisis. This again has caused a good deal of embarrassment in the manufacturing districts, but I do not find that failures to much extent are at present apprehended. Much caution has been observed since the commencement of the crisis, otherwise many of them must have given way. These facts probably account for the great diminution in the amount of the commercial bills held by the Bank of France which appears in the monthly account, as published in the Moniteur of Friday. A most inconvenient result of the high rate of discount at the Bank is, that purchasers who have hitherto paid cash to the manufacturers on a reduction of 3 per cent. discount now refuLse to accept less than 10 per cent., which naturally has a corresponding effect on the profits of the sellers. When forced to submit to these hard conditions in order to meet their engagements, they declare they are selling at a loss. The retail dealers also complain tihat their receipts were never so low at this season of the year. Many of their btest customers iind their incomes so mueh reduced by the fall in the value of produce and securities of almost every description, that they limit their expenditure to what is strictly necessary. In the regular progress of reaction the pressure has extended to the labouring classes, at least if we may judge by the crowds that visit the establishments every day. The accounts from the commercial towns in the provinces are not more favourble. A letter from Lyons says that, although a few large orders were received there last week, trade is dull, and, what is worse, no improvement worth speaking of is expected there for some time to come. Thrown silk from Piedmont is quoted at Lyons as follows :-Nos. 22 and 23 from 98f. to 102f. the kilogramme; Italian raw silk from 85f. to 90f. ; Chinese ditto from 48f. to 63f. The distress is so general among the working population of Lyons, that Cardinal de Bonald, Archbishop of that diocess, has addressed a letter to the clergy under his jurisdiction, recommending that a collection should be made in their respective parishes in aid of the silk weavers, who are suffering principally from the crisis. Accounts from Clermont, in the Puy de Dome, are to the effect that the last great fair in that town was not so good as usual. Linens were sold at a considerable reduction as compared with prices obtained in August last. Hides of all kinds, particularly calf skins, fell from 20 to 30 per cent. Wheat had fallen from 50 to 60 centimes since the previous mnarket. Cattleof all descriptions and horses were sold at a reduction. The weather, unusually warm and even sultry at this season, which nearly to the present date has prevailed in parts of the south of France, was beginning to produce decomposition in the potatoes and other vegetables housed since the last harvest. In the nelghbourhood of Bayonne, for instance, it was found necessary to adopt unusual precautions to preserve the beetroot fromz complete destruction. The progressive fall in the price of corn in the Paris market has been checked by the Imperial decree permitting the export of grain. Flour of the first quality rose onWednesday Bf. the sack of 157 kilogrammes; on Saturday sales were more difficult. The factors returned on that day 1,933 sacks of flour, of which 387 were for immediate delivery at prices varying from 47f. to 55f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The reserve of flour in the market stores had diminished by 175 quintals, and remained at 7,502. There was no variation in wheat at the Halle on Saturday. Rye kept up at from I gf. to 20f. the 115 kilogrammes for the best quality and 18f. for inferior samples. Oats also were in demand at 32f. and 33f. the 150 kilogrammes. Advices by telegraph from the principal provincial corn markets give the prices of Saturday last:- "Arras.-Market well supplied; wheat sought for at from 17f. to 21f. the hectolitre, being a rise of If." " ChartreR.-Market animated; a rise in wheat of If. S0c. the hecto. litre." "Montereau.-Market well supplied with wheat, but not all Fold; a slight rise." "Nancy. -Wheat 24f. the 100 kilogrammes, being arise of If.; flour 31f. the 100 kilogrammes." "O Orleans.- A moderate supply, with a rise of 2f. the sack on wheat." Letters from Marseilles state that the abundant supplies of corn arriving in that porb and the sicarcity of money had paralyzed operationo. The African hard wheat rose in Saturday's market. Wheat from the Black Sea fel Large quantities of wine continue to anrive at the market of Bercy, but prices arewell maintained) particat- larly for the winos of Burgundy, which are of very EUperiOr quality. The wines of last year have nearly disappeared, and it is the -wines of the present year that are being now retailed. There waS a serious decline in the price of spirits of wine last week. Spirits from the south have been offered at 130f. the hectolitre, and beetroot spirits from the north at 78f., without buyers. T'he price of brandy is not quoted, t6ere is Bo little businem d6ing. 'It is said that several Chambers of Commerce are preparing addresses to the Emperor, in order to explain to him the situati6R of affairs. The Courrier de Paris has arn article upon. tbe financial crisis. It attributes the existing distress masily to a general fall In prices, consequent upon a -good ha-vest, and (starting with this proposition) continues thus_ "The whole questlon comes to this-The consumer wil not buy at the old prices, and the"holder will not sell at tho new prices, because he would lose money by the bargain. The consumer is in no hurry; he can wait til the fail in the market shall be well established. BQt the middleman cannot remain long in such an attitude of expectancy. He has his biUls coming due, and he must either let them be protested or sell his goods at a heavy loss to meet his engage. ments. This explains the avalanche of failures and suspen. dons of payment wlhich, commencing in Amerlca, spread to England, and will perhaps sweep over the whole oontinent of Europe. We are now in the midst of a universal commereial liquidation, which must end in a general levelling of prices. When there is a lul in business-and we have seen that a good harvest rendered this IU everywhere inevitable-the first aymptom Is an alteration ia the proportions betweenspecio and those symbols of oredit, bank-notes4 Thus, to cite an example which every one will understandA the Bank of France puts no more notes into circulation than trade demands for tho purposes of its transactoias. Nowr, if these transactions stop, the CirculatIon of bank-notes naturally diminishes, and not only does this circulation diminish becamuse of the slackness of transaotions, but it diminishes to the extent of all the notes which are presentedlo the,Bank for payment in specie. But then the circulation of spede in the country increases in the proportion that the circulation of notes diminishes. This Is the raon why the ballon in banks always falls off during a crisis, whether that crisis be occasioned by too much or too little trade. There ha been much exaggeration in what has been said about the exportation of the precions metals to the United States. France has certainly not contributed more than 15,O00,000f. to this exportation, and we doubt much whether we have, eveu since the crisis began, sent more specie to Amnerica than we have received... . If a diminution of bullion in the Bank coffers were ooincident with a revival of trade there would be no ground for uneasiness, Bat when the diminution Is coupled with a faling off in the number of bills dicounted, it is evident that specie tends more and more to take the place of paper, for which there is less occasion Thus it is precisely when there Is the largest specie circulation that people are accused of concealinggold. No; money is not concealed-quite the reverse. It circulates, but too mauch, and that is the reason why produce does not circulate enough." The editor of the Spectateur received a warning (avertissement) last evening from M. Billault, for a feuilleton published in the number of yesterday, signed " Ichard." The warning says the feuilletoo contains assertions radically false. The assertions complained of are, that several of the sportsmen quitted the Imperial hunt at Compiegne before the conclusion to ascertain the state of the Paris Bourse and to gamble on it.

Le FordZ publishes the text of the rescript by which, with the exception of Anapa, SouchoumnKalebl, and Redout-Ealeh, all the Russian ports o the coast of the Black Sea are closed to the vessels of the other Powers. It is as follows: "Since the restoration of peace some doubts may have arisen relative to the navigation and commerce of foreign nations in the Black Sea. It is, therefore, with a view to put an end to doubts on the subject that the Imperial Government deems it advisable to make the following coinmunication to the public, and especially to foreign com. merce. "As solemnly proclaimed by the Treaty of Paris, the waters and the ports of the Black Sea are open to the commercial navies of all nations. hree from all restrictions,oom. merce in the waters and ports of the Black Sea is subject only to regulations of quarantine, customs, and polioe, in a spirit favourable to commercial transactions. " Such are the express terms of the Trcaty of Parls. It is the intention of the Imperial Government to adhera scrupulously thereto in so far as it is concerned. "But the regulations for health, customs, and polico, however liberal may be the spirit in which they are conceived, render necessary measures of surveillance, and along the Asiatic coast of the Black Sea they are doubly necessary in consequence of the internal state of the provinces of the Caucasus. " Establishments for quarantine and oustoms exist at Anapa, Souchoum-Kaleh, and Redout-Kaleh. Consequently, for the moment, those three points are alone open to foreign vessels. If, eventually, circumstances should allow the establishment of oustoms and quarantine offloes In other ocalities on the said coast, and to admit thereto foreign vessels, due notice will be given to commerce. Meantima the approach of the ports, bays, and havens on the Asiatic coast, with the exception of Anapa, Souchoum-Ealeh, and Redout-Kaleh, is prohibited to foreign vessels. "To certify the regularity of their destination foreign vessels are bound to have their ships' papers isd by the Russian consular agents. " The Imperial Government does not wish in any manner to obstruct or impede the development of legal and regular commercial transactions It is in the sanitary interest of its coasts much more than in a fiscal inteiest, it is in the inte. rest of public order, as beneficial to foreign commercia, transaetions as to those of the natives themselves, that the Imperial Government will enforce-as it has a perfect right to do-the observance of the restrictions above announced. Any attempt of the masters of foreign ships to communicate with the coast-with the exceptionof Anapa,SouchoumKaleh, and Redout-Kaleh-will therefore render it neces. sary for the Russian authorities to have recourse to those measures of repression established against smuggling and against every infrlngement of the sanitary laws. Those who expose themselves thereto must take the consequence3 of their conduct u;pon themselves." THE HANSE TOWNS. (imom Oxo ow2 cORnrsrorNrDa.) HAMIBURG, Nov. 15. Considerable anxiety Is manifested here relative to the turn which the general monetary crisis now pending iu various parts of Europe may take. There have been as yet no failures in this city of any consequence, and public credit has been firmly upheld among the principal firms throughout the crisis. The banks here have not withheld their aid in discounting bills at the current rate of from 10 to lO per cent. on paper of second-rate reputation even, and best bills are discounted at 9 to 9; freely. The hitherto high prices of all kinds of colonialproduce, and of iron and silk, have undergone a considerable reduction, as the natural consequence of the great depressioQ experienced, and the desire of many fixms to realize some of the heavy stocks on hand, and to meet payment of bills falling due. There has been one instance of failure within the last few days, in consequence of the chief of the firm, a Mr. Riemachneider, decamping suddenly, ci4 Liverpool, to the Havannah,leaving bills to the amount of about 150,000 marks banco. Two other minor housesMessrs. Haussen and Johannsen, and a M. Landau, both engaged in the export trade-have also stopped in the regular way, but the united amounts do not exceed 300,000 marks, We learn from Stockholm that the house oE I Mesnrs. Johns and Co. of that city ha engaged to gupply the loan of 20,000,000 of richsthalers banco to 'the Government to carry ouLt railway schees at an interest of 5 5-6ths per cen-t., and to be linu:. dated at par in the space of 40 years. SARDINTA. (FRO'r OURI OWN CORRsPONDMT.) TURIN, Nov. 14. The tribunal which you were lately informed had assembled at Genoa to eonsider the case of the TJune insurgents is in its duties mauch of the nature of our grand jury, since it will decide agaifst which of the prisoners a case exists and which are to be releasel. 1n' a few days after the conelusio3n of the elections .we shall probably know the result of itB investigations. In the meantime the Sardinia- Governmeat' has decided to s@t at liberty th9 )seroine of the Mazzinian attempt, Miss Jesie Meriton-White, annexing to her liberation the condition, or rather the order, that she should quit the cou ry within five dayss. The "ChevalierLumleyWoodyear de Lumley" has addressed another letter to the Armonia, accompanied by what he calls " a general list of the Siciln, Lombardo-Venetian, Tusean, Roman, Modenese, and Parmesan refugees,whom the Sardinian. Government has promised 'that of Naples to expel from Piedmont, or whom it has promised rigorously to watch (sus-veiUer) until something definitive shall be decided on concerning them.' This list presents a ftrther increase in the number of the Chevalier's alleged victims of Sardinian tyranny. He now makes them amount to 128, of whom 33 are Neapolitan and Sicilian, 2i Lombard, 59 Roman, and 10 belonging to the other States. The Sardinian Government has left off con tradicting Mr. Lumley's. statements, and, as ths public has probably by this time made up its mind as to their value, I do not think it worth while t3 take more than this brief notice of the one now advanced. Itters from Naples received here to-day stabe fthat the two English engineers had not yet been set at. liberty, and that their Consul had not beea allowed to commUicate with them. It was knowa that very strong representations concerning them bad been made on the part of England to the Neapolitan Gnvernment. The damage done by the late inundations is estimated at 15,000,000f. The Lomellina, it appears, was converted into a lake. The large proprietors of the plains can bear up against their losses, but many of the smaller holders in the mountainoni districts are reduced to great misery. At Verrua. in the Lomellina, 150 families are left without a roof to shelter them. Nevertheless, the greatest patience has been phown, and nowhera has there been any symptom of disorder. Subscriptions for the relief. of those unfortunate people cont1nue to be collected. It would have a good effoct, after KingVictor Emmanuers generous donation to tho Indian fund, and the other contributions sent to it from Piedmont, if something could be raised in England for the relief of the sifferers 4y these floods, but of course people here are aware that England has heavy calls at this moment upoa her purse and generosity; and that, with India to be subscribed for, and discount at 10 per cent., many who would gladly show substantial sympathy with the unfortunate in this country are preciuded from so doing. NAPLES. (F,-OXr oun oWN conrnSroPONDnMT.) NAPIES, Nov. 10. I send you the translation of a legal opinion as to the prohibition by this Government to permit the English engineers now in prison to see their ConsuL It has been sent to me since I last wrote, and it will add to its authority if I say that it is the united decision of several of the first advocates of Naples after a long and laborious discussion. "According to the law, an imputato cannot speak with his advocate until the process has been made public; that is to say, umtil the in.strazione of the case is completed, and it has been handed into the Chancery of the court previous to trial. In English phraseology we should say until a true bill has been found. The trial may then be proceeded with immediately; but usually an interVal of a few days elapses, when the prisoner is permitted to communicate with his counsel." Now, mark, this in the only prohibition set up by the Neapolitan law; and even this has ceased to exist, as the irw1mmne with regard to thess men is completed and they have been sent down to Salerno to stand their trial. The law, however, throws not the slightest impediment in the way of a prisoner's having free communication with his relatives, friends, or representatives, and it is an established maxim that silence sanctions. Such being the law of Naples, what is the position of the twro British subjects now in prison at Salerno ? The eircumstances of their arrest are well known. This is the fifth month of their confinement without trial. Not a friend has been permitted to visit them. Our energetic ActingConsul, Mr. Barbar, has made repeated applications for permission to do so, wfithout effect. Lord Clarendon has directed a formal demand for such a permission, still the doors move not. The Neapolitan law is grossly violated in the case of two British subjects, and tha name of Englishman ceases tobeaprotectionin the world whea In the Two Sicilies, above all other countries, men who bear the honoured name can be treated with such indignity with impunity. Are the social amenities, and a desire to conciliate the dear Majesty of the Two Sicilies, again and again to be urged as a reason for not maintaining our national dignity ? Why, His Majesty laughs at us, and sets us at defiance, and we have become a byword throughout Italy. A long-projected work is now about to be put into execution, I hear, which is the formation of a naval port in the Lake Avernus. The Emperor Augustus joined the Lakes Lucrinus and Avernus, and a powerful navy once rode in it; but the sands were thrown up by the sea into the channel of communicatilon, which was cut near Portus Julius, and an earthquake swallowed up Lucrinus in 1538, anl raised in its stead the Monte Nuovo 1,000 feot high. The persons charged by the Government to conduct this enterprise are Signor Quaranta, hydraulic architect, Signor Suarez, architect of roads and bridges, and Mr. Guppy, who is to execute it, as I hear. The contract has been signed, I am told, for 500,000 ducats and extras for extra labour. The Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, Riario Sforza, and the Archbishop of Capua, Cardinal Cosenza, 'leave Naples for Rome next Friday. There are some here who pretend that their visit has a reference to questions which were put to the Papal Court by the Imperial Court of France. Exchange on London, 546; the Five per Cents., 114.
CAPTURE OF EINBUBZW. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tust about this date two years a.,o I was engaged, with 5,000 other Englishmen, at the capture of the three forts on the Einburn Spit. We captured a large number of guns and atamunition, stores, &c., and upwards of 1,200 prisoners. One fine morning we were agreeably surprise I to hear that one of our gunboats had captured two very laTge rafts of ship timber, worth 50, 00h. One was given to our allies-why I could never understand, seeing that they were both captured by an English vessel; the other I never could hear of -there was a report thAt "it got adrift." Now, Sir, If we are to get no prize money for KEnburn, surely we are not askdng too mach in trusting that when the Parliament does meet we may be awardee a " cross," if it is only made out of the guns we took.

THE LATE DuCHESS OF NEMIOUES.-The D;bats publishes the following sad particulars of the last momaeats of her Royal Highness the achess of Neniour, extracted froin a letter from Claremont :-"1 On the 10th, at 9 in the tmorniauig,bit ieased God to send the august Queen this fresh trial.

I omit some further details of the harrowing scenes which followed and will only say that every Englishman will be gratified toleara that the kindness and sympathy of our own gracious Sovereign did much to assuage the intensity of the feelings of the august exiles.

THEB JNITBD STATES. (FROM OuR NEw YORK COIRl8PONDENlT-1 NEW YORK, Nov. 3. The political wheel hIs once more rolled round to an election-this year only of State officers. Little. interest is felt in it, and the vote wlll probably be smaller by many thousands than that of last year. The comuiercial revulsions of the autumn have quite put politics in the background, except with those who make it a trade. Besides, the great issue wbhici so excited the public last year does not enter into the " campaign" of 1857. Kanss no longer bleeds her wounds are most effectually stanched, and a healing lotion of wonderful efficacy has been applied. in the form of two proclamations by Governor. Walker. The late election results in a free State ruajorityof more than two to one in thepopular vote, and a majority of free State menineach branch of the Legislature. This result is achie red only by reject-. ing the vote in two precincts bordering upon MissourL In one, where there are six houses, a tavern, and a stable, the returpa show a pro-slavery majority of nearly 2,000; in another, where there is no population except stray squattera, an aggregate pro-slavery vote of about 1,800. These manifest frauds, so gross as to render it impossible that even the blind should not see them, were made of greater importance by the fact that if they were allowed to stand the general result would be changed. The Governor made a personal examination of the precincts, which satisfied him of the fraud, then rejected the iote, and published the facts. This course has produced more or less bluatering, and, if rumour may be believed, has caused soms trouble in the Cabinet; but these things may be regarded as the dying murmurs of a contest now virtually settled. The nearest western neighbours of Kansas are not so easily disposed of. The troops that were stayed in the territory to preserve peace during its organization have already moved on towvards Utah. The correspondent of the NWew York Times writes as followrs from Nebraska Territory, -onder date of the 22d of October: "News has just reached here from our frontier Mormon settlement nuon the Loupe Fork of the Platte River, near the mouth of Beaver, and known as the Beavdr settlement of Mormons (about 100 miles inland from here), that some renegade lMormons, gr seceders from the Mormon Church, fleeing from the D,anltes of Salt Lake, had reached that settlement a few daia since, bringing the news that a large foree of the Mozmon Militia, under.Brigham Young and Reber C. Kimball, were preparing to leave Salt Lake City, with proisions and ammunition for a six weeks' campaign in the mountains to the eastward, and thus to stop, if possible, the passaga oE the UnitedStates troops. Although the positive destination was a secret known only to the leaders of the church, yet it was generall supposed that at the pass in the mountains near Bear River cat-off, or at Steeple Rocks, the stand would be made by the Salt Lake forces, with an almost certainty of ' wiping out ' the entire force sent against them. In Salt Lake City, and through the territory, for aome months prior to this movement, the Mxilitia or volunteer force have undergone more than ordiyary drill, and a number of regiments would compare favourably, in point of dril, with the independent corps Of the States. The Mormons feel confident of destroying the force sent against them this fall, and, with their next spring's allies from the States, expect to stand a regular fight against the whole United States' available force, and not only conquer, but establish themselves as an indeRendent Government. "Between Fort Kearney and the valley these three or four men travelled almost entirely at night, and, under the guidance of one of the party, a thorough mountain man, evaded the regular travelled route, seeing no troops or Indians, and making the travel in about 19 days. They, and all the mountain men with whom I have conversed state th&t In the event of a stand being taken in some of the mpountain gores this side of Salt Lake, 10 men can easily and succeksno ly cope with loO United States' soldierm And ho knows these mountain ranges and gorges with aU their advantages and disadvantages better than the Mormons I this report also brings the somewhat expected news that muany of the Indian tribes from Southern Oregon and Utah -were secretly preparing to join the Mormon force." The Quaker City has arrived from Havannah with intelligence of the arrival there of the Star of the West with $1.,600,000 in gold for New York. She also brings gratifying confirmation of the news (refeived by the last steamer) of the vote to fund and pay the debt declared unconstitutional bv the State Court last winter. The returns were in from 35 counties, leaviug only eight to be heard from. The San Francisco journals express great satisfaction at the result,-a result which we think here may be copied without injury by some of the oldest States. Micbigan two years ago compelled a funding of an old debt at a discount. Arkansas, Mississippi, and liloida have not yet shown a wiUingness to do even as much as acknowledge their obligation to pay their debts, notwithstanding the prosperous condition of their great agricultural interest; and, if I mistake not, some of the old interest money of Pennsylvania is in arrear. In consequence of these flagrant violations of good faith all American credit has suffered indiscriminately, thegoodwith the bad-Massachusetts and New York with Florida and Arkansas. The act of a new State like California in thus resisting the temptation to make a violation of constitutional law an excuse for breaking faith is wortby of speeial commendation. The United States' Circuit Court for the Western Circuit has just rendered a decision which may be of great importance to holders of railway mortgage bonds. Not only in the West, but here (with the Erie, for instance), bonded debts have been created, secured by mortgages upon property acquired and * to be acquired," at a time when little or none of the property intended to be given as security was acquired. In a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon the Albany and New Salem Road the right of the trustees under the mortgage to hold property acquired subsequently to the execution of their mortgage was resisted by the shareholders. The case was argued at Cincinnati, and the following points decided :_ "'1. That the mortgages hold the property acquired sassequent to their execution. "2. That the franchises of taldng tolls, operatlng the roads, &c., passed by the mortgage, and may be sold on fore. closure. `3. That tho Court have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, and that the power of sale contained in the mortgage does not prevent the trustee from coming into a Court of Equity and asking a decree of foreclosure and sale. " 4. That the suit is rightly brought in the name of the tiustee alone, without joining the bondholders. "'5. That the appointment of a receiver is a matter of discretion with the Court, and, though there has been a default In the payment of interest, yet it appears that the company have done everything in their power to keep up the road, but from bad crops, &c., have not been able to meet their interest, and, by permission of the trustee and some of the bondholders, have expended the income of the road in fnishing the same. Though no receiver may be appointed for the present, yet an order may be entered requiring the company to make returns of their earninr. to the Court, and the half of the net earnings, after keeping the road in thorough working order, may be applied to the payment of the interest, and the other half to the floating debt (labourers, &c.). But if at any time it shall appear that the company is disobeying this order, or is becoming insolvent, then a receiver may be appointed. In the meantime the suit to go on."

The whole reserved strength of the city banks, including country circulation held for redemption, is now estimated at $17,000,000. The process of liquidation has ceased, the decrease of loans being less than $300,000, and the increase of deposits nearly $4,000,000. Most of the banks could expand at once, if they did not hold 'so much suspended paper. The crops are beginning to move briskly. There is again a demand for commercial paper, and the best informed merchants and bankers regard the worst as over, unless very bad ne-ws comes from England by the Arabia, iow four days out. Gold is abundant, notwithstand ng the suspenxsion, and there has not been a day since the day following the crash when it has been at any real premium. The payment of duties has gone on as usual, Stithout any difficulty; and, in fact, I under- stand that the banks have been ready to afford their customers facilities for that purpose [at all times.

BRITISH INDIA and BRITISH COLONrES. TO THS EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is as oue might have foreseen,-scarcely have the fires died out in which the mutilated bodies of English women and English children blszed for the wild exultation of fiendish fanatics when the cry of " mercy and forgiveness" is raised at home. Quiet, easy, comfortable Christians I Your sons bave not been lopped limb from limb-your daughters hive not passed to the grave through a hell of loathsome abominations more terrible than death =-your darlings have not given up their tender bodies 'to a sacrifice as awful and demoniacal as that of Moloch. You can bear the sufferings of others, and can control the hot indignation which afflictions not your own have kindled in a milion hbressts I To you I speak not; I speak to the mass of my countrymen-tbe majority of honest, unsophisticated Englishmen. I tell them frankly and unmincingly that never did a more weak and wretched sham beguile the ears and stupefy the understanding and deaden the action of men and States than that cry of " Conciliate." It is a mean, cowardly, and treacherous cry. I have tra:velled in the East. I have seen many a colony planted by English courage, daring, and endurance, enricbed by English adventure, energy, truthfulness, and justice, protected by English power and English arms. In each of these I havo !seen the miserable effort to "conciliate" an alien race miserably fail. I have seen the local Governnent (in deference to the anile wisdom of Leadenhall or Downing street) abandoning English interests, repudiating English sympathies, in order to con;ciliate sonme mongrel brood of dusky semi-civilized aliens. But were the objects of this cowardly polioy ever "conciliated" bv such pusillanimity ? Never, never, never! They regarded the policy as a sign of weakness and timidity. Where they had before respected they scorned; where they had before feared or hated they now derided us - where tbey had before submitted they now awaited a time of rising in rebellion against that once dominant -people who had now, in their eyes, proved themselves recreants and cowards. We rule, Sir, vast possessions because we were strong enough to acquire them, and were believed to be strong enough to keep them. We were also just in our dealings, and saw to the administration of right among our foreign subjects. We were scrupulously just and honest, taken in the mass. We did not wrong them, and we prevented them from wrongihg one another. We were stern, stiff, undemonstrative, and unsympathetic; but we ,could neither be bullied nor bribed. So the people feared us, but respected us, and liked us altogether better than they would have liked any other permanent foreign occupants of their shores. This was true of India, and those colonies peopled by unlike and unlkindred tribes. But of late years this has changed. We have learned to "conciliate," just as we shall learn to spare, and foster, and preach, and sing hymns to the murderers of our brethren and the violaters of our sisters. And what has come of it ? Why that which might have been expected. In not one of our foreign colonies are we as strong as we were 20 years ago. Neither in Ceylon, nor in the Manritius, nor in Corfu, nor in Malta is an Englishman-1 will not say so feared or so respected, but h,e is not even so safe in regard to his property or life as he once wae. And whom has be to thank for this? Why, his own Government, which has conciliated the Mulatto, the Hottentot, the halfFrenchman, ancd the half-Italian, until an Englishman is the atom of the population least regarded and least protected in countries won by the strong hard hand of English valour, and made wealthy by the rich irrigation of English gold and English industry. I repeat, Sir, what thousands of Englishmen will confirm. The Oriental respects only where he fears. Stow yourselves strong-strong in arms, in valour, Iz battle-and he crawls before you. Disarm yourselves, or equip yourselves in the armour of charity, b'enevolence, and " conciliation," and he-what he does then the history of the lst four months will I We are now, it is true, smarting under a mUitary mutiny. But recollect that tho Indian legis]ttion of late years has been graduaUy loosenmng the hold of English prestige on the Indian mind. Y'our army rebels after their unmilitary compatriots have well learnt the lesson of equality which you so '"concillating,ly" taught them. You, the legislator,s and well-wishers of India, have villingly and knowingly a.bdicated your supremacy; you have proclaimed that the Indian is as fit to try an Englishman in a court of justice as an Englishman is to try an Indian. You have allowed-nay, encouraged the half-civilized Parsee littemteur, proud of his imperfect smattering, to circulate as far as he could find meet audience his ffithy libels against yblr countrymen and countrywomen. You have thought to raise the Indian to your level-he has dragged you dowFn to his; and howr do you propose to govern Indla hereafter, O ye philanthropic and philosophic legislators of to,o much faith?> But why speak of India?s Depend upon it there snot so very wide a diffierence between the Oriental of Bengal and the Italian Celt of Malta, or Italian GXreek of Corfu. There is much of the Asiatic in the character of each. Like the Asiatic, both of them respect justice a-nd equity only when appended to substantial power and physical resources.

EZNGLISH ROADS AND ROADMAKING. TO THEr EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-Having afforded Mr. William Howitt room in your paper of the 13th inst. to put the question, " Do oar roadmakers ever go to Franco?" -ill you kindly allow me as much space as will briefly answer Mr. Howitt's question and correct some observations of his on that all-important subject the road repairs? Oar roadmakers have been to France. In 1829 I accompanied my father, William WMAdam (the eldest son of Mr. M'Adam, the inventor of the system of ioadmaking) to Paris, at the request of the then French Goverument, to inspect the public roads about Paris, and advise as to the best method of improving them. Subsequently some French gentluemen were instructed by us in this country In the art of repairing roads. Since then Sir James M'Adam (my grandfather's second bon) paid several professional visits to France, and very 2ecently was consulted by the French on tho subject of convirting pavement into stoned roads. My grandfather, John Loudon WA'dam, invented, or rather concelved, his system of road making and repairing In Scotland when acting as a trusteo and commisdoner of zoads in the yoar 1794, and gave his first evidence on that subiect before a committee of the House of Commons in 1811. He never was in France. Credit is dne to the French nation for the manner in o hich they have improved their roads since 1830, at which time the carriage and horse tracks they possessed did not deserve the name of roads; and I do not hesitate in saying that this improvemeat is due to the advice, the instructio a and tho various publications of Mr. U'Adam and his family, and the great aptitude of the French to adopt that which is proved to be useful. Mr. Howitt is correct in his observation on tho quantity of material spread upon the London roads. The stones are not sufficiently broken, and are unshilfully applied. Mr. Howitt is mistaken if ho thinks the use of a heavy roller " to consolidate the new material," as it is said, is unknown to the roadmakers in this country. It was invented by a Mr. Clay many years sinceo, has been tried in many places, and sibaally failed, as it ever mu3t do for sciontific rea-sons which cannot be compressed into such a paper a, ,his. The last one I k-now of was sold in 1855, it having been in disuse for upwards of 20 years. ; Independently of the roller failing to produce the effeol reqtired, the cost of dragging it over newly laid stones is so greMt that it would very shortly make bankrupt even the waywardens of a London parish. Itfs an admiable thing for footwalks, but the constraetiori, wear, and method of repairing footwalks and carriage roas are totally different, I am. Sir. yonr verv yhM-t -4 WILLIAE i'DA.

THE HBEALTH OF LONDON. (From the WeeklY Return of the Registrar-Gener ) In the week that ended on Saturday (November 14th) the total number of deaths registered in London was 1,161:, which approximates Tery closely to the number in the pre. vions week. In the ten years 1847-56 the average ntuabor, of-deaths in the weeks correspondiDg with the last was 1,068; and in the present population, which has roeoived au increase, the same rate of mortality would produce 1,175;: deaths. The difference, therefore, between the actnai number of deaths and the number as estmatted a inonsdderable. But the returns show that there has been a decided in; creue of deaths in the last two woeks, for the weekly num her in October was only about a thousand. Old persozts appear to have suffered from the weather that bas lately provailed; for, whereas in the last week of October ti number of persons who died between the ages of 60 and 8o yearm wAs 152, last week it was 207; and thongh of those who had attained the age of 80 years and upwards there were in the former perfod only 32 deaths, the number last week was 50. Diseases of the respiratory organs (exdusive of phthisis and whooping-cough), which in Augus were fatal in 70 or 80 cases weekly, and in the last week of October in 190 casce, rose last week to 29L Of the number last mentionod, 162 deaths were referred to bronchitis, 108 to pneumonia or mnfla . tion of the langs, 19 to asthma. At this time whenz influenza is common, only six cases are returned under this speciftic designation in the medical certificates. Phthiais attests to some extent the presence of the same atmosphoric influence, the deaths under this head having risen from 130 to 15L There were only 19 deaths last week from dLarrhoea; and it is satisfactory to find that no deaths from obolera were reported. Scarlatina is prevalent in the west districts, and in that part of London it was fatl in 22 cae ; the number returned in all the metropolitan distriets is 56, Typhus (including under this head common fever) carried off 54 persons. Five nonagenarlans are returned as having died in the week. The oldest of these had arrilved at the great age of 99 years. He had been formerly a farmer, and le died at 3, Brewer-street north, Clerkenwel. Last week the births of 907 boys and 830 girls, in all 1,737 children, were registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,14g. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the baromaeter in the week was 30'341in. The mem daily barometrical reading xose above 30in. on the 7th inst., and coatinued above it through the whole of lat week. The mean reading on Thursday was S0-569 in. The highest reading in the week occurred on that day, and was 3061 in. The mean temperature of the week ws 451 deg., which is 11 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The smallest range of temperature occurred ona Tuesday, and was 5'1 deg.; the greatest on Thursday, when It was 17 2 deg. On the latter day the thermometer fell 2 degrees be. low the freezing point of water. The mean daily range of temperature in the week was 10-3 deg. The mean dew point temperature was 442 deg.; and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was only 0 9 deg. On four days the humidity of the atmosphere was 99, complete saturation being represented by 100. The temperature of the water of the Thames fell daily during the week. On Sunday and Monday the highest tempera. ture of the river was 541 deg,; the lowest oocurred on Saturday, and was 48-2 deg. The wind was almost always in the north or north-east. No rain fell to an amount raeasurable by the gauge.

VTICE.CHANCELLORS' COURTS. Nov. 17. JSUVIuZu, BAIRT.. V. SfA2L1RY.-COCKA V. SrASLNY. (Before Vice-ChIncellor Sir J. FTUAI1'.) In the former of the above suits there were no le-so than 41 defendants, and in the latter no less than 54. The number of learned counsel engaged in the two cases was, as far as we coald ascertain, 28; and the nuuber of the liruns of solicitors likewise engaged in tho two suits was no less than 2L The first bill was filed by Sir Arthur de Capel Brooke, Bart., and prayed for the redemption or foreclosure of a Lnort. gage made by Dame Maria Stanley Massey 6tanley, and her son John Massey Stanley, who were respectively, the former tenant for life in possession, and the latter tenant in fee in rernainder, of certain large estates devised by tbe willof the late Sir Carnaby Haggerston. The second suit W as instittted by Messrs. Cox and Biddulph, who are mortgagees of the sanme property; for an aocount of the various encambrances affect' tg it, and that the defendants might be decreed to pay to the plaintiff the amounts found due to the latter, or that the defendants inight be foreclosed.

Whitehorn, Mr. Jenkinson, Mr. Brooksbank, Mr. Fischer, and Mr. Row- The VICx-CSANCZLLOtR made one decree In the two suits, and directed a reference to ascertain w hat was doe for prin- ipal and interest on the several encumbrances affecting the estates in question, and their respective priorities, reserving all costa. His Honoar said that he wished it to be distinctly nnderntood that In cases of this kind, where there were more than oO partles, it was eminently the duty of the Court to take care thateverything should be done to compel the litigation to be conducted with al the expedition consistent with justice, in order that the parties might as speedily as possible obtain that to which they were entitled. The Court, added the Vice-Chancellor, has, perhaps, too little control over those parties who actively conduct litigation. There are, in cases of this kind, too often scandalous delays on the part of professionial men or tbeh- clients-I do not know which; and it is deeply to be lamented that in my chambers, and I believe in those of the other judges of the court, and still more In the Masters'-offioes, there are suits and litigations, in various forms, not in an entirely dormant state, but In a state occasioning an expense which somebody must bay; therefore I expect that if there be any one among the mumerous parties to these saits, who is active in pursuing his rights, that finds himself delayed in any way by those tsot appearing who ough' to appear, or by any want of due diligence, or any attempt on the part of any one to delay 'what ought to be expedited-I expeot that that encumbrancer will oome before me and state his complaint, and I will do al I can do, where I find delay, to mako those smart for It by whom I find It to be ocoasioned. (Bcfore Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) SPIrXS V. BROWN. Mr. Cairns, Q.C., Mr. Giffard, and Mr. W. P. Murray appeared in support of the motion for a decree In this suit, 'hlich was oommenced on Monday, to restrain the sale and publication of a work called Contfancsau's French-English and Bnglish,-Frcnch Dictionary, and for the usual account of profits made by the sale of coples already sold. The author of the work in question, M. Contanseau, is the Professor of French at Addieicombe College, and the other defendants, Messrs. Brown, Longaan, and Co., are the wellknown publishers. The plaintiff, Dr. Spiers, is a British subject, resident at Paris, where he holds the appointment of Professor of English at several public institutions. lIe is the author of several works, and among them of a French and English Dictionary, in two volumes octavo, and of a smaller work known as Spier's School Dictionary, being an abridgment of the other two. In two of these dictionaries-namely, the French-Snglish 8vo., and the School Dictionary-Dr. Splers olaims to be entitled to copy. right in this country, and it is for the alleged infringement of this copyright by M. Contanseau that the present ault Is instituted. The facts of the case are shortly these: -The plaintiff's larger dictionaries were first commenced by 'him in 1835, at tho request and under the auspiGeS of M,. Gulzot, then Minister of Public Instraction, the system on which they were arranged being, as alleged by the bill of complaint, for the most part entirely novel in dictionaties of the two languages, and the works themselves being far more copious and extensive than any dictionaries theretofore published. The sources from which they were composed included, as shoNvn on the title-page, the French dictionaries of L'Acad6mie, Laveaux, Boiste, Beacherelle, &c. ; the English dictionaries of Johnson, Webster, Richardson, &c., and many special dictionaries and works of both languages. The original characteristics of the work were set forth in the plaintiff's bill under 23 different heads, and, in addition to these, the typographical arrangement was insisted on as altogetber novw, the chief features of this arrangement being the separation of the acceptations from the idioms, which open a new paragraph; and the printing of definitions (when given at all) In parentheses and in a different type, to prevent their being confounded with the proper eouivalents. Tho period oco-| pied by Dr. Spiers in the composition of this wvork extended over 14 years, the large Englh.French dictionary being published in the year 1846, but the French-English part not being completetill 1849. The English-French part was f'rst published in France, and in this, therefore, no copyright could of course be claimed. The French-English part, however, was first published in England, and duly registered at Stationers'-hall ; and this had also been the case with the abridgment or school dictionary afterwards composed by Dr. Spiers, and published In 185L On the publication of each of the larger works the use of it in French colleges was duly authorized by the Minister of Public Instruction, after having been submitted to the examination of the council of that department, and the bllU alleged that since the publication a considerable profit had been realised by their sale, the work having already gone through several editions. Each of the works in question, as weRl as the abridgment, is preceded by a preface, in which the aileged original characteristics are arranged under 10 different heads, and to each of these heads is annexed a short article explanatory of the plan adopted by the plaintif with reference to each particular characteristic. At the commencement of the present year the work complained of was first published under the the title of " A Practical Dictionary of the 7,-ench and English £anguagcs, composed from the Frcnch Dictionaries of the Academy, Boistc, BeschereUe, &fc. -from the English Dictionaries of Johinson, Webater, Richasrdson, -c.; and from Technological and Scientific Dictionaries of both Languyoes." This work of M. Contanseau is also preceded by a preface, in which the characteristics are arranged under seven heads, and a short explanatory article annexed to each, the work itself being in the form of a large manual in one volume. The grounds on which Dr. Spiers founds his charge of piracy against M. Contanseau are several. The identity between the leading characteristics, the close resemblance between passages in the defendant's preface and that of The School Dit ionary, the introduction by the defendant of numerous words and acceptations to be found only in the plaintiff's diotionaries, the faot of the defendant's work abounding in peculiarities, omisslons, errors, and misprints, wvhich also characterize the plaintiff's early editions, and on a general comparison of the two works. In support of there charges several instances selected from the two dictionaries were set forth in parallel oDlumns in the bill of complaint. The case originally came before the Court before the vacation on an ilterlocutory motion for an injunction, when a preliminary objection was taken by the defendant's counsel to the title of Dr. Splers to any copyright at all on two grounds,-namely, first, thal the works in question, though first published in England, were printed in France; and secondly, that they were published without any printer's name, contrary to the statute 2d and 3d of Vrictoria, cap. 12, eec. 2. The arguments on these objections having been heard, the Vice-Chancellor, after consideration, was of opion that they were not of sudicient weight to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with the motion for the injunction, which was again brought before his Honour during the vacation. An arrangement was then come to, by which the motion was agreed to be turned into a motion for a decree; the question of infringement to be tried first by the Vice-Chanoellor alone, and in the event of the plaintiff making out his case, then the question of title to be heard by the ViceChancellor, assisted by a common law judge or judges plaintiff and defendant both waiving their right to appeal from his Honour's judgoment. The case is now, therefore brought before the Coart on the question of infringement only, and from the number of the affidavits, exhibits, counter-exhibits (printed as weU as written), the documentary evidence in the shape of the original manuscripts of the several works, and a mass of Frenoh and English dictionaries on which the defendant relies as the sources from which he composed his works, the case appears likely to occupy the Court for a considerable time, The case alleged by the plaintiff's biUl is supported by numerous affidavits, and among others by the evidence of M. Brasseur, the French tuitor of his Royal Highness the Prinee of Wales; M. Morlet, Professor of Prench at the London University; and M. Delille, the French master at Christ's Hospital and other educational institutions, all of whom depose to the origimality of Dr. Spiers's dictionaries and their great superiority over those which had preceded them, an originality and superlority which are denied by the defendant. In addition to the case thus made by Dr. Spiers, several other points in Urof of the piracy were pressed upon the Court by Mr. airus in his opening, which is not yet concluded, arising out of the orlgfaal manuscript itself of M, Contanseau,whioc is produced, and is in his own handwriting. As to the poiuts thus urged, however, wve reserve any further report until the defendant's case shall have been heard. d Mr. Rotlt, Mr. WiUicock, and MIr. Cole appear for the Mr. Cairns will resume his opening at the conclusion of the motions. FORBES V. FORBes, The VICE-CIIANCELLOR gave judgment in this case>which has been recently argued before him. The object of the suit shortly stated was to establish against the estate of the late Sir Charles Forbes, in the hands of his executors, a binding declaration of trust in respect of a portion of a certain fund in favour of the plaintiff and her family, The VrCx-CLsNcNCLLoR said that it was well established that a valid trust, to which the Court would give effect, azose where there was a clear indication of a definite intention to part with property in favour of another person, it being immaterial whether that person was a volunteer or took for valuable consideration, and also whether the intention of the settlor was commanicated to the intended cestuique4trust or not. Applying this prinoiple' -he -circumstBaces of the case. before him (which Heis ldbalis' #ated at some- length), he would not say that there ta&-been such u compnlete parting with the fund by Sir Chles Forbes that, vhatever auight be the ultimate foram efNiuvestment, It was permanuently appropriated end ear- marked avith the trust now sought to be enforced. It was merely an inchoate transaction- r,ot couipleted in the lifetime of Sir C. Forbes, and the Cottrt conld not carzy it into effect in favoar of the plaintiff. Her husband, Michie Forbes, could not have filed a bill so have his portion of the fund transferred, to him. Sir Charles Forbes intended to retain his control over the fumd, ar.d this not merely as to the way in which it was to he invested, but as to its disposition. Another instrument beyond the expressions contained in the letters was necessary to complete the plaintiff's title. No such instrumezt was executed by Sir F. Forbes, and though the case was a very hard one he could not do otherwise than dismiss the bill, though, under the circumstances, without costs. Mr. Rolt and Mr. A. Smith were coun-sel fir the plaintiff; the Attorney-General, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Slhomiberg, and Mr. Nugent for the defendants.
COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH. WENMLTNTT.P. Nnv- 17 mTrr.y.vm v worn;:A. r.r. (Sittings in Banco, before Lord CAMIELL andl Justices COLERIDGE. WrITTNrAxN. .d RlI; \v This was a special caso for the opinion of the Courb, and which raised the question whethor, under the circurnstances stated, the defendant, an underwvriter, was entitled to any deduction in the nature of freight. The plaintiff was the owner of the ship Melbourne, on board of which he had shipped a cargo of timber at St. John's, New Brunswick. The plaintiff insured to the extent of 2C 001. on freight, and 10,00.1. on the ship. The defendant underwrote one of the policies on freight. The vessel sailed for Liverpool, but encountered a gale of wind, and was stranded off South. port, about 20 miles from port. The plaintiff thereupon gave notice of abandonment to the underwriters on ship, but not to the underwriters on freight, but before the notice of abandonment was accepted the plaintift; by lightening the I ship, succeeded In discharging part of the cargo, and then broughq the vessel with the rest of the cargo safe, to Liverpool. In adjusting tho loss among the several pgrties interested, the question had arisen whether theunderwriters on ship were entitled from the plaintia to any allowance in thenature of freight; and, if so, to whatextent,-whetheron the whole cargo, or only on that portion aotually brought to Liverpool. A further question was also raised-viz., how the freight, if allowed, was to be calculated, whether it was to be the cost of the cargo lees the net proceeds and lighterage, or the current rate of freight at St. John's at the time when the ship sailed. Mr. Broun was heard for the plaintiff; and Mr. Colin Blackburn, for the defendants. Lord CAMPBELL said he thought the abandonees were entitled to some deduction in the nature of freight; but the Court would take time to consider how mnch, NORRIS V. THB IRISH L.ND COIPAINY. The plaintiff in this action was the administrator of the late Jo n Sadleir, and he sued the Iribh Land Company to recover dataages for the refusal to register the plaintiff as a shareholder in the company in the room of the late Mr. Sadleir, one of the shareholders. The declaration set out that by letters patent granted by the Crown the Irish Land Company was incorporated, provision being made in the charter that a deed of settlement approved by the Board of Trade should bo executed, which should contain provisions for the registration of the names of the shareholders, and the appolntment of a hoard of directors for the manage. ment of the company, &o. The declaration then alleged that a deed had been accordingly prepared, which was executed by the deceased. The deed provided that the names of the shareholders should be entered in a book, that shares should be personalty, that executors and adminis. trators should not be proprietors, but that they might become so on certain terms, which, were set out. The declaration then aleged that the late Jobn Sadleir had esecuted the deed, and that the plaintiff, his adminis. trator, had given the required notices, and caUed upon the company to register his name as a share. holder. The breach alleged was that the company had refused to register the plaintiff's name as a share. holder, and that the name of the late John Sadleir still remained as such shareholder in the register-book. The declaration concluded, under the 68th section of the Coin mon Law Procedure Act, 1854, with a claim of mandamus, commanding the company to register the plaintiff's name. To this claim the defendants demurred, and thus raised the question whether the plaintiff was, under the circumstances, entitled to the writ. Mr. ASPLAND, for the defendants, contended that this was not a duty for the enforcement of which a msandamus would lie. There was no statutory obligation resting on the company to do the act; that depended only on the deed of settlement, prepared under the charter. In the case of "Benson v. Paul" (0, . and B., 273), this Court had de. cided that a plaintiff was not entitled to a mandamus under the 68th section to compel the defendant to execute a lease according to his contract, and the Court said that the claim could only be made where the prerogative writ of man. demus would lie. Mr. MACNAMARA, in support of the claim, said the duty of keeping the register-book was imposed by the charter; and he cited several cases to show that, even before the late statute, if a Royal charter Imposed duties on public bodies in which the public were interested, the Court would grant a mandamus to enforce the performance of the duty. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment, on the ground that the case came within the 68th section of the 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 125. The writ claimed wes for the fulfilment of a duty, in the fulfilment of which the plaintiff was personally interested-viz., to have his name entered in the book of sbareholders of the company. He (Lord Campbell) adhered to the decision of this Court in " Benson v. Panl," and thought the intention of the Jegislature was not to give to the courts of common law a power to decree a specific perform. auce of a contract. But this was not a case arising out of a mere personal contract, but from a Royal charter; and the act to be done was one in which not only the plaintiff, but the public also had an interest. From the report of " Ben. son v. Paul" It appeared that he (Lord Campbell) had said that the 68th section was confined to cases where the duties could be enforced by the prerogative writ of man. damus; but, on consideration, he was not prepared to say that that was the precise limit. But even if it was so there were many cases which showed that the present was one in which the writ would have been granted. The plaintiff was entitled to the shares as the representative ol Mr. Sadleir, and the company refused to register his name as shareholder. The Court would therefore have granted a mandamus to the company to do the act. This was a case In which the plaiatiff was entitled to the remedy which he sought. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, Mr. Ju8ti,e WIGHTMAN, and Mr. Justice ERLZ expressed themselves to the same effect. Mr. MACNAMARA prayed that a peremptory mandamus might be awarded. Lord CAauPBiELL.-Let a peremptory sandamus he awarded. On the application of Mr. ASPLAND the order was made subject to the proviso that there were no issues in fact to be tried. Judgment accordingly. BAILEY V. CICSON AND OTGERSE This was an appeal from the decision of the judge of a County Court. The aotion was brought against four members of the Worksop Local Board of Health to recover the sum of 211. 14s. for work and labour in attending and giving evidence before a committee of the House of Commons. Some parties at Worksop had introduced % Gas BI into Parliament, and the defendants present at a meet. ing of the Local Board of Health had passed a resolution authorizing their clerk to oppose the Bill. The plaintiff, at the request of the clerk, gave evidence before the committee, and subeequently sent in his biUl to the board. The board made a general district rate under the 87th section of the Public Health Act (l1th And 12th Victoria, cap. 63), to defray this and other expenses, but the rate was quashed by this ourt, upon the ground that some of the expenses had been illegally incurred. When sued in the County Court the defendants relied on the 140th section of the Act, which enacted that no contract entered into by the said local board, if the contract were entered into " bond fide for the purpose of executing the Act," should subject any member perEonally to any notion, but that all expenses so incurred should be paid out of the general district rate. The judge nonsuited the plaintiff, and on this appeal being brought stated that the defendanuts had acted " bond fide in their public capacity as members of the local board." Mr. Serjeant HAYEs contended that the nonsuit ought to he set aside, as the judge had not found that the expense incurred was "bondfide for the purpose of executing the Act." Mr. BODEN contended that the board and not the defend. ants ought to have been sued. Lord CAMPB}ELL said he thought the nonsuit could not be supported. But the defendants might show that they were acting " bond fide for the purpose of executing the Act ;" and that it was necessary for them to oppose the bill, and that they were acting with the consent of the ratepayers, and within the scope of their authority. It might also Appear that thle plaintiffgave credit to the board, and not to tedefend ants. The other judges were of the same opinion. The nonsuit was accordingly set aside. Mr. Serjeant HA,YES applied for the costs, but Lord CAMPBELL said there would be ao costs, as it was not known who ultimately might succeed. TIcE QUrEEN V. BROWN AND OTuERS. Mr. C. R.

COUTRT OF COmOmrO PT.RWiAq 'TTr.CnAV NT-, VT MONTAGUE V. HA-RRISON. P - - 'r._T_ - V. Al. Wiz case JUr. !erjeant BYLEs showed cause against a rule calling on the plaintiff to show cause why the defendOnt, 'who was brought up on habeas corpus, should not forthwith be diseharged out of cuastoy. It apPe3red from the affidavit of the defendan's attorney that on the 4th of August last he was attending as a pro- tornd tnese ae the Marylebone Police-office before ronghton 04 a charge of felony, when the cas Ws adoutrndedf to the 6tb, and wzhile leau the court he wa arsefor debt and conveyed to the prison of the county of Middlesex, withollt any w/arrant qr au.thority belng prorlnced, at the suit of D?ayd MIonf ague for a debt of 324,, and that he had reason to believe that this was done to prevent his attendance at -the -hearing at the police-office on the 6sh. The defendant, who, was namned George Henry de ChevalierPlarstagenet Harrison, and who, wvt said to bs descended from He ry. VI.-a fact whieQh the learned serieant hoped would not prejudice him in. that court-in his aidavt deposed that he was a material and necessary witnees in the inquiry before themagistrate, whioh lwas a charge of felony against the plaintiff. In answer-to these affidavits one was pit in by a person named Rungbear, a clerk to the plaintiff, sBating that he had heard there was a prosecution going on ab the suit of General Harrison at the Blarylebone Police-office, who he was informed and-believed had obtained goods and furiture to a large amount from the plaintiff, who had got an execution against him, 'and under the assumption that this was General H:arrison he hadf him ar-rested; that the plaintiff had attempted to get back his goods, and in doing so had taken about 1Z. worth -which did not bcelong to him, and for this the -defeeidant charged him with felony at the police-court. -At the tume of the arrest the defendant was not bound over as a witness, but afterwards, when the -msgistrate sent the case to the old Bailey, he was, and there the grand jury threw out the bill. The learned serjeant now contended that there waq no moral or legal duty which rendered it obligatory on the defendant to attend at the pohceoffice. His appearance there was purely voluntary. He referred to the cases of "Diekens v. Smith" (1 Henry Blackstone's Reports), "Exzparte King" (7 Vesey, 712), "C ameron v. Lightfoot" (2 Wm. Blackstone's peports, 790). The privilege was not that of the person wbo attended the court, but of the court he attended, and it had been disallowed when a party attended as a volunteer and not upon process. "IMagnay v. Bart" (5 Q. B., 81), Anon. 1 DowL P. C., 157), "Jacobs v. Jacobs" (3 Dowl. P., C.), Anon. (2 Salk,, 544; 11 Mod. 79) " Goodwin v. Lowland" (1 ad. DaL, 379), "Hare v. hytie" (25 L. T., Q. B. 155). Attendance before an arbitrator was privileged because the arbitration was part of the cause; but no case could be found where the privilege was setup for attendance before a magistrate. Mr. Serjeant ATEnsoN, in support of the rule, sub mnitted that the defendant was bound, in point of fact, to appear as a witness, and that there was an obligation upon him, in point of law, to do so. The defendant knew of a felony having been committed, and he submitted that if he did not give information of the felony an indictment wouald lie against him for misprision of felony. The Lor CHIE JusTicx thought such an indictment could not be sustained. But, without calling on the learned serjeant to proceed vrith his argument, the Court thought the rule should be made absolute. It was unnecessary, if a party proceeded to a police-office with the view of putting the criminal law in motion, to decide whether the rivileges from arrest existed, because here the case might e disposed of on other grounds. Here the defendant had gone before a magistrate and had obtained a warrant against certain persons whom he charged with felony. These parties were brought before the magistrate, and he remanded the inquiry for further hearing at a future day. On that day the defendant attended as prosecutor and witness. The magistrate again remanded the further hearing of the case, and on leaving the court the defendant was arrested. Now, it was clear the magistrate might, If he had entertained any doubt thatthe defendant, asprosecutor or wit. ness, would not attend, have either bound him over in recognizances, or have caused him to be served with a summons. The defendant, however, attendedvoluntarily. He (the Lord Chief Justice) entertained not the slightest doubt that the police-court before which this inquiry was instituted was a court with reference to which a witness in attendance before it was entitled to this privilege. The other learned JUDGES concurred. Rule absolute. THOMPSON V. ITARDING, P.O. In this case Mr. Serjeant BrLEs showed cause against a rule calling on the plaintiff to show cause why James Bush Hill, brought up on isaeas corpu, should not be discharged out of custody. It appeared that the applicant was a shareholder of the Royal British Bank, of which company the plaintiff was a creditor. That bank became bankrupt in October last. In December the plaintiff proved his debt against the company, and in Hilary Term following obtained judgment against the defendant as the public officer of the bank. On the 31st of January the plaintiffobtained an order under the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 113, against the applicant as a shareholder of the bank, having failed to obtain satisfaction of his judgment from the property of the company. On the 13th of February the appliant became bankrupt, and in May obtained a first-class certificate. In April an application was made by the plaintiff to Mr. Serjeant Goulburn, the Bankruptcy Commissioner, to be allowed to prove his debt under Hill's bankruptcy. The Comrmissioner was of opinion that the plaintiff should be allowed to claim his debt but not to prove it, and in the event of Hill's creditors being satisfied, then the plaintiffs claim of his joint debt against the applicant and other shareholders might be satisfied out of the surplus, if there were any. On the llth of August last the applicant was arrested othe plaintiff's debt. The plaintiffhadobtainedanorder under the Winding-up Act, 11th and 12th of Victoria, cap. 75, sec. 63, subjecting the applicant to execution, and under that order he was arrested. On not being allowed to prove with the separate creditors under Hill's bankruptcy, a oa. ea. had been obtained, and Mr. Hill had been arrested, and to be discharged from that arrest he ought to have gone to the Court of Review, under the 205th section of the Bankrupt Act, 12th and 13th of Victoria, cap. 106. Mr. LusH, Q.C., in support of the rule, contended that whether the applicant's debt were joint or several It was barred by his certificate. If a man who was a partner became a bankrupt, his certificate barred every claim. He referred to the 200th and 205th sections of the Bankrupt Act in support of this view, and as his authority for apply. ing to the court out of which the process had issued to order the ap licant's discharge. The ROBD CHIEF JUSTICE said the Court was of opinion thatthe rule should be made absolute. Mr. Hill waspartnerin a joint-stock banking company, which company having become bankrupt, the plaintiff in this action, a creditor of the company, recovered judgment against the officer of the company, and, being unable to obtain satisfaction of his judgment from the assets of the company, he sought under an order of this Court to have execution of his judgment against Mr. Hill, a shareholder in the company. Mr. Hill In the meantime, had become bankrupt in his individuai oharacter, apart from his character of a shareholder of this company, and his separate estate was available for the pay - ment of his separate creditors~, and after the satisfaotion of their debts for the payment of the demands to which be had become a party as a shareholder of the company. The plaintiff put in hi claim against his separate estate, and his claim was allowed, but it was not admitted to proof against the separate estate until such time as the separate creditors should be satisfied. In either case he was entitled to the protection of the bankrupt laws. As a member of a partnership of .which he was a partner, he had become jointly liable to satisfy debts due from the partnership, and as a bankrupt his property was liable to satisfy his private debtors, and against both sets of creditors he was entitled to personal immunity under the bankrupt laws. They were not called upon to determine whether this was or was not a debt provable against the separate estate. Then, was this Court the proper tribunal for the purpose of obtaining his liberation? He was of opinion that this application had been properly made to that Court out of which the process had issued. The application was within the termus, and certainly within the spirit of the 205th section of the Bankrupt Act. There was in this Court, as in every court of justice, an inherent authority to prevent the abuse of its ocess, and the maoment the bankrupt had obtained his certEic°ateahe became entitled to the immunity from arrest which the bankrupt laws awarded, and his detention under the process of this court was an abuse of the process. The rule must therefore be made ab. solute, The other learned JUDGES concurred, Rule absolute. (Sittings af Nisi Psriut, at Westminster, beJore Mr. Jusice CRESSWELL anud a Common Jury.) FOSTER V. JONES. Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Gibbons appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Parry and Ir. Petersdorff were counsel for the defendant. The trial of this cause, which was commenced on Satuar day and adjourned at the rising of the Court on that day to ths mornimg, was resumed. lt was an action brought to recover damages for false imprisonment, and it appeared that the defendant, suspecting the plaintiff of having removed from 58, Upper Seymour-street, St. Paucras, some firestovesandtother fixtures belonging to him, gave the plaintiff into custody on the charge of having taken them. The case was investigated and eventually, after having in the meantime been released on bail, 3r. Foster was discharged by the magistrates, and now brought his action against Mr. Jones, who justified his conduct by alleging in his plea thathbe badreasonable and probable cause for believing that the plaintiff had appropriated his property. A great mans of evidence was adduced on either mide, a full report of whioh would be tedious in the extreme, and totally devoid of interest excepting to the parties immediatelv concerned - The main points in the case seemed to be wvhether or not a stove found on the premises of the plaintiff belonged to the defendant, and whether or not the plaintiff had been ssen near the house whence the property had been removed on a certain day in June last 'The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.-Damages 701.

ADMIRALTY COURT. TuESDAY. NOv. 17- Tl[;E ELIZAEBRT WVTT!.nT.v - I T - I- (Before Dr. LUSHINGTON.) tlhis was a claim for salvage made by the owners, master, and crew of a steamtug called the Pilot, of Sunderland, against the owners of a brig called the Elizabeth Wilthew. The case of the salvors was that on the 7th of April last, the weather being thick and foggy and a strong sea ranning, the pilot found the Elizabeth Wilthew labonring heavily, in the midst of broken water,within 90 fathoms of an etensive and dangerous snnken rock off the port of Sunderland, called Hendon Rock upon which she was In peril of being driven when the tie turned. The pilot boarded and todk charge of the brig1, and eventually towed her into 'the south dock of Snederland. The owners of the brig denied that she was in any peril when she was boarded by the pilot, or that ehe would have run upon the Hendon 'Roc1k at'the turn of the tide, inasmuch as that rock was distaht three- quarters of a mile from the vessel; wbioh had passed It, and' was in H[endon Bay, They asserted that the steamtug had only bcen employed to put a pilot on board and to tow the br3g into port, and that no risk had been mcurred by the tug in performing that service, Tho i brig was valued at 1,800z., and 501. had been tendered to the pilot for the ser ice rendered, and rejected. The case was argued by Dr. Adams anm. Dr. Twiss for the salvors, and by Dr. Jenner and Dr. Spinks for the owners. The Conrt took time to consider its decision. TIE MARTTI LUTHER.- SALVAGE. The question in tlis case was to what att ount of salvage the steamship Tagus, belonging to the Peninsulxr and Oriental Company, was entitled or some services rendered to the martin Luther. It appeared that the Tagus was on her way from Gibraltar to Southamuton witb mails and passengers, when, on the 6th of April last, between 20 and miles off the coast of Ushant, sbe feU in with the Martin Luther, which mado signals of distress, and was taken in tow by the Tagus and conveyed to Plymouth. The Martin Luther was a vessel of 1,200 tons barden, and was bound from Liverpool for Quebec with 500 passengers, but had been much damaged by bad weather, and had drifted far out of her coarse when she was found by the Tagas. The value of the Martin Luther, with freight and cargo, was 12,0001., and the only point in dispute was the amount to wch the salvors were entitled. The Tagus had been delayed for about 24 hoars by rendering these services to the The Admniralty- A dvocate and Dr. Deane appeared for the alvors; Dr. A.ddams and Dr. Twlss for the Martin Dr. LusWNGToI said that, having regard to the position of peril in which the Martin Luther was placed and to the occupation in which the Tagus was engaged-nameTy, the carrying of Her Majesty's mals-at the time when the services were rendered, he should award the sum of 1,5001.

POLICE. MARBOROUJGH-STREEr.-Edwin Collins, footman, Waa charged with having burglarionsly stolen a large quantity of sliver plate, the property of his master, Mtr. Defries, of Fitzroy-square. Two persons are aready in custody and under remand on the same charge. Police.constable Lambert, B 68, said, in consequence of informration he received he went to Wokingham, where the prisoner, who had been in the service of Mr. Defries, was living with his father. On seeing the prisoner he told him he was a police-constable and must apprehend him for robbing his late master of a quantity of plate. The prisoner, without any promise or threat, voluntarily said, he would not deny the robbery and would tell him al about It presently. The prisoner asked him if he had seen a man named Sullivan recently. He said he had, and added that Sullivan was nov in custody. The prisoner then stated that Sullivan had one half of the plate and he had the other. The prlsoner mentioned that he also had a topcoat belonging to Mr. Doefres. As they were coming to the train he asked the prisoner when he had seen Sullivan last. The prisoner said, he had not seen him Eince the morning of the robbery, and that was in Marylebone-lane, where he was taking the plate to dispose of to a person there. At this stage of the proceedings Mr. Defries intimated that he had an important communlcation to make to the Court. Mr. BEAiDo took Mr. Defries into his private room, and, after a short conference, the prisoner was remanded untU the day fixed for the further examination of the other prisoners WEsnNsTEsR-John Usher, a private in the Greudler Guards, was charged on Monday with the folowing out. rages. Mary Ann Watkins, an unfortunate woman, living in Cottage.court, Orchard-street, Westminster, stated that on the previous night, between 12 and 1 o'clock, she was in bed, and upon hearing loud and long continued screaming from the room beneath she went downstairs to the door of the room whence the cries proceeded, and was standing there when the accused openedthe door and struck her a desperate blow in the month, which knocked her down and rendered her insensible. No words had been exohanged between them, nor had she given the defendant any provocation. Jane Morgan, another woman, corroborated this statement. Eliza Clayton, another woman of the same unfortunate class, said that she was drinking at the King's Head, Orchard-street, on the previous evening, and saw the defendant there. When she left she found the defendant following her, and he rushed after her into her own room, and treated her in the most atrocious and disgracoful manner. She screamed repeatedly whenever she was able, but he put his hand upon her mouth at different times and prevented her making any noise. She struggled and resisted as long as she was able, but he at length got the better of 'her. He kicked and beat her in the L.ost shocking way, as it would be proved if her body was examined, and she now produced her dress, which was torn to pieces, to show the violence of the struggle which had taken place. Mr. AisrcOLD inquired whether he understood rightly |that all had occurred against her will and consent. The reply of the woman indicated that it was not only so, but was attended by circumstances that heightened the nature of the offence. Thomas West, 53 B, said that at 1 o'clock that morning he heard sereams of "M Murder" and " Police" from Cottagecourt, and on proceeding there the defendant was pointed out tohimas aprson who had committed a very violent assault. He found the first woman, Watkins, lying in the passage insensible, with her mouth severely cut and a large pool of blood on the floor in front of her. EHe sent defendant to the station, and conveyed her to the hospitaL In answer to questions from the MAGISTRATE, witnesssaid that the defendant was a little under the influence of liquo-, but -well knew what he was about. The woman Clayton was intoxicated; the other was not. He examined Clayton's room, which bore every appearance of a severe struggle having taken place there. One end of the bedstead was down on the ground, and the place was in greatc disorder, as was al8o Clayton's dress. Many persons wrere round the door of the house, attracted by the woman Clayton's screamsw One of the witnesses said that the screams were heard for nearly an hour. Mr. ARNoLD remanded the accused until Saturday, and dirctted the police to make the fuUest inquiry into the matter. WOnsuip-sTREFT.-Edward Jackson, au oil and colourman in Leonard.street, Shoreditch, and Anne Jackson, his wife, were charged on re-examination before Mr. D' EnYCOlJRT with being found in felonious possesaion of numerous valuable articles of wearing apparel, the property of the Countess of Ellesmere, and stolen, with a portmanteau containing jewelry and other property to the aggre ate amount of about 15,0001., from her Iadyship's traveling carriage, during her progress from Cleveland-square, St. James's, to Windsor. on a visit to Her Majesty. There have been five remands of tbis ca-se in the whole, such difficulties have the officers experienced in tracing the stolen property and the prisoners' conuexion with i'. The first three, which have already been published, were occupied with the prodaction of what stolen articles have as yet been discovered and their identification by Lady BUesmere's servants and tradesmen, and it now remained to prove the male prisoner's reception of the stolen proparty, his soHcitor, Ar. Lewis, being instructed to deny that he had the slightest personal knowledge of it, When Jackson was taken he was found in possession of a large pac'kage of new ribands and neckties, suspected by the oflicars to form part of the produce of another robbery in the city, and for which Jackson accounted by stating that they had beeuintrustedto him for sale by a man named Woodford, at Bethual-green, but where Woodford resided, or what Woodford was, he professed not to know. Tbe police therefore tet to work to trace Woodford, if possible, and Sergeant Evans, who had the conduct of the case, stated, -I have since made persevering Inquiries after this man Woodford, who is all.ged by the male prisoner to have given him this part of the property, and find that Woodford is now undergoing 12 months? imprisonment for reeeivlng Etolen goods, ho boing by trade a clockmaker.

One man ahook hands with the other and went away, and the other man on reashine Fnabury -square told me to go dowtn Leonard-street and pul up at a beershop In Leonard-square and have some beer. I did so, and the man who rode with me then got tho trunk out on to his shoulder, went down Leonard-street with is, and then crossed ever. It is so long since I don't think I could recognize that man now, and I don't tbink I have seen the mcale orisoner before. 1 suspected something wrong when I took the man np, but he offered to stand beer, and I then did not. Directly I heard of the robbery I gave information to the police, describing the box as twro feet wide and three feet long, and I saw the same box directly after it was Thomas Geary.-I live inAntelope gardens, nearLeonaydstreet, and found this box between 7 and 8 in the morning in a garden near my house, with its lock broken and two of the buckles fastened, and but a short distanco from the house of the prisoner. Eliza Parsons, a widow. -I have washed for Mrs Jackson and seen some very expensive articles in her pos.4ession, such as handkerchiefs with lace on them. I think I have seen this one now shown me, and also one with a much deeper lace. I have eeen them from a year to 18 months back. (A frock was handed to the witness.) I have seen this often- It was made about a twelvemonth ago for Mrs. Jackson's nbab Sergeant Evans.-This forms part of a dress which was sworn to by the Coantess's s6erants at tho last examination. Perhaps, Sir, yoa will ask her if she ever saw any diamonds ? Witness,-Yes, I have seen Mrs. Jackson with two diamonds; she showved them tome; they rwere like a button, very splendid, and had a point upwards. Sbe told me a gentleman had sent them to her from Australia. Inspector Brecknelt-Will you ask her, Sir, about a tea- Witness.-When her husband had been taken by the pohoe about a tab of batter, Mrs. Jackson asked me to take care of a teakettle. In the kettle were two watches and a lot of rings and other things,and some silver sDoons. A little long jewel-box was also gtven me beside the kettle. It 'was a bright copper kettle. I had them about ten days, and then returned them. I was accused, as I was told by a neighbour, of keeping back one ot the rings when I returned Ihe things. There were lots of rings in the kettle. I don't know If they were valuable, but they hadpearls. red stones, and such like in them. (Two paste dimonds were here produced and shown to the witness.) No, these are not, those I Eaw- they were qite different-larer, and much better eut tnan these. (A Brnels lace shawl was here shown to thewitness, andwhlch wras sworn to at the preceding excamination as the property of Lady Ellesmnere.) After the last examination Mrs. Jackson told me she should wvant me to come here and state that I had seen this shawl in her possession five years ago, but I told her I conld not do so, for I had not seen it at aLl Sergeat Evans -On discoveringher Ladyship's lace veil at the risoner's house, in a chest of drawers in the bed room, Ehe femalo prisoner said it belonged to her before her marriage, and had been given to her by her mother. The black lace shawl, since sworn to, I discovered in a box, with some man's clothes, which she said were her husband's. That the female prisoner said she had had from a woman who lived with her sister in the HamDstead-road. The drab dress, also now produced and sworn-to, she claimed as one of her own, and said she had had it cut up that it might mnake frocks for her children. The female prisoner, wrho was constntly in tears, Is near her confinement, and was therefore allowed to be seated, She denied this part of the officer's statement, and Mr. Lewris, who cited numerous case, contended that she could not be sent for trial, as the husband alone, if either of them, was answerable for the offence. Mfr. D'EYCOURT, however, thought differently; the evidenco certainly now pressed closer upon the woman than before, and he should Increase her ball to two suretiesin 501. eah. Sergeant Evans opposed the man's being liberated upon baDl, as there wzas a vast amount of propert still unrecovered, and if he were free the police wo%ld bave but small chance of recovering it. Tho magistrate, however, increased Jackson's ball to four In 50C. each, which he could not find, and he was therefore yesterday brought up in custody, the wife surrendering to her bail. Sergeant Evans, after a conference with the Bench, now said,-I must apply, Sir, foranother remand, as I have most Important evidence to prodoce, and if I produced it now I should entirely frustrate the ends of justice. I may also state that since the last examination I have been to the prison at the request of Jackson, mad he then told me that as he had a wife and children he wanted to look after them, and he acknowledged that the stolen box had been brought to his house at night-time. Mr. Lewis.-I object to any private communication being made to the magistrate by the officer. We ought to know what It is. Mr. D'EYv;couRT.-In consequence of what has now come to my knowledge I shall refuee any ball for the male prisoner at alL The wife's ball may be extended to the next exa.mination, The female prisoner's bail was therefore again accepted, and she was liberated, while her husband was again locked up. SoruTUTwAn-Charles Wash, a young man of respectable appeaanace, was charged writh embezzling the som of 51. 12s. 7cL, the money od his employers, MIessrs. Hepburn and Co., tanners and fellmon gers, Lon g.lane, Berm on dasy |and sentenced to six months' hard labour in the House of Correchion, Two very fine looldng coloured girls, about 18 or 20 years old, were brought before Mr. BURCHAMA for further examination, charged with begging in the public streets. The prisoners, who were weol conducted, and apparently of good education, were seen on Saturday evening walking along the side of the kerb in Blackman-street dressed in white. One of them carried a box, and the other a placard on which was written "Fugitive Slaves." 85 M, seeing several persons put copper money into their box, took them Into custody for begging, and when before Mr. ComBIB on Saturday evening they were remanded until to-day, in order that Inquiries might be made about them. The elder prisoner, an inteligent and good-looking woman, said that they were fugitives from Kentucky. They were born and brought up on a plantation, and about 12 months ago their father died. Their mother was sold to another distant planter, and they were about to be parted and sold also,whentheysucceeded in getting awayto PhUadelphia. Tbere they were taken care of by a benevolent person, and through the kindness of some free coloured persons tbere their passage was paid to Greenock. where they arrived last spring. They tried to get into domestic service, but beln unable to obtain situations there they made their way to aondon. Here they were equally unfortunate, and at tho present timo witbout the means of subsistence. They had lived lately along wlth a labourer and his wife named Flynn inm court in Bishopegnte-street, and gained a few pence by seiling tracts. rZ. BunCEAWr asked whether inquiries had been made as to the trnth of their story. The constable replied that they had, and he bad reason to believe that it was true. Two officers of the Mendicity Society, who were in attendance, also informed his Worship that they were not known as beggars. 3ir. BuRHAx asked them what they were able to do for a, living. The elder girl roplied that they were both domestic servants, but people objected to them in such situations in this country owing to their colour. They were, however, able to knit gloves. Mr. BumcsRAm told them that knitting gloves would be much better than begging, which was not allowed in this country. He would advise them to knit somo and sell them. The cold weather was coming, and no doubt they would get a ready sale for them. They expressed their wllingness to do so, provided they had the means to obtain the wooL Mr. BuRcHA.m told them that If their story was true there was some commiseration for them, aud he did not think they were actual beggars. As they seemed willing to obtain their livelihood by their own labour, be would assist them in purchasing wooL A shilling was found on them, and he should direct 4s. to be added to it from the poor-box, end he hoped with that they would be able to earn their own subsistence. He earnestly exhorted them not to be led away by bad women, and avoid the streets of London. The poor girls, who listened attentivoly to his Worship, promised to comply, and thanked him earnestly for the assistance he had so kindly rendered them in a strange country They thought they should be able to gain a good living by glove making. Mr. BuxcRC}Aex received 6s. in postage stamps for Georg Akppa, a poeer man who lost the sight of one eye and nearly that of the other tbrough violence inflicted on him about nine months ago by James Williamson. Mr. Cozss has also received a 51.-note, No, 85727, for the poorbox of the court. ILAMXEMIL-Edward Grant, a journeyman bricklayer, was brought before Mr. ELLnOrr on remand, charged with committing a very brutal assault on George Carpenter, who Is also a bricklayer, breaking his leg in two places and also breaking his thumb. From the evidence adduced in the case it appeared that on Saturday night week the injured man Carpenter was at a publichouse at the Marsh.gato, and on going out for a necessary purpose he was folowed by the prisoner, knocked down, and violently kieked, and when released from his violence it was discovered that his leg was broken in two places, and when carried to the hospital it was found that his thumb was broken also. Jesse Cannon, 69 L, the constable who has the case in hand, produced a certificate from the hospital to the effect that the injured man is not yet in a fit state to attend and give his evidence, Mr. ELLIOTT, after a lengthened examination, again remanded the prisoner for a week to give time for the attendance of the injured man Carpenter. Mir. ELLIOTT requested the acknowledgment of a Postoffice order for 5s., the first month's instalment of is. a- week from "A. Devaine" to the fund for the benefit of Hugill, the poor old brower, and also two guineas to the poorbox from " J. G. F." W,AmSWORTH.-Henry Zacariah Jervis, a stout, portlj man, about 50 years of age, who described himeelf as a solicitor, of 62, Newman-street, Oxford-street, was brought before Mr. INrofl for final examination on the charge of obtatning moiaey from Mrs. Sarah Parker, a widow of a member of the Stock-Exchange, aged 70 years, who was alleged to be Insane, by means of false representations.

AN IwDIhN SxIRnrasH.-A friend, at Meerat sends the following, dated Sept. 19 :-" At midnight on the 17th Major Stokes and LIeutenant Armstrong, with 210 Affghan and JMooltan Horse, accompanied by Captain Cragie, with about 100 Irregclar Cavalry, went out on a secret expedition along the Delhi road. At sunrise on the following morning they surrounded the village of Mooradnuggur, about half-way between Meerut and Delhi, whero the enemy's cavalry had established themselves in forceo Secretly as everything was arranged the enemy were not completely taken by surprise. Some 20D of themwere readymounted outside thevillage, andtheremainderdefendedthe placefrontheinslde. However, after hard fighting, the enemy wero defeated and driven OCu of the vilage and the place burnt, but not untJil 57 of their number were cut up and several taken prisoners. Our people had nine killed and wounded; among the number I am sorry to say, was Iaeutenant George Armstrong, who received three severe sword outs, but is doing well. His gallantry was conspicuous throughout the affair. The man who cut him down was kiUled by the jemadar of the Affchan troop. Thus ended a very successful cJhupan, in w ich the isnnurent cavalry were taught a severe lesson. A very gallant fellow named Peettee Singh, formerly in the 11th Native Infantry, has been, I fear, mortally wounded in this affair. He is the man who saved Mrs. Shelly's life the night of the Meerut outbreak, and hbo since been promoted to a high grade in Oraigie's New Horse, where he has done good service. Lieutenant Armstrong was conveyed to the Rifle Hospita at Meerut. He is suffering from three sabre cuts-one on the arm, one on the forehead, and one on the scalp.

The Hamnburg ship La Rochelle, which was off Falmouth en Monday, reports that in lat. 7 N., long. 24 48 W., sho gpoke the steamship Hydaspes, from London for tho East Indies. The troops (artillery) were aU well at that pelod, 3ud were three and a half days from St. Vincent's. She also reports Oct. 10, lat. 10 24 K., long. 23 48 W,, seam troop. Ahip Italian, from Cork for Bombay, having on board 201 snen of the 15th and 26th Foot. The Hydaspes left Wool. wrish Sept. 17, and the Italian left Cork Sept. 25. Yesterday a draught, comprising about 120 men, left CAchester camp to join their respective regiments in India. They comprised 60 men of the 2d battalion Rife Brigade, 30 men 3d battalion Rifle Brigade, 15 of the 1st ibattalion of 60th Rifles, and 16 men of the 54th Foot. The men, who were accompanied by one sergeant and two corporals, and under the command of Captain Mwaguire, of the 60th Rifles, embarked the same day on board the clpper transport George Marshall, lying off Gravesend, and bound for Bombay. Owing to the crowded state of the camp, and the inability of the rifle instructors at tho branch camp at Clacton to prepare a sufficient number of =en for active service abroad, upwards of 200 men have ibeen removed to Harwich and Languard Fort, where a staff will be temporarily kept to relieve the Artillery under orders for India, and also for the purpose of assisting to train the young recruits, who now form an important part of the camp, In the use of the rifle. Major-General lawrence bavlng returned to Aldershott, the command has ibeen assumed by Lieutenaut-ColonelDixon. Large numbers of recruits continue to come into the camp, which maynow be said to be in a satisfactory condition. Owing to tho great increase In the strength of Chatham garrison, consequent on the large arrivals of recruits for the purpose of joining the vaidous Indian dep6ts attached to the provisional battalione, the authorities are making arrangemnents for the embarcation duzing the ensuing month of about 1,000 troops, with a proportionate number of officers from the following Indian depOt companies quartered at Chatham garrison-viz., 7th (Fusileers), 8th (the lKings), 10th, 18th (Royal Irish), 19th, 20th, 23d (Royal Welsh Fusileers), 24th, 27th (Enniskillens), 29th, 32d, 35th, 43d (Light Infantry), 51st (Light Infantry) 52d (Light Infantry), 53d, 618t, 64th, 70th, 75th, 81st, 82d, 83d, 84th, 86th, 87th (Royal Irish Fusileers), 90th (Light Infantry), 94th, and 98th Regiments. Great activity prevails in the garrison in bringing the men forward for embarcatlon, and about 200 troops are daily undergoing Instruction in the use of the Mini6 rifle. The Union Screw Steamship Company's mail packet Norman, Captain Boxer, left Plymouth on Sunday for the Cape of Good Elope.

BIRMINGH&M, Nov. 17. The commercils panic has at length affected South Stat. fordshire. Up to yesterday credit was, as far as ontward appearauces went, maintained, but this morning the doors of the Wolverhanpton and South Staffordshire Banking Company were closed, and the suspensionl of Messrs. Riley and Son, in the iron trade, announced. The latter firm attribute their failure to want of "the usual accommaodation" and the suspension of several firms indebted to them. Their liabilities are estimated at 400,0001. or 500,0001. This is strictly corroborative of the fact we stated last Yhlonday. Four mouths' bills are becoming due and cannot be met. The proprietary of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Banking Company is the wealthiest company in the neighbourhood. The misfortune of the district is that the circumstances of the present crisis have induced suspi. tions against many other houses which are not at present lustified.
HBR1 MAJBSTY'S 9th REGIMEBT OF POOT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As some injurious reports have appeared £n the public papers with respeot to the discipline of this gallant regiment, I trust you will permit me to set the public right by means of the following extract of a letter from an officer in the corps:- "I need not say we never had a mutiny in the 9th when we were ordered home. It is rather too bad to abuse the poor fellows who went through so much because 150 rascals deserted. For their desertion, however, the Government is altogether to blame. The stopp3ges were so heavy that the 3men had not 2d a-day, and that, too, in a country (Canada) where our soldiers3 saw common labourers earning 6s. and 7s. a-day with ease. The temptation was too strong fortheyoung soldiers, mot of whom were Irish Roman Catholics, who had friends an,d relatives all over the States, and so they bolted; but, notwithstanding this, and the grwnbling consequent on Incessant and heavy stoppages, the regiment is in excellent order." I am certain, if we are to have a contented army, that the question of stoppages must be fully considered. Your very obedient servant- bEILES.

IRBIAND. (mBOM OB OWNb COPRMPON]qN1T.) DUBLIN, TuEsDAY MOBtciG. TH 14oNETrY CRMISIS The accounts from all parts of the country speak of the non-subsidence of the ran on the banks, but the demands having in every instance been promptly met, there was hardly at any period the semblance of a panic. The National Bank, with its several branches south and west, was strongly assailed, but the storm wais gallantly weathered, and confidence in its stability was everywhere maintained. The Northern of Belfast, too, belleved to be one of the soundest banking establishments in the three kingdoms, was severely tested during the close of the last week, and also firmly withstood the shock, although the pressrtre from without was said to be far greater than that on any of the other country banks. With regard to the position of the Irish banks generally the fail of Last night has the subjoined satisfactory statement: ".The amount of Government stocks held in 'his country now exceeds by 6,000,0004 that held seven years ago ; and durlng the last six weeks we are well assured publio secu. rities to the amoantof 400,0001. were imported lntoIrelad, and of course paid for. At the same time money Is easily obtainable on deposit of stock at 6 per cent.; private parties are discounting at 7 per cent., and the banks o redolng all ordinar trade bils freely at the Bank of England rate. There has not been a single failure in Dublin connected with the present crisis, but one in Cork, and one or two in Belfast. There has been no run of any moment upon the banks; no panic, nor the bursting of a single bubble company. This is to be accounted for by what the gamblers of the factory towns ill call want of commercial enterprise, but what we consider to be more fitly described as mercantUle honesty, sound principles of banking, and freedomu from illusions." On all bands it is surmised that the beginning of the end has commenced, that the turning point has been reached, and that before the meeting of Parliament all the greater difficulties of the crisis of I 857 wvll have been tided over. The following extract is taken from the trade report of one of the Cork papers (the Reporter of yesterday):- " During the week the Commercial Buildings' room was more than usually crowded, and the successive telegraphs, announcing some new feature in the money-market or some additional failures, were eagerly scanned. Of the many stoppages announced during the week, fortunately not more than one or two can effect any of our local mercantile community, and, as it is generally thought that Messrs. Dennistoun and Co. v'ill be able to pay all the claims on their estate, it is probable Cork merchants will escape without any serious losses. As may have been antioipated, tlhere was a slight run ocasionally during the week on the banks, but it was of & very partial character, and confined to the humbler and more lgnorant classes. The banks here have such ample resources at their command that not only was every demand at onoe met, but not the smallest inconvenience was at any time experienoed by any of their establishments. In fact, the only persons who can suffer any loss or inconvenience are those who h%ve withdrawn the money or got gold, for the banks here can afford to look on such a movement with perfect indifference, if not with satisfaction, as evincing strong proof of their soundness and stability. It is tifyng to observe that at this critical period our local bn, so far from contracting their usual accommodation, have, in many instances, cheerfully assisted their customers who were Inconvenienced by the embarrassments or panic of their English correspondents. Except in one or two instances, Ireland has been completely fiee from mercantile embarrmasments durlng the present crisis." A letter from idmerick, dated Monday night, Eays,- "As anticipated by my communication of yesterday there was a great run on the Provincial and Nationa5l Banks to-day, but it was well and promptly met by both, and before 2 o'clock the panic had almost subsided, confidence being apparently restored. The supply of gold on view at each b vwas iramense. I understand deposits to the amonut of 4,0001 were drawn out of savings-banks, In some Instances relodgements were made by parties in the Provincial Bank." PROSEcCUTION OF T]IE MAYO PRIESTS. The Freeman of this morning contains the following statement with respect to the Government prosecution of the renowned Fathers Conway aad Ryan .- " It was rumoured yesterday that the Crown had directed warrants to be Issued and sent down to the country for the arrest of the Rev. Mr. Conway and the Bev. Mr. Ryan, as no appearance had been entered for them in answer to the ex officio Information filed against them at the suit of the A.ttorney-GeneraL We know not whether there be any Eoundation for the rumour, but it would seem to receive some confirmation from the fact, 'which we have learnt from a gentleman who arrived in this city to-day from Tuam, that a number of troops passed through that town on Sundq en route to Ballinrobe, for the purpose, as was ,enemy believed, of asisting at the arrest of the rev' zentlemen. We have also learnt that a troop of the 1st Dragoon Guards were despatched by special train from the Broadstone terminus, at 7 o'clock yesterday morning for Mthenry, their destination being Ballinrobe, where the Rev. ilr. Conway resides." A correspondent of the samne journal, writing on Monday morning from Athenry, ina the county of Gainr r says: "A rdend going to Dublin wishes me to tell you that a large body of ragoons, over 100 men, passed through oR their way to Ballinrobe to ald some officials in the arrest of the Rev. Peter Conway, to answer the criminal information fled against him in the Queen's Bench. For the last few days it was rumoured in Ballinrobe that the High Sheriff of the county had received a warrant to arrest Father Conway and lodge him in the county gaoL The result was that considerable dissatisfaction began to be apparent, and serious fears were entertained that if the High Sheriff dlid attempt an arrest a riot and, perhaps, bloodshed would ba the consequence. Those rumours having reached Mr. Conway, he quieted the minds of all who spoke with him on thel ub'ect, and assured them that should such A step be resorta to he would at once obey the law, and proceed to Prison if necessary; that he had placed his defence in other hands, and he had no reason to shrink from alegalinvestiga. tion. Buthis assurances had not the desired effect. Deep Indignation was felt at so obsolete and uncalled-for a course of proceeding having been adopted, and Mr. Conway, fearing that he might be the innocent cause of involvin~ innocent eople In not, if not worse, determined on starting for Dubl and appearing n person to answer the charge against him. He accordingly left home yesterday, reached Oran. more Inst night, and left this morning by early train. All this excitement and unnecessary parade might have bsen spared by a line to Mr. Conway that a warrant lay at the residence of some stipendiary magistrate for him. He would at once have given bail, and been saved the annoyance of a journey, and the Government esaped the ridicule they so richly deserve." TM r,TE MURLDER f@ IN BAT. A letter in the morning papers gives the slibjoined shocking particulars connected with the recent murder of Mr. Richard Connel - " An investigation concerning the murder of Mr. Richard i Connel, at Kilskier, which, as already stated, took place on Sunday, the lt of the present month, was held on Friday last. The parties arrested, six or seven in number, are still in custody, but have not been identified. They are remanded for a week. Great excitement prevails in consequence of this diabolical outrage, aggravated as it is by the fact of its havlng been committed at such a time, and in such a place, in the open day, at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, Within view of the chapel, and distant but a few perohes from a publichouse, in which, it is said, a number of persons were. The unfortunate victim was seated on his car, accompanied by his mother and sister, and at a place called the White Cross six savage villains rushed from their concealment behind the ditch tha,t bounds the road, and beat him in such a mianner on the head with bludgeons that he died on the following Friday. One Of the assailants, It is stated, held the horse, 'while the others were doing the bloody deed. The poor motherthrew herself on her mangled andbleeding son, crying for mercy, when the demon holding the horse struck her on he ead, infhlcting a severe wound. The cause of this barbarous atrocity appears to be a mystery, asthe family of Connel are much and deservedly respected, humane and charitable. The young man himself was an extensive tanner, in comfortable circumstances, a good neighbour and employer, and of most exemplary character. It isto be hoped that the Government authorities will use every endeavour to bring the perpetrators to justice." ATTEI) ASSASSINATION. Satnders of this morning publishes the following account of an attempt to murder a medical gentlemn, residing near the city of Limerick "l Limerick, an ionday Nighe -An atrroious outrage was perpetrated on Saturdlay night at Bushy-park R.etreat unon the person of Dr. Peppard, proprietor of the private lun-tic asylum in that locality. Thedoctor with his three daughters had been in Limerick during the day, and traveled home the same evening on their own car, which was driven by a servant. Bushy- park is situated on the banks of the Lawer Shannon,eand o ant about 1S miles from this city. There is a long avenue leading from the road to his residence, and, according to authentic information, it appears that the vehicle had not reached far up the Avenue, when three armed men leaped from behind the hedge fence and seized the bridle reis, immediately ptaying the progress of the horse. It was dark at the time, and while one held the horse the other two fellows rushed to the ide where Dr. Peppard was sitting, dragged him off, and beat him in a most brutal ma1nner with guns The servant man was also pulled from his msat, and treated witlh great severit being baoly maimed in several parts of the bod. Te t young ladies upon the occadson may bebiagined rather than described at seeing their father so cruelly treated. They shrieked aloud for help but the ruffianis did not leave off beating bothx their victim unxti they thought them dead. It appears thae Attack was well plmaund, as the fellows rem'oved a bar gate from oneo of the passages, and placed it on the ground in front of where they lay in wait, with the view of upsetting horse and car, but Providence interposed to avert such a calamity, else the ladies might have been kfied.

Mr. Mateer also preached in several parts of the town, bat especially on the very boundary of the late fghting-ground, in Albert-street, within hearing of the Pound-street 'boys.'

The Bceing Post contains the following statement in reference to the rumoured intention to arrest the Rev. Mr. Conway:- " It 3s quite true that the Dragoons went down to Ballin' robe to arrest the Rev. Mr. Conway, and that there was in that quarter the most intense excitement, leading to appre hensions of serious disturbance. However, Father Conway effectually prevented any reslts of that kind by the prudent and highly creditable course he adopted on that occasion On the arrival of the troops at Athenry the peasantry, hear Ing the object of their visit, used the most extraordinaryexertions to communicate with the rev. gentleinan, and by horse expresses from house to house the distance of 30 miles to Ballinrobe was accomplished ln a wonderfully short time The moment Father Conway heard of the warrant, and knowing the great ezcitement that prevailed round among the pesantry, he at once started for Dublin, taldng the early train from Oranmore. Father Conway appeared in the hall of the Four Courts to-day in excellent spirits, and quite prepared for the State prosecution ordered by the Committee of the House of Commons. The appearance to the indictment on the part of Father Conway was entered this day bya 1r Thomas Higgins, solicitor, Tuam."
THE GREBT EASTERN. Since the first failure vague rumours have always been flyimg about that this maritime township was to be launched In a private and off-hand manuner. Within the lmt few days these reports have assumed such a circumstantial con. sistency, and named not only the day but even the hour at which the operation was to be commenced, that the saspicions of the most incredulous were gradually overcome. Yesterday was the day thus arbitrarily fixed, and yesterday accordingly witnessed the disappointment of many hundreds and eveR thousands of the would. be sightseers. From a very early hour in the morning (many hours earlier, indeed, than it was possible to have launched any vessel at all) the visitors began to arrive aS; the yard from all quarters. The horrid ditchy tracta round Poplar and Limehouse seemed animated, and even the Isle of Dogs wore a cheerful aspect under the unusual influx of vehicles and pedestrians. The lively and intelligent natives of the districts we have mentioned, however, seemed by no means to have fallen victims to the general hoax, and were, as a matter of course, in a proper frame of mind to enjoy the disappointment of those who had. E ach fresh omnibus and cab load of eager spectators therefore wa hailed 'with derisive cheers, and cries of " The Ls3v Athon aint a going," which, though rather obscurely expressed, none were at a loss to understand meant that there was to be no launch that day; and such they found was literally the fact. The doors of the yard were kept rigidly closed, and as admittance was refused to all and the men had most positive orders not to take in cards, the great rush of visitora was effectually excluded. These, after vain efforts to oppose the Cerberus at the gate, betook themselves to neighbouring points of elevation which commanded a view of the yard, and there remained with a patience worthy of a better cause, The river steamboats, of course, were laden to the water's edge with reckless cockneys (for some steamboat companies had actuaUy advertised the launch as positively fixed for yesterday), and all along the Deptford shore was crowded with a coucourse of fog and mud-enduring spectators. Now, It is not in our power to inform our readers when the launch, ar the next attempt at it, wil really take place, but we can at least tell what perhaps may save the public sach a fruitless journey to Miiwall as that of yesterday. Our readers, then, may implicitly depend upon it that the time fixed for the launch will be kept a strict and most profound secret,-that no persons, no matter what their infduence or even coumexion with the corapany may be, will be admitted to the yard on that occasion, and that the first which the general publfc is likely to hear of it at aU is that the vessel Is at last afloat, or that another attempt has been made to move her without success. It is no exaggera. tion to say that every possible precaution Is being taken to keep the time which wiUl be appointed for this next attempt a real secret, and even the workmen'employed in the yard will not know when it is to take place till they actually begin to push the gigantic vessel down the "w ways." Any of our readers who were present at the first attempt on the 2d of this month wlll see the imperative necessity for this secresy being observed. On that occasion the yard was thronged with visitors, who were constantly getting into danger and always getting into the way. It was then ascertained, when too late, that beyond a doubt a great error had been committed in admitting any person at all, while, In consequence of the publcity which the event had oh. tained, the rver was so thronged with steamers crowded down to the water's edge, and halting right in the track which the vessel must have taken had she slipped oft the ways, that it would have been nothing short of down. right manslaughter to launch her under such circum stances. To get rid of all these difficulties, aud most espe. cially the last named, It has been decided, as we have said, to keep the whole matter secret in the strictest sense of the trm. Let our readers, therefore, be on their guard, and turn a deaf ear to the announcements or rumours of the launch, no matter fromwhat quarter they maycome. Allthe preparations for malding the next attempt are ready, and the matter now rests with Mr. Brunel. Directly he perceives that the time and tide have come, the effort to move the ship will be made at a single hour's notice. We may mention, however, that it will not be long delayed, for it cannot be concealed that the launching ways have yielded, and may yield still more under the tremendous weight which bears upon them, and that every week she remaing in her present position greatly increases the difficulty of moving her AT all. During the whole of yesterday the workmen were employed in getting the cables and tackle which is to haul her down towards the river in working order, so as to have everything ready at a moment's notice. Beyond these movements, and that the artistes from the firm of CundaU, How. lett, and Downes, of Bond-street, were employed in completing the beautiful series of photographic and stereoscopic views of the hull and interiors of the engine.rooms, nothing was doing or done to recompense the curiosity of the hundreds who stood gazing into the yard all day.

THE SCOTTISH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Thanking you very sincerely for the honour you have done my Introductory lecture by mentioning it so pro. minently in your columns, I crave the liberty of mAking a few practical statements] tending to show that ths state of our Scottish universi ties in reference to the h1ghest academical learning is by no means so hopeless as your re marks would seem to imply. In fact, the germ of a new life is already visible among us, which, though not brought so prominently before the public, may in time work as complete a chsnge as the recent reforms in Oxford, provided they get fair play. In the first place, alow me to say that It is only certain classes in our universities to which my remark applies With sad truth, that they are compoeed principally of boys, and that the whole style of teaching in these classes, to be effi. dlent, must necessarily be puerile. Our curriculum consists of four years. It is only of the course of study during the first two yean that it can with strict truth be aid that the professor is forced to perform the work of a schoolmaster. Bat, in fact, all our professors, even those who, like myself, teach the most elementary classes, teach also a bigher class, the work done in which is strictly of an academical character. In my highest class, for instance, I teach as high Greek as is taught by any tutor or professor in Oxford. If, therefore, the Scotch professors are, by the necessity of their position, schoolmasters and not professors, it is not all Scotch professors, nor, indeed, any Scotch professor, in the oomplete range of his functions, of which this may be predicated; but the correct description of our Scotch universdty teachers, even in the lowest classes, is that they are both schoolmasters and professors; sometimes the one feature, sometimes the other predominates, according to the genius of the man or the nature of his position. Of many of our professors-Professor Aytoan, for instance-it were an abuse of language to say that they act as schoolmasters in any sense. Again, you seem to regard my notion of a university as a sort of ideal type of perfection, towards the realization of which it is impossible that any practical advance can be made. Now, this is so far from being the case that in Edinburgh a decided practical advance towards putting our university teaching on a hlgher platform has already been made, and further movements in the same direction are taking place every day. It was only last week that the Sena. tus Academlcus, by appointing tutors to each of the four junior classes in this University, made a decided move in the direction to which enlightened academical reformers in Scotland have all along been pointing-viz., a distinct and well-marked separation of the puerile element in our universities from the properly academical element. The municipal body also, who, as you are aware, exercise tho function of academical overseers in this place, introduced, five years ago, an entrance examination in ceonnexion with the Greek classes, the effect of which has been to raise very considerably the standard of teaching even in our most elementary class. In Marischal College, Aberdeen, a dimilar measure had been successfully carried out several years before. But what I wish particularly to direct your attention to is the facb that in this city at the present moment the Edinburgh Academy and the Iligh School are actually performing, so far as Edinburgh boys are concerned, the whole of that elementary w ork which, fifty years ago, was performed by the university; the best practical proof of which great local improvement Is, that while the annualincome of mypredecessor in theGree kohairused toaverage abontl,2001. my income never exceeds half that sum. For with regard to one fact you are perfec tly righb, that the elevatlon of the style of university teaching in Scotland must necessarily be accompanied by a diminution in the income of the professor, which depends in Edinburgh almost entirely on fees. There are always more persons in every country, and especially in Scotland, who create a demand for rudimentary Greek, than those who feel the want of the highest scholarship. But this consideration will not be allowed to interfere with that elevation of the professorial platferm which all the leading inteUects in Scotland now feel to be essential, at once to the maintenance of our position as an educated people and to the true dignity of our Christian churches. A very small sum of money from Government would compensate our professors for the loss of that class of students who, being content with that amount of elementary Greek which is better taught in upper schools, wil cease to pay fees to the holder of the academical chair; and If Government should refuse to grant us aid in this so urgent matter, I have no fear that among a people like the Scotch, who are proud of their educational institations, God wiiU raise up some intelligen' benefactor to give that material basis for further imprevements without which the loftiest ideal aSpirations mnst, in the nature of things, prove ineffectual. In conclusion, allow me to state that I have already laid before the Senatus and the Town-council of this place a financial scheme of the greatest simplicity, which when put into execution will place me and every future Professor of Greek in Edinburgh in a great measure above the necessity of doing merely elementary work. The scheme is founded upon a plan for dividing the work of the Greek casses, at present huddled unmanageably under one professor, between two distinct teachers-one with the nams of tutororreader,confininghimself totheelementary instraction ef the least advanced students; the other-that is, myself-exercising the proper funceton of a professor in stimulating philosophic thought, and in opening up the paths of scholarly research. If matters proceed as they are now doing I have not the slightest doubt that the Scottish universities wiU possess a complete system of academlcal teaching, with the professorial and tutorial elements harmoniously combined, long before the English shall have learnt to reinstate the professorial element in its legitimate place, so long usurped by the tutorial. Al we want in Scotland to render a high scholarship possible is money ; and I see no reason to doubt that the same people who supplied scholarships so liberaUy to the undergraduates of Aberdeen will furnish the whole nulversities of Scotland with an adequate staff of professors, fellows, and tutors, so soon as they clearly perceive where the weak point of our academical system lies. Lnder an imDroved system, while the sons of the poorer and middle classes wil be admitted as freely as at present to all academical advantages, the sons of the rich will find no difficulty in holding high communion with Plato in Edinburgh any more than in Oxford, and both classes of students will rejoice in some of that protection and encouragement which aU tucdies not bearing directly on the interests of practical life so imperatively demand. I have the honoar tn ha Ri. ;, -- JORNT S. BLAmC=lE. Colege, Edinbwugh, Nov. 14.

CIOY COAMISSIO2b OF SEWZRS Yesterday a Court, at whioh Mr. Deputy Christi pro. sided, was held for the deepatch of public busincas. CONSECRATION OF THE NEW CEETRy. The CAnM Bamid, it was his pleasing duty to announce that the ceremony of consecratig the neaw oemetery at Ilford had been performed the day previoua by the Bishop of London. He was quite sure tha everybody present upon that occasion must have been highly grati£odrwith the arragments wfhich the Buial Board inmmittee had made for the convenience and comfort of those who had been invited as spectators of the ceremrony. At the conclasion of the service in the chapel, the bishop proceeded to the stps at Its entrance, and there deliered to the congregation a most excellent address, and one which rivetted the attention of everybody present. (Hear, hear) The bishop had alwvays evinced a strong desire to assist the Co missionin carrying out the objects of the cemetory, and as soon as he bad bea asked to consecrate it he responded to the call. He was, therefore, entitled to the warmext thanLk of the Commisdon. (Hear, hear.) The enineer, Mr. Haywood, and the chief clerk, Mr. Daw, had gLven a great dea of time and labour, and had bestowed much attention on all matters relating to the formation of the oemetery from its Tery commenoement. Mr. BAnsLr said, he had reason to complain of the manner In which the arrangements oonnected with the con. Fecration were conducted. A good many members of the Commisson as well as himself could not get into the ground at all-at al events, not near enough to see what was goIng forward, on account of a oonsiderable number of the Buril Board having friends there. Mr. ABRAHAs sad. it was imposible to please everybody on such an occason as tbat. The Burial Board had done their bewt to afford proper accommodation to all prtieeL The CHAneau?r suggested that it would be well to write a respectful letter to the bishop, thanking him for his address. Mr. AisAwA fully concurred In what had fallen from the chairman with respect to the kindness of the bishop, but doubted whether a letter was a proper means of thank Ing him. He thought they would have to do it in a more substantial mode by and by. Deputy Lorr said, that at the interesting ceremony all the gentlemen not composing the committee were completely nored, not onlyin the programme but infact. (Laughter.) Moldness and good fooling ought to have suggested to thema that their colleagues, as members of the Burial Board, ought to have been better treated. Hle himself was shut out from the chapel after struggling and fighting his way through a dense mob, and was unable to witness the ceremony. In Scotland on oocmions of this nature a deacon-s man noted for sobriety and exemplary conduct-attended and took part in the proceedings. His friend Deputy Bolt actet as deacon yesterday, and sat next the bishop. (Roas of laughter.) He (Deputy Iott) could not see what was going on on account of the uncomfortable, undignified, and un iamons ition in which he was placed. Deputy BoWER expressed his great admiration of the manner in which the bishop addressed the congregption. The address was altogether so wise and so impressive that every Dlssenting clergyman in the kingdom would hare been proud to deliver It. Deputy Lott, no doubt, purposely kept in the background during the performanoe of the ceremony in order that he might find am oppor. tunity of maldng a complaintk which Was his invAriable custom. (Hear, hear.) Mr. H. L TAyLo1i,-I am glad to find that so man people were pleased with the address of the bishop. I should have been st the cemetery yesterday but for a circumstance which lrevented me, and which will prevent me at any future time from visiting it. I allude to the armorLla bearings of our clerk, Mr. Daw. Three jaeldawa form a sort of heraldic devico or bearing which with the worst taste has been placed against one of the houses. These we called the armorial bearings of Mr. Joseph Daw, the Clerk to the Commisslon. So long as they remain there I never wll put my foot inside that place. Iir. Ross said, it was impossible that any great undertaking could be carried out without giving dissatisfation to somebody. Mr. DAw.-I may state that the armorial bearings referred to by Mr. Taylor are not jackdaws; they are) three crosses. (Laughter.) Mr. Ross wished to express his warm approbation of the manner in which the ceremony was performed yesterday. He thought the Court ought to mark their approbation of the conduct of the bishop in distinction to the manner in which the Burial Board was treated by those who acted for his Lordship's predecessor. (Hear, hear.) He therefore moved- That this oommissdon desire to expres their cordial thanks for tbe woCmpt and effectual assitance which the Right Hon. and the Right sr. the Lord Bishop of London has rendered to the Commidocne sdine his appotntment to his high offioe In the removal ot the diffeulies wsht prevented the consecration of the cemetery, and especialy for the able and imprewive manner In which the ceremony of coascrtlon was eterda perfornmed." (Hear, hear.) Deputy CoNmDe seconded the motion. Deputy LoTT, in supporting the resolution, loudly complained that he was not able to hear the sentence of consecrtion. Mr. AnBAHA.-Mr. Deputy Lott was in the foremost rank. Deputy LoTT.-You are stating that which you know is untrue. Mr. AnRAHAM.3-You were. Deputy Lorr.-I deny it. (Confusion.) Mr. ABBAHA3L-I witnessed it with my own eyes. Mr. Deputy Lott was present in the chapel during the whole of the first stage of the prooeedings for more than half an hour, until we went out to perambulate the grounds. He might have read the sentence of consecration; it was printed. Deputy LoTr.-I had a right to be inside to hear it. Mr. ABRAiAm.-You were standing within a few feet of the bishop. Deputy Lorr.-That's wholly untrue. (Confusion.) The CiiuuR.t,l here interposed, and said it had been the anxious desire of the oommittee to do everything in their power to accommodate everybody. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DE JERSEY begged to express his serse of satisfaction at the proceedings yesterday, and with the valuable and impressive address of the bishop. (Hear, hear.) It was calculated to do much good, and it ought to have left a very strong imnpression upon the minds of all who heard it. It did credit to both the head and the heart of the bishop. He very much regretted to find from the painful discussion that had taken place that the bishop's address bad produced very little effect upon some of the members of the Coart. (Hear, Deputy Lomr-Mr. De Jersey has made an attack upon me ch I repudiate with utter scorn. (Laughter.) The motion was put amid a considerable deal of confusion and carried unanimously, and the chief clerk was ordered to send a copy of it to the Bishop of London. Deputy HARRIsoN said, th at the engineer to the commission, Mr. Haywood, had not only designed the cemetery but carried the works out to the satisfaction of every member of the Court. Mr. Daw, the chief clerk, had likewise during the formation of the cemetery had a vast amount of labour imposed upon him in addition to his ordinary duties. He thought it right thAt it should be referred to the Improvement Committee to consider in what, if in any way, the additional valuable services of these two gentlemen should be recognizod. (Hear, hear.) If the Court would permit him he would make that motion at once. Ir. H., L. TAYLOR.-I shall object to the motion being made, not only now, but on any future occasion. Deputy HARRSoN.-Then I wiU not bring it forwrd now; I will consult some of the members of the Court upon the subject, and give regular notice. (lear, hear.) THE SANITARY STATE OF TEE CITY. Dr. LEviexaY, the Medical Officer of Health, presented his report of the state of 230 houses that had been inpected since the last meeting of the Court, and he sunb mltted a list of 63 places that required the orders of the Commhsion for their sanitaryimprovement. The report says:- "The mortality tables for the lwt two weeks show a large Inree in the proDortion of deaths, and this is due to the unfavourable injuiencee of the weather at thia season of the year. The numbers hare rLeDn from 45. which was the weekly death-rate at the begano autumn, to 73 and 69. The principal Inmrease has been ln the East loondon Union. where the vreekIy proportion has been nearlytreble, for It has advanced from 1i to 31. The total number ot deth, in the city durmng the fcrtuight wa 142, of which 73 were males, and 69 femalem. The totst numberf for the oorreponding periods of last year and the year before were e. and 116, The mortality Is therefore In escex ox Ihe average. 54 of the deaths oxcurred among ehildren of lss than five years of age, 34 among persons ot from 6 to 40. 23 from 40 to 60, and 31 at 60 and upward,. The chief causes of death were diases of the respiratory organs, These have boen fatil In 58 eas, as thus:-bronchltls, 50 -phthids, 18 ;pueuniona, 10; whooptngcough, 5; pleurisy. 4; and larngItIs, L. Diarrhoa^ has nearly diaDpeared, and tbere were but two deaths from fever. Smallpox bas been fatal in C caser, 3 of which occurred intheFastLondon Union,andtheseis a return of one death from cholera and fever. " I have made inunirlea into the prticlan of this csae, und aind that It was Improperly registered, for It was not a case of cholera or fever, but of d arrhr, I an old woman of 66 years of age. It ocrred in Gravel-lane, Houndadltch, whicb is a crowded and lose loeaUty. and the report of ItIn the Eegitrar Gsnerars returwa likely to excie unneoerarnlarm in thepubaiomind. Dr.Yowler, cf Bfibopsgate.treet, Who is the medical ofdoer for that district, hba informed me that, although he attended the case, he wa not applied to for a oerticatoe of the cause of death: if he had been he would have retned It s a ease of diarrhom ; tor, to quote from his letter to me on the subject, he says, I during my attendacos I perceived no symptoms whbateer of typhoid fever,' and I do not oonsider the iymptoms much as to entitle the ese to the name of c cholera," The collapse was nomore.than was te be expected from unchecked disrhbca at that ale. When I last cay the patient there were no fordble elections of the cotents of the bowels and stomsah, no wuppreralon ef urine, no serere cramps, no imperceptible pulso, no sholerae lI idi,ty no ex. tremely cold tongue ; In fact, the hoarse and feeble voIce was the only sumpicIous symptom. I may also mention that the stethescope detected tbore moit "riles" so frequently found at the bore of tbe lungs of the aged-a condUion of thiog by no moens mnereafng the ch oce of recovevIasrnln rPiert ween in the Eeglatsar-Gener's woeekly retura how the death had been ' It i scarcely necoessary forme to say that at the Present time, whenthe alarm tor the aDproach of cholera is Dressing heaIlly on the public mInd every precaution should be taken by those who furnh a erhacate3 of the cause of death to give very accurate and faithful relurns of FSau case as this, because, while oa one hand there Is great danger in needleis feer, so, on the other, It is of the utmost importance that eary inforMation shoula be recelved of the actual approach ot the disease. " As rogards the subject of reference from a fOrmer Court-namoly, that I should Inquir Into the reported outbreal. of disease in Fleetlane and asertain whether it had any connWxion with the lai,Cg open of tbo sewer in that locality, I hlave to report that I have made careful Inquiry Into the fats of the matter, and beg to submit themn to 5eU. "OD the 291h of June last the swer in Fleet-lane was opend for thepurpaee of maklngewinoerWer along the lane from the Old Bailer to Zarngdon.ttreet, and from that time to the 30th of October the ground wras open. A might be expVeted the nhbabitants have suffered great annoyancefrom thebal melt o Uths sewer gases sad have complained of it In tbs most fosoibe languge. But. your engineer ltelyou, everybprecaution hA beentaken to guard aginst the escaeof those gase, and the rwork has been expedited with alt fpeed compatiblewith publbicsaety, for the enineering difficulties of oo. tructiug a deep sewer insa bed of running sad have boee great. Fleetlane is a narrow street of 51 house Thee house re inhabited by about 140 poor faiie, and in almost every houe tbere hare been diarrhcea andlow fever, which the lamates attribute to the toul gases from the sewer. In hoes there hvTe also been t s sarlet fever, and emallDox Alte the locaityhasbeenifete with disease to a considerable extent, Mr. oss. ho il the medical cHaeer for the distr, h Informed me that he ha his elf attended 26 cas ot fevr, 6 of nslpox, ad a large amount of diarrhboa In Fleet-lane and the aoinig court. Re hasnodoubi that the sckumes was caused br the sewer gass £y owa opinion is that they tend to lower the italpowers,an d thus to reuder the hodys u. ceptible of disease. They ao met up a peculiar ymotlo or putrid actIon in the animal eonomy, and cause low fever and intrsctable diarebma, for these are to be mn in every localty where thewer pae espeinto the ainsoqihere. The quetion ot thadis hl sot thesegaes Is DOwV under consideration by your engineer Dnd, m1d Ihavemade anumberof analsesf thesewerproduct In the bos e that X may soon be enabledI to sugest to ou a ^mens whereb the injurious effects ot these gases may be kept snider and whe myin quirles are prosecuted to the enod I shl durdnt the result to ion if r c on siderati on." r[le Court thou adjourned.
