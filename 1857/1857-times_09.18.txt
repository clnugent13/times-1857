MVONAY-MAKM.T and CITY INTLLIGfNCP. Thtursdy Evening. The English funds opened at the final prices of last evening, but on the publication of the news from Calcutta the tone of the market became weaker. Consols for money first ranged between 9d0i and 90k, and the last official transactions were at 90k to i for money and 901 to j for the account. After regular hours there were sellers for the account at 90g. The announcement that General Havelock, after having proceeded about half way to Lucknow, had been obliged to fall back to Cawnpore to provide for a number of sick, that the ambuscade of the Dinapore mutineers at Arrah had resulted in the destruction of more than 200 of our men, that it had been found necessary to proclaim martial law in the adjoining district of Behar, and that atCalcutta, in preparation for the approach of the Mohurrum, which would take place on the 22d of August, ten days after the departure of the present mail, it was deemed essential to disarm the Governor's body guard, consisting of troops hitherto selected for their good conduct, all tended to create anxiety and depression. The belief, however, is still warranted that General Havelock's return movement wiUl not be found to have caused an extra delay of more than a few days in the relief of Lucknow, and that meanwhile the advance of the Nepaulese contingent, stated at 3,000 men, wiU have afforded some protection to the place. Money in the Stock-Exchange to-day was not in excessive demand, and the rate was 5 per cent., but in the discount-market and at the Bank the inquiry was very active. A transaction took place fn Bank Stock after the half-yearly meeting at 218 with dividend. Tndia Stock was quoted at 2If to 212; India Bonds, 23s. to 16s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to 3s. discount. In the foreign stock-market the transactions have been limited, the only important change being a further reduction in Turkish. Russian Five per Cents. were -negotiated at 109; ditto, Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 98# ; Spanish, for the account, 40Q; Turkish Six per Cents., 95k; and Dutch Foar per Cent. Certificates, 100. The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening failed to arrive, but some transactions took place shortly after the opening at 6Gf. 50c. for the end of the month, showing continued flatness. At the same time Crddit Mobilier shares were quoted 710f.-a further decline of 40f. The position of the Bank of France does not improve, and they have lost bullion during the past week. At Vienna the market remains without recovery, but at Hamburg there is less pressure, the rate of discount having receded to 5i per cent. Another illustration has been given of the mode of management which meets the approval of British sbareholders. At the meeting of the North of Europe Steam Company on Tuesday it was virtually resolved not to institute any particular inquiry as to the course by which the property of the concern had been hopelessly squandered. It was known that the company had been formed about five years previously with a capital of 500,0001., that it had paid large and regular dividends, that the reports of the directors had been of the most brilliant description, and that in the midst of this the discovery had taken place that the management had been solely confided to one person without the slightest supervision, that the directors, when they declared dividends and tempted the public to purchase, had never had the slightest knowledge whetber these dividends had been earned, that for months they had closed their ears to adverse reports which were everywhere current, and that a few weeks before the final announcement that the company was ruined they had assured a deputation of the shareholders that everything was perfectly sound, that not a shilling had been distributed, except otut of profits, and that a remark which had been publidy made with regard to the necessity of inquiry was to be denouncea as a most unjustifiable attack. But the impoverished proprietors were disposed to submit to their fate. A committee of consultation had been appointedpersonal connexions of the chairman were chiefly selected for the duty-and when this committee reported that of the capital of 500,0001. about 200,0001. had been utterly lost, and that the remaining 300,0001. was represented merely by vessels which would fetch but a smaU portion of their cost, the directors intimated that they had certainly been so far in fault that they had undertaken duties w-ihich they did not know how to perform, and the ceremony terminated by a vote of thanks being tendered to them for their explanations. This was the result of the firat meeting. At the subsequent meeting, held on Tuesday, new directors having meanwhile been appointed, a few shareholders had resolved that the matter ought not to be allowed to pass so quietly. They had apparently no personal motives, they were quite willing that the plea of the directors should be received for what it was worth, and that there should be no attempt to annoy or persecute them, but they felt that these gentlemen were bound, for their own sakes, to encourage every inquiry that might tend to clear up any doubtful points, and to establish beyond aU quastion that, although they had damaged those who trusted in them, the offence had, at all events, been involuntary. It was desired, therefore, that a thorough examination should be made into the history of the concern-the mode in which the first ships were taken over at a valuation from another company-the nature of the contracts under which the remainder were built-the facts connected with the retirement of Lord Yarborough, who had acted as chairman until about a year before the catastrophe, but who had sold his shares and abandoned the concern on account of ill-health, as was then said, although it is now affirmed to have been because certain traffic arrangements in colnexion with other interests had not been carried out, and a variety of other matters. But the demandamet with nothing but discouragement, and the subject may now be looked upon as dropped, unless the late chairman, or any of his colleagues, should condemn as injudicious the conduct of their friends by whom the disposition for investigation has been stifled, and insist that not a single shareholder should demand information in vain. Meanwhile let the public fairly recognize the system which during the last six months has in this and numerous other instances been proclaimed to the world as that which may be safely encouraged with regard to joint-stock undertakings. In the instance of the Great Western Railway we have seen a property avowed by its directors to be among the finest iD the country brought to a point at which it is doubtful if a dividend of 1 per cent. per annum can be safely paid; and when this discovery is made not only are thos who worked the mischief unanimously selected for future confidence, but 5,0001. is presented as a gift to the gentleman who is described as the guiding spirit of the whole concern. Again, in the case of the Great Northern line, the appointment of a gambler who had already robbed his employers to a position of the highest trust, the total neglect of all indications of danger, and the proceedings of the secretary, who signs bundles of dividend warrants without inquiry, are met by the highest mark of confidence any proprietary can begtownamely, the transmission of their proxies to those who have thus acted, and also by direct intimations from some of the largest shareholders that they " approve of all that has been done." Indeed, in such cases shareholders seem to act upon a kind of scale. When, as in the case of the Great Northern, a company has merely been exposed to a robbery of about 200,0001., and the dividend merely of one half-year is lost, the reward to be expected is nothing less than a perfect snction, the shareholders implicitly placing their votes in the hands of the directors, to pass any resolution their modesty may permit. In a case like that of the Great Western, where the dividend is broaght down to a doubtful I per cent., the testimonials of satisfaction, although still strong, are somewhat modified. The directors are continued in office as tho fittest m%, and the aacretaryis presentedwith a xobl& douceur, bat tban =.pliments are qualified.; the nomination of a few independent and unpaid share. bolders to help the paid directors in their work. In the eNorth of Europe Steam, where the question is not one of suspended or reduced dividends, but whether anything can be saved out of a general wreck, we come down merely to a vote of thankh for the explanations as to the manner in which the result was I,rought aboult. Whether there is any kind of mismanagement short of some direct breach of legal technicalities which would fail to draw forth even ihe slightest expression of favourfromaassem blage of shareboldera is a point to be discussed by the curious in such matters. The Australian Agricultural directors, it is believed, were allowed to retire without any especial mark of approbation, and, if so, as that undertakng was by no means brought to complete ruin, they may fairly complain. The moral of thevwhole is that there is no breach of duty short of an infringement of the statute law which the servant of any company can commit without being able to point to the fact that the wealthy clames of Great Britain bave not merely tolerated, but emphatically sanctioned much greater lapses on the part of those whom they select for positions of example and controL Whether this is a healthy sign in a commercial country is a consideration to be determined. Doubtless, when a person through want of tact has brought himself within the meshes of the criminal law, the public are ready to fall upon him without compunction. He has made a mistake which is worse than a crime, and must bear the consequences. If Paul and Strahan had know. a little of criminal Jurisprudence their career might have terminated with the usual vote of sympathy awarded to all speculators who fail for a sufficient amount to entitle them to such distinction. In the case of the British Bank, likewise, there is similar eagerness for retribution. Yet among the directors who are about to be brought to trial there are some against whom the only charge is that they failed to make known the calamity they had discovered. They did not wholly neglect their duty or assure a deputation that everything was right. InI the interests of the shareholders they worked according to their capacity to disentnvgle th e fraud that had been going on, and to check the continued payment of false dividends; but they endeavoured to temporize, and allowed the shareholders and their customers to remain in the dark as to the actual state of the concern, idly hoping that by shift and accidents they might still work through; for that offence, such as it was, it is proper they should be called to answer; but it may be questioned whether the energetic virtue of the community as manifested againstthese persons harmonizes exactlyvwith the examples encouraged in other instances, and whether it does not appear as if society were trying to make a satisfactory average by their severity in some cases and their laxity in others. The half-yearly Court of the Proprietors of the Bank of England was held to-day the Governor, Mr. Sheffield Neave in the chair. The dividend recommended was 6 per cent. free of income-tax. The profits for the half-year have been 775,6501., making the total of "rest" on the 31st of August 3,840,6251., which, after payment of the proposed distribution, will stand at 3,040,2101. As the dividend is larger than that for the previous half-year a ballot for its confirmatior. will be necessary. At a meeting of the Imperial Brazilian Mining Company to-day, Captain Leicester Vernon in the chair, the resolution to wind up the undertaking, passed at the meeting of the 9th of April, was confirmed. Bv the sale of the property in Brazil a sufficient sum will be realized to return about 31. per share upon the 271. paid. The Red Sea Telegraph Company have announced their inability to raise their proposed capital on the terms they had too hastily accepted. They state that they are prepared to nndertake the task upon amended conditions, which they partly specify. These, however, seem dill to be inadequate, since they contemplate a termination of the guarantee at the end of any two years after the net profits shall have amounted to 7j per cent. Hence, if the communication should fail in the third year, there might be some danger of the shareholders losing the greater portion of their capital. It will be better to demand at once such guarantees as will render the subscription not merely probable, but certain. It appears that the submarine cable lately reported as having been laid down betweenAlgeria and Sardinia has beentemporarilylost, owingto itslength having been insufficient to perfect its landing at Sardinia. The lost end, however, haa been buoyed, and lies at a depth of only 16 fathoms, whence it is expectedto be recovered in the course of a week or two. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company are said to have sent out orders by the last overland mail to their agents for two of their large steamers, one from Bombay and one from Calcutta, to be despatched to Seez, so that they may be available at that port for the conveyance to India either of troops or passengers who may arrive by the overland route. The agents have also been authorized to send home by them, at reuced cost, any sufferers by the mutiny desirous to reumrn. These vessels have been engaged in the transport of troops during the Persian war, and are capable of carying 1,000 men each. The East India-house have chartered another of the vessels of the European and American Company, the Calcutta, an iron screw steamer of 2,300 tons, which rendered good service during the late war. She is now at Southampton, and is to proceed at once to India with troops. It is stated that the New Zealand and Australian Steam Company, mentioned yesterday as having obtained a mail contract, contemplate despatching two screw steamships, of 1,000 tons and 200 horsepower each, for the intercolonial service between Auckland and Melbourne, and two smaller vessels, of 600 tons and 100horse-power, which willdistribute the European mails when they arrive at Auckland, from Melbourne, to the various provinces of the colony. The company also intend to develope some coalfields they possess at West Wanganui for the purpose of supplying their ships. The Sea Star has arrived from Shanghai with 579,0961b. of tea and 1,009 bales of silk.

RusSmo STATiSTICS.-Baxon Reden, a well-known German statistician, has just publisbed some extremely interesting information relative to the increase of the Rusgian National Debt since the year 1842. In 1842 the consolidated debt was in silver roubles 281,228,761; in 1847, 315,084,200 silver rouoes- in 1853, 401,552111 silver roubles; in 1856, 533,273,742 silver roubles;- and in 1857', 521,987,'810 silver roubles. fly the foregoing' figures it will be seen that the iDcreaso of the consolidated debt of Russa in 15 years was 240,759,000 silver roubles, which is 8516 per cent. The "floating" debt in 1847 was 571,251,789 silver roubles; in 1853 it was 778,917,692; in 1856, 1,142,455,179 silver roubles; and in 1857, 1,211,267,654 sUlver roubles. Thus in 10 years the increase of the national debt of Rwtsia-not including the 5 per cent. guarantee for the projected railroads-has been 640,016,000 silver roubles, or 112 per cent. If we estimate the population of Russia at 58,500,000 of souls, nearly 21 silver roubles of the national debt faU on each individual. The average proportion in Austria is IS.i, and in France 47* silver roubles. With her finances in such a pitiable state Russia is not very likely to disturb the peace of Europe for some time to come. It may be observed that the foregoing informatniq. in from official sources,
IRAILWAY AND MINING SHAEIS. Thursday Eyudng. In the railway-market to-day the fluctuations have been rather numerous. The principal feature was a considerable advance in Caledonian, which at one time marked 86, but the highest price was nob fully maintained to the close; Sheffieild and SouthEastern also improved. A decline took place in Great Western, Lancashire and Yorkshire, London and INforth-Western, and Midland; East Indian and Geelong and Melbourne were higher. French shares were heavy, and a reduction occurred in most of the leading descriptions. Lombardo-Venetian were also lower. On the other hand, there was a slight improvement in Dutch Rhenish and Great LuxemDourg. In American, Illinois Central were better, and Michigan Central partially declined. Inimines no important alteration tookplaco. In joint-stock banks, Bank of London and Oriental Bank advanced and Union of Australia were slightly lower. In miscellaneouss&ecurities, an improvement occurred in National Disecount and Peninsular and Oriental Steam.

LONTDON, FRTDAY, SEPTEMB2ER 18, 1857. The news from Calcutta, with respect to that capital and Lower Bengal, may be considered unfavourable or otherwise, according as one looks on the one hand to the danger, or, on the other, to the spirit with which it has been encountered. Not only have two regiments, the one of Native Infantry, the other of Irregular Cavalry, been disarmed at Berhampore, but the GovEnNoR-GENznAT'S own Body Guard have been subjected to the same process, though allowed to retain their horses. Of course, this step mayhave been taken on the most general grounds of caution, without a single new circumstance of suspicion, and simply because the GovERNoR-GENERAL felt himself strong enough to take it. At the lawt previous date only about half-adozen regiments of Native Infantry were still true to us and trusted with arms, aud when the four Native Regiments at Dinapore, after doing good service, had mutinied at the eleventh hour, it was no longer possible to trust the small fragment that remained. These four- regiments had mutinied, apparently against their better feelings, and certainly with small hope of success; and it was to be presumed that the contagion was now too strong to be resisted. Berhampore is one of the firstclass military stations of Bengal, in a populous country, about five miles from Moorshedabad, the Mahomedan capital of the province. As it was in the line of the river communication with the Upper Provinces, it was by no meanus unlikely the 63d Native Infantry and the 11th Irregulars, stationed here, mi,ght follow the example of the M'th, 8th, and 40th Native Infantry and the 12th Irregulars at Dinapore. Patna, which had been kept in order by these last regiments as long as they were true, could no longer be trusted to keep quiet, and the large Mussulman population of Moorshedabad would certainly be tempted to follow a bad example. In the last summing up of the matiny the GovFnNox-GzFNrAi's Body Guard constituted the whole of the regular cavalry in the Bengal Army still trusted with arms. To us at home it was almost incredible that, when no exhibition of confidence, no professions, no actual good service, no consideration whatever had prevented defection, and even atrocities, the GovxaxoR. GmENZL trusted himself and his Council every day tothe loyalty of a native corps. We believe that for the last two months there was not an Englishman in Calcutta who would have been surprised at the worst. It was considered, however, in the first place, politic to show confidence. Then, this favoured corps was composed of distinguished veterans, well paid, well mounted, and altogether as handsome a body of soldiers as could be seen anywhere. They had also good pensions to lose. If it was wise, it was also kind, to take from such men the power of effective mutiny; and that has been done. The GovmRRoR-GENrRAL had just received a presentment from the Grand Jury of Calcutta, and a memorial from the European Residents, urging the disarmament of the native population before the approaching Mahomedan festival, and in reply to this he had undertaken to watch the deposits and sale of arms, and to post throughout the city strong parties of European soldiers fr .ra the regiments arriving. When such precautions were necessary, and 'when aU was to depend upon soldiers dving the duty of police over a fanatical andl excited population, we need not be surprised that the native Body Guard should be put out of harm's way for the time. It is lamentable that HEn M] msTxs 10th Regiment, which had just done such excellent service at Dinapore in the chastisement of the mutineers, sbould have suffered an unnecesary and unprofitable loss by what seems to have been a ioolhardy enterprise. Arrah is a considerable town between the Sone and the Ganges, at no great distance from Dinapore. The case of eight Europeans, besieged there by the mutineers, assisted probably by the population, would be deplorable enough. But war is an affair of calculation, and cannot be conducted with success if we are to run the risk of very great losses for very small resnlts, and results must not be measured by the scale of personal feeling ot a chivalrous sentiment. It would appear tbat a body of about 300 British soldiers, attempting a night attack for the rescue of these Europeans, had fallen, as it is stated, into an ambuscade, and suffered a severe losB; we grieve to say two-thirds of their whole body, 200 men. This is not the enly loss we have suffered by hazardous adventures for inadequate objects. It may not be thought generous to criticize failures when the cry at home has been for more energy and decision; but there certainly is a difference, which those on the spot do not always seem to feel, between an object worth a large sacrifice, with a view to the final success of the war, and one which only appeals to the feelings. In this instance one cannot imagine what 300 infantry were to do without cavalry in the midst of mutineers, including probably a portion of the fugitive Irregulars, and assisted by an insurgent population. A day or two, however, will throw some light on the mystery. Passing up the river, and to the battle-fields on which the hopes of all have just been concentrated, we regret to find that General HAVELOC has found it necessary to pause in his triumphant career. A day's march from Lucknow, encumbered with sick and wounded and heavy guns captured from the enemy, he found his little force attacked by cholera. But for the mysterious character of the disorder, which disclaimis ordinary rules, and selects its victims by an inscrutable caprice, it might be supposed the natural result of that exhaustion and collapse which are to be expected after much exposure, toil, and excitement. However that may be, General HkvLoCr,c has deemed it advisable to retrace his steps to Cawnpore, nurse his sick and wounded, and wait for reinforcements. This is now, as we trust, a question of days. When the Bentinck left Calcutta troops were rapidly arriving, and there would be every day less difficulty in passing them up the Ganges, as fst as the means of conveyance could be found. The delay at Cawnpore is all the less important as an 'unexpected success is reported from Agra, where a mutinous contingent has beenc dispersed, and no doubt is entertained as to the present safety of Lucknow. All along the river, however, there is uneasiness, apprehended outbreaks, and detected conspiracies. Besides Dinapore, Patna, and Moorshedabad, Benares and other towns are mentioned. But, with the Ganges open to us, and troops arriving every day, there does not seem real cause for alarm in this quarter. India, having absorbed the body of the Chinese expedition, has now drawn in the head, and Lord ELGIm has followed his followers to Calcutta, bringing all his staff and a welcome body of Marines and other soldiers. His Lordship may possibly consider that, as in the absence of his forces he can do nothing, he had better go where there is work to be done, or at least something to be seen; and no doubt, at this juncture of unsurpassed difniculty and importance his timely aid and friendly counsels may be found of real value.
The temporary reversa which has befallen General AvELocx and his army detracts nothing from a series of exploits -which form one of the most glorious episodes that even the history of British India contains. The interest attaching to this remarkable march and the brilliant victories by which almost every day's progress was signalized is now heightened by the sad reflection that many of that little bind, which could ill spare even one from its heroic ranks, have escaped the enemy, whom they so often put to rout, only to succumb to the deadliest form of pestilence. It was on Wednesday, the 8th of July, that General HAvELOCK reached Allahabad, from which point we may date the commencement of his more active operations. The main body of the relieving force under his command was composed of the two European Regiments recently withdrawn from Persia-the 64th and the 78th, mustering together about 1,100 or 1,200 bayonets. As he moved upwards, however, from Allahabad he was joined by a smaUl detachment of the Madras Fusileers, which had been pushed on in advance by General Nmu, and which raised his whole force to some 1,300 European soldiers. With these, aided only by 800 Sikhs, he had to traverse a country swarming with insurgent Sepoys, and to encounter immediately an army of exactly ten times his strength, which, in the full confidence of its superiority, had descended from Cawnpore to meet him. This was the force under the orders of 2EK;A SAHIB, and it is not to be forgotten that the mutineers of whom it was mainly made up were troops trained in our own tactics, equipped from our own arsenals, and manceuvring in all respects like ourselves. Nothing, indeed, in the whole of this unnatural contest is more remarkable than the counterpart spectacles which the antagonist forces exhibit, and which recall the descriptions given by the Roman poet of those civil wars where similar standards, similar eagles, and similar bodies of spearmen were arrayed on each side of the field. The very bugle sounds of a British Regiment are recognizm-1 and acted on by an insurgent battalion, the words of command on one side are heard aud understood on the other, and on a particular occasion our enemies actually marched against us with English drums and English trumpets playing " Cheer, boys, CC cheer." Such were the forces against which General RvELocnx and his troops were to advance, under a July sun, and in the very heart of Hindostan. On the 12th of July-after extraordinary exertions had been made to overtake the Fusileers ahead-the whole column came up with the enemy at Futteypore-a town about half-way between Allahabad and Cawnpore, where the rebels presented themselves in a good position with 12 guns. In about three hours the entire force was driven in headlong rout from the field and every gun taken. This success enabled the British Commander to augment the efficiency of his owvn artillery. He had left Allahabad with light 6-pounders only, but he now availed himself of the captured cannon, and, after a halt of a single day, he followed on the track of NzwA SABIB with his own 9-pounders. That morning-the 14ththe column marched 16 miles. On the next day it renewed its advance, and after five miles of its march had been accomplishled fcund the enemy again in sight, strongly posted, and protected by a second position against the rish of a fLmt defeat. At each of these points they were attacked in succession, and from each they were driven with the bayonet, the whole of their artillery being again left on the field. On the day following-the 1Gth,-without any repose, our troops continxuted their advance, and now descried their antagonists collected for a final stand in front of Cawnpore. Their resources had enabled them once more to replace their lost guns by others, and two batteries, well served, presented a X formidable appearance to the advancing column. So strong indeed was their position that it was deen.ed advisable to turn it, and a short but painful movement was executed for the purpose. Hitherto the march of the force had lain along the Great Trunk road leading from Calcutta to Delhi, but this causeway was now quitted by a detachment of the column, which, in the very heat of the day-it was 1.30 p.m.,-toiled through a heavy marsh to get on the enemy's flank. " Many " men," we are told, " dropped from the effects " of the sun," but the task was at length accomplished, and then came the battle and the victory. It was a stubborn fight, for the Sepoys occupied a succession of villages, supplying them with exactly such positions as they hold best, but no resistance was of any avail against the little army pressing on to vengeance. Some of the expressions used by eye-witnesses recall exactly tne descriptions given of the British at the Alma and the French at the Mamelon. " I never," says one writer, s aw anything so fine. The men (of the 78th) "went on with sloped arms like a wall; till within ' 100 yards not a shot was fired. At the word " ' Charge !' they broke just like an eager pack of " hounds, and the village was taken in an instant." This engagement-making the fourth fought in five days-opened the road to Cawnpore, which was promptly occupied, though too late, alas ! for the rescue of its unhappy garrison. In little more than a single week, therefore, these 1,300 British soldiers, with their 800 Sikh comrades, had marched 129 miles along the valley of the Ganges during the heats of July, had fought four fierce actions, had driven 13,000 men from position after position, and had found themselves on the eighth day masters of Cawnpore, the first object of the expedition. Yet even after these exertions the interval of repase allowed was but trifling. On the 19th the troops had reached Bithoor-NExA SAnIB'S stronghold-resolved that British vengeance should reach the villain through all the defences he could devise; but his heart or his army had already failed him, he had evacuated his palace, and nothing could be done beyond consigning the whole place to the flames. Still the work of the relieving force was but half accomplished, and after fighting f'om Allahabad to Cawnpore it remained to fight from Cawnpore to Lucknow. This second part of the expedition has been, not, indeed, less glorious, but less fortunate, than the first. On the 21st General HAvELocx announces in a despatch that he is free to cross the Gaanges, and already on the 29th we find him, with a most seasonable reinforcement received through General NEIrL, twenty miles advanced on his new route, after having fought another successful battle and taken 15 guns. In this positionwith Lucknow only about 30 miles ahead-his army seems to have encountered that dire scourge of Indian armies-more terrible than any human foe-an outbreak of cholera. We know by sad experience with wbat fatality this dreadful disease fastens on an army fatigued bylong marches, worn out by great excitement, and exposed at once to fierce heat and the exhalations of a partly flooded country. It was under similar circumstances, indeed, some 40 years ago, that cholera, with whose fatal course we have now become so sadly familiar, first broke out. But never, even in war, fertile in unlooked-for reverses, was there one which so plainly rebuked all human calculation as this. A general and an army victorious beyond precedent, marching to assured success and the relief of a long-beleaguered fortress, within one march of their object, have been struck by the fatal pestilence, and by our last accounts HAvELOCK and the remains of his gallant band, encumbered by their sick comrades, were painfully retracing their steps to Cawnpore by the route on which they had advanced only a few days before, full of hope and confidence in as holy a cause as ever led men to battle. We cannot attempt to express the sympathy which the calamity that has befallen these brave men will excite, not only in England, but whereever the tale of their gallantry and their misfortune shall be told. After having accomplished more than could be expected of men, they have fallen under the mysterious dispensation of PRovIDysrCx. It is with man, however, that we have to fight, and, as these few hundred heroes have sufficed to overcome every obstacle that the mutineers could oppose, and to defeat them wherever they attempted a stand, we trust that General HAVatOCK may have been able in a few days to resumie his march on Lucknow with recruited ranis, restored health, and better fortune.
The meetings now taking place in all our principal towns for the benefit of the sufferers by the Indian iMutiny testify to the warmth of our national sympathy with the sufferers, and our indignation at the wickedlness and atrocity of the outrages themselves. At such a crisis as the present one these are the natural feelings which must be expected to fill the mind of the nation; they have a right to an absolute pre-eminence. We ought to be absorbed in this suhiect. We do not say that this absorption ought to last for ever and when the events are past and gone; but now, at this moment, it is just, it is natural, that we should be absorbed in this one combined feeling of sympathy and indignation. We are speaking of the nation. The chiefs of the Government and the army cannot afford to be absorbed iu feeling; but the nation has a distinct call now to a high state of feeling,-indignation at abominable crimes and monstrous passions-at rebellion, murder, and brutality. Has an individual a right to the acutest sense of 'vounded selfrespect, and has outraged Britain no right to a concentration of feeling on the subject of fresh and present wrong,-of blood which has just been poured like water upon the earth, and wore outrages than bloodshed,-more especially as such concentration of feeling is prodncing the best practical fruits in the shape of charity to the sufferers? We are sorry to see, in this state of the case, an attempt made in some quarters to divert popular thought from this natural channel into another and a totally irrelevant one. The Bishop of SAsSBuRy is telling his clergy to make use of this particular time for a missionary collection for India. Now, we are not going to give the Bishop of SALISBURY or any one else the opportunity of saying that we object to missions to India. We do not. They are quite right in their place. If any individual resolved before these events to make misionary work in India the work of his life or of any portion of his life, we do not see anything in these events to prevent him from doing so. Bat there is a time for everything under the sun, aud this is not the moment for a man in a public and official position in this countr to be instituting public collections for Indian missions. We know that persons can always mak-e out arn artificial case of opportuneness if they like; we may connect together in some way or other, far-fetched or natural, any two things in nature, and the Indian outrages and Indian missions may be connected together. These outrages, it is said, show that the Hindoos need conversion very much, that their nature is shockingly depraved, and that Christianity oIXq. can improve it, All this may be true enough, and yet if Hindons comrmit horrible crimes, if they rebel, and murder wholesale, there may be another duty which we may have to perform towards them instead of immediate conversion. We cannot look upon them then and there as subjects of conversion; we must look upon them as gubjects of punishment; at least, this aspect must have the precedence. It is plain to every person of common sense that these two subjeets excite two very distinct sets of feelings, which cannot be brought into contact without a jar. How can we aU in a moment rush to convert men with anger, and just anger, in our hearts? In this state of things we are neither particularly fit to convert nor they to be converted. One thing at a time. Talk of misssions at their proper time, but why begin to talk of them now, when we must and ought to be thinking of other things ? There are other duties besides that of converting the heathen. This country is armed by PRovisDtc with power for the punishment of evildoers, and this punishment is at this particular time a high and sacred duty. We enter Hindostan now sword in hand for the necessary, the religious work, of " punishing wickedness and vice," of suppressing a foul rebellion, and bringing the authors of it to justice. Are we with the sword in our hand to convert themr? CHALut&oNR used to eonvert in this way, but we cannot. Modern ethics separate the work of conversion from that of punishment or conquest. What is this awkward, suicidal, inconsistent thing, that the Bishop of SALxsBURY would have us do? To be punishing, shooting, blowing from cannon, destroying, hanging, and converting all at once-all as one act. What a hodge-podge is this I Let lustice, then, have her due; allow her to rule our feelings for the present,-it is only her fair and natural right. Your turn will come some other time, but do not hastily and awkwardly forestall it. We do not wish to make any reflection on the Bishop of SALSBURY; he is doubtless a very conscientious prelate, and probably hethinks it his duty as a Christian Bishop to be making use of every opportunity for urging missions; but he has evidently not caught hold of that great principle of which one of the seven wise men delivered himself-" opportunity." Even looking only to the charitable coUections going on now for the relief of the Indian sufferers, it is unfair to meddle with one charitable collection, which certainly has so conspicuously the prior claim, as being connected with so special, so urgent, and so national a subject-and moreover a subject of the day, demanding immediato attention, whereas that of Christian missions is a general and permanent subject-to interfere, we say, with one charitable collection by introducing simultaneously another. People canuot afford to give to many objects at the same time; if they give to Indian mis3ions the Indian relief will suffer. This is not right, and certainly it is not gracious. The cause of Indian misaions can wait; it has been going on now for many years, and wiU go on many years longer. There will be plenty of opportunities of supporting it. The pressure of the hour has a natural precedence. Nor will the Bishop of SALISBURY do the cause of missions itself any good by associating it with a lukewarm patriotism. We do not mean to say that the Bishop is an indifferent patriot himself; but we must remind him that -when the public is very much absorbed in a great national misfortune, and finds an individual, from however good a motive, diverting, in fact, attention from that misfortune into an irrelevant channel, it wil he apt to make that reflection. This is a pity; it is an injury to the very cause which is thus put forward as a rival one. It is a bad thing for the missionary cause itself that it should stand in the way and be interfering with an urgent national object. Let the present time, then, be devoted to justice and to sympathy. We have a work of just and righteous vengeance to do in India. Let the blood which cries from Delhi, Cawnpore, Jhansi, Bithoor, and other scenes of abominable crime and passion be expiated, let these atrocious criminals be brought to judgment, let every Hindoo know and feel that justice is triumphant, and that rebellion against En,glish rule is not only a crime but a crime which is sure of punishment-let this be done, and we may begin to think of other things, but nothing can be done in or for India till this is done.

AMERICA'. (BY ELECTRIO AND rNTERNATIONAL TzLEGRAPE.) SOUTHAMPTON, THLURSDAY, 11 P.Mi. The United States' mail steam ship North Star, ,Captain Lefebre, has arrived at Cowes on her way to Havre and Bremen. She left New York on the -5th inst., bringing two days' later advices. The 1N orth Star has 32 paesengers for Southamaton, and 67 for Havre and Bremen. She has $100,000 in specie for Havre, and $50,000 for London. There is little political news. Late advices from Yucatan received at New Orleans state that a revolution had broken out and nearly the whole State was in arms. The revolutionists were composed of the Radical party and were everywhere successful. When the Nicanor left the Governor was marching againsi Canipeachy with 1,500 men. Judge Curtis, of the United States' Supreme Court had sent in his resignation, to take effect from October th, 1,st. LieutenaLt James M'Garty, who accompanied Dr. Kane on his last Arctic expedition, died suddenly at Boston on the 2d inst. The Cashier of the Eagle Bank at Rochester, John B. Robertson, had been arrested on a charge of attempting to murder bis wife by administering drugs of a slow but deadly nature. The New York stock-market on the 4th continued inafeverisa, irregularstate. Most of the transactions were for cash, and there appeared to be a good deal of realizing; the time transactions were principaUy buyers' option. At the first board Mi.sourie Sixes ad vanced 1 per cent.; Virginia SLxes, 1; Illinois Central Bonds, 1; Delaware and Hudson, 1; Pennsylvania Coal, 1t; Hudson River Railroad, Ij; MIichigan Central, 1; Mlichigan Southern (Old), 1; ditto, preference, 2i; Panama, 3; Galena and Chicago, 1; Milwaukie and Mississippi, 4. Cumberland declined i per cent. ; Erie, i; farlem, i; Illinois Central ; Cleveland and Pittsburg, A; Chicago and Rock Island, 2. In railroad bondis tbere was quite an active business. The scarcity of New York Central Cash Stock continues. There was a sale at 2 per cent. under the cash price for 30 days, seller's option. It appeared to be very difficnlt to get out contracts on seller's option for over 30 days at any difference in prices. Speculators for a rise were evidently afraid of the months of October and November, and were not disposod to enter into any contracts to mature about that time. At the second board the market took the turn anticipated, prices were all off and stocks were freely ofrered at the closing rates. New York Central declined 1 per cent.; Mlissouri, 6; Milwaukie, 1 ; and Mississippi, 1l; Erie, 1X; Rteading, 4; Michigan Central, 1; Michigan Southern, 17; and Cleveland and Pittsburg, 1i. There was no foundation for the recent sudden improvement in railroad stocks, and only the most shortsighted speculators had been deceived by it. It was expected that prices would go lower than they have touched yet, but the descent would be more gradual than the last. The cotton-market was more active without quotable change in prices. The sales embraced about 1 ,(00 bales, including i00 sold in transitu from New Orleans to Liverpool. Flour was again dull and lower, especially common grades of State and Western, while sales were moderate. New Southern wheat fell off from le. to 2c. per bushel.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES-OFFICE, Friday Momning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre-. spondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m. - A telegraphic despatch of the 15th inst., from Madrid, yesterday announced that the Narvaez Ministry had given in its resignation, which the Queen had sefused to accept. The news arrived at rather an unlucky moment for some of the sup. porters of the Spanish Government in the French press, who, that very morning, had declared their i patrons to be firmer than ever in their places. Of I course these journals are not to be blamed, sirnce, by thus speaking, they do but their duty to,! their employers. The only question is whether these I would not be more efficiently served by eulogiius more muderate than those lavished upon them by their zealous Parisian partisans, who, in their eagerness to counteract the malevolence they impute to certain foreign journals, entirely overshoot the mark. Thus, when they tell us of the honourable friendship existing betwveen Senores Narvaez and Nocedal, of the well-known loyalty of the latter's sentiments, and of the independence and noblenems of his character, of his being ever guided by duty, and never engaged in secret manceuvres and ambitious intrigttes, we are so strongly impressed with the existence of an ironical intention that our eye at once seeks the bead of the sheet to make sure it is La Patrie we have before us. Goodwill prevails over juldgment in such encomiums as these; it is poor service to a friend to extol the very points on which he is most vulnerable. In Madrid, assuredly, these laudations will be read with derision, as by all who are acquainted with the character and career of the present Minister of the Interior in Spain. The telegraph is very concise in its announcement, and we await the details, which are doubtless already on the road. It has been conjectured that the question of Queen Christina's return to Spain may have been the cause of the resignation of the Cabinet. This is not impossible, although hardly consistent with what had previously passed relatively to that question. We know that the Government had consented, although not willingly, to an invitation to the Queen Mother, who is understood to have replied by a private communication to her daughter, to the effect that, while Marshal Narvaez remained at the head of the Cabinet, Madrid would not be graced by her presence. Had the Queen been desirous of a visit from her mother, one might understand her provoking andaccepting the resignation of the Minister obnoxious to the Duchess of Rianzares. But it is pretty certain that Isabella II., who is impatient of restraint, who is a little jealous of her mother's influence and of the sort of court she musters round her when at Madrid, and who also, perhaps, fears a lecture on her absolutist tendencies, and on certain recent scandals, would rather that Maria Christina kept away. Moreover, the telegraph annoL nces that the proffered resignation was refused. If, then, the Dowager Queen was in any way, either passively or actively, the cause of its being offered, this implies some new combination or incident of which we areas yet uninformed. But we need not go so far as Maria Christina for a probable cause of the resignation, under the present sovereign, of the Narvaez Cabinet or of any other Miinistry. Although my latest letters from Madrid speak of the apparently increased chances of stability of the existing Government, such prognostications are always accompanied by a saving clause. Narvaez and his colleagues may have nothing to fear from the press, which is muzzled, from the Cortes, which are dispersed, from the people, who are disarmed, and in one of their periods of disgust, discouragement, and apathy. But they have stil a foe, the more formidable because secret and almost intangible, from whom they are never safe, never delivered, and that foe is what at Madlid is commonly spoken of as " the Palace." In presence of this occult and mischievous power, every political party has in turn declared that Government in Spain is impossible. It is the continuation of the old system of Camarilas. The entozrage, the private friends and confidential coteries of the Quieen, of thlt King, and of the favourite of the day. are continually wvorking for ends of their own, and the attainiment of these ends frequently involves the overthrow of the Government. To these unscrupulous backstairs intriguers no means come amiss. For years past, excepting for a short period during the Espartero-O'Donnell Administration, there has always existed at the Spanish Court an influence which has changed its name, but never its nature. By this influence some Ministries have been upset, whilst others have retained office for a while by basely truckling to it. it has been active of late, and, not a month since, the Nu;,rvaez Cabinet, taken by surprise, was on the point of falling, and of being replaced by a Government of its construction. The Paris organ of the Spanish Mlinistry, desirous to justify its recent predictions, questions the correctness of yesterday's telegraphic despateb, and suggests that it may probablyhave reference to a former crisis. Though this should prove so, it is not the less hazardous confidently to foretel long life to any Government in a country whose Sovereign is so illsurrounded, and so liable to be swayed by unconstitutional influences, which find powerful anxiliaries iiTher capriciousness and loveof mischief. Narvaez is said by his supporters to have a long lease of power. It may be so, and certainly his principal political rivals have hitherto shown little disposition or little ability to dispute its possession; but it must be remembered that not a few of his predecessors in the presidential chair have seemed as firmly installed, and have been upset in an hour by a paltry intrigue and a woman's whim. Persons lately arrived from MadAd inform me that the seizures of the Spanish papers were continual. Some of them had been seized twice in three days. Various foreign papers had also been confiscated. For several days together The Times had been delivered 24 hours late, having been kept back for examination. At the Casino, the principal Madrid club, a notice had been stuck up, caUina the attention of the members to an article of the regulations, forbidding political discussions. The Empress of Russia, who is with her family at DarmBtadt, is suffering from, it is said, suites de couc7es. Her physicians rigidly enjoin the most complete repose. Of course, therefore, her going to Stuttgard is out of the question. Caest commode. It is quite certain that the Empress: of the Frei ch wiU not accompany har husband on his trip te (ku.. many. The nat"-re of the preparations now making for his journey r that he goes alone. He is to leave Chalons on the morning of the 24th, from Strasburg direct. The talked-of interview with the King of Prussia is entirely discredited. The fabricators of reports have nowgotupone of a meeting between the Emperors of France and Austria. This is at least premature, but I believe there is no doubt that Baron Bourqueney at Vienna, and M. Hubner at Paris, have been for some time working to bring about a raPProchement between the two Courts. Whilst the papers are full of glowing accounts of the opening of the railway from. Chalons to the camp, and of the Imnperial train, with its sump- tuous apartmerts, costly bro3zes, Aubusson, carpets, Beauvais tapestry,, bed hangings o. violet damask, and boudoir,, d6osrated with tender green, the gentlemen pay, the s;re. holders of the Chemin de Fer de lltst,8grumble audibly. On the 7th of July the construction of the branch was decided upon, on the 12th the worlks began, and on the 1lth of September the line was opened. Rapid, but costly. In order to lose no time, sacrifices must be made; there was no leisure for the usual forms of expropriation, and the land was bought by private contract of the country people. Now, even Champenois peasants, proverbially stupid, can drive good bargains under such circumstances. In various ways unusual expesse had to be incurred to accelerate the works. The Imperial train, stated to have coat 300,000 f., cost in reality half a million. All this outlay for a branch that will certainly yield notbing, and probably leave a loss on the workiug expenses, is not satisfactory to the shareholders, who seem to consider that they have been sold by the manage. ment of the company for an Imperial smile and a few bits of red ribbon. The affair reveals one of the unhealthy spots of the Imperial Court. The Emperor is surrounded by adulators, who fly to fnlfil his slightest wish, and not one of whom has the courage or disinterestedness to tell him the truth. He has plenty of supple courtiers, but faithful counsellors are few. Thus, he takes a fancy to have a railway to the camp, and to have it done in time to use this year. Instead of representing the objections, whose weight his good sense would certainly have admitted, those who should have done so conceal them, and zet frantically to worktohumour him. This is only one instance of the systemof adula. tion that prevails; others might be cited. There is danger in it; it is the insidious poison that has led some of the greatest sovereigns astray; and it is to be hoped that the Emperor wiU perceive in time the nature of the pleasant, but perilous draught. It is said this afternoon that the Emperor will come to Paris before going to Sttutgard, where the Emperor of Russia is expected to arrive on the 24th, the same day as the Emperor Napoleon. M. Rayneval and M. Kisseleff, the French ambassador at St. Petersburg, and the Russian ambassador at Paris, will be at Stuttgard duting the interview. In the Emperor's absence King Jerome wil preside in the Council of Ministers. It is strongly reported here that the diminution of standing armies will bo a principal subject brought on the tapis between the Emperors in their approaching interview. A Russian orgin says it will be impossible for the Emperor o*f Russia to come to Paris this year, as he must be at Kiew at the beginning of October. The Duke of Cambridge arrived in Paris yeste:day, and leaves to-day for the Camp of Chalons. Prince Buonaparte, the officer of Spahis, has also proceeded thither. Reports are in circulation that engineers will set to work entrenching the camp as soon as the troops leave. As yet not much credit has been attached in Paris to this ruraour. I hear that a new bishop is to be appointed, with the title of Bishop of Tunis, and that the Pope has selected a French ecclesiastic for this bishopric i1 pas tibus. A museum of artillery is to be established at Algiers, to receive a collection of all the arma in use in that country from the earliest periods. It is reported that Redschid Pasha has asked leave of the Sultan to come to Paris. A telegraphic despatch says that Prince Dauiel of Montenegro has been assassinated by the relative of a man he had caused to be put to death. The corvette Durance and the gunboat Fus6e had got separated (according to the last accounts received from the Chinese Seas) from the French squadron under the command of Admiral Rigault deGenouilly, and some anxiety was felt concerning them. We have now accounts of the first five days of the Moldavian elections. As was anticipated, the last three days were far from being so favourable to the prospects of the Unionists as the first two. The UniVc3rs has gone mad, ecce signum:- "'France did not perish after having lest Canada. and she bas gained Algeria. Spain forfeited a world id zemained a DL Lon. Europe wil bless Spain for having planted Catholic sot iety in Mexico, and will soon see her engaged in other works; for Morocco will be Spanish, as Algeria, Tanis, and Tripoli will be French. Who can say that the day will not dawn, and every Fronohman ought to desire it, when France, the elder sister of Catholic nations, queen of the Mediterranean, and seated on the Alps and the ocean, shall resume her old motto, and, for the love of Christ the liberator of men, form plans as capacious as the globes2 This is not obiraericil I God and France may desire this result, and in that case the opposition of the SiWlte or Deats would be of very little consequence. Every Catholic nation would participate in this great work of genuine conquest, and England would cut a very pitiful figure even with regard to Portugal. God permits nations to repent, but if England does not repent her heresy, we see no better fate in store for her than general contempt. Therefore, when the work of God shall be accomplished, triamphant Enl land wiu be punished for having proved wanting to the work of the Most High in the long course of her prosperity." Fundch had better look to his laurels; he will be losing his subscribers. The Univers is rapidly becoming the funniest paper in Europe. A letter from Lyons, of the 14th inst., informs us that the manufacturers of that city have suffered severe losses in consequence of a disawtrous inundation in the department of the Arde he. One mill belonging to a manufacturer in Lyons, and estimated at 500,000f., is said to have been carried away by the flood. Unfortunately this is not an isolated fact, and other losses not less serious arc mentioned. A letter from Verdun likewise mentious that the farmers in the Meuse had suffered severely by the heavy rains, which had damaged their crops.

As I have already informed vou, r +or of RuEsia arrived here laee . -Aday at 2 o ciock p.m. The King went toreceove iiim at the terminus of the Nieder-Scblesisch Railvway, by which the Emperor had travelled on his way from Warsaw hither, and they came on together by the junction railway, which runs round the town connecting all the lines, to the terminus of the Potsdam Raiway. Here the Prince of Prussia and aU the other Royal Princes, the Ministers, Generals, and high functionaries of State, the municipal authorities, together with the Russian Minister, Baron Brunnow, the personnel of the Embassy, and all the Russian officers at present in Berlin, were assembled en grande tenue to receive him. In addition to the abovre there were present the folowing Princes now on a visit to this Ceurt for the purpose of att2nding the manceu.ees:: the Elector of HIesse, the Grana Duke, of' Meeldenburg Schwenn, Prince Frederick, of the Netherlands, Prxiac George of Modlenburg Strolitz, the Duke of Nassau, &c. The Empereor was accormpanied by lPrince Gortsrckloff and General AdJerberg,. After very cordiP6<ks44g,g all his relationmaith. kiss on eah cheek, and greeting many others by a warm shake of .the hand or a few worda of recognition;| the Emperor proceeded to inspect a company of the regiment that is called after his and his uncle'a name, Kaiser Alexander, and which had been selected to form his guard of honour at the aLilway station. The Emperor wore the uniform of a Prussian General, with the Order Of the Black Eagle; the King and the Princes of Prussia, on the other hand, wore the unitorm of their respective Russian regiments and the Russian Order of St, Andrew. After a short stay in the waiting rooms of the railway station, for the purpose of certain persons being presented to the Emperor, the entire party drove off to Charlottenburg, where the Queen was in waiting with her various visitors and ladies of her Court ready to receive them. The Emperor has remained at Charlottenburg during the whole of his stay; this afternoon, at 4 o'clock, he will leave here for Weimar, and go on from there to Darmstadt, and Stuttgard, at which latter place he will have a meeting with the Emperor Louis Napoleon on the 25th inst. On the 2d of October the Emperor will return hither with the Empress, and after a stay of a couple of days at this Court, will proceed from here to IWarsaw, Kiew, and Moscow, returning to St. Petersburg by the 23d of that month. Yesterday the Emperor and all the abovementioned princely guests accompanied the King to the camp at- Spandau, where the 3d army-corps and the Guards were encamped round and about the environs of the fortress in preparatlon for the grand manceuvres and sham fights, which commenced immediately after the arrival of the august party. Afrer returning, to Charlottenburg to dinner, theI whole party went over again to Spandan from Charlottenburg in the evening, for the purpose of viewing the spectacle of these numerous troops bivouacking in the open air, and dissipating the darkness of theplain of Brandenburg by theircheerful watch fires. Prince Frederick Wiliam, who is still withhis regiment in Silesia, repaired to Breslau to receive the Emperor of Russia as he passed through that town at 5 o'clock on the morning of Monday, on his way from Warsaw. The day after to-morrow the young Prince will join his father at Babelsberg, and stay with him till the end of the montb, and it is arranged at present that he will spend Christmas with our Royal family. The King hba signified his intention of being present at the closing sitting of the Evangelical Conferences, which will be held to-morrow forenoon, and in the course of next week will go on a visit to Prince and Princess Frederick of the Netherlands, at their beautiful estate of Muskau. The Evangelical Conferences continue to take place every day without interruption. As your space can hardly be devoted to a critical resume of the discourses delivered there, I will confine myself to stating what subjects were treated, and, for the benefit of those who take a special interest in these questions, will mention that an ample report of the proceedings, will be published in English in a religious periodical, called Evangdieal Christendom, the organ of the Evangelical Alliance. The forenoon of Monday was (devoted to the consideration of the follow ing question:-" To what is the observer impelled on perceiving, that in spite of the return of theology to the standard of church profession, so little spiritual life evidences itself in the population ?" In the afternoon there were reports read as to " the state of ecclesiastical and religious matters in Switzerland," and also in the United States of North America. In the morning sitting of yesterday the questien was treated as to " What course Evangelical Christians have to take with respect to the aggressive tactics of the Roman Catholic Church i" And in the evening several reports were read of the progress and workings of missionary labour among the Jews, and also among the heathen. In the morning sitting two of our countrymen, the Rev. James Lord and the Dean of Canterbury, fig,ured as speakers, and their English speeches were necessarily interpreted for the benefit of the assembly. The Dean of Canterbury bewailed his unacquaintance with the German language, and offered the best he had in its stead, good Saxon English. He expressed his warm recognition of the kind welcome extended here to himself and hs countrymen, and regretted their inability duly to express this to their German friends. Be pointed out that England, which had already obtained a political consentaneity with Germany, was now desirous of attaining a union with her in matters of religion. None had contributed more to these two results than Chevalier Bunsen, who had lived so long among us, and whom it had been a great source of pleasure to us aU to see again in Berlin, the honoured guest of the King. Reverting to the approaching union of the two Royal families, the Dean stated the desire felt in EDgland for a union also of English and German theology. People in England had for a long time been borrified at the idea {of German theology being introduced there, but now they were as desirous of learning divinity from German theologians as of receiving instruction in science at the hands of German investigators. In the evening a Scotch clergyman, of the name of Edward, delivered a most eloquent and energetic address in German on the subject of missions to the Jews, and Dr. Caird, a Scotchman also, who presided on this occasion, interpreted the various communications that were made on this subject by English missionaries. The very satisfactory impression produced on the assembly this evening by the talented addresses of our two North British countrymen in a language those present could understand, leads me to point out here what a fruitful source of evil in such great acts as these Evangelical Conferences in Germany are, the ignorance of the language of the country is to the visitor. The unacquaintance with what is going on all around and before him, and of what is being pronounced from the cathedra, and all the ennui and lassitude thus entailed upOn. a man on a crowded platform in a very hot church, are but small evils, because they a.re only personal, and traceable directly to the individual's own want of knowledge; .-fortunately, however, it gives rise to a very mnsatisfattory feeling with many, that after having travelled so far, sacrificed so much time and money for the cause to which they are ready and willing still further to devote so much energy and talent, they are totally in the dark as to what is going on. What little comes to them by the aid of some casual interpreter standing near them, suffers a very confusing amount of aberration from the true meaDing in the imperfect attempt made by the impromptu linguist, and this ray of tnrbid light impinging on a mental retina already occupied by preconceived notions on the subject, produces anL intellectual picture that is far from a reflex of the truth intended to be conveyed. Again, the inevitable loss of time entailed by the necessity of translating all that pamses to the foreigner, and inlterpreting again all that he may be dispossa to remark in connexion with Ft to the wvaiting Germans, forms a very natural reason with. men who have much business to get through in a short time, for not inviting a foreigner.-tn assist in retarding its execution, and this, T tbia%.muat be received by ourcountrymen present at. these conferences, as one reason, among other*,.wby they bave not been invited to. take as actEo.andextensive a shsre in the condu# ot b nin',. a theS y feel that their , station, zeal, knowledge of busines, and the sacrL fices they have made to come here, entitled them to. If Great Britain is really convinced and conscious of her grext misson in politics and religion she will perceive at once the necessity of her sons maldng thamselves familiar with the languages of those countries she desires to influence, since it is too illogical to Lxpect that other countries shall faniliarise themselves with our language before that influence is exerted. The readiest means of acquiring the influence desired is to put our ideas before foreigners in a language they understand; when we have acquired that inflnence they will learn ours. The Secretary of the Berlin Branch of the Evangelical Alliance has repeatedly,in the course of these conferences, not only nterpreted discourses from German into Englisb, and vice versd, but has communicated important notifications impromptu in German, French, and English. Dr. MIerle; D'Aubign6, the Genevese historian of the'Reformation has also discoursed in all three languages. That is what is wanted for our international conference. Lord Bloomfield has entered his name on the list of the members of the conference, has subscribed 25 thalers towards its expenses, and has been present at some of the meetings. AUSTRIA. (inOIr OUlR OWN GORRESPOnIM)zr.) VI4NNA, SEPT. 15. The only intelligence to be forwarded to-day is that some new financial measure is about to be taken by Government. The Bourse is of opinion that Reich.s-schatz-seine (Exchequer Bills) to the amount of 150,000,000 fl. are to be issued, but the Minister of Finances is not likely to have recourse to a measure which could not but have a most injurious effect on the paper currency. Should the State begin to fabricate notes again, the probability is, that the premium on the precious metals would coon be as high as it was two or three years ago. ITALY. The Corrire Aercan,tile gives some details of the damage done by the late fire in the dockyard of Se&ti Ponente, near Genoa. Two small vessels were completely burnt, and had the wind blown in the direction of the fort, upwards of 20 vessels would hdve shared the same fate. The loss is stated to be 200,000f. A rumour is current that the fire was by no means accidental. SPAIN. rAn account was given some time ago of the son of a wealthy geftleman of, Malaga, of the name of Campos, having been carried off by one of the bands of brigands which infest the province of that name, and of a sum of 12,000 piastres (63,000f.) having been extorted for his ransom. On the day the ransom was paid, the son, who is amere boy, returned home, but he could not give respecting the robbers' retreat any information calculated to causetheir arrest. Afew days backM.Campos received two strangeanonymaous letters; one, appearing to come from the chief of the brigands, declared that if, within 'a given time, he should not publish a statement in the newspapers to the effect that his son had been restored to him without ransom, he should be put to death; the other, appeariDg to come from a simple member of the ,band, declaring that if he did not at once pay the 12,000 piastres he had promised, he and all his family should be carried off and murdered. These letters cause it to be supposed that the chief of the brigands appropriated the sum paid him for the boy's ransom. The authorities'are making the most active efforts to discover the retreat of the robbers.
I LIFE IN DELHI. (From the Liahore Chronice.) The following statement of a native regardino the interior stte of Delhi in May and June is mioat interesting - *'IrachedDelhi on the 21zt of May, 1857, andstayed there tilthe 23d of June. "On my muval there I saw five infantry regiments and the BowArg of the 3d Cavalry, who were stationed in lulohtab bsgh and Salirmgtrh. " The Sepoys were so much afraid of the EngIsh foroec that they looked quite pale. The cavalry muttineers had a little spirit, and were wishing to go to Meerat for a fight; but the footmen did not agree with them, sayiog we are hardly sufficient to guard Delhi. how can we go to Meerut ? I wite give You a small description of the oppreasion committed by Sepoys in Delhi. I They plundered every rich house and shop in tbe city. They took every horse they found in the stables of the mitizens. They klled a number of poor shopkeepers for sking the proper prlices for their things; they abuse the respectable men of Delhi in their presence. The guard at Jumrnabrdge looted' the passengers crossing it. On the 11th of May the magazine was blown up; it did great damsge to the adjacent houe and killed about 5oO passengers walking in different streets. The buUets fell in the houses of people to such a degree that some children pickd'up two pounds and some four pounds of them from the yards of their houses; afterwards the mutineers, together with the low people of the city, entered the magaeine compound and brgan to plunder weapons, acCeotrements, gun. cape, &c. " Tho ' loot' oontinued for three days. Each Sepoy took three ar four muskekt and as many swords and baYonets as he could. The calassies flled their houses with fine blacksmith's tools, weapons, und gun caps, which tbey sell by degrees at the rate of two seers per rupee. The copper sbeets were sold at three seers per rupee. in these successful days the highest prioe of a musket was eight annas; however the people feared to buiy it; a fine English sword was dear for four aunas, and one anna was too much for a good bayonet. ,Pouches and belts were o common that the owners could not get anything for this bootv of theirs The gunpowder which was kept at Mnjnnos Tila, more than half of it was plundered by Goojurs and countrymen, and the rest was brought to the city. Since the day of mny arrival till the day of my departure I never found the bazaar opened, except a few poor shops. The shopkeepers and the citizens are extremely sorry for losing their safety, and curee the mutineers from morning to evening. Poor people and workmen st'rve and widows cry in their huts. Respect. bble English servants have confined thembelves to their houses. "1A Kotwal is changed every second day. The Sepoys plundered every treasury in the city and put the money in their own pockets; they did not give a farthiDg out of this to the King, so the Sepoys of four or five regimehts poSsetsed thousands of rupees each, and under the weight of silverthey could hardly walk, conFequently they wereobliged to change their silver for gold. The Mahajuns charge them 24 or 25 rupees for a gold mohur, which is not worth more than 16 rupees. Since the banker.; were plundered by the Sepoys they also cheated them by giving them brass coins instead of gold ones. "The poor regiments are very jealous of tboes wbo are rich.; as the rich Sepoys don't wish to go to fight, or to the field of battle simply, they are very often iusulted by their poor friends. l am of opinion their private feelings will compel them to fight with each other some day or otber, as many times during my stay at Delhi I heard tbere was very likely to be a quarrel between the rich and poor regiments. "One regiment from Allygbur and Mynpoorie, 150 Sowae. and some unarmed Sepoys from Agra, one regiment and 200 Sowars from Hansi and Hiasar, some unarmed SeF poys from Umballa, 200 Sowars and two companies of Nizamut from Muttra, 6th Light Cavalry, two regiments from Jullundur, and two regiments and artillery from NuEserabad reached Delhi before me and joined the matineers. "eI will acquaint you with the names of the stations from whence the rebels brought tre%sure for tho King - Moradnuggur Tebseel - tollgate, near Hindeas-bridge, Rohtuck, Ayghur, Hand, Muttra, Hursaroogurhie, Tirsaiti, out of which his Majesty pays four annas to each footman and one rupee to each trooper per diem. I am quite ignorant of the aimount of the money, but I k aiow as far as this, that on the 17th of June there V,was left one lakh aud 19,000 rupees in the King's treasury. ,"The princes are made officers to the Royal army-thousands of pities for the poor luxurious princes. he7 are sometimes compelled to Fo out of the door of the city in the heat of the sun; their hearts palpitate from the firing of muskets and guns. "Unfortunately, they do not know how to command an army; their forces laugh at their imperfections, and abuse them for their bad arrangements. The Riug sends sweetmeats for the forces in the field, and the guard at the d aor of the city plunder it like the property of an enemy. The bravery of the Royal troops deserves every praise; they are veTy clever indeed; when they wish to leave the field of battle they tie a pieee of rag on their leg, and pretend to bave been wounded, and come into the city lame and groaning, accompanied by theirfriends. On the night of the 30th of June, at the Hindun. bridge, the mutineers were quite out of their senses; a good maDy of them threw their muskets and swords in the wolls, and scattering on the road ran towards villages and jungles, as they thought themselves to have been purdued by English soldiers. " Had the English forces taken them they could have taken Delhi the same night, because the Sepoys did not eturu to the city tilt next morning, and many of them diseppeared for ever; they were plundered and beaten by Goomurs and did not bring a farthing back with them " The old KZing is very seldom obeyed; but the princes are never. " The soldiers never mind their regimental bcgle, disolhey their officers, and neglect their duty; they are never mustered, and never dressed in uniform. The noblemen and begums, together with the prinoes, regret for the loss of their joyful days. They consider the arrival of smutineers at Delhi a sudden misfortune for them. " The princes cannot understand the Sepoys without anl interpreter. The shells have destroyed lots of houses in the city; and in the fort the marble of the King's private hall is broken to pieces. His Majesty is very much alarmed vhaen a shell is burst in the castle, aud the princes show Ilus Majesty the pieces of it. Many of the Royal family have left the palace through fear. The Delhi CoUege wss destroyed to-day. English books are l ing in the streets still, and Sepoys beat aud imprison people for speaking English."
OFFICERS SAVED. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Observing in your second edition of this date the names of the foUowing officers among the kiUed,-"L eutenant Montgomery Hunter, Ensign W. D. Barwell, asd Surgeon R. H.

THE BENGAL MILTrARY FuNDS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Yonr columns appear open to all suggestions made for the relief of "sufferers iu Indis ;" I tberefore make no apology for troubling you with these few lines. The Bengal military funds were, as perhaps you may be aware, in no very prosperous codition before thia hideous mutiny broko out, and it was found necessary, probably by reason of the large accession of annuitants in the shape of widows and orphans caused by the wars of the Sutlej in 1845-46 and the Punjab of 1848-49, not only to increase the monthly subsariptions of officers, but to reduce the annuities of the widows. I see by a statement made by Colonel Henderson, the agent to the funds in England, at the Mansion-house some time ago, that 30 additional widows bad then been brought on the books of tbo military fund, and ere this it is pos3ible that this number may have been doubled; and when the matiuyissuppressed, and the sad list nnade up, no doubt a larger number, with their children, will have to be provided for from the funds of these noble institutions. It is clear, therefore, taking the pzesent sthte ot the Bengal Military and Orphan Funds into consideration, that unless the public come to their aid the great inoreae of annuitants will have one tf two oonaequenoes-either that the, iresent subscriptions, which are not light, will have to be considerably increased, and the burden of supporting the sufferers will fall on the surviving offioers; or the annuities, not now too high for comfort, and to afford education to children, will have to bo considerably reduoed; and thus the burden will fall upon those less able to bear it than the cfficers-viz., the widows of these who havo died previously in India-widows whose husbands daring their service aid their regular subscriptions, and died in tho hope that ytheeo payments they had secured to their widows and chDildren a oomfortable provision; which would be the case under ordinary circumstances. I have seen it stated that the fund now being so gene. rously subsoribed to in England is only intended for those who have no claim upon the GoverDment or upon any fands; but this mutiny being a natio,al calamity, beyond ordinary calculations, the military funds of 13en,l have a claim so a chase of national sympathy and assistance; and I feel sure that the most efcacious way of smsisting the widows and childrenaof our Indian officers whohalve fallen victimx to the cruelties of the Sepoys, and of comforting the hearts of those who surive, and whose self-devotion to their country in so many istanoes ham been the theme of sev.ral articles in your pper, is to iusure to them the solvency of tbeir military fands, By this means the nation will relieve tho beaviest anxiety of all officers in the Hon. Company's militar Bertvice in Beagal, and you wjfl hew of no gillan: soldier dying with the expreseAon on his lips of ' What will become of my wife and children ?" I therefore say, if atny esitsance he given to widows sad children of officers on the Bengal military funds irreepec tive of relievieg immodiate and pressing want%, let it be in the shape of payments to those institutions, that being the best meaus of relievinz them from nermsanent distra.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCB. I AUSTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN COItRESPOlNDENT. ) AA portion of the following appeared In our second dtion of yeeterday :-I VIENNA, SEPT. 13. Those politicians who believe it to be absolutely necessary to the future welfare and prosperity of Austria that the principle of the unity of the empire should be rigidly maintained are well pleased with the autograph letter which Eis Majesty the Emperor addressed to the Governor-General of Hungary on tne 9th inst. They are of opinion that the Hungarian nobles have too long been permitted to oppose the measures of Government, and appear convinced that the political excitement which has so long prevailed in Hungary "will subside now that the Emperor hasg expressed his determination to uphold the present system." The Vtienna papers have not yet made any remlarks on tkhe Imperial rescript, and they have probably received a hint that it would be better not to do so. A Vienna correspondent informs the -Augs&urg aczette that the necessary measures have been takea to prevent any -agitation by mneanis of the provlncial (Hungarian) press, and it will therefore be somewhat difficult to learn what impression His Majesty's letter has produced in Hungary. As to the Hungarians in this city, they are in a furious rage, and declare that they were basely misled by the provincial authorities, who assured them when the Emperor and Empress were about to visit Hungary that concessions in respect to language and schools would be made. It is possible that some over-zealous epmoyfs sought to stimulate the enthusiasm of the Magyars by means of promises which were never to be realized, but it is a positive fact that the superior authorities never held out any hope that there would be a change of system in Hlungary. As to the public schools, articles 5, 6, ', 8, and 31 of the Concordat place them so entirely in the hands of the Roman Catholic hierarohy that the Imperial authorities have no right to meddle in the matter. The following facts wil give you a tolerably correct idea of the actual state of public feeling in Hungary. At the beginning of thii montha good company of German actors (20persons) wisbed to give dramatic representations at Veszprim, a county tOwn, with a population of 12,000 persons, but no performance took place because not above two dozen persons presented themselves at the doors of the theatre. lt was the same case at Fiinfkirchen, a "Royal free city" in the Baranyer county, where a German company, consisting of 40 persons, could not bring together an audience of the same strengtb. At Pesth the Hungarian theatre is always crowded to excess, but the German actors play to empty benches. Persons who have returned to Vienna after an absence of two or three months are surprised to find such general discontent and dejection here, but it appears to me to be natural enough that people should be "out of heart." Austria has completely lost the position which she had acquired in Germany, she is almost isolated in Europe, she is more priest ridden than any other country in the world, trade is unusually dull, and there is a monetary crisis. The Gallician Railroad Company is about to demand a first payrnent of 30 per cent. on its shares, but it will have great ditficulty in getting the money, as many of the subscribers will refuse to pay, the concession made to the company by Government having mndergone a change since the subscriptions were made. The railroad from Cracow to Przeraysl has been added to the line originally conceded, and those subscribers who wish to back out of the affair affect to consider themselves released from their engagements. The Credit Bank, the shares of which were yesterday afternoon but 1J per cent. above par, has engaged to advance 20 per cent. on the Galician Railroad shares; but it is not clear to me that it will be able to do so, for by far the greater part of its capital of 60,000,000 florins is engaged in the Western and Theiss railroads. The fact is, that the infant Credit Bank has been laden beyond its strength by Baron Bruck. The Concordat has not only led to misunderstandings betweea the State and the Church, but between the bishops and their subordinates. It was stipulated that the monastic establishments should undergo a reform, and the monks be obliged to live in strict accordance with the rules and regulations made by the founders of their respective orders. Accordingly, the Archbishop of Vienna informed the Dominicans residing in this city that they must have their heads shaven in a certain way, sinlg psalms in their church at midnight, repeat their prayers at 3 o'clock in the mormng, and castigate themselves. The Domiinicans, with the excepion of three, refused to agree to this, and alleged tat when they took the vows they only pledged themselves to observe the regulations which were at that time in force in their monastery. The Archbishop has sent the refractory monks to a Dominican convent at Maissau, in Lower Austria, and has summoned other Dominicans from Belgium and Italy. In the meantime some priests belonging to the Cathedral of St. Stephen, who for the time being have consented to live d la St. Dominic, will do duty until the expected Dominican friars arrive. The Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna is gone on a pilgrimage to Mariazell, but, as the times when people walked to the shrines of the Virgin and of the saints with unboiled peas in their shoes are long gone by, you will not be surprised to learn that his Eminence went to Milizzuschlag by rail, and from that place to M-ariazell in his own equipage. The 15,000 Hungarian pilgrims, who were accompanied by 27 0 priests, have returned from Mariazell. Two seminaries for the education of Roman Catholic pedagogues are to be established in Slavonia and Croatia. According to private advices from Peath very great excitement prevailed in the Protestant Assembly which was held in that city a few days ago. Alention was made of the total want of independence of the Protestant church in Hungary, and the Imiperial Commissary had to listen to bitter complaints that no answer had been givern to the petition for permission to hold a General Synod. The Assenibly at last resolved again to petition that the Protestant Church might be placed in its former situation, and a Synod convoked. The commission of the " Riveraiu" States has not completed its labours as is reported, but it has interrupted its sittings until soine of its members have received further instructions from their Goveriments. SMMrvznBER 14. It is very generally reported in the city that the Emperor of Austria intends to meet the Emperors Napoleon and Alexander at Stuttgard, but information has this morning been given me that their Majesties will leave Vienna for Ischl iu the Salz Kammergut towards the end of the month. The speedy and unexpected returnof Baron Budberg from Warsaw forms one of the principal topics of conversation in political circles, and it is believed that he is the bearer of some friendly message from his Sovereign to the Emperor Francis Joseph. The Vienna diplomatists, who seemed much perplexed when they first learned that the Emperors Alexander and Napoleon were about to meet, have entirely recovered their self-possession, and profess to believe that the interview between the two bIonarchs " will be attended with the very best consequences." This probably means that the Emperor of the French will endeavour to bring about a better understanding between Russia and England and Austria. On the 9th there was a popular festival, or "Bacchanale" in the public gardens of Milan. The gardens were lighted up at the expense of the city, and appropriate amusements were provided for the people. The festival commenced at 4 in the afternoon, but the Milanese were much less noisy and turbulent than usual, although there was no, oeartn or ropedancers, tumblers, fantoccini, imprT visato,i, magnetizers, and musicians Between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening the Archduke and Archduchess drove in an open carriage from the Palace to the publio gardens, where they were received by Count Sebregondi, the Podesta, and some other civic dignitaries. The burgher band struck up the " Braban9onne" as the Archduchess Charlotte entered the garden, round which their Imperial ighnesses, who were preceded by a detachment of Pompiers, walked. A fter a stay of about an hour the Court party returned to the balcony of the palace to see the cathedral, which was lighted up with Bengal lights. The white -ight, which lasted about 20 minutes, was like a veil to the cathedral, and the details of its beautiful architecture were only seen when the colour of the light became deep red. The King of the Belgians is at the Villa Giulia on the Lake of Como. Great complaints are made of the inactivity of the Board of the Lombardo-Venetian Railroad Company. Nothing has been done during the last year excepting the Bergamo-Coccaglio line, but the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian King- dom has obtauied a promise that the Casarsa-UdineNabresina Railroad, which will unite Trieste and Venine, shall be begun without delay. The Austrian Government is naturally impatient that the railroad in question should be completed, because it will enable it, if necessary, to send its troops into the heart of Italy with equal speed and convenience. It is said that the negotiations between the AUs- trian Government and Mr. Brett for the construc- I tion of a submarine telegraph from Ragusa to Corfu, and thence to Alexandria, are almost coneluded. As a matter of course, the station in Corfu will be under the sfiperintendence of the British authorities. The British Government and the East India Company will be at liberty to forward their despatches from Corfu through Austria, or through Sardinia by way of Malta. ITALY. (FROM OUR OWN CORIISPONDEN.) NAPLES, SEPT. 9. The grand annual fete of Pie di Grotta was celebrated on Tuesday last with the usual military display and ceremonles. The day was remarkably fine, and there was an unusually large concourse of persons from the country,-some to gratify their curiosity, others for devotion. Among those many came in as if on a pilgrimage, bearing crosses and a scallop shell. The King and Queen, and all the Royal family, together with the Court, were present in 14 carriages; but a colder spectacle surely never was witnessed. Not a voice was uttered, not an eye gleamed brighter at the approach of the "adored Sovereign." Contrasts, too, were drawn between the progress of Victor Emmanuel recently, when he went to visit the works at Mont Cenis, and that of Ferdinand If. through his capital. The former was marked by enthusiasm and goodwill; the latter by coldness or hatred on the part of the people, and suspicion on that of the Sovereign. Hundreds of personos among the Capopopolani, artists and persons of a higher class marked by the police, were arrested on the Monday and Tuesday, and confined in the Vicaria, the Prefettura, and the different Commissariats. Sorne were let out again on the Tuesday night, but in this tranquil, prosperous, and happy country, as it is called in Episcopal addresses, the King dares not to go through the capital without first filling the prisons. There was an immense body of the police on the ground, and the heights above Posilippo were crowded with Guardia Urbana all intent on uarding against secret enemies. On the u1onday the agents of the goldsmiths called Sensall, who get their bread by completing bargains between purchasers and sellers were called before the Commissary of the Pendina and informed that they could not be permitted to remain in that quarter during the fete, and, in fact, they were all shut up. Such is the condition of happy Naples. Five per Cents., 112i ; exchange on London, 550. ROME, SErP. 8. The official journal of Rome gives accounts that might set one to sleep standing of the return of the Pope to his city. I myself followed the cortAge step by step, and I can assure you that, except the "svivas" emitted by the agents of police and a handful of salaried persons, the population maintained an attitude worthy of it. Curiosity alone had brought the people to see the cort-Age pass; as to enthusiasm, it was below zero. The allegorical paintings orn&menting the triumphal arch at the Ponte Molle and the Piazza del Popolo were "the Austrian Concordat," "the Immaculate Conception," and "the Establishment of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy inL England." Suob were in general the subjects of the different paintings. On the triumphal arch in the Piazza del Popolo was an inscription in Latin, of which the translation is, " The Pontiff Pius returns to the Eternal City." On the sides of a triumphal arch erected by the mercbants there were two alegories, cne relating to the Austrian Concordat, and the other to the definition of the Immaculate Conception ! Comment on the subject seems to me quite unnecessary. The " claque " organized for the purpose of misleading the people during the entry of the Pope deserted en masse after having received the bread, meat, wine, and money distributed among them. The whole of the garrison was umder arms-a part in the squares and streets, and part in their own quarters. Pour guns of the French Artillery, with their ammunition waggons, occupied the Piazza Colonna. The illumination of the Corso with gas by an English company attracted a large crowd from its novelty. This mnorning the Pope presided at an Ecclesiastical Council in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo. Thence his Holiness, escorted by a brilliant eortge, proceeded to the Spanish Embassy, for the purpose of blessing the monument of the Immaculate Conception, which was completely uncovered to-day for the first time. The esterior of the Embassy was transformed into a sort of antique temple. The Pope was received by the corps diplomatiVpe and the members of the Sacred College, having at their head Cavaliere Mon. The Holy Father, having bean robed in the Pontifical vestments, performed the religious office in the midst of the most perfect indifference.
THE MANCHESTER EXHIBITION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The managers of the Manchester Exhibition are beginning to discover that it will not pay, that the middle and lower classes do not take that interest in it which they were expected to take. I myself am an educated person, fond of art, and conversant with many of the great galleries both at home and abroad, yet there are several classes of pictures of whioh I know very little, of which I should like to know more. Abundant specimiens of these are to be seen at Manchester, and, if I could walk np to a picture and see at once by a label on the frame ite subject and its painter's name, I should be enabled to inspect 100 pictures in less time and with less fatigue to my eyesight than is now requisite to hunt out a dozen in the catalogue; and if such labels would be a boon to me, being such a person as I have described myself to be, how much greater boon would they be to persons less acquainted with art and virtU than I am ! A suggestion to this effect was made by me when the Exhibition first opened, was admitted to be a good one but was not adopted, because the managers expected to make money by the sale of catalogues, and feared such a step might check it. Benny wise auid pound foolish. H.
"TIIE LONd:EST WVAY ROMD' TO INDIA.-It is true that Calcutta Is 14,000 miles by the Cape and only 8,000 by Alexandria and Suez, and that passengers by the latter route require only half the time of those by the other. But there is a difference in such natters between a few scores of passengers and a large army. It is comparatively easy to transport a steamer's passengers across the isthmus in two or tbree omnibuses; but it is a very different thing to convey a wbole army, with its ammunition and other accompaniments, in a country where all manner of means and appliances, though perfect as to the usual number of passengers carried by the Oriental Company's steamers, o not admit of immediate or adequate extension. The means, in short, by which our Indian passengers are carried by the short route form a mere turead of civilization running tbrough a wilderness, and are inapplicable to any other, and especially any larger purposes. Supposing the troops carned LU and about the same time as the passengers to Alexandria and then from Suez to Caleutta, it is probable that the operations of disembarking them, marching them across the Desert, and then re-embarking them, would make the overland route longer in point of time, as it certainly is greater in point of cost and of difficulty, than the uninterrupted voysge by the Cape. Bub we are supposing several things which ought not to be supposed. We are suppoeing that the Government had at call a number of stearaers proportionaate in carrying power to the 76 trans. ports that have been despatched as rapidly as the troons could be colleeted at the points of embarkation. And the theory requires the still larger supposition that suth a crowd of steamers could be placed upon any route without a great amount of previous arrangement, such as the supplying of coaling stations. To all appearance and calculation, if the Governmenthad waited til it waspracticable to send thereinforcements by steam and the land route, not one-third of the forces now at sea, and the earliest of which are probably this week sighting Calcutta, wonld have yet been got away from our own sbores. But a greater diffioulty still n transnor'ing armiesby the overland route has to be encountered when the seal again reachedon the other side of the iathmns. Suppose it practicable to have procured a suffiolency of steamers to carry the troops from here to Alexandria, could we have expected to obtain in sufficient time aproportionate number to be waiting in the Red Sea ? And even snpposing there to be no impossibility in that, the dangers of numerous and large vessels, with crews new to the navigation, traversing that sea, are self-manifest, and have received proof in the wreck of the chief of the two or three steamers sent tha' route with troops. It is much more than probable that an attempt to send any large proportion of the troops by the overlaud route wrould ha.ve only illustrated v6ry signally the proverbial fallacy of " short cuts " in general, and the utter impracticability of this one in partioular.-SC0oPU,1,
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. - -----lt Sir,-There is one point of view in which the general revolt of the Bengal native army haa to be considered that does not seem to have received the attention it deserves. British troops as they arrive in India are sent to fight battles with the mutineers in complete isolation and without support or assist- ance in the field from any class of the population. I This Is the case in the whole length and breadth of! the Gangetic valley. The races of the Punjab and of the Northern Mountains, who differ in habit and in religion from the men of the plains, have indeed fumished quotas to act with the British troops against Delhi, and the Affghans of our extrame trans-Indus frontier have offered their services and are enlisting freely, and to all appearance these men also wiiU prove trustworthy under the hope of rich booty in the capture of Delhi, besides the regular pay and further favours held out to them in promise. But these auxiliaries, though by their aid the Punjab wil be secured, and a most im portant succour has been thrown forward to act against Delhi, wiiU yet be of no avail to assist the British regiments forwarded from the Presidency, and it is these which will have to recover the territory and to re-establish the prestige of British power which has been lost in the wide tract west of the Jumna, extending nearly to the Soane and Gunduck rivers. The serried ranks and teady fire andimpetiouschargeof the Anglo-Saxons have hitherto always won, and will continue to win, us the victory against any odds of number. Bu the victory is not as destructive to the foe as it should be, for want of the cavalry and light troops that were heretofore furnished by our allies, and latterly had been formed by ourselves on the model of their troops, by the offer of pay to the soldiers by profession who have always abounded in India. These now are not to be trusted, or have turned against us, and the European regiments with their artillery fight, as I before said, the battles of their country alone and unsupported. Victory folows their standard, and wherever they appear they triumph; but what is to follow these sweceasse? If the army when it has destroyel every body of mutineers and scattered our enemies of every kind wherever they have ape peared in arms, to be split up into regiments or wings, in order to be cantoned a, the stations where there are gaols and treasuries, and as a necessary support to the civil power? Can we look to our European soldiery as the fature in. struments of police and revenue administration ? Clearly not. They must be stationed in divisions, each of strength sufficient to overawe a province, and so posted along the direct line leading through the heart of Hindostan, while the civil administra tion of the districts on either side must be conducted as heretofore by a knot of British functionaries, in each aided only by native officials and with local corps of natives suitably armed to form the gaol and treasury guards. No one can possibly contemplate a different organization than this for the future local administration of BengaL There wil be much argument, of course, about the proper constitution to be given to the native guards by which the mutineers and disbanded regiments wil have to be replaced. It is a very serious question; and it is to be presumed that i; will be the study of the authorities who will have to decide it to make the organization and the classes of men employed as various and multitudinous as possible, so as to prevent any set of men from corn. bining except locally and with few associates. The mistake of having a native army of one organization exceeding 100,OV0 in number will I presume, never be committed again. Still, whatever be the form given to the new police and administrative forces, they must, as I have said, be native, and the British functionaries must live in isolation among them, exposed to the risk of cons piracy and treachery and to all the possible violence of outbreaks. The way must be paved for a restoration of things on this basis; means muit be found of preventing when it can be done, and of sootbing and removing when it has been produced, any such alienation of feeling between the Europeans and the natives as would prevent them acting and associating together in confidence and with mutual goodwill. No one will dispute for a moment that such is the course of wisdom, and ought to be the aim of our policy. Are we going the right way to accomDlish this end? That is the all-important question. The revolt is justified by the mutineers themselves on the one plea, that they suspected Government of a design to make them Christian. There is too much reason to fear that the suspici.on was entertained by many more than the Sepoys; but these only-whether acting upon the impulse of their own feeiings or instigated and urged by the intrigues of others is immaterial-have risen in arms for the defence of the caste and creeds they have imagined to be the objects of attack by the Government. The Government of India has seen the vast importance of preventing the population at large fromn participating in this feeling of suspicion and taking part with the mutineers. Lord Canning has published a proclamation, denying the imaputed desigus, and pledgiag the G[overnment not to interfere vrith any one's religion or caste, or to change at all the policy by which the British nation has hitherto been guided in this respect. I believe this proclamation to have been effectual in allaying much of the suspicion so widely entertained, and if the population of Bengal and of much of Hindostan also has kept aloof from the revolt, and shown a preference even for the old rule under which they have so long lived in peace, I doubt not it has been owing to their distrust of the Sepoy pretence that religion and caste were in danger, and to the confidence derived from past experience, and confirmed by the above proclamation, that neither their religious observances nor the customs and traditions they held in reverence would be at all interfered with by their British rulers. This proclamation has been approved and confirmed by the home authorities-that is, by the Court of Directors and by Her Majesty's Minister i. It is unfortuniate that it was not specially referred to with approbation in the resolution moved by Lord John Russell in the debate upon the Indian mutinies brought on by MIr. Disraeli; but the Goverament of this country is not the less pledged to the principle of complete toleration,and to an abstinence on the part of the Government from any interference with caste and creed, and from any measures devised with the special aim of destroying them. Notwithstanding this, and with a full knowledge of the pledge thus given, there is an agitation getting up in every part of England-it is more visible in the provincial than in the London presswith the avowed object of compelling the Government of lndia to act more decidedly than hitherto in aid of missionary and other eforts to oonvert the populationto Christianity,andtotakeamoredecidedly hostile part against the creeds, the caste* and the superstitions of India. I was extremely sorry to see this line taken by a Peer of such high character as Lord Shaftesbury. The pulpit, too, has taken up the cry, and one can scarcely attend any popular church or chapel without hearing some such doctrine from the pulpit. Now, does it not occur to those well-meaning persons that by urging the adoption of such a course for the future they are urging the Government to do the exact contrary of what it is pledged to do ? The mere agitation of the question even m the spirit they discuss it must have the efiect of neutralizinu the proclamation which has been so published by the Governor-General and approved by the home authorities. It must lead the people of India to doubt their sincerity, and to regard the proclamation as mere " words of the mouth," expended to gain a present purpose, but never meant to be followed up in action. Will the population of India abide in the feeling of security in the matter of caste and creed, which has kept them aloof from the revolt, if this agitation proceeds, and should appear likely to succeed in influencing the conduct of those who rule their destinies ? Assuredly not. We shll have the entire population of India permanently alienated and doubting our good faith, and under such an alienation what will be the eondition of all those devoted servanta who, honest themselves, and conducting tlhemselves so as to win everywhere respect and confidence, will be compromised by the distrust, and become, like too many of our unfortunate officers and civilians of the present day, the innocent victims of a feeling roused among the natives by plausible imputations of duplicity in the higher authorities such as to alarm them for their caste and religion T I go entirely1 along with those who press on the authorities the necessity of allowing less of caste in. fluence to find its way into the ranks of the native soldiery. This is matter of detail in the reorganizttion of regimernts and corps that can be arranged at the time of enlistment, without any breach of the pledge given by the Government not to interfere with anyone's religious belief. But the avowed purpose of the present agitation is to compel the Government of India to give more direct encouragement than heretofore to endeavours to make the population Christian-to make it more hostile than heretofore to the religions and superstitions in which the masses have been educated, and in which they still glory. It is this move that, if successful, will range the entire population against us, and make it impossible, notwithstanding the most brilliant succeasion of victories, ending in the annihilation of the mutineers in arms, to conduct a local administration upon any terms. The present revolt is sui generis. There is nothing like it in history to furnish a beacon to guide us out of the difficulty, because there never was a State w%hich rested for support upon such an army. But there is an analogous case of general revolt by an armed population of heathens occasioned by simnilar supicions entertained of a design in the Government to convert them to Christianity. The Calmucks of the Volga rose en masse on this account in the midst of winter, and, after destroying the Rusian public officers and settlers, moved in three bodies towards tbe frontier of China; and though set upon by the Cossacks of theroute, andopposed by all the troops that could be gathered to stop them, the entire nation made good their march, and were settled by the Chinese Emperor Kanghi in the valley of Eli. This was in the reign of the Empress Catherine, and it has taught the Russians the necessity, not only of observing strictly the principle of toleration in their dealings with races and tribes of a different faith, but the extreme danger of adopting measures that will give any colour to imputations or raise the suspicion of a design in the governing authority to change a religion. Is Eugland less wise than Russia, less endowed with prudence and prescience in matters of State policy affecting the administration of races of different religions? It is to ba hsoped not. I am, Sir, yours, b., P.
CARDINAL WISEMAN, Cardinal Wiseman presents his compliments to the Editor of The Times, and begs to caU his attention to the following passage in an article which he did him the honour of devoting to a sermon of his, delivered at Salford, in his paper of the 14th, which absence from home has prevented him from sooner noticing:- F Por the outrages, the horrors, the Insults, the atrocities of the Indian mutinies the Cardinal does not care one straw. Would a man with a single particle of an Englishman about him have passed over the whole of that horrible scene?" The Cardinal's object is not in the least to protest against the attribution of such a character to himself, or to any other Christian, Englishman or otherwise, but to call attention to the simple fact that the sermon alluded to was delivered on the 26th of July, when only the first newvs of the mutiny of 28,000 Sepoys, with none of the accounts in detail of atrocities, &c., bad been made known.. Yet he did not pass over in silence so much as had reached England, as the following passage, comprised in the extracts in The Times of the 12th, will show:- " An,! really upon this dishonesty for a trifle, for this miFerable gain, which some one or other has maade (in the cartridges), we have had 28,000 men thrown into rebellion; we have had officers murdered in cold blood by their own soldiers; we have had men, women, and childrenbutchered in the most brutal manner; we have had a large presidency thrown into a state of rebelllon; and we know not what tomorrowv may bring us of further dismay. All this may be the result of one pettycomnmercial attempt at unjust gain." (The subjcot here wras the duty of oommerclal honesty to keep up the Einglish character abroad.) Some readers will, perhaps, agree that, so far as news of atrocities had then reached us, this was not "passing over the whole of that horrible scene ," the worst had not then come to hand. But the Cardinal cannot consider it fair or just, if wilfully done, to have suppressed all allusion to the date of his discourse, especiaUy at the head of the extracts given on Saturday, the 12th, preparatory to the leader on Monday, where it is described as "delivered on Sunday," an expression which, as well as many phrases in the article, would lead the public to suppose that it had been only just delivered, certain'y not that it had been preached six weeks before. This may, indeed, have been an oversight, owing to the writer in the paper not having considered it worth his while to read the published discourse before criticizing it, as otherwise he must have seen the date of its delivery on the titlepage; and the Cardinal is unwiling to believe that the date was purposely suppressed to give more pungency to the unamiable, and even inhuman, character attributed to him in the article. He has therefore desired a copy of the sermon itself to be forwarded to the Editor, who will thereby also see that what he has described a3 its sole drift and aim is, in fact, only a very small proportion of a lengthy discourse on many other topics; and that it joins Piedmont with Naples, Spain, and France, as no less than they are objects of revolutionary schemes, involving bloodshed and the use of the torch and the dagger on the part of refugees w;ho plot in security among us. The Cardinal, in conclusion, appeals to the fairness and the courtesy of the Editor of The Times for the insertion of this note. York, Sept. 16.
THE ENGLISrr IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TErE TIMES. Sir,-In The Tinms of the 15th inst., in a report of a meeting held at Liverpool in aid of the sufferers by the Indian mutinies, Mr. V. Rathbone is said to have thus expressed himself:- "He was, however, convinced that a great sin lay at our door, as well as at the door of others, and he wished it to be remembered that some of our military men, and others engaged in the civil service in India, had been the cause of a great deal of the ill-feeling which had brought this about. He did not want to be told that our countrywomen had suffered wrongs worse than death a thousand times, and he did not want to mitigate their feelings in this respect: bnt he did believe that the treatment of native womaen by some of those to whom hi3 bad referred had been one caluse of the strong feeling which had manifested itself in the Indian atrocities. He trnsted that we should lay that deeply to heart." I do not wish to charge Mlr. Rathbone with that cheapest and easiest form of confession which consists im confessing the sins of others; but if the above is the complete substance of his remarks he is guilty of scattering those woces in tdlgum amlniuas which are the origin of the greater part of those calumnies respecting the conduct of the English in India which are current throughout Europe, and which are constantly inthe mouths of those who hate us because they envy our power and renown. I have served the Honourable Company for nearly 30 years in many posts which have brought me into hourly intercourse with the people of all castes and classes, and I deny Mr. W. ]tathbone's assertions in their full extent. England knows what the mutineers have donenot entirely, for English ips can hardly frame the words to express some of their acts-but in my 30 years' experience I never heard, even in a whisper, of any act of violence on the part of any Englishman to the honour of a native woman in India such als Mr. W. Rathbone hints at. Concubinage was formerly very common, and still exists to a partial extent. In the course of my experience I remember only one case of what we call seduction, and that occurred 25 years ago far remote frona the scenes of these atrocities. The intercourse of English men with Indian women 1 distinctly affirrm to have been dishonourtng to our own race only, and that our treatment of the na tives in this respect has stood in bright contrast with their treatment of each other. I trust that your admission of this letter in your columns will suggest to Mr. V. Rathbone the propriety of expressing himself more clearly on this subject, and of stating openly and boldly the particular instances to which he refers, that they may be either substantiated or denied. As it is, he has added another bitter drop to the overflowing cup of our misery. Your obedint ei-rvant A POLITICAl QFFICE& Sept. 17.
TEB INDIAN MUTINIES. THE ARR.A. EXPEDITION The following details respecting the expedition to Arrah are taken from the Homewward Mail from India, published in London on the 16th inst. " Since our summary and the other portions of onr nlewspaper were in type intelligeno, of the gravest and most ptaiful character has reached us. This intelligence is of a natare to modify to a very considerable extent tha opinicna we have expreswed as to the general character of the news received by the present matL As we believe it to be anthentio we should be wantiog in our daty as journalists fwe refrained from making it public, though we appreciate the anxiety it will oocasion to many of our readers, and deeply regret that we are at present unable to satisfy their impatience by a more detatied accounL It appears that the mutineers from Dinapore, after quitting that station, advaned against Arra, a large civUl atton, 25mileswestof Dinapore, the residents at whioh place were unfortunstely soegulneof their ability to resit an attack for a time, and are said to have applied for a detachment of European troops, in place of adopting the more pradent cous of a retreat. The result was that the whole of the Europeans at the station,to the number of about 50, were massacred. This disastrons event was succeeded by another. Two steamers had been despatchod with troops for the relief of Arrah; one of them grounded, and we have no further information respecting it; from the other a body of 200 European troops were landed, and fell into an ambush, where nine offcers and upwards of 100 men are said to have been cut off. The importance of these events, considering the command they give the mutlneers of the line of communication between Calcutta and Benares, cannot but be obvious to every one. This intelligenco will perhaps serve to explain to our readers the report which has ap. peared in a leading journal regarding the fall of Agra, the similarity of the names having probably led to the mistake." In Thornton's Gazetteer of Indua we find the fol- lowing:- " Arrah, in the British distriet of Shahabad, Presidency of Bengal, a town on the route from Dinapore to Gha20pore 25 miles west of the former, 75 east of the latter. SuppUles and water are abundant, the surrounding country being fertUe and well cultivated, and a large and beautiful lake being close to the town.

TRE IADIAN MlfASSACRES. SBRERWRTtrlRV In compliance writh a communication received from the Lord Mayor of London, Lr. \Y. Harley Bayley, mayor of tbis borough, convened a meeting of the inhabitants in the Gulidhall yesterday. His worship presided, and the attend. anre included several of the more influential gentlemen of the toven. Tho CnI. R-IIAN, in opening the proceedings, expressed the pleasure it gave him to call the innabihants together for such a purpose, observing that there was a peculiar reason wby thev should show their sympathy for those who had suffered hy the Indian atrocities, Inasmuch as the empire of India was wnvo for this country by a Stiropahire man. After comlenting on the barbarities which had been committed upon our countrymen in the East the Chairman urged the neceity of a prompt and terrible retribution on the fiend- gr. ldermat How proposed the following resolution:- "This meeting, deegly sympathizilnrith the unhappy eutfers br the late sbarbxoneontragosin British IndI, I3 anixious t3 testity It cordial ooncurrenoe with the en earonr to allerlae, so far as hurnst aldca avaiL. thoeepriratonsaund distresse3. Iti3 reolved, therefore, that a subeeiption be now opened In aid or the frnd oommeneod by :be Lord Mayor of London and eanctioned by our most gr4cious Sove 1 eIans appioraLl England had been mercifully spared the horrors and cala - mities of war, for under all cireumstances her home3 and her altars had been preserved sacred, and be thought we ought to show our gratitude to Almighty God for such blessingsbysubscribingliberallyin aid of thosev who had suffered hy the barbarities perpetrated in India. The Eev. B. 1I KESXNXDY, D.D., in seconding the resolution, commented on the tact that Clive, Cureton, and wEdrardes were all Shropahire men, and that therefore the object of the present meeting had trong claims on the sympathy and support of all Shropshire people. The resolution was caried unanimously. MJr. RouEavSO, C.B., proposed, "That the Mayor be requested to act as troanrer of the local tcnd, and to transmit the amount to the general committee in London." He urged that those who intended to give shonld give at once, Jor those who gave quickly gave twico. The British empire was struck in a vital part by men whom she had nursed, and who had repaid her kindness by committing hitherto unheard-of barbarities. He thought the eause of eternal justice demanded a prompt and terrible retribution, so as to maintain our empire intact and prevent the occurrence of similar atrocities in future. The Rev. J. YARDLXY, vicar of St. Chad's, seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. Other resolutions of a formal character were also carried. On the motion of Mr. W. COOPn, seconded by Mr. S. SMITH, a vote of thanks was accorded to the chairman. A subscription list was immediately opened, the Mayor heading it with 0L. Before the meeting separated 100L was subscribed. MANCHESTER. A requisition is to be presented to the Mayor of Manchester this morning, calling upon his worship to summon a public meeting to commenoo a subecription for the relief of the unfortunate sufferers by the revolt in Izdia. It is understood that the meeting wi be fixed for Thursday next. TrE IxNDrA MAIL.-The portion of tho India niail that arrived yesterday mornin consisted of 16 cases from |Bombay only.

BA3NK OF ENGLAND MELTING. Yesterday, at noon, the usual balf-yearly General Court of lProprietors of the Bank of England was held in the Bank parlour. the Governor (Mr. Sheffield Neave) in the chair. The minutes of the two formuer Courts having been read and confirmed, The GovnxtsoR said,-I have now to acquaint the Court that this is one of the quarterly general courts apPointed by the Charter, and also one of the half-)early general courts appointed by the 12th bg-law for miakiog a dividend. The net profts of the half-:-ear ending tbe 3ibt of August hat wrere 7X3,6601., making the amount of the rest ou that day 3,840.6251. is. 3d.; and, after prolviding for a dividend at the rate of fl.' per cent, for the hlf year, the rest wdill be 3,040,2101. iTs 3d. The Court of Directors, therefore, propose that a h*lf-year's dividend of interest and profits be muade on the 10th of Ootober of 51. 106. per cent., withoat ary deduction on account of income-tax. Mr. PILCUER.-Although there is an increase in the dividend, perhaps I may be allowed to ask how it is that it is still so small as compared with the divideud declared by the banks In the nelghbocrhood ? They (the " young ladies," as I may caU them) are declaring dividends of 15 or 20 per cent., but our establishment, the " old lady," only divides 11. How is It that with larger profits than the other banks our dividend is yet less ? The Gov3RYORs.-'rhe difference is easily explained. It is rather nominal than real. and is this :-TThe banks to wvhich you allude have small capitals, and therefore the profit they make-altbough less than ours-enables thein so divide upon their small capital the larger dividend. The Bank of England has 14,000,0001. of capital, and, although its profits may be larger than those of the younger banks, Iat nominally they will not yield the same rate of interest as the profits of those banks. Mr. PILC11ER.-Yes, Sir; but how much of our capital do wve keep uDemployed ? The GOVER-OXt.-We have none unemployed beyond that which as prudent bankers we are bound to keep in hand. Mr. PILCIIEL-Then it natura'ly follows that we do not employ onr capital as well as the young banks- the "young ladies," as I have coalled them-do theirs. Mr. li. CLARBE.-We have earned 840,0001., and are goitg to divide 800,0001. of that. The divibion will tako place upon 14,000,0U00 of capital, which is equal to 1,600,0001., uponhalf that capital The working capital of our bank is only about 3,000,0001. Mr. PILHEI.-But w,hy should we8 not employ more of our- capital ? The GOVERNOB.-WVe are naturally in our position obliged to keep a much larger reserve than private bankers. The question that the dividend be declared payable on and after the 10th of October next was then put and carried unanimously. The GovyRSOR.-I have now to inform the Court that as The present rate of dividend exceeds that of the last half. vear it is necessary, under the provisions of the Act of Par. liament, that the same should be confirmed by ballot in the cuRtoniary manner; and I have now therefore to move that this court do stand adjourned till Wednesday, the 22d inst., at 4 o'clock, then to take the determination of the proprietors by way of ballot upon the question of dividend. The motion wss agreed to. Mr. M. CrL.,sir.-It only remains for us now to pass a vote of thanks to the Court of Directors. This half-year the dividend is 5.J per cent.; but if it had only been 4A, I think the thanks of the Court would be equaLy dne to thiem, because theyhave kept in view what is just towards the proprietors, and at the same time have not shit out commercial interests. (fear, hear.) To a certain extent they are the regulators of the monetary system of the country, and they are not always masters of their own proceedings; but the manner in which they govern the whole exhibits so -,uch discretion, prudence, and ability, that they deserve our best thanks. (ear, hear.) I there'ore think it is only due to them that they should receive an expression of onr public approbation of their past conduct. (Eiear. Mr. Alderman SALUOo?mS.-I have great pleasure in secondinz that motion. In all my experience of these cours tli3s is the first time I have heard any one speak in the language of complaint about a large increase of dividend. (Hear, hear.) I suppose, however, that there is in our constitution something which gives rise to a feeling that the more we get the more we want. ("Hear," and a laugh ) 1'erhaps, therefore, I may be allowed to hope that, consist. ently with what is due to the public, it may,be in the power of the Court of Directors to give us an increased dividend. (Hear, hear.) Permit me to say, in seconding this motion, that we have every reason to be satisfi. d with their conduct and with the manner in which they have managed the affairs of the Bank. It is not too much to say, by one who has read the evidence given by members of the Court of Directors before Parliament, that there never was a period when the character of the Governor anrd the Court stood higher than it does now, or when greater effect was produced upon a Parliamentary committee than was produced by that evidence, with reference not only to the interests of the proprietors, but to those of the public. (EHear, hear.) The resolution was carried by acclaumation. The GOVFRtNOR.-Gentlemen, in the name of my colleagues, I beg to return you our sincere thanss for the laudatory resolution which you have just passed. I can assure you that in the difficult and arduous duties which develve upon those who have the managenment of this corporation it is always to them a source of encourag nt and support if they can receive the approbation of their proprietary. (Hear.) I may also add that it must be agreeable to all when those who have the conduct of the aftairs of a great national institution, and who are necessarily obligedto whom it is a duty-to keep in view the public interest, can at the same time meet their proprietors, and ascertain from them that they are of opinion that we have not sacrificed their interests, but have rather attended to the general advantage of the proprietors at large. (Ilear, hear.) The Court then adjourned.
HOW TO FILL THE BANKS OF OUR ARMY. TO THE EDITOR OF TRE TIMES. Sir,-The lest Horse Guards' plan of giving an ensigns commission to any gentleman who raises 100 men for the army wiiU prove a failure. So will that now said to be in contemplation-a lieutenant-colonelcy to any one previously serving with field rank who brings in 1,000 men. It Is very evident, however, when a bonus of this kind is held out that recruiting by the ordinary means is not quite as successful as expected. The present rate at which recruits are being obtained would scarcely make up the augmentations of existing regiments. It would certainly be insufficient to meet the gaps which harassing campaigns under an Indian sun are unfortunately too certain to make in an army of S0,000 men. In the meantime how are we to make up the 15 second battalions ordered to be immediately enrolled? The officers are already appointed to four of those corps, but I venture to say in each thoy have not yet under their command 200 mnen. As we go on now I calculate it wvould take at leasb 18 months to fill up those 15 battalions. What then is the remedy? The Militia. All rustics are nervous about soldiering at first. They like to steal into it throqgh the militia. A few weeks' training gives them the air and demeanour of soldiers. The awkwardness auid the fear are flung aside. And when they know themselves to be bold, confident, firmly-treading men, thoy begin to feel rather ashamed to linger at home when fame is to be gained abroad ; and now in their gregarious state they encourage each other In a manner that would not occur to them a s individuals. So they volunteer, and go forth to battle, boldly and gladly. I humbly, therefore, submit a plan by which the 15 Line battalions can be raised before twvo months. Call out several of the strong Militia regimentsnone under an eight company corps. When each is recruited to any number over 800 (the number required for a second battalion of the Line) 1,t a circular be addressed to the commanding officer, informing him that, should his regiment be disposed to volun. teer with a strength of not less than 800, they will be kept together and placed as a second battalion in one of Her Majesty's regiments of the Line; that half the number of the field officers, of the captains, and of the subslterns will be appointed to Her Majesty's regular service with their prese: t rank, and in the same regiment with their men; and that the adjutant will receive an increase of 2s. per day to his pay, or a bonus of 500C. See, now, how this would work both for the Militia and the Line. The system during the la:e war was to give an ensigns commission to a militia officer on 70 men being furnished by the regiment. The officer likely to be a candidate for this was generally of the least influential class in the regiment-a young subaltern. If the colonel and the captains had an interest _ providing for a popular young officer or in getting rid of a young blackguard, they used their influence, and the men went. If the feeling were otherwise, either the men were discouraged to volunteer under the rose or a pas. sive assent waS given. By the proposition which I ven. ture to submit all the influential men in the corps would find it their interest to carry the men to tho Line. There are probably four field ofHcers; two of those possibly have served in the Line before, or are young miea ambitious of seeing military service; the two who remain obtain miii. tia promotion or seniority by thed,parture of the others. So it is with the captains and the subalrern8; and the adjutant, who is about the most influential man in a Militia regiment, has a direct pecuniary interett in sending o,st the men, which is only right, as he would have the chief trouble in raising and drilling recruits to replace those who go. Nor wvould they be slow in ooming forward. Trsenarneforspirit and patriotism obtained by the volunteering of the old reginment, the new officers who would be appointed, the general desire of all classes to close the gap so nobly made, would soon bring recruits enough flocking to the fresh corps. As regards the Line, too-the pinching oint with the authorities who take any liberty you ike about tuaking changes of system regarding the men, but who hbte to stray an inch from the beaten track in the case of officers, I say, as regards the Line, the infusion of a little militia.officer blood would be rather a service than an injury. A regiment with a second battalion aeems to have told off as its strength of regimental officers six field offdcers, 20 captains, and 40 subalterns. Surely one or two field officers, four captains (men of some wealth and county standing iu those ranks), and eight subalterns would be no monstrous or disagreeable infusion. hlauy of those would probably be men who had spent their early years in Line regiments. Some would quit the service soon, and thus give promotion, and all would come on with a secoad battalion, whicb, according to the recent Gaszcu4s, gives no promotion in the regiments. Thus none would be stopped. This, Sir, is my plan. I stake my existence on itg perfect success if routine would only give it a trial and I am quite ready myself, on those conditions, to bring to the Line 800 Men before this day two months. I am your obedient iaz-+n A FIELD OFFICERdv OIZl7m.
CENTRAL ORIMINAL COURT, Sept. 17. OLD COTMJT. (BefOre Mfr. Jiuticc CC0oSPTo and Mr. Baron WATrso?.) THB MURDER IN HORSERONGEP.LANE GAOL. James Preston, 64, was indicted for the wilful murder of John Hodges. Mrr.Robinson conducted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by M:r. Sleigh. The prisoner appeared to be in a very distressed state of mind. He was aUowed to be seated during the trial, and seemed to be hardly conscious of what asa going on. While IYr. Robinson was opening the case to the jury Sir. Justice CROMFPTON took occasion to complain of the very ilegible manner in which the depositions were written, and said that some of the most important portions of them it 'was almost impossible to read. The depositions were the only means the Court had of becoming acquainted with the nature of the inquiry that was likely to come before it, and it was very essential, therefore, that they should be written so that they could be read, or else the object of having depositions was entirely defeated. The case waas then gone into, but, as the whole of the facts have been given very fuly within the last few days, it will be unnecessary to give the evidence in detail. At the time of the occurrence the prisoner and the deceased were confined in Horsemonger-lane prison-the former for debt and the latter upon a charge of felony. The prisoner, it appeared, had been in confinement for nearly three months, and during nearly the whole of that period the surgeon of the prison entertained an opinion that he was not right in his mind; but he seemed to be perfectly harmless, and, chiefly with a view to his own protection, as from the symptoms he exhibited there appeared to be some ground for believing that he might commit violence upon himself, he was on the 'th of September placed in the iufirmary ward of the prison. l'he deceased, who was subject to fits, was also in the infirmary, and two other prisoners were also there, the whole four having separate beds. About 4 o'clock on the morning of the 6th of September the prisoner was seen to get out of his bed and go to a cupboard, where there was a heavy pail, and he took out this pail and went to the bed where the deceased was lying asleep, and before any one cotuld interfere to prevent him, hestruckthedeceased several blows on the head with tbe pail, and inflicted such severe injury upon-him that he died almost immediately. The prisoner at this time wvas very violent, and made use of several incoherent exclamations, one of which was, " He is a wooden dolly-he has seduced my wife, and it serves him right." But a day or two afterwards, when he had become more composed, he said he did not know what had possessed him to do it, as the deceased was very kind to him. Mir. Keene, the governor of the prison, who was examined as a witness, said that from the moment the prisoner 'was admitted to the gaol he always considered him to be of unseund mind. Latterly he appeared to be very depressed and low-spirited, and by order of the surgeon he was sent to the infirmary ward, where he would be constantly watched. He was always quiet, and never exhibited the least violence, and the only apprehension entertained of him was that he might commit suicide. Mr. fliff, the surgeon acting in the absence of Mr. Harris, the regular sargeon of the prison, said that he had seen the prisoner for about fortinight before the transaction every day, and he was of opinion that he was of unsound mind. it was by his direction that the prisoner was sent to the infir. mary. In answer to a question put by Mr. SLEIGH this witness said he was of opinion that at the tune he committed the act the prisoner 'as in such a state of mind as not to know that he was doing a wrong act, or to be aware of the consequences that were likely to result from it. Mr. Gibson, the surgeon of Newa'gate, gave similar evi- The jury, without hearingthe counsel for the prisouer at this stage of the case expressed tdemselves satisfied, and returned a verdict of Not ruitty on the ground of insanity, and the prisoner was ordered to be detained during Her Ma3jesty's pleasure. THE hIURDER IN TEIE HAMPSTEXD-ROAD. Cornelius Denny, 26, 'was indicted for the wilful murder of Gabo Benronelli, Mrz. Cooper prosecuted ; MIr. Payne defended the prisoner. The learned counsel for the prosecution having briefly opened the case, the following evidence was adduced: John Gibson said,-I am an errand boy. On Saturday, the 23d of Augest, about 12 o'clock at night, I went into an iceshop In Adam's-row, Rampstead-road. The prisoner and his wife and brother-in-law came in soon afterwards The prisoner was drunk, but not very drunk, and he fell asleep, and the deceased, who was serving in the shop, tried to awake him, and after some time he succeeded in doing Eo. The deceased first threw some water in his face and then ut some Ice down his back. This did not awake him, and ne then put a second piece of ice down his back, and thin awoke the prisoner, and the master of the shop and the deceased tried to get him out, and he fel down, and when he got up the deceased pushed him out with one of the shutters of the shop. The prisoner endeavoured to get into the shop, and the deceased tried to stop him, and the prisoner struck him in the face. The deceased then tried to kick the prisoner, and followed him up for that purpose, and after a short time be turned back and got a stick. While he was gone the prisoner said, "Let him come," and the deceased then went up to him and tried to strike him with tbe stick, but did not do so. The prisoner and the deceased then laid hold of each other and began scuffling together, and two policemen came up and took the prisoner to the station. house. I followed, and as they were going along I saw the wife of the prisoner drop a knife, and I picked it up, and it was afterwvard given to a police-constable, Cross-examined.-The parties all remained in the shop from 12 until past 2 o'clock. The reason witness was out so late was that he had lost 8d., and was afraid to l go home. (A^ laugh,) WMhen they put the second piece of ice down the prisoner's back it suede him shudder, but he did not awake, The prisoner tried to get away from the deceased as well as he could while he was endeavouring to strike him wvith the stick. The prisoner was cut upon the face and mouth. Giuseppe Barrotti said,-I am the proprietor of the shop in question, and the deceased was in my service. He was 21 years of age. I was in my shop on the night of the 23d of August, and reniember seeing the prisoner come in, accompanied by PA man and a woman, and he put himself in a chair and went to sleep and slept until nearly 3 o'clock, when I told Benzoneli to shut up the shop and tell the prisoner and his companions to go away. The deceased svent to the prisoner and sasid, "Come, get up, get up." The prisoiner wuuld not go, and I went to him and said," My lad, this won't do; it is late and you must go." He got up and began to swear, and said to the deceased, " I'll crack your head*" Upon hearing this I went tothe window to look for a policeman, and I then saw the prisoner's wife pull2ing him by the coat, and the deceased was pushing him behind, and in this way be was got out of the shop. The deceased was then about to put up the shutters, and the prisoner said to him, "' You are a - rogue, and a - Frenchman," and struck him three blows behind the ear, and the deceased defended himself by trying to kick the prisoner, but I could not see whether he actua ly kicked him or not. I went out to try to separate them, and the deceased went into the shop and procured a stick, and flourished it as though about to strike the prisoner, and at this instant the prisoner rushed at the deceased, as I suppose, with a knife, but I could not see it. The deceaFed struck the prisoner once with a stick, and I then took the stick from him, and he at the same time exclaimed am wounded, I am wounded !" I examined him, and saw that he was wounded in the abdomen, and his bowels were coming out. I afterwards saw the deceased at the University Hospital, and he was then dead. Cross-examined.-I am sure the prisoner did not come into the shop until nearly 2 o'clock. When the prisoner came into the shop I told the deceased not to trust him, as he had bad some article before and had not paid for it. I saw no ice put down the deceased's hack. I am quite sure there was no ice in the house at that late hour. Joseph Wood, a young lad, said,-I went into the shop about 3 o'clock in the morning and called for an ice, and saw the Last witness squaring at the prisoner, and after this the prioner struck the deceased, and he went in for a sick. The prisoner exclaimed, "Let him come, I have got a knife !" and pulled a knife out of his pocket at the same moment and opened it. There was then another struggle between the prisoner and the deceased, who had a stick in his band, and I saw the prisoner make a thrust towards the belly of the deceased. I am sure the deceased did not strike the prisoner with the stick. Cross-examined.-I was going out fishing. I had not been to bed. We boys generally go out fishing in hot weather at an early hour. (A laugh.) Joseph Stansleld, the brotber-in-law of the prisoner, was then called, and, in answer to questions put by Mr. PAYNE, said that he and the deceased were in the shop for more than two hours, ard the deceased was very much intoxicated. He also stated that the deceased twice put ice down his back, and while he was trying to get him out the prisoner fell down very heavily, and after this the deceased and his master pushed him forcibly out of the shop. Mr. Vincent Jackson, house surgeon at the Univer3ity Hospital, proved that he saw the deceased in that establishment about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 23d of Augus,. He was wounded in the abdomen, and a mass of bowels prmtraded from it. He died on Tuesday, the 25th, from the effects of the injury he had received. F. J. Hanley, a police constable, deposed that he went to the hospital and took the prisoner with him. and thc de- ceased made a stateznenCt in his p-re'sen-ce-i'n-the -Fren`c-h language. Witness understood what he said, and inter. preted it to the prisoner, wvho said that it was not true, as the dying man had stated that he had stabbed him in the street, and the deceased then said that he had stabbed him on the pavement. He told the prisoner what the deceased said, and he replied, "I am guilty ; I stabbed him." .Mr. PAYNE, in addressing the iury for the prisoner, sa?d, the prisoner had never attempted to deny that he had oemmittef- the a with which he was charged, and all he could do in his bebalf was to make such observations as he hoped would induce the jury to acquit the prisoner of the crime of wilful murder, and find him guilty of manslaughiter only. He then observed upon the provocation that had been given to the prisoner by water and ice being put down his back and by the deceased attacking him with a stck, and he urged that the prisoner had used the knife in the excitement and heat of the moment, with a view, as he supposed, to defend himself, and that, under the circumstances, his offence amounted only to manslaughter. Several witnesses were caUed, who described the prisoner as a good.tempered, peaceable man, and of a kmd and humane disposition, Mfr. Baron WAvSON having summ ed up. The jury, after a short deliberation, fond the prisoner guilty of m anslaughter, He was at once called up for judgment, and The learned JtUDGE sentenced bim to be kept in penal servitude for 10 years. Ane Donovan, 184 was indicted for feloniously stabbing and wounding George Gymar, vwith intent to murder him, Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clark conducted the prosecution. The prosecutor in this case is t. police constable, and it appeared that while on duty in the neighbourhood of Drury.lane he had occasion to take an idiot boy to the workhouse, and while so engaged the prisoner and a number of otherdisorderly characters interfered with bim, his hat was knocked off, and as he was picking it up be accidentaUy struck the prisoner a slight blow on the face, and she apeared very angry and uttered threats against him. Havlng taken the boy to the workhouse he returned to his duty, and the prisoner met him and said she had been home to get something for him, and, as it appeared, without any provocation, made a most savage attack upon him with a knife and stabbed him in the face and otber parts of his body, at the same time making use of the most fearful threats, one stab in the face being accompanied by tho exclamation that if she could not have the constable's life she would have his - eye out. The prisoner, when called upon for her defence, said, she was drunk and dd not know anything of what had happened. The jury found the prisoner Guilty of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr. BODIN informed the Court that the prisoner had been convioted of serious assaultaupon the female turnkeys of different prisons in which she had been confined, and she hadc also been repeatedly convicted of riotoas conduct and assaulting the pollce. Mr. Justice CRoMPTON, after observing upon the aggravated character of her offence, said, that the police must be protected in the proper discharge of their duty, and he then sentenced the prisener to be kept ia penal servitude for 10 years. The prisoner as she was leaving the dock exclaimed with great violence " R never do it-I'll never do it." William Edwin James Hillyar, a respectable-looking Lad, who surrendered to take his trial, was indicted for felony' in having unlawfully uttered as true and genuine a forged certificate of baptism with intent to defraud Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Sleigh conducted the proseca. 'ion on behalf of the Admiralty; Serieant Ballantine was specially retained for the defence with Mr. Lillev. Mr. PIrBBSDORFF in opening the case said, he regretted that the duty devolved upon him of preferring a charge of so serious a description against a young man so respectable as the prisoner and his family undoubtedly were, but the authorities of the Admiralty, feeling that a very mischievous offence had been committed, had no alter. native but to institute the present prosecution as a warning to all whom it might concern, that they incurred very great danger by commaitting an act of the description that was now the subject of inquiry. He then proceeded to explain that by an Order in Council, which, he said, was liD ely to be of a very beneficial character, all persons applying for appointments in the civil service of the Government were 'required to undergo certain examinations as to their fitness - and there were other regulationg to be complied witn, one ef which was with reference to the age of the applicants, and with regard to appointments in the Admiralty the youngest age at which any clerk could be appointed was 17. An application had, it an. peared, been made to the Addmiralty for an appointment for theprisoner, and he was directed to attend at the Admiralty f or the purpose of undergoinR the usual examination, and be did so on the 27th of July. Upon this occasion he signed a paper, by which be stated his age to be 17, and he at the same time produced a certificate of baptism, and the certificate of the register of birth, &c., by which it appeared that he was bon on the 22d of May, 1840. 'he gentleman to whom he gave the documents observed immediately that they had been tampered with, and that the date originaUy entered was 1842, and that the 2 had been erased, and an 0 substituted. The defendant attended on a subsequent day and underwent his examination, but apon all the facts coming to the knowledge of the Board of Ad. miralty they felt it to be their duty to direct that the pTesent indictment should be preferred. Mr. West, a clerk in the Admiralty, proved that the defendant was recommended for an appointment, and that the usual letter was sent requiring him to attend and be examined, He said he believed that the application for a situation was originally made by the prisoner's father. By one of the regulations of the Commissioners no personvwA eligible to an appointment in the Admiralty who was under 17 or over 25 years old. By Serjeant BALLA1N=E-The connexions of the defen. dant were higbly respectable. His father was an officer of rank on board the Agamemnon. Mr. Hua phries, the senior clerk in the Civil Service Com. missioners'-office, stated that the defendant came to him bv appointment, and he asked him to fiU in written answers tj certain questions, and he did so, and one of the answers he gave was that his age was 17 at his last birthday. The defendant then handed him two papers, one purporting to be a certificate of baptism, and the other a register of births, and he looked at tnem and saw at once that the dates had been altered from 1842 to 1840. He asked the prisoner if he was aware that the certificates had been altered, and he said he was, and he accounted for it by stating that Mr. Hatchard, the clergyman, had made a mistake in the datei, and that the documents had been sent back to him and that he had made the alteration. Witness told him that he could not give credit to his statement, but he persisted in stating that it was true, and he afterwards said that he sup. posed bis father knew something about it. By Serieant BALLAYTINE.-The appointment the defendant would have received was a temporary clerkship. He ecould non say what salary he would have received, but he would have been liable to be discharged at any momaent. The Rev. Mr. Hatchard, the vicar of St. Andrew's, Plymoutb, where the prisonerg family resided, proved that the date of the certificate of baptism had been altered from 1842 to 1840. By Serjeant BAnLLANTME.-He had known the prisoner from his childhood, and always considered him a very good boy, and his family were highly respectable. John Dennis, a person connected with the Westminster Police Court, proved that the prisoner told him that he was only 15 years old. Serjeant BALLANTL?.E made a most eloquent and feeling appeal to the jury on behalf of the prisoner. He called their attention to the peouliar nature of the charge, and said he hoped he sbould be able to induce them to come to i the conclusion that they were not bound uDon the evidence laid before them to come to a conclusion that the lad at the bar, who up to this moment had never had the sliehtest stain cast upon his character, had committed the offence that was sought to be established against him, and of whicb, if be should be convicted, the result must inevitably be to blast his hopes for the remainder of his days. He then proceeded to argue that there waS no evidence to show that the prisoner knew the statements in the documents were false, and said that it was much more probable some older person than the prisoner should have been guilty of the fraud, if any fraud had in point of fact been committed, than that he should have =sen the guilty party. The Rev. Mr. Chambers, the master of the Royal Naval School, was called as a witness for rbe defence, and he stated that the prisoner had been under his charge for five years, and that no complaint had ever been made again-t |Mr. Baron WATSONe, in summing UDf, said that of course it vas a very painful thing to convict a lad like the prisoner of so serious an offence as the one charged in the present indict. ment, but unhappily in courts of justice they were too frequently called upon to deal with painful cases; and he and they were bound to do their duty according to the evidence laid before them, and if an offence was made out they would be doing an injustice to the community, and would not be properly performing the duty that they had undertaken, if they did not return a verdict to that effect. The learned judge then observed upon the great importance of sustaining the integrity of instruments such as certificates of births, &c., and said that the question in the present case was whether it was established that the prisoner had uttered an instrument as a certificate of baptism the contents of which he must have known to be false. If this fact were made out to their satisfaction they were bound to return a verdict of guilty, but if they entertained any reasonable doubt upon the subject they would of course give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt and acquit him. The jury, after deliberating for a considerable time In the box, expressed a wish to retire. They left the court at 6 o'clock and returned at 7, when they gave a verdict of Not Guiltiy: There was a burst of applause when the verdict was delivered. NEW COURT. (Before Ie ERECORDsR.) William Weaver, 20, tailor, was indicted for robbery With I violence upon Benjamin BlaL-esly, and stealing from him his watch and guard. Mr. T. Salter prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh defeuded. It appeared that the prosecutor, a lad 16 years of age, was about 9 o'clock in the evening standing at the corner of milford-lano, Strand, when tke prisoner capme up and asked him to come down the lane and he would show him something. Upon their getting some distance down some man, apparentli drunk, ran against the prosecutor, upon which prisoner and two others knocked him down and stole his watch; prosecutor, however, managed to get up and follow the prisoner until he was taken into custody. The prisoner wans found Guilty, and sentenced to five years' penal servitude. Thomas Johnson, 38, tailor, was indicted for receiving a quantityof stillk, the property of George Res, well know. Sir. Ribton, IMr. Sleigh, and Mr. Orridge appeared. The prosecutor in the case is a silk mercer and draper in Great Ruessell-street, and upon the 30th of July his place was broken into and between 300l. and 4001, worth of property stolen. Upon the 22d of August Inspector Makenzie and ergeant Saith went to the lodgings of the prisoner, in Devonshire-street, King-square, where they found one piece of silk of a peculiar pattern and length which had been stolen from the prosecutor, and with this there were also some bills of the prosecutor's, which the prisoner took from the police, and destroyed by crushing them to pieces in a basin of coldwater. In the same room was found a quantity of burglars' implements, and also a rnemorandum relating to some silks and other property, evidently that stolen from the prosecutor's. The jury foand the prisoner G(uily, and he was sentenced to six years' penal servitude. Jean Baptiste Vavasseur, agent, was indited for obta;n. ing by false pretences from John MWligan and another 216 yards of alpaca, value 241. Mr. Metcalfe prosecuted, and Mr. Ribton defended. The prosecutors are warehoasemen, and the prisoner had gone ths during the absence of the senior manager in the .firm, and stati og himself to be an agent in warp.ane, in conjunction wath another man obtained the goods in queStio, twhich he said he wanted to send as a sample ao Germany, uat which he pawned upon tho same day for half their value. Re was convicted, and sentenced to 12 months' imprison. Charlotte Kinox Knox, a ladylike-looking woman, surrendered to take her tria for obtaining money from the East India Company by means offlse pretences Isir. Sericant Ballantine and M6r. Maule prosecuted, and Mr. Giffard was for the defence. Mr. Serjeant BALLANTLNE briefly opened the following case to theo jury :-The. defendant was the widowr of Captain Robert Waiter Knox, formerly of the East India Company's service, and in 3842 received a pension upon Lord Clive's Fund for Widows, which would cease upon her remarrying. She had remarried in 1855, but had gone on reeiving the pension down to thet present year, The defence about to be set up was a singular one if tre. The second mariage was not denied, but it was said that the Eecond h %bsnd being then a married man it was no mar. liege at'all Evidence was then given to show that down to JanUATT, 3857, she reoeived her pension as Mrsm Knox, but that in October, 1855, she was married at Antwerp to one Richard Osborne Cross, and had lived with him at Berkhlmpatead ashia wife. The XCODER said the difficulty was in identifying the defendant with the register of marnage from Antwerp. Mr. 3LL TINE.-Mr. Cross Is in court. Mr. Cross then got into the witness-box. The RXcoiDEB.-You cannot examine him. Mr. BALL&TIE,-No, but my learned friend can crossexamine him. Mr. GIFFARD to Mr. Cros.-Were you married previously to your marriage with this lady ? I was, but did not know that nmy first wife was alive. I had not seen her from 1843 until lately. I saw her lst Sunday fortnight at Brighton. Mr. BALLaNTri -You are sure of that. Witness.- She is now in court. The learned SXuRzXAT said that after what had trnspired, he should withdraw from the prosecution. The defendant was then discharged. It will be remembered that Thomas Diamond Evans and Captain Heary Thorne were, on the 20th ult., committed for trial at the Marlborough-street police court for an alleged attempt to extort money from the Hon. F. W. Cadogan, by means of a libelous and defamatory letter addressed to the Editor of The Times newspaper, reflecting upon Mr. Cadogan's character s Vioe-Chairman of the Submarine Telegraph Company. The case was expected to come on this day, and several witnesses were in attendancebut in th0 course of the sitting, Mfr. Serjeant PAneY (who appeared for the defendant Evvans) applied for a postponement of the trial until next session. He said he had just shown to his learned fiends Mr. Serjeant Bellantine and Mr. Bodkin, an affidavit setting forth the ab6ence of five or six mnaterial witnesses. As regarded one of those witnesses, Sir J. Carmichael, tho chairman of the company, he understood that gertleman was actually in town, though the affidavit stated that the attempt to serve him had entirely failed. It further stated that an attempt to subpona Mr. Brett and Mr. Edwards, two of the directors of the company, had also failed, both of thembeing outottown ; that twoclerks named Stephenswere now on leave of abeence from the office; that a Ur. Aram, formerly in the employment of the oompany, was out of town, and that his sister stated she was unable to give his address; that Mr. Seymour Clark, whose name was mentioned in the alleged libel, and whose presence was mogt essential, was in Switzerland; and that another witness was in St. Petersburg. The affidavit went on to say that all these were material and necessary witnesses, that it would be impossible for the defendant either to plead or take his trial in their absence, and that their attendance might, ie was beHeved, be secured next session. Mr. ROBINSON said, he appeared on behal of the other defendant, Mr. Thorne, and supported the application for post- ponement, Hislordshipvwas aware that under Lord CampgeUl'z Act they were entitled to plead justification, and as it was only that morning he had seen a copy of the indictment he wished to have time to consider what course he should adopt with respect to it. The REa Osins observed that the presence of the wit=nesses Was not required in order to plead. It was posible that another applcation for postponement might be made next session, and that thus there would be still further delay. In answer to Mr. Serjeant BALLArTh'-, Mr. Serjeant PARBy said, he did not think he ought to be asked now to state whether or not justification would be pleaded. Re would promise, however, that copies of the plea should be delivered to the prosecutors, at least four days before the beginning of next session. Mr. BALLAyTINE stated that he appeared on behalf of the Hon. Mr. Cadogan. whose character in the dischare of his duties was reflected upon by the libel complained of. That gentleman was most anxious that the case should be at once investigated, and most unwilling that any adjournment should take place. Certain statements, however, In the affidavit were strictly correct. Some of the gentlemen mentioned were undoubtedly absent. As to Sir J. Carmichael, he was absent when the affidavit was framed, but the prosecutor hearing that his presence would be desirable telegraphed for him, and he had accordingly travelled from theContinent on purpose to be present here to-day. With reference to Mr. Edwards it was a mistake to supposo that he was out of the way; he was at that moment on Cornhill * but as to Mr. Seymour Clark and the other persons alluded to in the affidavit, there could be no doubt that they were absent. As it was stated that their evidence was material, and as, however unwilling to have the case postponed, his client wvas anxious to challenge the most complete investiation, he would not oppose the application. Mr. Serjeant Pncy said, he would undertake that a copy of the plea should be supplied at least four days previous to the ensuing session. The RECORDER thought this a very reasonable proposition, but fetred that delay might take place if the day of trial were not fixced. It was then aanged that the trial should be taken on the first Tuesday mn nerxt sesgion. ^ The defendants were both in court, but did not surrender, and their recogni2ances being respited till next session the proceedings terminated. THIRD COURT. (Before XL PREN-DFRGAET. Bsq., Q.C.) Thomas Holland, a respectable looking young man, aid to he a teacher In a Catholic school, was indicted for feloniously assaulting Hannah Peake. Mr. Austin prosecuted, and 3M. Pollen defended. The prosecutrix, a somewhat singular looking young woman, 24 years of age, and whose intellect seemed to be impaired, said that she lived with her friends at North Hyde, near Isleworth, and that upon the evening of the 22d of August the prisoner, whom she had once or twioe spoken to, came up, and having shaken bands with her at the pte forced her along the passage into the back kitchen, and there assaulted her In a very grosu manner. Sbe struggled violently, and her screams bringing her little sister into the kitchen, the prisoner got up and ran away. The CoOminoEB at great length interrogated the witness to acertain whether she had in any way been a conscnting paty to any freedom that might have led a lad like the prisoner to imagine that further liberties would not be resisted, but she denied that she had. Mr. RIBToN briefly cross-examined the witness to the same effect, but she strongly denied having given the prisoner any cause for his conduct towards her. Two children, the sister and cousin of the prosecutrix, proved coming into the kitchen and seeing the assault committed, and prisoner offered them a sovereign not to say anything about it. r. Rio havir g briefly addressed the jtury, T he COSrnSIOyxs summed up, commenting upon the evidence, While the jury were deliberating the Cox3issrom interposed several times, and pointed out different points in the case, commenting further upon them. Mxr. RinToN, with much warmth, protested against such a course being pursued when a case was olosed. The case, during the early part, had been nearly taken out of his hands by the Bench, and from the tone in which the Commissioner had made remarks upon what he had elicited trom the prosecutrix. he thought the Commissioner enttrtained an opinion that there was scarcely any case, and had therefore said but little to the jury, and now he ound the jury in their deliberations interfered wth by emarks from the Bench adverse to the priEoner. The Coss?.usssouxt denied that he had taken the case out of the counsel's hands, or that he had interfered in the matter inanywayto call for the remarks which had been made upon his conduct. Mr. RIBTo- repeatel his objection to the coure which hadbeen rsued by the Commissioner throughout the After some further remarlks from the Bench, which provoked immediate replies from the counsel, the scene, happily for the dignity of justice, was brought to a close. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to one month's imprisonment. HeMy Webb, 43, hairdresser, was indicted for a burglary in the dwelling-house of William Henry Hammond and stealing property to the value of 701.; another count in the indictment charged him with receiving the property knowing it to have been stolen. Mr. Orridge prosecuted, and Mr. Phillips and Mr. Sleigh defended. The facts of the case have appeased in the police reports within the last few days. The jury found the prisoner Guilty of receiving, and he was sentenced to four years! penal servitude.

TA OK STBELE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME. Sir,-I w-s conversing ono evening, shortly after the terminatlon ol the RBueian war, with a young friend of mine Who hd served throughout that fearful struggle, had managed to survive disase, tho Russian fire, and the winter hardships of 1854-, and had returned home to tel us by our fireside of his sufferings and escapes, which he did very modestly and truthfUlly. Our eonvorsation at last turned upon promotion from the ranks. My friend was dead against it. He accused me of being desirous of offioering our army with "blackguards," and assured me that the existing class of officers would never stand such an Innovation, but would cut the concorn altogether if it were adopted. He added that the men themselves did not wish fox it, preferring much to be led by gentlemen. He clinched his arguments by declaring thAt the sergeant of his company, a married man of 35, had actually refused a commission when it was offered to him. As I had heard all this very often bpfore, I changed the subject by asking him who a eertain Jack Steele was to whom he was constantly alluding In his anecdotes of the war. Jack Steele seemed to be his beau ideal of a hero. Jack Steele was six feet high, as strong as a bull, and sa active as a cat. Jack Steele had been his hat mate and mess-mate throughout the winter, had nursed him through the cholera at Varna, and had run the gauntlet of the Russin sharpsbhooters in carrying him on his back to the rear, when my friend's thigh was broken by A grape shot in the, trenches Wbhen the accounts of his company were thrown Into confusdon by the death of one pay-sergeant ant the dishonesty of another, and perhaps a little by his own carelesoes%, Jack Steele, a capital hand at figures, had set them right in no time, At Inkermaun Jack had behaved with such conxummate gallantry and coolness that he had been publicly thanked by his colonel at the head of the regl. ment. It was quite a pleunre to be in the trenches with Jack, he was so alert and cheery; no chance of being sorprised by the Ruskies as long as Jack Steele was on the look-out, and he was always on the look-out when he was on duty. " Who is this wonderful fellowl," said I; "1 is he any relation to Colonel Steele, Lord Raglan's Military Secretary ?" " None whatever," answered my friend; and then, after a moment's hesitation, he added, " Jack Steele ain't a gentleman, you know." " Not a gentleman I Why I fancied he had bees one of your brother officers," " Well, so he is. He's the lieutenant of my company and he'a the beat and bravest officer in the army, be the other who he may. But what I mean is, that he rose from the rank, His father is a farrier at Hornmiatle. rve often seen Jack shoe our prog pony with his own hands." " But do you and the other offioers like to associate with a person of that class?" " I should rather think we did. Jackl's the most popular feUow in the regiment. He's so cheery, so brave, and so good-humoured; so ready to do his own daty andpverybody else. It's impossible not to like him." "And the men, wll they respect and follow him?" "Oh, they would do anything for Jack, or go anywhere with him, for they know even better than we do what a good soldier he is " " But it was only a few minutes Ago that you were teUing me that your officers did not like asociating with or your men being led by blackguards." " I should like to hear shiybody call dear old Jaak Steele a blackgnard," eclaizmed my friend, colouring; and then, perceiving that he had contrived to entangle himself in a palpable dilemma, he added, deprecatingly, " It would not be fair, you know, to argue about promotion from the ranks from Jack Steele, for I declare I do not believe there is his equal in the whole service." I begged him to tell me a little more about his favourite's history, and he prooeeded thus:- " As I have already told you, Jack ain't a gentloman. He Is preciouy weU educated, though, all except Latin and Greek, for he was In the husiness with his father and used to keep his books for him; but he was always mad to be a soldier, and during the rows in India he determined on enlist ing, mach to the disgnst of all his family. He joined our regiment with a draught, just before AliwaL His good looks and good conduct soon brought him into notice, and he happened on one ocasion to sve our major's life in a very daring mnnner. When Colonel Stock died of cholera Major Shako got the regiment, and, wishing to do something for Jack, offeredto put himinto the orderlyroom (Jack writes a capital hand), but he begged off that, saying he had enlisted to be a soldier, and not to be a clerk, and so from one thing to another Jack, in the course of two or three years, got to be our sergeant-major. When our regiment was cut about so severely at the Alma Uoloned Shako, who has pretty good interest at home (a near relative of Dowb'& you know-Scotch connexion), recommended Jack for a commission. Inkermann, the trenchwork, and the Redan made him a lieutenant, and he is our adjutant now, for none of our subalterns, exoept those away on the staff, have been six months in the service." I inquired how Jack Steele managed to meet the expenses of his new socal position. " Why, the EHorse Guards stand a pretty fair outfit, you know, and the old farrier behaved very handsomely. When he heard of Jack's good lack he forgave him, and offered to advanco him a couple of handred pounds; but somehow Jack oontrived to do zithout the money. You see, not being a regular gentleman, he ain't accustomed to spend money as we are. He has never been nsed to servants and horses and dogs aud betting and a hundred other things that run away with a felow's money. Then, he never wants to go on leave, he thinks of nothing bat the regiment; upon my word, I believe he enjoys doing duty. He had a chance to come home to the depOt in 1855 when he got his lientenancy, but he actually asked to be Allowed to remain, saying he liked soldiering in earnest better than making plonghboya into soldiers at home." " Jack Steele wiU be a Field Marshal some day if a Russian bullet don't stop his promotion," said I, amused and pleased at my young friend's affectionate zeal on behalf of his comrade. "N Not a bit of it. Jack has already got pretty nearly to the end of his tether. He has no interest, nor has he any money to purchase himself on with. Peace is now proclaimed, and Jack wil jog on slowly, seeing fellows with money hop over his head every day, untU he gets his company by a death vacancy. Long before he gets to the head of the captains he wil have served his 20 years, when he wiU retire on faU pay, perhaps, with the rank of major. And not a bad provision that, let me tell yon, for an old farrier's son." And so our conversation about Jack Steele ended. I believe it will be useful to place It before the public, just now intent on military reform, for the following, reasons- The country is in want of soldiers. We are reluctant to have recourse again to foreign legions, it being doubtful whether It would be prudent to introduce a body of European mercenaries into Indla in Its present condition. We want British soldiers and we want the best men that can be got Jack Steele Is the type of a numerous clams which rarely comes within the recrniting sergeant's net. He is a well. educated, well-conducted youth of the middle class, possessing that happy combination of physical and mental qualities which enterjnto the composition of a good soldier. The class to which Jack belongs rarely enter the army. They command our merchantmen, they make our railways, they constract our engines, they emigrate to all colonies and countries where pluck, conduct, and ability can push their fortunes, but they don'" enlist. And the reason that they don't enist Is, that in the British army no fair and open career is conceded to pluck, conduct, and ability without money, while if the latter qualification be posa cessed a very small modlcum of the three former will suffice to tide a man up to the highest grades of the service. The injustice which this system inflicts on the middle and the best of the lower classes by excluding them from the military service of this country I think little of, as far as they are concerned, but I think a great deal of it as far As the public good is concerned, for we are thereby de. prived of all the mlUitary talent which thoso numerous and powerful classes contain. There are men-chiefly military men-who profess to understand the purchase system far better than any Cvilian can possibly do, who maintain that the promotion of men without money is practically accelerated by that system. A return which is to be found in the appendix to the report of the Purchase Commissioners affords a sufficient answer to these gentlemen. This return gives " the names of all the officers who, having entered the army since 1815, have risen to the rank of regimental field officers without purchasing any of their oommissions." It covers a pace of 42 years, Daring that time no poor man, unable to purchas, hu attained the rank of general, or lieutenant-general, or major-general, or ooloneL Eleven poormen, unable to pur. chase, have during the last 42 years attained the rankof lleutenant-colonel, and 28 such men have attained the rank of major. Sirely, among the hundreds of thousands of moneyless Englishraen who have during that long time worn British uniforms, there must have been many who, under a more liberal system, would have done credit to themselves and good service to thelr country in the highest grades of the profession. If we do not break through this monopoly of money, and that pretty guickly, we shall again have to call upon the scum of oontinental Europe, eked out possibly by BashiBazonks as light cavalry, to don British uniforms, and fight the battles of 30,000,000 Englishmen.

THz ATLA.Nnc STEANERs.-The new Collins steamer Adriatic, which is expected by her owners to be the fastest vessel afloat, will not leave New York on the 12th inst with the mais, as was expected, owing to the necessity of cleaning her copper, which had become fouL The Atlan. io wiU tase her place. As the Adriatic may be expeoted in the MIersey in the course of a few weeks, the following description of her, extracted from the BNew York- Tribune, will be read with interest -"The Adriatic was begun more than two yers ago, George Steers being the designer of the hull, and Hor*tio Allen the designer of the engines. The hul is built of white oak and pine, each in its appropriate p lace, and the whole is bound together by a lattice work of iron, in the manner of the best Ameriean and English steamships. She will be as strong as her consorts of the CoUimns line, and nothing better could be wlshed for. Her shape is an Improvement-she has more of the clipper bauild than any other steamer. Her lines at the bow are ooncave, allowing a much sharper cutwavter, and are much more in aocordance with the laws of hydrodynamics than the usual straight wedge form of our river and ocean steamers. From this cause, and from her size, she is [expected to prove tho fastest steamer atnoat. The machinery consists of two oscillating engines placed over the keel, one before, the other abaft the shaft. The cyUnders are inclined toward each other, making an angle of 45 degrees with the horizon. The shaft Is of two pieces; on the ends near the centre of the ship are two canks, and each piston rod is attached to the crank pin of one of the cranks. Ti e use of two crank pins leaves both shafts free to play; but to make them work together the crank pins are made longer that the usual proportion, and their ends are united by a draglink. One of the cranks is thns in advance of the other at an angle of about 18 degreos, and the draglink being exactly over the keel, one cylinder is about one foot on the starboard, and the other one foot on the larboard eide. This kind of machinery does away with walking beams or dde levers, connecting rods, parallel motions, &c.; it is more simple than any other, and manv engineers of standing consider It the best. The chef dimensions of the hU arxe:-Length over al, 352 feet length at the water-line, 343 feet 8 in. breadth 48 feet; depth of hold, 33 feet; burden, 6,800 tons The diameter of the cylinders is 100 inches; the stroke is 12 feet. The Adriatic wil consume 120 tons of coal in 24 hours, evaporating 71b. of water for every pound of coal burned. The pressure of steam will be 251h. to the inch. She will make 15 revolutions per minute. Thus in one hour she will consume 11,2001b. of coal, by which 78,4001b. of water will be converted into 796,160 oubit feet of steam. Cutting off after the piston has moved 4 feet, the pressure will be at the end of the first foot 251b., of the second foot 251b., of the third 2Slb., of the fourth 251b., of the fifth 201b., of the sixth 16 661b., of the seventh 14281b., of the eighth 12501b, of the ninth 11031b., of the tenth 10ib., of the eleventh 9081b., of the twelfth 8 251b. The average pressure is 16 821h., and adding the 121b. produced by the condenser, the total average pressure on the piston is 28'821b. There are eight boilers placed athwart ship, built on the pllan of Mr. Martin, Chief Engineer of the NLvy; and, like those of the other Collins steamers, they contain a number of small vertical pipes heated from the outside; but the main difference is that they are here placed in a return fLue. Thus situated, they are neitber exposed to the iatense heat of the flames just leaving the furnace, nor to the radiation of the burniog coal. The Adriatic, like the Persia, wa- to be completed in the year 1855. In their legitimate rivalry for excellenoe the Cunard and the Collins companies were to pred'uce each a specimen of naval architecture regardess of expense. Nothing was to be neglected- the most skljut enwM ers and mechanics of Euglanu and America were to do he work. The bee. patents were to be apphed - the best officers were to be put in command. National feelings were soon excited; und In January, 185, the two oommercial companies were forgotten, and the contest was looked upn on both sides of the Atlantic as a first move towards the future suremacy of thesea. Exact to a day the Persia sailed; she caaossed and recrossed the Atlantic, leaving everything behind her, while failure after failure kept the Adriatic bound to her dock. It is said that this vessel will cost her owners a milion of dollars paid down, and a million more for loss of profits during nineteen months. What she cost the oommunityby casting discredit on American builders, and damping the spirits of our enterprisinz merchants, many millions would not repay."

J,IILITA1Y AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. The depot companies of tho 5th (Fusileers), 18th (Royal Irish), 33d (Duke of Wellington'), and 94th Regiments are ordered to proceed to Coatham Garrison for the purpose of strengthening the troops attached to the Provisional battalion. Each of the depots at Cha'ham wil be formed into two companies, consisting of 10 sergeants, 4 drummers, 10 corporals, and 200 privates, with 2 captains and 4 subalterns to each, it being the intention of the authorities at tho Horse Gaards to keep a reserve at Chatham of at least 5,000 men, for the purpose of being draughted to the regiments of the line serving in the East Indies. Reinforcements, to the number of 600 non-commissioned officers and men, are to be held in readiness at the Provisional battalion, Chatham, to embark for India at the latter end of the present month. The number of men of all rauks given by the depots at Chathamn this season for augmeating the regiments in India has exceeded 5,000, and there are now upwards of 1,000 troops of the line at that garrison ready to ombark for India whenever their services may be required. First Lieutenant F. W. Thormas, of the Plymouth divi. sion of Royal MaIine Light Infantry, has been promoted to be Adjutant, and appointed to the Chatham division, vice Lieutenant J. H. Parry, promoted to be Captain. Captain J. Vize O'Donnell, 27th Enniskillers, has been appointed to the command of the depot companies of that regiment at Chatham. On Wednesday the newly formed second battalion of the 2d Qaeen's Royals, in strength about 300 men and non-commissioned officers, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Bruce, left Colehester camp for Shornoliffe, where the staff wiU be completed, and the training of the men, who are all recruits, will be proceeded with. The first battalion remains in the camp. The enlistment of recruits continues as actively as ever, and as a proof of readiness to enter the army it may be mentioned that nearly 500 recruits have joined the camp within a very short period, chiefly for the above battalion and for the depots of the rifle regiments, which are now rapilly filling up. The agrieultural districts have contribated but a small proportion to the number of recruits, who arechiefly enlisted in the manufacturing towns. On Wednesday 10 offcers and 259 rank and file of the 30th Regiment, which bad arrived from Toenp]emore, proceeded from the Drogheda railway terminus for Belfast. Sixteen officers aind 1GG inon-commissioned officers and mnen of the Sth Hlassars arrived in Dublin by the 10 a.m. train from Newry for Nowbridge. The inhabitants of Woolwich yesterday evening wiltnessed the passage of a line of vans heavily laden with timber, and drawn by one of Boydel's traction engines and endless railway. The engine is one which has been purchased by Government for use in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and made the whole journey from Thetford in Norfolk, drawing a load of timber on four trucks, the foremost of which contained 11 tons l0ewt.; the 2d, 10 tons 10 cwt.; the 3d, 9 tons 10 cat. ; and the 4th, 7 tons 10 owt., together with a van laden with coals, water, &n., the whole load, inclading the engine, whieh weighs about 15 tons, being 57tons. The " pattens," or endless railway, enabled the engine to travel over the uneven and long line of eountry roads, some of which were scarcely passable on account of the late heavy rains, at the average rate of about four miles an hour, and on entering Woolwich the speed was far greater. On arriving at the dockyard gate the control of the engine was remarkable, being with its complete load conveyed with much facility into the interior of the dockyard, where the timber is to be stored for shipbuilding. Her Majesty's steamtransport Rhadamanthus, Master. Commander Brown, arrived at Woolwich yesterday (Thursday) morning, having landed her late cargo of steam gear and boilers at Devonport. The screw steam t:aansport Balaklava, in the service of the Military Store Department at Woolwieh, is receiving 1,500,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, and 500 tons of military stores, and will shortly sail thence for Queenstown. The embarostion of Artillery from Woolwich for Cal. eutta on board the steam transport Hydaspes has been again deferred. An order was yesterday given for the embarcation this msorning (Friday) at 10 am. The Admiralty yacht Osborne, having on board Sir Charles Wood, First Lord of the Admiralty, Captain Milne, R.N., arrived in the Mersey on Wednesday evening, re celving a salutefromHer Majesty's ship Hastings, 60, guard. ship at that port. Yesterday morning Sir Charles Wood, accompanied by Captaic Milne, Commodore Eden, of the Coastguard service, and Captain Bevis, R.N., Admiralty agent at Liverpool, proceeded in the Cunard steam tender SateUito to the Royal nail steamship Arabia, lying in tho Sloyne, ready to sail for New York on Saturday next. Salutes were fired by the Arabia and the Hastings. Soon after 9 o'clock the visitors proceeded to the Cheshire side of the river, and made a full and careful inspection of the new shipbuilding yards, slips, and works of Mr. John L.ird and also those of the Messrs. Clayton and M'Xeve. sigan and Co. In the first-named shipbuilding yard they inspected the screw steamer Vigo, l,S00 tons; Bahiana, 1,600; and the French screw steamer Arago, 2,000 tons. Several other large vessels were in process of bnUding. All of them were decorated with flags, and the French steamer had the English fllg at her main. The visitors returned on board the Satellite and steamed down the river to the Iluskisson dock, being thus f urnished with an opportunity of seeir.g the new landing stage-i 000 feot long, which has beon construc-ted by ^he corporahion for the an. commodation of sea-going steamers from designs of Sir William Cubitt,-tho range of docks and the general facilities of the port. They landed at the Huskisson Dock, and inspected the new bat. tery, the fine eogino-works belonging to Messrs. Cunard and Co., and the new dock works north of the Huskisson dock belonging to the same company. At this point the party was joined by Afr. Charles Turner, ehairmsan of the Dock Committee, Mr. Hartley, engineer, and Mr. S. Greaves, chairman of the Shipowners' Association. In returning Sir Charles inspected the now landing stage, and was also furnished with a further oppor. tunity of inspee-ing the Cheshire side of the river, of seeing the docks already constructed there, with the now dock. works, and of having explained to him the main features of the proposed great scheme for dock extension and its connexion with the railway system. Tho Lords of the Admi. ralty remained on boatd the Osborne in the river during the night, and this morning they were to leave for London by train, the yacht proceeding to Portsmouth.
COU r OF COMMfON COUNCIL. Yesterday a special Court (the first since the vacation) was held for the purpose of considering the provisions ot the Thamnes Co>nservancy Act, which received the Royal assent on the 17th lilt. There was a large attendanee of nmembers of both Courts. FUN'i FOR TIIE RELIEF OF TIHE SUFFERERS nlY THE MUTINIES SN INDIA. Mfr. R.

THE MILrITi. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is very discouraging to think that when the services of the Militi are aeain required so many of the foreign rr;iuents should be left out of the list of those selected to be enbu dled. The 3d Royal Middlesex have always been foremost in offcrirg their services In time of need. Besides furnishing a great many volunteers to the Line at the brealdng out of the Russian war, the regiuent did duty for several months at Plymouth, end finally served part of the years 1855 and lKiG :n the Ionian Islands. The officers are all young, active. and well up to their work, and ready to be embodied to g.. wherever they may be serit. I trust, Sir, with such claiusz il is nnt intenaded to leave the regiment unnoticed. 1 have the hbjiour to remain. Sir, Your very ohrdinrt servant. V-UE OF TIHE CORPS, I
IR1BELAND. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDZMT.) DUBLIN, THURSDAY M:OR-eiG STATB OF BELFAST. At the present rate of proceeding the Government Commission of Inquiry is not likely to terminate its labours on this side of Christmas. As already mentioned, there are about 150 witnesse8 at both sides to be examined, and two days have been already devoted to the evidence given by Mr. Tracy, the atipendiary magistrate, and Mr. Lindsay, the chief constable of police, whose direct examination was not concluded when the despatches were forwarded last night to Dublin. The Belfast Mercury gives the annexed sketchi of the state of Belfast on Tuesday:- ' IIt may be said that the disgraceful scenes which have gained for Belfast such unenviable notoriety have been brought to a close. Last night, up till a late hour, there was no appearance of disturbance; no persons were assaulted, and the police patrols reported all as quiet in the different districts at their bead-quarters. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise with 350 mea under arms and a reserve force of upwards of 200 men ready to be called out on an emergency. Besides these fine fellows a fresh accession was made to the military force of Belfast yesterday by the arrival, from Newbndge, of a detachEment of the 3d Light Dragoons, consisting of three offlicers and 45 men. They were billetted through the town, and can be available on a moment's notice. From inquiries we have made we do not hear of any fresh oUtrages having been- committed in town on Maonday night; shots were fired in various quarters of the town, and some personal conflicts took place, but that was nearly alL Last night shots were also fired, but not so freely as before; and there is no reason to doubt that peace has been at last established. This is in great part owing to the precautions taken by the Government, which seems to have at last resolved upon a vigorous course of action. It is now known in every house almuost in town that we are virtually in a state of siege, and that further outrages would be attended with much more serious consequences than the cowardly rioters choose to risk. Not, Indeed, but extet,sive preparations have been made orn both sides. It is a matter of certainty that the fellows, not content with guns and pistols, have aotually procured smal pieces of ordnance, with which to batter down their opponents' houses, and there cannot be a second opinion that the deadly weapons would have been freely used. Two of these (we believe, ship's guns) are in the possession of the ' Pound men,'and oneis known to bein charge of theirenemiea, the Sandy-row rioters. Thislatterinstrament the supporters of 'theconstitntion' have called bythehistorio rame of Derry'sfamous long l8pounder 'BoaringMeg;' bntthegallantApprentice Boys willnotfeelflatteredbythiscompliment, paid, as it is, by men who violate the constitation which their forefathers aided in obtaining by the thunders of their favourite 'Meg.' What steps will be takento enforce his Excellency's Order in CounciU remains to be seen, but all must desire the most vigorous precautions to be taken to enforce peace in the disturbed districts, the inhabitants of which shouald be made to feel the full effects of their misconduct." THE HARVEST IN ULJSTER. The following is extracted f:om the monthly report of the Derry Joxrrta, an old and careful authority upon sa questions bearing upon agricultural affairs "Coming to the question of produce we are still in.:lined to the opinion that oats, the staple grain crop of Ulster, will yield over on average, whilo the bulk in the staslkyards IS very much under that of most years; the deficiency being in straw alone, which vill be both scarce and dear. The samnle of oats is excellent, and the yield with the niller good. We have heard of large returns per acre in oats, and have no doubt the acreage preduce will be at least equal to that of any year sincea LSL A favourable opinion was entertained throughout the entire season of the wheat crop, and the samples generally in market are much finer than we have been accustomed to see from the counties of Derry and Donegal, the season being warmer, earlier, and more sunny. The grain has weight and strength, an unusual circumstance in the clay-state districts of the North-west; 541b. to the bushel is no uncom mon thing forwheat InaDerry market this year, while in ordinary seasons the weight rarely exceeds 601b. We do not think that the quantity wil be so much in excess as the quality; an average produce would probably be nearest the truth as regardsour wheat crop. With respect to potatoes there is, unquestionably, less disease than In any year since it commenced in 1846 ; we speak, of course, of the north-western counties, but the entire bulk of the crop wil be below that of some seasons; from the absence of dainaged roots, however, theproportionforhuman food wiU be greater than usual and considerable quantities will be available for exportation. The harvest has been cut down and seoured without much inconvenience from a short supply of hands. Wages have been high, although not high in proportion to the remunerating prices the farmer now commands for his produce." THE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

ARTILLERY EXAMIN4ATIONS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A rumour has reached me that tho present system of competing examination for admission to the practical class at Woolwich is to be immediately discontinued. The eountry will have no cause for complaint if the present excelenct system of admission to the Artillery is ultimately merged in a wider and better system of military competition, but those who have sOns and pupils under preparation for sn expected examination at Wfoolwjch vriU have great reason to complain if due notice of a change he not givn to them. The arrangements for the education of these candidates have frequently involved no little trouble, and a great injustice would be committed if the system were altered before next year but one. I enclose my card, and request the insertion of this letter, in the hope that it may elicit exact infornation on a subject of considerable muoment to parents and schoolmasters. Your obedientsArvant.

TIIE MURDER AT NVENLOCK.-.William Daves charged with the murder of an old woman named Ann Morgan under circurnstances already mentioned in The Tim(s, underwent an exanmination before the magistrates at Wenlock yesterday. Witnesses deposed to having heard quarrelling between the prisoner and tho deceased. Ann Itowlands stated that on going into the house on Saturday her little boy told her that Billy (meaning the prisoner) had murdered her aunt, the deceased. The deceased was found quite dead and her face covered with blood. John low. lands, the boy in question, stated that he heard the prisoner and the deceased quarrelling, and saw the prisoner go out of the house with his smock, face, and hands covered with blood. EUen Frampton stated that she found a large pocket knife on the dresser in the kitchen; the blade was open and smieared with blood. On the Friday the prisoner had shown the knife to witnc-3 and Mr. and Mrs. Rowlands. Mr. W. P. Brookes, surgeon, said that when he was caUed in, about a quarter past 6, he found the body of deceased warm. lie fonnd several wounds about the face and neck, and also a wounid on the left wrist above the thumb, about half an inch in length. The place was covered with blood, Witness and Mr. JTames made a post mortem, on the Monday, which satisfied them that death had been caused by the wounds described, which might have been caused by the knife produced. Alfred Shuker, waggoner, said that on the afternoon of Saturday, about 2 o'clock, he asked the prisoner wvberc he had been working since he last saw hiim, and tbo prisoner replied, " At home, at the top of the hill." WVitness rejoined, " You have no horne as I know of ;" to which the prisoner replied, he had a. very good one, and added thAt when the old woman (meaning the deceased) died he should have fromi 6001. to 7001. After some other evidence the prisoner was comin itted for trial on the charge of wilful rourdt r. Since his apprehension the prisoner has attempted suicide, bht was prevented froma carrying his intention into effect. THE LATE MURDER IN LEIGH WOODS, INEAR BRISTOL.-The clue which was supposed to have been discovered yesterday to the identity of the murdered woman turns out to be of no avail for that purpose. The headdress in which the card referred to in The Times of yesterday was found proves not to have belonged to the deceased, but to a neice of esorge Davis, the man whose name appeared on the card, and who was apprehended in consequence. This young wooman, it seems, was among thecrowd who viewed the body on 8unday, and while she was there sbe lost her headdress It became much trampled about and was founsd among the hhir out from the deceased before the post morstem examtlination was iu,ade, and being so discovered was thought to hve bchmnged to the deceased. These facts being satisfactorily proved, Davis was of course liberated; and the idea that the deceased had been so far identified as to render it al,no-t certaini that she belonged to Bristol is abandoned. An examinaDtion of the stays worn by the deceased has shbwn that they bear the trade mnark "R," and that they have only been recently purchased. Inquiries instituted anuong all the stay manufacturers of Bristol have shown that n"ne of therit use these initials in marking their go(ods, so that the police are of opinion that the woman does not belong to Bris-ol or the neighbourhood. Informationof the snueder bas been forwarded to the Home-office, and it ii expected that a reward will be offered for the apprehension of the murderer, ard that the police will be assisted and guided by the exoerience and intelligence of a metropolitan detective of'icer in endeavouring to trace the perpetrator of this mysterious imurder. A minute description of the dress and appearance of the murdezed woman has been extensively circulated. A NEw FOOD FOR BEES.-TWvo ags-icilturists of ihe Department of the Var observed one day. in the month of Mfay last, that all their bees had left their hives, although the latter were well tilled and exceedingly heavy. T,,wards evening the fugitives returned heavilyladen, but on the f,)llowing morning set out again in a direction which was this timDe carefully noted by the farmers who had been watching their doings. They iuiEediately followed them, and soon arrived at a farm where cakes of tilseed, which had been previously subjected to the oil press, were being beaten up into a paste with water, to be used as manure for potatoes.

THE NORWYICH MUSICAL FESTIVAL. (FROm OUR OWN' BZPOPRm. NORWICE, SiPr. 17'. The second concert, lat night, drew even a larger audiernce to St. Andrew'e-hall than the firt, and the performances went off with a spirit almost without precedent even in the provinces. To witness such un-f feigned and heartil.-expressed enthusiasm would have warmed up the heart of the most wearied metropolitan, to whom after the London season a concert is only tolerable in the open air, and a pine-clad hill yields a larger amount of mental and physical gratification than the most brilliant " cavatina" from the throat of the most gifted " prima donna" that ever came out of the south to dissipatet!se spleen of moody and phlegmatic northmen. The emotion betrayed by the Norwich people was, indeed, infectious. The most determined grumbler could hardly bave failed to share it, or the most melancholy cynic to be roused for the moment from his apathy, and partake instead of sneering at the general enjoyment. Under theAe circumstances it may be readily imagined how a concert consisting for the greater part of music entirely within the limits of ordinary apprehension, executed by Italian and English vocalists of renown, all in their happiest vein and singing their very best, world bo appreciated. The applause was in " torrents," the encores by the dozen. Mademoiselle Picoolomini, who strove her utmost to leave a good impression on the inhabitants bad a lion's share of them. The duet from the conversion scene of the Marftirl, with Signor Ginglini, the duet between Adina and Dolcamara (" Quanto amore") with Signor Belletti, and the drinking duet with chorus from La Traviata ("Libiamo") with Signor Ginglini, were all repeated by unanimous desire. The greatest sensation was created by the admirable comic scene from L'Rlisir o?Amore, in which Mademoiaelle Riccolomini triumphantly proved that the car of Thespis was not the only arena for the exhibition of histrionic talent. The audience laughed with her just as much as they applauded her, and the irresistible animal spirits of the little comedian influenced the whole assembly to such a degree that the exhibition of hilarity was fairly divided between the area and the platform. At Norwich-as at Bradferd, last yearMademoiselle Piccolomini, who at first, with a pretty air of timidity, seemed to solicit the pity and indulgence of her new ludges, retired with the evideut conviction of having utterly subdued them. She was admirably supported in her first and last duets by Signor Ginglini and in thesecond (from VElisir) by Signor Belletti, whose subsequent performance in Rossini's sparkitng tarantella, "Gi ila lana,"redolent of genuine Neapolitan humour, and as voluble an Tamburini's in his prime, establisbed him as one of the heroes of the night. The pianoforte accompaniment to this was executed with admirable skill by Mr. Benedict, vwho, rejecting the book in order to follow with greater facility the rapid enunciation of his companion, played it from memory. The tarantela was encored with acclamatlons. More welcome than even this was the splendid air of the Count from Mozart's Figsaro, " Vedrb, mentr'io sospiro," which Signor BeUletti sang in a highly artistic manner, and with a thorough comprehension of the author. The three representatives of Mer Majesty's Thea're, besides what bas been mentioned, did further good service for the entertainment of their admirers, joining with more or less effect in various concerted pieces. The eternal quartet from Rigotcteo, in which that practised mnusician and general favonrite, hIrs. Lockey, sang the music of Magdalene, the never-absent trio for ladies' voices from Cimarosa's Mats-menono Seg7reta, where fMademoiselle Plocolomini was seconded with ability by the same artist and Isladarne Weiss. and the not less familiar duet from I Puritans, " Ah mio Arturo," in which Signor Giuglini enjoyed the powerful co operation of Madame Novello, were among those nieces which afforded unmixed pleasure, although, happily, their length exempted them from being rf demanded by the audience, so hungry for sweet sounds that it seemed almost impossible to afflictthem withsatiety. l here were other encores, however, and among those which b.st deserved the honour was the beautiful serenade from Fra Diavoto, which Signor Gardoni sang with exqrsisite and truly musical expression. PearEali's madrigal, " 0 wiU o'er the downs so free" (vvhich, by the way, is getting terribly hackneyed), extorteda similar distinction in favour of the chorus, who, nevertheless, were hardly up to the standard expected of them; while, in Cursehmann's Sraceful, but threadbare trio, " Ti prego o Madre mia," Miadame Weiss, Ars. Lockey, and Signor Gardoni were persuaded to swell the list of these terrible infLietions. Madame ANovello's "Dove sono," perfect in all respects, contrasted agreeably with the light materal of which the greater part of the concert was made up. Mozart is welcome, no matter in what company, more especially when represented by melody so speaking and divine, and through the medium of sueh a voice as that of our accomplished Etnglish soprano, who could teach half Italy to sing- good music. From the rest of the vocal pro. gramme we can only single out a very clever song entitled "' The Reeall," the composition of Miss Macirene (R. A.. hL), and the great and arduous scene of Leonora, from the first act of Fidelio, which the new singer, Mademoiselle Leonhardi, gave in the original language, and which is as much .beyond her means as the air of Elvira mentioned yesterday. Mademoiselle Leonhardi, at any rate, possesses ambition (looklng at her choice of Eongs); and who knows but that this may lead to greater tbings than her presenit accomplishmeents warrant us in predicting ? To the abstract lover of musie, for Itself, the performances of the magnificent band wvhich Mr. Benedict directs with so much talent must have been a godsend amid this interminable medley of operatiefragments. Thebdlliant overture to Fra Diavolo, at the commencement of the second part, contrasted curiously with Spohr's symphony of 27te Seesons, which inaugurated the first. In the former the lively Frenchman appears in his most genial, in the latter the thoughtful German in his least spontaneous mood. The one is all spontaneity, the other all, or nearly all, labour. smelling strongly of the lamp. The Seasons was described on its production, seven yesrs since, at the N4ational Concerts, and a renewed acquaintance does not induce us to reverse the indifferently fevourable opinion then expressed. Clever and ingenious it is, undoubtedly, and instrumented with wonderful skill, but, except the second movement (Spring), a msederato in G major, we find little of that genuine inspiration by which many of the earlier works of the master are distingished; and even here reminiscences of the Wich der Tone and the symphony for two orchestras (Eartidiness and Godliness) oecasionallys pring up to rob the impression of its freshness. The Seans is what Herr Wagner and M. Oclibicheff (the opposite extremes of opinion, agreeing in no other definition) term " programme mesic ;" and subjoined is a programme which should help the listener to understand it: This symphony deautbess the chauge or ths seasons, and the trausittons tr,at one to another. The finst moenemnut (' allegro mae6tn,") repreienta Winter, and depicts altemately the so-erity or the c3d sesson ani the pleasares and comforts ot the winter fireside, The aw.kentng of nature, tbe transition to Sprinz (" moder.to", themost beautilt o seasons o s iasdribed In the scher7o. The seoond jnrt (l adag7o"1 desribes the oppressive heat of summer ; and the a6t movement (" aDlegro vivao,"). Autumn. with the psseasnra of the cbase. aed the datheriug of the graps, for which purpose is interwoven with It tee melndy of the 'I heinwein Song,"' Whether Beethoven, in the Pastoral Sympony, chalked out the linmits beyond which the so-caUed descriptive music should not go is a question for those who eontemplate music esthetically to decide. The countless failures that have followed in the wake of that prodigious work of genius would seem to argue in the affirmative, however Mendelssohn's Hcbrides and Meerstille (not to mention his Walpurgis-nocbt, where, after the storm and theapproach of spring, a chorus and solo voices are employed-thus bringing in worde to aid the description) may be advanced in favour of a contrary decision. At al event The Scoeens of Dr. Spohr fails from the point of view suggested, while it does not add to his high reputation as a composer of abstract music. The execution last night of this extremelydifficultcompositionwhich modulatesito almost everykeyin the accustomedchromaticmanner of Its author-wassuperb, and afforded it every chance of scess. It did not, however, make a strong Impression. although atteutively listened to throughout. The Fra Diuvolo overture was quito another affair; it ass performed with extraordinary animation, and appluded enthusiastically. The splendid march from Meyerbeer's Camp of Silesic (the themes of which were afterwards employed in L'RtoiZe du Nord) terminated the concert with the utmost spirit; and never did a crowded audience disperse with a more vivid sense of having experienced a genuine gratification. The performances to-day, Beethoven's Mfount of Olives and Haydn's Seasons (anunreasonably lengthv progrmmme), concluded at so late an hour that we must be content to record the fact of their having taken place in presonce of the largest andience yet assembled, and to the uanimous satisfaction of all present. There were happily no encores, or the concert would not have been over until dinner-time -a not very agreeable reflection for those who have to reappear, either as performers in the orchestra or as auditors in the area, at 8 o clock. The following is a statement of the numbers that have attended the concerts, morning and evening, up to the preseuttime e s Patrons' Reserved Orchestra, Gallery. Seata. Galler7.

TEWTIMONIAL TO DR. LIVINGSTON. GLASGOW, WEnmspiy. In terms of the unanimouu resolution of the Town Council, passed a few months ago, the freedom of the City of Glesgow was this way presented to Dr. Livingston, the African traveller. The presentation took place at 1 o'clock in the City-hall, which accommodates 3,500 people, and alike from the celebrity of the traveller, ard from his being a nativo of the district, the event created an unusual degrea of excitement, and the hall was crowded in every part by ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Livingston, on making his appearance with his two boys, was received with a round of enthusiastic cheering. He was accompanieo to the platform by the Lord Proo*t, magistrates, and members of Council; by Mr. Walter Buchanan and Mr. Robert Dalglish, the members for the city; Sir Edward Colebrooke, MP. for Lanarkshire; Sir James Anderson, LF. for Stirling burgha; Sir Archibald Alison, the historian; and by many other distinguished citizens and members of the clergy of all denominatiors. ThSOLORD PROVOST on rising was received with great aPplause. When the cheering had subsided his Lordship spoke as follows :-We are met here, ladies and gentlemen, to present the freedom of the city of Glasgow to Dr. Livingston. (Applause.) Dr. Livingston, your return to this country after an absence of more than 15 years was >marked at the time by an extraordinary feeling of surprise, wonder, and gratification, not only by the learned, but by every cls who can sympathize with the long and persevering industry and sufrering you have so heroically borne while travelling through and making researches as to the present state of Southern and Central Africa. (Applause.) £hat country, so long a tarra incogrnita, his now been surveyed and mapped out by your almost individual exertions. A land hitherto hidden and unknown has been opened up and made patent to the philanthropist and the merchant. The various raoes that inhabit those immense tracts of a darkened wilderness have by you been made acquainted vith tho white man-been, by your Christian and benevolent communion, led to reciprocate kindness, and to desire to be on friendly intercourse with the other peoples of the world. (Loud cheers.) I say your return has been halled by all, and signal marks of honour have been heaped upon you in high quarters In the metropolis, as weU as in every other part of this country. But I am sure I speak the feelings of this large assembly when I say that this district and city feel a articular pride and interest in yonr great achievements (Cheem ) oro your being one of ourselves, born among us, educated at our university, wo claim you already as a citizen, and we consider your great work as the effort of one whose name will hereafter be associated with the many extraordinary men who have been benefactors to the human family and an honour to the place of tteir birth. (Cheers.) Shrming in this feeling, Sir, and in the hope that you would visit us before again leaving this country, the Corporation of Glasgow unanimously resolved by some public demonstration to express to you personally their admiration of your career, of your selt-sacrificing industry heretofore, and, as a stimnlus to your fature operations, to present you with some special mark of their approval. (Loud cheering.) There was some doubt how this could be most effectually done, but there was no difference as to its being merited in the very highest degree (Applanse.) It ultimately was resolved that the greatest honour in our power was to offer you the freedom of this ancient city, which I now do by presenting this golden box, which contains your burgess ticket. [The Lord Provost was loudly cheered on presenting the box) His Lordship proceeded.-I am sure, Sir, it is unnetessary for me, and before this enlightened and brilliant asRemblage Who are preoent to witness and approve this act of the Council,to attempt to narrate the manner of your life in the bush for the long and interesting period of your bygone travels, of your hairbreadth escapes, your Llmost superhuman perseverance, your personal sufferings in the cause of Christianity, in the extension of civilization aEnd in promoting friendly intercourse with the newly-discovered races that inhabit Central Africa, and of your devotion in again offering yourself for the further prosecution of this great and noble work. (Cbeers.) Our wish is that, with assistance from this country, you may be enabled to renew your labonrs, so as to give confidence and assurance to the chiefs and others who so kindly treated you when in need that you are the accredited agent of one of the greatest nations on the earth, and come agsan among them to redeem your foramer pledges of a renewed and enduring friendly intercourse. (Cbeers.) The great names thas have preceded you in this honour of citizenship -Lord John Russell, Lord Macaulay, Lord Palmerston, Lord Elgin, and Sir Colin Campbell-will, I hope, snfciently prove the desire we have to rank you among the foremost men of the day. It is not a little curious to mark the high and important positions alU of those illastrious individuals have been called to in the service of their country since they became citizens of Glasgow. (Loud cheers&) We bope, Sir, that the like good fortune is in store for yOU, and that your life may be long spared, and that the sphere of your unfulness may be farther extended, so that the renowrn of our city and your own fame may be increased by the labour, usefulness, and humanizing efforts of our youngest citizen. (The Lord Provost resumed his seat amid loud cheering.) Dr. LIVL'GSTON', who on risinmg was received with loud applaulse, then returned thanks, lIe said-My Lord Provost, I cannot weU express how deeply I feel the honour that has just been conferred on me. I have now received the freedom of this great commercial city, close to which I was born, and at the schools of which I was nurtured. The honour is enhanced very greatly by being conferred in the presence of such a company as I have now before me, and likewise by being conferred in presence of some of my old professors, one of whom most kindly corresponded with me aU the time (16 years) that I was in Africa. (Applause.) It is a1so conferred in presence of many who, like myself, have gone throgh a hardy training in yonth, and now occupy a positiontbatvwasnotexpectedof them. Sibiquana-forI can alwaysspeakbetterwhenI get back to Africanthemes-Sibi. qnana,achief who performed a mostiimportantpartin opening upthe new country by preceding metn the line of discovery, and conquering a large tract of territory-he conquered a people who had the curious propensity to ornament their vilages with the skuls of strangers. And had not this chief opened up the line of discovery among them it is very probable that, instead of my addressing you to-day, I should have lost my skull in those viUages. He not only opened up the path, but introduncd the language in which my father-in-law was making a translation of the Bible. The chief having done so, the people found the path comparatively Smooth It was the life-long desiro of this great chieftain to have intercourse with the white men. He went, first of all, a long way to the west and a long way to the east, and afterwards came 200 miles sonth to meet me and Mr. Osswald and our party. A fortnight after that he died, having become sick almost immediately on reaching us. 'We felt very much the position in which he had left his people, and we went and spoke kindly to them, advising therm not to separate, but to support us. They answered, "You must not have any fear that we impute to you the death of SihiquAns,; and as you had ind intentions towards the father you must entertain just the same towards his son." Now, I have somewhat the same request to make to you, Idies and gentlemen. Here are my two sons (tbe learned Dootor presented to the meeting hbi two sons, fine little fellows, and continued amid loud and warm applause)-I intend soon to return to my old sphere of labour, but I leave my sons among you, and whatever kindness you may hxve felt towards myself, I beg of you to transfer a portion of it to them. (Loud applause.) I am very much delighted to have this opportunity of speaking a little on the subjeoct of the productions of the new country. I had the honour some time ago of addressing a meeting at Manchester, and, in answer to a number of questions as to the prospects of that part of the country as exemplified in the productions that we find in abundance in it, I wil mention now a few of the products to which I did not at that meeting allude. One of the products is the wild grape vine, of which there are three varieties, none of them at all good to eat in their unoultivated state, but capable of great improvement. In Manchester I also omitted to refer to the Angora goat, which I am told (for I did not myself see it) is also found in %he country. The long silky wool of the animal gives it the appearance of walking without feet. I mentioned at the meeting I aliude to that cotton is cultivated more or lees all over the country. I believe that a Christian community is a misdonary community; and that, although we are not all required to go forth as missionaries to the heathen, yet we can influence the commerce of the world, in this greet city of merchant rinces, in such a way as to effect Christianizing results. They hsve a great deal of power, and I believe they may aid their friends across the Atlantic. The Americans are not all s1aveholders or supporters of the slave system. They are working, many of tbem, for the abolition of slavery in America; but we are greatly dependent on the slaveholders of that continentfor our sup ly of cotton-a state of things that does not commend itself to the friends of liberty m America orliberty in Great Britain. (Uear,) But wehave got into a peculiar combination of circumstances in this respect, and can hardly help ourselves In Africa, however,ve havelargecotton fields. Letmenot be understood aspropoding that large speculationsshouald be engaged in atonse, for 1 have always recommended time, and said that the progreesive developvuen,t of A\frican civilization must be a slow one. Th1e 7'imc.s lately took up this point in avery p roper way, and gave it more prominence than I could have dons, though, I thik, in every speech I have made I have maintained that time isi an essential element in the dvelopment of the resources of a new country. Wben I spoke at the Society of Arts I did not state that vessols should be sent by the Zambeoe, as they could only get a cargo of hippopotamus flesh, w;hich, though it made good pork (laughter), was not exactly what they were in search of. A single merchant of Manchester, Mr. Clegg, about 11 years ago began to distribute cotton seeds among the missionaries, and about seven years ago he began at a loss to purohase cotton. But this year he obtained about 600 bales of cotton, and next year he expects to get at least 1,000 bales. (Hear, hoar.) He sends out cotton gins to the natives, who are delighted to get them ; and if the same process be carried on by the Cotton Associa. tion8 of Glasgow and Mancbester, in the course of several years it will hai-e a material and most beneficial influence on the market, and I hope that it will releve tho American slaveholders from the necessity of having slaves. The natives ar" exceedingly anxious to engage in commeroe. The learned Doctor then proceeded to say that the xccomplishment of this desire bad boen bitherto frustrated by the intervention of various warlike tribes, who opposed by every meani their exit from the centre of the country to the sea, Some timo ago, after the path was opened, the central natives were much delighted to reach the sea, which they had been told formed the limit of the world. They said they had travelled with their father until the world said to them, " I am done; tbere is no inore of mo ; there is only sea in front." (Laughter.) Althorsgh, on retiring from that expedition from the centre to the sea, I came without any goods, the natives received me with great kindness and coartesy, for they felt that, though I brought thom nothing, yet I had conferred on them a great favour by discovering the path. As to the cotton, they pro. duoed it merely to upply their wantl, and they had a. artificlal wanta. Commerce shows to us that we aredep dent upon others; bat with tho heathens there is no guch thing. They like to be independent of everybody els, and they like to depress othes beliere that the res1icjon upon trade in our own coontry was but a remnat of heathenism, but it has now been hippily removsL (Laughter and cheerg.) I should like to stte that the Por. tugnese Government treated me with the greatest kindne%, cbl ever remember their kindnes with grCttd When I arrived among them from the oentre of Africa on, my way west, I was nearly naked, but they clothed me audIIrcivediequualkindnessontheeatdde. Thisrnightbe. In part due to some despatches which Lord Clarendon had cent, but I btlieve it was in great measure dictated by their own kindly feelings. (Cheers.) Now, everal parties have aked me to form commercial companies, hnt I have alws declined to do so. (Elear, hear.) I have al!ays saic that at present the forming of compr es would oe pre- iatuxe and that the thing must be begun in a sarll' wy. he Portugaese are on the outildrts of the country on both sides, and I think it would only end in good' feeling if we consulted with them, and invited their cooperation. (Hear, hear.) Ther can be no doubt thatthey would derive the greatest benefit by the extension of commerce with Africao but they have been for ageB on the out:kirte, and nble to develope the reeouroes d the interior. Indeed, I do not think they know them, or they v ould not be sending to Morainbxsne, £ dishace of 900 miles, for that which they could get by travelling 100 Most of the houses of the Portuguese settlers ar composed of stone and mud, and in a few Instances the verands ae supported with lime. When I came down the Zambese £ found three varieties of marble-one pink colour, another white, anrd the third a dirty shelow. Had the Portoguje e known that there was lime within 100 milea of thuem, certainly they would not have travelled 900 miles for it ; perhaps the reason for their not having made this and other discoveries was because of the tribes to which I have referred. being in the way; and, indeed, I do tot believe that the would have allowed a stranger to pass through them as I did bet for the circumstance of the chief, Sibiquana, havinx - opened up the way for me. And now that we feel a wast of cotton, and novw that a new field has been opened up, I'. look upon it a quite a Providential development, and we ought to direct our commerce so as to influenoe in its course those great evils which exist among our friends acroses the Atlantic. (Cheers.) There is no difficulty in the way of religion among the African tribes. Those of the north are more religious than those of the south, but we have no flahomedanism. I saw it stated in a news. paper that we could not have any intercourse with the pople of the eaat because of their Mahomedanism. Now it d ,es not prevail at all, and we have not a vesie. of the Christian religion at all. The only thing like a vestige-shall I say of the Christian religion ?-is the manner in which the ladies adorn their heads, so that theirhair is like the glory round the head of the VrgUi We*found a number of slaves building boats, who call themselves Mahomedans on Saturday and Christians on Sunday, so that they have two Sundays in the week. (Lughter.) This arrangement is because they want two days play. Perhaps the working men of Glasgow may Improve upon this hint. (Laughter and cbeers.) In conclusion, nowthat I *ee so great interest taken in this oountry, not only by a solitary individual in Manchester, bat by Glasgow and Manchester, these two powerful commercial cities, I have the greatest hope. (Cheers.) Still, I look up toAroidece aad pray that this great attention directed to Africa may lead to the commercial sad. spiritual elevation of countless thousands of its inhabitantg. (Cheers.) I bave again to thank you heartily for the. nonour you have done me in coming to see this presentation, and I have to thank the Lord Provost, magistrates, and towna council with all my heart for voting me this tesimonial of their appreciation. I shali always remember it with the utmogt gratitude. (The rev. gentleman sat down amid immense applause.) Mr. W. BUCHANAX, LP., said he had to request that the meeting would join with him in expressing thanks to the Lord Provost and magistrates for giving them an opportunity of hearing Dr. Livingston. (Cheers.) He was sure they agreed in the sentiments so weli expressed by the Lord Provost. It was a fitting occasion for the corporation to come forward and testify the admiration which not only they themselves, but aU the members of the community felt in reference to the exertions of Dr. Livingston in the. cause of civilization aud of Christianity. (Cheers.) The LoRD PROVOST briefly ackowledged the compliment, and the immenso assemblage separated. On the same evaening anther splendid assemblage met iun the City Hall, the Lord Provost in the chair, when Dr. Livingston was presented with a pecuniary testimonial amounting to 2,0001.-the result of a subscription raised br tho citi7.ens of Glasgow. The proceedings were of a very interesting character.
THE ATLANrIC CABLE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Observing with much regret the unfortunate resulb of the late attempt to lay the Atlanitic telegraph cable, we have been induced from that circumstance to devote our serious attention to the causes which led to the accident, with the view of devising sorne plan to prevent any future failure. Frorn the reports publisbed it appears to he beyond doubt that the cause of the parting of the cable was the enormous strain suddenly imparted to it by the rising of the vessel from the trough of the sea. Now, as this unequal and uncertain strain from the above and other causes is certain to arise, the great desideratum *ppears to be how to provide such an apparatus as shal, at all times and in all weathers, immediately and of its own accord adapt itself to whatever extra pressure the cable may at any time be subjected to;. such apparatus to be on board the discharging vessel, to be perfectly self-acting, and so simple in constraction as almostto defy the possibility of derangement. These results we humbly conceive we are able to attain bv a machine of the following description :- The brasses ef the journals of the pulley over which the cable is to pass to be movable in the frame, and a lever, with the required weight thereon, to be so placed as to act on the puUey, and when fixed at the ordinary required pressure to prevent the too rapid paying out of the cable, the pulley, with the cable thereon, will be pressed upwards against one or more revolving wheels fLxed in the upper part ot the frame; the paying out will then commence in - regular and continuous manner, but immediately any obstruction presents itself, either from the sudden rising of the vessel or from any other cause, so as to create a greater strain than the corresponding weight on the lever, that insiant, and wthout any manipulation whatever, the lever will immediately act by yielding to the obstruction, and as soon as it has pasqsed away will as instantly resume lts former position. To make the above machine more clear we have constructed a model for the purpose of showing the prineiple o its action more apparently to those whose duty it may be to secure the best meansof ttaining auccess in the undertaking. Our object has been to avoid al complicattd movementa on board the discharging vessel, and to obviate the necessity of independent auxiliaries. We beg to remrain, Sir, Your most humble and obedient servants. TWVO WORKENG MECRANICS. bept. 16.

Just previous to this she had given her baby to my wife, who had passed on with her own children to the next room and although I explained thatit Ws quite a mistke. and that we had no wish to disremard the rules of the establishment, I hoped when s~he had given up her parasol and came back again she woId be allowed to pass, as her friends hadton. on before; but to her surprise she 'WaB refused,nor wonld: the person aUlow her children to come to her Surely such nnlbecorning conduct as this ought to be put a stop to.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In Te Tm eM of yesterday there is an extract from the McIbournc Aratzs relative to a short supply of water on board the chartered ship War Spirit. Permit us to state the facts as far as they are made known to us in the letter of the surgeon of the ship and our agents in Melbourne. The former writes under date of 11th June :-" I beg to, announce our arrival at this port, after passap e of 28 days from the Cape, at which place Captain Gray intended calling, but on making the land changed his rnind and shaped a course to this port. From the Cape here the passengers have been healthy, and have not suffered at all from the half allow%ncs4 of water they have been on up to the 6th of this month. The purser informs me, it does not appear, after all, that it was necessary to Ro on half allowance of water." The latter writes on the 24th of Jnne,-" Captain Gray has been brought before the uagistrates by the im nnir tion officer, and fined 2501 for short supply of water. e Bent to us for the money to pay the fine, which we declined, because, as far as we could learn, he put the people on short allowance of water without any necessity, and through hi& own error of jum?ment. Of course, had he asked the money on account of his freight be should have had it, hut he didi not do so."
