AMERICA. [A snumn&ry of the following, received by electric tolegraph, app,saed in our second edition of yesterday:-] LIVERPOOL, JU2;E 8. The British and North Amercan Royal mail steamship Asia, Lott commander, arrived this morning from New York with advices to the 27th ult., $1,427,220 and 20,2501. in specie on freight, and 180 passengers. On the 28th ult. the Asia exchanged night signals with the Royal mail steamship Arabia, hence to New York. The new steamship Columbia, Berry commander, is intended to leavo New York with the mails for this port, on the Collins line, on the 6th inst. The North American Steamship Company's screw steamship Circassian, Powell commander, arrived at Portland on the 21st, with dates hence to the 9th ult. She made the rtn from Halifax in 32 hours. The Washington correspondent of the Neto York1 Herald telegraphs that General Cass is engaged in preparing a reply to the recent application of Lord Napier to renew negotiations in regard to the affairs of Central America. Major Benjamin M'Culloch has declined the go. vernorship of the Utah territory, and a Western man is said to have been elected for the post. Strong measures are to be adopted against the Mormons, and a large military force despatched against them. It is stated on reliable authority that they are about commencing a settlement near Council Bluf, for an outpost or receiving-station. The leading men are to be Eastern men, who have not been initiated into the real mysteries of Mormonmm, and who will therefore be better fitted for taking charge of young disciples, and giving them their first lessons in the new faith The founding of this settlement is supposed to be the cause of Brigham's secret expedition to the north. It having been announced to Lord Napier that the steamer Michigan on the Canadian Lakes was a few tons larger than the size allowed by the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, his Lordship directed the attention of Uhe United States' Government to the matter, Tind orders were given to disoontinuie the use of it. The Canadians, however, were anxious that it should continue on the station, and Mr. Brown, in the Canadian Parliament, called the attention of the Government to the question. The vessel only carried one gun, and she had been of reat uSe to the mercantile navy of the lakes, havg always been ready to go to the assistance of vessels in distress. It might be suggested to the Governmtent of the United States that they wzere not at all afraid of the vessel, and that, so far as Canada was concerned, she might remain on the station. T'he crops in Texas were likely to become a perfect failure, in consequence of the scarcity of rain. The terrible destitution and starvation of the inhabitants of the northern part of Michigan are attributedto a blunder of the Department of the Interior, combined with the lack of forethought on the part of the settlers themselves. Mr. Morse late Commissioner to Bogota, on his arrival in Washington, expressed no doubt as to the eventual settlement of the difficulty between New Granada and the United States in a manner satisfactory to both parties. Dates from Mexico to the 5th ult. report that President Comonfort had returned to the capital from Tacubaya. There was an active canvass going on among the candidates for the Presidency and seats In Congress or on the Bench of the Supreme Court. General Comorjort and Senor Lerdo Tejada were the most popuar candidates for the Executive Chair. The Archbishop was dangerously ill. Santa Anna's friends were intriguing for his restoration to power. The new Ministers to Brussels and Berlin were about to leave. The Minister to Rome left on the 6th ult. It was thought a reconciliation with the Pope would be effected. $2,000,000 in specie had been shipped from Vera Cruz for England. The reported defeat of Colonel Crabbe and his Filibustering party into Sonora is confirmed. The defeat took place near the village of Caborca. The Filibusters were aU to be shot, to the number of 65. The Filibusiters met with a series of disasters. Two of the houses in which they were besieged took fire and exploded two barrels of powder, killing and wounding a large number of them. The Sonorians suffered great loss, and Caw tain Rodriguez, of the National Guard, was killed. After the close of the first engagement the loss of officers was so great as to leave them almost without command. 500 more Filibusters are reported to have made their way into Arizona, and were encamped in the region of Tueson. Monterey papers of the 8th ult. report that the Adiniistration of Vidaurri continued popular, and the State politically at peace. The Governor had left on the 7th for the federal capital. Advics had been received vi i New Orleans from Havannah to the 15th ult. A report was current that the Spanish steamer, hourly expected, would take orders for the immediate commencement of hostilities against Mexico, to be opened by a naval attack upon Vera Cruz. The island was healthy. The sugar crop was nearly harvested. It would fall short of last year's crop about 20 per cent. Prices had an upward tendency. Stock at Eavannah and Matanzas 270,000 boxes. Freights nominal, and no prospect of improvement this season. Exchange on New York, 2i per cent. discount 60 days' sight. The slave trade was flourishing, A British ship named-most inappropriately, we should imagine-the Duchess of Sutherland, had landed 000 Africans near Sagua la Grande, and was then burned to the watar's edge. There were a dozen vessels in the port of Havannah for sale as slavers. Kansas advices to May 21 state that Secretary Stanton had issued a proclamation for the election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention on the third Monday in June ; returns from 19 out of 20 counties were in, giving 9,25t legal voters. MIany of the Republicans were said to be going over to the Free State National Democracy, and an attempt making by Northern Democrats to send Free State men of that party to the Convention. The Hon. C. Moore, formerly of New York, had been solicited to become a candidate for Congress. Dred Scott and his wife and two daughters were emancipated at St. Louis on the 26thult. The tendency in the New York money-market was towards greater ease, the supply on call and for first-class paper being in excess of the demand. Notwithstanding the heavy export of gold, the specie reserve of the banks had increased, the receipts from California and the interior and the excess of disbursements by the Sub-Treasury over its receipts having been large. The rate of interest on call loans was 6 to 7, and on firstclass paper 7 to 9 per cent. In exchange a fair business was done for the Asia. The market in S -general was not abundantly supplied with sterling and French, and bankers at the close raised their prices to 9a to 91 per cent. for the former; the rate was 9i to 9i per cent. premium on London, 5f. 181c. to 5f. 171c. France, and 36i to 36R Hamburg. The business on the stock-market generally was dull, and quotations exhibited a downward tendency. The only stocks which had materially advanced in price were California Sevens, the rise being 8 per cent. during the past week in consequence of the almost unanimous passage by the Senate of a Bill providing for the p'ayment of the State debt, and directing the question of its ratification to be submiitted to the people. The decline was confined to a few descriptions of railroad shares, but most marked in those of the New York and Erie Railroad Company. In State stocks the principal transactions have been in Missouri Sixes at 82i to 82 to 82i; Virginia Sixes at 91i to 91i to 91i; Tennessee Sixes, at 87 to 86 to 87; Indiana Fives, at 82k, and Two-and-a- Ilalves, at 531. The cotton-market continued buoyant, with a more extensive business, part in transitu. The crop accounts are generally favourable, but holders did not exhibit much desire to force sales. Mr. W. P. Wright, in his circular, confirms his remarks that the crop is later than last year by three or four weeks, and adds it is now very generally admitted to be the most unpromiising crop thus far of any in the past 10 or 12 years. The receipts of State and Western flour being barely equal to the daily requirements of the trade, prices had advanced lOc. to 20(c., with an increased business at the improvement, in part speculative. Little doing for export, prices being too high. The market closed buoyant. Canada flour, with a moderate request and reduced stock, loc. to 20c. higher for low and medium grades; best extras without change, closing at $6 60c. to $8 60c. as in quality. Southern flour in fair request, and a further advance of lOc. to 29c. had been established. The wheat sarket continued buoyant, and in some instances as)ight irnprovemnent had been established. Corn ad a4vancmd 2c., with a t9lerably brisk bUine, The pork-market was decidedly better, at an alvance of 25c. on mesa and l0c. on prime, with a fair demand at the improvement. Beef firm; lard, ic. better, and in more request; buitter selling at l9c. to 24c. for new Western, cheese dtull, at lc. to 12c. The market for all kinds of iron was very dull. and best brands Seotch pig cannot be quoted over 834, aix months, at which only smal sales are made. English bars, too, remain very quiet; 60 tons refined brought $61 50c., and 25 tons extra, $67 50c., six months. In freights the market is without important change, and the business continues extremely light in all directions. Engagements to Liverpool include cotton at 2s. 6d. to 3s. per bale, and id. per lb. ; rosin and flour, 9d. perbarrel. To London-Beef, 3s. to So. 6d., the inside rate for small tierees; rosin and turpentine, Is. 10id. To Glasgow-Rosin, Is. 6d.; and heavy goods, 17s. 6d. to 25s. NEW ORLEANS, MAY 26. Cotton.-Sales to-day 2,000 bales, at stiffer, but' not quotably higher, prices. Sales for the last: three days 6,500 bales. The receipts at this port up to the present time, as compared with those of last year, fall short 229,000 bales. Receipts at all the southern ports less than those of last year are 622,500 bales; stock, 116,000 bales. Ohio flour, $7 50c.; St. Louisu, $7 75c.; corn, 95c. to $1. Porkr firm. Other articles generally unchanged.

COWS IN HYDE PABK. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On Sunday last, after Divine service, there we' o assembled on the grasy bank on the north side of the Ser. pentine in Hyde Park many hundred well-dressed people of both sexes, walldng to and fro and sitting on chairs let to hire by permission of Sir Benjamin Hall. A large herd of heavy dairy cows were feeding cIee by; they had recently been feeding over the very bank on which the public were assembled, and had covered it, as well as the gravel walks in the vicinity, with fresh cowdung. Surely this is a filthy nuisance which ought to have been put an end to by the deputy ranger, Mr. Stephenson, as soon as It was subjected to his notice. In the Regent's Park Sir Benjamin has ejected the cows, and has actually obtained a higher rental for the pasture as feed for sheep than it produced before the change was made by him. The sward is deam, eTen, and sweet, instead of being rank, tufty, and patchy, as it is in Hyde Park, and the gravel walks are undefiled by the depoaits of hea y cattle. In a word, the Regent's Park Is kept like a prlvae gentleman's pleaure -ground, while Hyde Park looks like an overstocked cormmon field. About five acres of Hyde Park are paled off from the publio, apparently for the use of the deputy-ranger. In them Mr. Stephenson may continue to keep the five cows to which he says he Is entitled by immemorial usage. It is not too much, I think, to ask from him in return that he should do as much to keep Hyde Park clean and sweet as the Minister of Public Works does for the Regen's and Victoria Parks. If the reasonable wishes of the public continue to be diL. regarded by the deputy-ranger, and if the ranger wil not interfere, I would beg Lord Shaftesbury to allow a few of the shoe-cleaning brigade to attend in the Park on Sunday evenings, to assist in obliterating the disgusting results of cow-feeding In a pleasure park. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A TYBURNIAN.
THE TEmpo1.ARY RESiDENcE FoB GOVERNESES- This society held its annual meeting yesterday at the French Schoolroom, Newman-street, Mr. John Labouchere in the chair. The reprt stated tat the many difficulties which rhe committee hadnet with were now for the mnost part overcome; that considerable expense had been incurred in rendering the residence a clean and comfortable home for governesses- that, the funds not being suffioient, the treasurer had advace'd lOOf. without interest, out of which sum the pressing demands had been paid oÂ£ It further stated that, in addition to pro *rig to take a large establishment, the committee thought it advisable to engage professors regularly to attend and assist the Inmates to keep up their uttanments. The governesses, by payment of 12s. per week for board and lodging, rendered the institution in a great measure selfhsupporting; and the committee bad much pleasure in statmng that the residence aawa s contalnedits fuUl complement. After several speecheos ad been nade, recomUmending the societ to the sympathies of the public,; vote of' thanks to tbe channzan was carried, and the meeting 'eparated.
PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. ROUSE OF LORDS, MONDAY, JUNE 8. The LORD CHA.CELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clocr. The Earl of MALMESBURY presented a petition from proctors practising at Doctors'-commons praying for compensation under the Probate and Administration Bill. The noble earl also presented a petition infavour of the equalization of poor-rates. The Duke of CLEVELAND presented a petition from the guardians of the poor for the union of Bishop Aucklan in the county of Durham, praying for an alteration of the berhonse system. Lord AVEbLAD presented a petition from the Poor Law UJnion of Spalding, Lincolnsldre, to the same effect. Similar petitions were presented bY Lord BnouIGmm, from the Poor LawUnion of Leigh, Lancashire; and by Earl FITZw u. The Earl of DERBY presented a petition in favour of the better regulation of the sale of poisons. MINISTERS' MONEY (IRELAND) BILL. The Earl of DONO UGIEIRMOF asked the noble earl the President of the Council whether before the second reading of this Bill he would lay upon the table a statement of the receSpts and expenditure of the ih Ecclesiastical Commisziont for the past year. Earl GRANVILL,E said that he had no objection to gve their lordships all the information upon this subject which it was in his power to afford them. THE CASE OF MER. SHEDDON. Earl GREY rose to presont a petition from Mr. W. P. R. Sheddon, "omplaining, among other things, that by a decision of 'e. -urt of Session in Scotland in 1803, and of this House in 1808, obtained in his Infancy, he has been deprived of his status of a nstural-born subject of this realm, and as the legitimate child of his parents, and of the means of duly Investigating in any court of law the question of such status, and causing the same to be recognized, and praying for such relief and redress as to this Iouse may seem meet, and to move to refer the said petition to a select committee." The noble earl said that it was with no ordinary anxiety that he asked their lordishipa' attention to the petition which he was abont to present. He was persuaded that if he obtained that attention their lord. ships would be convinced that the petitioner had the strongest claim, not merely on their compassion and sympathy, but also on their sense of right and jusce. The petitioner complained that by an iniquitous fraud on the part of those relations to whose care he was intrusted as an infant on the death of his father he had been unjustly stigmatized as an alien, and as the illegitimate son of his parent, and had thereby been deprived both of his rights as a British subject, and of the inheritance to which he wag lawfully entitled. He further complained that by a cunning abuse of the technicalities of the law on the part of those by whom this wrong was perpetrated he had been shut out from ever obtaining a fair hearing of his case on its own merits. He asked their lordships to take this statement into their consideration, and, if they found it to be well founded, that they would obtain for him a fair investigation-for that was all he asked-either by their lordships or in some court of law. The statement made in the petition he was about to present to their lordships in supIort of these allegations was one of so extraordinary a nature that it might well be termed almost incredible. But nevertheless he was persuaded that if their lordships would grant an inquiry they would find that every word of that which the petitioner asserted copld be substantiated. The case afforded another example ofithat oft-repeated say. ing, Truth is stranger than fiction-" His chief difficulty in bringing this case before their lordships was the enormous complexity of the materials with which he had to deal, because the credibility of the petitioner's statement de. pended in a great degree upon the manner in which different converging lines of narrative were brought together to support his conclusion, and in which many circumstanc X apparently immaterial were, by their connexion with each other, made to form unanswerable evidence in support of the petitioner's case. It would be difficult even for the noble and learned lord on the cross-bench (Lord Lyndhurst), on whose support he greatly depended that evening, with all his marvellous power of lucid arrangement and of stating complicated details with unrivalled rerseness and clearness, to give their lordships even a faint sketch of this most intricate narrative; but for himself, with his far weaker powers, It would be madness to attempt to enter into all the circum stances of the case. He should be compelled, therefore, to pass by many important series of events, and give merely an outline of the main case, and a specimen of some of the proofs by which that case was supported. He had been most reluotant to undertake to bring this case before their lordships, not only because he felt unequal to the adequate exposition of it, but still more because he should be compelled to bring charges of the gravest description against those persons by whom Mr. Sheddon asserted that he had been wronged. The chief actor in these iniquitous transactions, as he doemed them to be, was a Mr. Patrick, a gentleman of great age, wbo had always held a high position in society, and in the honourable profession to which he belonged. It was painful to have to charge a gentleman of Mr. Patrick's age and station with such conduct as he should be obliged te impute to him ; but if he really had been guilty of such conduct, it was due not merely to the petitioner, but to the highest interests of society, tkat that conduct should be exposed. He dUd not bring this case forward without having studied itto the utmostof his power. He had devoted great labour tolt, and he had gone carefullv through the case of the petitioner and the evidence by which it was supported, and he had also read the printed answer to that case which had been put forward on the part of Mr. Patrick, and he had heard the observations which that gentlemans agent had addressed to him on the subject. le was bound to say that his conviction of the truth of those allegations wa' not less founded upon the clear evidence brought forward by the petitioner, than on what he was reluctantly compelled to call the obvious want of ingenuousness and candour displayed by Mfr. Patrick in meeting the cl1Mes made against sim, and the palpable misrepresentation an misstatements, ba he conceived them to be, which he detected in that gentleman's answer. But to proceed without further comment to the petitioner's case. The petitioner's father, MLr. William Sheddon, left Scotland, as a young man of 22 in the year 1770, to take the management of a mercantile house into which he had entered inVirginia. He carried on the business of this house prosperously for five years until the commencement of the troubles of the American Revolution, but havig espoused the Royalist cause he was, in the year 1777, compelled to fly for his life on board one of Lord Howe's frigates, and an Act was passed by the Legislture of Virginia confiscating his property and declaring him an alien enemy. In 1778 he wuent to Berauda, and there established a mercantile house under the title of William Sheddon and Co., *a first cousin of his own, Mr. Robert Sheddon, and a brother-in-law of this gentleman, being partners with him in the firm. This house was successfully carried on until the year 1783, when its affairs were brought to a close, Robert Sheddon going to London and William Sheddon to New York. Hisgoingto New York arose out of this circumstance :-By the treaty of peace with the United States it was agreed that compensation should be made to all British subjects whohad lost property by reason of their loyalty to the British Crown, and in 1787 an Act of Parlament was passed appointing a commission to arrange these compensations. Mr. Sheddon accordingly went to New York for the purpose of bringing his claim before this commission. It appeared from the correspondence that when he went his intention was to remain there a short time, but the business of arrangement and oompensation proved to be tedious and embarrassing-in point of fact, it was not settled until the year 18, after Mr. Sheddon's death. Shortly after his arrival in America the war of the French Revolution broke out, and he was largely employed by the British Government in affairs of the ogreatest importance and of the greatest delicacy. He had to purchse supplies for the British rmy and navy in the West Indies, and to make arrangements for their transmission under the neutral flag of America. Being thus detained at Aaew York, he formed a new commercial house the partners in which werehimself, Robert Sheddon (who had beenpreviously his partner in Bermuda), and Wllliam Patrick, the nephew of Robert Sheddon. Houoht to have mentioned earlier that soon after leaving ScotIand for America Mr. Sheddon had succeeded, by the death of his father, to an estate called Roughwood, in the county of Ayr. Upon succeeding to this estate he appointed as his factor 3ir. John Patrick, his brother-in-law-the hnsband of his sister, to whom he gave a power of attorney, in conjunction with two other persons, to act for him in his absence. It appears that in establishing the house at New York, of which himself Robert Sheddon, and Willisam Patrick (who was a near reiation of John Patrick), the chief object was to launch William Patrick into business. In 1785 AMi. Sheddon married inA New York a Miss Grace Bennedy, whoa died mn a very short time, leaving him one daughter only In 1790 he married again by cvil contract a lady named Anne Wilson, and by this marriage had two children-a daughter born in 1792 anda son the petitioner, Mr. P. R. Sheddon, born in 1794. The estate in Scotland had been left in the hands of John Patrick, who had three sons. The eldest of these was Robert, a doctor of medicine and a sueon in thearmy- the second, John, a mercbant trading mn New York- and tie third, William, who was admitted as a writer to the Signet in Edinburgh in 1793. This lat named person, whose conduct was implicated in this trans. action, was still alive. In 1795 Patrick sen. died, and his sontWilliam1 gt into hiis own hands the entire maanagemnent of the Scotch estates, which, indeed, he had managed for two years before. It was now necessary that he should call their lordAships' attention to the position in which, the several parties stood at this time. In 1798 Mr. Sheddon was livng at New York as a highly respected citizen with his wife, Mrs. Sheddon. Mrs. Sheddon was receivej as his wife in the best society of New York, and waa engaged with ladies of the highest character in the charitiet anu other engagements of the place. Robert Patrick, the eldest son of Patrick, sen. was serving as a surgeon in the Mediterranean, JohnPatrck was trading on his own aecount as a merehant in New York, but mainly depending on the credit of his uncle, Mr. Sheddon; and William Patrick, as he had already stated, was crrying on business in Scotiand as a,writer to the Signet, and managing r. Sheddon's estates. He had omitted to mention that beforehis father's death Willia\m Patrick wrote to John at lew York, urgin h5m to obtain a transfer of thenowversposseesed bs his father withreference tothe saetoliimself andhis brother Robert. There was some difficulty about thinats first5 hut ultimately iMr. Sbeddoa consented, ona the power required was sert. over to Scotland. It would be clearly proved that at this time the three brothers Patrick possesed very small pecniary means-John was desirous of entering into va'ous speculations with a gentleman of Greenoock, named Hfugh Craufurd, but was unable to do Bo from the want of means In 1798 Mr. Sheddon was taeen dangerously iii, and after a long and severe illness, died on the 13th of Novem. her of that year. Previously to his death he executed a deed of entail on his Scotch property, by which it was directed that the rental of the property should be allowed to aecumulate for the use of his son when he came of age. What became of that deed of entail was not accurately known. It was the belief of the petitioner that it came into the hands of Wiliam Patricke, bat he must fraynkl admit that this was merely his belief, and that there was no evidence of the fact. Still more nearly before his death -on the 7th of November-hers executed a wil by which he directed that hfis whole property in America should be taken possessonm of by his executo y of whom John Patrick, his neohe, was one. They were charged, after paling his del-bt, which were very few, to pm to his wdow an annuity of $400, and such futner sums as beight be necegaary for the support and education of his daughter. He then directed th-at subject to thene charges his property was to remain in the hands of the executor and that whel chbi aildren atained their majority it was to be divided equally among them. His sonp he directed to be sent to Scotland, and William Psatrick he appon tea hisngeadsan It was necsesary to sthate here that ehid h M. Sheddon thought fit to have another paie oetween him. self and his wife. The first marriage lne by vil oontract, performedci the pre e itnes. Tbat form of marrauge waz perfectly vai by th law of New York, and it was then, as now also,inrfctlald by the law ofSctlpand; hbt there was no ert, it as supposed by Mr. Sheddon that there mi som e ic in prvn his mari- inL Scotln.H eivdta eegitimacy of hs ehlden woul be bett taised if he was married according to the o o e i a church, and that thereby lila son's sucen to hisband's eshtes woula be made mdore safe and mwore certain. Unf ortonately, this sep, coupled with the choice Mr. Sheldon hua made ofmthePatricks asthe person atowhom the interes of his widow and cheildren shoud he committed hd pre, ely the opposite effect to that which was intntded. The titioner stated that a deep-laid conspiracy was entered into between the Patricks for the purpa oeeof fmthPose sesson of their uncle's property, and afftixig to is children the stain of foIrtimacy. The ntiure of the plot he was able to stae to teir lordahips as allegd by the petitioner. The very existence of the petitioner t ae son of Mi. Sheddon was, in the first plac, to be concealed in Scotland till William Patrick placed his brother Robert, the eldest of the Patricoks, who would have been heir at law in the evenit of 4Mr. Shedon dyidng without issue, in rsesdon of the estates. Then the petitioner and hi siser were to be sho ator be illegitimate, ean the annuity to the widow, given under the husband's will, was to be refused. John Patrick was to avail himsel of his power as an executor, and of his knowledge of his uncle6s mercantie affair to make it appear that there were not any funds in America for the payment of the annuity, and at the same time all about the Scotch estates was to be conceed from the widow, ats wel as the claims which, under the Scotch law, abeo would have to a dower from those estates. He would now show what great facilities the parties had for carrying out their plans. In the first place Mr. W. Patrick was the factor for Mr. Sheddon, and baa the complete management of the Scotch estate and posession of all the accounts relatina thereto. Singularly enough, it happened that William Patrick in Scotland was in possession not only of those accounts which would naturally come to himi as factor but of those papers which ought to have been acheck upon him andwhiSchotuld have been in the possession of Mr. Sheddon. it would be remnembered that when Mr. Sheddon first went to Scotland be had joined in the power of attorney with illiam spatrick two gentlemen named Fullarton and miaDO-n The first named never acted, but the latter did to some extento and had possession of the papers proving the payments maide on account of the estate, and alo those from Mr. Sheddon to William Patrick as factor. Mr. MAUI bpr, however, died before 1798, and by a will which, singal enough, was witten by Willism, Patrickr he made the der Pitrick his executor, and thus, through Robert Patrick, Wifllam Patrick came into posse. sion of all those important papers. anr. Shecldon had not been in Scotland for 28 years; very few persons there knew anythcingf of him, and their lordships were aware of the difficulty communication between America and Scotland at the time, especially during a period of war. Then, again, John Patrick, the brother and asociate in this conspiracy of Williu m Patrick, was the exnecutor, and in pous session of all Mr. Sheddon!s papers in America. It was tru that two other vgntlemen had bcen associated with him in that truBt~ hut it could be shown that the moment Mdr. Sheddon was dead John Patrick, without waiting for the will to be proved, without waiting for the company of the other executors, went immedisately to his uncles house, acd in the character of representative of the family ransaked al the repositories, carried off, as was beleved, many importat paper and also, as was believed, a considerable sum of money, the fact of their being coexecutors would be apdpitaed to have been no bar to these plans. The evidence to prove these facts could only be slightly alluded to, as it consisted rnainly of a most curous correspondence, wbich only came to light a fewMye ar since, and it would be impossble to do more tuha brinell allude to it. Those letters were so voluminoui,- and facts could only b-e ascertained by a careful comparison of different passages, that it would be impossible and useless to read them alL Be was therefore compelled, to statt merely what be cot- wived to be the subsance of those letters, which, if the House thought fit, could afterwards bo more closely exanined before a comhnittee. He found tho cone. Fohndenr hxere a double character-some letters being o viously ratten for the purpose of being publicly see, which were of the -fairest ciarlete -t-There were other lette, which appeared to have been wtitten for the private information of the brothers to whom they were respectively addressed. There were others of a mixed characte, which, while giving no infcormaton to strangers, were majored iorn t s whic dwern uitintelligible to those wcoapossessed the key to them. In that correspondence wereato be found instructionsthatthewidow "lmust be cut dwn" tsshe acgtua texressionxusedbyWinyrlesome. PatcShe must otw sreeventdfo eev her anutya"o usty exanst the funds intAmerica ; hints were throffecout to raise fictitious claimons ainsts the estate towexteaarm ma the minds of the othert exuthoseris, so thattheymightbed led to decline inter- feringin Scothd mater.a Tfhenr wassaid, "You must ge h io o aiytewl to bar her claimn to doer, tout th anything about the Scotch propertya"rsuc wa te construction which he (Earl Grey) hiad be cornpelled, after a careful perusal of thegmajor portio the documents, to arrive at. In the course of that correspondence Mr. W. Patrick suggested that the widow should be prevented from coming to Sootland as she might there bo exceedingly troublesome. Tehe 'sildow was prevented from receiving her annuity, and she was utterly unable to take any effective measures to assert her son's rights. She did, however, make an attempt to ahsert thoooerights,nfor pretrdmnsitteditoarespectablesol iitor in Scotland a certificate of her marriage with Mr. Sheddon on his deathbed, together with affidavits alleging the fact of a prior marriage by civil contract, and also alleging that the object of the second marriag was to render the p toof of her son's legitimnac mnore easy in Scotland. When Mr. William Patrick found cthat in spite of all his efforts to prevent the widow from bringing forward her son's claims, she was yet doing so, he proceeded to take measures on his part to eetab no the claim of his brother, Dr. Robert Patrick. With that view he took oertain proceedings called in Scotlerd servhig a parson heireof property. The natnreof thatproceeding was that the sheriff of the county held anein uest, upon which a juiy was empanelled to try the title the claimat. In cases where the opponents of a claim were represented the proceeding was fair enough, but where there was no oppo. sitior, the jury, as a matter of course, aeoepted the claimant's story as true, and thereupon served him ase heir to the estate. That sate of things, however, had been found to open the door to such great fraud that thefla had a few years sine, been altered by Par. liendet t and the old proceeding was no longer followed. Menr. Wia Patrick succeeded in serving his brother heir to the estate. Who was to a e aast him? There w rbably no man tn pcotlad wat that time aware of the existaene of the petitioner, or of any person who had ea claim to the estate, except Mr. William Patrick; and be, the confidential agent of his uncler the guardian of the son of the pe on from whom he and his familywU reeived theg reatest kindnese through their liveso and the interests of whose chlild he was boundby everyerin,cple of duty and of honour to protect, was the mau whio swore to the inquest at Ayr that MEr. Sheddon had died in America, having made a settlement of his estate in favour of certainepersns, not mentioning who those persons were though he wellaknew they weresthose whom Mrs. Sheddon at all events considered to be his lawful wife and children, and that Mr. Robert Patrick, as nephew to the wehom tne inquest was held at Ayr, and he diso tuchtly recollected that no mention was made of any child of Mr. Sheddon. But Mr. William Patrick was not only the agent of his uncle and the gnar. dian of the petitioner, but also the judicial factor appointed to manage the estate for the benefit of all concermed, and iu that capacity likewise it was his duty to take care that no njustice was done, Another circumstance showing the onj,nus with which he acted was that, when be swore tIat his uncle and benefactor had died without leaving isoae, he kcnew, wrhatever might be the case with respect to tle petitioner, that there was a daughter by a prior n arrnge, It w7as true that Mbr. Patrick, for his own pus. }oses, represented that daughter to be i3legitimate also, imPlying that his uncle, who bore a high character in New York, had lived first with one mistress and then with another; but he knew well, though he put forward that statement, that the first daughter was legitimate-that the first Ms. Sheddon, like the second, had been received universally in New York as the lawful wife of her husband -and he knew also that their infant daughter had been Iegistered in the principal church of the Protestant Episcopal communion in New York as the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sheddon. It might ba said that Mr. Patrick was bound to supportihe interestsof his brother in prefirence to those of his oousin. That was true, and if he had endea. voured by fair and legitimate means to show that the child was not entitled to the estate, bat that it belonged to hig brotber, there would not be a word to say against him. What, however, in that ease was ths line of conduct which he sbould have pursued? He ought to have writtenat once to- Mrs. Sheddon and the executors that he had interests opposed to theirs, that he oould not support the claim of tht infant to the estte, and that he felt it hia duty to assist his brother. But he prooeeded far otherwise. He no doubt declined to act a the gardian o his ne hew, but not until six months after he had served his brother as hir.at-law and, during the whole timne that he found it for his adrantags to do so, he, withoult accepting the guardianship, exercised the powers of that offlce in such a manner asto prevent any other persn from waxtching over the interest ofth child. He asIo managed to keep the child out of Scotland vhen his presence there woid Iave boen troublesome, and so dedt with the money. which byhis own showing he had received for the benefit of his cousin, as to deprive the solicitors to whom Mrm Sheddon had ap lied of the ms of supporting the suit they had raised r. Sheddon was re-married to A certain Ctptin Wilson, tho remarria taking place by the advice of her friendr, Ma the only mean. of obtaining protection in her almost destituto oondition, and as Irs. Wilson the followed up a far as she was able the claims of her son. But, what with the difficulties of communicationwith Scotland, the circumstance of her being entirely unknown while Mr. Ptrick was a man of some influenoe, and the fact that Mr. Patrick reprosented her as a woman of bad chaoter entirely unworthy of credit, the prooeedings which she took were altogether ineffectual, and ceased about the end of 1802. Afterwards, though nothing was done by tLe mnother, legal proceedings were insti. tuted by other persons. But the petitioner stated that those proceedings were not to promote his interests. They were nstituted, he stated, with the deliberatb purpose of barring his claim to the property when he came of age, and their lordships would presently see that there was good ground for that allegation. The proceedingg originated in a etter from Mr. WilliaM Patrick to the executors in New York, suggesting that somebody should brng forward a claim to tne 6late on behalf of coudn, but leading the executors to inferthatwhoeverdld so wonldincur great pecn. niaYry esponibility. Thatletter, of course, led to nothing. lr. Patrick then put forward oertain parties in Scotlan who made an apphca'ion to the Court of Session, stating that Mr. Patrck had declined to act as guardian, and that it was for the interest of the child that his rght| to the estate should be tried as soon as oble and recommending that Mr. Craufurd, a merchat, should be appointed to take charge of his affairs. Th~eresons who made the application weree entire strangers to lffr. Sheddon and his f%ther, butwere all cienh of Mr W. Patrick and under his immediate control-in fact, his mere puppets. In oonsequence of the application the Cout of Session appointed Mr. Hugh Crauford guardian, and it became his dutyto endeavour to set aside the order by which MIr. Robert Patrick was declared heir at law. Mr. Hugh Craufurd was a merchant at Greenock, and carried on specu. lations iomitly with 3r. John PAtrick inAmerica. It could be shown that during tbe whole time of these prooeedings Mr. Hugh Craufurd in greAt pecuniary difficulties and Ws constantly applying to lr. William Patrick for money, ending the suit which he brougit on behalf of the child. He thought their lordshipe would admit that such an ap. pointment as that of Mr. Hugh Craufurd to take care of tho intereb of the child was one of most damning suspicion, but the manner in which the case was conducted by Mr. Craufurd made it far stronger than the original appoint. ment. If there had been an bondjld'e intention to sup rt the real interests of the child, would not Mr. Craufurd at once have gone to the very reskctable olicitors in Edinburgh to whom the widow had sent her own me, or would he not have made some application to persons in America, in order to obtain Informatrol ? He did nothing of the kind. Instead of employing those very respetable solicitors who were at the time in possession of the widow's papers, he employed another man -a certain Mr. Miller2 a friend of Mr. Patrick-against whom there was nothing to impute, save that he hld no means of knowing anything about the subject except what Mr. Patrick thought fit to tell him. As another proof of want of good faith, when Mr. Cranfard came to draw up the case tor counsel, and to bring the subject before the courts of iaw2 he rested the sole claim of the infant upon the ecdesiastical marilage which was solemnized on Mr. Sheddon's death-bed, and said not a word about the prior marriage, although the certificate which was put in to prove the ecclesiastical marrisge was the identicaI certHicate whlch was sent over from America, having annexed to it affidavits as to the prior marriage. It could be clearly demonstrated that thecertficate uaed was the same certificate separated from the important documents to which it belonged. That was not a1L While the claim was vested upon the eoclesiastfcal marriage and not upon the prior marriage, the ostensible promoter of the interests of the child stated that marriago not accompanied by a religious oeremony was not valid by the law of New York Hs was enabled to state to their lordahips upon the highest authority that at that time, at all events, if not now, the law of New York was precsely the same as the law of Scotland-that declata tion before witnesses constituted a perfectly valid marriage that there was no registration, and that 9-10ths of the most perfect marriages in New York could be established by no other kind of evidence than Mrs Sheddon could produce in favour of her own marriage. But he who called himself the guardian of the child put gratuitously into the case the false assertion that marnage not accompanied by a religious ceremony by the law of New York was notvalid. (Hear.) Butfurther. Upon the question of domicile, itwas ofiimportance to show whetherriMr. Sheddon intended to come back to Scotland or to remain in America, and the guardian of the child said, in the case which went to counsel, that Mr. Sheddon never intended to come beck, the fact being that Mr. Patrick was in possession of many letters from Mr. Sheddon expressing his ful expectation of coming- home, ordering a pipe of Madeira for his mse, and giving directions uot to grant leases, because on his return he wished to have the power in his own hands. Counsel had no reason to doubt the case put into their hands. They had no reason to suspect entire collusion from first to last-that it was meant and wished they should fail. They could have no such suspicion. But the case did fail, and the Court of Session, by decree in 1803, affirmed the right of Mr. Robert Patrick to the estate. Bat the case did not stop there. In a letter written in December, 1803, by MIr. H. Craufurd to Mr. W. Patrick the writer, alluding to the deciion of the Court of Session, aid the decision was very strong, and not likely to be set aside - but, as he understc,od that without appeal a challenge on tiie part of Mr. W. Sheddon would be open, he thought his duty would be best discharged b appealng to the determination of the House of Lords he person who suggeted the appeal would not allow matters to rest until the child hadgrown up and could judge for himself, but advised an appeal because "he understood that without it a challenge on the part of Mr. W. Sheddon would be open." Their lordships could judge from that with what degree of good faith the appeal was prosecuted. Now, there was this remarkable circumstnce, that pending the appeal the estate was sold by Robert Patrick to Wviliam Patric (Hear, hear.) BY his own showing, William Patrick purchased it before the appeal was decided. There. fore, what did their lordships find Why, that those three brothers Patrick were all notoriouly in low pecuniary circumstances before Mr. Sheddon'sdeath-tbatin avery short time afterwards Mr. Sheddon's estate entirely disappeared, and the three Patrieks were converted into wealthy men, Mr. William Patrick being put into possession of the etateo Which a short time previously it was notorious he had no means of purchasing. (Hear, hear.) There the case ended for some years, The petitioner, Mr. Sheddon, vas sent for from Anerica. Hearrive in thiscountry in 1800, and in 1810 he entered the Royal Navy. His ship, however, was paid off in 1815, and be then wished to enter the profession of tho law, but his uncle, Wiliam Patrick-and that was a significant circum%tance when taken in connexion with others-decideaiy objected to his doing that, on the ground that it would be a dangerous thing for him to study thelaw. (A laugh.) The resultwas that he wont to India, where he entered into trade, and eventually realizing considerable property returned to this country in 1833, having previously paid two short visits to Scotland. Soon after he retutned, in 1833, he entered into negotiations with his cousin, WiUia, Patrick-, with respect to the purchase of his father's estate. Those negotiations, however, went off, but in the cowuse of them the petitioner, Mr. Sheddon, for the first time was made to entertain a suspicion of the fairness with which he had been treated. Those suspicions being once raised, he eventually obtained such information as induced him to believe that he hadbeen wronged by his cousin, and in 1847, under the advice of counsel, he commenced prooeedings for the recovery of the estate. He also entered what was called in the Law of Scotland a declarator of legitimacy, the object of which was to prove his legitimacy. At that time the petitioner h%d no suspicion of his mother's prior marriage. In answer to the first suit a preliminary defence was put in by Mr. Patrick, but before that came on to be argued some additional information was obtained *hich led to the petitioner, Mir. Sheddon, being advised to put in a supplemental summons. He received, at the same time, certain information from America, which resulted in a commission being sent out to that country, at hisinstance, to obtain evidence on the queseon of his legitim cy, and Er. Sheddon himself accompanied the commisson to Now York for the purpose of being psesent at the inquiry. Almost the frst thing they did was to examine certain papers in the poeession of a Mr. Van Hook, a lawyer in that city, and he (Earl Grey) should call their lordships attention to a zemarkable circumstance by which the whole iniquity of tVis complcax fraud was bronght out. When rocedings were instituted in Scotland MEr. William Patrick wrote to Mr. Vau Hook for all the pa his poion relting to the affairs of his brother, rut Mr. Van Hook, to his great credit, having heard something of the proceedings in Scotland, wrote in reply that it was not for the interests of justice that the papers in question should be placed in the hands of one of the pasties to the suit, and he would therefore not part with them. It was in consequence of that declration that the papers were retained by lr. Van Hook in New York, and also in consquence Of the course which Mr. Van Hook, to his infnite honour, took on that occasion, that the transactions on which the petitioner grounded his ca were brought to light. When the comrtificon arrived in New York, and proceeaed to examine the documents in thep session of Mr. Van Hook, they found a letter from dr. William Patrick in his, own handwriting, dated in April, 1800, and enclosing, in the handwriting of his clerk, copies of the eclesiastical certificate, and of the important affidavits annexed to them, mentionin the prior marriage. (Hear.) Therefore thaer lordspe had it in the handwriting of Mr. Willianm Patrick-himself, who had previously professed to the petitioner to have acted towards him with the utmost fairness and jtustice, and to have given him all the information in his power touching the matters in dispute that before oommenciag those proceedings at all be was in possession of those affidavits which anr. Va Hook, a lawyer in New York, had deemed amply sufficient to prove the prior marriage. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Commissioner Ray's evidence proved oonclusively that the connexion between Mr. and Mr Sheddon was a rml and valid marriage,which insured theiradmission to the best society in New York. Various technical proceedings which it was unnecessery for him to describe, took place in the Scotch courts, and in 1852 the Court of Sessaon was called upon to determine whether Mr. Sheddon should have the opportunity of proving ficts which, he alleged, showed that the whole of the legal proceedings were franduleat and ought to be set aide. Mr. Sheddon oontended that the decree of the Court of Session in 1803 and the judgment of theonuseofLordsinl.808affirming thatdecre, hd been fraudulently obtined, and osght to beset aside; and he alleged that the executors of his father were parties to the fraud, and that Mr. Craufurd, who had breoxht an action m his name, was really in the IntDast, of his opponents, and bad brought-the actioY, -not-st the view of establishing his (Mr. Sherdo'eh) rtht to I4.ta*te, but really in order to bar his cleim.

Ite lord ChauoeLl wa understood to obene that if Mr. Vheddon was born after marriage he would be a British subject-] His (Earl Grey's) a ment wa that the prior marriage, which constituted She ground of claim, had never been inquired into by any British court of justic; and that if siuh prior mariag were estblsed, r. Sheddon was undoubfedly legitimate and a Britis sbject Mr. Sheddon was, however, debarred from bringingthe question before any couitof juaoeintaseo tOm He(Earl Grey) maintained that the lgegs cof r Shedon had ben fully established The subject had been bDought before an Americancou. Sinoe the appeal to their lordshipe' House Mr Sheddon had discoverd that there was certain landed propertyinthe atao of New Yo: which had belonged to h2s father, which had subsequinly been occupied by one of the Patrics, but the greatr portion of which had eventuslly fallen into the hand Of satter, who had gained a legal right to it by more than 20 years' possesion. There was, however, one of the sMuItXer who had not held his-portion of the estae for so long a period as 20 years. Against him Mr. Sheddon brought an action, whi was substantially contested. On the trial of that action witnesees were called who were well known to the present and the late Americn Ministers as pesonm of unewepionable character, snd they ono anu all declaed that Mr. and Mrs. Sheddon were man and wife,and had always been considered to be so. That verdict was considered to be so irresistible that the jury, without hesitation, returned a verdict for Mr. Sheddon, and in that verdict the judge expressed his unqualified concurrecce. Tlwo of the persons who were examined stated that nothing was ever said against the character of Mr. Sheddon, and that if she had been only Mr. Sheddon's mistreas it mut have been known all over the town, ana mr. Sheddon would have been scouted b every man in the city. New York was at tuat time but a comparativey smal town. The zmanners of its inhabitants were chaacterized by some. thing of puritanical sSrictne4s, and it was inconoeivable thast, If noturried, Mr.andXmrs,Sheddonshould have beern admitted into the beet society, and that her nme should, among the lies, have been quoted as that of a person whose assistance might always be depended upon in all cases of charity. It ws not too much to assert that if thi evidence did not prove the legitimacy of Mr. Sheddoa, he lknew not what evidencoe could be sufficient to prove the legitimacy of any one of their lordshipe. (Hear, hear.) Under these circumstances he asked, was not Mr. Shedden entitled to claim, not from their compassion, but from thdr sens" of justice, relief at least from the hardship of being branded as illegitimate and being deprived of his siags a , British subject ? Was it unnatural that the descendant of an ancient Royalist of the American war should attach value to the character of a nturial born English subject? Was it unnatural that the bearer of an honourable name descended from a long line of ancetors should be ansiois to prove that he was legitimately entitled to bear that name ? Above al, WAS it unnatural that a man whose parents had been viely slandered should be xious, even ater an interval of balf a century from their deaths, to recue their characterg I from the calumnies which had been heaped upon them, and to prove that his mother was from the first, not the mistres, but the wife of his father? Even this scantv measure of0justice Mr. Sheddon could not obtain unless tbeir lord- sip did somethig to open the doors of the courts which were shut against him. He (Earl Grey) was not asking them to reverse by a legislative measure a decision solemnly pronounced in their judicial capacity. Ho Wm not contsthng the correctness in point of law of that decision. Considering the eminence of the judges by 'whom it was pronounced, and his own utter want of legii kn owledMg, it would be worse than presumption in him to do Eo. He did not even say that the law wrhich made that decieion right ought to be altered. Dificult as it was to reconcile the operation of that law in the present instance with the principles of justice, he was still, in deference to authority, ready to believe that in order to avert the great evils of protracted litigation, and to protect the holders of propert from 'vexatious suits, it was proper to maintain that state of law. Bnt, granting that that mnust not be disturbed, he asked again, was the fact that Mr. Sheddon had, under there unexampled circumstances, been by a cruel and heart'lss fraud stripped of his property any reason for refusing him the opportunity of provt that he was the legitimate son of his father. and was entitled to be consi. dered a British subject? That question had never to this moment undergone any investigation whatever, and he claimed from their lordships that there might be a proper ad de inulry into the faet of the prior marriage of yr. and Mrs. Mheddon. That was the object of the motion which he was about to make. When he had presented this petition he should rsove that it be referred to a select committee. He should take that course because, while he was quite certin that some icief ought to be given to Mr. Sheddon, he was not ;.reparedtosay in what form it would best be afforded. The committee might recommend eitherthat a private Bil should be passed declaring Mr. Sheddon to be legitimate, or, which he thought more probable, that there should be some genenl legilation 'rovidin; that where the right of a person to be considered a British subject was at stake he should be entitled to bring before a court the question of his legitimacy, although no property might be involved in the queston. It mliht be that some other and better course than either of tnese would be adopted, but, whatever else might be done, he maintained that their lordshipr -were, upon a principles of justice, bound to inquire whether the statement which he had made could be substantiated, and in what manner relief could be afforded. He earnestly hoped that his noblo and learned friend upon the woolsack would not resist the appointment of a select committee; and, above all, he trnsted that no opposition would be offered to his motion on the part of Mr. Patriclr, or by those who called themselves his friends; because if there was any one who was deeply interested in having this mnquiry, it was Mr. Patrick himself. (Rear, hear.) The charge3 which he had brought against Mr. Patrick Were oF tue gravest description; and he thought he might venture to say that he had made out a primd facie case of suspicion against that gentleman, If, therefore, he shrank from inqUir,-if by the mouth of any friend of his in that House he should object to inquiry, he would at once convert that which wasnoW suspicion into conviction in the mind of every impartialman. If he felt himselfinnocenthe vould courtinquiry. Thefeelingofaninnocentmanwouldbe to take every means to set himself right in the estimation of bisfriends. He understood that Mr. Patrick had intimated to some of their lordasips that if Mr. Sheddon could be subjected to cross*exammation evidence must be drawu from his own monthl which would explain away a great part of the statement just made, (Hear.) But on the pat of Mr. Sheddon he wa authorized to Eay that there was nothing which he so ardently deired as to be subjected to tne ordeal of the most searching cross-examination. His wish was that every document, every paper which boreupon these transactionsshould be laid befoketheir lordship, that every witness who knew anything of them. should be thorogly examined, 2and he was persuaded that the result would be to p rove beyond all doubt the accuracy of that statement which he had just laid before their lordships. The noble lord concluded by moving that the petition be ref;erred to a select com-mittee. The LORD CHAcELLOL said that though this motion was one relating exclusively to the private interes's of two individuals, yet in the principle which it involved it was, in his opinion, one of the greatest social questions which had ever been laid before their lordships, He could well conceive referring the conduct of public men, or of any men in connexion with public transactions to a select committee; but it was absolutely unprecedented that their lordships should be asked, even after thera had been almost interminable litigation upon the matter, to refer itto a select oommitte to inquire whether the petitioner had any legal ground of compalnt-and asked, too, after a speech in which absent persons were charged with an unmitigated system of fraud-a speech which would be circulated throughout the country, andto which it awas im. posdble to give any answer satisfactory to the feelings of the gentleman who had been accused If this individual had any legal ground of complaint the courts were open to him; if not, a committee of their lordships' House w not the proper tribunal to give him redrew. On- public grounds alone that was an all.suifflcent reason for resisting the inquir, and he should have hesitated to say another word were it not that he-felt it due to the gentlemsn accusa in some slight 4egree to show how a portion of the charge made against him could be explained away. The facts of the case haa been pretty correctly stated. Mr. Sheddon was a Scotchmn, -who went to America in the year 17-64 when only 17 years of age. There he lived, the remainder of his life exoept for a year an - half, which be pssed in Scotland in his father's house, and there he died. ewas engodmin commerce, and made a fortune more or less large-that a's a matter of question -and he hatd a small estate in sotland, to which he sueceeded on the death of his father, which his brother-in-Iaw, and, after his death, his brother.in.law's brother, managed in hisr absene, -Mr. Sheddor died in November, 179t , and a er wai it the managment of not derived frhutheohadogathered from the papperintie case, he felt bound to say that, after having maade himself thoroughy mtaster of these paper his impresdon was that he was an upright, honest man (hea, hear); andl be was informed by several noble lords who cainefrom that part of the country thst that was the character which he had borne through life, and which at the age of 87 he had hoped to -rtamin without further molestation. A very short time before his death Mr. Sheddon married a woman named inA Wilson. Alhat theth P atrick knewofthispatofthecas was derived from correspondence whiclh t'hey received from America. It was now t sh ete by the Sheddons that this arc o nw wt remarkable thali t it was allstted bt thtinas Vaparf their own case. 'The first intiinatio whmih the atnior received of Mr. ShedO's tarrnage ws by a letter written by Mr. Robert Patrick, whohAd formerly been enagagedain business inNew Yo*T to}th Mr. Sheddon, to mr. Wbiani Patrick in Scotl4ud, in which he states that Mr. -Sbtddon's illness was rapidly hurreing him to his grave, and tba' I he had jut maried dwoman who had beeon long ivng with bini as his mistress, lfor ther, puowe of eofe.rri the rI' ts of legitimacy on his ckiren by her. About thle same time a letter was writtn by. John Pjij to Rtobert Sheddono, ,a mercbhanlt In ondon, in which ii, spoke of his uncle haiving married jusBt before his. de~Ah a iionlan to.with whom he ha long livediinaanotber wlion.,' Ouch 12thI of Noyeamber, I79SKWillam Shsdde hitaseli ~'wrote alette to his nephew, Willim Patrik,s in which be stated that he bad " married Ann Wilson," a thing "which Fas approved of" by his friends in Newv York, and which 1- restored her and the two fine children she had had byhimn to honour and credit." (Hear, heat.) Was it possible that a inan could have written in such language of his marriage. of he believed that the woman was really his wife by a civil m arriage tbat bad Kpeviously taken place? The letter proceeded to say that his son was to be sent to Scotland to his mephew to be educated; that he had granted a sum for that -purpose; and that he vished his son to be put to a pro. fetsion suited to his position. A letter was also received by william Patrick from his brother John, stating the abovs particulars, and informicz him that the boy had been left by his father to his (Willam's) guardianhip. These letters, and many others wih might be quote, vent to show the estimate which all parties at the time had of the connexion that existed between William Sheddon end this woman. As soon as these matters came to the knowledge of William Patrick he felt himself placed in a delicate position, because if the marriage was a valid one the question arose whether the law of Scotland applied to persons married in America. If the marriage was valid according to the law of Scotland, then the son of William Sheddon wvas entitled to the Scotch estate; but if not, then his brother Robert, as the heir at law, was entitled to take possession. The correspondence that took place between William Patrick end the executors at New York clearly showed the embarrassment he felt, and that he was most explicit in pointing out the propriety of some other person than himself taking up the case of the boy Sheddon. An application was made to the Court of Session, and the .esult was the appointment of Mr. Hugh Craufurd in, loco tutoris. lt was very easy to talk of conspiracy now, but what proof was there? William Patrick wrote to America to say that he was embarrasEed by the' guardianship imposed uDon him, as his own brother's interests were involved in it, andrecommiending that an independent person should be appointed, A more natural course than this could not possibly have bean taken by him under the circumstances of the case. Shortly after the death of her husband the widow married a person named Vincent, and on the 3d of September, 199, she wrote a letter to Robert Patrick, asking him to interest himself in the case of her children. Before stating the contents of this letter he would remind the lHouse that the relations of Mir. Sheddon never at any time looked upon her as a trustworthy woman, but, on the contrary, regarded her as a disreputable person. In the letter to which he had referred she stated that her late husband had made his last will and testament a short time before his death; that he had in the most affectionate terms recommended his son to the guardianship of William Patrick; that the small property in Scotland would be required for bis supporb ; 'and that she trusted he would stand forward as his pro. tector; that she had heard a report that her late' husband's relations meant to claim the estate on the pretence of the illegitimacy of the child, but that the fact was "tbe marriage was solemnly performed and the will as regularly executed as any two acts of this mature could be." Now, he called their lordships' attention to the circumstance that no reference was here made to any previous marriage. Could any human being suppose that if this woman believed she had been married eight years before she would bave kept it concealed on an occasion of this kind? (Bear, hear.) She added that she could give the most ample testimony to the facts she had furnished. There was furnished a certificate by the officiating clergymaan settirg forth that W, Sheddon and Ann Wilson were reg_larly married by him on the 7th of March, 1798, and on that certificate Ann Wilson reliee for its being a valid marriage. There were two affidavits in proof of the marriage, in which the deponents stated thatMr. Sheddon and Aan Wilson had previously lived together as man and wife- but, in fact, although it might be true that Ann Wilson bad berne Mr. Sheddon's name, yet it was impossible there could have been any prior marriage, for had there been she would not have been married again in the name of Ann Wilson. That being the case, many opinions were taken both in the United States and Scotland as to the effect of the subsequent marriage upon the children. Mr. Patrick then suggested that a factor loeo tutoris should be appointed by the Court of Session to protect the intereste of the infant, That was done, and the question was elaborately argued before the Court of Session as to what was the effect of the marriage subsequent to the birth of the infant, such marriage being contracted abroad, and notin Scotland. The question turned upon the point whether the person so marrying abroad was domiciled there, or only temporarily resiodent cum animo retcrterdi. The conclusion of the Court of Session vas that Mr. Sheddon's marnage did not make the children legitimate, and was incapable of doing so. T4e noble earl bad put forward as a mark of great fraud the fact that it was at the instance of Mr. Patrick that an pyeal wvas prosecuted in their lordships' House. Assuming tt to be the casc, he (the Lord Chancellor) could see no Fraud at all in such a proceeding, wbich was a commop and unobjectionable one, and was intended to obtain a confirmation of the judgment of the Court of Session. Upon that appeal the judgment of the Scotch conut was affirmed, and the estate, of course, went to Mr. Robert Patrick. If there bad been any fraud at all it was impossible to conceive how that gentleman could have been mixed up in it, seeing that he was serving abroad the whole time, It was true that he subEequently sold the estate to WilliamPatrick, hut that did not alter the fact that the person benefited by the judgment of the Court of Session was Mr. Robert Patrick, then in the Mediterranean. The matte might have been supposed to have terminated. The boy was educated, the money properly applied, and he went to sea. It had been statedy that the ]ad was urged by his uncle, William Patrick, not. to become a lawyer. That perhaps was very good advice, and was the advice which he. the Lord Chancellor) frequently gave; and to charge fraud upon a person for giving such a recommendation to a lad, who was perhaps ill adapted for the profession, was absurd and unjust. The lad., iowever want to sea, came home, and went out several tumes, but it was not until 1848 that he was advised by some person to reopen the whole case which had been concluded 40 years previously. Mr. Sheddon Instituted a proceeding in the Court of Session, and, In order togivehimeelf a locuSta1Znd4 healleged that the former proceedings in 1803 had been fraudu ent,and that documents bearinguponhisaeFehadbeen intentionally kept from the Court, but there was no suglgestion of a former marriage. In the first summons fraud was alleged against the Patricks only, but afterwards there came a supplemental summons of 80ages, inwhich itwasfor the first time alleged that Mr. Craufurd had been aparty to thefraudpractisedupon the petitioner. Thatwasavery gross cbarge to make against a man for the first time 26 yeara after his death, and, moreover, when, as far as he (the lrd Chancellor) could see, there was no evidence to support it. At the end of 1850, just as the record was about belog closed and a fArther evidence excluded, the petitioner dise covered that hlr. and Mrs. Sheddon bad been previously mar. nied by civil contract, and was allowed by the Court of Session to amend his summons In that respect. The Etatement InEerted in the record was that prior to the birth of the child Mr. and Mrs. Sheddon had been marrlel according to what was called in Scotland habit and repute. It was the law in Scotland that iftwo persons lived together as manL and wife, and wore generally received as such, that afforded pregnant evidence that they had been married, but it did sot constitute marriage, because it could be rebutted by evidence that they had not been married. The object of the suit was to get rid of everything that had been done, and, inter alia, a final decree of the House of Lords. The Court declded that there was no ground for the action, and that judgment was confirmed by their lordships.' At that tme not a word was said of a prior marriage in the eense in which the term was used now. The statement made then was quite consistent with the bastardy of the child-siz, that Eeople understood them toboh married because they always passed as man and wife; but the fact that they were not married was proved by the clearest evidence, and if the child at the moment of birth was a bastard he was also an alien, and no subsequent act of his parents could invest him with any other character. It would be a most dangerous precedent if, after a case had~ been litigated with a degree of pertinacity without example1 in any court of justice, a person was to be allowed through the instrumentality of the great talents and high influence of Iis noble friend to attack the character of a masnk in into the grave at the ago of 87, after a life of reputatio and honour, inviting him to a new course of litigation which might involve him in ruin, and which perhaps could. mot be terminated before his death. (Hear, hear.) As to the notable, suggestion to pass a Bill to declare the: petitioner a natural,-bors subject, supposing thereowas a prior marriage, there was nothing in the decision of their lordships' House to make the etitioner other than a naturali 'born subject. All that their ordsbips had decided they hadt (decided upon the facts there stated i and the facts did not: include the marriage of 17&G, according to the laws of New. York, before witnesses. If then the fact of that marriage ~couldbe roved, the petitioner wantedno Act of Parliament~ -to enablem to asserthis rights, (Hear.) Not as the advocate! of Mr. Patrick, but as the advocate of the people of Eng-; land, and as the advocate of every one to whom property) and character were sacred, he trusted he had succeeded in' inducing their lordebipo to resist this attempt, which was' -entirely unprecedented, and likely to lead to consequaence: 'impossible for their lord3hips to foresee. (Cheers.n) Lord BROUGEHAl agreed that they had engaged in. 3 dificult and painful inquiry, but believed that no person ,could have done more ample aud entire justice to oase so complicated than had been done in the clear,; ,elaborate, and lucid statement of the noble earl wbho e,psned the debate. (Hear, hear.) Two matters were. -ow before their lordships for consideration-fiirst -whethez an error of fact was committed, and an erroneous -decision come to in conseqnence of that error of fact, viz., ignorance of the marriage of 1790; and, secondly, wvhether, ssfter long adverse possession and several judgments, they lad the means of redressing the grievance of the parsy injiud. His opinion was that there was a marriage in 2790, and that the children were born in lawful wedlock. 'The noble and learned lord on the woolsack had taken no; 2sotice of the most material point in the petitioner's casethat decisions of competent courts of America were in his favour. Those cases were strongly contested, and the decisions established legitimnacy by foree of the marriage of 2790. It was argued that the ecclesiastical marriage of 1798 threw doubt upon the former marringe. When engaged in 'Solly's case before the 12 judges in Westminster-hall, he remembered stating, in answer to an observation uVon irregular Scotch marriages, that at the time the Archbishop of tanterbury, the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord Privy Seal -were amenable to censure, if cnsure upon such a ground ,were due. All those three noble persons went through the form of a second marriage In England, thouth Talidly married according to the lavr of Scotland; their wives, no doubt, being remarried in their maiden names beeause It would be very difficult to get a clergyman to solemnnize marriage betweon a mann and a married woman. (A. laugh. It was precisely the samu case here-the marriage of 1790 followed by the maniage of 1798. If they believed in tihe tnarriage of 1700, that disposed of tho question of alienae, and then came the queston whether, after such a lae of time and so many decisions, they otught n to eqeure fraud to be proved before granting . relef, Ast the question of fraud if he was iDegitimate he Therefore an alien, not 6aving been naturalized by the naturalizing statutes But there was never an inq , eitherintheirlordships' Houseorilntheccurtbelowf u to t4D valdity of the original marriage, or touching t sues- tion of fraud. He (Lord Brongham) was therefore, on the whole, strongly inclined to thixk that it would be an advisable counse for their lordsahips now to undertake the inquiry In the manner proposed by his noble friend (Earl Grey). He (Lord Brougham), indeed, did not see how they could get rid of an inquiry of that sort. His noble friend (Earl Grey) might, indeed, present a Bill, as he had a right to do as a peer, and by the courtesy of their lordshies' House, alleging the legitimacyof the petitioner and the rights springing fromthat legitimacy, and reversing the judgment with the view of letting in the prty to a new trial of his claim. That Bill would probably read a first time as a matter of course, and on its second reading he (Lord B3rougham) wa3 inclined to think their lordships would hear the parties on either side. He threw out that suggestion, but on the whole he thought his noble friend (Earl Grey) had taken the proper course in bringing the case before their lordships in the way he had done. Lord ST. LEONAIID'S said, remembering, as he did, that be assisted his noble and learned friend on the woolsack for 18 days in deliberating on this case when it was last before that House, he could not withdraw from the duty which he felt incumbent upon him of addressing their lordships on the present occasion. Voluminous as the papers relating to the case immensely were, he could conscientiously say there was not a single document among them that he did not read with the deepest attention when the appeal came before their lordships' House; and after the most deliberate investigation he came to the clear conviction that-first, in point of law this gentleman was illegitimate, and therefore an alien; secondly, that there was no fraud on which the Court could act; and, thirdly, that there was no marriage fn 1790, such as was now spoken of as an absolute fact. It was important that their loidships should Ece how the matter stood, because it went by stets. When the marriae took place on the 7th of Novembr, 1798, Mir. Slieddon was on his deathbed, and the marriage was solemnized when ie Was in bed, but it was duly solemnized. It was a marrnage well calculated to excite much observation, from the very circumstance that the celebrated man who performed the ceremony knew when he was called on to do so that Mr'. Sheddon was on his deathbed. Besides, M*. Sheddon wrote a letter which, if words could-expre$s any clear notion of a man's mind, deserved to be received with the most impleci faith, and in which he stated that he then married Ann Wilson, in order to restore his cWi. dren to the status to which they were entitled. The 0a4e of the petitioner in every different stage had been always represented in a different manner, so as to meet the particular difficulty with which it was beset. The petitioner himself at one time relied on that letter to show that 31ie dece3sed believed that he was domiciled in Scotland and-! Scotchman, and that his marriage would make the childTre legitimate from their birth; and when the petitioner a his advisers found that that letter did not answer their DU pose they declared that the letter was a forgeryfro beginning to end. Ho (Lord St. Leonard s) state, without hesitation, that there was- no more doubt the trath of that letter than there could be of fact that he was addressing the House at that momen. If a marriage took place in 1790 between Mr. Sheddon aa d Miss Wilson, was it not natural to suppose, when she found that the legitimacy of her son was to be contested, that slle would have said,-"Although I was married to my husbaxgd upon his deathbed in a proper and regular manner, I-ha4 be,pn preniously married to him by civil contract, and befom e witnesreF,,in 17901" Miss Wilson waszrepresented to ha o been the daughter of a gentleman of goodposdtionin society, who objected to her marriage with MWr. Sheddon on tSje ground of her youth and was it likely tht a man in such a station of life would have allowed his daughter to 1e marred in his drawing-room by what was called a civil costract, without the existence of any document which would show that such a ceremony had taken place ? The differenqe between the law of Scotland and that of Americv was this' that in Scotland there was an. assumption of tmarriago, although no marriage had actually taken place, while by the American law there must be a marrla e esther by civil contract. or regularly by the chnrol When the case came by appeal to this House no mentiou was made of the marriage in 1790. ("Hear, hear," fro4i Earl Grey.) Nothing was said of that marriage as a civ ; marriage until it was alUeged in this petition. More tha i that when Mr. Shedden himself commenced proceedings l the 6eurt of Session in 1848, after he had had plenty of tinl to make inquiries, he set forth in his satement that " during Mr. Sheddon's last residence at NTew York hb formed an intimacy and connexiosi with Miss Anu Wilsori, the mother of the pursuer, of which conuexion there were born the pursuer and a daughter, and with the avowed da. poseofl, timatingthepursterand)is sister he 3'ardieth sad AnnVilson at New York on or about the 17th of Nevember,1798."HediedatNew Yorkonthel3th of Novembet, of that year. It was admitted that a civil marriage woulA in Amenca have been perfectly binding but no such marriage was allgged either in 1808 or in 184L. After this Mre. Sheddon obtained leave from the Cortr of Session to put ihi a new statement,-in fact, a new case; andin that he set up a marriage, not by civil contract, but by habit and repute, cohabitation, their living as man and wife and people believing them to be so. Such a marriage would satisfy the law of Scotland, but it would not hold good in America. The Court of Session was of opirion that it had not juris. diction, and the matter came by appeal to theirlordiiips' House. .The oourse there taken was- that they first heard arguments as to wbether the case could be reopened, and then came to the conclusion that they could 'not decide that point of law without hearing the facts. Inno case that ad come before their lordships was there a greatet number of facts- this in tbis - and after hearing them he (Lord St. Leonad's) camo to the clear and decided opiniol that upon the facts the plaintiff was not entitledto relief, and that had he been so he was wrong in the course which he had taken; and therefore he shoildr Eo far as his vote went, have decided agins' him If the House agreed to the suggestion of the noblo earl every man who could make out a new cas would corno their lordships, and upon ane fgrte statement1asifor a ne* triaL In every other court of justice when a man aleged thab he -had found out new facts, and asked thereonfor a new trial, the answer he got. was that he ought to have found them out in time; and there was nothing to show here that the petitioner had been taken by surprise, or-that he had not aUlalong known of the new facts which he now brougbt forward. What was to be done if the petition were referred to a select committee? Surely it was not intended that a select. committee of their lordships' House ws8 to retry a question which bad already been decided twicoe in the Scotch courts and once in their lordshipe' House. Itwas remarkable how the petitioners had shifted their ground. At first they rested on the marriage of 1798, then on the cohabitationmerely.and nowthemarriageof 1790wasbrought forward. It was quite impo6dble to accedo to the proposition of the noble earl without striking a fatal blow at the administration of Justice and at the jurisdiction of their lordahips' FHouse as a court of appeal With regard to MIr. Patrick-though it was no busineas of his to defend him-hA was bound to say that he was of opinion that the case nad not been made out against that gentleman whlch it had been attempted to make out. He was a gentleman of advanced age,andit w rathber hard that he should be exposed to such a powerful attack as that which the noble earl had made uspon him without having a bingle voice raised to say a word i his favour hordi LYNDHoo RST said that after the very able and aearching speech of the noble earl eho had introducedt this motion it wvould not be necessary for him to trouble their lordships at any great length; but he felt it due to the petitioner 'wrho had laid some papers in the case before him, to express his opinion of it. He should begin by stating to their lordshilps what he conceived to be the position of the -petitioner, because that was most mate. rinl to a proper undersanding of the case. In its first shape when it came before their lordships' House, the question was one of law only-for It was never supposed that there was any other marriage than the second regular mar riage. The petitioner supposed that that marriage would have a retrospective effect, as it would have had in Scotland,-but it had no such effect, and tie consequence was that, being born inaforeign oountry and ilegitimate, he was pronounced an alien and incapable of recovering the estate.. But where was the petitioner all this time ? He was a boy! at school, of sin years oi age, and the present defendant,' William Patrick, was his guardian, and had the charge of him. He was in a state of pupilage during the whole time of the trial, and was wholly ignorant of what was taldng place. On arriving at the age of 12 he was putinto thenavy. It was not convenient that he should remnin in England, and atil less that he should be brought up to the profession of the law as he might have been led to explscate the facts, and 6ring the whole tranaction to light. Having no knowledge whatever of the case, being entirely ignorant of the facts, it was not tiU 1833, on his arrival in this oountry, and on going down to Scotland. that he was led to take up the case. He took advice, and instituted now proceedings to set aside the former proceedings on the ound of fraud, The case in due course came to that gouse, when, as his noble and learned friend on the woolsack knew, it was held insufficient to alege general fraud - the nature of the fraud, it wasasaid, mnus be specifically stated, in order to justify the House in setting aside the former proceedings, The Court were of opinion that the allegation of feaud was not proved, and it was on that ground the app?eal was dismissed. (Hesar, hear.IBa I d- tem! cont;rae ineg alt) thc i tn e PrOgres o the case some pght broke in upon the mind of the petitioner as to the first marre of his parents and he began to have reason to believethat o twh s p er fectly regular marriage. It had been assunedl by all parties that there was only one marriage, but William Patrick knew otherwise. A certificate of the first narrTiago was anoed over to him as wei as the oertificate of the second macriage, He therefore knew it, lut he brought forward the evidence of the seond marriage only. On inquiry the petitioner found that his father and mother had been previously married by civil contract in a maner perfectly legal br the law of New York. Chancellor Rent said it Wsu not neces- sary that a clergyman should be present in order to mke a mrriage valid, though doubtless it was a very becoming But~~~~~~~7o the ocdce e eoetatcmision.'r practice and suitable to the solemnity o t oasi that the coneent of the parties only 'was neceary before witnesses, or a sfubsequent acknowledgment of thoe fact; and that& a marriage mnight e ven be inferred from continual cohabitation, except in cases where there might be a civil action for adulter, &c. In additionx to this definition of the law by Chanceor Kent hem ha the certificates of four lawyers of tbhe highest eminence in New York to the same effect. Thi outle.man, then, finding he had reason to believe that his parents had been married bofore the ceremony took place to which alone refereBoe had been made in the case, asked for a. ommission, which was granted, That commission examined witnesse in Amiertca, whose evidende prove& the marriage beyondc a! doubt, and having discharged Its dulty returned to this country. But was the evidenoe taken before that commissi6hb prdduced? 'No; itwas eld in rltenti; it was saidyou cainot prove this marriakge til .the question of fraud is tdis. posped of, when that is done then the evidence may be read. The fra ud a not disposedl of, aLnd in so fari therefore, all the evidenoe has never been produced , thouigh it would most satisfactorily prove,- the reality of the marriage. - But that was fAT item being the whole. The lady who wtA the mother,of- thLe pe=titioner. was the daughter of a British officer who had ditiguished himself very much in the war, And she was living in the immediate neighboniho6d of her father, Was it JWikeY that 4 British officer would suffgr his daughter to be living in a state of cohabitation with ia imerchant in his neighbourhood? (Her, hear.) The whola iobabilityof the crsewas against such a thing. Againi, 0 eentire evidence went to show that this merchant was a man of respectability and of excellenb character, living ia the best society, and that his lady moved also in the best society of the place. (Hear, hear.) That society consisted in great part of Presbyterians, persons of strictly religious and moral character, and the House might be assured that they would never have received the lady unless they were satisfied that she was the wife of Mr. Sheddon. (Hear.) His noble and learned friend on the voolsack suggested that all these things took place after the decision in their lordships' House. This was by no means so. they were dscovered while the case was in progress, After the decision the petitioner went to New York to make further inquiry, and ascertained from a gentlemap named Wood-a lawyer of great eminence, and for whose respectability Mr. Dallas vouched-tbat he was no* in a conaition to prove his status and brinR an action qf ejectment for a property at New York. He accordingly brought an action of ejectment, a great number of witnesses were examined, and the decision of the presiding judges was, after a very few minutes' consideration, given in his favour. The LORD CHANCELLOR.-Were al the facts th"t were brought before this House laid before the jury? Lord LYNDHURST.-The sole question was the corsideration of the marriage. The point was whether the marriage was according to the law of New York, and tl,e judge decided that it was. What facts were necessa'y beyond proving that? When he adverted to the character of Mr. Wood it was suffLicient to show that the case must have boen conducted in a perfectly fair ancd h6nourable manner. The case proved that there was a Previous marriage, quite safficient, accordingtothelawof NewYork,ard that the legitimacy of the children was established. (Hear;) His noble friend had alluded to a document of great importance-a notarial certificate made immediately after-thb death of Mr. Sheddon,. which was sent over by the mothei and which contained ?ipou one paper the ceitificaf; of, the second as well as the certificate of the previous mnarriagb. (Hear, hear.) What did William Patlck do? What would their lordships say ofa man who cut off the evidence of the previous mar e, and prodaced in court only the evidence of the secondt It might be askeÂ¢ how was that known? Mr. Van Hooght, who was ttp administrator of Wim Patrick, was in possessionof afl his papers, nd lupon a search being made copies of those certificates were found in William Patriclks handwritin It was therefore clear that he did cut off literally th; evidence of the first marriage, and made use only of thb evidence of the second marriage, he being at the time'bounto protect the interests of the widow and children. Tbh noble and learned lord upon the woolsack had made a p,i; of the questions-why Was the second marriage in 'the nan of Ann Wilson -when, if the statement of a previous iariage was true, the lady's name was, not Wilson, buj Sheddon; and why was there a second marriage at all if the first'was not bad? The reason for the second iarriag, was that it -would have been attended with great expens5 and difficulty to have proved the first marriage, and the. fore' a course was adopted which was not an unusual one establish the fict more easily. As to the re-marriage in the name 'of' Ann Wilson, it must be remembered that she coula not have been, married in any other name, and of that fad there was a remarkable instance in their lordahips' Housf Lord Eldon, who hid married Miss Snrtees in Scotland~, weg ,afterwsrds again married to the lady ;i. England, not Mr.Scott, but as Miss Surtees. Then came another docuruent, which, if a true document, was decisive. He referred to the letter of the 12th of November, which was supnose to have been written by Mr. Sheddon upon his deathW acknowledging the fact that he hadnot been previ'ously ma; ried. If that letter wnas a genuine document it destroyed th~ poettioner's case, but if itwereafabricatedletter thenthefrara wrould recoil upon those who invented it. The noble an~ learned lord on' the woolsack said the petitioner made tha letter a part of his case, That was trute; but what wvere th 'circumstancess? He used it in support of the averment of th6 'second marriage, and, indeed, as such it was forced upon hiin~ Xnit he afterwards denounced it as a fabrication, and calUe upon his opponents to prove it, They retorted that the~ docuent had been hanwded to the petitioner, who denied that he had ever received it, and invited the other sidet, 'prove that it had ever been given to him, at the sam~ timue ,challenging p roof that it had ever been 'show L to orhad been seen ,by any person. That challenge had bceen declined,' and up' -to the present moment no proot'of that letter hadbeen gsven, (HIear.) Was it likely thUat tkik lawvyer like Mr. Patrick woulld have given up an 'original document so important in its nature without takingr som4 receipt or having the presence of semne wiitness to prove th4 fact? Then, again, looking at that letter itself as putt forth in evidences ltS contents wrere in contradiction of the gre4 mass of evidence wrhich' 4ad been referred to. M6reover~ the letter was dated the 12th of November, Mr. She4idon'* death talking plice "on the 13th, while on the-10th it was stated that he could not turn in his:- beds would never be able to transact business againD nor to' open a single letter. Then, again, the. content l of the letter wrere false. It stated that it conteine4' twou bills of exchange for 4171., to be'applied for the educatic of the boy ; hut it appeared from entries in Mfr. Sheddon'~ ledger that the 4171. -was nof remiitted for anysc am but'was. i'ntenided to' discharge a merchantie dZL RrCa than that, the original of those bills never arrived, and thq papers produced were only copies, not signed by the deceased. That evidence had not been heard by that House or in. the court below, and if the aetiJ~ 'tionerts ' legitimacy wvas established, beyond (Thubt he had been unjustly deprived of his ,esgtate.$ HIe contended, that a committee should be gppoinaed to~ ina,uire wbether any relief could be given, and what, that rehlef should be. *lf after inungthey found that theyi could give no relief thjey would sO reportto the lUorue'; bua if, on the other hand, they found that without infringingt any rle ofiuatlce' they could afeford' relief, they wcirId aot ory thee red,but behappy and most anxious to grant it-~ foritend. 'easos ewe !vl support the motion of his noble: nend. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ H Lord CAlIPELL was sure that their lordships muast! h have heard with pleasure the able speech of his noble and; learned friend, and would not be surprised if, with the; deference which theyfelt for such high authority, theysliould1 agree to the appointment of a select commnittee. 'But he felt it his daty to enter his solemn protest againstn proeeeding which was wholly unprecedented, and which he was satisfied wlold lead to the most serious results. le was not an advocate for Mr. Patrick; he never saw that gentleuman inhis life; and he knew nothing of the ease exeapt what he heard during the hearing of the last appeal. In his opinion, it. was re a arte ical a,' and If injustice had unfortunately been done it' was irremeduable, The Court of Session in 1803 decreedthat the estate in dispute belonged to Robert Patrick, and' not to the petitioner. That decree was confirmed bj the Hoase of Lohds in1808. His noble and learned friend who spoke last said that he eoncurred in the decision of their lordships in 1808 and also in that of 1852. Nothing could be easier than to demonstrate from those concessions that a e ommittee ought not to be appointed The decisions' of, the House of Lords vere to the effect thatthe suit bad been condacted without fhad, and that the Judgment of the Coart below could not he a 1 peaehed, but must stand as a lawgful and riehtful judgment.: iy that judgment, so confirmed by the ouse of Lords under the adavice of Lord esdon and Lord Redesdale, tbe estate was declared to be the property of Robert Prick. It was plsin, therefore, that the decision of 1808 could not be reopened. The main argument ia the subsequent suit was that what was callede the second marriage had a retrospective effect and rendered the child legitimate- but he mantained that even sa posing the second mrie haed been proved it wrould have be impossible to set aside the former decision. 1what did they now propose to do? The present was notea judicial proceeding. There were no prties; no newt suit had been comemenced therel was no appeal before their lorshipes, and they cied not orate a cause. Be hxd a sincere respectfor their lordships, but he could not contemplatewlthoutalarmthe consequences which would follow if; at the instance of parties who hadadopted the reprehenible system of personal solicitation, they proceeded to disturb a solemn decision of the court of last resott by the appointment of a select committee. It was impoAtble to take the estate from Reobert Patrick; it was his b the law.of England; ad If Mr. Sheddon eould establish the prior mnarriae, {or which a Parliamentary inquiry was not, necessary, every privilege of legitimacy would belong to hin.,' and he did not profess to want more. Thocomparson of Mr. Sheddon's mriagewithuLord. b1s'5 wras perfectly preposterous. There ws noletter fronithe distingished ladyhom Lord Eldon married, stating that hame sond mit leas contracted to make her an aonest weomn and render her ohildrenoblegitiaate; but the letters of Mfr. and Mrs Sheddon proved that they had only coha. bited together, and that they knewr their children were illigit7atec. If he were to enter upon the merits, he midht show that the merits were against the petitioner- but had said enough to eatiy their lordships that the lawof the land had irrevocably oiven the esate to M r. Patrick,. and that no good whtever could arise from yielding to the prayer of the petition. (Hear.) e The Earl of EGLINTO&UN thought that' Mr. Willi1am Patrick, with whom he was acquainted, and whom he Inew to bDe a aman of irreproachable character, had been meoet unfairly and cruelly attacked. The three brothers were charged with fraud. Of Johi he knew nothing. Of Dr. Robert he only knew that he was very mnch respected in hii profes. sFon, that he was a surgeon in the army, and that he was afterwards appointed Surveyor-General of Hospitals. Looking at the whole case. he couldse no grounds for imputation upon Mr. William Patrick. Mr. W. Patrick could do no other*ise than he did. Believing that Mr. Shedden had been living with a woman, and had had two children by her, and on his deathbed had msrried her, he took tens to raise the question whether such a marriage contraotea in America would hold good in Scotland. It was decided by thb Court of Sessidn that the marriage did not legitimatize the children. and the decision was confirmed by appeal to the House of Lords. Great stress was laid upon the certifi. eates having been cut off from the certificate of the former muariage, but he had been informed by a noble lord within the Isst few minutes that the certificates were not tut off by r. W. Patrick' -that thiy were sent L from America by 'Mrs Vincent ;'tlat' Mr. W. Patrick sent them to his brother. in America stating h s opinion'that such documents must.be forged. When such a fact wa capable of being clearly and casily expliined it proved how unfair it W to asperse' the character of a man of 87 upon transcetions which occurred many year ago, He was ready to admit, that .the position of Air. Sheddon was no* very differentfrom that which he occupied'when the appe4i was brought,tand to give the benefit of his conviction tha6 fr. Sheddon ramight'considerhimself legitin4ate. The Earl of ALBEMAARLE did 'not 'see how the Patrict Ifamfly'eonld be4 justifid; exceptat the expense 'of the She&idon'family who, ha Ihougiht had been most cruelly tieatecf.

Mh.'ADDERLEY wisbed tomsk whither any and what arrage-ine2t' idea iid for the transmision of moo ils'to and from the Anstfalian colonies, including the branch servioes to Soth Australl, Van Dieme'' Land, and New forred had undoubtedly been regarded for a considerable time as a blot on our legidaltion (hear, hear), and the best proof that this measere was not brought in on the BpUr of the occasion was that, with respect to tho greater 3umoer of the gross and most distressing exhibitions of fraud which to the opprobrium of the country had recently occarred, tha law had met the transgreBsion aud punibhed it. This evil, however, still remained, which for reasons ho had previously stated had not been included in the definition of larceny, and had, thedorer, escaped punishment. He was perfectly well aware of the difficulties attending the introduction of the measure. MAny had deoired to meet the evil, hut fewv had been bold ciough to submit a proposition on the subject. The necessity for legislation, however, was universaly felt, (Hear, hear.) Let not the House, then, be deterred by representations that there might be this or that danger from endeavouring to deal with the i subject. If there were evil in the way it must be raet and surmounted, and he was perfectly confident that the members of that House, when they applied themselves in committee to the Bil, which ho admitted might need amendment, would be able to put the Bill in a sha which would make it worthy to be added to the legiation of the country as a means of meeting great and scandalous fraud, and removing a blot which was now an opprobrium to thejurisprudenceof the country. (Hear, hear.) The Bill was then read a second time. The General Board of Health Bill was also read a secoud time. SAVINGS-BANKS (No. 2) BIIL On the motion that this Bill be read a second timne, Mr. TURNER said that he approved highly of the principle involved in the Bill, that the Government should give security, not only to the depositors to the extent of the money placed by the conductors of savings-banks in the hands of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, but that that security should be extended to all deposits made in the savings-banks, for by means of those deposits an Immense finanoial power was placed in the hands of the Government. While the Governmnent gave security to the depositors they were entitled to exercise the power of investigating the mange ment and affairs of the banks; but he feared they might carry that vower of interference too far. He knew there were instances of defalcations, such as those in the Dablin and Rochdale banks, im zespect to which some blame wis attached to the Government that the were not sooner discovered ; but if interference under the present Bill should be carred so far as to disgust the conductors of reUl managed banks great mischief would be the result In Manchester the savings-bank was managed by gentlemen who devoted to that purposeagreatamount of ability and talent, and it would be a great evil if such men should be disgasted by unnecessary interference on the part of the Governmen'. He wished the Government had complied with the prayer of the numerous petitions which had suggested that the BiU should be referred to a specia committee In order that a measure might have been agreed on satisfactorY to all parties. He did not wish to oppoe the second reading of the Bill, but he trusted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would state that he did not wish to interfere with those gentlemen who took an active part in well-managed banks. Let the Government insist on some mode by which the accounts could be ch,eked, but when a savings-bank was wel managed let there be no interference on the part of Govemment offlcialp. Mr. GROGAN informed the hon. member that in the case of the Dublin bank referred to the Government neglected their duty; for, according to the blue-book, the Government were perfectly aware of the irregularities, but for public purposes It was convenient to connive at them, and the consequence -was that the depositors were deprived of their just rights. Any measure, therefore, to prevent the occurrence of such an evil must be a great boon to depositors, but the Government must take care not to diEgust the gentlemen -who took on themselves the management of savings-banks by unnecessy interference on the part of Government officials. The Government should arrange a scale of saaries and of interest, and beyond that they should not unduly interfere in the management of these banks. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated on a previous occasion that he would attempt, before the second reading, to put In a distinct form the conditions necessary to be complied with, in order that these banks should have the full benefit of the present Bil, and he hoped that the right hon. gentleman would on the present occadon state to the House what those conditions were. (Hear, hear.) Mr. AYRTON considered that the objections to the Bill were so serious that, were It not for the general desire which appeared to exist in the House that it should be read a second time he would havo felt bound to move that it be read a second time, that day six months. It was neary that the attention of the House should be caled to ithe state of these savings-banks, and more especially to the constitution of the Government Board which had attempted to undertake, but which had not really undertaken, the duty of watching over the funds of those institu tions, for of all the boards ever constituted by Parliament none had exhibited such an entire absence of all those qualities which might be expected from a public body. Many members might be aware of tho large deficiencies which had been brought under the notice of the Houe by an hon. gentleman opposte (Sir H. Willoughby) on a previous occasion, but perhaps few had taken the trouble toinquire into the cause of that deficiency, and for his own part he could say that when he came to inquire into the cause he had been startled at the neglect whichhadbeen exhibitedby thecommisioneinakeeping these banks on such a footing. Savings-banks were first established in the year 1817, and the Parliament of that day had begun upon the erroneous principle of allowing the depositors a larger rate of interest than the funds in the hands of the commissioners could produceB. It seon became manifest that there Was a considerable defidency between the interest which the commissioners received and that which they alowed, and in the course of a few yers that deficiency amounted to no less than 588,2161. Inthe year 1828 the commissioners had thoughtfittobringthesubjectunderthe notice of the House of Commons, and the rate of interest allowed by the commissioners was then reduced to 31. l6o. per cent. It soon appeared, however, that from varions causes it was impossible to pay that rate of interest without incurring a loss, and in 1843 the deficiency had amounted to no lees than 2,171,1921. Another attempt was then made to meet the difficulty by reducing the rate of interest to 31. 5s. At that time it would have been possible by proper investments to obtain a rate of interest sufficient to pay the depositors and leave a surplus, but the Commissioners did not examine fully into the circumstances of the times, and the investments which they made did not return a sufficient rate of interest to pay the depositors, so that the deficiency had gone on accumulating, until in 1855it amounted to 2,962,0001., whichmight be looked upon as a capital debt. Such had been the results of the dealings with regard to interest, but the dealings with the capital fund had been no lees unsatisfactory. In 1817 there had been a surplus of nominal capital of 232,5501, In 1827 the surplus of nominal capital was 1,291,1701. In the year 1828 the comnmissioners obtained power to invest the capital in Ex. chequer-bills, and in 1843 the surplus of nominal capital had been reduced to 135,4801., and the deficit since 1843 had been 1,680,0001., the total result being that there was a deficiency fromn 1843 to 1855 of 1,00.0,OO0 Such had been the result of the management of these banks by the commissioners; and the very serious question then arose as to whether they were fit to be trusted with the iananement of the affars of the savingsbanks, and certainly it was a narvellous thing that they should have managed in 12 years to create a deficiency of 1,000,000u. Even since 1855 the management of the commsoners had not in degree improved, and it certainly bad not been cal bee to increase the confidence of the public. What had been the nature of the dealngs of the commissioners since 1855 was seen from a return which haa blen laid upon the table of the House, and certainly itwas entirely at variance with what he had always understood to be the mode of dealing with regard to investments. He found that in July, 1854, the funds were at 91; in Dewember they had fallen to 87, and then the commissioners sold to the extent of nearly half-a-million of money. No doubt the ChanceUlor of the Exchequer might have een things in a different light from the public, and, from what he knew of the state of affairs, might have anticipated a further fall; but certainly no further faU occurred. On the contrary, a turn took place ; the funds rose to 89, without any impression prevailing that they were likely to sink again, or that they were likely to remain so low. They again sold largely. It was by such means as that that from time to time up to the present day a sumn of 1,200,0001. had been lost to the public. It might be contended that the money had been laid out for the benefit of the country; but the question then arose whether it ought not to have been kept apart as a guarantea for the amount deposited in the savings-banks, ard whether it was ever meant to be placed at the disposal of a body of commissioners, to be made use of, perhaps, in order to proP up a system of finance which might otherwise bave failed, because it had not been based upon sound and legitimate principles? (Hear.) Now, his first objection tothe ABill under thenotice of theHouse was that it did not deal with the important questiouother those commissioners were to be allowed to use the capital of the savings-bank^s without making effectual prevision for the annual interest due to te depositors. 't hat, however, w/as not his .only objeuton t tlle masvure. He was opposed to i-t- also, u-poJn th ground that itproposed to establish Government savings. banks throughout the country-a proposition which he regarded as pernicious in principle and calculated to be still more pernicious i its effects. He felt bound to protest against the Bil as one of a series the tendency of which was to increase the control of the Government over the action of the people. (Hear, hear.) If the House was prepared to legisla.te in that direction, if is was prepared to do the business of stockbroker for the public he did not see why the prnciple shoulI not be earied atiU further, and why the aale of bread should not, as at Paris, be 3 egulated by means of a Government agency. (Hear, hoar.) The Bill was, in fact, in principle a measure of the purest Socialist character, and, he having studied the works of the Sociast writers of France, must say that while he derived pleasure from the beauty of their composition he had become perfectly sensible to the necessity which existed for avoiding acting upon the views which they advocated in any legislative measure in that House. Theiridea was that it was the duty of a Government to discharge every function for the people which they imagined could, by the aid of a certain machinery, be better performed than each individual could accomplish it for himself. Before the Parliament of this country embarked upon such a conurse they ought, in his opinion, to be well satisfied that an imperious necessity for it adoption prevailed. No such necessity, ho must contend, existed in the present in. stance. So far as his experience went, savings-banks were in the greater number of instances most efficiently managed-by the aid of the local gentry, and the principle of that management was one which he should be delighted to see encouraged. There was, in his opinion, nothing more conducive to bind the humbler to the more influential and wealtby classes than a system of that nature, and he could c onceive no course more calculated to destroy that sympathy wbich It was so deeirable to see prevail between the higher and the lower classes than that by which the free action of the gentry should be superseded by a etipendiary agency maintained out of the revenues of the State. (sear, hear.) Such a sipendiary agency it was proposed to establish under the operation of the Bil under discussion. It was simply a secondary featurQ of the meeasure but It provided that, bauks now in exstence might or might not accet tke guarartee which wAs held out to them. Once havtng accepted that guarantee, however, they woald be subjece to sUOh ruleg aS tho Government migzht deam it desirable to lay dosn, and the result would be a ste in the direction of the system which obtained on the Continent, where every function of the community was usurped by what was called tho civil service of the country. (Hear, hear.) To any such system asthat he forone was moststrenuouslyopposed. (Cries of "Divide, divide ") Some hon. members, no doubt, objected to all comment which was adverse to the Government; but happily the location of those gentlemen in the House pretty dennrly indicated the spirit by which their interruption was oceasioned. (Hear, hear.) There was, besides those which he had already mentioned, another most eeiousojection to the Bill. Its provisions were not of that precise and intelligible nature which It was so so desirable they should be. In his opinion, before any great change in the law relating to savings-bauls was effected, those laws which were already in existence upon the sabject ought to have been consolidated. Instead of that course having been taken, however, the Bill simply set forth that all the existing Acts should be deemed to be altered so far only as they were inconsistent with the Dresent measure. Now, inasmuch as the various clauses ofthe existing Acts were extremely numerous it would require the exercise o2 no ordinary intelligence toascertain how the law after the passing of the Act would really stand, and such he mnst maintain was not the mode in which a Bill dealng with a subject so important ought to be framed. Ho should be disposed to remit this Bill back to the Government in order that some of the clauses might be reconsidered, and the whole of the law on the subject of savings. banks consolidated. Very few provisions would be sfficient tosecurethedepositorsagainstloss If an audit wereneces. sary the trustees and managers might be called upon to aop-. point a local auditor. It would be impossible, -with out an enormous expense, to send these stipendiary auditors about the country. A large staff of Governmient auditors would be required, and more money would be spent i in their wa aderings &bout the coantry than would be spent in the discharge of their duties upon the spot. (Hear, hear.) What objection could there be to allowing the trustees of savings-banks themselves to elect a board in London for the Purpose of taking charge of the aggregate funds of the banks ? Such a board would be greatly preferable to any Government board. It would do everything that could be expected from a Government board, and it would make the savingsbanks independent of the Government. At present, when the funds were high the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the time being was tempted to tamper with the inters. The last time the funds were at per the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to reduce the nterest to little more than 2Z. 10s. per cent. for the depositors. If. instead of being obliged to invest the savings-banks money in COns,r suec a board as he had described were alowed a larger discretion, they might discover perfectly safe investments, which would enable them to allow an interest of probably three ox four per cent. At prescntthe depositors complained of the low rate of interest. (" Divide I") If other members had appeared likely to support him he should have been inclined to move that the Bil be read a second time that day six months. Mr. IrCANN boeleved that the public, who knew their own interests better than they were supposed to do were unanimous in applauding the measure of the Chancelor of the Exchequer. (Cheers.) He had seldom known a measure which had beeu received with such universal approval. He could by no means approve the seheme of the hon. and learned gentleman to transfer the management of the funds of the savings-banks to a body of gentlemen such as he had described. (Hear, hear.) Sir H. VERNEY thought It reasonable, if the Government were to guarantee the depositors their money, that they should have the appointment or control of the officers of the banks. He did not, however, wish to see the House devolvIng upon others the powers of legislation which the House itself ought to exercise. The depositors in savin g-banks at present put their money in those Ititutions rom their confidence in those trustees and managers whom they knew. It was to the interest of these institutions that they should do so, and great good was done by the advice given by these gentlemen to their servants, labourers, and dependents to invest their money in savigs8-banks. He should lke to see the whole question referred to a select committeo. (Hear.) It would be said that it was desired thereby to defer the Bill for a year, but it was so importaut to legislate wisely on such a subject that he should be happy to support a motion for referring the Bill to a seleot committee. Mr. BARROW had no desire to see the Bill referred to a select commiitee. (Hear. hear. He could not agree that the country was crying for this BiU, for the principle of the measure vwas that Parliament was asked to transder the powerof maklng the laws to a single individual or tos board. All the regulationsgaaranteed byexistingActsof Parliament were swept away in the words which authorizedthe Government to makeregulatlonsthatwoidhavethe force of law. The arbitrary system proposed to be established by the Goverrnment might also disgust thousands of poor depositors, and induce them to withdraw their money from these banks. 31r. ESTCOURT said, whatever advantage there might be in the old system, depositors found by experience that it did not always secure them the repayment of their money. The new system, however, would afford such a security, as under it the Government would be responsible for the last farthing of the deposits. If they were approaching this subject for the first time, the plan pro ptosed by the government might not be the best that could be devised. If the trustees and managers who now spoke in the name of the depositors would engage to become prsonally responsible for all doposits intrusted to them, it would be better to continue the old system. Centralization was, no doubt, the chief object of this measure; bat the practical difficulty they had to deal with was the want of some solid secuity for the poor depositor. It waa all very well to condemn Governmnent interference - but had they not heardof the defalcations at Rochdale, Dabli, and many other places 1 (Hear.) He had obtained a return of the savings-banks in which there had been defalcations during the last five or six years, and found that they were 11 in number. This document ought to be carefuUy studied by hon. gentlemen who talked of rejecting this BilL These defalcations arose for the most part through the roguery of some officer in whom the most implicit confidence had been placed, and whose integrity was supposed to have been tested by long service. There was actually a case in which an officer absconded at the very time wben a correspondence was pending betwieen the managers of the savings-bank and the NationaL Debt Commissioners, with a view to procure for him an additional gratuity for his long and faithful services. Again, the books of the Rochdale bank were allowed by the actuary sent down from London to inspect them to be weU kept, and its audit to be satis. factory. Bnt, considering the nature of the business transacted, the most praiseworthy efforts of the local managers failed, under the present law, to ensure a perfect audit. Those managers or trustees might be excellent men of business, but their supervision only extended over one week at a time - and the managers who succeeded themu at the end of tee week knew nothing of the state of matters beyond what the actuary told them. Indeed, most of the frauds that had occurredarose from amanager having no adequate means of checking the figures put before him. The law of savings-banks as it now stood was a disgraceo to Parliament. (EHear, hear.) Fresh defalcations took place almost every wear, and the Governmeat were constantly applied to in the name of the industrioua classes for a remedy. The Government had long been believed by the public to be responsible, and nothing b it repeated acts of insolvency had at length disabused tie popular mind of that grievous misconception. If tho lo ial managers would not themselves afford the poor man a sbstantWl security for his deposit, let them not stand in the way of the Government's doing so. So far from apprehe iding that the interference of the Government under this BiU would be too great, his only fear was lest they would not be armed with sufficient power (a laugh), for it must be remnembered that, in undertaking to repay every depositor to the last farthing, they were assuming a very heavy responsibility. (Hear, hear.) Honourable mana7ers and honest actuaries need not dread the interference of the Governnent, which would have enough to do in looking after really suspicious cases, to think about meddling vexatiously with banks conducted on tolerably sound prnciples. Ir some such Bil as the present wera not soon adopted the poor man would be induced to withdraw his money from these institutions, and might cease to have confidence, not in the Government only, but in Parliament also. He trusted, therefore, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would perserve with his measure, which would be a boon to the humble and thrifty depositor. He hoped that the Government would give to the country ample information of the manner in which the money placed in the hands of the commissioners by the directors of savings-banks had been applied; and that with the view of proving the groundlessness of those enspiClous observations which had been made against the Bill the Government would consent to its being sent to a select committee. (Hear, hear.) 7Mr. ATHERTON said this was a Bil for the benefit of the poor man, and he had no doubt that the poor man's Hous e no labour in making the Bill as por- fect as possible, ie objected to certain portions of the Bill, but, as he was anxious that it should become law, he would heartily vote for its secoad reading, and endeavour to amend it in committee. In its present shape the Bill endangered the stability, perpetuation, asd efficacy of savings-banks-first, because it would compel the depositor under &serious penalty to deposit his banking-book from time to time for the purpose of comparison and examination by a Government officer. Now, in many instances the depositor lived at so great a distance froiu the savings-bank that he could net, without great personal inconvenience and expense, deposit his book. The result, therefore, of such a compulsory regalation as to the deposit of the banking-books wonld be t, deter many people from depositing their money ic these banks. The next reason why he apprehended that th i Bill, as it stood, would endanger the existence of these banks was that many of those gentlemen whose support and countenance was necessary fer the establishment and c,ntinuanc, of savings'-banks would be induced to withdraw their support by a feeling that the Government intended to interfere too much in their msasgement. He approved of the suggestion that the Bill should be referred to a select committee, and boped that it would by that process underno as satisfactury a modification as the Friendly Societies Bill did when referred to a select conmmittee-which Bill, by the by, reflected the greatest credit on the hon. member for Wiltshira (Mr. S. Estcourt). (Hear, hear.) Bven at the risk of shelving the BiU for the present session he would vote for its reference to a select committee, because he felt tb,t in a matter vwhich so much interested the working class s every care should be taken to legislate as perfectly and satisfactorily as possible. Mr. HBNLEY said the hon. member for Wilt.hire had omitted to show in any one particular how this Bill would remedy tho defects in the existing savings-banks. [Mr. S. Esteourt.-I alluded to the proposed Government security.) But-the hon. member had stated as emphaticaiy as possible that every effort which the Government might make to ascertain whethera savinos-bank was solvent or not would fail. And the hon. member gave the true ressou- namely, the impossibility of getting the books in. The bhn. member, who was, no doubt, well affeckd towards the Bill, eaid that it did no'. contain powers enouigh, and did not oo far enough; but the people who were to b- - ubjected to its operaion wereaxioustoknow whatwasthenatueoof the powers vhich the Governrent had alredy Asked for wvith reference to savciSe-bayks. By what means did they Droposetho ascertain o the solvency of a savings.bank? Tepubi had af rheght fto krnow on the faco of the Bill what thech relaonswed e a which the Government meant to i.n- ponel H e ould underAnd the view taken by the hon. gentlman he mmber for Wil1tshire that the Governmnent hul takegurt theoe suentirely into tbeirown hands and employ h eownle officershunder their own regulations, but that was a ve deent thing from coming down upon large institations of this kind with large staffs of their own, and imposing arbitrary regultions upon them without a word of notice. The Government and the managers of the national debt had had thi Matter under their consideration frthe last two or three 'Years, and must by this time have formed some soheme by which they intended to work this Bl.If that were so, that scheme ought to appear an the epof th Bll in order that it might be discussed by Pazliamenti ;and if they had formed no isheme he bad a right eto.assu, that they were merely trying an experiment wonch rndereda discussion doubly neceary. Colonel SYKeS drew the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the suggestions contained in the report of a cormittee of the trustbee of the Huddersfield Saving bank (as we understood). Tis reortpointed outthatthe last acouernts of the savings-banks oith urited kingdom, made up on the 20th of November, 1856, showed a deficiency to the amount of 5,201,4581. Es. 3d., and suggested that there should be an inquiry into this point. It t als suggestea that for the future depfosts should be em I ed solely for the benefit of savings-bank depositors, andepts as there wera about 30,010,0o0. . i of u p an deposits, ultm of thein at least should be in8veste inlanalea seufrities and mortgages, so that, instead of getting 2a per cent., they maight receive 4 per cent. The various suggestons contained in this report could better be discussed in a melet committee than in the whole Housee and he should therefore maove, when the order for going into committee was read, that the Bl be referred to a select committee. Sir Eh WILLOUGHBY fpro hended nothing but evl from the operation of the Bi as it at present stood. He thouy t the preamble was quite untrae. It aud that there had been consderable losse to the depositors, but the fact was that only eleven banks hd failed, in 10 of which Nte had beenx no loss to the depositorsh; for thetrstee a d manageyr had mnae up the defalcations by voluntary subsciiptions. In the case of Newport there had been a considerable defalcaton, but 17s. Sid. in the poundhbad beenultimatelypaid. Since the year817the whole defalcations had not amounted to more than one-eighth of a peony inthe apound. These los oertainly didonoth ustify the Iemnodelli ofttherwhol system. Ther hadobee oneserious case of loss--that of the Cuoe-stret Bank, In Dablin, but that arose entirely from the proceedings of the offioers of the National Debt office, who went on year after year registeing a defalcation, and alowed the hank to go on, knowing thAt it was not solvent. It was proposed that the Commisioners for the Reduction of theNational Debt should establishsavings-banks. Now. who were the comdissoners a Did they exist as a body? Why, they had loxugsince ceaed to existasan activecoommission, They never met now. If, as he suppo ead, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the commison why not put him into the bll co 7ssioni, and then you would come to the re state of the case? But ought the Chaneellor of the Exchequer to have the power of esublishing theae anLks throughout the whole kingdom wherever he pleased? uet the House consider the present oti of things. It was now avowed that 33n50000. of moteney -was fund which mhbt be jobbed by thoe Cancellor of the Exchequer, The srigt hon. gentleman did not conwal the fat At all. Surely, however, it was a monstrous proposition that the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his own sole wil and pleasure should buy and sel any amount of stock opexate at any time on the market with a view, as he said, to prevent injurious depression, and, in fact, become a regular stock-jobber. Ina the eight statutes which had paed on this subject there was no mention of the Chancelor of the Exchequer, and it never entered into the mind of the Leglature to hand over the administration of the fnda to tha official. He trusted that the House would be cautionts how it legislated upon this question. The depositors were alive to the principle involved, and many of the trustees and Aanagers would, he believed, immediately resign their offices if this Bill passed. These gentlemen knew what it wa to be troubled, and teased,' and pestred by officias from a department in London;~ they knew that the opeastion of the Bill would be disagreeable to them, and, perhaps, disastrous to the interests of the depoeitors. It was on these grounds that, wishing well to Savings-banks in this country, he enteated the House to take care lest they destroyed these institutions, for be realy beoived the there was serious danger of such a result if theyeassd, thig measure. He objected to the Bill, because it deat in oshamn names, and attachLed respnsibility to a body which had no real existence, instead of imposing it upon some one whose position was clearly defined and who could eaily be got at. Another objection was that the conditions for the regulation of these banks were not clearly laid down, the result of which would virtually be to intrust legisative power to subordinate officials. He would not, as he had intended, move that the Biube read a second time that day sixr onths, but he frusted some hon. member would move to refer the Bill to a select committee. Mr. GLYN was not one of those who thought it neessry to refer this Bill to a select committee. Speaking on behalf of the deposigtomr he maintained that the principle of the mneasue received the general sanction of that body of per sons, who were very anxious to xaceive the security of the Government. He agreed with the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Henley) in the difficulty of the qestion relative to trmust and managers, but the House w As bound to consider that the Chaiceho hof the Exchequer had shown every desire topmeet the requirements ofithose individuals. The right.hon. gentleman hadAlsosteatedhathe was willing tolay on sh table the regulations under which the savings banks -were to be conducted. Now, if the right hon. gentleman did that when the Bil was in committee every objection arising out of this point would be answered. At the same time he (Mr. Glyn) confessed that the Bill did not carry out all the obets which bethought ought to be catried out. In his opinion, the existence of a deficit of 5,000,0001., as shown in the acount connected with thes savpingsbanks, was positively disgraceful to the country. Thi question, however, was not necessarily mixed up with the resent , Bill; it must be considered by itself. e 1d not think the Treasurys hould be altogether tied down as to the amount of funds of this description left in ite hands, for they might be used advantageously for the mublie; but he thougt Parlament was to blame for the lxwyin which it had allowed the power given to the Treasury to be employed, He thought that the commissioners shouldl every year report the operations on which they had proceeded, and then it would be in the power of Parliament to impose, if it was necessary, a cheek. He approved the Bill before the House, and thought it would be for the interest of the country that no delay should take place in passing it into a law. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MAGUIRB said the Bill was generally approved in lreland, and he would give it his hearty support, though there might be some things in it which he would like to see amended in committee. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the object he had exclusively in view in proposing this Bil to the House was the interest of the depositors in savingsbanks. It had been well known for many years that the p resent state of the law on this subject was not satisfactory. Several Bills had iu successive years been brought under the consideration of the House, bat no one had hitherto been so successful as to obtain its assent. Nevertheless, it was an admitted fact that the state of the law was unsatisfactory; that the responsibility of managers and trustees for the deposits that t nce existed had ceased; that no other guarantee had been substituted for it, and that loss had in many cases accrued to depositors. In that state of things he felt it his duty to propose this measure to the House. (Hear, hear.) unquestionably be bad no thought of interfering with the legitimateinfluence of managers and trastees, or of diminishing those useful labours which they had for so many years exercised in their respective esSablishment4; but, for the purpose of guarding, not the interests of the Government, but the interests ot the Eachequer, he had felt it his duty to propose a certain control over the offlcers of these establishments. The power thus taken was embodied in the 3d and 4th sections of the Bil now before the House, and it had undergone revision with the view of reducing it to such an amount as should be sufficient for the protection of the country. The hon. member for the Tower Hamlets, who spoke at length agalust the Bill, raised up a man of straw wv hich it was not very difficult to demolisb. In the first place he stated that the Bill created offices under the absolute control of the Government - but if he referred to the clauses of the Bill he would find that the Government had not the power of ap. pointinganyof thelocalofflcersof savings-banks. That power was expressly reserved to managers and trustees, and the cnly oDucers the Government took the power to appoint were the auditors,who were not local officers at all. That was one essential mieconception aS to the intentions of this measure. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member further overlooked the fact that this was not a compulsory but a volantary measure, and that it did not interfere with any exsting bak k.(Hear, hear.) No existig bank tnat obected to the provisions of this lBll wvas bound in any way to come under its provisions, so that any bank now existing might, if it thought fit, continue as at present, without the slightest reference to the Government or the inspection of the Controller-General, even if the Bill should become law exactly as it now stood. (Hear, hear.) Much had been said of the financial part of the question, which was not necessarily involved in the measure before the House, and whatever objection might be made to the management of savings-banks money would equally apply if thbi Bill was not roposed. (Hear, hear.) Hie did not think it necessary at tnat hour to follow the hon. member through all the figures he had quoted. (Hear, hear ) He would only say that it this BiL became law be would be prepared on a future occasion to offer the fullest information on the sabject that could be desired, and to submit the whole of the management of the savings-banks money to the investigation of a select committee. (Hear, hear.) He wished to remark, however, that the chief part of the deficiency that appeared in the accounts of savings-banks had arisen from money credited to the banks, and not from the variations of securities made by successive Governments. He did not l-now how the hon. gentleman arrived at the conclasion that about 1,000,00uL had been lost bv variations in the securities, but according to his (the Chancellor of t]he Er. chequer's) calulations less than half the sum would be inearer the mark. (Hear, hear.) He wished to advert to one point alluded to by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxfordshire-viz., the conditions on which a bank would be admitted to the benefits of this Bill, as these were now defined. He did not apprehend tht auny further definition would be necessary; bat, with regard to the regulations contemplated by the second section, these related to a matter which represented the actual difficulties of this measure. The right hon. gentleman asked, first, whetber, if he had not matured such regulations, he was not proposing a measure blindly; and, in the second place, whether, if he had matured them, he was prepared to produce them to the YeAK-ty's Zud, if nt, 'wha 5tf5 arO being taken by HerMa. l2ty'js Govaruent for compluting the same.

Mr. SerjeaSut INGLAE said, it wasnot Isis intentionL to obstruct the progress of this meaure, the importance of which could not be exaggerated.. In its general complexioiL theoBill -was a good -one. The attention of'the country having been called for some tiinepast to the gross auls-andalous frauds connected with certai bankingcompanmes, the' House would no doubt be disposed toIreceive with. grt favour any measure directed to the! preve'tion of such. reprehensible transactions. There was, no dbubt, that many of the clauses of -the Bill . were directed to such frauds as had recently,' so much atounded. the: public mind, and those clauses hl4a his entire aproebtion. Biit oslo of the "clauses ofthe illde'lt,for t1i Srst time, with what were - caled ordins- leaches of trust, ziot suceh as miight i?e comnmitte by,b~iAkrs orpersons of that-description, but by ordintr usemutrawith;r6foenceto thle psanagement of' roperty.

Bat he (Hr. Setjeant Kinglakey doubted the ps-udence of the courso proposed by one of the clausesfor the repression of breaches of trust. The shade3 and differences of breaches-of trnst weresovariousthatit was inpossible to class them under any particular form. A. trusteb might without any fraudulent intent lend the money of his gcestuique trust, and bj the loss of thatmuoney-the' cestuiquc trust might be ruined. A trustee-migeht use the money of his castuique trust for his own benefiC. Tha was a wiful breach ot trust, althoughue loss might accrue to the'estate. If a loss did occur the trustee might ba obliged to make it 'good out of his own property. Be (Mr. Serieant Ringlake) Ehould be rather disinclined to make that a subject of criminal law. . Again a trustee might use the inohey of his ccstuique trust with 'an intent to defraud him. The 'objection, then, to the first section ofthis Bill was this-that it attacked fraud, aind fraud alone, but it did not attempt to interdicet'the act -which was the sourcoe of the fraud itself. Ought they not rather at once to apply the axe to the root by enacting that whenevtr' loss accrued through the wrongful act of a trustee, that lct, whatevfr might have been the intention of the trustee at the time-that it was done, should be held to be fraudulent? The firstclause' showved that those who drew up the Bill had notfaith iu it, because it was in these general terms:-" That every trustee who should either app'ropriate or use oreemploy money belonging to a castuiqse trust for his own-use, with intent to defraud, should be liable to an indictment for misdemeanour and to seven years' penal servitude..' Now, after a long experience in the criminal courts, he uniertook to say that it was impossible to define whit was an intent to defraud. 'If the fist clause were passed 'as it, stood, there. was not an honourable or sensitive man who would not at once give up his trusteeship. - A jury would have to b& appealed to in order to ascertain whether there h d been an. intent to defraud, and the character and liberty of every trustee in the country would thus be put ln an extreme jeopardy. If, then, the House meant to protect honest; trustees they ought to interdict the set which led to or permitted fraud and not to deal with case& of fraud alone. The 12th clause enacted that no prosecution under this Bill should be commenced without the eanction of one of Her Majesty's judges of the superior courts of law or equity or of the Attorney-GeneraL Against that clause he protested, as it was manifestly in direct opposition to the whole spirit of the English law. It was the office of the judge to act rather as the advocate than the prosecutor of a prisoner brought before Ihim for trial but it might be, if this Bil were passed as it stood tbat a Lustee might be arraigned for trial before; the very judge who had sanctioned his prosecution. If the hon. and learmed gentleman would consult thscommon la4- judges, he would find that the great mAjority cf them would be very much disinclined to-undertake theduty which he sought to impose upon them-a duty which. would render them liable to the suspicion that they had prejudged the case before they came into court. l nconcluion, he trustea that the Attorcey-General.would intro. ducu a clause into his Bill to inLterdict the sourco of fraud, and put an end to the facility with which trustees might now use the money of the cestuiquc trust, subject only to the interference of a court of equity. Mr. NEATE suggested to those hon. gentlemen who. were members of ihe Bank Committee whether it wouldt not be well to abolish that rule of the Bink by which theyrhfused tot nter into the consideration of'private trusts. Ia this ruse were relaxed, and regard were had to the fact oil whether stock was held in trust or otherwise, account3 would be placed on a sounder footing, and much would be done towards excluding the possibility of the alienation by trustes of the money of the cestuioye trust. MIr. X. I1OLT considered the measure in its present fornx open to such grave objections that, unless it underwentconsiderable alterations in commaittee, he sbould feel it his duty to oppose it at some future stage of its Vrogres. The Bill embraced several classes of offences-offenoes by trustees, by bankers, brokers, and other agents, and by directors of joint-stock companies. He should 'onI trobfle the House, however, with some observations, byway of illustrating his objections to the measure, in reference to that part of it which affected to deal with the' offenoes of tauttees. His objection to this part of the Bil was that it would infallibly tend to prevent gentlemen bf character, station, and responsibility from acosptingany office or duty connected with an important or complmcated trust (hear, hear); thut it would necessarily tend to throw those offices and duties upon persons of inferior responsibility awdRtation, or to place the administration of this property inthe hands of some legal tribunal or of some Government department - and which of these would be the worst he could not say. (Bear, hear.) The offence on the part of trustees provided, for by the Bill was, as ho understood it, this, -the appropniation of money or other property for his own benefit by, any person who was rightfully the owner of it at law, but who in jastico and in conscience held it for 'the benefit of some other person. Tho Bill did not attempt to impose a punishment for any breach of trust not coinmittod for the benefit of the trustee This was quite clear. But whOt would be the consequence even upon this clear construction of the act ? An attempt was made to define the wrougfnl act. This act was not only to be for the advantage of the person doing it, but it was also to be asain* good faith and with intent to defraud. Now, ho did tot euit agree with tho hon. and learned mernberfr forBocbserthr. &erjeant Kinglake) in his view of these words; but he oee. taizly thought they, woula either reduoo the act to & xiil. lity ew would be of no meaning and eÂ£ect at alL In isp consideration, if you proved that =oney goeig X unotber had been appropriated, you proved the intent to doiraud. If this vieow were not to hold good he knew not how the intent to defraud was to be proved, bcoause he ventured to say It was not in one caseout of 100 that you could establish by ovidence, over and above the commission of the act itself, that there was ann intent to defraud. Tho wrongful act was generally dono in the confident beUef that the next week or tho next year the trustee would be able to replace the funds confided to him ; and he apprehended the iotention of the Legislature was not that the crime should depend upon the result, and that the restorafion of the property should remove the offence. If a trustee, then, appro riated money to his own benefit, this would be an offenco wzhich under the Bill would subject him to seven years' penal servitude. Now, let the House consider the cases to which that would apply. He did not mean to represent that in those coses the parties were innocent; bat, 6hough they might have oommitted an offence, he thought the louse ahould hesitate before It decided to deal with them criminally. For his part, he should desire to draw a distinction between cases In which parties were intrusted with money and those in which they were intrusted with stock or chattels which might be converted into money. In the one case a trustee was guilty of criminal insolvency; in the other case he was guilty of a crime which resembled theft or forgery and should be punished accordingly. Now, he did not intend now to enter into the question whether the law at present aras of sufficient stringency in its bearing upon criminal insolvency, If, however, the offence they were dealing with-namely, that of having xooney confided to your possession end not performing the solemn obligation of paing it when it was due-if this odance belonged to orlinnalinsolvency, he objected to takeit out of that category and to deal with it by some exceptional law merely because of some recent instance which had produced a panic in connoxion with this subjet. naow submit one or two cass which would show the consequences of taking this particular class of offence out of the category of crime to which it properly belonged. He would suppose the case in which it was the duty of the trustee to receive money and when it amounted to a certain sum to invest it In a particular way. At the outset, talk and preach as they might to the contrary, the most innocent person woud place the money which he so received in small amounth to his own account at his own banker's; and there would be nothing criminal in that-it might be a breach of trust, an error, and if the banker failed he would be responsible, but there would be no criminality. The next step easily followed. The trustee wanted to draw upon his banker-he knew that if this money were not there his banker would accommodate him, but as it was there he drew upon that. It might be that that was not a criminal offence, but let them follow it a step further. The crustee took the money intending to replace it in a few days from secmrities which he had in his possession-the securities might fall in value, the man might fail, and he would become criminally insolvent. Now, how did that case differ from that of a man who, enged in commerce, enteredupon some speculation in which he knew that if he won the gain would be his own, and that if he lost the loss would be another's ? He would be criminally insolvent. So, if a. man incurred debts which he had no reasonable prospect of paying, he was criminally insolvent. Let tbat class of offence, then, be prope;ly defined, and he contended that the crime vwith wluch the Bill was intended to deal would come within the category of criminal insolvency. He would cite one more case which was of common occurrenCe, and it should be the last. A man in trade made his will, and directed that at his death his property should be realized for the benefit of the adult and infant members of his family. Death happened earlier than he expected; the elder branches of his family were the trustees, and the trusts of the will were that his assets should be realized, and should be divided as he had stated. The trustees knew that in the the-n state of the assets, if they were realized, there would only be a few hundred pounds for each of them, while by carrying on the trade for their mutual benefit much greater advantages would accrue. They might be told that if they did so they vould be guilty of a breach of trust, but nobody could say that they would be morally wrong, and the advice generally offered to them probably would be, .. If you ike to take the responsibility, do it." He (Mr. Xolt) was not sure that that would not fall within the category of crime as laid down in the Bill but, even suppose that it did not, what possibility would there be of per. suading sensitive and honourable men to undertake trusts of this desoription when there was any doubt in the matter, and when actmons perfectly innocent upon their part were liableto be locked upon as criminal. (Hear, hear.) It was vain for that House to endeavour to draw distinctions between offences whitch really belonged to the same class of -crime; they could not weigh the niceties of intent and of moral effect; the distincton was so fine that they could not do it; and if upon the occasion of any panic being created, or of some crime being comaitted characterized by more than usual enormity, they were called upon to pas some extraordinary measure of legslation to meet it, he sabmitted that that was not, to say the least of it, a Bsientific mode of dealing with the amendment of the law. (Hear, hear.) Let them clearly ascertain and define to what clamsof crime offences belonged; let them fix plainly the punishment for each class of crime - let their views be general and universal-not exceptiond-and they might hope to pass a law which would repress crime, and which would not defeat its own objects by undue stringency and severity. He thought that there were many parts of the Bill which might be made useful, but there were other portions to which he strougly objected, and he did not think that the provision which referred the matter to the Soli. citor or Attorney General or to any of the judges, would relieve the objeetions which he entertained to those particular potions. On the whole, the Bill, in his opinion requirethe most anxious and careful consideration, ana unleEs such objections as he had urged-which applied not only to trustees, but to bankers and agents also-could be remedied in committee, he feared that it would lead to some great scheme of a Government Trust Board. Perhaps the Board of Trade might be requested to undertake the whole subject (a laugh); or it might be referred to some legal tribunal, possibly; and he was satisfied that neither of those measures would be beneficial to the country, that neither would effectually repress crime, or would prevent persons from enjoying the fruits of their fraud with impunity. (Cheers.) The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that this was a Bill which required the most scrupulous and careful attention was no more than he had stated to the House when he obtained leave to bring it in, and that he should have the assistance of all sides of the House In the consideration of it he then expressed his confident hope; but he begged to point out to his hon. and learned friends that that a=sistance would be given in the most creditable and effective manner if they would only take the trouble to embody their objections, and to give expression to their doubts and difficulties by framing amendments on the Bill as it stood, and by the introduction of clauses which would be necessary in their judgment to give a more safe, cautious, and effectual operation to the measure. He confessed that he had been quite unable to attain to the meaning or to understand the purport of the arguments of his hon. and learned friend the member for Rochester. No doubt, his hon. and learned friend had favoured them with a good deal of eloquence, with many appeals on behalf of the judges, with much excellent advice, and with a pretty long sermon upon a text which v as no doubt familiar to all of them-namely, that prevention would be better than cure. (A. laugh.) The hon. aud learned serjeant had told them that they had much Utter " interdict the source of crime." What the meaning of those words was his stupidity had rendered him unable to ascertain. He did not know how to interdict that source of crime except by stopping altogether the relations between trustees and cestuique trusts. As long as those relations existed there would be that source of crime, and the only ,way in which he could interdict it would bo by doing that which would incur the pointed reprehension of his other Lon. and learned friend whose great difficulty and alarea was lest the Bil should interdict the source of crime which the hon. and learned serjeant was so exceedingly anxious to inte:diot. (" Hear, hear," and a lughter.) He might interdict the source of crime if he annihilated the office of trustee and subtituted for these private obligations the appointment of some general office or board to superintend all trusts and to take upon themselves the duties of trustees. Now undoubtedly, he should not desire that-he never should wish to see a Government board perform these obligations and duties of private life. (Hear, hear.) As long as there were guardians there must be trustees ; as long as a man who died committed to some friend or relative the charge and custody of his children and his property, so long there must of necessity exist that relation and that obligation; and he did not know, therefore, how he was to accomplish the object which the hon. and learned serjeant had inculcated; but if his hon. and learned friend would only do him the favour to try his hancd at legislation, and would embody that interdict of the source of crime in a palpable enactment, he should be most happy to consider such a measure, and if it should prove effectual he was sure that the House would be most grateful to him. (A laugh.) With respect to another point on which the hon and learned seijeant had dwelt-the extreme impropriety of the 12sh clause-and which he had approached with so much horror and alarm, he (the Attornev. eneral) had really imagined that that was the clause which would have rendered the Bill most acceptable to those gen- tlemen who were aDxios beyond measure that no enactment should pass which would interfere with the discharge of an ordinary relation of life; and unquestionably he had a gi-at number of precedents for the introduction of such an enactment. But for that clanso a disappointed ccatuique trust might go to a police court, and drag his trustee before the magistrate upon a charge perhaps which was totally unfounded, and he might expOse a sensitive, honourable, and respectable man to a public accusation of which at the nicment poesibly he might not have the materials about him to sbow the utter groundlessness. The consequence would be that there would be considerable danger lest sensitive and honourable men might be prevented from undertaking duties of this description. But one must not be deterred by the fear of difficulties from endeavouring to legislate ia order to put down great and grievous crimes, which, pasain npunished, were a reproach t.o our jurisdiction 'e did not Lnew, therefore, how to meet the difficulty except by placing upon one of the judges of the land, or on the Attorney-General the obligation of examining, first, what he would call the affidavit for a oriminal proceeding, in order to see that there was somethiDg like a reasonable ground for the charge. The House would remember in how many instances the Fanction of a judge, or alax offlcer, had afrst to be obtained sefore proceedings were taken. In introducing the Bill he drewparticularattention to this enactment, representing that the subject would require great consideration (hear, hear); and ho thought therefore that it would be as well to defer further obeervationg on it until the Bill went into comuittee. The hon. and learned member spoke of this BilU as something brought in on the spur of the moment and under the influence of recent events. In moving for leave to introduce the Bill he carefully guarded himself s&aiust the supposition that hewasactuated by such feelings. The absence of remedy in the cases to which the Bill re-

LONDON, WJUBSDAY, TUKE 9, 185T. The House of Lords last night was occupied with the case of Mr. SIHDDON, on whose behalf Lord GREYpresented a petition complaining that he had beeu iniquitously defrauded by relations t> whose care he had been confided as an infant oE his rights as a British subject and of the inheritance to which he was lawfally entitled. Lord GxBy entered at great length into the facts detailed in the petition, and concluded by moving that it be re ferred to a select committee. A very lengthened discussion followed, in which the LoRD CHANCRLLOR, Lords BnouoGu&r, St. LEo. WAR'SE SIjYDlRURsT, CAtPBaELL, ALBEMARLE, Lyr.. TELTON, RPESDmDE, and GRBY took part. Ultimately the motion was negatived on a dlvi. sion, the numbers being- For the motion.... 11. Against it ... ... ... 19 Majority ... ... -8 Intho House of Commons, the Oathls Bill was read a. second time without discussion or opposition. On the order for going into Committee of Supply, Lord GoDEnoIC called attention to the lust report of the Civil Service Commissioners, and to thl pre,eut system of admission to the civil berviS,
Yesterday, with the most economical typo- | graphy, our printers only just compressed into three columns the names of those who had the honour of attending HER MAJESTY'S Drawingroom on Saturday. One of these columns gave the names of the favoured few who were admitted to the Diplomatic and General Circles, and had the privilege of a special entrde; the second contained, in close print, the list of presentations; and the third an almost ilegible mass of nobility and gentry, yet by no means the whole of the company attracted by the occasion. We believe there were near two thousand altogether. With the greater part it was no matter of choice, but of etiquette, that is, of meral necessity, to attend; and the attendance was therefore as mnuch to be reckoned upon and prepared for as the attendance of the Commons at a caU of the House. Of these several hundreds had to be presented to Hui MAJrEsTY, and the rest had to pass before her with some degree of solemnity, not very mnch agitated or distressed, and, if possible, with their clothes on, in the short space of two hours. No doubt, this was a task which, if not absolutely difficult, yet might be done well or ill. It might not be quite so serious an affair as taking 50,000 men out of Hyde Park, yet it certainly was more of an operation than any ordinary review on that bloodless battlefield. We shaU not here move " the previous " question"' why so much should be huddled into one day, why there should now be only three or four Drawing-rooms in the season, and why not one every week, or as often as necessary. No doubt, the English like a crowd; they like to do things when everybody else is doing them; and, as they thus move by precisely the same law, they naturally find themselves attempting to occupy the same space and time, and having to fight for them. What we do ask is this, and we humbly put it to those whom it may happen to concern :-When two thousand ladies and gentlemen inDrawing-room dresses are quite certain to present themselves forthe honour and the right of admission to HXR AAJEsTr's presence within the space of two hours, when they must be admitted, and when all the conditions of the problem are known to every official of the Court, from the Gold Stick near the Throne to the policeman in St. James's-street, why are not preparations made accordingly, and why three times every year have we a repetition of the confusion, the surprises, and all but the calamities, that fell to the lot of our army in the C-rimea ? The public-that is the Duchesses, Marchionesses, Countesses, &c.-appear by this time to assume it for granted that HER MAJESTY can only be taken by storm. A large portion give it up altogether, partly because they feel themselves physically unequal to it, and partly because they do not like to give fifty guineas for a dress for the honour of appearing before the QUEEN in the tattered remains. The stronger and more adventurous get up early, dress early, and, under the directions of the police, fall into the rank, in Bond-street, or even Oxford. street, about noon, the Drawing-room beginning at 2, and there being no hope of achieving the great act of the day till between 3 and 4. When they eventually arrive at St. James's, and are at last put down, then begins a process often described, and not very unlike some of the more disastrous passages of the Crimean story. It is an affair of barricades and " pens," and the narrative of the sufferers as well as the philanthropic suggestions that pour in upon us remind one of the arrangements made for preventing accidents in the crowd at an execution. Indeel, we have seen overnight in the Old Bailey precisely the same combination of posts and rails, openings and gangways, as are found necessary against the rush of the British aristocracy at St. 'lames's. The uninitiated people of England, who hear of the " Drawing-room," of noble ladies in magnificent dresses, of which they can obtain the ininutest descriptions, and of HER MAJESTY'S Throne, surrounded by Ministers of State, Officers of the HEousehold, and all sorts of grand people, might naturally conclude that the company can move about and see one another with ease and composure. The fact is they are passed up to the Palace by the police, crowded into a " pen," and made to go through a series of rapid evolutions, till they find themselves once more in the same sort of durance, and have the pleasure of hearing their carriage called, often without the power of quittingo the spot on which they stand, unless they can either fly over the heads of the reeking crowd or creep under their feet. Fortunate indeed are they if they escape with no further damage than the loss of a few yarda of lace, a satin shoe, a flounce, or a handkerchief. "For" tunate," we say, because some lose their temper also; and not a f.w are several days recovering from the heat, pressure, and even violence of the struogle. Now, it is not our place to say what ought to be done, particularly when the sufferers are just the class that can take care of themselves, if they only choose to do so. Indeed, it would be rather ridiculous that we .hould be supposed capable of instructing Marchionesses and Countesses how to take sare of themselves. But we have an interest in the affair, if only because the scene is disgracefal to the national character; all the more so, because it is too like some other demonstrations of the national character. l?or the sake of that character, therefore, and for the sake of the many less important personages who must go to Drawingrooms, and cannot do much to mend matters, wo beg to offer a word or two for the consideration of HER ?WLVJE&Ty's advisers and the Officers of the Household. The nation has recently spent a very large sUDm in adding private apartments and reception-rooms of various kinds to Buckingham J Palace, in increasing the open space about the Palace, and improving the appraWheL ! Is it quite out of the question that they who have so readily granted the money' for these improvements should have some return ifor it in the use of the Palace for such occasions as that of last Saturday three or four ' times a-year. 'Unless we hear any real objec- tion, we must suippoae it only a matter of feeling, and hardly worth the enormous inconvenience of the present practice. But if there be some valid though unknown reason for keeping the thing at St. Jamesas, it surely would not cost very much to provide standing room for a few hundred more ladies and gentlemen, and preventing the necessity of treating them like sheep, or other less savoury animals, in a cattle-market. We have only to look to the Houses of Parliament, or even to the works now in progress in St. James's Park, for the proof of what we have often asserted-that the English public are always very ready with their money for a real and defensible purpose. Government has only to say that a new room, a new suite of rooms, or a rearrangement is wanted, and they will have the money without one word of complaint. But if they are not now prepared with any plan, at all events there is Buckingham Palace, which to all appearance is large enough, and has certainly cost money enough, for this purpose, and might be used for it till a better arrangement, if necessary, could be made.
According to the news from China by the mail which has just arrived, Sir MrcEAEL SavaYroun on one side, and the Mandarin YEH on the other, preserved their position of mutual observation. The trade with the Northern Ports went on as usual, except in so far as the successes of the rebels obstructed the operations in tea,-a fact to be regretted as affecting the comforts of our people at home, as wel as diminishing the public revenue. From fIongkong we learn that another attempt at murderhad taken place, and that the offenders were likely to be brought at once to justice. All else was stagnation. Just six months had elapsed from the time that the lorcha Arrow had been boarded by the myrmidons of YxH, and still the British Admiral lay at the mouth of the Canton River, waiting for reinforcements from home, and watching on the horizon for the little trails of smoke which should announce the arrival of the promised gunboats. The winter and spring had ended,-that is to say, the time for action had passed away, and the heats of summer were once more about to spread drowsiness over the fleet and colony. Nothing was active but the deadly hatred of the Southern Chinese towards the " barbarians" -who threatened their coasts. If the accounts received be true, the authorities of the Canton province are still in their dream of exterm:nnation. The destruction of Victoria, the seizure of our steamers, and the decapitation of our people were stMi contemplated by "the gentry" of San-on, the district opposite Canton. Led on by literary Mandarins, who have taken high honours, the people of this part of the country are continually meditating the surprise and capture of any unfortunate vessel which chance may drive within their reach. We may expect to hear of one or two murders and one or two executions within the next few weeks, the arrival of steam sloops and gunboats will be announced, and the usual details of heat and fever will be given. But Hongkong will remain in its present state of sleepy restlessness until the London world has been dispersed to all the corners of Europe and has begun to assemble amid the fog and sleet of November. In short, there is no likelihood of any important movement until the hot weather of 8567 has passed away. About the first anniversary of the Canton bombardment an immense armament will have assembled in the harbour of Hlongkong. The British and French and American Commissioners will have been at their posts long before, but these dignified personages will have had to pas a period of compulsory leisure, which they may devote to framing their list of demands or their several plans of procedure. We shal, during the next two or three months, hear now and then of our vessels at Cape Verde, at St. Helena, at the Cape, at Point de GaUe, and, one by one, some in good condition, some broken-down or leaky, they will make their way into the presence of the Admiral commanding. By August a fine fleet will be under the orders of Sir M. SzYmouR. Another month will be sufficient to repair damages and make all straight for immediate operations. About that time, too, the less pretentious but not less useful craft will slowly come to anchor in the Canton River-all the shot and shell, and clothing and medicines in their numbered transports, will come to hand, after pitching and rolling about on the ocean for some four or five months. A great first-rate, which a few years since would have taken its place in an experimental squadron, will now descend to the rank of a hospital-ship, and its huge bulk will be moored in somo convenient spot as soon as it makes its appearance after such a voyage as its shape and weight will permit it to achieve. Then the fleet will be reported ready. But, though Cninese may not be very formidable enemies, and bluejackets, armed with cutlasses and pistols, are likely to be a match for any warriors they may meet on shore, yet even COpT=s or CLivB would hardly think of invading the Celestial Empire with-ships' crews only. The troops from England must be in readiness, and this readiness will depend on the performances of the Transit, the Urgent, the Assistance, and similar ironically named craft. Let us hope that the delay enforced by the heats of summer may be sufficient for even these, and that by the time the steamers and ammunition are ready, and the Commissioner, the Admiral, and the General are anxious to begin, we may have our 5,000 or 6,000 Englishmen, in addition to a good muster of Asiaties, safely encamped in the neighbourhood of Canton. Though events may not keep pace vith public impatience, and though the first news of the coming operations may fall on the ears of a public which has begun to tire of the subject, and a Parliament which is in the agonies of a new Reform Bill, yet it cannot be doubted that when all is ready success, immediate, complete, and lasting, may be gained. But, whether we fight Russians or Cninese, there is equal need of resolution and promptness. We do not speak of that mere readiness for battle which every soldier possesses, but of the vigour of will and the bold acceptance of responsibility which are among the highest merits of a commander. Now, in China we have three chiefs, the Admiral and General are independent of each other, and we presume neither considers himself bound to obey in a military question the behests of the Commissioner. In these cases the difficulty of entire agreement may be considered to vary almost as the squares of the number of individuals concerned, and we cannot help feeling that the three authorities may fall into tne same error of mutual expectation which has rendered famous the joint command of the Earl of CEATHAM and Sir RIcUAsm STRACHAN. It is therefore not unreasonable to ask that they will, in conjunction with the Home Government, improve the next, few months in determining on a plan of operations which may be carried out without hesitation or delay. Lord ELIwn and the commanders should i%Qw x hat they arc to do by the tinar, that the season and the arrival of reinforcements give thena liberty of action. -It seems, certainly, that the best plan would be to punish a local outrage by local retribution. The Northern Porta are trading with us, we are taking more tea than ever; we took immense quautities of silk last year, and, from the state of the European cunture, we are likely to require a still larger quantity. It cannot be a good policy to bombard Shanghai and Foo chow-foo, which know little and apparently care nothing about the quarrel at Canton. Furthermore, in a general war with the Chinese Empire we do not know with whom we are fighting. The EMPEBOR is to us almost as mythical a being as PP.STER JOHN. What his authority is, how far he has s3nctioned the insolence of yEu, and how far he can prevent it, are matters on which we can form no judgment. We do not even know whether at this moment he wears his crown in security. The rebels occupy vast provinces in the very heart of the empire. We learn that they are making head in the neighbourhood of Foo-chow-foo, and that the first crop of teas in certain districts would be lost because money could not be safely transmitted for purchase. The whole fabric of Chinese rule may even now be crumbling to ruin. It seems therefore a sensible policy for England to abstain for the present from any organized invasion of the empire. But her resolution aud severity may be well shown by the capture of Canton, the expulsiohi of the offending governor, and the oecupation of such points on the coast as may prove to the enemy that their country lies at our mercy. Should events require it, another campaign may carry our standards to the inland cities of the empire.
The petition which Earl GREY presented last night to the House of Lords involves a story so strange, and a case in many respects so remarkable, that we endeavour to condense the facts into some manageable shape for the information of our readers. It is true enough that the subject is not a new one-indeed, its history is one of its most singular features; but it has, perhaps, never yet found its way to the general knowledge of the public. In the year 1764 or thereabouts-so far must we ascend the stream of events for the beginning of the narrative-Mr. WnmAr SnmDDON, only son of a Scotch landowner, left his native country for America; fouryears afterwards he returnedon avisit, bat sailed again in 1769, and remained beyond seas, engaged in mercantile pursuits, for the rest of his life. While in America he was twice marriedfirst in 1785, of which marriage there was female issue only, and again some few years later, with the issue of a son. It is upon this second connexion that so much has been found to turn. It appears that the union in question was solemnized in the first instance, in 1790, by civil contracta ceremony alleged to impart the validity of marriage according to the laws of New York, where it was performed. Either, however, to remove doubts, or to make assurance still more certain, or to facilitate the succession of his son, Mr. SHDDoN, six days before his death, which happened on the 13th of November, 1798, was married over again to the lady with whom he had been eight years living, and this time according to the rites of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Most of our readers will be aware, no doubt, that by the law of Scotland a marriage between two persons legitimates al the p,eoios issue, so that if this second ceremony had been performed in Scotland no uncertainty whatever could afterwards have attached to the rights of the son as his father's heir. Closely connected with the SaDDoNs in Scotland was a family named PATRIcK, and Mr. WILIA PATRICo was appointed guardian of YOUng S}IDDON upon his father's death. After the news of that event reached Scotland proceedings were taken upon the assumption that the son born in America was not entitled to succeed his father in the possession of the Scotch estate, and the succession -was opened in due form to Dr. RoBEnRT PATRICK as next heir. This was in 1799. In the year following WrLuiA PATaICK RAISTOx SEEDDON, the son aforesaid, arrived in Scotland from America, and passed under the tutelage and care of Mr. WnLuaI PATRIcK. In 1801 the guardianship of the boy was transferred from WLLIA}r PATRICK to HUGH CRAUFURD, and two years later this RUGH CRAuvu.&D instituted an action against the PATRICKS for the recovery of the lands to the use of his young ward. The action was defeated, and an appeal to the HIouso of Lords met with no better success, an adverse judgment having been pronounced by Lord ELDoN himself in 1808. Here, then, is the case of " SEDDoN V. " PATrIcK " apparently decided in a Court of the last resort all but half a century ago, and yet this in substance is the very question stiU agitated between the identical parties which Lord GREY introduced to their Lordships last night. Not only is WmuLiT PATRICR RASToN SSBmDDoN stiU sustaining in his proper person the character of petitioner, but Mr. WVILLiAx PATRICK himself is living still, and still in possession of the contested estate. A more marvellous longevity of procedure has seldom been seen, and the intervening features of the case are equaUy striking. Mr. W. P. R. SHEDDON was duly sent to school and college under the superintendence of Mr. W. PA.TRICK, after which he entered the Royal Navy, remained in that service till the close of the war, then went to India, and finally returned, in the possession of considerable property, about 1833. Shortly afterwards he appears to have conceived a suspicion that he had been wrongly dealt with in respect of his legitimacy and his rights of patrimonial succession, and at length, in 1849, he reopened by personal action in the Scotch courts those very proceedings which had been terminaLed in the House of Lords some 40 years before. To these proceedings the PATRiCKS pleaded the bar of the previous decisions, and this defence was sustained, though not altogether to the exclusion of discussion on the merits of the case itself. Again was the cause carried to the House of Lords on a second appeal, and again, in 1854, decided against the petitioner. In reality, according to thec doctrines of English law, the original sentence of the Courts could not have been upset except upon proof of such fraud or collusion as would vitiate the entire proceedings. Whether the decision of 1803-1808 had been a just one or not imported little, so long as it had been given in a bond flde suit. To all intents and purposes it was, even if unjust, nevertheless final, unless it could be shown that the suit was a fraudulent suit altogether. The plaintiff, in fact, did employ this plea, but without sustaining it, and his case therefore waa lost. Now, however, comes a most extraordinary feature in the case. The questions of legitimacy and alienage appear to have been argued on the supposition that the claims of the petitioner were founded on the last marriage alone, and the controverted points turned mainly on the domicile of WILLAM SHEDDON, the elder, at the time this last marriage was solemnized. If he could be consEdered a Scotchman, his previous issue was beyond doubt legitimated; but was he a Scotchman after 28 year' residenee in America? It was rukd otherwise; and, as no account was taken of the original civil marriage, from which the petitioner sprang, the dccision was fatal. As early, however, a 1852 the petitioner had corifnenced the consiructjon of a claim based upon the validity QÂ£ this prior contract, and at last, after the dpiniou against him in 1864w he repaired t3 New York, and instituted pk:ceedings forthe establishment of his legitimacy-,in the place of his bittit l And here, at length, after so many strDgBle, he1 was successful, for 2 nan action brought in the Supreme Court of Ne.W' York it was decided that the first marriage of 'WILTrAm SHEDDON Witlh tlie mother of the petitioner was a valid marriage, and the petitioner, as the issub of such mnarriags and lawfal heir of his father, seenj' actually to hare recovered a piece of land. It is impossible not to mympathize with struggles and fortunes like these. Into the trials of 1803 and 3852 we hav-e no desire tc, entes, though we think amrselves bound in justice to observe that the Judger before whom the case came for hearing expressed themselves very decidedly against the allegations of fraud which had been advanced. Omitting, however, these considerations, andcpsPsing over, as the petitioner himself now appears to do, the claim to the estate, it does appear a hardship that a man whose legitimacy-assuming, of course, that the New York judgment is unimpeachable-has been established in the actual place of his birth should be deprived of his status by such events as we have related. If he was neither an alien nor illegitimate he was entitled to succeed to the patrimony of his family at the death of his father, nearly 60 years ago. The law of which in this case he would be the victim in the loss of the estate is so obviously 'beneficial that no exception can be taken to its occasional operation for wrong. Better even that examples of such hardship should occur now and then than that the settlements of years should be interminably liable to disturbance. Bat the legitimacy of the petitioner is a question apart, and if this point has been really and completely decided by the New York trial, it undoubtedly seems hard that a previous decision, arrived at,it is true, after careful investigation,-but with imperfect knowledge of facts, should be suffered to affect him without remedy on a pointwhere such strong and such laudable feelings would naturaly be entertained. The House of Lords decided in 1808-doubtless with correct judgment as to the law then consideredthat the petitioner, as the issue of a marriage contracted after his birth, had not been legitimated. But, as Lord GREY stated last night, he now comes forward and represents that there was a marriage of his parents prior-to his birth, and that it has been held valid, and himself legitimate, in the place where it was solemnized. This certainly appears a case for sympathy, and we should hope for eventual redress, notwithstanding the difficulties which induced the Lords to refuse a Committee upon the subject.

H [ MATEST7Y'S DIAWIVGNVOkt. * TO THE DITO ;OF THE TIME - Sir,-The interest you take in the social Coh&o2t of this great country and the kinduem with wkiM y6U hate received my former communication es the subject before us induoe me again to give you a brief account of the proceedings at the late draw-' Ing-room on Shturday. fOwing to several circumstances there had beem no draiing.room this year; consequently the oompany was very great; but, thanks to the foresight, t;,e consideration, and the graeeful courwty of the Lo:d Cbamberlb and his stff, the " non-arrnge. menrO were perfect. The confusion, the pressure, the he.t, and the distress are indescribable, exoeptr by-the graphic pen of your Crimean correspondent.. But bwddes the pressure, the heat, and the di.- tress an &musement *f& very national character bad been pr,ovided. To protect the approcwlr to t'he celebrated Pen his lordship 'had cunrAugly constuted of ok benches, by the advice of Todtlel6ew, a sort of oetwork; this at first was regwded1wi*t some are a respect, but as the preswe in. the rear bee w greater some Lady more advsnturous. than the rest actually cleared the outside fenoe ; )er example' was soon followed, the Irislwomen taking the' lead, and clearing the fences wiRh tbat peculiar tact. for which their country horseware 8o celebrated. The Marchioness of D., the Ctuntem of L, mF Lady E., were, seen going over in first-rate tylIe, but an unfortunate English girl, Mis-F. 0C L.,pnotso well educated, having scrambled on tb the top oÂ£ the bank, was drawing i;reath previous to the- fusaL spring, when suddenly her progress arrested by one of the hehmeted veterans crying put atheop of his voice, "HEallo, madame; the odi Ch)erlain desires the ladies will not leap over the: fences t" The por girl fell back into her father5i arms, aim old soldier, who briefly but not very courteously roplied, in a deep gutturaltone, " The Lord Ohamberlain be -" to which doom I fancied that I heard; several sweet and gentlo voices whisper, " AmenAP To superintend the Court arrangements of the. richest and greatest Sovereign on the earth thiis aai Lord Chamberlain and his staff are paid some 5;,O0.. or 6,0001. a-year. But his Lordship will say, 'What can I do more r The rooms will only receive 1,000, and I manage tot put in 2,000! Do you give me no credit for that arrangement? Now, Sir, pray allow me, through your valuabla columns, to sggest to the Iord High Chamberlain how Her Majesty's company might be receive& without confusion, without pressure, without heat, and without distress. The plan is so simple I am almost ashamed to write it on paper. The Pen, the well-known Pen, contains about 75 persons; the room of which it is a portion is a fine large room, which if divided by a barrier would& contain two more sets of 75 persons each. The room next to the large room would also contain 75 persons, and the anteroom to that 75 more. Place bars to each of these divisions, and we hav& five divisions capable of receiving 75 persons each in great comfort and security, making an aggregate of 375 persons. When these rooms are thus suppiled let the ofircial in the last room (No. 4) make a signal to the company, who will then prevent any more persons being set down till another signal is made that there is room for; tosit in one's carnage in a perfect paradise to baing put in the LordChanaberlain'8 press. Now, let us return to the Pen. When the door of the reception room is opened let all who are in the Pen pass through, but the door of the Pen must on no account be opened till the whole 75 in the Pea have passed out of it. When it is perfectly empty then allow the 75 in No. 1 room to pass in, giving them to understand that they will at be allowed to pass in at once, this knowledge will at once remove all desire to press forward. When No. 1 is empty open the bar and allow the. 75 of No. 2 room to advance in the same way. When No. 2 is emptied alow the 75 of No. 3 to advance. When No. 3 is empty allow the 75 of No. 4 room to coma forward, and then signalize to the porter to allow 75 more to set down and take possession of No. 4 room. In this way, by attendmg to the simple rule of not putting more in each room than the Pen will hold and emptying each division completely before a new set is admitted 10,000 persons would pass through in a few hours without confusion or grief. Now a word for the departure. At present there are but two exits; others might easily be obtained. For instance, there is a capital approaoh through the clock-tower arch, which would greatly relieve the pressure at going away. And now, Sir, commending the Lord Chamberlaixt and his staff to your especial consideration, and the sufferings of your countrywomen to your tender sympathies, I bid you adieu, And remain, Sir, your obedient servant. -E. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Without a hope that this will meet the eye of Royalty, I wish, in the namae of many of my countrywomen, to state the reasons which will prevent us, loyal English ladies, from paying our annual respects to our beloved and honoured Sovereign. They are simply these-dread of being penned, squeezed, crushed, like panting cattle under a hot June sun,-many of us who are ill able to hear fatigne obliged to stand for hours, envying the fortunate friend who provided herself with a campstool, dread of having our dresses spoiled, our point-lace torn to shreds, our very hair puUed and disordered in a manver little befitting the dignity of a plunmed bead, and ourselves with exhausted bodies and irritated minds, after the unseemly scuffle at "H Her Majesty's Drawing-room ! " A few years ago, the graphio pen of " Verbena" represented these evils, and some slight relief was obtained. But the numbers claiming the right to make their obeisance to their Queen have increased without any adequate arrangements having been made for their reception. Would any Lady in London or Paris subject her friends, or expect them to subject themselves, to such annoyance, nay,bodily perilp, as are undergone by Hler Majesty's female lieges ? Do not our ladics, at least those whose houses are worth frequenting, so arrange their receptions that their guests should have room to breathe in, move in, and, above all, seats to repose on for a few minute ? Is there any other Court in Europe, from thegrandest to the mostinsignificant. where ladies, whose station entities them to be rceived at all, are thus pushed, poked, battered-milder language will not convey an idea of the treatment we receive-and incessantly ordered to "Move on" if caught resting our wreary backs against a waU ? That our Gracious Mistress id not aware of the sufferings of her female subjects on these occasions we are perfectly oonvinced. That these evils would speedily be remedied were thosa whose duty it is to suggest a remedy not exempted froum them we are equally certain. Perhaps some Court functionary on reading these groans of a nearly demolished sufferer will say, " Lot the grnmblers stay away; there aret plenty who wiU always attend the Drawing-rooms." Most true, ladies who enjoy seeing their names and dresses reoorded in print, mothers anxious for invitations to CourL balls,-these classes will not be deterred by a large amount of bodily danger aud suffering; but there is a large class of English wom^en indifferent to, and indepWendent of, suck bribes as those just mentioned, and whose birth aud pesitiema in sosiety ara capahie of redecting honour even on a Royal Drawing-room, and it is in the name of these loyal-he ladies thatI make this appeal to the public sense of Â±ustice. I remain, Sir, yours obediently. VZtMl]!;A TJIi SOECON- dlue a.

INDIA AND CHINA. [The following appeaed in our second edition of yes. t r&y:-] By the arrival of the overland mail we have received our private correspondence and papers from Bombay to the 11th of May; Calcatta, the 2d of May; and Hongkong, the 26th of. ApriL The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent: "BOMBAY, WAY it. " It is but 10 days since I last wrote to you, this mail, as is customary, leaving five days earlier than the ordinary date by reason of the approaching monsoon. I have nothing of any moment to communicate. Peacoe, or the armistice that precedes it, has tied the hands of the army in Persia, and somnolent tranquillity, characteristic of this hot season, broods over India. More than one vessel has arrived from the Gulf since the lst, but they have brought us little save the growls of the troops at the prospect of an inactive hot season at Bushire or Mohammerah. Some portion of the force, such as the 14th Dragoons, will be sent down before the monsoon. Detachments of the 14th have, indeed, already arrived, two of which have marched up to Kirkee, which station, what with the returning regiment and the wing of the 12th Lancers, which relieved them, promisew to be inconveniently crowded. But the 12th must remain there now till the rains have come and gone. To send them by land to Bangalore would be to expose them first to the risk of cholera, and then to that of damp and dysentery, while sailing to any of the southern ports, such as Mangalore or Cannonore, is dailyassuming more and more of impracticability as tbe monsoon marches up the coast from the vast waters in the south-west. The great majority of the force, however, will certainly remain in the position it has taken and fortified for some months to come. Three months at least are, it is understood, to elapse from the ratification of the treaty before Bushire and Mohammerah will be evacuated. The former place is, and will continue to be, occupied by the First, the latter by the Second Division. Peace thus finally arranged, Mr. Murray returns to Teheran, escorted perhaps by the 1st Scinde Horse, which noble corps report even sends as far as Herat, that it may asctain as a fact that the disputed frontier city is abandoned by its Persian conquerors, and restored to the family of Yar Mahomed. Hitherto the general health of the troops has been good. Very few officers or men have been sent down here sick. As, however, the heat increases, the amount of illness will also increase; and we may yet lose many valuable men before the last of the transports anchors again in the hbabour of Bombay. " As I write there arrives from Meerut, in the North-West Provinces, or rather from Agra, a telegraphic message containing intelligence which rather mars that profound tranquility to which I have alluded as pervading the whole of India. It runs thus:-" The 3d (Bengal) Cavalry are in open mutiny. They have burnt down the lines and the officers' bungalows. Several officers and men are killed and wounded." This, if true, is startling news indeed. We may hope that it is exaggerated, but that it has a foundation at least of truth can hardlybe doubted. In traversingthe country from Meerut to the telegraph station at Agra the extent and violence of the outbreak may have become unduly magnified, but the state of feeling in the regiment for some little time past renders it only too likely that an outbreak has really taken place. The aversion expressed by the Sepoys of Barrackpore to the greased cartridges had extended to, and been sbared by, their brethren at Meerut. The disbanding of that regiment, and the ignominious execution of one of the native officers of another, might, one would think, have shown to the army at large how their rulers deal with mutiny, and deterred them from following out completely the example set at Barrackpore. Such was the hope entertained by the offlicers at Meerut. A court of inquiry was held at the station on the 25th of April, under the presidency of Major Harrison, the Deputy JudgeAdvocate, to investigate the conduct of one of the regiments quartered there in respect to the newly issued cartridges. This regiment was the 3d Cavalry. The men who were examined stated, we are told, that they could discern nothing impure in the eomposition or glazing of the paper, but that they had heard it was unclean, and believed it to be so. Further, they expressed contrition for their disobedience in ref using,to make use of the cartridges, and their readiness to use them when called on to do so again. The next we hear of this supposed repentant regiment is that it is in open mutiny. By the next mail I shall have, I hope, further details of this unfortunate event. At present I can only add that the European troops at the station are the Carabineers, a battalion of the 60th Rifles, and a troop of horse artiUery. " A Madras paper has announced the death Of the Nizam. It appears, however, that the Prince though very ill, was alive on the Ist inst. Telegraphic meEsages have been reeeived from Eyderabad down to the 8th, which make no mention of the death of the Sovereign. " General Ashburnham, with his staff, arrived on the 4th, and leaves for China about the end of the week. " In the features of the import and export trade there have been no changes of note during the last ten days. The Five per Cent. Loan is being fast paid up. Freights have slightly fallen. Exchange on London, 2s. lid." CUU,INA. (FROM o011 OWVN COPnEONDEBI.) ONGKONG, AnirIL 26. The mail of the 10th of March from London is still out., The steamer Cadiz is to be despatched to-day at 9 a.m. with the outward mals, which it is expect& d will meet the semi-monthly Calcutta steamer at Galle. The Peninsular and Oriental Company now despateh a steamer from this port five days after the arrival of each mail, calling at all the ports on the way to Shanghai, and another steamer. taking the Shanghai mails, leaves about the same time. The Shanghai community have addressed Admiral Seymour regarding this delay in receiving their letters. At present private steamers frequently anticipate the mail steamers' advices. This was felt to be such an inconvenience that arrangements were entered into to charter a steamer -which should leave this port a few hours after the letters were delivered here. The steamer that was taken up for the purpose, however, has been lost. I regret to say that the report mentioned i my letter of the 15th inst. of the accident to Her MIsjesty's ship Raleigh turned out to be correct. On the 14th inst., at about 1 p.m., when near the island of Chook-chow, about five or six miles southeast of Maca, the vessel struck on a sunken rock, and sustained such serious injury that it was necessary to run her ashore, which was accordingly done on the east side of Ko-ho Island. The v( sel is in a precarious situation, and hm3 sunk considerably in the mud. The water Is up to her upper deck. The rock the Raleigh struck on is said not to have been marked on the English charts. Previous to the vessel being run ashore a signal of distress ras fired, and then a salute to the French Admiral on board the Virginie , which war in sight. The French steamer Catinat was at once despatched to-render asstncceand brought over the report of the accident to Admniral Seymour. - - The hulk Alligator has been sent for the accommodation of the crew of the Raleigh. Her Majesty's ship Nanldin is also offthe place where the Raleigh is. The Chinese Coolie who is supposed to have so barbarously murdered Mr. C. Mark-wick has been captured, and is now in custody awaiting his trial. In consequence of some disclosures made by him an expedition was sent to Stanley, and one also to Cowloon, to try and capture some of Yeh's emis. saries, who are said to be about. The expeditions were not successful, although it was understood that such parties had been at those places. From the Canton river we have dates to the 22d inst. There was no occurrence of importance to notice. The steamer Charles Forbes, Lieutenant Curme in charge, and with Captain the Hon. Reith Stewart, of Her Majesty's ship Nankin, on board, had been up the creeks some 50 or 60 miles, and was not opposed in any way. At Canton we hear that great discontent prevails owing to the existing state of affairs and Yeh's inability to adopt any energetic measures against the British. Of the rebels we hear nothing. From Foo-chow-foo advicea to the 18th - inst. are very unsatisfactory. The rebels were again making head in the districts' In that neighbourhood, and1 large amounts of money intended for operations in tea ilf the Kishow and otherdisirict.had to be, brought baclk. The first crop of Kiahow teas would be lost; ax4 it is quite impossible to say when any new teas, beyond those collected in the immediate neighbourhood, are likely to be available for export. Shanghai dates to the 20th inst. repoit that thetown of Hokow, 'in the :Eeangree province.- had been taken possession of by the rebelx. At Hongkong all remains quiet. In trade little has been done,for the Ia3t 10 days. The long drought is said to have affected the firstl crop of Canton silk, which will be a 'hort one\, Cotton is quoted $9J to $nl for Bengal and Bombay. -- Cotton Yarn.-Nos. 28 to 32, $34 to $35; Non 38 to 42, $42 to $44. r - Longcloths.-Grays, Oi catties, $2 5c. to $2 10c., whites, 54 reed, $2; 64 reed, $2 40c.: no sales.'

Freights have improved, and veselis are wanted to load sugar to Great Britain at 41. to 41; 5s., and 10s. extra to the continent. Ships are also stil required for emigrants and to load rice. Amoy advices are to the 20th istant. The transactions in imports had been small, the markets being affected by the disorganized -state of the country and the high price of rice. At Foo-chow-foo letters to the 18th instant do nxot report any transactions in imports or exports. The dealers held the stook of tea for an advance on the already high prices ruling there. A. mentioned, the rebels being in the tea districts, had prevented the picking of the first crop of EishoW congous, and the second and third crops would be affeoted by this. It is quite uncertain when the first cargo of new teas may be expected to leave. Shanghai advices to the 20th inst. report considerable trasactions in gray ehirtings: 6i cattiew, 1-6-8 taels; 6-10 catties, 1-7 taels. There was no inquiry for whites. In tea two chops of Congou had been settled at 15i to 17 taels, and of greens about 9,000 packagcs, at former rates. The total export of tea to Great Britain from the Ist of July, 1856 to the end of April, 1857, it is estimated will be about 58,000,0001b. against 80,000,OOOlb. to the same time the previous year, being a deficiency of 22,000,00olb.

The coal proprietors of this district have lately been giving their attention to plans which are being matured for exlendipg their trade to Liverpool by sending their coal to that market for expert (which has already sambech benefited the neigh. (ourbood of Wigan, Bolton, St. Helen's, and North Wales), ande,ith that view they have already held meetings at LPvtrl and Manchester, and have decided In lfutue to hold their meetings quarterly at the latter place, that be'm considered the meet central for the SouthiYorkshieoaT proprietors and the LiverSi ol m h .eot is annto, Tewesbur ,pootuss Wrnebto The re#tosul that South Yorkshire coal is already export from Garston on the Mersey, and from the varions trials that have feei. nade it gives great sAtisfaction, The spacw taken up itn vessels by some kinds of coal whior eobtainod fromNorth Wales and LAnca-shire is so considerable as to render thera ye objectionable for the use of steam-packets compared the the South Yorkshire seam coal, the heating properties of which are concentrated in so much less apacea, and there is every probabili that it wl smpersede much of the coal hitherto used n that market. The coalownere have also in conten'plation the exportation of the celebrated Silkrstone and Flockton coAl which is so mnuch liked. The prospiects of the South Yorlshire district are most encouraging, not merely from the opening up of new mIarkets, but from the fact that there are littlo or no stocks at present on hand-a circumstance which Is veay unusual at this season of the -wear.

It has not, indeed, as yet, hoisted the red flag on the Palab of Marie de Medicis, eatablished intrenchments in' the gardens of the Luxembourgo sung in chorus the MAarseillaise or the Ca; ira, or figured in the Car7nagnole, b4t it persists in its measure for a reform of the mode of. procedure towards its membeis. The original daeiand about Senatora being made amenable 'obl to their :own Chambers, and not to. the ordinary ouits, civil or military, is, I believe, abandoned. This would identify them . too much -with. the. old Chamber of Peers, and is decidedly opposed to the wishes of the Emperor, who will not hear of any political body combining legislative aid judicial' functions, and whose fueling towards Chamberis of jPeers generally, since 1840, is -not very afectionate. On that point, therefore,no c6noessionwillprobably be made. What the Senate now waut% is, that it shall be established that. none of its members. hall .be proceeded against -.ithout its own peimission; and, from the astonishing energy ofits pemistence, it' is not improbable that, so far, it will gain its point.

Gj)riainie do Cassagnac has just' published a work in twvo volumes, entitled, fsistory of tfie Ball of 'Louis Philippe, of the Republic of 1848, and of the Re-establishmneit of the Empire, comprising a period of eight year. The author has been known for a long time .past among the-leading writers in the periodical press inFrance. His articles in the Coitstitutionn4during the fierce strugg,les between the ultra-revolutionary factions'and the party of order during the Republic wfere-marked by a vigour and energy of language truly remarkable. T.he present wrork 'is an interesting narrative of the stirring events vhich occurred from the great banquet movement in favour of reformn which led to the overthrowr of the Orleans dynasty to the establishment of the Imperial Government. HRi, account of the events w'hich immediatelypreceded the overthrowv of the Republic and of the circumstance' vwhich accompanied it is very interesting and gra phic. 'It is hardly necessary to say that M. do Cas asguac is, or at least professes to be, an admirer o,' the Imperial regime, anId that he justifies the means by -which it wTas founded. "Public opiniion in France and Throughout Europe," he says,- "Mint naturally have been influenced by the apprechtions which parties who were interested in leading it. astray have eirculated on the great events Of the last ten yeara Independently Of the passions which generelly prevent the vanquished from admitting their defeat, the ardent amnbitioa of doctrines andof systems always3 conceala fr.om the presen the disasteSs which endanger the future. It is, then, natu ra1 that the Parliamentary r6gime of 1830 does not explain it4 fall by its rivalries4 and its turbulence; the srtime o' February by the incapacity of its men and the sterility of their ideas; the maistakcen agitators Of the Legislatlte A;sembly by the popular vrehemencewbhich bore the heir of the First Coesul to the3 restored throne of the Empire; ani many may have be]ieved that thesre had been for ten years incapacit y in reverses and address in success. It is in the interest of truth, of morality, and of policy to disengagethe grave events v hich have occurred before our eyes from the vain theories based only upon chance, and to exhibit, w,th the aid of impartial history, all that there wvas of simple and conformable to the very nature of things both in the overthrow of that whbich hus fallen and in the success of vwhat has socc4eded. They who, in order to estimate3 the present state of France, to judge Oftehe force of its lawrs, of the tendency of its manners, of the stability of its institutions, consult only the illudions and the rancour of portia, may think that the Government of July wrould not have fallen ift he King had changed his Ministers sooner; that the Republic would have been maintained if the Hotel de Ville had not decreed the impost of the 45 centimes; that the elect of the 10th of December would not have prevailed if the Monarchical parties in the Asembly had agreed among themselves. But those who maturelyweigh men, fact', and circumstances wil admit that the force of circumstances has controlled and led to alL The Government of Louis Philippe fell by the natural worling of its elements; the Republio perished by the application of its own doctrines; the Assembly became annihilated even before i5 was di3solved, by the effect of its own passions; and thb re-establishment, ia the person of the heir of Napoleon of the Monarchy of 1804, the form and the completioa of modern eociety, has been the general and necessary rcsakl of tho principles, the necessities, and the wi8hes of France." M. de Cassagnac defends himself from the chargae, often made against him, of inconstancy n his poli- tical predilections:- I "For more than a quarter of a eentrry the iriter of these lines has carried on, according to the measure of hti strength, a struggle which, though not attended with bri'liancy, was never free from resolition or from danger. R has been often calumniated; his adversaries souight thut diminish the authority of his word, dapairin7, perhaps, of weakeni;g its. efficany." . . . .

'-But this year this latter portion of the day's solemnity nust be omitted, for the old-King's palace is being converted into-a dwelling for a young Prince, aud all - the triasiid furhiture haa been removed for safety toMonbijou Palace. ThelPrinceof Prussia, who has ipent a few days here as well as at his 0eat Babelsberg, left here last Wednesday evening for. Breslau, where his son Prince Priedrich Wilhelmmis in.garrison. The object of the visit appears to have been that he might give the -promoters of the races and of the Industrial Exhibition now open 'there- the gratification of seeing Rbyalty -aniong them, and of' being ' prezent- at a ball which his son was to give as yesterday evening. Both Princes, father and son, return to Berlin tAls evening,to be present at the family'anniversary to-morrow; 'but will set off the same evehing for Westphalia, where the Princess of Prusdawiil join 'them. After a stay of about a week at. M-unster,- the Prince and Princess proceed to Coblentz, and their son to pay his visit to our Court at Paborne. Somb.imore recent advices from St. Petersburg state that the Emperor and :Empress of Russia willland at Eiel on the 2d of July, and willproceed thence .byway of Hamburg and Gottingen to Darmstadt, and thence to Kigsengen, where the Erapress is to take the benefit of the waters. This statement differs from what I lately sent vou, that the Imperial couple would'leave St. Petersburg on the 33thinst., and land 'at Lilbeck, and so on; but the two agree in fixing the 17th or 18th of July as the timie when the-Emperor will vwit Sans Souci with the Empress Mother, after having celebrated the birthday of .the latter, the 13th of that'month, at Wildbad., From here the Emperor willproceed, after a short stay, to Warsaw, and people tilk -of his returning hither in September to fetch the Empress, who will by that time have finished hqr courae of waters at Kissingen. According to these altered arrangements, the probability of the Emperor Alexander havng a meeting with the Emperor Louis Napoleon at Stuttgard or Baden seems to' diminish, while the prospect of the former being present at the grand autumn manceuvres of the 3d and 4th Prusian armee corps, at which the latter certainly will not appear, gains considerably in distinctness. These autumn manceuvres are to be as follo*h:-The 4th arm6e corps (the strength of such a body of troops is generally 30,000 men) will be reviewed in the neighbouthood of Magdeburg -on Soptember 8th, and after a day's rest on the 9th will perform a series of field evolutions on the three following days. The 3d arm6e corps will be reviewed on the 14th, and the corps de garde on the 15th. On the following day they will bivouac in the neighbourhood of Spandau, and on the three following days will perform field evolutions. On the 21st and 22d the entire cavalry of these two armne corps, with the exception of the Landwehr cavalry, together with the mounted artillery, will be exercised near Tempelhof, under the command of Field-Marshal Wrangel, who lately received the post of Inspector of the entire Cavalry of the Army. SPAIN. (FROM oU. OWi ConRnRsOzNDn-T.) MÂ£ADRID, Jux 3. The Spanish Government maintains strict reserve with respect to theIMexican question, but it would not be surprisig if we heard, before very long, of an armed dermonstration-against Vera Cruz. Negotiations langaish, and it may bethought that a little saltpetre would prove a wholesome stimulas. It is much.to be doubted, however, whether a mere demonstration would render the Mexican Government more pliant than hitherto. Two courses are open to Spain in the event of her deciding to begin a war. She may take Vera Cruz and march upn Mexico, or she may content herself with blockading the former place and T&mpico, the only two Mexicanportsonthe easternsideof theAmeric=n continent. With those upon the west aide she wouldprobably not think it convenientto meddle, considering the distance and the smallness of her navy. Vera Cruz would not be defended. The fortress has been neglected, is in bad condition, could not hold out, iand would be abandoned to the Spanish invading forces without any real resistance. The oDposition encountered would be on the march up to Mexico, uponwhich, besides such regular troops as the 3Iexicans might be able to bring into the field, the Spaniards would have to contend with guerillas, fever, and the climate. With such a force as Spain could land at present the expedition would be an extremely hazardous one. If the invaders reached Mexico city, occupied andheldit, they might doubtless dictate terms to the Government; on the other hand their loss could hardly be small, and their expenses would certainly be great. The war with Mexico cost the United States 20,000,0001. sterling. Whence is Spain to draw the sinews of war to even a tithe of this amount? If she content herself vith the less expensive process of a blockade, it is rnot Mexico that wiUl chiefly suffer, but foreign cre- ditors of different categories, to whom 60 per cent. of the revenues of the two Atlantic ports are allotted, leaving only 40 per cent. to enter the M cican treasury. English and French interests s4ii 'be largely jeopardized, and the question is whether these two countrieswill allow this, and will not forbid a contest 'which will be damaging to both the contending Powers, and cnm hardly benefit either. If SDain land troops, she maSt I henaure a certain men aii6 iia-inonoy, which she can very iU afford. Mexico, owing to its distanca from her shores, would be to her a sort of Vrimea on a smalU scale, with the difference that she is unable to support those expenses of war in the extrerne West which were a heavy burden on England and France in their Eastern campaign. Her commerce would be ruined, for Mexico would, immediately on the outbreak of war send thousands of letters of marque to the United States. If, for want of means, she were obliged to desist from the contest, the fact of her having engaged in it would have annulled all treaties, and her clains on Mexico would be valueless. The Mexican Government is not without resources. There can be no doubt that if hostilities commenced it 'would immediately seize the church property and levy war taxes. Spair reckoms on the co-operation of Santa Anna's p,artisans, and Mexico, if this -expectation were realized, wQuld be plunged into the horrors of a civil as well as a foreiga war. In short, whicheverway we view the question we seenothingbut certain disastersand damage for- both countries, with scarcely a chance - of benefit to either. It is diffacult to conjecture what line of conduct the United States might observe in presence of a war between their noighbours and tho Power that poswes Cuba; but one cannot 'but foresee the probability of peril to this prosperous Spanishcolony. IfEnglandandFrance would avert complications that might become ex, tremely serious, and involve them to anl extent that perhaps at present is hardly foreseen, they will interpose their authority to prevent sn unprofitablI and,. nhecessary struggle.. The matter might be submitted to arbitration- and settled without eom'. promising the interests and honour of either Darty. The first thing to bedonee.is to- bind over Berico and Spain (and especially the latter) to keep the peace. . -There was X vehement debate. in the Congrs ye terday, ending at past 8 o'.clock in a diviion. The addres to the Throne was carried by 221. votew agaimst 10.

General Allende Sala2ar,- rho was sent by Espartero from Saragofa, in July, 1854, to state to the.QeQeen the couditionson Whirh he wouldoonsent toplace-himselfat,thehladof the Govermment. The Liberal Union (so called) of the ProgTesista, aud-ef-a fraction of the Moderado party,aloreoceivedv little mercy at his hands. At a very lato hour, and' amidtioud cries for-a division, the Progrita depntry Gonizales de: La Vega, - rose to repel the attacks on his 'political-.friends. The impatient Chamber-in which. he re,okoned, as the divi.ion proved, - only nine suppoztes ()ould scarcely .hear him, bhat he stoatly persiited, and, by the aid of good lifngs, comlleid all piesentto hear his declaration: that Generals -Espertero -and Allende Salazar were -perfect gentlemen, honourable soldiers,Cauod loya.

With'reference to a paragraph in the semi-offiicial Copondendcia Autografa, Qf which I sent you a translation in my letter of the 1st inst i the Clamor P'ublico demands that the Government should declare its intentions -.wJth 'respect to the reported proposed settlement of the debt, and especially of the 'coupons and Dntch dAbk,- and bring the natter before the Cortes, instead' of keeping the Mfadrid and foreig-altock-eichanges in a state of uncertainty and agitation, by suffering mysterious and incomprehensible rumours to be circulated by what is supposed to be a sort of Ministerial.organ.

A letter from the Roman States, dated the 27th nlt., states that Cardinal Autonelli has addressed a circular to the provincial authorities forbidding the Communal Councils to assemble. The cause-assigned for 'this measure is to prevent the Council from taking advantage of the journey of His Hloliness to express their complaints and makle known their wishes. His Eminence now believes that he has anticipated the dangerby his circular. The prohibition is so peremptory that the Gonfalonieri have not even called the Communal Councils together to deliberate on the expenses to be incurred on the occasion of the Pope's reception. Each Mayor acts on his own authority, and the communal budget must provide for those expenses withoutthe Council being consulted. Cardinal Antonelli appearstobe perfectly indifferent whether the legal forms are railpected or not. The Holy Father has hitherto met the same reception from the population in the Marches as he did in the other provinces. The crowds were numerous on his passage, but they observed a respectful silence.
A USTBAIA. [The following appeared in our second edition of yeserday :-] We take the following snmmary of Australian news from the Melbournw Argts of the 14th of April:- " Our last summary was despatched by the European Royal Mail steamship on the 15th of March. The departure of the Columbian affords an exceUent opportunity for the transmission to Europe of another chapter ia the history of the progress of the colony. "The yield of the goldfields continues to be subject to the fluctuations with which the current year commenced. The mildness of the weather and the scarcity of water have been protracted over a longer season than usual, and the escort returns have not been mantained up to the average of the year 1856. It is, however, satisfactory to know that they have been considerably above the average of the years 1854-55. The receipts by escort and the shipments for the first three months of the following years were X 155 1653. race. 1857. CZ. or or. OZ.

The ship. ments, under all disadvantages, still keep up to the average of 10 tons troy per month, or 120 tons per year, a sum total not to be despised from a colony so sparsely populated. The decline in the escorts is to be attributed to the fact that the improved state of the roads enxbles coaches to run through to Melbourne in a day, quite as much as to the undoubted temporary fuoctuation in the yield. " When the wet weather haa set in sufficiently to fiood the creeks and the old waterholes the escort returas will show a decided improvement.

ATONBEY-MARKETand CITYINTELLIGENCE. Monday Evening. The English funds opened steadily this morning at the final prices of Saturday, but the market became weak at the end of the day. The first operations in Consols for money were at 93& to 94, and they left off at 93u to J for money, and 944 to X for the 9th of July. Lower quotations from the Paris Bourse, together with further accoiunts in confirmation of the late unfavourable turn in the prospects of thesilk cropin France and.Italy, were the chief causes of the tendency to depression. Sonme rather large sales which were rumoured to have been effected to close theaccountsofa private speculatorwhois alleged to have failedtopayhis differences tohis brokers also contributed to the adverse feeling. But for large additional gold arrivals, and the satisfactory reports of the growing grain in England and throughout Europe, a greater reaction would, probably, have been experienced. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92! to i ; New Three per Cents., 92a to I; and Exchequer-bills, March, 2s. discount to 2s. pm. The demand for money is full, but not excessive. At the Bank the applications, although numerous, are not more than might be anticipated, looking at the amount withdrawn from circulation by the revenue receipts at this period of the quarter. Foreign securities have exhibited steadiness, but there was less animation towards the close. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 94j and J; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 101J. The general transactions comprised-Mexican Three per Cents., 22 ; Peruvian Four-and-aIHalf per Cnts., 76i; Russian Five per Cents., 108I ; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97k; Spanish Certificates, 6A ;. Venezuela, for account, 35 and 36; and Datoh Four per Cent. Certificates, 97K. The corn-market was dull this morning at the prices of last week. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 35c. ex. dividend for money, and 67f. 6Wc. for the end of the month, ahowing a decline of a quarter per cent. The specie from New York to-day by the Asia is 305,7501., of which a portion is believed to be on French account. The Kent, from Australia, has been announced with 62,221 ounces [of gold, valued at 249,0001. About 112,0001. out of the 346,0001. of Australian gold'brought by the Sussex and Walner Castle was sold to the Bank to-day, and a further considerable portion i6 expected tobe taken there. It is understood also that within the last few days some remittances of sovereigns have been received from Ireland. The tone of the commercial letters from India to-day is not unfavourable. At Bombay the transactions had been limited, but at Cilcutta there had been an extensive business and prices were firm, although there had been large arrivals. A disposition to subscribe to the New Five per Cent. foan was likevise a satisfactory feature. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been dispo3ed of to;day at 61id. per ounce, being an advance of id. upon the price realized for that by the previous packet. It appea, that the extraordinary flow of specie to India and China receives large additions direct from the goldfields. During the month of March the totals sent from Melbourne included 32,0001. to India and 45,5001. to China. The reports fromthe manufacturing towns for the past week indicate a continued disposition to guard againstthe probable effect of high prices in ocusing a falling off of consumption. At Manchester the market has beea benefited by the suspension of work consequent upon Whitauntide, and the general arrangements for the future diminution of the rate of production. In the hosiery and woollen districts. there has been general quietness. At Birmingham, in the iron and other trades, there iB a fair amount of employment, but no signs of great activity. The further reduction announeed during the week in the prices of tin and copper is expected, however, to impart animation to several branches of manufacture. The Irish linen-markets are without alteration. At a meeting of the Bank of Australasia held today, Mr. T. W. Henderson presiding, a dividend and bonus at the rate of 20 per cent. were ddclared, and the4 report and accounts were unanimously adopted. In the course of his address the chairman alluded to the progress of the bank, particularly in reference to the result of operations since the gold discoveries, the improvement in the dividends, and the accumulation of a guarantee fund of 200,0001. Through the new charter some modifications have been gained, which, it is believed, will prove advantageous and assist to develope business. With regard to a legislative recommendation for establishing na ational bank of issue in Australia, the recent advicea mention that the project has been abandoned. Although the Bank of Australasia is in a sound and prosperous position, the state of affairs in the colonies, with the prevailing competition, induces the directors to warn the shareholders against relying too much on the maintenance of the existing rate of dividend. In answer to questions it was stated thawt- it is extpected about 8001. per annum will be realized from the rent of the addiational offices of the London establishment, and that the last accounts from the colony are of a satifactory nature. Subjoined is an abstract of the report:- "The directors have the satisfaction of presenting the following statemeats, showing the resalt of transaotions for the year to the 13th of October, 1856. "The profit and loss account at that date stood as follows:- Balance at the credit of profit and low, 15lth of Otober, 855, asperl report.. .. .. .. .. .. z 1611 Ziet proflt In the year, to the 13th of Oetober. 1856, pro. vion having boen made tor ba4 and doubtful debt4. cno^tac. 1s81,110 o 6 "Divided among the proprieto s:- Â£33L77 T7 6 At April, 1856, a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and a bonus at the rate of 14 per cent, per annurm, rakiog together el per share.. ..

They have now to state that the spirit of over.speculation, though maderated, has not yet whollysub. sided, and that tho progress of recovery in anercaitile allaire has been consequently rearded. The geoldfields have increased in productiveness, and continue to exercise a bene. ficial influence oerr the generat prosperity of the coloieg, At tho same timelthe directors have -to observe that the profits on exchange ojperutions, which form an importait doepatment of baking in Australia' have, throughout the year under review, beec unfavourably affected by the rela. tively high price of gold. The directors have to announoe that snce the commenoement of the present year the bank hbas baen acting under the provisions of thoe new charter granted by the Crown for another term of 21 years, anid in which some advantageous alterations have beun made, the limited liability of the shareholders remaining unchanged. The foregoing figures reptesent the state of the accounts at the yearly balance in October le8t. The directors have sinoe received advices from the colonies down to a recent date, which, although still exhibiting the effects of over. stocked markets and a cohtinuence of the high price of gold, will not interfere with their intention of declaring s divdend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, or 24s. per share, and a bonus at the rate of 14 per cent. per anumw, or 56s. per share, fof the current half-year. being at the rate of 20 oer cent. per annum, payable on the 13th of October next, tree of income-tax." Advices from Breslau state that the great annual wool fair Is nearly concluded, about 40,000cwt. having been sold up to the 6th inst. chiefly to manufacturers, native and foreign. Prices on the average had exhibited'a reduction of 7i per cent.- about 2d. per lb.-in. middling, 3d. in line, and 4d. in the finest, descriptions. D)ealers held aloof on account, it is supposed, of the atringency of the 2noney-market. The Sydney paipers received to-day describe the opening of the Great Northern Railway from Newcastle to Maitland, in the Hunter River distriot. It was commenoed Xt the end of. 1854, its length im 16j miles, and the cost of construction has averaged 10,000t. per rnile. The departures from the port of London for the Australian coloniea during the past week have coniprised nine vessels, five (two "in ballast") to Sydney, one to Port 'Phillip, one to Adelaide, one to Etobart Town, and o3ie to Newv Zealand, with an aggregate- capacity of 7,588 tons. The, rates of freight exhibit a Blight tendency to improvement. The general businessof the port of London has again been very active during the past week. The number of vessels reported inward was 332, being 91 more thauin theprevious week. The number cleared outward was 110, including 15 in ballast, sbowing a decrease of six. The total of vessels on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 49, being 10 less than at the last account. Of those now loading seven are for Adelaide, three for Ceelong, five for Hobart Town, three for Launceston, oane for qelbourne, one for Moreton Bay, foup foi, ew Zealand, 12 for Port Phillip, tivo for Portland :Bay,one for Port Fairy, eight for Sydney, and one for Swan River. Of these one was entered outward in February, three in March, and 19 in Aprl The annexed communication refers to the existence of a 'very objectiopvable anomaly between' thb' bankruptcy law and cnmeicantile custom with regard to the extent of individual liabilitiea on bills of exchange:- "Liverpool and London Chambers, 27a, Bucklershury' June 6. "Sir,-Will you allow me to offer a few remarks with reference to admitting proofs in bankruptcy on bills of exÂ¢hange g? In The limes of to-day there is a report of an apt to, theordsJustices against a decision of Ar. Comm joner Holroyd. TXhe case is shortly this:-ThaLon:donJoint-Stock Bank re6tives a composition of 14s. 93d. ln thc pound from tho drawersof abillof exchange forl ,428Z.'10s. hLld by them,; andaclaiisi to prove its full amount againit ho estate1 of thb acceptors of the said bill, who subsequently became bankraqpts, -hauding over, of course, to the proper paxtles, any sums receiied be.yend 20s. in the pound. The commissioner, aÂ¢ting on prectdents and the state of the bankrupt lawis, wiU only admit proof for the balance nLok received under the composition; thts decision has bten affirmed,bythe.Cou*ofC=4nce1y; and it the cise Ifcar#el4 to the House of Lords .t wiM probably notberevers d. Now, I subnit that this 8tate,of tho bankrupt law,;r& A n counter to the commoni law, is an injustice to creditqra. The learned commissioner himself seems quite awiaref it. He said,-J' admit is idiBicult to undertand the prinrci l; 'upon which the rule ot bhankruptcy is founded-namnly, that where a part psyiaent has been received' bef9rethe proof is tendered it op'rates as, a discharge pro tanto. the object seems to have been prevent a party from xeceivwg' ,wbat 'he ha no just zight to.' Surely, it is extraor' loeio to say that in ord'er 'to prevent a party receivingwv lt he had nojust zight to' (that is,' mre than 20s. in thponl d) the law should make him take legs than his just claim. he remedy is simple. Let the officialsassighee retaintheoi3rplus for the benefit of 'the estate. As the law iow staiLds it iflicts a hardship on those who wish to compound v th creditors, and who aze drawers .of bills of excbange; {he holders thereof naturally prefer -waiting to sbe the fate I of the bills; if; the acceptors go to bankruptcy they caprpW6ve for the full amounb, and theni make terms pith.. ohe drawers, hence delay and injury to the com pounders.

sMITErS DTVOBaU. HOUSE OF LORD. Junm A. Their Lordships sat this afeernoon at 2 nclock for the purpose of eonsidering the petition of Henry Smitbh hariter.atlaw. of Inaer Temple-lane, and Belle Isle, Windermere, Westmoreland, praying that his marriage with Julia, his now wife, might be dimolved, aad that he might be allowed to mrry again. -r. WYLDr9.(with whom was Mr. Hollhid) said he had the hononr of appoaring at their Lordshipe' bar in support of the petition. The parties were married on the 19th. of February, 1853, at the parish church of St. Marylebone, 3iddlesex. A t that period -the petitioner ws 22 years of age, and 3is. Smith was 20. After their marriage they travelledabout a great deal, and ia 1854 they went to reside for a short period at 1)inan, in France. There they met a M. Leopold Datertre, a French subject, the son of a gentlenian of considerable means. In 1856 they again paid a visit to Dinan, and again they met iLDatertre, whobecameApparently a vety intimate friend of the petitioner. In December, 1856, Mr. Smith was clled to LAverpool upon some important basiness oonnected with his deceaed fathers property of which he was a truste, and he accordinely brought l wife over to England and left her at tho house of her married sisker, a MiELPinhorn, reddingsatWyke, inDorsetshir. During her hiabend's abienOO at iverpool Mrs. Smith eloped witht M. Dntertre, who was waiting for her at Southampton, and it would beaptoved tht they hadaeversincebeen livingin open adultery at Paris a manandwife. An action haa been brought in the Cortof ExoheragaiteopoldDaterte and a Terdict for e plain iff was found, with 3.0001. damages, which, hoWeTer, the petitioner, had been unable to recover.

COURTB OF.VA,fRVUpTCZ Monday, June & IX up. c.AlTDRV- (Before Mr. COM7r&moncr GoULBURN.) "IW uaurmpt 'ma tV.a landlord of the Catherino Wheel, PSouthwark, This was the cort' fieate meeting. fur. Chidley app eared for the bankrupt, Mr. Lawrrauca for the assignees. The COtneRD awarded a third class certificate. Athird cbas aacrtificate was also graated to F. Wigney, p teadstatIoner, o righton, r. Turner Â£or the asiG4nees no' objecting. BE G. C. FRANQRIADI. Theo, aakrupt was a morchant of Old Brond.streot. T s a wag the certificate meeting. IS. Lawrance appeared for the bankrupt, Mr. Peachy for the assignees, and Mr. IL Abrnhams for Mr. Lizard, a cr ditor. Tho hearing of the applcation gave rise to a protracted idiscussion. The leading facts will, however, be best given in the form of n descriptive summary. The bankrupt traded in partnership with his brother and one Valenti. They had three houses-one in England, the second at Trieste, and the third at lexandria. The three housers were dis,tinct, although onosittg of the same individuals. The London house is bankrnt't and the two other housesareinsolvent and beingwound up at Trieste and Alexandria. The bankrupt's trading omnmenced on the Ist of January, IS3, with a capital or earplus of 12,0001.,!aLd closes with unsecured creditors, 96,4981.; liabilities. 41,0001., of which 25,W1. are empected to become proofs against the estate;* and assets about 24,0001. Mr. PEACHY, for tbe &ssignees, was wzilling that the bankrupt should now receive a lrtclass certificate. Mr. AsBB.AHMs prayed an adjournment of three months, to obtain information of ehe position of the firms at Trieste ened Alexeadria. Mr. LA.wRANC pressed for immediate judgment. It appeared that the London and Trieste firms had drawn bills upon each other to a large amount. A portion of these bills must comeagainst the estate. An adjournment was resisted mainly on the following grounds:-The proceedings under which insolvent estates were wound up abroad 'were of an uncertain and tedious character, and an ad. journmnent to be of any value in obtaining information -must be for a perod of notlessthan 12 months. No benefit could be derived to the bankrupts estate here from any laim the London firm haxs upon the Trieste and Alexandrian houses, because it 'was a law well established that partners could not prove in competition with other ereditora until 20a in the pound hadbeenpaid by the estate. In the case of Castelli the Lord Justices had overraled a decision of Mr. Commissioner Holroyd, deferring judgment. With the exception of one creditor all the creditors were willing that the bankrupt should now receive a certificate of the first class. The delay of a oertificate would have the f ffect of keeping the bankrupt out of a lucrative situation. His HONeouR expressed an opinion that the question could only be one of first or second-class certificate. In a matter, however, involving debts and liabilities to the amount of 157,0001-not by any means a light matter-and where the bankrupt had partners, and two other houses, it mnight not be wellto rush at once to a judgment. As regarded Castelli's case and this, everything in this case depended upon time, and he did not consider it reasonable to osh toa Judgment on a case which had as yet been before the Court only ten weeka There would be a sittin on'Thursday next to decide upon some claims. An affidavst could ba then laid before him in support of an immediate judgment. At present he was inclined to order an adjournment for a short period. It was stated by the official assignee that a dividend of about 2s. 6d. in the pound will shortly be declared. The amonnt of any further dividend would depeRd against which of the estates certain creditors should elect to prove. (Before Mr. Commissioncr FhaN1) ne RE ADOLPHUS HARRISON FESTEL. The bankrupt was a wine merchant of 25, Bucklersbury. The petitioning creditor is Mr. Benjamin Wood, wine mer. chant, of Blackfriars, who did not, however, now appear and the choice of assignees wsas deferred. The bankrupt was sentenced to two years' imprisonment at the time that Madame Denis left the country. He subsequently brought an action against several noblemen for wine supplied, and in the case of an action against the marquis of Bath was nonsuited. Mr. BARoNv now applied for his release from prison. Mr. LrcAs, for the Marquis of Bath, cpposed, on the gronnd that the bankrupt was in custody for the costs in. ourred in a most mischievous action, and that the bankxeptcy was got up to obtain a release from those costs. The CommissIoxER said this was not an ordinary case. He should not interfere-certainly not at present. A person who got up such an action ought to suffer. IN RE JOHN MARYS. The bankrupt wras a coachbuiLder of Longacre. His debts and liabUities are said to be about 60,0001., his assets about 25,0001, inclusve of consignments to a large amount to Australi. HIe WAS arrested when about to disLose of property of large amount by auction at Ipswich. This was a meeting for the proof of debts and choice of asssignees. MIr. Wilkinson, MIr. Chidley. and Mr. Mlay appearued for fcreditors; Mr. Bicknell, saddler, and MIr. Morris, hor,se milliner, 'were choson assignees. Debts to the amount of aout 20,000 were proved during the day.
LYSOLVEAN-T DEBOBRS' COURT, June 8. D R NIAM GRORGE HOWARD. (Before Xe CHIEF COllm1iOS,-ER' Â±mus insolvent, tee nephew or the present Earl of Wicklow, and heir presumptive to that title, aplied to be libe-atecd upon sureties until the day appoint for his hearing, the 24th inst. Mr. M'Oubrey appeared for a detaining creditor, Mr. Elmore; and two other creditors, Mr. Thompson and Yr. Abrahams. appeared in person; Mr. Sargood and Mr. Rxed supportd the application. The insolvent was arrested on the 26th of Febraary, 1853, and has remained in the Qneen's Prison from that date until now. A vesting order had been obtained upoa a zreditor's petition, whereupon the present schedule has beea filed. That document states the aggregate amount of debts to be 179,1161., of which 136,3001. are debts for which no consideration has been received, 15,0001. are twice entered, and the debts for oonsideration are 27,8151. The property to meet these claims are 2,6001. debts and the expectancies on succecding to the Wicklow peerage. The sureties proposed were Mr. Evdward Rawson Clark, of Drayton-villa, Brompton, and Hednesford, Staffordshire, geutleman, and Mr. Flintoff, of Hednesford, trainer. Mr. SARGOOD requested permlssion for Mr. Clark, one of the proposed sureties, to amend his affidavit, in which he bad sworn that he never had petitioned this (the Insolvent) Court, whereas, in fact, mnany years ago he had been discharged under the Act at Wakefield. Hz. Clark had mentioned the fact at the time of signing his affidavit, but had been erroneously informed that the London court was distinct fromn the country courts. Mr. E. R. Clark was then examined by Mir. M'Oubrey, in answer to whose questions he stated that he was insolvent at Wakefield in 1 for about 3601. He had paid the whole of those debts except one of about 901. to a Moss Da-nds, which he did not really ewe. He had obtained a deed of release from all his creditors except Davids, and had intended to apply to have his petition removed from the file <of the Court, but had been too much occupied to think ciboxit it. Mr. Thompson then questioned Mr. Clark respecting certain udgmentn which appeared to be registered against him, but the wites swore that they had all been satisfied except one of 1561. to Mr. H. D. Boulton, of which he knew nothing. The property at Drayton-villa was valuable, but he could not say whether his father-in-law, Mfr. Kealy, had any claim upon it as trustee. The property was settled upon Mrs. Clark at the marriage. The CHIBF COntSIsos , having referred to Mr. -Clark's schedu that the total debts therein entered wr ,31 Mr. Clark said many debts were inserted which ought not to have been, and repeated his former statement that he liad settled with all the creditors except Moss Davids. The CjnrFF COMrISScoNxm inquired the reason of the insolvent's long stay in prison without appealing to this Court. The insolvent said he had been in hopes to have arranged -writh his creditors. Mr. SARGOOD explained the necessity for the present ap. plication by putting in a medical certificate stating that the Insolvent's health suffered from a continued confinement. As that health was important to the creditors, his survivorship over the present Earl of Wicklow being their only chance of payment, it really was for the benefit of the estate that the application should be granted. Mr. Littler, a detaining creditor, then asked leave to oppose the hail. In answer to nuestions from the Court Iie said he had been a farmer at Wasltham-abby, and was the holder of an acceptance of the insolvent for 3001., -which he had reeived from a Mr. Christopher, who was mow the manager of Mir. Elwes's racehorses. The insolvent, in explanation of the debt, said he gave three bUls of exchange for 1001. each in 1849, when he was very roung, to Christopher, and had subsequently renewed them. He had been arrested in 1852 by Mr. Littler, and Mr. E. R. Clark had paid some money to procure his liber4-tion. Ilr. Clark (who had been forced to retire fromn the court on account of ilanes) was then examined by Mr. Littler. He repeated his former statements with regard to the proxpety at Di)rayton-villa; and further said he had other property at ladnesford worth at least 8, 0001., the whole of which was nuencumbered. Upon striking a balance of his debts and assetc he reckoned the first at 7,0001., and the latter at 90,0001. He had one horse that was worth more than 5,W000. Mr. Thwmpson 'wibed to know the names of the horses PA Uednesford, in -or&z to judge of their value. Mr. Clark refused to etate the aames publicly, although he was wllling to communicte theca privately to the learned Commissioner. Hr. Littler was er'gaged in speculations on thb turf, and had an interest in floding out the secrets of las. tlr. Clark'6) stable. iLr. Thompson then asked whether Mr. Clark's name was not attachcd to certain bills in Mr. Mather's hands. Mr. Clark admitted the fact, bat denied ,'bat he was liable. Mr. Mather had given a written guarantis to hold him barraless if he would place him in a posit.'on to sue Mr. Frank Villies.. 'Upon further examination it appeared that Mr. Clarkhad held threepost obit bonds given by the insolvent 'Â° Eecure payment of a debt due for transactions upon the t*f, they aving been " confederates." One bond to secure th. Payment of 15,0001. he had sold in February last with the insolvent's concurrence to a Mr. Glenny. Mr. M'OUBREY then bummed up his objections to the bail. The error in Mr. Clark's affidavit was, he submitted, tataL. Even if that were not the case his unencumbered property was too ill defiLned to justify the Court in receiving ni-n as a surety for 5,40101. Mr. SAROOD submitted that, omitting the property at Drayton.villa, Mr. Clark had sworn to property at Hedneslord o f the valuo of 8,0001,, which wfas sufficient for the pro. posed hail, if the Court should coengnt to that amount. The Cssrr COMMI.SIONER said he could not. pecept .5ra ClarTc'asce;arity so long as he remained a etitioner to this CGU"@ 6ws isreaz seGd4 )u iqcelyg that petutfQD must be removed from the file. In the next place, tho statement of his property was not sufficiently clear; the extent of liability under the marriage settlement was not defined, and no specific account of the valee of thc other property bed tbeeil given. Mjrr. Clark might have a very good reaso t for dclining to give th0 names of his racehorses to : Ir Littler, but the aourt must have that informatiOn. A?, one -eorse differed very mouch in value from another. TI',0 case tnmuse be adjourned at present. !r I2RE J. W. IOlWELL. This insolvent, whose case has been before re porteod appeared for judgment. Mr. G. Cruikabank, the -we31-known artiWt, applied that the insolvent might be required to amend his schedule in respect of an entry wherein he (Mr. Cro'ckshank) was in. serted as a debtor for 1301. The learned ComTn_AootER referred to the entry, which stated the claim to be made for services rendered to the General rndustry Life and Fire Assance Society, of which Mr. Cruikahank was a director. Mr. Cruiksbahak said he had a certificate from Mr. Tidd Pratt showing that the society had never been enrolled, and therefore never had a legal existence. The learned CooManssiowE observed that Mr. Crulkshank was the only director who was entered as a debtor. In the prospectus he found other names, and one the member for Westminster. Mr. Cruickshank stted that Sir J. Shelley had written him a letter, stating that his name.had been used without authority. The COitF Commzssioxm: thought that very likely. The insolvent, however, as he chose to put down one director, must enter all, and the proper time for them to dispute their liability was when an attempt was made, if ever, to enforce it. A case had been proved against the insolvent by a printer named Lovett, whose debt had been improperly contracted, and although he had been in Prison sinceO ctober, and was in bad health, the Court was bound to pronounce an adverse judgment, although its severity would be modified on account of these circumstances. The Insolveut would be diecharged at the expiration of three calendar months from the vesting order (April 23).
POLICB. MAXSION-H0US.-EUizabeth Bell, a steady-looking, welldresed, middle-aged pcerson, was brought before Alderman HALE charged vith having stolen 108 paLirs of gloves, of the value of , the goods of hlessrs. Augustus Bolle de Lasalle and Co., of No. 41, Gutter-lane, hosiers, She was committed for trial. MARLEOROUGH-STREr.-Joseph Dalby, a ticket-of-leave convict, was brought before Mr. BEADON for final examina. tion charged 'with having been concerned in a burglary at the house of Dr. Nussey, No. 4, Cleveland-row. It appeared that Police-sergeant Crocker (one of the constables shot at by the convict Russell) was passing through Compton-street when he saw the prisoner and three other thieves loitering about. As the prisoner answered the description of a man who had committed a burglary at the house of Dr. Nussey he procured assistance, and after a short struggle secured them ally A boy who could identify one of the men who had entered Dr. Nussey's house was sent for, and he immediately pointed out the prisoner as one of the burgla The prisoner was then brought to this court and charged with bulsry. Henry Slark, servant to Dr Nussey, said, on the 4th of May. about 1 in the morning, while in bed, he heard anoise in tne surgery. He sat up in bed and listened, and then eaw the prwsoner come round the counter in the surgery with a Dight an his hand. There vas another mnan with the prisoner. Witness called out and asked what they wanted. He m3do no reply, but put out the light and ran off. Police-Sergeant Glass, C division, examined Dr. Nussev's house, and found footmarkB on the wall and ledge over the surgery. The skylight had been forced completely off by a crowbar or jemmy. The thieves had only time to break open one desk before the bo discovered them. Polce-Sergeant Crocker, 6 division, from the boy's description of one of the thieves, suspected the prisoner, and apprehendedc him with three others in Compton-street. On one of the other prisoners, who was arm in arm with the prisoner, he found a crowbar, which exactly fitted the marks on the skylight and desk. The prisoner denied the charge, but the boy was positive as to his identity. The prisoner was fully committed. It appeared that Dr. Nassey's house has been twice attempted since May. The three companions of the prisoner, being well-known thieves, were sentenced, John Donovan tothree months, and BenJamin Stevens and George Groom to two months The following additional subscriptions have been receiveed for Wiliam Bray and his idiot family :-" Lord Strafford," 11. ; "Anon.," 51. n ',T J.;:21. 21 P D.., 2,.

WnbsTamisTi-George Purdy, a man who was discharged a few days ago from custodi for uttering base coin, vas charged with being concerno with another named Colkman in stealing a writingdesk containingsome valuable coins and a number of other articles from the house of Mr. Hunt, 6, Green's-row, Chelsea, keeper of the mining record in the Government Museum of Geology. The prisoner, who made no defence, was remanded, to be brought up for -examination with Coleman. WOP.S}P sRErmr.-James Shadrach, a middle-age man, was charged before Mr. D'BxcoOvRT with the following brutality : The prisoner's wife, a clean but wretched-looking roman, with an infant three months old in her arms, said,-This man is my husband, and a carpenterby trade. On Saturlay night, as he did not come home, I went out to look for him, but could not find him, and after I had returmed home a short time, between 9 and 10 o'clock, he came in drunk. I saWd it was a shame, or very wrong of him, not to come home earlier, to which he made no reply whatever, bat cooly got up, locked the door, struck me a violentblow upon the eye with his fist, then another on the mouth, cutting my li,hn dme down, adstruck me on the head after nmy bead now. I called out for help, and he threatened me If I did not be quiet, saying he would be hung for me, and also said I was drunk, but v was not. By Mr. D'EyycouRT.-I had my infant in my arms aU the time he did this. We have been married nine years, and I have had three children by him. He earns from 30s. to 21. a-week, but he only gives me sometimes 5s. and sometimes 7s. a-week, and spends all the rest on himself. He knocked three of my teeth out on Saturday night-one of them through my upper lip, and he also jumped uoon me while I was in the familyway. (The woman here exhibited her upper lip, which was much swooUen, very sore, and seemingly cut through, and there was blood on the clothes of the infant she held in her arms.) An elderly woman named Mary Anne Ford said,-I don't know anything of this woman or her husband, except from being a neighbour, but I do know that she is a very good woman, and nearly starves herself to feed the family, which and her place she keeps very clean. I have often heard him beat her before this, and now I did not see it, bet I heard her scream so for help that it would have softened a stone. She said, " Oh, don't kill my baby ! Oh, do somebody comae and take my poor baby I' Her screams and cries of "Marder" were dreadful. King, 22 H.-I was fetched to the house, and found the prisoner drunk. The wife was perfectly sober, but bleeding a great deal from the mouth, and one of her teeth had been forced tbrough her upper lp. Mr. D EYNCOuRT (to the prisoner).-And what have you to say to AUl this ? Prisoner.-Well, I told her not to aggravate me so, as I was in liqor ; but she would do it. Mr. D'IYTNCouRT.-Every one here who has heard the evidence asainst you must feel thoroughly shocked at t' e brutality of which you have been guilty. The Legislature is endeavouring by every possible means to put a check upon these cruel acts of violence, and the whole country is indignant at the constant repetition of such outrages, and well it may be, for they do not cease. I shall mark my sense of your conduct by sentenoing you to six months' imprisonment in the House of Correction, with hard labour, and at the expiration of that you must find bail for your good behaviour for three mnonths longer. The wife asked what she was to do; the prisoner had brought her home no mon,ey at all on Saturday night, and she blad nothing to support her and the children. Mr. D'EYNCOURT irected 5is. to be given her, and ordered muquiries to be made as to what could be done for her. TnAarns.-William Moyce, a gardener, described as a labourer, aged 40, of George.street, Bromley, and MIary Scott, a married woman, of No. 3, Nelsoa-street, Bromley, Were brought before Mr. SEnL-F, the former charged with feloniouslY and maliciously shooting at Mr. John Joseph Hickmott, a builder and timber merchant in the Mile-end. road, with intent to murder him, and the woman was charged with using threatening language towards a sheriff's officer and obstructing him in the execution of his duty. a. medical certificate was put in, stating that mr. Hickrnott, who is one of the guardians of the poor of Mile-end Old-town, and deservedly respeoted in that hamlet, was seriouBly wounded and -unable to leave his room. It appeared from the evidence of Daniel Gover, assistant to Mr. Sloman, sheriff's officer of No. 22, Chancery. lane, that he went that morning with a writ of possession to the cottage and market-garden ground in the Occupation of the defendant in Broley. Rearing the male prioDner -was a violent man, he took two polce-coiontables with him to render aid in cae of necessity, and Mr. Hickmott, the plaintif in the action and owner of the premises, also acm-p panied him. The male prisoner was in a corner of the garden and was shown the writ of possession, and asked to give unp possesidon of the house and premises, to which he repied that he would not, and made a great disturbance. The door of the cottage was broken open, and witnes and his assistants rooeeded to remove the furniture out of it. The poner [oyoe became more violent than ever, and by his h out, and tbreats caused a great many por. eons towassemble. The inale prisonEr was expotu auted with, but in vain, and he took up a loaded gun, and ad if he was not left in the quiet possesa ion of the cottage he would shoot some one. A Mr. Phillips and two polioo coustables rewonstrated with thle prisoner, and asked him to give up the gun, which he -it fused to do, and, after rome par]eying. the prisoner fired the contents of the gun into the air. The gnu was then put into the parlour, and the removal of the umniture and ovntents was continued. All this time the femae prisonr oonducted berself in a most violent manner, and maade use n' threats and bad language towards every one engaged in exe, ting the process of the law. Soon afterwards Moyfe suddeA 'lyappreared with the gun in his hand, and levelled it at Mr. . 'Ickm-Ott, who was standing ia the garden, and fired.

He saw Mr. Hioknott stagger and.falL -Mr. SELFE.-He is wounded with small shot? Gover.-I believe ho is, Sir. The medical men in attendance upon him havo by no means given a favourable account of the state he is in. Air. SELE.-No; but they do not say he is in danger. I hope he is not. bMoyce, in defence, made a rambling statement, and said he was at the top of his garden when he heard people forcing their way into his cottage, and others taking lis tbings out. He requested permission to go into the cottage which was refused. He had no notice of the ejectment. He had been in possession of the cottage and garden 23 ye, and thought it very hard, to be disaossessed of it. bome time ago Mr. Hickmott obtained an ejectmient from Baron Martin agaiDst his mother, pulled out 6s. 8d. which he offered to her, and so terrified the poor old woman that she died two nights afterwards. Mr. SxLFx.-Yon are charged with firing a gun, loaded with small shot, at Mr. HEikmott. Have you anything to say to that ? lo ce, inrepl to the question, said,-I had no thought abut ,ne wheXfired the gun. Gover said that Moyoe had not been in possession of the houseand groundsolongas he had stated, and had been treated vwth great indulgence by Mr. Hickmott. mr. SauRx said he wonld allow the female prisoner to be set at liberty -n her promise to appear before him on Saturday noxt, and remanded Moyce to prison until that day. A donation of 20s. for the poor-box has been received from "I . H. L," with a request that the same should be acknowledged In T7h Timm.

GLASGOW, June 6.-Cotton.-Oar cotton-market has presented no feature worthy of notice this week. The demand each day has been to a fair though by no means large extent and prices keep very firm. There was rathor more tone aDout the market on Thursdayaud yesterday, but to-day we are again very quiet. Goods and Yarns.-Our market is without change; the demand is still limited, and pnces tending sHghtly downwards.

From Liverpool reports of transactions at 100w, and 94s. have been circulated but these are exceptional cases, buying against de. faulters. It is beheved that the case between :essrs. Bailey,of Liverpool, and Counal, of this city, has been compromised, and it is reported that the warrant system will orthwtth be put on a more satisfaotory footinDg To.dav the tone of the market has been dull, iron offered at 79s. 6L Srompt remaining unsold; No. 1, g.m.b., 79s. 6d.; No. (Advertisement.]-.Her Majesty's Drawing Rtoom.-The second editLon of the " Court Journal" published 7wetewday con- tains the only complete amount of the Drawing Room ot Sat,urd with a ful decription of thec stumes and exelusive remarks.

DEATH OF MR. DOUGLAS JERROLD. The intelligence conveyed by the above heading will probably take the whole lterary public of En&g land completely by surprise. But a few days ago MIr. Douglas Jerrold was a prominent figure in Lon-. don life. Ans assembly of " wits" would hardly have been deemed-complete without his presence, andhis last bon mot was one of those ite oE news that everybody was glad to hear. To the special world I -which he cbiefly existed it is scarcely necesary to say that his illness was of short duration. On Sunday night he took leave of severalof his intimate friendas and shortly after the noon of yesterday his earthly career had terminated. Mr. Douglas Jerrold was in a great measure what may be styled a "self-educated" man, and the celebrity he attained with every class of his countrymen that is capable of appreciatig intlectual worth may be cited among the many instanoes that show how distinct is the path to fame from any of those beaten tracks of in8truction that time and usage have prescribed. He -was born in London on the 3d of Januay, 1803, and to- the fact that his father was manager of the Sheerness Theatre may be attributed that prodileetion for the stage which forms a leading characteritic of the greater portion of his life. However, his earliest expressed passion, fostered no doubt by the scene which Sheer eas presented during the height of the war, wss for a maritime life, and he obtained a midshipman's appointment through the good officesof Captain Austen, brother of Miss Austen, the novelist. With the war ended his nautical career, and, on quitting the service, he was apprenticed to a printer in London. His leisure hours were now devoted to self-insruction, Aakspeare being his chief author. An essay on the opera of Der Freischiitz which he dropped into the editorial box of a newspaper on which he was employed as a compositor is the reported beginning of his literary labour. To his infinite delight. his own anonymous " copy" was handed over to him to put in type, and shortly ,afterwards appeared au editorial notice soliciting other contributions from the unknown correspondent. Bla-ey,ed Susan, originally produced at the Surrey Theatre, under the management of Mr. Elliston, and afterwards trnferred to Drury-lane, is generally considered the first of his dramatic works, but we believe it was preceded by a nunmber of farces to which he did not affix his name, and which were certainly not worthy of the oblivion to which he consigned them. It was followed by the RBmt Day, and these two works now stand as the classics of their respective kinds. That tendency which was exhibited by 3Mr. Jerrold through life to sympathize with the cause of the poor and lowly, and to launch his indignation against the oppresors in high plaaes, was plainly manifested in these earlier productions. The honest sailor who is sentenced to be hanged at the yardarm because he cannot brook an insult offered to his wife, and the honest farmer who is a most unworthy victim of the law of distress, represented those peculiar objects of sympvthy to which he adhered to the last. These two productions, Black-eyed Stsan and the Ren't Day, stamped him at once as the most popular dramatist of his time-as the writer, above all others, who could command the suffirages of the multitude. But, having secured the favour of the many, Mr. Jerrold now appealed to the " tastes" of the few. His Nel Gwvynne, perhaps the most delightful play he ever penned, presupposed a familiarity with the artificial tone that prevailed during the reign of Charles IL, though even here the sympathetic heart of the wrlter spoke through the sparkling dialogue of his personages. The Bousekeqper, a quiet picture of female love and devotion, with anhistoricalbackgroundfromthetime of George L, maybe ranked next In popularity to Black-eyed Susan and the Rent Day, and fourth in the series we mayplace the Prisoner of War, in which an anecdote of the English deten1s at Verdun was dramatized with a display of animal spirit in which the author in his later dramatic works was not wont to indulge. Several five-act comedies, among which Time works Wonders and Tle Bubbles of a Daay were most celebrated, were produced in the latter part of his dramatic career, but none of them obtained that permanent succes achieved by his former works. We shl not go too far if we designate Mr. Douglas Jerroldas the last of the truly English dramatists. :Not only did he refrain from that practice Qf adaptation from the French that now constius the chief vocation of the playwright, but he was altogether free from thatFrench inluence which may be discovered even in those of our writers who still dare to be orignaL Let us add that his antiGallicism was carried to a fanatical extreme, and that, while his dialogue showed a command over the English langauge which no wit of ancient or modern times could have excelled, his construction was frequently marked by that English laxity which a greater respect for French models might have corrected. But the " literature" of the drana was everything in the eyes of Douglas Jerrold, and all the mechanism by which " stage effect" is produced he regarded as meretricious and mischievous to the interests of dramatic art. Latterly the greatest literary triumphs of Mr. Jeirold have been achieved in the periodical publications of the da. The papers which he collected under the title o[ ' Cakles and Ale" are charming ebullitions of the fancy, ad the " Candle Lectures, which so accolerated the rising popularity of Punch, stand as specimens of minute life-painting that can scarcely be surpassed. At the time when these famous lectures were in course of publication there was not a hen-pecked husband in the lnited kingdom who did not snatch up Punch every week to contemplate his own misfortunes "cvetti in. sPeculo." For the last few years Mr. Jerrold was chiefly occupied as the Editor of Lloyd's WeeYmyNewspaper, and, by the custom of the English press, his own individuality could no longer be expressed as distinctly as in his earlier works. But there was one character in which Mr. Douglas Jerrold was always preeminent, and that was as the social wit. 3Marmontel said of Diderot that those who had read his works only, and had never heard him speak, could not form an estimate of his merits, and the same may be said of Douglas Jerrold. To conceive a brilliant and elaborate repartee was with him the work of a moment; nay, we could, if we would, cite cases, in which the cue was barely pronounced before the retort was fired off. The most novel combinations of ideas wera effected by him with electric rapidity, even an old pun could become new from his manner of uttering it, and, what was most wonderful of all, there was generally a deep truth couched at the bottom of his pleasantry, so that the joke, which had created a roar on its first utterance, actually appeared bitter when it became a subject of sober reflection. The sharpness of Mr. Jerrold's satire has caused many persons to attribute to him a character of misanthropic ill-nature; but never was a more egregious mistake committed. The large light blue eye of Douglas Jerrold beamed nothing but benevolence, and to this expression the feelin of his heart fully responded. Like alU wits, he loved his joke, and if an opportunity for uttering a repartee presented itself he was not the man to let the firelock escape his. grasp. Hence, some unfortunate personage who obtruded hiis egotism or his pedantry might chance to get an unlucky " hit" if Douglas Jerrold was in companiy, and as the weapon was of first rate quality the mark of the wotund might remain unobliterated for years. But, to suppose that Douglas Jerrold ever deliberately intended to inflict pain proves a total ignorance of his large and philanthropic nature. Wrong and oppression he hated in the abstract, but he had a friendly grasp for all individuals, even among his adversaries. The reading public, which knows celebrated men in black and white only, has lost a writer who for epigranmmatic brilliancy has never been excelled in our language. But far deeper has been the loss of tho circle of friends wvho delighted to spend whole evenings in catching the stream of wit as it floweed unimpeded fromrJerrold's lips, and acquired for themselves a reflected glory by repeating " Jerrold's last." The "wits" of London have lost their acknowledged chief. Mr. Dougla Jerrold died at Kilburn Priory in the arms of hs eldeet son, and retained his intellect till within a fewv minutes of his death.

M.

Two sontas of Beethoven-in G, Op. 29, and in A Op 109-Dnasseks in A flat, Op. 74 and some, movements from one of the Suit4s Anglaest (in G minor) by John Sebastian BAh, together itdi. smaller pieces by hi. Stephen Ha3ler and Chopin, made up the programme, which ws in all respects woithy the reputation Mi HaUe has long enjoyed as a most aoeom.- pUsh eprofemor, whose legitimate taste leads him to dedi. cate his talent exclusively to the highest order of music. The sonata in G of Beethoven (one of the boldest and mostindividual of that great master's earlier productions) wan. finelyperformed, the last two movemenis more especially; the rst (with deference to hL Ea16) would perhaps havemore entirely realized the intentions of. its eompoeer had it, been taken a shade faster (it is marked allegro titCe). Dussek's sonsta, one of its author's most anbitious and best, -known in France as c BJtour a Paris, and in Englan! as Plue [ltra (dedicated to Wbel's impudent Hie APts Ultra)-was doubly welcome. The *hole reading of tEis, with one exception, was irreproachable, and the exeution. to match. -The exoeption was in the movement describel by Dussek as "S&Aerzo quasi allegro," which X HaJl& took almost as slow as if it bAd beon one of the minuetof Hadyn or Mozart. When Dasek wrote his Bwour & Paris the example of Beethoven had exercised a stroug iBfluence upon him, and tnough too original a thinker to copy, he departed after his own manner hom thestereotyped models, and in the scherzo, as in the restof the sonata under notice, endeivoured to strikeout something new.

Ha6 had his reaons fortho view he adopted - but what these were is not dirsctlsy apparent. The grana sonata of Beethoven, Op. 109-one-ot the later series belonging to his so-called - third style,. rcently brought ao much Into vogue by Miss Arabelli Goddard, who played it twioe at her aoufes this year-wam the most arduous task of all, and the Danner in which it was performed by L .all6 entitled him to the warmest praise. Objection might possibly be taken to, certain points in his general oonception of this beautiful and romautic wrork-s, for example, that the middle move. ent, marked "( prtissimo,u was played scarcely psto, v,hil the variations were too uniformly given in the satict time of the the theme upon which they are based, althougla no two of them re alike; but an execntion so faultl%M, and so generally efFective may fairly claim exemption fron hypercritical remnarl- The Bach selecti"a was in everyrexpect capital-the Prelude (the most vigorous of its author, and the more remarale sinoe it pre. sents a fully developed example of that synphonio Praix which, in it5 extendtd form. is presumed to have beem invented by Haydn), the gavotte with Its museUe trioin themajor key, and the gigue being executed, one and all to. perection. The peludes and tarantella of Heler, th& tloturno and waltz of Chopin, were in light and pleasantoontrast to the more profound compositions we hba enumaerated. The whole concert, indeed, wa a genuine treat fore amateurs of good music; and AL HaWd's e6nfidenee in niij, own unaided powers to gratify an atdisnce of omnoM &rs (there were no vocal pieoes) Was amply jutified by the. n sult Rely has a performance of unj;oompanid piao-. forte music been listened to with mon e $er attentiw.
