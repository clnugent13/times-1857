This Company rests its claims to public support oni two plain coDnsiderations-let, that the steam companies alreadynavigating the rivers of India are realirig largo profits; and 2nd, that the vessls of this Company will by the aid of umprovements to which it haa the exctlusive right, be aDle to carry three or four times the quantity of cargo that can be carried by the vessels at presnt employed Cheap conveyance is necesary to India to enable the produce of the interior to reach the coost Of all known means Of COnveCyance, the cheapest is conveyance by water; aLnd railways, even when mads, cannot supersede the necessity of navigating the great rivers which Wil Still remain the gret arterie
of commerce, as has been found to be the case in Amaerica, and wheeres experience hasghown that railways and river co"veyance assist instead of opposing one another, The rivers of Indfa arie of vrst extent; they flow through the richest parts of thecountry; and they onyreQuire that ves3sel souldbheestablished upon tl.emwhich shal be capable or carrying a large cargo on a light draught of water to ensur results mnore, remunerative than in usual In commercial undertakings.'

The English In China.
THE ENGLISH IN OaRZN.
The following extractA from a letters dated Hong. kong, and describing the proceedings of the amiable objects of so much Parliamentary solicitude, will be read with interest:_
"Then Chinese, emboldened by their successful incen.' diauism in the foreign factories, have assumed offensive operatiorn, while the squadron, under the command of Admiral Seymour, being oomposed of vessels of large Size, has been unable to do mnore than maintain itB ground and keep open the communications with this colony. There appears to be no chance of the obstinacy of the mandaris giving way until the arrival of such a force as wi be able to act against them with effect. This the gunboats on the way hither are expected to afford, but in the meantime the entirepopulationseemsarming against foreigners without distinction, and some fearful hazards have marked the progress of the last month, acts of asassination having been frequent for the purpose of obtaining the head money offered by the provincial Govern. nient.
Jln 1s.-I am hardly able to hold my pen to write you a few Ies, being under the influence of a strong emetic taken to avoid the effects of poisoned bread eaten at this morning's breakfast. Mr. -, Mr. -, and myself were seized vith violent fits of vomiting immediately after leaving the table, and I have just beeni informed that the whole town has been more or less affected in the same way by bread baked by a Chinese shopman. We are so surrounded by the scoundrels that it is hardly possible to guard against their designs; and the atrocious blood-money edicts issued by the Canton Government have set on foot a svstem of assassination and kidnapping. How this state of things will end it is impossible to say; but, notwithstanding the injury to our interests, I cannot regret that the Canton people are at last about to meet their deserts. Trifling as was the original matter In dispute, the time must have come, sooner or later, when the humiliating position of foreigners could be no longer endured. At the other ports it is altogether different; the Cantor people are as much hated by the Northerners as foreigners are in the south, and the Shanghaimen openly express their satidaction at the action of our navy Whether this feeling will continue when they hear of our delay in enforcing terms I do not know.
"The exports of tea for the season will be 25,000,0001b. to 30,000,0001b. deficient."
Another letter, dated Hongkong, January 15, from which the following is an extract, states,-
" The baker from whom the poisoned bread was purchased is in custody, but it is feared that legal difficulties vril
prevent a conviction. My bread, fortunately, was baked the day before and toasted, so that we escaped the effects of the poison. Natives as well as Europeans hastened to the doctors, apparently in great pain. I mean to make my cook, a Chinamnan, taste everything in my presence before I partake of it."

:ae nommation of candidates took place yesterday at Lewes, the High Sheriff, Mr. R. C. Pomfret presidin.
Mr. R. W. BLxNcowx proposed and General DAVIS seconded the nomination of hMr. J. G. Dodson ; and Ir. E. Husszy proposed and Mr. W. V. L. SsrAwDL3L xe. conded the nomination of Viscount Pevensey.
Both candidates having addressed the electors, a show of hands was taken, which was in favour of Mr. Dodson by a considerable majority.
Mr. Husscy, on the part of Lord Pevensey, demanded a poll, which wll be opened on Thursday next.
NORTH LI;CESTERSHMIE ELECTION.
The election of a member to represent the Northern Division of the county of Leicester, vacant by the elevation of the Marquis of Granby to the peerage, took place at the Town-ball, Loughborough, yesterday.
Sir G. BEAuXoNT proposed and MÃ¯Â¿Â½r. H. C. BINcGx seconded the nomination of Lord John Manners.
Mr. FsRxwIc then addressed the electors, and said opposedthe election of Lord John Manners purely as
matter of princi le. Mr. Frewen, in conclusion, formally nominated the Mon. Major Henry Powys.
Mr. IL G. CsR wrELL seconded the proposal.
Mr. Prcs.WosTm, a draper of Loughborough, here stepped forward, and nominated Richard Cobden, Esq., amid cheers and much laughter.
Lord JoIsT rMAcis then addressed the electors. He said he should go to Parliament with the conviction that he was discharging his duty in maintaining to the best of his ability that fair fabric of tempered liberty which was called theirgloriousconstitution in Church and State. His Lordship then proceeded to review the foreign policy of the Government, and condemned the meddling interference with the quarrels of other nations. Their true policy, he said, was to avoid the extremes of either securing peace on terms dishonourable to the country, or plunging into war, except when absolutely necessary.
A show of hands was then taken, and, a majority being in favour of Major Powys, a poll was demanded for Lord John Manners, and, the proposers of the other candidates declintrng to press the matter to a contest, his Lordship briefly returned thanks and the proceedings terminated,

Sir,-As one of those mentioned in the account of the proceedings at Lord Eglinton's house on Friday last, which the Press newspaper bau pretended to give, and on which you have founded an article, I beg to inform you that the article in the Press newspaper contains an unauthorized distortion of the truth. You will not expect me to follow the example of the caterer from whom the Press newspaper has derived its matter, by violating the confidence of thoee with Whom I have been for some years politically connected; I must therefore content myself by thus endeavouring to disabuse you of the belief (if you ever entertained it) that the article in the Prees newspaper conveys a true version of what occurred between Lord Derby and his party on Friday last.
I have the honour to remain, Sir,

TO TEIJ EDITOR OP THE 7TIMN - x~~~~. I T
Sir,-I have watched with great imtereat Xi progress of the debatea inboth Houses of Parliment on nhinese affairs ; and the amount of piblic ittention which they have excited, as well as their poesible influence on our ftiture policy, induce me to think that you will not be indisposed to give aplace in your columns to a few obiervations on the subject. As one who has spent many years in China, and has had probably as extensive-opportunities of arriving at a correct judgment on the leadiDg features of our intercour-e with the Chinese and the.real character of the authorities and people, in all the various relations they sustain towards each other and to foreigners, as it is posible in the present state of affairs for an "outside Barbarian" to acquire, I venture to hope what I have to offer in the way of information may not be unacceptable to your readers, nor altogether without weight.
* I have often been struck, during my long residence in China, with the difficulty of conveying to those who have never had any personal acquaintancowith the Chinese, correct notions of the actual state of our relations or of the conditions which govern them. Our ideas, indeed, of the Chinese are as completely stereotyped among the English. nation as are those of the Chinese regarding us and Enropeans in general, and both are very nearly on a level for correctness; th,at is to say, there is sO large an admixture of error and fiction in both cases that what littleof truth has found its way into the national mind on either side only tends to give potency and circulation to the other ingredients. This tota ignorance and darkness, only " worse confounded" by glimpses of uncertain light, has been a great evil to both nations, and as I believe that no wrong is ever without a retributive penalty, even in this world, with a tendency to become cumulative, so is the British public now in danger of being misled, to our great peril,-tlbyr those who, for the political purposes of the hour, are disosed to make capital of the national ignorance. I listened to Lord Derby and Air. Cobden, successive nights, debating upon a thousand virtues in the Chinese Government. officials and people, and as many vices in the British authorities and merchants, with the feeling of one waking out of a dream, in which all the actual experienceof alifehadbeen socuriouslyandingeniously reveirsed that it required an effort to determine which was the dream and which the reality. Once released, however, fromthe speUlwhich somuch Parliamentary eloquence is calculated to fling over the most sober-minded, it becamne very evident that I had beenlistening to the powerful charge of special pleaders, whose business it was to make out a case, without much heed to what might be said on the other side. There are certain actions for breach of prormise of marriage often before our courts, where, as a matter of courge, the case is opened with an eloquent inventory of the virtues, the innocence, and long-suffering patience of the forlorn and much injured maiden, so incapable of committing a wrong, so worthy of all love and admiration, and then the gentlemen of the jury are caUled upon to look on the opposite of the picture,-a worthless, sordid, ad umfeeling fellow, one whose pleasure it is to outrage the best feelings of our nature, with no conscience or sense of shame in him. So, m the present instance, Yeh is the interesting and muchinjured victim, and Sir John Bowring is the unfortunate defendant. It is the fable of the wolf and the lamb over again, only the Celestial, by the sort of bizarre transposition familiar to us all in our dreams, is the unoffending lamb, and JohnBull, in the person of his representative and Government, is the ravenous wolf. Can this be all true ? At all events it behoves the British nation to ascertain whether it is so or not before they found any policy upon the assumptions of the opposite counsel, affecting as it must a Chinese and Indian annual trade of some 30,000,0001. sterling and a revenue of little less than 10,O00,)000L. setting aside the vested interests andthe character of a large class of British subjects, both official and mercantile. If Lord Derby and Mr. Cobden be correct in their view, the only poecy required-the only fitting policy to be followed in order to insure the most perfect harmony in our relations with and prosperity to our trade in China would be the transfusion of certain lamblike properties into our system,-truthfulness, patience, a submissive spirit, and incapability of taking offence. Let us glance through the period of our commercial relations with China, stretching over more than two centuries-a very cursory glance it must be, but that will suffice for there are malient events and facts enough of indisputable authenticity to bring out in clearest evidence either the truth or the fallacy of the views to which many, in both Houses, distinguished alike by position and political reputation, are giving currency with all the weight which naturaly attaches to such advantages. But first let it be observed that this policy now so vehemently advocated is not the inauguration of something new, but would suppose the feasibility of a return to that system which prevailed from the beginning, and was only abandoned as no longer tenable or fitted to attain the end in view when the war broke out consequent on the high-handed acts of Lin. This predecessor of the lamblike Yeh put a whole foreign community under durance, deprived them of servants and food, and put them in "a state of restraint, insult, and dark intimidation," which classed " the whole case among the most shameless violence3 which one nation has ever yet dared to perpetrate against another." The Earl of Albemarle, in the House of Lords, gave a very accurate summary of the leading evenfs marking the intercourse of the two centuries, when he said, "The Portuguese sent four separate missions, aU attended with insult and indignity ;" the first Envoy died in prison by the hands of the executioner after three years' incarceration. Spain Bent one mission with little better fortune. " The Ambassador of Philip IL and his suite were passed from prison to prison, and considered themselves lucky to leave the Celestial capital with a whole skin. The Envoys from Holland went prepared to conform to everything required by the Chinese." 'What was the result? "They were brought to the capital like malefactors, treated when there like beggars, and then sent back to Canton like mountebanks, to perform the three times three prostration at a times and before everything their conductors thought fit." Our own Ambassador, Lord Macartney, only escaped like indignities by his firmness in resisting. Lord Amherst narrowly escaped being hustled into the Imperial presence at - o'clock, the morning after he arrived, and being forced into prostrations. He was sent ignominiously away. Lord NaDier, with his hands tied by his instructions, obtained nothing but insults of the grossest kind, and finally was drummed out of Canton, and with gongs and tomtoms, in his last hours, escorted with contumely during a purposely prolonged journey of five days in the heat of summer, which cost him his life. So much for Envoys and the lamb-like treatment they met with. In trading relations thelessons are still more striking The first permission to trade restricted foreigners to the least convenient port, and the most distant in the empire from Pekin. At first lightly taxed, the extortions in the shape of customs, presents, and bribes gradually increased, and more than once attained such a pitch as to make trade no longer possible, and engender resistance in the long-enduring agents of the iast India Company-this resistance always leading to amelioration. Several times the trade was arbitrarily stopped by the Chinese local governors
or accidental homicides and more futilecausesin each case demanding a victim. The Americans gave up a man in 1821, on the express understanding that it should be a mere form, upon which he was immediately strangled and his dead body sent. back. A very similar case had occurred earlier, in 1784, witlhout avail-when an unfottunate gunner of the Lady Hlughes, given up under solemn guarantees for his life, was strangled without hesitation or mercy. Neither time nor space will permit the: bare enurneration of the various and successive interruptions to the trade on the part of the Chinese,
and the harassing and vexatious conditions imposed;* but one result stands clearly out. The only mea-
sure or limit to these was the forbearance of the foreigner; when this limit was overstepped and he had the courage to resist Gome redress or improvement always followed. Prom the first adventure of the fleet of Indiamen under-Captain Weddel in 1637, when on being threatened, after a favourable reception, ty the ariaing secretly of a fort abreast, "the whole fleet, being instantly incebsed, did on the sudden display their bIoody en-
sagns," and berthing theinselves, opposite the, forts in spite of a furious cannonade, effected a disembarcation and took it; after whic4 satisfaktory relations were established, until the Alceste and Lyra, in at-
tendance upon Lord 3 facartney, read them a mlar lesson with precisely the same result. The same

-o0 angliah einen f ' yh force as the sole a1t~riiative~,h :evErbee giowee by greAter e ezty and imuprn ed telUtion. It is m the face of these facts that the apealcers in favour of the motion JTeclre suchconiduct leads. to hostility and greater insecurity I Nor is the evidence limuted to events before the TreAty of NanIing. Either the exerciso of force or the evident determination to employ it, if all renlontracefailed, has alone placed anychecl on Chinese aggressiorn since. At Foochon, when the Tartan began to stone foreigners; at Shanghai, to mtret missionaries, or raise niots to cicmscribe our limits, or with an Imperial army to make armed descents into thesettlement, when a camp of 3,(0W was attacked by some Britsh and American seamen and marines from the men-of-war and utterly routed, not hotility or increased danger, but security and peace were the result, and the sole means bJz which either could have been attained. -or can it well be otherwise. The Emperor of China arroptes to himuelf to be in that capacity the sole representative of supreme power m the world. Hence the enunciation of the prineple by Too, the Viceroy at Canton, to Lord Napier, that "' Foreign devils 'ht write petitions,but they must not presume to send letters." Hence the pertinacity withwhich they still continue, mi all official correspondence and documents not meant for our eyes, to style us " barbarians ;" and the care with which the hostle and contumelious spirit of the Canton populace is tenderly nourishea and sustained by every successive Viceroy. Peki andCanton are thetwostrongholds ofthe retrograde policy, at the head of which, as he very plainly showed in 18t6 when he ascended the throne, the Ermperor himself stands pre-eminent. He has disgraced every officer who was known to bave an,y friendly feeling for or relations with us. To this day the manm that "the barbarians (and all foreigners are barbarians)sare likie beast, and not to be ruled on the sae principle as citizens," is the cherlahed mamo alwho wield authority in China. ;ubmission and forbearanee neverhavefailed tolead to greater arrogance, to vexatious measures, and to insecurity alile to life and property.. They respect in us only what they fear-superior courage or determination, themeans and the will, promptly and decidedly, to enforce our rights. Sir Charles Elliot only gave expression to the opinion that every resident and official ultimately acquires by a painful experience, when ho writes that "There can be neither safetynor honour till Her Majesty's flag flies on these coasts in a secure position." And thisl is the very question, ind the whole question, involved in the Arrow case. Yeh has perseveringly, and in spite of all warning, persisted in disregarding and refusingrespect to that flag when flying on any but a British built and manned vessel. He has been warned again and again that he incurred thegravest risks by such course. We claimed its a treaty right, and he only chose to contest it by acts of violence and insult. In this wr claimed an zcknowledged right among civilized nations-to decide for ourselves what vessels (of the class lorcha expressly specified in the treaty) should sail under the colours and pass of our nation, and that thus authorized by us she made a part of that country's navigation, and was in every respect liable to be considered as a vessel of the country; she is, as Lord Stowell has laid down, by all international law and usage so to be considered, as "bearing the national character of that nation under whose pass she sails." To allow any Chinese authority, then, to question or override her nationality, and disregard the immunities and privileges the national flag alike by treaty and the Jaw of nations confers is to invite agoression in ibs Worst and most insulting form, and way our whole trade and commerce in those seas at the mercy of men who have no respect for either law or treaties. It does not, as has been erroneously assumed, take Chinese subjects from under the jurisdiction of their own Govermment; but it imposes upon the authorities the obligation of abstaining from seizing them, when sailing under our flag, save by and through us. This obligation does not apply to FXance or America or any civilized State in their mutual relations by the law of nations, nor would it to China; but it does so by the express stipulations of the treaties intowhich she entered. There may be abuses under the Hongkong legislation, and a system of registration of which Yeh might justly complain and seek a remedy for, but his remedy does not lie in acti of violence and a high-handed disregard of treaty stipulations. On the contrary, as he has had experience at last, his own violence has been 'et by an appeal to force, for which he has to thank himself. Much has been said of the too ready recoursetoforceon our part, and of it beingunworthy of a civilized State. But has it not been forgotten that the Emperor of China, by his own voluntary act, places himself and his empire out of the comity of nations with alltheforeign Powerswhich have relations to maintain when he insists on continuing in an exceptional state by refusig all access to his Court to the representatives of those Powers-acondition made still further exceptional and intolerable by the fact that the Imperial Commissioner, whom he deleg,ates for the express purpose of furnishing the necessary means of communication and redress, when difficulties arise makes himself equally unapproachable, and, with the arrogance and conceit of a true barbarian, refuses all personal intercourse or ready access? What alternative is left in such a state of things but with a strong hand to enforce redress; and, since no certain or direct means of communication with either the Emperor or the ruling powers is vouchsafed, to speak in that language which is alone effective, or, indeed, intelligible to them ? On the Chinese themselves and their fanatic spirit of exclusion and restriction be the blame of such an untoward and abnormal state of affairs. It carries us back to those medioeval and still earlier ages when all negotiations between potentates were conducted from opposite camps. It compels us to be constantly under arms-not to extort new advantages, but to assert andmaintain those which have been guaranteed by treaty. It is vain to talk of Yeh's courtesy, patience, andforbearance, drawing such deductions from the studied politeness of his despatches. Very frequently there is a covert insult in his language which escapes one unacquainted with the Chinese character and customs - but when it is not so there is ever pervading all their documents what Guizot has termed, in speaking of Charles L, " Le vice d'une incurable duplicita" The Chinese are the Greeks of the Lower Em pire. The same mendacious, supple, yet braggradocio spirit forms the substratum. Merciless and faithless in dealing with the weak-, they are never to be trusted e-en by the strong, where the means of enforcing good faith are not at hand. All experience raay confidently be appealed to in confirmation of the truth of this estimate. As to the inhabitants of China generally, they have merely the distrust of foreigners and prejudice against them natural to a nation so ignorant of the rest of the world, so thoroughly isolated and so ill-tutored by thelr own rulers, whose policy it has ever been to represent us as wild beasts-devils without pretensions to reasonable treatment, and barbariansin every sense inferior to them. This falling in with the peculiarly arrogant and violent temper of the Cantonese has borne a full crop of bitter fruit, and so far it becomes a mnatter of national importance to humble thoee whose violence and hatred only increase with tolerance and forbearance. This condition of our relations when all access to the ruling powers is denied, and remonstrance that does not plainly rest upon the means of enforcing attention is utterly
unavaing and treated with eontempt, may not be agreeable or desirable; but it is the condition of
our commerce in the China Seas, and, so long as the
barriers of exclusion and restritions are maintained by the Chinese, so long shall we find it necessary either to give up the advantages of our commerce, or accept with them the obligation of upholding and asserting our treaty rights against all systematic and intentional aggression with the strong hand, and to intrust large powers of action at the moment to those charged-with the defence of our just rights, however severe the responsibility under which it
may be deemed necessary that these should be exercised. A delay of four or six months to a Chinese offcial is tohimn an eternity of impunity, and far beyond the limits of any salutary influence on his actions, as we shall find once more to our cost if in an evil hour Mr. Cobden should find the opportunity of redueing to pratice his uresent theori.

Earl GREY, in prewenting apetition condeumatoryof thi bombardment of Canton, and praying for the recsll of Sir J. Bowaing and Sr Ir. Stymour, wished to ask the preddent of the Council whether the war 4ow being waged was carried on for the purpose of obltining the adnission of the British Authorities into Canton, or for what other object? He also wished to know whether any reinforcements had been sent for, a dwhether such reinforoments had been ordered to to to Canton I
FA-1 GRANVILLE.-I have to state, with regard to tho intelligence from China, that no further oDerations have talen place, except thfose neoessiated by self-defence, but that the Chinese havo ofrered rewards for the assassination of British subjects and inoendariam in Canton. It is impossible to say that there is at the present time any prospect of an alteration in the stte of affairs that now exists. But at the same time there is no interruption'whatever of our commercial relations with the other four ports. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say that there is any change in our present position. It is absolutely necessary not only for our interests, bht for those of foreigners, that we should not appear to recede at Canton, as inconvenient results might foUow, not only there, but at the other four ports, where our relations are satisfactory. With regard to reinforcements, they have ben sent to IHongkong. One regiment ws sent three weeks ago.

In answer to Mr. Macartney, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he believed that the report of the Civil Service Commission would be laid npon the table before Easter. TEA AND SUGAR DUTEES. The CHANCELLOR of the EXOHEQUER took that opportunity of mentioning th»t since ho »nsircrcd the question of the right hon. member for Manchester with respect to the tea duties he had found that there wero no binding rules with regard to the order in which resolutions in Committee of Ways and Means came on, «nd he proposed, therefore, notwithstanding the resolution on the income-tax had been already read, to proceed first with the resolutions respecting the tea »nd sugar duties, as he was »ware tb»t those engaged In tho tea and sugar trados suffered great inconvenience from «ncertaintv as to the duties.

The loan would be applied in the «sual w»t, and part of it, therefore, would be devoted to pnbhc works. GUANO. Mr. E. DENISON wished to he infonnéd by the Sect«. tary of State for the Colonies whether an arrangement bad. been entered into between Her Majesty's Government aad those Liverpool merchante to- whom the Gu»no Islands oa the coast of Africa had been ceded, which, while it secured to the Utter a full «nd fair remuneration, would «uable the f armera of this country to obtain a supply of guano ! Mr. LABOUCHERE said, tbt what had occurred ¿nee he last addressed the House on the subject was this-th» parties who at present had exclusive licenses for taking guano from the isUnds in question had assured him that they wero ready to allow anybody to sake guano from the Wands npon payment ol V, per ton. He had reason to believe that that arrangement would be satisfactory to those parties who were apprehensive lhat the only consequence of the islands being ceded to those who aow had. the exclusive licenses wonld be to establish another guano monopoly. (Hear, hear.) It was the intention of the Government to afford to theso parties every practicable protection, through the instrumentality of the Government of Bomb»y, to enable them to fetch guano from the islands i and if, as seemed probable, it ihould happen that a very Urge quantity of guano should be obtained, and a great number of ships should be cmplojed in the transport of it ' it would be the desire of tho Government to »fford them permanent «nd efficient protection. (Hoar.) HOSTILITIES AGAINST ????. ADJOURNED DEBATE. ' The order of the day for the resumption of the debate on. this subject having been read, .Mr. R. PHILLIMOEE rose and said, that it hai beca »»?? generaUy admitted iu the «ourse of the debate that the great and momentous question which oecupled4he »ttention of the House was one that demanded in a grSai measure a just application and a true construction of the principles of international Uw. The study »nd practice ot that jurisprudence had occupied many years of his life, ana rt wis in the humble hope that he wight bring some contribution to the dehato by means of that study and practice that he ventured to claim for a short time the indulgent »ttention of the House. He fully eonourred in the opinion «pressed by tho Secretary of SUte for the Colonies, that thecharacterand credit of the British empire were involved· m this question, andthat it would be unbecoming in the House of Commons not to pass « deliberate judgment upon the recent transactions »t Canton. There had been meetings of rival poUtical chiefs, in reference to this debate, but hehadnot»ttendod »nyof them, because he thought that his voto on such a question as that now before the House ought not to bo influenced ia the «lightest degreeby any poUtical or party considerations. (Hear, hear.) Certain extraneous elements, calcuUted to lead the House astray instead of guiding it to a right conclusion, had been introduced into the debate. Theyh»d tho blue-book with. the memorable misnomer of " Insults in China." Those who had read that document would knowhow little it deserved its appeUation. The very last pages of that book recorded the case of » missionary named Burns, who, having put oa the dress of a Chinese and gone into the forbidden towns, was seized by the Chinese authorities, and afterwards demanded by the British Consul. The Chineso authoritíes compUÍned in the correspondence of the conduct ? Mr-,Bura^> bttt promised that he should bo taken care of; «nd when he was restored that gentleman expressed himself very grateful for the kind treatment he had reeeived. In th»t debate, however, they had nothing to do with the general character of the Chinese. (Hear, hear.)· The Lord-Advocate had read an extract from the wort of M. Hue, a French missionary, to the effect that theChinese must be " bent down like a bamboo-cane and held fast;' otherwise we could not de»l with thematatalL Now, the work of Mr. Meadows, the Chinese interpreter to· « ?ro,wn> contained this remarkable passage-" that of all books the one most to be distrusted is the account of Chins given by M. Hue." Again, the question as toour nght to enter Canton, and whether the treaties on that subject had been violated, had nothing to do with that discussion except so faras they affected the bonafides ot the lorcha dispute. The Attorney-General, in speaking of Sir 3. Bowring being «tabbed in the back by his friends, had misrepresented-unintentionally no doubt-what fell from the nght hon. baronetebelow him (Sir J. Graham). The nght hpn. baronet spoke in high terms, »s everybody mustdo, of Admiral Seymour, and stated distinctly, at the sune time, that he h»d no acquaintance, beyond a House of Com· mons" one, with Sir J. Bowring. No hon. member's vote, therefore, ought to bo influenced by a feeling that they were censuring Admiral Seymour, who had had nothing els« to do but to follow the orders of tho Plenipotentiary. The real question beforo the House was this, ""Was the war just in its ongin or right in its continuance ! Aad if not. wh»t verdict ought «British House ?-Commons to pass upon it ? The papers on the table contained »n «ddress irom the inhabitants of Canton to his Exoellency the Plenipotenti»ry, which w*s one of tho most touching documents ever presented to a deliberative assembly. That address stated: - '! We! *n,e Cantonese, who have been born and brought up in this pl*ce, some of us in the public service, some of us m trade, whatever our vocation, have each one and all our property, our very food »nd raiment in this city, and to all ot us, hundreds of thousands in number, the city is our baso and our foundation. Your nation has traded at Canton for more than a century, during which it may be said that between yon and ourselves, tho Cantonese, there have been relations of friendship, and not of hostility. The late affair: of the lorcha was a trifle-it was no case for deep-seated animosity, as a great offence that could not be forcotten ?' yet yon have suddenly taken up arms, and for several davi jou have been finng shell until you have burnt dwellings "HS offrojed people in untold numbers. It cannot be either told how many old people, infants, «nd women have left their homes in affliction. H your countrymen have notseen this thoyhave surely heard, have they not, that such is tho case? What offence has been committed by the people of Canton that such »caUmity should befall them?' He asked the Houso of Commons what answer they could make to this question! It could receive only one of two answers,-viz., either that they entirely approved, like Lord Clarendon and the rest of the Government, the course »dopted by Sir J. Bowring, Consul Pukes, »nd Admiral Seymour: or that they concurred with the hon. member forthe West; Riding in. asserting that the papers on the table failed to establish any satisfactory grounds for the violent measures taken in the case of the Arrow. The first proposition he would lay down was that, whatever the principles of international law were, they were *Ä. ;??11???1? to China as to «ny other country. «|?5?? ??????»*? had alleged, indeed, that China was not entitled to bo put into the category of nations whioh could be dealt with «ccordmg to strict international law: but if such language had been held by Russia towards Turkey it would have provoked indignant disclaimers from all parts of tte House. (Hear, hear.) The despatches of Commissioner r eh gave a better exposition of the principles of international Uw thanjrho was ashamed to say, conld be found in the letters of the British Plenipotentiary. Governor Teh said :- . !' ? reference to this matter, who is in the right and who ie ? the wrong, »11 countries must h»ve principles of justice by which to decide. Wh»t reason is there in thus disturbing the quiet of the people of all countries Î" Had we not treaties with Chin» recognizing her police and h· r courts of justice! Was there any ground by whioh we could mete out »different measure of intcrnationalUw »nd justice to Turkey »nd to aiinaî There was, it was true, a distinctioR as to comity between Christian and heathen nations; but in »? nmtters between State »nd State it was »n unquestionable proposition that Chin» most be dealt with on the principles of international law. What, then, was the national character of tho Arrow, and how must it be ascertained l Either by tho English Uw,'by International Uw. or by the specific provisions of tho treaty. The House conld not have failed to observe tho different Unes of armiment taken by the Socretary of Stale for tho Colonies and by the Attorney:General. The f ormer rested the case mainly on the colonial ordinance ; whüe the Utter held that the Whole question, depended on the construction of the treaty, »nd that with tho colonial ordinance it had nothing whatever to ?°VTh.e,(l?lonl*1SecKt,trUkene*the colonial ordinanceto the Mediterranean passes : but there was no analogy between the two. The Mediterrenean passes were çivin to protect Christian common» «gainst the Barbary corskirs ; but then they were given by means of treaties with those very Barbary corsairs. This colonUl r :din»nce, on the other hand, was not »treaty between EngUnd »nd China. lo put it on an equal footing with tho Mediterranean passes it must rest on treaty. Therefore tho doctrineassertedelsewhere, that it was not possible for England, by any manieipal Uw she might enact, to take »way the rights of other countnes, remained wholly unshaken by the discussion in this Honse. With regard to the question whether the flaeof the loreh» was up »t the time of the seizure, he did not believe that «ny judge or jury, with suoh conflicting evidence beforo them »s existed on this point, wonld ????? hv the conclusion that the British flag was fly^. ItTould also bo remembered that Governor Yeh hid ¿ver and over »gain said that it was not the custom of Iqrchas to carryihe British flag when »t anchor.

Besides, this argument as to the treaty being everything, and all things else nothing, went too far, lor ? the treaty was everything and the colonial ordinance nothing, why was that ordinance passed at all ? Let them, however, assures «jat the Attorney-General's interpretation was correct,-and they must then fall back upon international law to decide what was a British ship. According to thst law a British ship was one which had proper British papers, but by the statements of Sir J. Bowring himself it appeared ttat this lorcha had not and could not have had such papers. Therefore, however the words "British vessel" were interpreted, whether by our own statutes or by general international law, it was clear that no wrong had been done by the Chinese. The hon. and learned Attorney-General had further argued, and had cited oases in support oí his arenment, that if this ship had been owned by a domiciled Bntish subjeot it wonld have been a British ship. The cases cited from the " Admiralty Reports" only went to establish that in time of war-and it was toa time of war only that they ref erred-ships were to be judged according to the flags at their mastheads-an elementary proposition which no one would dispute. (Hear.) The cases cited from the "Common Law Reports" wonld no doubt be dealt with by other hon. members ia the course of the debate, and he would pass them by with this observation, that even if the ion. and learned gentîeman's position were a sound one, there was no evidence that the owner of this vessel was a domiciled British subject. Onthe contrary, it appeared from these papers that if domiciled anywhere he was domiciled at Canton. But even if he were domiciled in a British possession, such domicile, although of force against third parties, could not avail him against the country of his allegiance. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Phillimore) hastened from these l»gal questions, with which, however, he trusted he had not weaned the Houso (hear, hear), to that which was more properly a question of a moral character. Assuming that the British authorities were right in everything which they did with respect to this vessel, assuming that she was a British vessel duly registered, let the House look at the disproportion between the ofl'eace and the chastisement! (Hear, hear.) Was the law of nations really so stupid and Eo detestable a code that it exacted the blood of men as satisfaction for an offence of this description? Did it point at no intermedUte step? What was the intermediate course which the Queen's Advocate recommended ? Reprisals ; and what was the difference between reprisals and war? Reprisals wero made wanmte .pace, bot war introduced a totally different state of things, and he ventured to say that reprisals and not war were the proper remedy for the wrong whic!* was alleged to have been committed. (Hear, hear.) He contended abo that the papers before the Honse showed that full satisfaction had been afforded, and that it was indefensible upsn any principle of law, of justice, or of humanity to make war for the punishment of a nation apart from reparation. He begged attention to an authority upon this point, which would not be disputed. In«the famous answer to the Prussian memorial, which Montesquieu Eaid was never replied to, this passage occurred :- "The law of nations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience, and the reason of the thing, and confirmed by long usage, does not allow of reprisals except in case of violent injuries, directed or supported by the State, and justice absolutely denied in re minime dubia by all the tribunals. and t f terwards by the prince." The question arose, then, was this a violence supported by tte State, and for which all reparation had been denied » The Attorney-General had deprecated the attacks made upon Sir J. Bowring for not understanding a question of law respecting which Lord Lyndhurst and Lord Wensleydale were at variance ; but did the House reflect upon the position of the Chinese? (Hear, hear.) If the point of law was so doubtful that the most eminent Uwyers of EngUnd differed in fopinion as to its construction, in God's name, and hi the name of humanity, why was Canton bombarded ? He contended that in this case the res was not only duoio, but that it was mininfa, and that the proceeding was indefensible upon any principle. What were the admitted facts of the case? Here was a Chinese built, » Chítese bought, and a Chinese owned vessel, having a pirate on board, without a register cognizable by the English courte of justice, and with a British flag which had .been purchased for $1,000. She was boarded by the Chinese anthonties, who took off ten of the crew, but neither touched the property in the ship nor injured any of the peisons who were on board. (Hear, hear.) Now, one of the false statemi nts reiterated by Consul Parkes was that the master was on board at the timelthis proceeding took place, when in fact he was not on board. What reparation was made for this insult? Tho men were sent back under the escort of a high Chinese magistrate, and Teh had dec,.í? ?^er !md over again tn»t he never intended the slightest insult to the English flag, and that he had no idei that the lorcha was an English vessel. Was this, then, a rase justifying reprisals ? Oa the 13th of October, 18Õ6, Sir d. .Bowring wrote to Consul Parkes in these terms :- a "Î? íeply to your «fcspatcb of the 12th inst., it is undoubtedly my intention that the apology of the Imperial Commissioner shall be in writing; and the requirement that the conditions of the treaty be strictly fulfuTed necessarily -mplies the return of the arrested Chinamen to the ship, and their delivery to the authorities (if deUvered) by and through you. As to the modus faciendi, I shall leave tlat to be arranged by the Commodore and yourself." At that time, therefore, Sir J. Bowring did not think that ÎS 5£n ihoj"d be returned in any particular manner. On tne ¿¿i of·October Con.ul Parkes wrote to Admiral SoyCommi · *1 reived this statement from the Imperial " Hereafter, if any Uwless characters conceal themselves on board foreign lorchas you, the said consul, shall, of course. be mf ormed of the same by declaration (from the Imperial Commissioner), in order that von may act in conjunction .wrth the Chinese authonties in the management of such Upon that statement Mr. Parkes observed, "This may, perhaps, be considered a sufficient assurance." On the 12th $2«?!??% ??' ?°? ^OIS ? Sir J. Bowring, stating that the assistant-magistrate Hew had been sent twice with tbe men to be surrendered, and he added :__ ?»«^8]01?16 Anr toei*0 business that has had to be transacted by deputy has been transacted by officers similarly deputed, and the present was a case of all others «quiring common conference ; but Consul Parkes had made aphis mind not to consent to what was proposed. . .

I must beg your Excellency to pass an opmion on such a state of things." He (Mr. Phillimore) now· asked the House of Commons to pass an ?????? on such a state of things." (Cheew.) In page ? of the proceedbgs there was a document most damning to the British cause. He referred to the minutes of a conference with some of the Caatoa gentry, dated SSStW h' mã\ ??? r^PKÇ. Cinese gintlemen nrgedtbat it would be better to detach the intercourse question ftom tne Arrow case, but the minutes said :- "If simple reparation f or outrage in the Arrow case had been all we required .the Admiral would doubtless have been long ago satisfied with what had been done (cheers) ; but doneda"PmiC1P WaS at Stake Which oonld "ot ??????(Renewed cheers.) He (Mr. Phillimore)asked whether any rtll-li-T^ íontendtbat reprisals were justified when 2Í° nhadbeen made ? But it appeared, according to the wnnAÎwithVa^wh05e?aB^drePrisa)s. *?? they would doubtless have been satisfied long before if ??????Uçn for outrage in the case of the Arrow had been affiat wasrecraired. The proposition of the hon. member for the West Ridmg was that the punishment inflicted upon Canton was more than adequate to the outrage upon the Arrow, and the official of this country declared Æatii factory reparation for that outrage had been given long a»o. ?£(??? ?hüJjmoxe) n°w came to a portion of the else which had been dexterously handled by the AttorneyCeneral, who referred to Lord Clarendon's letter containing the opmion of the Queen's Advocate, an officer, as the hon. and learned gentleman remarked, who was appointed by Lord Derby. He (Mr. Phillimore) thonght, however, it was evident from the opinion that tho real facts of the case were not before the Queen's Advocate. 'Was that learned functionary in favour of going to war? No such thing. He said at page 16,?."

Chmese authorities in boarding a lorcha which had been a pirate, and which was Chinese manned and Chinese owned, had intended to insult us ? (Hear, hear.) Commissioner Teh denied over »nd over again that such was his intention ; he promised that tbe utmost care should be taken that nothing of the sort should occur again, and he sent back every man who had beea takea oat of the lorcha, including the pirate ; and jet the British plenipotentiary, being of opinion that the honour of his countrywasnotsafficientlyappeased, empowered the admiral to bombard one of the most populous cities in the world. He could not accept the benevolent suggestion of the Colomal Secretary, that we were not at war with China, for at natro 46 he found Sir John Bowring thus writing to the niennna* · __ pago Commissioner . . "?.T11^ iiowleave to his Excellency the naval commanderin-chief the measures which » painful necessity may compel him to take, andto your Excellency all the responsibiUty which belongs to those who disregard treaties, and visit upon a people the unhappy consequences of their own obstinacy. I shaU not fail to advise the Court of Pekin of the needless misenes your Excellency has brought upon this city and neighbourhood, »11 of which might easily have· been averted." Soon" after the admiral thus wrote to Yeh :- " That the city now Uy at his mercy, and could be destroyed without difficulty, if any cause should impose npon the admiral so sad a necessity." He had abstained so far from quoting any authorities for the propositions which he had advanced ; but he could not resist readmg to the House a passage from Lord Bacon, in wbch that great man laid down the cauees which justified a war:- "As the cause of a war ought to be just, so the justice of that cause ought to be evident, not obscure, not scrupulous. Por by the consent of all Uws, in capital cases, the evidence must be full and clear ; and if so where one man's life is in question, what say we to a war which is ever the sentence of death upon many ?" (Loud cheers.) Was the evidence in this case, which had dmded the learned judges in the House of Lords, so devoid of obscurity as to entitle the House of Commons to justify Üiat which was a " sentence of death upon many ? (Hear, hear.) I£ it was not, then it was impossible to »void voting for this motion. (Hear, hear.) On reading these words he could not help reflecting that there was in another pUce an rader of mea whose peculiar mission it was to proclaim 'peace upon earth." (Loud and continued cheering.) By the ecclesiastical Uw, and by the rules of their own House, the nght rev. prelates were not allowed to vote upon questions oi blood, where the life of one man was at stake. At the taal of Lord Cardigan they all retired from the House in a body, refusing to interfere in a matter of blood, and where, then, did they find their justification for voting this sentence of death npon many? (Hear, hear.) He should five his cordial support to the motion, »nd in the name of umanity and of the eternal principles of justice he pronounced this war to have been in its origin unjust »nd unblessed in its continuance. (Hear, hear. ) Sir G. GRET.-I »m anxious, Sir, in the few words which I have to »ddress to the Houso not to go over the ground which has already been occupied by other hon. members who have preceded me, and I can assure the House that I shall not attempt to touch upon the legal part of the question, which I am quite ready to rest upon the able, lucid, and convincing speech of my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General. (Hear, hear.) Neither do I rise for the purpose of questioning the motives which have influenced the votes of any member of the other House of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) I cannot admire the taste dispUyed by the hon. gentleman, who, I believe, rather prides himself apoa the support which he extends to the established church, in thus appealing to the Houso of Commons against a vote given by the prelates of the church in the House of Lords, not acting in a judioial, but in a legisUtive capacity. The hon. and learned gentleman says that because this is a question of blood the right rev. preUtes ought to havo withdrawn, but he forgets that "the noble earl who introduced the motion was so far from thinking that this was a matter in which the spiritual peers, to whom the hon. and learned member has made this in. decent allusion, ought not to interfere, that at the close of his powerfuli and able speech he addressed to them a stirring exhortation in the name of humanity, ofthat Christianity of which they are the legitimate defenders, to show by thenvotes the sense which they entertained of the proceedings of our authorities in China. They obeyed his appeal, exer cising an undoubted privilege and acting in accordance with every precedent, and because, after hearing all the arguments which were addressed to that House on both sides of the question, their votes augmented that maj'onty which has given such great dissatisfaction to the hon. and learned gentleman, they »re now exposed to his severe censare aad reprobation Dealing alone with the facte of the case, I shall make a few observations on what has fallen from right hon. aad hon. gentlemea in the course of the debate, for I am bound to say that the representations made by more than one sup. porter of the motion of the hon. member for the Wes Riding have had the effect of giving a very incorrect view of the case. I have already said, I shall not enter into the egal discussion of the question. I wffl only say I am glad to find from the course taken by the hon. »nd learned gentleman who Ust addressed the House that we are no longer asked to argue the case on the broad ground Uid down in the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding-that there was not a shadow of Uw for our proceodiags against he Chinese. (Hear.) I had thought that the House of Commons .was called apon to say whether we had or had not acted in accordance with Uw, when it was asked to give its support to the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding, founded as that motion is on the assumption that there was no shadow of Uw for our proceedings in China. (Hear.) Bat, passing bom that, let] me «sk how this case has been met ? It has been met as if the vessel seized by the Chmese authorities was without doubt a Chinese vessel sailing nader Chinese colours, and that in boarding it they acted in perfect innocence of all intention to commit a wrong, and in the exercise of an undoubted right; that in short, they boarded the ship without the slightest suspicion that it had «ny pretensions to the character of t ^V®^1· (Hear' hear-> 0ne hon- gentleman has told the House that he fully believes Commissionor Yeh when he said he had ao idea that it was * British ship Now, aaybody at all conversant with the state of trado as earned on in those waterslknows that these lorchas are not all Chinese vessels-that some of them sail under the British flag, some under the Portuguese flag, and the flags of other nations, and some under the flag of China, and that under the protection of different nations they are carrying on an extensive trade. Ceasul Parkes says only the truth when he states that .in consequence of this state of things these proceedings assume a most important character and object not bemg limited ia their resalta to the particuUr case out of which they have arisen, but affectinga Urge and numerous class of vessels engaged in trade ia that part of the world.

(Hear, hear.) lithe event of a Bntish vessel being charged with piratical practices Consul Parkos would m the discharge of his duty, have called on the Chinese authorities to proceed against it The letter of Sir John Bowring to Consul Parkes, dated Oct. 11 1856, shows the course that was generally followed in such cases. He says,"Son wül add that on »nysufficientevidence beinggiveñ that Bntish ships or British subjects have been engaged in piratical practices they will he proceeded »gainst without heatation; andthat, on application to the proper authority, Chinese offenders will not be harboured on board Bntaih vessels, but that «U proceedings must take place according to the conditions of the treaty."

Mr. COBDErT.-I beg the righthon. gentleman's pardon. i dia say a great deal about it. I said as much of Mr. Cook's opinion against the Chinese as he says himself in that letter, aad I thiak rather more. (Hear, hear.) Sir G.

(????, hear.) At »11 events, Mr. Cook himself believes that the impression made upon the public mind by the hon. member for the west Kidmg is one calculated to subject him to misrepresentation and misconception, aad, in order to avoid the possibility of that, he has published in the pnblic jouraaU the letter which I am about to read. After the passage quoted by the hon. member, Mr. Cook says :- ? ·?5* *5 "S*"33 the present tronbles, to prevent »ny mis?? *1???5?8 of ?? views, I wish to express my opinion, that the dnty of the home Government to support the servants of the Crown engaged inchinato the fullest extent shonld not be called in question for a moment, or until a satisfactory termination of the present difficulties, »t least ; tor in case of a suspension of hostilities by the Government it would be an impossibility for Europeans to live in the yicinity of Canton, and no amount of negotiations could alter it for the better. Anyone who has lived among the Chinese can testify to the continued insults »nd injuries heaped upoB foreigners whenever an opportunity offers, »nd the studied contempt shown on all occasions, superinduced by feelings of superiority entertained by the Cantonese in contradistinction to all the other ports in China, all of which has been brought about by the previous settlement made with them, or, in other words, the want of an application of Physical power to convince them of their position ; »nd, although we are pecuniary sufferers to a very great extent in conséquence of these troubles, we should prefer to suffer still more than see any settlement which did not involve the necessity of the (Chinese realizing their position, »nd » sufficient guarantee for the Hberty and safety of foreign residents while »mong them. My p»rticul»r reasons f or these views have been acquired by a long aad very close Intimacy with them, and, of course, cannot be condensed in a note of this kind." (Cheers.) Haying read that letter, I must ?»y that I cannot agree with the hon. member for the West Riding ttat m stating that Mr. Cook was as «ntiChraese as it was possible f or him to be, he said all that he ought to have said, or did full justace to the views and opinions of Mr. Cook, founded as they are upon long experience of the character and disposition ofthe Chmese. (Hear, hear.) There are two other ^ífÍñ ? í?° speech of the hon. member to which I wish to caU the attention of the House. It will be recollected that the hon. member brought a compUint against the Government that they had played a trick upon the House, and attempted to mystify it by the production, immediately before the debate upon his motion, of a blue-book, entitled Correspondence respecting Insults in Chin»," Recurring to a practice which was much resorted to gome time »goT the hon. member addressed himself to hon. "gentlemen oppo. site, calling them "plain, simple-minded country gentlemen, _ and representing them as saying « Mercy on us 1 Here is a book of 225 pages, all about the insults we have suffered in China. It is high time that Lord Clarendon should interfere for the protection of British interests, and ltis quite nght to go to war on the subject, if necessary." (.Hear, hear.) Now, what are the facts of the case? A noble lord in another place-I mean Lord Grey-who has taker? a^very great interest in this question, »nd for whom i entortam, both on public and private grounds, the greatest esteem and affection ; a noble lord, moreover? who agrees with the hon. member for the West Riding in his views rirau this subject, and who has spoken »bly in the other House ? that sense; bat a noble lord, let me add who never seeks to support any cause by the suppression oí facts, moved an address for the presentation of papers relating to China, »knowledgeof which, hebeUevedVwould be conducive to the pubUc interests. I hold in my hands tbe terms of that motion, which was submitted before the debate came on, exteaoted from the journals of the House of Lords. It is headed " Correspondence respecting Insults in China," and runs »s follows:" Copies or extracts of any reports made to Her Majesty's Government of insults offered by British residents »t canton to natives of that place, giace the conclusion of the treaty of peace between this country and China ia 1842 · also of »ny reports of insults offered by Chinese to foreigners." (Hear, hear.) In answer to that address, and under the same heading, we produced the papers referred to by the hon. member for the West Riding. The House will see, therefore, that the Government were not the first to move in toe matter, hat that, on the contrary, we were willing to meet in tho other Houso a resolution, Knot the s»me in terms, at least identical in purpose and effect with that which we »re now discussing, without the production of documents which the hon. member says wo have published with » view to mystify Parliament and the country. (Hear, hear.) I think the House wül agree with me, after what I have said, that the mystifica??* ,^r' has teen on the part of the hon. member himself. (Cheers.) Agaia-»nd thb is the secoad point to .which I wish to refer-the hon. member ??? sneered at the character, acquirements, and experience of Mr. Consul Parker, I must say, indeed, that amain object of most of the speeche s which have been delivered in this House in support of the motion has been to run down everybody concerned for as m China. (Cheers.) All our authorities, however able and yalu*ble may have been their services, have been held up to ndicule, contempt, and scorn. What, for example, ??? tte hon. member for the West Riding said of Mr. Parkes ? He told the House to contrast the correspondence of Commissioner Yeh, » gentleman for whom he seems to entertain tfe highest respect (a Uugh), with that of Mr. Parkes, a cleii ¥.,.*? o®06» * yonng m»n "«ho might possess some abilities, but who was entirely deficient in the expenence and discretion which were necessary for the conduct of the important »flairs iatrusted to him in China, buch an official, said the hon. member, so yonng and inexpenenced, was not able to deal with aa Imperiai Commissioner, a Cabinet Minister,-I am glad to find he has some respect for Cabinet Ministers (a laugh),-a man who had gone through all the grades of civil employment. Now, I do not intend to go into the biography of Mr. P»rkes, but I v v.? ?*, , mo,a short notice of his pnblic services which I shaU take the Uberty of reading to the House. I find that Mr. Parkes was "Attached to Sir H. Pottingers suite ln June, 1842 i »cted as interpreter at Foo-chow-foo, 1845-46; acted as inter gf" rhaÍSba£ 184(HK; «pointed 'interpreter »t Shanghai Apnl 1848; appointed laterpreter at Amoyin 18«; sent to Formosa to distnbute rewards to Chinese in ;^lÂSS7ea«*s ^tenn-eter at Canton in 1851; appointed SSELÎ ^?0?· ^"??854* accompanied Sir J. Bowring to Siam m March, 1855 ; arrived ia^gland with fSlTjft'7' ?? «toned with ratifications; January, 1856 ; took charge of Canton Consulate, June, 1856." (Cheers.) It wffl thus be seen ttat Mr. Parkes has raided himself, by his character and abilities, to »position of considerable importance, and if the hon. member for the West Kiding, when he called him a clerk in an office, referred to his connexion with Sir Henry Pottinger, ?? t have to say is that he served an apprenticeship eminently fitted to ' qualify hrm for his present duties. (Hear, hear.) At the same time I am bound to state that I think the hon. member should be tho last to disparage any man who by talent and integrity has elevated himielf toan honourable position ?*? ? *"£?, t° attempt to sneer him down by calling him a clerk. (Cheers.) Such, however, is a specimen of the fairness of tho statements made with regard to our consular agents by gentlemen who ought to sympathize with them. But the depreciation of the hon. member did not end here. ,-?? extended his attack to the British merchants in Chin», and, indeed, all over the world. It is not necessary for me, however, to answer that part of his speech, which has been already sufficiently handled by the hon. members for ; Lancaster and Liverpool. I do not beheve "that what he said will have any effect either in or , out of this House, or that the character of English merchants will be judged at home or abroad bv 'the portrait which he has" drawn of them, ffiea? }-l*\ ?? ^thregardto Sir J.Bowring Imustsaythat there has_been a torrent of invective and sarcasm directed »gainst him wbch has both pamed and astonished me. considernigue quarters from.which it has principally proceeded. (Cheers.) Amid the storm of obloquy anareproach. which has raged now for nearly a week, only one Vcoér ition, as f»r as I tan remember, has been mad· 'Ä.the wholesale condemnation of our »uthorities in China. 'That exception is Sir Michael Seymour; Against ?that distinguished officer no member of this Househasraised :hisvoiee, «xpept » gallant; »amiral (Sir Thomas Herbert), who I should have thought wonld hare beea the first-to sympathize with a. brother officer when placed in eircum'stances of great difficulty.

nag. It was with pain that I hoard the noble lord the member for the eity, at the close of his speech «Ilude Jo Sir J. Bowring ?? a troublesome, meddla aomeoffioiai. (Cheers and Uughter from the Opposition. ?FoUowing in the same strain, but improving upon it, the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle told us that ha had sat f or a long time in this Honse with Sir J. Bowring and hw consequently enjoyed many opportunities of bo coming acquainted with his real character. He said tha Srr John was » man of strong opinions, and, » I nnderstood the meaning of his words, totally desti tnte of judgment. (Cheers from the Opposition.) Then with th»t peculiar bUndness which characterizes al ha speeches (» Uugh), bnt also with great delibera tion and gravity, the right hon. baronet «aid that the responsibility of selecting him for the important office which he holds in China was » serious responsibility By whom -was that responsibility incurred ? Vly noble fnend knew Sir J. Bownag better perhaps than the right non. gentleman did, for in times of close political conflic he was among those who had followed his standard. They were intimately »ssocUted in political life, and my noble friend knew his character and his faults. We all have our faults, andthoee of Sir J. Bowring perhaps »re oa tho snrface. (Hear, hear.) WeU, who »ppointed Sir J. Bow nng? I find that he was »ppointed Consul at Canton on the 10th of January, 1849, my nobis friend the member for London being then »t the head of the Government (Cheers.) He held that office for sometime : and I presame that the Government h»d no xeaason to be dissatisfied with the modo in which ha discharged the duties of his office for I find that on the 24th of December, 1853, he was ap pointed plenipotentiary and thief superintendent of trade at Canton by the Government over which the Earl o Aberdeen presided, and of which both my noble friend and the tight bon. gentleman the member for Car lisle were members. (Cheers.) The right hon. gen tleman now knows on whom the responsibility of the appointment rests; and he must forgive m for saying that this is not the first occasion in hi public life on which he has thought too late of the responsi bility of «cts eommitted. (Cheers.) I have said that Sir J Bowring had his faults, and that they were on tho surface bat I shonld not do him justice if I were not to say that h possessed great zeal in thepublic service, very great ability and great humanity ; andlbelieve that there is no gentle man conversant with Chinese affairs who will not say tha all his prepossessions are in favour of China, such bein the impression which was derived also by my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General from the perusal of tho papers which had been officially submitted to him. Sir J Bowring has no right to favour from those who concurred in his appointment, but he hasa right to justice, and from th right hon. gentleman the member for Carlisle he has no received the shadow of it. I need not go, I »m sorry t say, beyond the minutes of thi3 debate for evidenc that long political association!, the memory o many years spent in office together, and the dis charge of those duties involving great matu»l cares anxieties, and responsibilities, do not mitigate the tone o censure in which the acts of the Government are sometime reviewed. (Hear, hear.) These recollections, however, d not tend to suggest any very favourable construction of th motives of those who bring them to our mind. I am no surprised, therefore, that Sir J. Bowring shoald have me with no favour from those to whom he might have beea in debted for his appointment from » frillknowledge of hi character ; but I repeat thathe was entitled to justice, »a that justice, I think I shall be enabled to show, he has no received. My noble friend the member for London had right, of course, to express himself as he did with regard t Sir J. Bowring-and let it not be supposed that I »m en deavouring for a moment to restrict the right of any hon member to express his feelings npon public men aad publi events as freely »nd as energetically as he pleases-but m noble friend's speech rather exceeded ia the severity of it censure the speech of the hon. »nd learned member for Ennis killen, with whom I never had any political reUtions. (A Uugh.) Painful, however, as th»t speech was to some of u who heard it-not so much forthe sentiment conveyed i it as from the tone-I give him credit for that honesty o purpose and that depth of conviction which I know influ ence every action of his life. I wish that I could say a much-and I would gladly if I could-for the right hon gentleman tho member for Carlisle (» Uugh) ; but I mns say the whole speech of the light hon. gentleman resolve itself into »n ungenerous and unjust attack upon Sir J Bowring. Now, who are the parties that are «uned »t b this resolution? The right hon. gentleman the membe for BucKnghamshire stated on Friday evening that it wa a vote conveying censure on the Government: »nd th Government are willing to accept their share of the censure and to acknowledge the responsibility which attaches to them; becaure, when these proceedings were made know to them, looking at the whole ofthe cirenmstances existin at Canton, »t the coarse of conduct pursued by the Chines towards the British, at the difficulties ia which the British authorities were placed, and at the entire concurrence o opinion between the British plenipotentiaryand the admira the Government felt that it was their duty, without crticizin *-·-f nuu* «i»0 ^?????? value ireiuiQ í.uuã,uieabViuèij ???? ?? not given an nnqnalified approval-the Government fel that it was their duty, I say, to give an open and cordia support to British officers placed under circamstaaces o freat difficulty, because they thonght that those officer ad been actuated by a true sense of what British interest required, and that a disavowal of their conduct wonld b fatal to British iaterests in China. (Cheers.) What wa the Uboured object ofthe right hon. gentleman the membe for Carlisle throughout his entire speech but to show tha *U the responsibUity rested undividedly upon Sir J. Bow ring 7 That attempt to separate Sir J. Bowring from Sir M Seymour has run through the whole debate, but it was no dispUyed by any other hoa. member to the exteat tha it was by the right hon. member for Carlisle. The righ hon. gentleman sayg :- "I have long knewn Sir M. Seymour, »nd I fully corro borate all that has been said by the gaUant admiral. I be lieve Sir M. Seymour to be one of the most brave, humane and discreet offioers in Her Majesty's service, and I »m bonad to say I do not think th»t a better selection for th Chinese command «onld possibly have been made." That right hon. gentleman having filled the office of Firs Lord ofthe Admiralty, and having often had the appoin ment of admirals in his hands, hig testimony upon tha point is highly gratifying. (Hear, hear.) He goes onto say :- " I would «dd »lso in confirmation of what my right hon «ndgalUnt friend (Admiral Berkeley) his said, ttat I d not think in the discharge of tho duties of Ins command »n mancould be more certainly influenced by motives of hu maaity. and Christian principle than Sir M. Seymour. have said thus mach of an esteemed aad galUnt friend, »n «11 my presumption would be in favour of the coarse which in difficult circumstances that gallant officer thought fit t adopt. My right hon. and gallant friend has observed that when the ambassador fails tte admirális called upon to act In this case the ambassador, invested with the f nil authority of the Crown, has, ia mjr view, called npon the »dmiral exercising his own discretion, and leaving none to tha officer." And he then proceeds to argue ttat in this instance th whole of the responsibility was exercised exclusively by th civu officers at Canton. Now, I am prepared to show tha not one of all these transactions which it is proposed to cen suro was taken without communication with Sir M Seymour in the first instance, and his full and entir concurrence. The first letter from Sir J. Bowring to Mr. Parkes shows the course which he thought it righ to take. Sir John Bowring ??? been represented as exer cising an »nthority for which ho was quite unfitted, and ? acting ia » rash, hasty, »ad intemperate m»nner. Let u see how far that charge is borne out by his conduct. He receives an »ccount from Mr. Parkes of the outrage on tt lorcha Arrow. What does he sty to it ? In his first letter dated October 10,1856k he s»ys:- viewer " I have had a conference with his Excellency tte Nava Commander-in-Chief on the subject of your despatch dated the 8th of October, reporting the improper proceedings o Chinese officers in carrying »way the crew and lowering th flag of »British vessel called tte Arrow, and whichlfind fa registered hatha name of a Chinese settler in this eoloay Sir Michael Seymour will instruct Commodore Elliot to discuss with yon the most appropriate meansof obtaining redress for the wrong which has been done." The first step taken by Sir J. Bowring, then, was to call in the counsel and »dvice of Sir M. Seymour beforo addressing any instructions to Mr. Parkes. What did Sir M. Seymonr himself do l Writing to Commodore Elliot-who is »lso one of the naval ofiicers repreeented as being under the orders of Sir J. Bowring or Mr. Parkes-he says :- " I have to desire yoa will lose no time in conferring with Mr. Parkes, »iter he has received Sir John Bowring's de spatch, and act according tothe determination both you and the consul may ultimately come to." Is not »TI this in exact opposition to the representation o îr S8^ hon* Bentlenwn ? (Hear, hear.) \Vh»t next i Mr. Parkes's condnct when he receives »n »nswerfrom Yeh And here I mast again «Ilude to something which fell from my noble friend the member ira London with regard to the tenour of that »nswer. Mr- P*rkcs received Yeh' »nswer, aad that answer is one which my noble rrisnd sav was s»tisf*ctory. The statement w«s repeated by »n hon and learned gentleman to-night ; bat my noble fnend mus have qnoted from memory, because his Quotation was in correct. What did Mr Parkes do ? Did he, «s represented immediately say that the answer was insufficient, aad »tonca call ajion the n*val officers to pat the forces of the Queen in motion, m order to revenge the insult which h»d been committed, »nd to exact reparation ? No ; but he writes to oír ? · üowting :- _ " On receipt of this reply from the Imperial Commis sioner ? at once wnranoicated it to Commodore Elliot, who te^S «qaally dissatisfied with its farms, determined to riv effect without deUy to his instructions, by enforcing?? redress wbchhasthus been twice refosed> "scingin He commardcated, then, with Commodore Effiot-who>e ??^?^?**?1 ??01^ "» «?«3*! to more weigh than Sir J-Bownmr-gorMr. Parkes's.

(He»r he«i iZLZvZZ to a most ex^rdinar^SonÄ bliho ^ghThon gentleman. The nght hon. gentleman said : - "lîow.it iàveryremarkable that, forthe firsttime.Iboliev« 2?,,???$ »otonly were tne »»v^^toíÄ gested, but the future course and extent of those on*»tiftrf were laid down by tte «perintend.ntof tr^ÄÄS? took tteOTiam.nd of the fleet «s regarded what operation were to be performed, but who Uid down in most extlao" d^*S ¿e*11 the precise mode in which those operationV jhonld be conducted.

(Hear, he*r.) I shoul have thought that the experience of the right hon. gentle man wonldhavetanght him tho extreme improbibility-nay the impoMibüity, of such a course being adopted. (Hear hear.) The right hon. gentleman then weat on to describ what he_was pleased to call the instructions of Mr. Purke to Admrral Seymonr, and he condescended, as the Scotc s*y, to partieaUrs, »nd m one passage of his speech, he im patedtoMr. ?arkcs aa offence which could not have bec perpetrated with a Bntish »dmiral as agent. He stated tha Mr^Parkes? instructed Admiral Seymour to shell the hous ? ?! 7:mch '»»3 known to bo surrounded by densely popuUted houses. So that the insinuation ofthe righthon gentleman is that Mr. Parkes imposed upon » Britis »dmiral the obligation of performing «a act derogatory to his «hatteteras aa officer. (Loud cries of "Hear, hear» Imart s»y th»t the nght hon. geatleman, who has rea these papers »nd who has listened to the discussion in th House, has m this case been ignorant of, or by soma mo extraordinary accident has overlooked in the imaginary <*s t??} he,Pfesentedto the House, one important fact reU ting to what he eallsthese instructions of Mr. Parkes.· la despatch, dated October 23, Sir J. Bowring writes :- " No satisfactionhaving been obtained from the Imperia Commissioner, Mr. Consul Parkes, wisely Judging that conference with the naval commander-in-chief and nme would be very useful, came down to Hongkong on 'th morning of the 20th inst., »nd, »fter a long and mterostin discussion, it was decided that Mr. Parkes should give i vmtmg a succinct »ccount of wh»t had occurred, and th such suggestions as obtained the general concurrence of S Michael Seymour (hear, hear) and myself should bo em bodied in » despatch, to be wknowledged by me, »nd whic ehould serve »s a general-outline of proceedings intended to be taken.

(Hear, hear ) On this subject Sir John Bowring again consults Admiral Sey "L0?! and "lvites the expression of his opinion. Ia proo of this let me turn to » letter written by Sir Micbcf Sey mour to the Admiralty, conveying his views on the qaestion :- . "1^?^?? tbe morning of the 27th I caased another lette tobewntteato the High Commissioner to the effect that as satisfaction had not been offered for tho »ff»ir of th Arrow, I should resume offensive operations ; »nd his Excel lency having, by his iuegal measures and determination to refuse reparation, Jiroduced thisdispUy of force, I concurred in opinion with Sir John Bowring th»t this was » fitting opportunity for requiring the fulfilment of long-evaded treaty obligations, »nd I therefore, in addition to tho pngiaal demands, instructed Mr. Parkes tom»kette fol lowmgeonimanieatioa^'Thatjto prevent the recurrence of evus Hke the present, which h»vo beea occasioned by th aisregard paid bythe Imperial Commissioaer to the repeated applications for Tedress and satisfaction made to him by letter in the matter «f ihe Arrow by Her Majesty's pleni potentiary »nd the consul-writing, in consequence of th closing of the city to foreigners, being the only meanso Mmmunication-I demanded for all foreign representativo ^lf«^ »f««s to the authorities and city cf Canton (where all tte Chinese high officiids reside) »sis enjoyed Ctatorialon'e?'' ?>?' f0UX P°*t!?' *°d îed *° «* * Snch was the dtmand made by Admiral Seymnar, »fter hi opmion h»d been asked by Sir J. BowriBf, limiting tha demand, as Her Majesty's plenipotentiary suggested i should be limited, to this official reception, the admira »tatiaç th»t he quite oonenrred with Sir J. Bowring in thinking this should be granted. It is necessary to show by these passages that not the generalright of »cotes, ba only the officUl reception was insisted upon, because thi makes a material difference in the view which ought to b taken of this question. The one was a demand about which there might, perhaps reasonably bea difference of opinion theother wasxxightoftheatmortimportanc·, without which there would be no security »gainst a recurrence of those disputes. (Hear.) Another article of indictment »gains Sir J. Bowring is that be stimaUted the attack m»de on Commi*noier Yeh's house. Now, Iooncur in «very word which has been said in commendation of Admiral Seymour and I do aot think there is one act «anctioned by that gal Unt officer which »hows th»t be is deficient in those high qualities and especially in those feelings of hu manity which have been ascribed to him.

(Hear, hoar.) bespeaking the indulgence of the House, addressing it «s now was for the first time, he felt the ordinary difficult of such » positioa enhanced by the f*ct that ho was caU npon to express an opinion and to record a vote in oppositi to tho conclusions come to by the leaders of tho great Co »ervative party, of which he was one of tho humble su porters. (Hear, hear.) Ho felt bound, however, to sta frankly to tho House the decision he had formedon th question. Tho Ust act ofthe Chinoso which'brought matte to a crisis (for ho denied that it was the only thing we h gone to war »bout) was the »flair of tho Arrow. Now, t Honso ought to know that the lorcha was » vessel pure and entirely of a foreign buUd. Though buUt, perhaps, Chinese workmen, there was a total difference between and the ordinary Chinese models, and therefore there cou have been no mistake on the part of tho Chinese as the character of the vessel- (Hear, hear.) Previous tho treaty lorchas wero'aot admitted within tho river Canton ; their presence thero was conseqnently a proof th they wore recognized and admitted under the tre»ty foreign vessels, «ad they had paid duty accordingly. H there been no flag flying, therefore, on board the Arro andif the name had not been a sufficient indication of nation»Uty,it could not h»vo been mistaken for a Chine vessel. (Hear, hear.) Then tho question arose, wh was tte animus of the Chmese Government in acting they did? His experience ? him to beUevo that t Chinese authorities acted designedly, and he was bome o in this view by looking at the facts of the case. It was sa that one man on board w»s accused of being the father o ph-»te, »nd what did the Chinese offioers do thereupo They went oa board »nd seized not only the man accused being the fatterof »pirate, bnt »11 tho crew, with two exce tions.

Again, Lord Napier, dnrin his time, wrote that the Chincso Government were alway prone to dreniate prcjudicul report« about himself »u other foreigners in Chin». Tbe truth was th*t th Chinese Government wero in the h»b!t annually of issuin edicts with the view of destroying in the minds of thei people anything lifctf rcepect for foreigners by «cousin them of tte foulest crimes that could possibly bo imagined »nd the House how saw the consequences. Ho might quot Sir John Davis, Sir George Bonham, »nd Captain EUio to the same effect; but ho would bo content with «ferrin to a passtge in the letter of Sir H.

(Hear, hear.)

(Hoar, hear. Jpehad received a letter from Hongkong that morning tíated Jan. 1,0; m which his correspondent informed him that »n »ttempt had been made to poison the Earopeau community by mixing arsenic with the bread, but the dose was too strong, and was found out after a few mouthfuls. Theletter went on to ? ay, "Be assured that some demon stration on the part of the Chinese will take pUce before the new year, but where the blow is to fall no one can tell." Ihe hon. member for the West Riding had stated, and other con. members had »dopted his opinion, that British mer chants in China were advocates of war, with » view to then own gain; but surely aU who knew anything of the iaterests oí commerce must be aware that war was always most in janons to them. (Hear.) The hon. and learned member for Devonport (Sir E. Perry) had stated that the baUnce o trade was alwavs in favour of tho Chinese; bnt that state ÎMnt was not correct, for in 1796,1810,1813, 1829, »nd ia _ lco», there were heavy balances duo from the Chinese ; and from a let-er he had received that morning he found that the British merchants at Canton had addressed Sir J. Bowring on the 5th of Janu ary, înquiringwhat steps wonld be taken to insure the safety of goods left in Canton, «nd what means would be taken to procure compensatioa to the agents ia China and their corre fpondenteathome for the goods which were now jeopar dized. The address also asked ttat measures might be adopted to insure the payment by the Chinese of the heavy deb. now due to the British merchaats. That circumstance, he thonght, would prove that tte balance was not alwavs against the English merchants. With respect to the allegation wbioh had been made of the overbearing manners of Jmglisbmen in Chino, he would refer hon. members to vanous edicts which had been issued restricting Europeana from taking almost the only exercise practicable in Canton -lie meant rowing on the river. The boats used were light whernes, mostly built in London, and were not at aU calcuUted to do »ny damage to the heavy Chinese barges. However, an edict was published forbidding Europeans . iv "55.'?fly' and eaU°P on the river, to the destruction of the Chinese boats !" Having been in China himseU, »nd acquainted with the state of things there, he felt he was only dome his dntv to his absent friends in making them known. (Hear.) The hon. member for the West Riding had stated that the British merchants in China were wanting in education, in abUity, and in intelligence. (" No.") The hon. number had threatened them that the China trade would, hke the Mediterranean trade, pass into the hands of Swiss, Greeks, and Germans, and that could only be from the greater inteUigence of those merchants. But did the hon. member recoUect that Manchester, Bradford, and other places in Lancashire were swarming with foreigners, and did he mean therefore to infer »ny want of inteUlgence or ability on the part of the Manchester merchants ! (Hear. With regard to the question of entrance into the city of Canton, speaking as an individual, that was not » right he cared about, but the exolusiou was a degrading restriction impesed by the Chinese authoritiesto lower Europeans in the eyes of the Chinese people. (Hear.) At the same time he would not have gone to war about such a point. (Hear. He, however, did not say thatseclnsion was not a part of his complaint against the Chinese, but at present the only demond was official communication withthe authorities in the city, and the unhappy case of the six young men which he had mentioned was a proof ofthe necessity for such communication. If we receded from any demand the consoquenc s would be felt in all the other ports of China, and not only there, but throughout India. He had reeeiTed a letter from Singapore, dated the 23d of January, in which the writer mentionéi numerous placards of an alarming character spread throughout the town and country. One notice offered #2,000 for the head of Governor Blundell, and, added the wnter, "the report is that on the 29th aU shops are to be closed, and there is to be a regular set to. I do not like the pressnt state of affairs, particuUrly as matters in China art· so bad (hear), for it is natural to expect that the Chinese here wül side with their countrymen. It is not at aU pleasant to go to bed with revolvers under one's pfflow, but we must be prepared for the worst." (Hear, hear.) Surely hon members did not wish to encourage sucha state of things. (Hear.) He hoped the House would not agree to any vote of censure. He did not stand up to defend Sir J. Bowring (hear) ; he did not say whether he was a fit manto have beeu sent out, but that was at present beside the question. What should be considered was the practical effect of a vote of that House, and he er.treated them not to be led away by anything like party feeling, bat to decide apon the real ments of the question. (Hear.) It would, be no light matter to endanger our position ia China-he did not speak of the revenue derived from the trade with that coantry forthe question ought not tobe decided upon fiscal grounds, but upon grounds of humanity (hear, hear) ; if we drew back upon the present occasioa it would be imperilling our whole position ia that country. (Hear, hear.) He should therefore give his support to the Government, and vote againet the resolutions. Sir J. PAKINGTON.-I am sorry to say there was nothing in the speech of the right hon. baronet the Secre of State for the Homo Department which has changed in the sUghtest degree the view which I entertained upon this tabject. Oa the contrary, I think the House wiU be o opinion with me that the speech ofthe right hon. gentle man, like that of his colleague, the Secretary for the Colo nies, was skUfuUy »dapted to evade aU the prinoipal points we have to coasider. I think the House wffl »lso feel that a great portion of the speech ofthe right hon. baronet w»î directed to matters whioh have nothing whatever to do with the fcsue we are caUed upon to decide. When the right hon gentleman compUined of the tone of speeches whioh have been made as unfair to pubUc officers abroad and evincing a desire to run dowa and depreciate those officers, I think the pubUo and this House wffl feel that during the progress of this debate no censure has been passed upon any officUl in China which has not been forced upon us bythe strictest considerations of justice, and before I dt down, I think I shaU be able to show the House that the right hon. gentleman has been altogether unsuccessful in his attempt to défend Sir J. Bowring from the attacks which have been made upon him. I confess I never have risen to address this House with greater reluctance than upon the present occasion. The subject is a most painful one, and I trust I shaU not be suspected of such presumption as to suppose that I can add anything to tho unusual amount of abiUty and eloquence which has distinguished this debate ; but from the first moment that I read the despatches my mind has been so fiUed with feelings of shame (hear, hear)-I am sorry to say with feelings of shame-at the extent to which the character of the country has been compromised by the proceedings whioh have taken place at Canton that I cannot consent to give a süent vote on this question, or refrain from recording the strong opinions which I entertain with respect to it. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman the Secretary of State for the Colonies deprecated party speaking on this subject, and the hon. and learned gentle man the Attorney-General compUined on Friday aight that the speeches of gentlemen who are opposed to the Goverameat had been dictated and influenced by party feeling. My hon. friend who has just addressed the House has again adverted to thesame point, but I think the impui tation most unjust. (Hear, hear.) There have been speeches, I acknowledge, in the course of this debate, touohing on party questions, which I, for one, heard with great regret. The hon. and learned member for Devonport stated that, in obedience to his convictions, he should support the motion of n,y hon. friend the member for the West Riding, but if the motion had proceeded from this side of the House he should have given a different vote. An hon. friend of mine, the member for West Norfolk, has made a very opposite declaration. He says he concurs in the views expressed by the hon. member for the West Riding. He sees the force of this motion, but ho shaU be governed by coasiderations altogether extraneous to the subject of debate before os) and, under the influence of totaUy different feelings, he shaU-vcteagair^the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding. -^ Mr. BENTINCK.-I beg pardon. What I said was, I . ehould bo guided by other considerations than the words of the motion. I never said I should be guided by other considerations upon the question beforo the House. (Hear, hear.) Sir J. PAKINGTON.-My hon. friend cannot deny that he stated he felt the force snd justice of the motion, »nd he has now repeated that he shall be guided in his vote by otter cocsiäeratíons. I mean so disrespect to'either the
Jioii.andJ«røed_AembrÆrjr*Tonr^ the member for,-WestNorfolk, when-1 say that.I hear such declarations with the deepest regret, and that'I think ròch declarations ctoonly tend tolower the character of thisHouse. (Cheers.) But when the-hon. and learned Attorney-General or the Secretary of State for the Coloniei jS»ys that those who are · opposing the Government are infla. enced and guided by party considerations, Ithinkamore unjust or more unfounded charge was never made. (Hear.) It docs so happen that I can afford proof that my opinion! were formed irrespective of »ny party consideartions. When lhadIread the despatches, on their first arrival from Canton, I met two friends who are now hearing me, and to them í aid that I thought the case so atrocious, so entirely unjustifiable, that of course we should have no discussion in rarliameutoa the subject; for of course the Government wonld immediately repudUte the acts of the officials and recaU them. And I do deeply regret that Her Jjajestys Ministers have not taken that coursethat they have not repudiated the acta of Sir -. Bownng »nd other offioUls, »nd that they have not recalled them from the scene of their misconduct. (Hear, hear.) I can assure the Government that no triumph of argument iu this debate (and I can conceive no greater tnnmph of argument than has been already gained)-that no taumph ia the division, should such there be, can »fford to me »ny compensation forthe unfortunate »nd dishonourable fact that the Government of EngUnd hai been compromised for a period, however short, by having given its assent and support to the conduct of its officiak in Canton. (Cheers.) I have heard no reason ia the speeches of Her Majesty's Ministers for the approbation given to that conduct, except the necessity-strongly dwelt upon by several members of tho Government, and especiaUy by the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Colonies-of upholding the distant servants of the Crown. The right hon. gentleman said that if the Goverameat were to recaU officials who were »otuated by good iatentioas, they would no longer deserve to be served by upright, honest, and independent men. I am the last man who would deny that the servants ofthe Crown ia distant dependencies deserve the support of the Government to the utmost possible extent that support can be fairly given. But, on the other hand, I can imagine no doctrine more dangerous or more destructive of the interests of the country thaa the broad principle that, whatever the conduot of distant officials may be, whether they deserve credit for protecting or blame for compromising the interests of England, at aU events and at »? risks they »re to be supported by the Government »t home. (Cheers.) The Secretary of State rather exults in tte fact that the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle and the noble lord the member for London were members of the Government which sent out Sir J. Bowring. But, whatever Government sent out Sir J. Bowring, let us draw this inference-that there is great danger in the çractice, too much resorted to by aU Governmentswhen malang these appointments, to consider the number of votes the person recommended has given in the same lobby, rather than his competence or real fitness for the post he is sent to fiU. (Hear, hear.) I care not what Governmentmade the appointment, bat I think we »re now suffering from that consideration having been too much attended to in the appointment of Sir J. Bowring (Cheers.) Like the Secretary of State for the Home d£ partment, I shaU not presume at this period to enter Into the question as to the legaUty of the claim of tte lorcha to be considered a British vessel. There is a question of f actwhether the flag was flying in the lorch»?-???? whioh I think the evidence is as strong one way as the other. Then comes the question whether she had the right to carry the flag ? If she had no right to carry the flag the fact of the ffiig flying makes the matter worse, but whether she had the nght is a legal question upon which I shaU not presume to give an opmion. So ako is the question whether she had a legal license. But the question whether the Ucense had or had not expired fe moro one of fact than of law, and I »m not wiUing to accept the answer that the being at sea is sufficient excuse for not renewing the license within the year. Was tte Arrow at sea ? (Hear, hear.) With any reason or common sense can the Ar-ow be said to have beea »t sea? She was lying at Canton. Hongkong is at the mouth of the river. I presume she had passed Hongkong to get up to Canton, and Sir J. Bowrine writes on the 13th of October, "I find, on inquiry »t the harbourmasters, that the register had not been regularly presented at his office, according to the regulations" (Hear.) I presume that refers to the regulation that the Ucense is to be presented every six months, «nd here is another proof that the Arrow had not compUed with the terms of the Ucense. There is a point connected with these questions of law to whioh the hon. »nd learned member for aavistock has adverted in the able speech which 1 heard with great pleasure this evening. I wiU appeal to this Houso what wiUbetheeffectiaothercountries, what will betheeffectin Europe, when it is found that the British Government is sanctioning these atrocities and this bloodshed on doahtful grounds·; (Cheers.) I am wiUing to admit that on Friday night we heard a speech displaying great power of argument and great learning and abffity from Her Majesty's AttorneyGeneral. Everybody in this House is ready to acknowledge the distinguished powers of that hon.andlearnedgentleman and perhaps he never gave a more striking proof of them than when, for a long period, he rivetted the attention of a popalar assembly to a dry legal argument. I speak with all frankness of the hon. and learned gentleman ; andif he were ? his pUce, I am sure he would feel with me that he has not yet arrived at that period when his opinion however able it may be, can compete in weight with that of the fflustnous Lyndhurst. (Cheers.) unfettered by party connexions ("Oh !"), uninfluenced by party hopes, that great and distinguished man has laid down the Uw affecting this case m terms which wffl have weight in every country in Europe. (Hear, hear.) I am willing to admit that the legal authonties »rebalanced. We have Lord Lyndhurst andLord St. Leonard's on one side, «ndtheLord ChanceUor and Lord Wensleydale on the other, and fa this House we have the hon. and learned member for Tavistock differing from Her Majesty's Attorney-General. Is it not a lamentable state of things to exhibit to the world tt»t_ these proceedings in China, when discussed in the Bnfash Parliament, lead, nottoanunanimous opinion on the legahty of the measures adopted, bat to a differeace of judgment on the part of the most eminent legal authorities ? (Hear, hear. ) Another portion of this subject has, I think, beea very Uttle adverted to, if at aU ; and to it I am desirous of calling the attention of the House-I «Unde to the opinion which was conveyed to China in reference 'to this very matter in the name of the Crown by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The House wffl recoUect that this doubtful ordinance was passed in March, 18Õ5, »nd that when it arrived in this country the noble lord the member for London, then Secretary of" State for the Colonies, would not give the consent of the Crown to it, but referred it to the Board of Trade. That Board thought its legality extremely doubtful, and it was sent back to China on the 22d of June unconfirm ed. The ordinance thus sent back must have been received there before the end of September, »nd therefore the Ucense granted to the Arrow must have beea granted at the time when the ordinance was received back without having obtained the consent of the Crown. (Hear hear.) But what foUows? The next step was this' ttat information having been requested by the Secretary of State, reasons were returned from China explaining why it was thought expedient that the ordinance should be confirmed ; but it was suggested from this country that another ordinance should bo passed, »nd I beg the attention of the House to this most important lanettase proceeding from the Board of Trade. Mr. Booth, one of the secretaires, wrote in the name of the Board to suggest whether, as some doubts might be entertained as to the license to use the British flag in vessels registered in the name of Chinese residents as provided bv the ordinance, it might not be desirable to pass a further ordinance. Here you have doubts thrown on the legaUtv of the very ordinance under which »lone it could be contended that theArrow was entitled to use the British fla» (Hear, hear.) Well, while the legaUty of the ordinanco appears to be doubtful, I wffl-though my own conviotion is ttat it was not legal-assume, like the hon. and learned member for Tavistock, for argument's sake, the entire correctness of the license, and concede that the Arrow was a Bntish vessel,-then, I «sk, did the transactions which took place justify such an excess of punishment as was inflicted ? (Cheers.) What will be the opinion of Europe-on conduct suchas this? Whatever might have beea the rights of the vessel, the revenge taken by the Bntish authorities was excessive andanmeasured. (Cheers 1 I wffl not detain the House by commenting at any length on those discreditable contradictions of Sir J. Bowring with respect to the charaoter of the vessel which have already been adverted to by the noble lord the member for London ia a high-minded speech which was admired aadappreciated by aU parties in this House. (Hear.) But, much as Iadmired that speech, I confess that thenoblelord did not appear to mo to dweU with aU the severity he ought on this point. He was foUowed, however, by the righthon. member for Carlisle, who placed in clear juxtaposition the two contrary statements of Sir J. Bownng. The Secretary of State for tto Home Department has this evening told the House that we have borne hardly on Sir J. Bowring, »nd treated him with harshness and unfairness ; but I entreat the House to reflect that the right hon. gentleman never touched on this point. (Hear, hear. ) Sir J. Bowring was charged with falsehood, or the most barefaced contradictions, »nd if his charaoter is to stand weU before theworld, it is »bsolutelynecessary that the matter should be explained. (Hear.) The,rlght hon gentleman the Home Secretary, while complaining that Sir 3. Bowring had been treated badly, never even adverted to that accusation. (Hear.) I «m sorry to say that the accusations against Sir J. Bowring arej not limited to this instance. Lam now ahoat to advert to a circumstaace which made me listen with some surprise to the speech of the hon member for Lancaster, the chairman of the East IndU and China Association, who vindicated in this matter the conduct of Government, and «lso, as I understood, of Sir J. Bownng. A question arose some two or three years a»o »bout the coUection of the duties »t Shanghai, after the riot which had occurred there. Sir J. Bowring had occasion to interfere with respect to the collection of these duties a e was in correspondence with the Foreign-office in this country, and was charged by the Chamber of Commerce at &hanghai,and the charge was transmitted to this country, with having deUberately misrepresented the instructions hé received from the Foreign-office, »nd thereby obtaining tte coment of the merchants at Shanghai to an arrangement to which otherwise they would not h»ve given their consent. I hold ? my hand » report of »n interview whi-h in 1854 the East India and China Association had with Lord Clarendon and I find in it this statement :- ' " Mr. Gregson read to his lordohip a resolution this day passed, to the effect that Sir John Bowring's proceedings had lost him tte confidence of the merchants engaged ? the Chin» trade; and praying that in tto .approaching revision of the treaty Her Majesty's Government be represented by someierson Of known experience and discretion." (Hear, hear.) Here we have a proof of the estimation in which Sir J. Bowring wa's held by the mercantile body connected with Chin» ; and it »ffords ground for! concluding that the Government would have acted with more discretion if they had not ' ept our interests at Clhinasolongin the hands of Sir J. Bowring. (Hear, hear.) Wehaveheard a great desi of praise this evening from the right hon.igentlíraanth&Home-Seoretarj with respect to Mr.¡Parkes,;the consul; and the right hon., gentleman found fault withthe hon, member for the West Riding for having arraigned the
" ?¿?Sedí?t-#f-Ç«pírlc-Ss?-^-^Í!eaJ«BateJheJe^.of ??. Parkes " fUptious» as the hon. member fõFthelíest TlidiBg called oneaf Sir J. Bowring*« aocumenìs, 'butnevertheless I do find in the letters Of Kr. Paries eóntradictións to an extent most dangerous, and unwise on the -part ota person intrusted! with auch deUe»t«negoti»tîons with the authonties of the Chinese Government. On October li, Commissioner Yeh wrote to Mr. Parkes in these words:" Hereafter Chmese officers wül en no account, without re-.son, seize and take into custody tte people belonging to foreign lorchas, but when Chmese subjects build for themselves vessels foreigners »houd not seU registers to them, for if ?? be done it wiU occasion confusion between n»tive aad foreign ships, »nd render it difficult to distinguish b£tweenthem." · I think every sensibleman will sympathize with these sentiments, and here is a promise from Commissioner Teh that here»fter Chinese officers wffl on no »ccount, without reason, seize or tako into custody the people belonging to foreign lorchas. Well, what did Mr. Parkes do? ???? week from that time he wrote (on October 21) to Commissioner Yeh as foUows :- "But your ExceUency, with »strange disregard both of justice and treaty engagements, has offered no reparation Or apology for this injury, 'and by retaining the men you ???? seized in your custody signify your Approval of this vioUtioa of the treaty, »nd le*ve Her Majesty's Government without »ay assurance that similar agressions shaU not occur again.' " Suoh was the language of Mr. Parkes, thongh only a week before he had received a most distinct assurance that the very thmg should not occur again. (Hear, hear.) The only construction which Commissioner Yeh could put upon such Unguage was that the English »uthorities Were determined, justly or unjustly, to quarrel with him. (Cheers.) That was the only »ssurance that Commissioaer Yeh could give. On the very next day after Consul PaTkes wrote to Commissioner Yeh he received aa »ssur»nce from him that whea Uwless characters were suspected by the Chiaese aathonties to be oa board foreign lorchas the first step taken by the Chinese commissioner would bo to inform the consnl, in order that he might act in conjunction withthe Chinese authorities in tte management of such affairs. The reply of Consnl Parkes was that that might be considered » sufficient assurance if the word "Brittan," instead of "foreign,'' had preceded the word " lorchas." That reply contamedan »amission that »U the 12 men had been rele»sed. Andit was at the moment when Sir J. Bowring had declared that the vessel was not entitled to tte protection of a British vessel-when Commissioner Yeh harf given an assurance that what was complained of should not again occur-when he had declared his eatire ignorano» of her being a British vessel, »nd that the British flag was aot flying-whea the men whose capture had been compUined of had been returnedwhen the whole issue was changed-when the case of the lorcha had become too weak to be maintained any longer (hear, hear,) that the old claim to enter the cite-was revived, »nd that the city was bombarded. He (Sir ¿.Pakington) c¡.nld not pass by this part of the case without aUuding to what had been s»id th»t eveningby the Secretary of State for the Home Departmeat with refereace to Admiral Seymour. Ho admitted in common with that right hon. gentleman, »nd »lso with the right bon. baronet the member for Carlisle «nd the galUat Lord of the Admiralty (Admiral Berkeley) the high character of that distinguished officer. He did not doubt that Admiral Seymour had acted in this matter most reluctanay, and with » sincere conviction that it was his duty to carry into effect the orders issued by Sir J. Bowring. But he (Sir J.Pakington) could not consent on a matter of this kind to compliment away the truth. (Hear, hear.i He thought that a man of the high character of Admiral Seymour might have discovered that he had to deal with a chief who wasnot competent to manage matters of such importance and delicacy, and that he would hava acted in a manner more becoming his position as an English officer if he had exercised a restraining h»nd, *ndh»d not shown himself to be such » wiUing »gent of Sir J. Bowring. He (Sir J. Pakmgton) would refer the House to two remarkable passages in the correspondence of Commissioner Yeh which had not been adverted to during the debate, but which dealt with the whole merits of the case, and ought, therefore, not lightly to be passed over. Commissioner Yeh, writing on the oth of November to Admiral Seymour, »fter the unhappy bombardment of Canton, ased these words; which ought to raise a blush oa the cheek of any Englishman who read them :- "I must add that, as it is the habit of your ?????????? natica to adore the Spirit of Heaven, it behoved you, in my opmion, so much the more to conform in your actions to the principle given as by Heaven." It was scarcely possible to imagine »severer sarcasm than was contained in these words of a man who was called » Chmese barbarian to the Christian officer of » Christian nation. Again, on the llth of the same month, Commissioner Yeh wrote thus to Admiral Seymour :- " Your ExceUency fired at once into tte city, »nd «sk yourself whether this consists with tte forms of war as waged by a great State, or whether thI3 is the practice of civilization." (Hear, hear.) He (Sir J. Pakington) deeply regretted to find that throughout the whole of this correspondeaco there was manifested the same painful and discreditable difference between the conduct of the British and the Chmese authorities. On tte one side were pride, arrogance, «nd insult, while on the other were calmness, reasoning__ (" Hear, hear," and a Uugh)-he was astonished to see one hon. member who had been a very short time ia that House, and who was not very much accustomed to its debates, make merry with the remarks which he had made. He could only presume that that hon. member had not read the papers (hear, hear), for if he had he would find that what he ?? vJSt inSton) had said was perfectly correct. (Hear, hear. ) The language of Commissioaer Yeh was distinguisbed by calmness, by reasoning, but above aU bv moderation under the grossest insults. (Hear, hear.) Which of the letters wntten by the Chinese and British »uthorities were those of a gentleman-above aU, which those of a Christian -those of the barbarian, the non-Christian, or those of him who wrote as the officUl of a Christian conntry? Ho (S^ï,J· .Pakington) deeply regretted the language which had been used during these debates as to the conduct which we as a civilized Power ought to adopt towards Oriental States. The right hon gentleman the Vice-President of the Board of Trade had said that whea dealing with such States our object should be to terrify them with ideas of our power, »nd a simUar doctrine was laid down by a noble earl (the Earl of CUrendon) in »nother place. That noble earl had said ttat it was important to make the Chinese sensible of the Uw of force (hear), but ho (Sir J. Pakington) would rather »dopt the sentiment thus expressed bythe noble member f or the city of London,-"I caro not whether we are dealing with the Chmese or with Europeans, depend upoa the sound maxim 'Be just and fear not."' (Hear, hear.) He could imaginé nothing more unworthy of Englishmen than the ideathat we were to bully the weak when we durst not do so to the strong (bear, hear), and that we were to attack the uafortonate Chinese and destroy a peaceful town merely because they did not choose to act according to our wishes. He thought it was mest unfortunate that gentlemen holding high official positions in this country eatertained opinions with regard to our conduct as a nation which he beUeved to be mostunsound. Everymember ofthe Govemmentwho had taken part in the debate betrayed the weakness of the cause which he attempted to defend. He (Sir J. Pakmeton) wished to know whether Her Majesty's Government fîfiT^6 ,0?T1011 expressed on this subject by aaoble earl (the Earl of Clarendon) in »nother place, to the effect that the circumstances of this outbreak in China were precisely analegoas to those which took place in the year 1846 Inttatyearavioleat outbreak was committed by British S*·"6?*,.« ot lon8 afterwards a murder was committed. ??????? was sacrificed, »nd theUw of force was resorted to in order to compel Chin» to give redress. It was therelore untrue to assert that the circumstances attending the outbreak in 1846 »nd those which preceded the recent bombardment of Cantea were analogous. The circumstances °£tbe tweases differed from e»ch other as widely as possible. Ihe right hon. bart. the member for Carlisle (Sir J Graham) said that three Secretaries of State h«d given directions forbidding our plenipotentUriesto risk engaging this country in war for the sake of the right of entrant» into Canton. My right hon. friend (continued Sir J. Fakingten) understated the case. He forgot that in 1854 Lord CUrendon himself repeated these instructions as decidedly as any of his predecessors. They were distinctly given-and never better or more powerfully-by the noble lord the present First Minister ia 1848, and were repeated ?by Lord Granvffle, LordMalmesbury, andLord CUrendon. I_ am passing by Lord Grey's peremptory order that no violence should be attempted upon this subject. Lord Clarendon writing February, 1854, says :- "_ There are, unquestionably, pointe which it would be desirable to secure, and to which we have even » right by treaty: »nd »mong those I would mention bee »nd aarcsfaieted intercourse with the Chiaese aathorities, aad free jomissjon mto some of the cities of China, especiaUy Canton. The treatment of these questions requires, however much caution ; for if we should press them in menacing language, and yet fæl m carrying them, our natioaal hoaour would require us to have recourse to force, and in order to obtain results the practical advantage of which is not clearly demonstrated we might place in peril Oie vast commercial interests which have already grown up in Chin», and which, with good »nd temperate management, wffl daily acquire greater extension." The Unguage of the noble lord opposite (Lord Palmerston), when Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was so explicit and, in my opinion, so prudent, and so directly in Opposition to the condact which the noble lord is now sanctioning and supporting with the approbation of Her Majesty's Government, that I trust the House wffl. »Uow me to read an extract from? his despatch. The noble viscoaat, writing in December, 1848, said :- ° " I am clearly of opmion that it wouldaot be advisable to proceed to hostile measures against Canton, or to take the ?nnusua]I stepof amission to Pekm, in regard to »privilege which, like the admission of British sabjects into the city of Cantea, we haye indeed a right to demand, but whichwe could scarcely enjoy with security or advantage if we were to lucceed m enforcing it by arms."

Mr. COLLIER «aid that an »ttempt had been m»de to knock down «U the Uwyers in that House with the opmion of » noble lord deUvered in another pUce. He ventured to think, however, that both the lee»l and non-legal members of that House would feel th»t tins was a question which onght to be decided, aot bv authonty,but by argument. (Hear, hear.) Hewould at onceh»vaproceeded tothe subject of this resolution had not thei hoa.member who moved It, aad many of thoee who h« foUowed him, referred a great deal to the history of our previous reUtioas with Chin«. The hon. member for the West Riding (Mr. Cobden)^ passed an eloquent eulorium upon the fair dealing and humanity cf the Chineseland spoke in terms of indignant reprob»tion of the conduct of tas own countrymen. Heh*d described our officUUas insolent »nd overbearing, our merebnts as greedy of gaia and actuated by the lust of conquest; »nd he had endeavoured to illustrate our reUtions with China by imagining wh»t they would have been with France or America TmdersimiUr crrcamstances. There was no foundation for »ny «uch P"*11^ HefMr. Cottier) was not aware that in times of peace Englishmen had ever been refused »dmissioa into either Freach or Amencaa towns, or that if they strayed about French or American territory they raathe risk of bemg murdered or tortured. From any fair comparisons between pur conduct »nd that of the Chinese he felt confident that we «hould not suffer. Sup pose that America had bombarded our seaports, would the noble lord at the head of the Government have issued a reward for the head of every American who might be cap tured? Depend upon it this eulogium of our enemies, whether Russians or Chmese, and this depredation of ourselves, was neither wise nor statesmanUke. (Hear.) The Chmese, it could not be denied, had been guilty of a violation of the treaty, such a vioUtion as we should not have put up with from any strong Power like France or America. The population of Canton had beea representedat one moment»»turbulent and at the next as peaceable and inoffensive. He believed that the popuUtion of Canton were turbulent and unruly, but that their turbulent passions were excited by their HP'ernment that they were hounded oa »gainst us, »nd that their turbulence was then used as »a excuse forthe violation of tteir treaty engagements. (Hear.) The noble lord (J. Russell) had put the case of erautiag passes to certam vessels m the Mediterranean, and had askedwhether the Spaniards could not board such vessels in their own waters for the purpose of apprehending a malefactor. ¿he cases, however, were not parallel, because tha Sçaniards had not given up their right, and we had a treaty with tte Chmese by which they gave up their rieht tHf*f·^^ ?? ««cle9 of the treaty the Chinese relia íííürüLfte" rigbtof searching English vessels, »nd by the -«»article the lorcha in qaestion was clearly constituted »a English vessel. He contended th»t the treaty was no better than waste paper if this lorcha were not »n English -: vessel under the 17th article. TheEngUsh «uthoritiee*n»d . clearly a right to grant registers to vessels of thU kind belonging to persons who were domiciled at Hongkone·. If the Chinese authonties thought we ought not to have granted »license to» person not resident in Chia», they ought not to have disputed our right by force, but shonld have apphed for redress to the British authorities. It was said that the date of the Ucense had expired, but was the Crown bound to enforce the forfeiture of a vessel in every case where the Ucease was not renewed on the very day?_ The Queen's Advocate appeared to be clearly ofopmion(p»gel5of the blue-book), that the «ot of the Chinese »uthorities constituted »n infraction of the treaty, and that, even if the Ucense had been improperly granted this was » matter of British internal regulation which would not justify tte seizure of the crew of the lorcha. Theyhad heardagreat deal during these debates of the Christian character of tte House, There had been few debates m which less of it had been dispUyed, but it waä reserved for a bosom friend of Sir J. Bowring to tura the error he had committed fif it were one) into « flagitious crime. What was the redress that ought to havi been sought and obtained for this outrage? Consul P«kes in his first letter, desoribed the measures he took and the representations he made to the Chineas authorities, which were of the most moderato and reasonable character: Yeh s answer to the appUcation made- to him was most evaaye and unsatisfactory. His attention having been expressly called to the insult offered to the British lag, he at once ran off to the charge of piracy «gainst aportioa of the crew, and afterwards set up the excuse-which he must have known to be frivolous -that the lorcha was aot British b^i.4vH. Co^ïarkes had accepted this pleaand put up with the insult, he would h»ve beea severely bUmed by thosewhowerenowloudestb<»ndemnmghlm. Theconduct of the Government, too, in endorsing his »cte, would have furnished »fine theme for the vague.declam»tion of the hon. and learned member for Enniskfflen, who would then have favoured the House with « torrent of invective equaUy as strongas that which he poured, forth the other, night but running in qaite the opposite channel. Consul Parkes and Sir J. Bowring were bound to demand gome reparation for the outrage on our flag ; «nd the quesboB was, were the terms they put forward unreasonable? He believed they were not. Yeh's letters were a tissueof subterfuges and excuses. He held one Unguage towards Sir J. Bowring, »nd another towards hi« own people. He talked to us of appeaU to tte Spirit of Heaven, while he was publicly offering rewards for our couatrymensheads. As to the demand for admission to Cinton. it shonld be observed that whatwas sought was a mere diplomatie entrance, not aa iadiscriminate entrance for 2ffi»y·. True, we had previously waived our treatyrights m this mjtter for »time, but when those rights had wS^ÍÍ l0^ » «other point we were justified in insisting that tte, entire series of stipulations «hould henceforth be ftufiUed. We did not, however, even now insist on _ our stnot rights, but only on a part of them, wbch was absolutely necessary to prevent future embroflments. To Uy down the propositioB th»l, under no circumstances, should injunes to British subjects be forcibly redressed without a previous reference home, would be matenaUy to impair the position hitherto occupied by Englishmen resident abroad. Withnations, as with individails a prompt demand for redress tended to prevent therepetitioa of oatrage ; «ad the employment of a smaU force «t the beginning nught obviate the necessity for calling in a great «me m tte.eni The House would not be warranted inlaying that Sir J. Bownng had been substantiaUy in the wrong ; and it must be remembered that the mere f*ct that all his acts were not such »s hon. gentlemen would h»vo done themselves would not justify them in supporting this ?°??,..- adoPtion of the motioa would be bterpreted by tte Chinese as »confession th»t weh*d been in error from the outset-that it was our duty to make aa abject-apology for what we had done, to restore their forts, and reimburse them for their losses. buch *u»ckBowledgir.eBt would prob»bly«lso be foUowed by a. claimfor compensation on tte part of the Americans. Governor Yeh, the ruthless sUyor of 70,000 of hU own pe?>l'i*.8? ,d np ?? men who talked loudly of humanity, and obtrusively of tteir own consciences, »s a paragoa of moral perfection, and » model for »U Christians to imitate.

(Cheers.) It wasnot too bold a metaphor when juristerepresented Statesas moralpersons, tterebydescribing them as bemg bound by tto Uws of moraUty equaUy with individuals. (Hear.) These high grounds, however, the Attorney-General desired the House to discard, »nd invited them to descend with ?? to consider the pecuUsr Unguage »nd structure of the documents before them. However disagreeable it might be to leave the higher ground, where the atmosphere was purer, he should be ready to meet ?« hon and learned fnend even in theso close lists which he had' chosen, »nd in which he stood ready to receive aU corners. Ho certainly had been rather astonished to leam from tho speech of his hon. and learned friend that during the whole discussion of this question, both there and elsewhere, the l^und upon which it had been placed had been entirely mistaken (ironical cheers), and that, instead of resting it upoa the basis of the ordiaanoeof 1855, it could only bo argued upon the supplementary treaty of 1843. It was verv surpnsmg that aU the »ble «nd powerful mind3 which had been »pplied to this question should h»vogone so completely astray, and it was stffl more remarkable th»t our plenipotentiary, whose »cute »nd subtle mind hadhe Uved in the times of tte.schoolmen would probably have earned for him the title of the second " Irrefragable Doctor" (laughter), should himself have been so entirely misled as to the true ground on which his case oughtto rest.

A new system of registration was then established, and S was nwvided that Chinss* readents within the eoloay should be entitled to ajpljr for and obtain colonist register if tbey held wcietêfêáTêasoi of Crown'Íáñds in the colony He í sked the House to obsbrre tho distincties preserved by the ordinance between vessels ownedhy British subject »nd vessels of »nother description," which wore the objecte cf this peculiar colonial register. Thero might be grei doubt whether that ordinance was legal, »nd whetherit hid not the effoct of repeaUng the .Merchmt Shipping Aet,,io far »s that Act dealt with the ownership of vesseU »ud th» consequent registration. The 547th Motion of the Itcrohiut Shipping Act of 185I first gave power to the colonial bifixtures to repeal »ny ofthe provWons of tho Merchant hipping Acts, and colonial ordininoci repealing tho provisions of those Actj did not become law until they were fancboncd by Her Majesty in Council, and such approval was proclaimed, or until the Upea of a ipociued time, after »hey had received Her Majesty's sanction. This'ordinance had certainly uot been sanctioned in any way when the proceedings with regard to the Arrow took plaoe. It was m November, 1855, that the Secretary of State for the Home Départaient gave a somewhat sollen oonsent that the ordinanco might be permitted to eome into operation. The House would observe the difference that existed between the_treaty registration and the ordinance registration. The registratipn under the treaty could only ba of British shlpi : tte colonial registrations underthe ordinance might be of Chino» residents who were also Crown lessees, TûerogIstrationnnderthe treaty w»s not temporary, but permanent ; for the House would observe that the register was to bo IeUvercd to the proper officer »t the Custom-hcrue when the vessel arrived in port, »nd given back again when it cleared cut, so that it was a permanent registration; hut th« registration under the ordinanco was only annual. It therefore. appeired clear Out;the registration under the ordinance ww something totaUy different from that under the treaty, and that the House had to consider this question on the footing of the ordinance alone. Nov, what was the fair legal offe'st of that ordinance l Undoubtedly, supp-ning that it was not opposed to any Imperili Uw, that ordinance might confer rights ? »garnit ourselves. (Hear, hear.) A register under that ordinance might perhsps bo entitlod to respect from foreign nations; but ho apprehended that it could confer no nght whatever on Chinese subjects as «gaiast tho Chinese Government. (Cheers.) That was the opinion cf bord i-yndhurst, who expressed himself very clearly and strongt* on the subiect. He said,- , "Allow me to lay down » principle which noon* can successfully contest. You may givo rights ?? »gainst yourselves. You may pass a Uw for that purpose, but yott eannot give any rights to the subject of» foreign country by itolymilm as »gainst the country of which heis a subject. Oh ! but, s»id tho Attorney-General, tho noble »nd learned lord, for whom he professed tto utmost reverence and lespeet, was entirely in error, and it was a most remarkable thing that he was utterly ignorant of «n authority on the subject which was completely decisive »gainst hi» views. (Hear, hear.) Lord Lyndhurst ignorant of tho hwl (Cheers.) TheATTORNEY.GENERAL.-I said no «uchthineI said no «uch thiag. (Cheers.) I »id Lord Lyndhurst teemed not to be aware of a certain »athority, but I »ever »id he was ignorant of the Uw («o we understood) ; tat the hon. »nd learned gentlem»a does not Stem to understand the difference. (Hoar, hear.) Sir F. THESIGER had only to say that he had seea what appeared to him to bo an accurate report ot the Altóme v- General'i «peceh, «nd he certainly found these words:? · J*i rcmjrfcabb that the noble »nd learned lord who insisted^oathistopio in »nother placo was not »ware of this authonty." (He»r, hear.) Now, ho thought th»t if any one in that House versed in the law had veutured to address Lord Lyndhurst and teU him he was ignorant of any authonty on a particuUr case before him, he might answer as Serjeant Maynard was said to have done on a similar occasion, "I have forgotten more thiu you ever knew." (Laughter.) The case to which the At torney-General referred was one which was famfflar to oveiVbody connected with the law, and was not likely to be overlooked by so great an aathonty »nd so learned » person is Lord Lyndhurst. (He»r, hear.) But ho must ?? th»t when the Attornoy-General contended that the authority to whichhereferrodwasacomplete answer to Lord Lyndhursts reasomng, and, moreover, that it was a complete authority to show that the superintendent of Hongkong had a rightto givo to a Chinese subjeot a register that would entitle him ?? against Chmese authority to become a British subjeot, ho wonldnotveaturo tosay that he was ignorant of the case, bat that » more complete misrepresentation of » caso he hid never hoard. (Hoar, hoar.) Wh»t was that case? A person who was a natural bora subject of England removed to the TJaited States with hia family with the intention of settling there, was domicUed, and became a naturalised subject of the United States. Under» treaty with America, confirmed by Act of ParUament, citizens of the United Steifes were aUowed to trade with the East Indies in '« particular article, which »t that time no subject of En»Udd could do. The person »Unded to had been for a considerable tune engaged in tho trade. He was the owner of several vessels and tho master of ono of thom, »nd tho question wïs whether ho, as « domiciled, naturalized subjeot of the United States, was not within the terras of the treaty arid ? iA 151 i*rliament-whether he was not sufficiently clothed with the character of a citizon of the United States to entrilo him to have the benefit of that particular treaty (Hear.) There were great authorities, as the hon. »nd learned gentleman told thom the othernight, who thought he was not entitled to the benefit of the treaty-suctás Lords Stowell, Eldon, aad Redesdale : »nd ia »caso very similar, relating to a SwedUh »'abject, Lord Hard wicke was of the same opinion. But certainly the hoa. and learned gentleman 'did not express himself with his usual accuracy when he enlisted »U these great names in support of hisjviews on this question. He (Sir F. Thesiger) had looked into· the record, »nd he thought tho hon. and learned gentleman was mistaken when ho so expressed himself. He could not conceive how it was possible on such an authority to establish that a Chinese resident, not domiciled at »U, and having no rights whatever ?» Bntashsubjeot, could under this annual register be dotted with tho character of a British subject, and be entitled to »11 the privileges which wero cUimed for him in* virtue of the colonial ordinance. (Hear). The Attorney-General was'a Uwyer ?? aaqaeshoiiableominenco and experienbe, »ndhe could aot presame he was ignorant of this authority, for he had himself referred to it; but certainly it »ppeared to him that he had entirely misunderstood it when he put it forwardas »n authority that was decisivo on his side of tho queshon. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and learned gentleman »lso chose to advert to another point oa whioh he had the misfortane to be at issue with him, and he found it necessary to correct the information he had conveyed to the Honse. He said ttat tho respect whioh was due to the British flag aad the Bntish paper known to bo possessed by the owners of this vessel ought to have eatitled it to protection withont the Chinese entering into an examination of these matters, and he quoted as an »uthority an isolated passage in » judgment deUvered in the Admiralty Court, amounting to something Uko »a abstract proposition. HecuUed this Mssago c»refuHy from the particulars of the case, and put it boldly beforo the House as an »nthority in his favour It was from Lord Stowell, »nd was »s foUows :- t "It is »known »nd established rule with respect toa vessel that if she is navigating under the ??? of » foreign country she is considered as bearing tho national character of that naboa under whose j»as3 she saUs ; she m»kes » p»rt of its navigation, and is in every respect Uabletobeconsiderecl as a vessel of th»t country." That, no donbt, w»s.»t first sight startling. Everybody who heard such a .proposition from such an authority and passing through «uch » channel was naturally enough »pt to be led »w»y by it. Let him tell the House what the oase of the Vigilanti», paraded with so much pomp by the Attorney-General, reaUy was. The Vignanti» was » vessel sailing under Prussun colours. She belonged to » native of Holland. At that time wo were at war with the Dutch, but Prussia was a neutral State. An endeavour had been made to giva the Vigilantia a PrussUn character by granting her, in some form or other, a certificate from tte magistrates of Emden, that tte assumed owaer of the vessel was » native of that city. The result was ttat she saUed under Prussian colours and carried Prussian jiapers : but, when Lord StoweU Uid down the proposition whichhad beenread to the House, he did so with » number bf qualifications which of coarse wero whoUy omitted by the Attorney-General (" Hear, hear," and a laugh) ; and though he admitted that faima facie, a vessel sailingunder the colours of »p»rtiouUr tate must be assumed to belong to that State, yet, the papers of the Vigilantia having been overhauled and found to be fraudulent, the vessel, whioh was protected by the general propositions which the Attorney-General had put before the Houso, was condemned as a prize. (Cheers.) He must say, therefore, that the House had not been treated ia"??. (Hear, hear.) They had had to consider a caso which aU agreed to be » difficult one. They had heard of contradictory opinions expressed elsewhere. They were anxious for some Ught to be thrown upon the question. The ¿tonus »indice nodus had arrived. The hon. »nd learned Attorney-General had descended among them to enlighten their ignorance and to dissipate their doubts ; and, after exhsbibng to their »stonished eyes a few feats of inteUeotu»! legerdemain, had disappeared in a cloud of authorities. (Cheers and Uughter.) He had endeavoured to track the hon. and learned gentleman's course ia the dark, aad to turn the light of his feeble understanding upon it; and he askod the Houso whother they were now «? prepared to receive without hésitation tho propositions of law whioh were maintained the other night by the Attornoy-General as they were at the time they wore deUvered î (Hear, hear.) What, then, was the position of tbe4 question before them! Ho conceded that it must turn entirely upon the right of the lorcha Arrow to be regarded as » British vessel, and that entirely upon the footing of the ordinance. Now, let them suppose, for the sake of argument, that everything must be in favour of tho"view which was taken on tho other side-that the ordinance was a legal ordinanco, and that the register conferred apon the Chinee« resident the right during its existence to have she tentporaiy character of a British subject. ,But the register had expired at the time of the bo'arding of the Arrow·. »nd_ whatever rights h»d been' enjoyed under tho ordinance weie lost in consequence of the certificate not being renewed, (Hear, hear.) The Lord-Advocate, in adverting to tho letter in which Sir J. Howring «aid, "it appears, on examination, that the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag; the license to do so expired on tho 27th of September, from which period she has not been **-i4-ÏM*ji 4a*i*iiIuí!··.

However, grantmg tho insult, what ought to have been done ? Why, as the hon. and learned member . JÎl iok had pointed out, the Queen's Advocate advised the Government what was aU that would be requisite anon the occasion-viz., the seizure of an imperial junk. J-hat was considered to be the sort of reprisal which would satisfy the demands of the case. Flag for flag, junk for J?Di!i'rSU0? W!ö t'18 !»w laid down the other night by the rignt hon. baronet the member for Carlisle ; but the seizure ^ff^r ?5ad^already taken place. ?? insult had been onered to the Bntish flag, and it was resolved to resent it ?? offering a similar insult to the Chinese flag. Accordingly, Commodore ElUott seized what was supposed to be an imperial junk, but, according to the bitter complainings of Yen it turned out to be a trading vessel. Yet the intention of the British authorities was to seize an imperial junk ; and if, as was argued by those on the other side, the acts of the parties were to be judged by nitenfaon, no more ample retaUation could have been desired for the insult offered to the British flag The matter might safely have been left there, or, at aUevents, further proceedings should have been suspended until the receipt of instructions from home. (Hear. ) There could be no doubt that the authorities in China beUeved that the insult to tte Bntish flag had been completely redressed, and that the idea of taking advantage of the opportunity to compel admission into Canton by force of arms was an afterthought. ile must say, therefore, that the Government had no right to claim anything for tteir humanity and forbearance. They began, undoubtedly, by attacking the distant forts; they proceeded to batter the walls ; they directed their artiUery against the house of the Chief Commissioner, surrounded ny many dwellings; and imagine the slow torture of firing guns every five minutes-conceive the agony of dread and suspense m the interval ! Why, a hot fire continued would hardly have been more fearful than the anxiety which filled every mud during the dreadful interval. (Hear, hear.) He was old enough, unfortunately, to remember the bombardment of Copenhagen. A mighty »rmament left these shores Which u was quite impossible for the Danes to resist; but they made a feeble showof opposition, and for three orfour days they endured the bombardment ot their town. He (Sir f? "eager) was a witness of the dreadful conflagration. The Joss of life was immense, and in the midst of aU those horrors there came forth a voice, as it were, from the flame?, which, after depiobng the carnage that must have happened ^dtheappearanoe presented by the heaps of slainfand after descnbing the striking down of a woman with a chüd ^Åm^JS- 1???1^ °î, ? sheU> buK* out into this Ä£"f*p0íír0ph<,· 0h' Britam' Qaeen of Nations, mother of such manly sons, can you suffer such unjust and ^Ä*?

He reared that the humanity and generosity and love of truth on which we had pnded ourselves would receive a deadly ???? from this transaction. (Cheers.) The noble lord tte member for London stated that he found ia the despatches no single expression of sorrow or regret on the part SLi Government f or »U the blood that had ¿een shed, and the learned Lord Advocate said that he thought there was no occasion for such aa expression. He (Sir F. Thesiger) deeply regretted ttat sWe Aí***68 w^ 5°t.to J38 found k the despatches; but he was much »stonished and pained that men of worth gentlemen of education, noblemen, ministers of the Gospel, and dipitanes of the church, should be found, some to raise their voices, many to give their votes, in approbation of the pweedrngs at Canton. (Cheers.) He could not trust himself with utterance of the feelings of sorrow and shame and indignation which had burned within him apon perusing the papers which were before them, aad which would remam a lasting monument of the bad faith and cruelty of the British ; but he never could have enjoyed one S^n^^^^HVi1?1^^ «»g611? »nd »nriously the opportunity which had been afforded him by the resolution of the hon. member for the West Riding of pronouncing his hearty »pprobation of that resolution »nd ^e^Pressmg thereby his horror of those proceedings. Sir W. F. WILLIAMS would h»ve given » süent vote oa this occasion, but that he had a duty to perform to his country and himself-to his country, because he was going to offer explanations whioh he was sure would be received with pleasure by both sides of tte House-to himself, because he must inform them that for 26 years he had served his country ia the East, ia those portions which Uy betweea the Bosphorus »nd the waters of China. Previously to the first war he was ia those waters, and he saw the Chinese in thecoloniesof Singapore, Malacca, and Penang pursuing tteir commerce and enriching themselves under our laws. He saw them treated with every possible kindness, and ? completely protected as EngUshmen; but during the whole of that time those insults and injuries were being offered by the Chinese whichled tothe first war, and to the stipuUtoons in the treaty which terrninatedit, which conveyedtous very great power in China with respect to our comuIs and the shipping on the coast. LordLyndhurst had stated in anotta place that when we were talking of treaty transactions with Eastern nations we h»d » kind of loose Uw and loose morality with regard to them. He (Sir W. WiUUmsJtook that statemeat to imply that in those treaties we had stipulated f or an unjust amount of concession, andthat we had thus placed them in an inferior position to ourselves. He wished to explain to the House, however, that ttose nations ??? brought themselves into that position by separating themselves from, the famUy of nations, by treating their owa subjects of the non-dominant reUgion with the greatest injustice, and strangers who frequented their country with hornble cruelty. (Hear, hear. ) The hon. member for the West Ridmg commenced his address the other evening by finding to those treaties, and hesaid that they hadnotting to do with the treaties which we had made with Turkey and Persia. He (Sir W. WilUams) contended that they were identical, and that they had resulted from the same^circumstances whioh hadled to the last treaty with £ ?_?? had 4?? ? Talkey for 16 years, and he saw so ÄÄJ *£ oPPreffon exercised, not only towards the Christian subjects of the Porte, but towards strangers, that he was persuaded it would have been quite impossible -for English people to Uve there if those treaties ¿ad not existed which we had made for the protection of our subjects. Precisely the same ?????? applied to Persia. ±te had been in that country also, and he defied any Englishman to remaia ia it * day unless he was protected by similar treaties. Instead, therefore, of talking about meting nut injustice to the weak and truckling to the strong, we should remember tte bearing of these E,stern nations -to ourselves, and we should find that the superiority which we had found it necessary to assume over them «atirely resulted from their separating themselves from tho great family of mankind. (Hear hear) The hon. member for the West Riding had paid a high compliment to the officers of the army an! navy, and he could assure him that those praises were received with great pleasure, but he hoped that when the estimates came to be discussed ne would not prove tobe one of those who thought that¡curtailing:our estabUshments ia time of peace made us Sght better in time of war. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman had also compUined of the document whioh had been laid before Parliament being garbled, but in making that complaint he had, in reference to one .document, stated that it ought to have been omitted alto gether, thereby displaying his real principles upon the sub ject. As regarded the statement that British merchants had lost a large portion of their commerce in the East -through their arrogance and insolence, he could only say that such was not the case. Where they had lost any part of their commerce it was because they were not able to lire in the same simple and economical manner as the native merchants^ or as those with whom they were brought into competition. With regard, however, to the real point at issue (hear, hear) he felt bonnd to vote »gainst the resolution, because he felt certain that tbe insult offered to the iinusii flag was a premeditated insult, and ought therefore jo oa resented, »nd »ny vote of that House in censure of the ÄS^Ä, wl)place "^lead to most daa--Mr. S. HSRBBRT.-At this hour of tho night, and »fter so lengthenedI » debate, I certainly shaU honestly endeavour to say what I have to say in words as concise as I can possibly make them, «nd I shaU refer as little as possible to those papers which I thiak we now know almort by heart. (Hear, hear.) Irose, Sir, in the hope of catching your eye when tho nght hon. Secretary for the Home Department sat down, for he gave us a chaUenge which I was anxious to accept-» chaUenge to discuss this question on broad grounds-ano? -that chaUenge I now accept with Pleasure. (Hear, hear.) I should like us to oi miss from our minds »11 the legal techaicelities which no doubt were necessary to be Uid before us, and which have been soadmirably stated, reUting. to the-righte of the parti -.«ulaf lorcha Arrow to bear the British fl»g.

(Cheers.) I «gree with Mr. Book, of theBoard
of Trade, who «ays that, the ordinance under which thes> Ucenses are issued is iUegah (Cheers.) I agree with Mr. Bridges, who wasthe acting Attorney-Gener«l for Hongkong who says ttat the British subjects to whom these licenses were issued were not British subjects »t all. (Loud Uughter aad cheering.) Aad, lastly, I «g^ *?? Mr. Parkes ttat if the Arrow had been IegaUy a British vessel the reparation wae far more th»a the occesioa required. (Reaewed cheers.) I «bo «gree with the Lord Advocate aad the right hon. Seoretary for tho Colonies, »nd with his absent friend in another place, the Lord ChanceUor, that these matters are perfeotly immaterial. (???, hear.) I wiU not revert to the question of the Arrow, but this I must say, upon the colonial ordin»nce in gener»!, that when I see it stated what are the objects for which these licenses are issued, I thiak the whole system requires the careful supervision of Her Majesty's Government, because whea I see it stated that tte state of Hongkong depends npon the prosperity of its coasting trade, and »t the same time I see that the ColonUl Treasurer tells us that tte coasting trade depends apoa the import of opium, &c, and when I recoUect that we axa bound by treaty tonse aU our authority, »ad, in fact, to do our utmoät to suppress that traffic (hear, hear), there »ppears to me to be some inconsistency (hear, hew) ; and when I hear of «n imult to the English flag I think it is time to look weU into aa ordinance by which the British flag is prostituted for wrongful purposes. (Loud ories of " Hear, hear.") Now, Sir, there is a subject whioh has been »Unded to, »nd I wish to clear »way aU this ground at once,-I mean the discrepancy between the two letters written upon the subject of this lorcha by Sir J. Bowring. The right hon. Secretary for the Home Department has this evening thrown the shield of his protection over Sir 3. Bowring, but he took no notice of that circumstance. I beUeve that ?? truthful nature revolted from it, but I wffl only say that I should have liked to hear it explained. It has not been expUined, and I think that it is a bad business for us as EngUshmen, and the less that is said about it the better. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, I come to the much more important question ofthe right of entry intoCanton,aboutwhichtherighthon.SecretaryfortheHome JJepartment has made some assertions with which I wish to deal. The hon. member for Hastings (Mr. Robertson) read to the House several statements showing us what thé chatrÄ. í ^ef6."*?0^ ^ha ri£ht· hon· gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department adopted tho same tone. He read »n extract from a letter writteh by S,D).bme-l0älx gentleman (Mr. Cook). I don't know whether it was for the purpose of endorsing tte opinions contained in it. or whether it was for the purpose of gettüi' tí???? w tó eeSPease of the hon. gentlemaVthe ¿ember for the West Riding. If it was done with the first object I must say it was not weU calcuUted to insure success! because, as it happens, the hon. gentleman (Mr. CobdenThad f" Oh? 0ttf,t «?«*4 qnite « much »s Mr. Cook himself. ( Oh ! oh ! ' »nd cheers.) WeU, I »m »nxious to satisfy the minds of hon. gentlemen who cry, " Oh," so I wffl read an extract from the newspaper recorde ofthe hon. gentleman s speech:- ?""»" ." Injustice to the writerlmust say-»nd without the probíl,ie llíl' trw c111?' fed that I hadbeen guUty of a breach offaith-that he U as completely an aati-Chiriese «s »nybody I ever met. He wishes every success to everyone ?who wiU go »nd »ttaok the Chmese to make them ¿ore American and more European in their notions, »nd he would not be supposed to say » word to save them from »ny horrors that you may inflict upon them." Now, if my hon. friend had omitted to make ttat statement, J. think he would have empowered me to offer ?? iwZ-î0j!e nKhtbo^ ^ronet (S" G. Grey), and to say that this witness, Mr. Cook, was » hostile and an unwilling witness, who could not, however, snppress the truth as to the lmquitous transactions now sought to be impugned. Before I go further let us have a clear anderstandbg «s to tte character of the Chinese people. During this discussion, if anybody has shown any squeamlshness withregard to toe bombardment of » populous city »nd tte shedding of innocent blood in Ohm», he is caUed » "mango* mandarins, «nd then hon. gentlemen get up instances of insult »nd torture whioh occur among this senn-barbarous people, and we are asked what wo think of tte/%..:Now»h»Tlng,:e5dthe enrrent works descriptive of the Chinese, and accessible to «U of as, I wül venture to th?1"*! ?,* sentence my opinion of this nation.

ItTppears from the papers that the Chmese Government attached so much importance to our not having access to Canton, that when negotiations terminated with us they gavo honours and decorations to the commissioners who had brought tho matter to that successful issue. Clearly, then, this was not a question on which Commissioner Yeh conld deal without instructions from Pekin. (Hear, hear.) Under such circumstances, what was the notice given to him ! The subject was mooted on tte 24th of October. A letter was sent from the »dmiral to Teh oa the 30th. The commissioner answers in effect to that :- "Touare quite wrong; your Government has waived this claim ;" »nd he makes a diplomatic answor to what was to him » disagreeable jnroposal. Admiral Seymonr writes again on the 1st of November, »nd, no »nswer being given, Mr. P»rkes writes on the 3d, that the demand ? to be pressed irrespective of antecedents, »nd that if it U not granted " We are going to resumo hostilities."

Of course they had, or he (the admiral) would not have had any thing to do with the matter. The question was whether he wa3 to act at aU. Let me point out to the House » passage from a despatch showing how this general concurrence was obtained. This is rather an important nutter; »nd I am anxious that the House should attend to it, as it bears on the defence of Sir Michael Seymour It was necessary before this change of treaties was carried into effect that it should bavette coaseat of Sir Michael Seymour. The admiral may ??????? have asked Sir John Jiownng, when Sir John caUed upon him, to interfere, if he was sure he was acting on the sense of his instructions from home. What does Sir John Bowring say ?- ",. T, . , , ." Hongkong, Nov. 4,1856. ulf>·-! have to acknowledge your ExceUency's despatch of yesterday, announcing the resumption of offensive operations. I think under present circumstances it is desirable to convey to yonr ExceUency » copy of » communication draughted at the Foreign-office, and sent by Sir Geoide Bonham under Lord Palmerston*« instructions to the Imperial Commissioner on the 2Ut of August, 1S49. In a communication, dated the 6th of July, made to tte IadU and Chma Association by order of Lord Palmerston it is stated, "per Majesty's Government have no intention to renounce the nght of entering the city of Canton.'

(A laugh.) It JS the draught of a letter to be »ddreesed by Mr. Bonham to the Chinese Commissioner, »nd it is remarkable for the tacility with which my noble friond expressed himself in the Chinese style of phraseology. (A laugh.) That letter to the Chinese Commissioner, which is rather a minacious document, begins by stating that " the British Government has learnt with surprise and displeasure that the Government of Chin» has declined to fulfil the engagements of the treaties by which Britishsubjectswereto be »dmittedto free access to the city of Canton." Afterreciting the termi of the tre»ty of Nankin of the 29th Aigust, 1842, the supplementary treaty of the 8th of October, 1843, the treaty signed at Bocca Tigris in April, 1846, and the articles agreed on atCanton onthe 6th of Aprü, 1847, the note goes on to " These engagements, thus solemnly recorded, the Chinese Government has now declined to fulfil. But ihe faithful performance of treaty engagements by Sovereigns is the security f or peace between nations. The Queen of England rí? T^Sfd her treaty engagement to tte Emperor of China. The Emperor of China has not fulfilled his treaty engagement to the Queen of England. Why ??? the Emperor broken his word ? Is it because he is unwilling to keep_ his engagement, or because he fa unable to do so? 'if he is uBwiUing to keep hfa engagement, how can tho .British Government trust to the Emperor's word; Î? a ow "can there be lasting peace between the two Governments? If the Emperor is unable to keep his promise, because his word and his orders are not respected by hfa sabjects, how caa he expect that foreign Governments should show him more respect thaa his own subjects are willing to show; «nd wffl not foreign Governments be obUged to inflict on the Chinese people, rn order to repress their violeace, ttose punishments which tte Emperor fa too weak to be »ble to »ward ?

We know ttat toe Secretary of State approves the Judgment, th firmness, and the moderation of Sir J. Bowring (loud cheers) yxd especially of his respect for Ufo and property. (Hear When my right hon. fnend told ?? we were entirely mis taken, that Canton hadnotbeenbombarded.hecouldnot hav rt»d the despatch of Sir M. Seymour in which he says I ani now shelling the city." (Hear, hear.) In »nothe ?}?£? 5f "f? H M droP2inS «hot »t moderate intervals ( "Heir" »nd Uughter.) That fa the moderation which ha so pleased the Government. (Hear, hear.) This fa, how ever, too senous a subject to joke upon. (Hear hear) After all, when you have said the Chines »re » rascally set, and that as barbarians they are not to b dea^t with in the same way and with the same regard an forbearance as Europeans-when you have said alt this, o which I give you the f uU benefit, and also that you mus defend your servants wherever they may be, there then re mams this fearful case, that in »miserable quarrel, which wasnot worth half an hour's difficulty, which might hav teen settled by reprisals (hear, hear)-for, if one jonk wa not sufficient joa might have seized 50-you suddenly turn round upoa a new pretext, and, »fter destroying forts, you proceed to drop in ¿hot aad shell, ia order, »s my right hon friends has described it, to disperse a crowd-» proceedin m which, of conrse, neither »ge nor sex could be regarded »nd *U thfa for some lascaUy Chinese whom you you wish to caU British subjects. (Hear, hear.) I do no wish to say one word that could be hurtful to the feeling cf gentlemen who may conscientiously differ from me. know how different are the conclusions at which human in tellects arrive apoa tte »ame data. I wiU therefore no allude to other motives which should guide us in cases lik the present I may remind them, however, that «om barbanans Uke the Chinese may, seeing tto proceedings o our governors »nd our admirals, ask apoa what principle we act. I think I may ask those hon. gentlemen thesam question, and am assured that when they come before thei constituents they wffl be caUed upon to answer it then (Hear, hear.) I wffl aot press, it, as I know among thos who differ fromme »re geatlemea incapable of actin from any but tte highest »nd most religious motives but at the same time I cannot stifle the feelings within m when I read of these things.

(Loud cheering.) Mr. Serjeant SHEE, finding that many of those with whom he asuaUy acted entertained strong opinions upo thesubject, wasdesirous of explaining hfa reasons for votin »gainst the resolution. If the doctrine which had been Ui dowa ìaaaother place by Lords Derby, Lyndhurst, and St .Leonards, »ndreiterated in that ????? by several hon ??????? "eld good, then there was end to the treaty o 1?? He submitted that the true construction of tha treaty was that a Chineso ship, Chinese owned, Chines built, the property of a Chinese resident at Hongkong, »n registered by him at the British registry at Hongkong was to ?? intente and parposes »a English merchant «hip Unless that coaclusioa was arrived at the treaty was at an 'îxv ^treaty coatemplated two things-the reguUtion of the trade betweea British subjects and the Chinese in Chinese vessels, »nd the.reguUtion of the trade betwee JJntish subjects and tte Chinese in British vessels. At th time of the cession of the island the majority of the Chines populatioa were aot aative-bora Chinese, hut natives of th ? ? 'S.0« archipelago. The island of Hongkong wa ceded to the Crown of EngUnd, with fuU power! to m»k *"??.""? f.?r tb° government of the colony»s Her Maiest might think fit. Afterwaids it became necessary tomak regulations for the trade between Hongkong and Canton aad between Hongkong and the five other porta open to us J-here was to be no traffic between »ny of the five ports except in Chinese vessels, andif» native-born subject o i,hina wished to purchase goods at Hongkong, by the ex press provisions of the tre»ty he had to go to one of th nve ports, employ a vessel there, get a pass, go to Hongkone get the goods, take them back to the Chinese port, »nil·thea surrender the pass ; so that, between our new territory o Hongkongiad the mainland of China no trade wasper EU2fdTixcept,in Chinese vessels, belonging to Chines ports. It was clear that a Chinese ship, manned by Chinese belonging to » Chinese resident »t Hongkone. »n registered at the Bnfash registry at Hongkong, would no satisfy tte description of a Chinese ship. H»ving m»de tha provision for Chinese vessels, tte treaty made provision fo ? ,2?^?? Bntísh vessels-English merchant ships o above 150 tons, and British lorchas, schooners, and cutters o not more than 150, and not less than 75 tons. It could no be oisputed that tte meaning of aa English merchant ship must be the same as it was at tte time the treaty was signed »nd thea it wa3 not necessary ttat a British-bom subjec shonld be tte owner. The Emperor of Chin», therefore had ?? right to require, as a qualification for a British ship that it should be owned by » British-bom subject, siac that_ definition was first given by the Act of 1854 If tte House concurred in the construction first suggested by Lord Derby, in opposition to the Attorney-General' common-senso construction, it would, in fact, repeal th ' treaty ; and ttat was a very serious difficulty in the way o the resolution which the House was called on to»ffirm It had been «aid that these resideats at Hongkong were no Bntish subjects at aU, but a moment's consideration would satisfy any oae that they must be British «abjects ; for the 3d aad 4th of WiUUm IV., chap. 34 setting_ forth the qualifications of tto master o » Bntish ship, stated that he must be » n»tur»l-born JJnfash subject, or a person who has become »ach by tho cessioa of newly acquired territory. (Hear, he»r.) Th temtory having been once ceded the principle »ppUed that the nationality of the ship depended on tho residenoa of th owner. It h*d been s»id that tte case which had been re ferred to as decided by Lord StoweU was decided in time v.**îrîi.bBSlt.was expressly stated ttat the principles on which the decision restedapplied equ»Uy to » time of >e»ce (Cnes of "Divider ) Mr. EoüspELï, Palmer »ud Mr. J.

DISEAELL-I may say, for myself, that »s the di vision ??? not yet taken place, and as the debate has assumed its present character, I am, of course, anwffling to »ttemp to force a division. I caanot, however, help rememberin that m that other place which has been so frequently, and M i.thl"k' i? "regularly aUuded to in our debates, when motion for the »djournment of the debate was made on th first night » leading Minister of the Crown objected to th »djournment. (Hear, hear.)

I LONDON, !U.SDAY, MARCH 3,1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
The Earl of Dzun disclaimed the report of the pro eedings at anmeeting said to-nhave taken ee at hs house by wreeld con ernpOiry.
Lord Gwavnv in reply to lord xr i | that no change hadl taken place in the poidi,g
affairs in China, and that reinforcements hul been' sent to Bongkong.
Some other business was then desptched, after whi ch their Lordahips adjourned.
In the House of Commons, the adjournod debate upon blr. COZDDN'S resolution, that the pprs on the table failed to establish satisfacto* grounds for the violentineasures rsorted to at Canton, was resusmoa by
3r. R. PHMLLIOIiI, who, after divesting the question of matters which he thought did not properly belong to it, including tho right of entry into Canton, considered the main irsues to be, whther the war was just in its origin and righteous in its continuance; and, if not, what was the verdict which the House of Commons ought togive. He disuted the validity of the Arrow's register; he denied that she carried a British flag at the time of her boing boarded? as well as the British character of tho vessel, which he maintained, in opposition to tho ArroRyNL-GmzzAr, was not Bntish in the sonse of the Treaty, the rules of which, he said, were not laid down in accordance with the international law. But, assuming that the British authorities were right in regard to this vessel, he contended that the legal course of proceeding was by reprisals, seizing property in pledge; that, moreover, full sati6faction had been rendered for the wrong, and that it was not lawfal to make war or even reprisals for the punishment of a nation apart from reparation. He could see no evidence of main Jfdes or of intentional insult, on the part of the Chinose, that could justify hostilities, and, over and over again, Commnissioner Y had' disavowed any intention to affront the British flag.
Sir G. GREY said, he was anxious to avoid the legal part of the queston, which he was content to leave the House to determine upon the able, lucid, and convincing ch of the ATroR.Nz-GxN,uRa Every one convwrsant with the trade of China, he observed, knew that these lorchas were essentially not Chinese, but sailed under various European flags, as well as under native colours, and, with the assent of the Chinese authorities, enjoyed the benefit of their respective flags; and, if the outrage in question had been overlooked, it would have been a virtual abandonment on the part of the British authorities of that protection which our flag had afforded for years. Animadverting upon what he regarded as an unfair use made by Mr. COBDEN of P. communieation from Mr. Coox (whose entire letter, published in this journal, he read), and upon other parts of the proeaedings of Mr. ConDSq in relation to this question, especially his depreciation of character, which he characterized as disingenuous, he defended MIr. PAnEEs against the sneers of Air. ConBDns,andSirJonE BoWR1NG against the strictures of Sir JAMBS GlRAHAMr, observing that Sir JOHN had, in fact, been appointed to the office of Plenipotentiary in China by Lord AnEaNann's Government, of which SirJAirs hiunself was a member. Sir JA3sE, he observed, had laid the whole responsibility of these transactions upon the shoulders of Sir JoHN BOWRx'Q, but, as in the whole of his proceedings Sir JomN had had the full concurrence of Sir MIcAEn Srvyaoua, the censures cast upon Sir JoHN Bownixo were unfair, ungenerous, and unjust. The demand for the official reception of the British by the Chinese authorities, by virtue of the treaty, was made by Sir bL SEv-souiu. In conclusion, Sir GEonGwEwarned the House to hesitate before it came to a vote that would have a prejudicial effect throughout the world, in comparison with which the defeat of a Ministry and the transfer of power to a combination of parties were of minor importance.
Ifr. ROBBBTSON, in opposing the motion, observed that the lorcha Arrow was of foreign build, and, had there been no flag or name, there could have been no mistake. As to the animts, his experience of the Chinese authorities led him to believe that the affront was designedly intended. From personal knowledge, as well as from authorities, he depicted the character of the Chinese officials and the people in colours very different from Mr. COBDBEN'S portraiture. He thought access to the Chinese authorities at Canton was necessary; the restriction was a degrading one, intended to lower us in the eyes of the people. He cautioned the House against faltering and falling back, by passing a vote of censure uipon the Government, the effects of which would be disastrous and would not be confined to Canton.
Sir J. PAKINGTON thought Sir G. Giizv had been altogether unsuccessful in his attempt to defend Sir JOHN BOWRING. He regretted that the Government did not repudiate the acts of Sir JoHN and his coofficials, and at once recall them; he had heard, he said, no reason assigned for the approbation they had received, except the neceasity of upholding servants of the CBowN; and he protested against the doctrine that they should be supported at all risk;s. Declining, like Sir G. GBEY, to disonss the legal points, but, assumingthat the lorcha was a Bitish vessel, he believed, he said, that the verdict of the world would condemn the revenge taken for the act of the Chinese authorities as excessive. The accusations against Sir Jo1I BowV1BNG, he observed, were not limited to this affair; he had been charged by the Chamber of Commerce at Shanghai with having deliberately misrepresented the instructions he had received from the Foreign-office, thereby obtaining the consent of the merchants there to an arrangement to which they would not otherwise have awsented. This was another reason why the Government should not have left British interests in China in the hands of Sir JOHN BOWRXNG. With regard to Sir M. SEymoui, he believed that he considered it to be his duty to carry out the orders of his civil chief; but he could not conceal his opinion that he should not have shown himself so much the willing agent of a chief not competent to deal with matters of such importance. As to the revival of the demand to enter Canton, successive Secretaries of State had distinctly forbidden the onforcement of this claim by arms without the consent of the Home Government. Attempts had been made, he remarked, to justify our proceedings by the ebaracter of Commissioner 1ZT, but he hoped the verdict of the House would be influenced by other considerations affecting the character of this country in the eyes of the world.
Mr. COLLIER, in opposing the motion, insisted that the Chinese had been guilty of violating for 15 years a solemn treaty-conduct which would not have been put up with in the case of a strong Power -and they were now presuming upon our forbearance, and trying how far they could go. Under the treaty, the lorcha, he argued, wfas fully entitled to be considered a British vessel; an outrage upon it
committed; the application of Consul PARBES for redress and atonement was fair and reasonable, and the answer of Commissioner Yps evaded the demand without denying the insult. If the consul had been satisfied, and proceeded no further, he and the Government would have been generaUy and severely blamed. If the House affirmed this resolution it would amount to a concession that we had been in the wrong from the beginning; the Chinese Government would be entitled to reparation, and would demand an abject apology. By negativing the resolution he only affirmed that when a treaty was violated and the British flag insulted we were bound to exact redress and reparation.
Sir F. ThriGoan, after a solemn appeal to the laws of truth, justioe, and humanity, descended from this high ground in order to reply to the argument of the ATrORNEY-
GEER4.L, who had argued that the question of the nationality of the lorchs depended, not upon the ordinance, but upon the supplemental treaty of 1843. He (Sir FRixn{miC), on the contrary, maintained that, from the very terms of the treaty, it had nothing whatever to do with the question; that the proposition of the ATwitONxY-G&xzn& ought to be reversed, and that reliance must be placed upon the ordinance, and not upon the treaty.
le then argued that a register granted under the colonial ordinance, itself of doubtful legality, could give no right as against Chinese authority, disputing, in the course of his argument, the legal positions laid dowrn by the ATToRNxR-G -BRAnL upon this point, and contending that the House had not been treated fairly by that learned gentleman, who, he said, after giving the House a certain anount of intellectual legerdemain, had disppeared in a cloud of authorities. Sir FlEDETRIC then commented upon tho conduct of Sir JOHN BQwWso with reference to the alleged insult, which'Sir JOn was determined to regard as doliberate and intentional. He urged that when a reprisal had been made
uon a junk, there should have been an end of the a ir,; tut, although the insult to the British tlag had been completely redresosd, the British officials, by anafter-thought, resolved to compel their ad-
mission into CAnton. by force of arms. The papers before tlie Hou.se inspired him, he said, with sorrowr, ':hame, aud indigniation, audwrould rensaina lasthg monument of the bid fa.ith of England.
Sir W. WmLW4LS, in arguing against tho resoln.
Lion, observed that the superiority we uasumed over Eastern nations was Produced entirely by their own fault, they having separated themselves from the .gre&t family of rnankind. He believed that the insult offered by the Chinese to our flag was a premueditated one.
Ir. S. HERBERT dismissed the legal technicalities ey saying that he agreed with those who 'in the very papers thermselves admitted that the Arrow -was not a British vessel; that KENNEDY was only the nominal master; that the owners of the license 'Were not British subjects, and that if the lorcha Aiad been a British vessel the reparation obtained was far niore than the occasions required. This 'had been confessed by Mr. ConslI PainEns, and the 'officials thereupon cast about to find a pretext for -exacting further satisfaction from the Chinese. Sir JO}I 3owitinG, having got together a fleet, now -thought "circumstances were auspicious" for re*quiring the fulfilment of the artiele of the treaty 4stipulating for access to Canton, and, in spite of refpeated prohibitions from home, demanded the imnme-
iate concession of a claim which had been suspended 4so many years. It had been said that all these transactions had had the general concurrence of Sir M. SEYmOu.R. Buthow was it obtained? By whathe -characterized as false pretences employed by SirJosN BownyNo-, who had made, he said, a disingenuous 'use of despatches from home. Mr. HUxati'; then 'censured the conduct of the Government in commending the judgment, firmness, and moderation of -those who had inflicted so much siffering upon the Cantonese, and their respect for private property. He, on the contrary, felt the deepest indignation 4t force exercised with so little mercy on pre-texts so transparently fraudulent.
Mr. Serjeant SnEE said if the law, as laid down qLord DEitY and Lord LYNDHIURST in one House, -3i'by learned members ia the other, were correct, tlv& treaty of 1843 was totally repealed. He, on -the other hand, submitted that the law was corxectly stated by the AroRwPY-GENERAL, and that the true construction of the treaty was that a 'Chinese ship, Chinese-built, Chinese-manned, the property of a Chinese resident at IIongkong, xegistered there, was, to all intents and purposes, Xa British ship. Chinese residents at Hongkong, asince its cession, were, to all inrtenits and purposes, :British subjects, and, independently of this, the nationality of the ship depended upon the residence -of -the owner.
The debate was again adjourned, with the under-standing that it would finish this day..
Certain bills having been advanced a stage, and ,some other business disposed of, the House adjourned at ten minutes past 12 o'clock.
In the multiplicity of new, complicated, and
In the multiplicity of new, complicated, and -distant affairs that present themselves in rapid -succession to the political conscience of the Englishman, it is natural enough that he should be sometimes enibarrassed. That embarrassment is not a little aggravated by the variety of tests, rules, and zentiments current among us. There is the political, the commercial, and what assumes to be the ,purely religious view of difficulties, and a good many other views, many of themi so capricious and unreal as to answer no otber purpose than to zsupply tabletalk, or give a stimulus to political speculation. Even Englishmen, however, with all the pride of reason, aU the glory of independence, -and beset as they are with continual appeals to their piety or their benevolence for the solution of the smost dificult problems, have one very simple and unquestionable test which may help them a great -way in their difficulties. " By their fruits ye *" shall know them." They can appreciate the worth of a witness, an authority, or an adviser by his look, his manner, and his conduct. They cannot help having an opinion of vwhat they see and hear, 'and they can form thence some conclusion on other matters which they do not see with their o-wn -eyes or hear with their owin ears. So, when the British people are requested to set down the British 'authorities at Hongkong as rash, scheming, troublesome, inhuman, dishonest, lying, self-important, monomaniacs, and a good deal more, and, on the other hand, to believe the Chinese to be *the simple, innocent, guileless victims of a diabolical conspiracy,-when, in a word, they hear an episcopal homily expressly assigning to the English the part of " wolves," and to the Chinese that of " lambs," they may save themselves a great deal of trouble by just looking at the character of the evidence itself, and the way iu -which it is given. They know what is meant by a shifty witiess, an unfair witness, a witness who is very forward on some one point and carefully suppresses everything else, a witness who labours to produce a certain impression, and in ,order to do so has to flounider through a -continual quagmire of misrepresentations. These are strong terms; but wve never remember Englishmen of name and figure to come out so exceedinuly ill as several have done in Parliament in the attempt to blacken Sir JoHN Bownixa and 'to whitewash Commissioner YEH. Whatever difficulty there may be, or may be imagined-for we find no difficulty in the question between these two persons-there can be no difficulty whatever as to the way in which Lord DJsny, Lord ELLENBORouGu, the Bishop of 02FORD, Lord Joux .RUSSELL, Sir JAxES GRAHAM, and other Parliasmentary personages have treated this question. It is a way very offensive to the English love of fair play, but to the judgment of any real Englishman it ought to go far to settle the present question.
As these are strong termis, we wiU just -enumerate some of the artifices which have been practised in the course of this Debate, and for which no account whatever can be given than -that they are necessary to the cause in which -they are resorted to. It was not fair to represent Sir Jo}S Bow1RiNG as the only responsible person at the station, or as having an overwhelming -authority and influence. It was not fair to allege that the measures taken were his, and not in every sense the joint measures of Sir Joni3 BoWBiSG, Sir M. %SmxouR, Commodore ELoT, and COnSUl PARKES. It was not fair to represent anything as done with'out deliberation and the general concurrence of all those authorities. It was not fair to attach to the present Administration the responsibilty of Sir JoHX BOWRING'S appointment; It was not fair -to describe Consul PAREns as a mere clerk. It vas not fair to describe 'the display of feeling among the foreign merchants at Hongkong simply as an exlibition of the English national clarac-ter, and as if other nations did not sympathize with us. These are some of the artifices, only some, that have been had recourse to in this ]ebate, precisely in the same spirit that a dishonest witness at the Old Bailey might keep -out of sighit some material circumstances, describe somebody as alone when he had associates, or even imply a false alibi, if not directly assert it. It did not answer the purpose of these witnesses in Parliamnent to implicate Sir Id. SYviouxR or Commodore
MLLIOT; it was a strong presumption against the rashness and folly of the measures taken that all -the four officers named resorted to them after much co'sultation; Consul PARRES'S history -added to his. authority ; Sir Josi Bow-' RiNa's appointment rested on the responsibility of the very gentlemen loudest iu his dispraise. On these and other points the trut'
was very damaging. So the truth not only wsi mot told; a fictitious colour was industriously substituted. This was done with an amount of co'opation for the purpose indicating an actual ,conspiracy to ruin Sir JoseN Bow:Rau for a pirty -triumph. How else could the same colour, t4e same Suppression, the same perversion, run through so many speeches? How else could we have had men get up, one after another, temporal anI spiritual Peers, noble Lords, Right Hon. Gentlhmen and Baroneta, al1 with the samo story-that Sir
rokN- BowsNG had done all out of his own hez I from some stranggo motive of his own ?
Now, thia is a very simple affair, and everytoly
(an understand it. A cause must be bad which requires such frauds to support it. It is not every I nglishman who may have the experience of maritime and coloniat affairs sufficient to comprehend the exact character of a Portuguesbuilt vessel, manned by Chinese residents of a British colony, and employed in the coasting trade of China, with certain formal qualifications. On this two Chancelors are one way, one another, and a host of lawyers on tither side, always, however, on the same side as their politics. There are not many Engliihmen who have even seen the bulky Parliamentary returns; and even Mr. COBDEN, while quoting them, while declaring that he had read them, and while confessing to a sort of voracity for such books, made a great blunder, if not something worse, both as to the contents oi one of the books and as to the author, and consequently the motive of its publication. All these things require not very deep thinking, or much thinking, but at least a second thought. But it does not require a second thought for an ordinary Englishman to know that a case which requires all kinds of " cooking," suppressions, and misrepresentations, must be a bad one. If the case against Government or against Sir JoHn BoVniRG was a good one, why should a dozen gentlemen get up one after another with the same story that he did it all, and the others only did as they were bidden? The motive is too obvious. When aU is known of the four men to whom at this critical juncture the honour of our flag and the interests of civilization have been committed, we may feel very thankful that they turn out to be men of character, of experience, of humanity, of discretion ; and that the two civilians were remarkable for their knowledge of Chinese affairs. It is also a comfort to us to know that they have acted deliberately and in perfect accord. But it answered the purpose of faction to keep this out of sight, to detach three of the counselors and co-operators in this difficult affair, and throu the whole burden on the fourth. That accordingly has been done,, and Englishmen will not fail to see the significance of the artifice.
So completely for the moment is public atten-
So completely for the moment is public attention concentrated on our own affairs at home or in the East that we can hardly expect a question of continental politics which does not immediately affect this country to excite much interest. However, we are linked to the Continent for good or evil, and cannot long remain indifferent tothe relations which subsist between its several States. Every jealousy or intrigue, every tendency to a better understanding or to increased coolness among them, may one day affect the policy of England. It is therefore with feelings of more than mere curiosity that we have watched the growing hostility between the Austrian and Piedmontese Governments. The ill-feeling which has smouldered for several months has now burst into a flame. The notes of Count BUOL and Count CAVOUn, which we published yesterday, are among the sharpest State papers which have been penned even in this age of antagonistic principles and rival dynasties. Now, we need not say that our convictions and sympathies are all on one side. Sardinia possesses a Constitutional Government, a free press, a Minister who has shown himself an able administrator and a liberal Statesman. A6 country like ours is not likely to undervalue such a neighbour. We have, indeed, reason to feel an interest in the States which have preserved something of the political lessons they have learnt from us, for they are few and far from powerful. All over Europe the institutions of these islands have been imitated and parodied in every style, from the sublime to the burlesque, by restless communities for more than 60 years. Almost everywhere the flood of despotic power has returned and swept away the edifices built on the sands of popular caprice or pedantic theorizing. At the present time two spots alone have escaped submersion. Belgium and Sardinia, smaUl States, the battlefields of generationis, surrounded by great military empires, alone uphold the principles on which we pride ourselves. How, then, can we be otherwise than gratified when the Chief of one of these free Governments defends the liberty of the press against the Minister of an absolute Sovereign, and when we find that the vindication has been masterly and complete ?
The facts of the case may be briefly stated. Since the events of 1848 Austria and the Sardinian Kingdom have been in a state of antagonism. Austria cannot easily forget that at a time when her dominion was threatened with collapse the Sardinian KMG took the field against her, and Sardinia remembers with bitterness the defeat of CHA.rLs AnumrrT's ill-prepared army, the restr:*tions placed upon the entrance of Sardinian subjects into the Imperial States, and the sequestration of the property of the Lombard and Venetian refugees. The part taken by Sardinia in the alliance against Russia and the representations of Count CAvoun to the Conferences of Paris were not of a nature. to soften these animosities. For a year past the two Governments have not concealed their distrust of each other, while the press of. each country has given free play to that violence of invective which seems inseparable from the political discussions of the Continent. The visit of the Enmperor FYuACiS JOSEPH to his Italian dominions was the signal for this war of words to rage with increased fury. The advocates of an independent Italy were, of course, urged to new activity by what seemed an effort to seduce the Venetians and Milanese from their patriotic discontent, while the Austrian official journals replied with equal acrimony, and attacked the KnfG, the institutions of Piedmont, and the Liberal Ministry with a fluency of abuse which the most Democratic broadsheet could hardly hope to surpass. However, as is generaUy the case, the free press struck the harder blows. The Sardinian philippics may not have been more trenchant than those of the Austrian press, but they were felt to represent the sincere animosities of a portion of the people, and were likely to produce some effect in Italy. The FpEitoiP was personally attacked, and took deep offence. The consequence has been a note from Count BUOL to the Austrian Minister at Turin, complaining in warm language of the conduct of the Sardinian Government. The Viennese Statesman, after declaring that the E;iPERox was in his visit to Italy desirous to throw a veil over the past, and that his subjects appreciated and responded to his advances, acuses the Sardinian press of using every means to stir up hatred against the Imperial Government. " Calumny " and insult were hurled against the august " person of the EtpERnon, as well as against his "devoted servants; insurrection and even regicide
were represented as means to liberate Italy from "what they please to term a foreign yoke." The Sardinian Government is declared to have allowed complete impunity to the press, and to have, moreover, taken a hostile attitude by receiving deputations from Austrian subjects, and subscriptions for the defence of Alessandria from an Austro-Italian Committee. Of these instances of unfriendly conduct the Austrian Cabinet complains in strong language. Couut CAvoTm replies conclusively. He points out that by the Sardinian Constitution the press is firee, that the Governnment is not raspopsible for the excesses of certain journalists, that laws exist by which unbeooming language or unfounded calunniea :can be legalr punislied; snd lhat the tribunals of-Turih are olen to'the Austrian Minister if he should resolve on a prosecu-
ion for libel. - The Government of the KnmG, Ile adrits, saw with pain the violence of certain newspapers, anad would gladly welcome a change of tone, but the habitual language of the Piedmontese preas was not more hostile to Austria than the articles which have from time to time appeared in England and Belgium. Further-, more, no newspaper which rpoke a word against the ExPEROt or his poicy could cross the Austrian frentier, and therefore the actual influence on the Milanese could be but small. On the other hand, the official press of Austria contained daily libels on the Kixeo, the Royal Family, and the Government of Sardinia, and these newspapers were freely admitted into the Sardinian territory. If, then, Austria has cause to complain of independent jonrnals which none of her subjects are allowed to read, much more has Sardinia cause to complain of official or censorized journals which no law restrains from being read in every part of the kingdom. Count CAvoun further defends the system of free government which has been definitively established in his country. He enlarges on the benefits received from it, and declares that, so far from weakening, it has strengthened and consolidated the Monarchy. His note concludes by an assurance that, "while "resolved to maintain at all risks the institutions "which make the prosperity and glory of our "country, it is no less our firm intention to fulfil "towards our neighbours, to their full extent, the "obligations imposed on us by international law "and by treaties."
There is notbing in this answer which will fail to receive the assent and approbation of Englishmen. In fact, Count C.vouRtakes the sameposition as we took formerly when the press of this country was denounced and that of Belgium threatened by the absolute Governments of the continent. Public law is on the side of the Sardinian Statesman, and he makes thc best of his case. Yet we cannot refrain from a word of counsel to our Italian aly. We fear that the Sardinian press, and even the Sardinian Government, took occasion of the EAiPERoR's visit to be gratuitously offensive. According to the comity of nations and the usages of monarchical Europe, the person of a Sovereign is respected even by a rival State, and his presence in the neighbourhood of the frontier is generally recognized by congratulations, which are certainly not useless, since they indicate at least a disavowal of hostile feeling. Now, it cannot be denied that some of these expected formalities were needlessly omitted by the Sardinian Government. The Emperor of AusTrn& ascended the throne at a time when the disruption of his unwieldy monarchy seemed all but certain. To strengthen and centralize the empire became the policy of the military chiefs who succeeded in saving it from destruction. In the accomplishment of this object great injustice to districts and individuals has doubtless been committed. Italy, from its past history and faUen greatness, especially roused the sympathies of the world. The Emperor FxANcIs JosEPE came to this part of his dominions with the declared intention of conciliating his subjects by an a'leviation of their just grievances. He had previously given proof of spirit and independence by revolting from the vassalage in which the most powerful and astute of European Monarchs had endeavoured to hold him, by brealdng up the Northern AUiance, and maldng common cause with the Western Powers. FAsA,cis JOSEPH was more than formally the aly of King Vicrop EmtA,H%uEL, for his troops had held in cheek a vast army which would have reinforced those Russians whom the Sardinians met at the Tchernaya, and the Envoys of the two Sovereigns had just put their seals to the same treaty for the pacification of Europe. It would, then, have been decorous in the Sardinians to allow national animosities to slumber for a time, or at least to refrain from giving them a personal character by abusing the Er,nEsox and distorting his acts when he had come on a presumed mission of kindnens into a country which they profess to regard as one with their own. Surely, if Italy is ever to be anything but the home of discontent and evil passions, the first advances of improvement and conciliation ought to be welcomed rather than sneered at and misrepresented. The more we value the freedom and past progress of the Sardinian people, the more anxious are we that they should do nothing to discredit the liberties they have learned so well to prize.
In what light will these debates on the Chinese
In what light will these debates on the Chinese question appear to the historian who is considerix g the question some twenty or fifty years hence ? The two Houses will have each devoted mary valuable hours to the lorcha Arrow and its register, to the justice or injustice of demanding an interview vwith Commissioner Y1H ; but the fature historian, if by patient research he makes himself acquainted with the opinions of noble lords and hon. gentlemen who will then have passed into oblivion, will perceive that the battle has merely been one between those immemorial enemies the " Outs" and the " Ins." Indeed, the chivalrous adherence of each section to its leadeis is almost ludicrous in its completeness. Chancellors and Secretaries, in or out of office, Bishops and unofficial politicians, even Admirals and Generals, seem all to judge of complicated occurrences at the other end of the world precisely according to this one simple rule.
This, however, is nothing new. We do not speak without experience. The present are not the first Chinese debates to which we have listened. Seventeen years ago we heard all that we hear now, and in a much more Ciceronian and declamatory style. The Chinese were much greater people in those days. We had not come to blows with them; we knew little about them but their painted dragons and wooden field-pieces.' They were still the virtuous and powerful Orientals, with a paternal Government, an aristocracy of learning, and a religion of philosophy. Their weakness, cruelty, and cowardice, their tumults and their anarchy, their executions and mutilations, have come to light since. Likeo many other people, the Chinaman had somehow gained a reputation which no one cared to overthrow, and he received the benefit of it. In the full bloom of this good fame he came in contact with the British Power in the East. The Whig Governrment supported its officials as it supports them to-day. The subject was taken up at home. Need we state the result ? Every Conservative was indignant at the conduct of England against tbi. wise, this peaceful, this ancient people. There was another cry at the time which we do not hear now.-the danger of provoking the hostility of the first Power of Asia, consisting of 350,000,000 of people, united under the most solid of monarchies. On the 7th of April, 1840, Sir JAMES GRAHA-, the then expectant Home Secretary, introduced resolutions condemnatory of the Government. Ee spoke of the Chinese as a mighty people, all governed by one code of
laws, speaking one language, professing one', religion, and actuated by the same feelings of! national pride and prejudice. They traced back 'their 'history, not, like ourselves, by centuries, but by tens of centuries. They boasted of their education, their printing, their civilization, their arts. All, the conyenieneeg and many of the luxuries of life v*ere theirs irhoen Europe w'aas
still sunk in barbarism. Theirinuiireveniewaslt 60,000,0001. st6rling, ana they 2Oanal 1,200 miles in lengthb;one of1;l1e ,*ndetrsil-the iortd. This waa the people with whom the imbecility of
our Government had brought us into colliion. ! Then came the details. The Government were to
be condemned for allowing their Plenipotentiary to go to Canton, and to announce his presence by a lItter to the Viceroy, instead of a letter to the EMrPEROR through the Viceroy; they were to be condemnied for not enforcing certain Itoyal signmannal instructions under the China Trade Act, for not taking into consideration a suggestion concerning a mission to Pekin, for stating that our relations with China were amicable at a time when they were seriously compromised, and so on. All these notable charges were of course endorsed by every Conservative. Sir W. FOLLEnr, with the Solicitor-Generalship in full perspective, addressed the House, just as Mr. WHxrSiDz did on Friday night, in the severest terms against HER sArrsTY's Government. He was followed by Mr. SIDNEY HRBESRT, who soon afterwards became Secretary of the Adniralty, and who spoke just as he did last night, by Sir FR lf,R'i;, then Mr., TErsIGSE, whom promotion also awaited, and who repeated himself last night with the prospect of similar advancement, by Mr. W. E. GLADsToNE, who thus won his way to the Board of Trade, by Mr. G. PALErz, and VMiscount SA-ox (now Lord Privy Seal), in favour of the motion, and these of course alternated with an equal number of Liberals against it.
Now, what do we think, after the lapse of 17 years, of this mere party debate? It was a great event in its day; there were blue-books, from which members crammed the facts, and articles in which their speeches were criticized. There was much research about details that are now forgotten, the establishment of police at Whampoa, and the distinction between the outer and inner waters of Canton. On all these questions the politicians of each side came wonderfully to conclusions identical with those of their respective leaders. But what remains of it? Only the great historical fact whichb looms on us from the past, that in the year 1840 the advancing enterprise of England came in contact with the isolatedcfabric of Chinese society. The paltry datai-s whether this act was legal or the other a-t judicious have passed into oblivion. In the regular and inevitable development of the world it was necessary that at some period an adventurous maritime people like the English should force themselves into connexion with a feeble and unprogressive race like the Chinese, inhabiting a rich country open to our trade. That period came in 1840, and certain disputes, ending in the success of the more civilized nation and the settlement of an English colony, were the natural result. The change of Ministry produced no change of policy. The Conservatives under Sir RoBERT Pn soon succeeded in upsetting the Whig Government, which had begun the war, but they did not hesitate to cairy out all that the Whigs had begun, and Lord ELM-BOROUGH, who was even more declamatory against hostilities than he is now, proceeded to India, and carried on the war with a vigour, perhaps praiseworthy, but certainly inconsistent.
May we not fancy that 17 years hence, when British enterprise has effected stiU greater things; when China is opened through its length and breadth t'.o Europeans; when steamers have penetrated hundreds of miles up the Yang-tseE-Kiang and the Hoang-ho; when Chinamen are working on the cuttings for their first railways-when, in fact, under the benevolent tutelage of this country, these hundreds of millions are being brought into communication with the busy world, and raised in the scale of humanity and civilization, those who are then alive will smile at this debate about the Arrow, and render but a faint tribute to the declamation of Lord DERBY, Mr. COBDEN, and Lord JoHwN RussELL, or the legal subtleties either of Lord ST. LEONARD's or Sir R. BETrn ? An occurrence like the seizure of a petty craft is the occasion, and not the cause, of such changes as seem impending in China. Let us, then, understand things aright, and not forget the great stream of events in watching the little bubbles which rise to the surface. The concerns of England in the East are too momentous to be made mere party questions, aud the men to whom those concerns are intrusted - have a right to expect that their countrymen wil oppose themselves to such declamatory denunciations as we have lately heard. This kind of rhetorical indignation about aggression and inhumanity is the easiest thing in the world; but Parliament should have a wiser judgment and a better taste, and not imperil tho great concerns of the country in deference to the interests of party, or even the impulses of humanitarian prejudice.

It is understood that if the treaty is held in abeyance in the Senate until the 4th of Mlarch 3Ir. Jefferson Davis will give his support to it as it stands, notwithstanding the opposition which the Southern statesmen are generaUy supposed to cherish towards it.

A private despatch received by us is to the following effect:-
" BW ORLEANS, FEB. 17.
"The steamer Texas, from GreYtown on the 10th inst., has arrived at Belize. The steamer Tennessee, from Now York, with recruits and ammunition for Walk-er, has arrived off Greytown, as had also Colonel Titus, with his recruits from Kansas. Colonel Lockridge had proceeded up the river from Greytown and attacked and defeated 300 Costa Ricans, with a heavy loss to the enemy, and but a trifling one to himself. His steamer's machinery getting out of order, he was obliged to put back again to Punta Arenas. After repniring'this he proceeded up, and it was thought at Punts Arenas that he would in a week be in full possession of tle river. The advices from Walker's position are to January 3, received by the Orizabs. These advices are from Walker's agents, and are to be received accordingly. They say that the allies, under Covas, had made their appearance in the vicinity of Rivas, but 'were driven back. On the 28th of January General 3enningsen, with 400 troops, attacked 1,500 Costs Ricaus at St. George's, and after driving them from their positions returned to Rivas. Walker's whole force is rated at 1,300 men, of whom 1,1]00 are fit for duty and in good health and spirits, and having three months' supply of provisions and ammunition."
In the BurdeU case tho jury had returned a verdict of wilful murder against krs. Cunningham, Eckel, and Suredgass. They Were of opinion that the daughter3 of Mrs. Cunninglham were also implicated, and recommended their safe keeping. Suredgasssaid, in reply to theCoroner, "Iam entirelyinnocent; I know nothing whatever of the facts relating to the murder of Dr. Burden. If any one knows anything about the murder in the family, I think it is Miss Augast A. Cunningham, with the mother, understand me-that is, if the murder was perpetrated by any of the inmates of the house."
At New York a lively demand prevailed for moncy, and the market was a little more stringent. There was no positive scarcity of available capital, and the banks aud brokers were granting liberal facilities at the following rates,-viz. *-9 to 10 per cent. on first-class two to four months' paper; 10 to 12 per cent. for fair to good four to six months' notes; and 7 to 8 per cent. on call. In the stockmarket there had been a better feeling, though the leadingouotations indicate no material change. For prineipal State stocks there was a steady demand, and prices were weU sustained.
The Bank statement for the week showed a decrease in aU its items.
In exchange a large busine3s has been done; the market closed flat and regular; the range of prices of regular drawers were on London 8 to 8j per cent. premium; Paris, 6f. 231c. to 6f. 22ic.
In cotton buoyancy contmiued, oing to de-- creasing receipts at the ports and the favourable advices received per Europa, which caused an advance of Jc. per lb. The market closed firm.
Flour was without imnportant change. The low grades, which were more plentiful than fancies and extras, had declined 5c., with little inquiry at the reduction.
Canada flour was dull and drooping. Southern flour was without important change, the market closing steady at $6 90c. to $7 20c. for mixed to good state brands, $7 25c. to $8 for low to good fancy and extra, and $8 60c. to $9 for choice ditto.
For mesa pork there was an increased demand at

Last night tho effective forceo of this establishmont wag most creditably displayed in a revival of Mortona' Cure for the Heartache, a piece which, whatever opinion may be entertained of its literary merits, adequately employs a lare number of good actors, and which, compressed as it is into. three acts, can stiU command the laughter and the s7mpathies of an audience. Mr. Keeley, as Old Rapid, gives a highly-coloured picture of theblunt,honesteitizen, somewhat soporific in his habits, not very brilliant in his intellect, but overflowing with that kindly sentiment which was sO popular at the close of the last century; and for the " ahead" propensities of Young Rapid, expressed in
dlang phrase. "Push on, keep moving," a more volatile representativo could not be fonnd than Mr. Charlew Mathews. The talents of both are mostamusinglyexhibited in the scene where Mr. Vortex, one of those obsolete personages called a "Nabob,I attompts to rehearse his rarliaientary speech in the presence of the father and son, and is shocked to find that tho former drops fast asleep, while the latter is provokingly disposed to think of anything in the world ratherthan the specimenof oratory withwvhichhe is favoured. Mr. Keeley assumes to perfection that aptitude for dozing which belongs to a corpulent form, a sense oE worldly prosprity, and X not very familiar acquaintance with the demands of etiquette; and Mr. Mathews embodies the nervous restlessness of a man whose mental activity is revealcd by the perpetual movement of his limbs and his utter inabilty to fix his attention to any wiven snbject fofive whole minutes. The pomp with which Mr. Tilbury delivers the speech contributes much to the effect of the sitnation. But the boldesteffort is the impersonationof Frank Oat. lands by Mrs. Keeley, who not only speaks the rustic dialect, but makes of herself the thorough boy, strong in affectioi'
and quick of resentment. This model of raral virtue has generally been a full grown man, and doubtless the author of the piece would have been greatly astonished bad bet eeen a lady come forward as the representative of bl;ff, unsophisticated honesty. But MIrs. Keeley showed herselt thoroughly equal to the difficulties of the position, and by manner and appearace gave a juvenile interpretation to the text, which is quite as correct as any other, and whichl she sstamned with perfoot consistency throughout. The sately Miss Vortex was played by Mrs. F. Matthews, and the two young damsels, Jessy Oatlands and Ellen, wera sufficient y interesting m the hands of Miss M. Ohver and Miss Cleveland. The strong tone and character of A Cure for thc Hcart=chc aro now as old-fashioned as may be, biit the Drary-lane cast endows it with new life.

The lesson to the king is gven in the best spirit of plain-speaking inde pendence. An old Madrid audienoo, in the days that preceded the accession of the Bourbons, would probably havet preferred a more conventional foundation for the outbreak of marital feeling, but Mr. Dillon takes the view that cam. alone command the synpathies of the nineteenth century, resting rather on tho dignity of the man than on the prejudioe of the noble. It is not so much tho Count of Garofa thinking of his ancesto descended in a direct line from Tubal Cain, as it is thesnuma being declaring that on certain points all members of the human faumily are equaL

Mr Stirling Coyne, from whose pen it proceeds, has not, like Mr. Tom Taylor, changed the period in which the action takes place; but, while he allows the dramnaiu persAoni to live in the midst of the French Reign of Terror, he ao far modifies the incidents as to snake the husband rather than the wife tho principal figure of the story. In the original the concealed gentleman perfectly understands the lady's proceedings, and never dreams of becoming jealous. In this new version he is only a halfconfidant, and is nearly on the point of blowing out his brains when he lights on the draught of the divoroe,his aensitive temperament being further displayedbya very rave, Interview that takes place between himn and his wrould-bv rival. Moreover, the mother-in-law is struck out of the list of characters, and though Mr. and As.

PARIS, SUNDAY, MARCH L 6P.M.
Lord Palmorston declared, in the Eouse of Commonls, that he had no knowledge, beyond report, of the Convention said to have been conchlded between Rusia and Persia, and subsequentlt
that he had received from the Russian Ambassador the assurance that there was no foundation whatever for the report. The French. Mnisiter for Foreign Affairs has expressed himnself as also unaware of the existence of such a document; and the Russian Ambassador in Paris and the Persian Envoy, Feruk Khan, have likewise denied it. The patch of territory in question we all know has been long coveted by Russia; it would give her a splendid position; the pass of Bayazid commands the route to Erzeroum and Trebizonde, on the Black Sea; she has now no ships there, but Russia looks far into the future, and may not despair of seeing, at some period more or less distant, another fleet in those waters which her flag so long swept without a rival or a foe. But, if the Convention of Teheran reaUy exists, it would, after all, becmerely an additional sanction to the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmanchai, and to the various conventions, written or verbal, that have passed between Russia and Persia for the last 40 years and upwards. The price to be paid by Russia for the alleged cession of the triangle of which the apex is Mount Ararat, and the base Bayazid and Natchirvau, was said to be a corps d'aie and a garrison at Herat during the war with England. The promise of aId, succour, and support in case of necessity was already promised to Persia by the former of those conventions, of which the 4th clause says-
" Bis Majesty the Emperor of Russia in testimony of his sentiments for the Shah of Persia, and in order to prove to him his sincere desire of seeing his power and sovereign authority established on a solid basis in the Persian empire, engages solemnly for him and for his successors to afford, in case of need, succour to whomsoever of the sons of the Shah of Persia he shall name heir to the Persian empire, in order that no foreign enemy shall intervene in the affiairs of Persia, and that the Court of Persia shall be strengthened by the support of the Court of Russia"
Fifteen years afterwards the treaty of Turkrnanchai was signed. That treaty, it appears, contains a secret clause which specifies the nature of the " support " promised to Persia. Its purport is, I am told, that in case of an attack by England on Persia His Majesty the Emperor of Russia would furnish to the Shah of Persia, but on his express demand, an auxiliary corps d'armee.
It appears that the secret of this clause transpired when Chosrew Mirza was at St. Petersburg in 1828. In order to form a notion of the advantages secured
by it, it may be proper to allude to the events which! took place at the close of 1827 and begining of 1828.
At this period the Persian army, which had been I completely defeated, was in a state of exhaustion, and the Shah was obliged to sue for peace. The preliminaries were agreed on at Delk-Kergan,
but the treaty was not then signed. The condi-! tions imposed on Persia were of the most onerous kind. The fine provinca of Erivan was not o ly torn fiom her, but in addition an enormous war indemnity was imposed on her; it was of such an amount that it never has been entirely paid. The object of Russia was to render it impossible for the Shah to withdraw himself for a long time from dependence on her, and to profit by the advantage which these claims gave her to direct as she pleased the policy of the Court of Teheran. Abbas Mirza clearly saw the disastrous consequences of such a state of things to his country ; he therefore delayed signing Ithe treaty of peace, and seemed only to wait for afavourable mument for breaking off the negotiations altogether. Matters were in this state when Sultan Mahmoud declared war against Russia, and appealed to every true Mussulman to assist him. Persia was earnestly solicited to join her forces to those of the Ottoman Porte, and oppose the common enemy. Abbas Mirza was almost persuaded to do so, and preparations were made for war. His troops even approached Lake Urumeahb and passed the line traced by the armistice. It was at that moment that General Paskiewitsch, impressed with the danger which might result from this double war, determined to lose no time in dissolving the threatened alliance. He despatched to Tauris his aide-de-camp, Prince Koudascheff, with a confidential letter to Abbas Mirza. He intimated to the Persian Prince that he was perfectly informed of his intention to resume hostilities. IHe described in gloomy colours the fatal consequences that would folow from this new struggle, not only to the Shah, who would infallibly lose another portion of his states, but also to himself as heir presumptive to the Crown, who would be exposed to the intrigues of his brothers, and the right of succession again disputed. "C Before a year pa,sses over," the Prince wrote,
"Tho dynasty of the Kadjars wiU have ceased to reign. That which took place in the last war will again occur in this. Trust not to the promises of the English, nor to the declarations of the Turzks. The Snltan is in the most critical position. Our fleet blockades the Darda. nelles, and can starve Constantinople. Admiral iumnani is at the other side of Beurgas. Adrianople is awaiting the holur of ib falL The wiiU of the Czar is executed completely, and by troops whose valour is known to Europe. The Englishwill not defend you-their policy is merely directed by their interest in their Indian possessions. We, in Asia, can conquer a kingdom, and no one will trouble himself about it. In Europe every feet of territory gives rise to sanguinary wars. Turkey is necessary for the equilibrium of Europe, but the Powers of Europe care nothing as to who reigns in Persia. Your political independence is in our hands. All your hopes ought to be in Rtusiashe alone has the power to ruin you, and she alone can afford yout aSSistSnlce."'
Instead of having to fight Persia, General Paskiewitsch thought it would be a master-stroke of policy to turn her against Turkey; andinthesetent he thus alludes to it:-
"To give Russia a proof of the attachment which you have so often protested towards her, you must give a diU. fereat direction to the policy of the Shah. You must declare war against Turkey, penetrate into her provinces, and attack Van. From me you shall have arms and artillery, and the aid of my troops in your conquests,"
It was in this manner that the Russiau General tried to excite thoughts of ambition in the mind of Abbas Mirza and turn it to the advantage of his own country; to place before his eyes the tempting prospect of conquest in Asia, wrhich would more than indemnify Persia for the successive losses which she had sustained in the west. The verbal instructious given to Prince B:oudascheff wrere, that he should employ all his means of persuasion to secure the co-operation of Abbas Mirza in his plans. He wras to be lavish of promise, and officers, arms, and money were to be offered, to enable him to perform the great part allotted to him by Russia in the E ast. the envoy of General Paskiewitsch was even authorized to consent to a reduction of the annual tribute which.Persia wvas bound to pay as the wvar indemnity to R ussia. These offers were too seducing not to dazzle a Prince who, like Abbas Mirza, dreamt for his country the restoration of her ancient glory and prosperit"y It mus' not be sutpposed that he was unmindful of the danger resulting from the protection of a neighbour so powterful as the Czar. He had before him the grand prospect which excited his ambition, while the difficulties of his present position pressed heavily on his mind. The Persian treasury was
emtpty, ana yet he must pay his army and give it Qccupation, for without it he despaired of securing
the throne which his father was to leave him, and o a this point Prince Paskiewitich guaranteed the support of the Russian arms against the anticipated 9ppontion of his younger brothers. Under these circumstances Abbas Mirza acceded to the propo-
Bitions of the Russian General. He sent to Titis Ali Jus Bashi, a person who enjoyed his entire confidence, for the purpose of conferrin . with Pas-
kiewitach. A few days after, namely, on tte 10th Feb-
usry, 1828, peace was concluded. and signed at the village of Turkmanchai; this treaty brought the fortress of Eriv an *ud Mount Ararat within the domination of Russia, and made the Arares the southern boundary of her Asiatic territory. With
a viet to .iuture contingencies, Abbas Mirza sti
l Iated for the. insertion of the secret clause to w1dh I havereferred. He anticipated that the plan of conqrui -a Afighani3tu. enfotedaby Russia would

which, since the treaty of Turkanchai, have taken place almost withoat interrpt ion ;--t fitFiati K6brasan, then against the Tdrcooman tribes, and lastly against Herat, where at this moment the Persian flag floats.
The Russian Government succeeded in deceiving Europe as to her policy at Teheran. It was thought for a long time that Russia wouldmerely profit bythe embarrassments of Persia to wrest frora her some new provinces; but the views of Russia would seem to be of a higher kind. She was content for the moment to make Persia the docile instrument of her will. When she was seen lending her aid to place bn the throne the son of Abbas Mfirza all apprehensions were dispeeUed, and it was believed that s4e had renounced her projects of ambition with regard to Persia. A few persons only did not allow thenselves to be deceived. The young Shah had been advised by his real friends to organize his government, and establish it on a firm basis; but these friends were surprised to find that, instead of following their advice, he adopted the projects of his father, colleted an army, and proceeded towards the East against the Turcoman tribes and Herat; and from the nature of his preparations there was reason to suppose that his intention was to go much beyond that city. Then people began to be undeceived; but it was too late. Persia was already fashioned to the Muscovite yoke, and became habituated to receive orders from St. Petersburg. The evil is done; it is now our business torepairit without loss of time. The Russian Government does not lose a moment. What it wishes, and what it pursues with indefatigable perseverance, is that the whole of Central sia, from the Caspian to the Hindoo Roosh, from Astrabad to the Indus, ahould be consolidated in a vast confederation, of which it should be the life and souL "The Cabinet of St. Petersburg," says a person who has lived long in that city, and whose opportunities were great, "has one primary object in view, namely, that the keys of Hindostan shall be in the hands of Persia, in order to t-ake them from her in due time and at its own convenience."
M. Soyer had an interview with the Emperor at the Tuileries on Friday last. M.

The Camp At Colchester.
THE 0aMP AT COLCHEXSTER.
TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES.
Sir,-As you have admitted into your paper a representation of the distress among soldierz' wives and families at Colchester, may I beg the admission also of the present letter, which is sent, not for the purpose of asldng for aubscriptions, nor ofadding to the excitement on the subject slready felt by many, but for the purpose of showing to those who have aided us in similar circumstances with money, and have promised more should it be needed, in what way the money has been employed, and also in the hope that our expenence may be useful to the Colchester case?i
No exaggeration of the condition and suffering of soldiers' wives and families living out of barracks is needed; it noed only to be simply told to secure sympathy and hearty cooperation towards their relief.
We have had at Parkhurst Garrison, Isle of Wight, exactly the same kind of circumstances as those alluded to at Colchester, and not a whit less severe and grievous to contemplate; there has been with us suffering even to death, and so urgent that immediate help was felt to be a positive duty.
We proceeded to consider the case as one for the blessed exercise of Christian charity and private benevolence. Our plan was as follows:-
To collect from friends and neighbours as much as was deemed necessary to begin at once to afford some help.
To rent houses and furnish them with necessary articles ef furniture (each room bad one large iron bedstead, bed, blankets, sheets, &c., two chairs, one table, washing-tray, buckets, brushes, &c.) Each room was then let at from 7d. to ls. a-week. We have now nine houses, and 37 families thus decently lodged.
Our objQet was-1, to protect the wives and families of soldiers from the excessive demands commonly made for lodging rooms out of baracks; 2, to promote habits of cleanliness and order by supplymg vessels and articles for washing, &c.; 3, to encourage the deserving characters by aflowing such only to partake of the benefits of the plan; 4, to provide work for the women.
It is a rule that no soldier recently married is to have a room, and those with the largest number of children are received first.
There is also a separate fund for assisting those having large families with a little clothing, to enable the children to be kept at school. -
I would only add that the plan during the four months of its operation has fully answered the expectations of the promoters, but the want of proper lodging-houses is much felt here. The eagerness with which our rooms are sought is a proof that the money and effort have not been pent upon a case of common difficulty, but of real distress.
In the name of those who act with me I beg thus tothank all the friends who have helped us, and I am sure that the objects of this charity are also grateful for the work.
I remain. Sir. vour nhedAAnt. --..,

Sir,-I am glaa to see that public attention is drawn in your pages to the wretced condition of the poor gIs connected ith the Camp attieu raghof e ildare. Thre asta
of things is suchl generally in our garrison towns as to call loudly for somne efficient interference.
But prevention is better than cure. The beer house nan
gin palaces are thegrandinstigators to all thismiwchief. If not primed with dik, the poor creatures -would in met cases sbrink from their difficult career. But, more than this; it is a fact, of which abundant evidence presents itself, that the beer houses and gin shops have their regular stabe of prostitutes on their premises as a necessary appendage to their horid system.
I know one case d rhich uas pr penitent womann tted that she had often aand sailors and fallen girls ith oo,woaderyfacilty for retirinig from the dnefroerppss. hementioned other beer houses wihsmlraragm bs ut on a smaller sc-ale.
It may be asked, why don't the magistrateg and police prevent such nuis'4nees? But what can be expected When, perhap~s, the magistrate is a brewer, and his only object is to hthe sale of his liquor as extensively as possible ?
T=nw of one instance -very recently in which a brewer is said to have turned out one-of his publicans becauso he did not sufficiently push the sales of his liquor.
A-nd as to the police, it is well k:a6wn that they are often bribed by the publicans with a carte blanche to the tap whenever they please. How, then, can they be dspended upon for the upright discharge of their duty?
If potitution is to be diminished, with all its fearful mishif to bothsexe,-%theaxemust be liddat theroot of the tree, and the encouragements to drunkenness mnust be removed.
Iknow at this mnoment of .30 por girls in Portsmouth who would most thankully abandon their evil courses; but it is not an easy matter to know how to befriena them.
Hgow much better to cut off occsion from thowc who seek- occasion, and to dry up as far as possible the channlels of drunkenness.
Yours faithfully.

Sir,- Is it righbt that the French Government should imose vexatious- and unnecessary passport regultions upon 1aglish subjects, and on English ground? This they certainily do in Malta. The agent of the Messageries Imp6riales has instructions to refuse a passage to Alexandria to all perons who ha-ve not obtained the Turkish visa. This visa costs 5f. and a certain amount of time and trouble to obtain. The, regulation, therefore, is undoubt-edly vexatious. It is also wholy. ufinecessar ;be cause the visa is mever required of persons travelhn; byEnglshboats, nor isit ased forat Alexandria. Is it rgt
then, that the French company aheuld demand it? "i want to know, you know," and so I thought the shortest way wouldbe toastate the case to you ; nore especialy as; the agent, after receiving all sny other threate and rermonstrances with very irritating coolness, not to say contempt, bocame eviaently unessyatthe mention of 2'vte T.ms and even condescended to enter into explanations, which, however, were altogether unsatisfactory.

I . ~~Monday Evening.
The En&lish funds opened t-day at the final quo1ationsof Saturday, and ater exhibiting heaviness, in tonsequence o apprehensions of a Governmendefeat this evening, they ateadily rallied, and close i at an imnprbvement. Con5 so for money were first quoted 93 to j, whence they receded for a shor.
time to 93n to i. A belief then became ganeral tha'. there would be a Ministerial majority, and the las; trantiOns wrere at 93 to , the market exhibitin, an appearance of firmness, in which al departments of business participated. For the ne.r account in April tha closing price wa 94a Bank Stock left off at 219 to 221; Reduced, 94 to i; New Three per Cents., 94. tog; India Stock 219 to 222; Indla-bonas, 4s. discount to par; E(cbequer-bonds, 98i to j; and Exchequer.bills 2s. discount to 2s. premiuti.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was no particular pressure for money, but in the diasouatmarket and at the Bank the demand was very heavy at full rates. This is partly to be attributed to thi preparations for the 4th' of the month, the amoun; of bill falling due being always greater in Marc, than at any other period.
Business in foreign stocks has been more active,
and the principal feature is a rise of about 1X p8' cent. in TarkLih Six per Cents, the transactions for money having taken place at 97i, and for the account at 97, 90Q, 971, i, and 98. Iu the Four psr Cents. Guaranteed the bargains were at 10li. The other operations comprL ed-Brazman Fiva par Cents., New, 103; Peruvian, for money, 804- fothe account, 80 ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43; RuEsiaU Five per Cents., for the account, 107X; the Small, 98 ; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91 and 90; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 24; Spanish Certificates, 61, i, andi per cent.; Dutch iwo-and-aHalf per Cents., 65k and *; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 99 and 94k.
The corn-market this morning waw without r,covery.
The final prices this evening of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse were 70f. 40c. for money and 70f. 45c. for the account, showing a further improvement of a quarter per cent. The monthly liquidation has passed off well, and in the principal railwray s3hares there hias been great buoyancy. At Vienna, also0, there is a tendency to iucreased firmness.
The suspension has been announced to-day of Messrs. Swayne and Bovill, merchants, and patentees of various kinds of machinery. The amount of their liabilities is not ascertained, but it is believed to be large, probably over 100,0001. The nature of their assets is doubtful. According to some representations, they are fully equal to meet all claims, but a very different impression is generaly prevalent.
Messrs. Cheape and Ieslie, an old-established East India firm, have also stopped. The disaster in this case is understood to have been through some connexion with the transactions of Messrs. Swayne and Bovill, although the ordinary business of the two houses was entirely distinct. In this cmse, likewise, the estimate of liabilities and assets remains to be ascertained.
The commercial accounts from India by the overland mail to-day are all satisfactory. At Bombay there had been an active business in imported goods at advanced prices, while at Calcutta the market also exhibited an improved appearance, owing to a good demand from the interior. The more favourable tone hkewize of the rates of exchange, as reported on Wednesday by telegraph, is confirmed.
The letters from China gave a renewed impube to the tea-market this morning, and some rge operations were effected in common Congou at Is. Id. per lb.
The reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week describe no material alteration. At Manchester the market has been flat, owing to the tendency to a decline in cotton. Tne Birmingham Iron trade is well maintained, although there is scarcely so much activity as was expected at the beginning of the year. In the general occupations of the place steady employment prevails, and the foreign orders are, upon the whole, good. At Nottingham there has been an extensive business, beth in lace and hosiery. In the woollen districts the transactions have been on a satisfactory scale, and stocks continne low. The Irish linen-markets are fairly supported.
The mail steamer Clarendon, for the Cape of Good Hope and Calcutta, will take out 50,000!. in gold to the Cape for the Government service.
In the general business of the port of London durng the past week there has been increased antmty. The number of ahips reported inward was 144, including 12 with cargoes of sugar, 10 of corn, in addition to 11,000 barrels of flour, and 1 of tea, comprising 21,457 packages, the greater portion of which are chests. The number of vessels cleared outward was 131, including 14 in ballast. The total number of ships on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 59, being 8 less than at the last account. Of these 6 are for Adelaide, 3 for Geelong, 4 for Hobart Town, 2 for Launceston, 4 for Melbourne, 8 for New Zealand, 15 for Port Phillip, 1 for Portland Bay, 15 for Sydney, and 1 for Swan River.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the week have comprisd 7 vessels3 to Adelaide, 2 to Port'Phillip, to Sydney, and 1 to Hobart Town. The rates of freight have not experienced any recovery.

Epidemic Among Cattle.
EPIDXAMII AMONG CATTLE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Through your journml of tho 24th inst I drewr attenthon to tho progress of theo '"Ftal Epidemic Mturrain " on the continent, rts ravagos in Engiandintho middlo of the last centuy, and its probable re-introduction to your ountry by the import of cattle from lIolland, where it owV exists.
In repl to a question in Parliament two days after the ubhIcation of my letter I find the rice-Preident of the Board of Trade states that he on that day had been informed that a calf suffering from this diseaso, and found on board a Rotterdam vessel, had becn killed aund its body de. strojed, but that the remainder of the cattle were free from that disease. May I through you inquire whether those other cattle so said to be "free from the disease" have been sent back to Rotterdam or let looee through your cotntry? In the latter event possibly all precautions are at an end. That the remaining cattle should have esc ed infection from tho " destroyed calf," after herding 'vitis it during the passage is improbable; still moro improbable that the coftntagion sorceived during the yo age could have leveloped itself beforo their arrival, since eito le for so lorng as 14 days. e aetfrs
It is only, therefore, after a week or ten days more tha%t the Vice-Prcsident of the Board of Trade can be in a
tion to state that the " remainder of the cattle are free m disease." Should he doubt the Interval which the diseae takes to appear, or tho possibility, assIggested in myformer letter to you, of its being introduced " through raw idaes," even though pickl;ed, I am prepared to supply him, or any ether member ofthe Hoase of Commons, with my authorities on both subjects.
If thc disease has been unfortunately thus already intro. duced into Englnd,'will ot the authorities aid us ere yet too hto by adopting the simple, eQicient, and by DO ineas
inconvenient precautions sggestedin my former letter, or, sorne others, aginst its ingress into this poor countrylhich s1iaortseitseeZ and in a preat measure yours, by its .,cattle

JOHN PATTESON. ad .i9br JntHr T)nnqnv I
vr. ADDAacS, in replying in this case, said, that he understood that condemnation was asked for by the captors on two grounds-first, a broeoh of blockade; and, secondly, trading with the enemy. It was utterly impossible that condemnation could take place on the first ground, because the captors had not given the persons on board the vessel anopportnnity by examination in preparatory of explainittg sue circum6tances under which she went in and out of
te Danube. There was no excuse whatever for not proceeding to that examination. Lord Stowell laid it down as
e fist duty of a captor to proceed to adjudication * unless e di so, however meritorious his conduct might have een,. restituttion mast follow. (The "lieldab," 3 Sir C. Rob., 235.) With respect to trading with the enemy, he 'would reservs what he had to say on that stubject until he dealt with the Gerasimo.
1HE GERA}Mo-CLAD rFOBn RSTTITUTION OF CARGO.
This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Admiralty condemning the cargo on board the Gerasimo as good and lawful prize. This vessel, under Wallachian colours tok on hboard at Galatz a cargo of Indian corn, :With 'which she sied, hound for Trieste, and in the prosecution of such voyago was captured on the 19th of J-ily, 1854, comlng out of the Salina moath of the Danube, for a
.reach of blockade of that river, by Her Majesty's ship . esvius, and carried to Constantinople. The vessel was released upon security, and the cargo sold at Constantinople, aster survey, with the consent of the agent of the proprietors. On the 2d of lovember, 1855, the ship was con*.emaed, no claim having been made in respect of her. The
resehclaim for the cargo was made on the 21st of June, Er,donthe 23d of November following it was condemned.
Dr. ADDAMS, on bouealf of the appellant, said, that in this case the ship's papers had not been brought in, nor had any examination in preparatory been taken. A monition had been taken out on the part of the owner, calling apon the captors to proceed to adjudication, and he submitted that onx the autnority of the Huldah and other cases that ad. ntdtted but of one answer-the captors must comply with the monition, or restitttion with costs and damages must follow as a matter of course. The monition to proceed to adjudication could only be complied with by the depositions of thewitnesses in proparatory being brought in and the s-lbps papers being regularly verified. The " Speculation," (2 ir . Rob., 293), showed how the Court dealt with any
rgity in the examination bf witnesses. A similar course had been pursued by the American Courts. Captors were bound to send captured vessels to a convenient port for adjudication, but in this case the vessel was sent to Coustantinople where no prize commission was sitting. (The " Washtugton," 6 Sir C. Rob. 275; the " Madonna del Burso," 4 Sir C. llob., 169 ; and the " Peacock," 4 Sir C. Rab. 186.) Other vessels were sent to Malta, and so niight the (erasimohavebeen. The olaimantwas entitled to restitution with costs and damages unless he was an enemy alien, the principal point upon which the judgment turned. The claimant was a subject of the Ionian Islands, but was resident at Galatz. Galatz was in Moldavia,; moldavia at the time was in possession of the Russians, and the Cour below
Uen into the error of supposing that because there was mere hostile possession all the inhabitants carrying on trade were to be consideied asalien enemies. Before such a result could arise there must be surrender and capitulation. (The " Danckeboar Africaans" 1 Sir C. Rob., 107 ; and. the "Boedes Lust" 5, Sir C. Rob., 233). There were other casesbearing indirectly on the question. (Tbe " Fama,"5 Sir C. Rob., 106, and the " Manilla," Edwards' Ad., R. 1.) The proclamation issued by the Russians on crossing the Prathin 1853 showed that there was no pretence for saying that the claimant stood in the position of an alien enemy. Withregard to the alloged breach of blockade, he contended that there was no case of condemnation on that account, 'where there had not been a preparatory examination and the shp's papers had not been brought in. He submitted that the cargo ought to be restored, with costs and damages.
Dr. Twiss foUowed on the same side, and contendod, on various authorities, that the occupation of WaUachia and laloldavia by the Russian forces, under the circumstances in which it took place, could not divest the claimant of his national character. Further proof having been ordered by the Court below as to the ownership of the cargo and the non-examination of witnesses in preparatory, the evidence was necessarily confined to those points. The notica of the blockade of the Danube contained in the London Gazette, as commencing on the 13th of June, 1854, was extremely mea as compared with the usual notifications. The
of the river had been declared in a state of blockade, but he submitted that England had not power to issue such a declaration. The Danube was ose of those large rivers which was open to all European States as much as the sea.
The whole ofthe sea eould not be declared in a state of blockade; the blockade must be limited to specified ports,
c. Tbhe pinaciple was laid dowu in "the hagnus." (1 Sir

COURT OF CEINCERY. LI TT.nr'nrT AT.- ) LT THE MAXrM OF THE BEDFOllD ClAhlm-V
(Befor the T.ORTIR fTh"r". ,VA A -. -
I ms petition Ot appeal from an order of Vice-Chancellor Wood was opened on Saturday, and was continued to-day. The petition stated that the Bedford Charity was in March, 3849, regulated by the Bedford Charity Act, 7th of George 1V., by the second section of which it wtIs enacted that the trustees of the estates should be the lord-lieutenant of the county of Bedford, the members for the town, and the mayor, recorder, aldermen, common council, bailiffs of the same town, and the master and usher of the Grammar School, and 18 inhabitants of -tho town elected as thereins mentioned, and who were made a corporate body. In 1849 the trustees considered it necessary to raise 12,000L. on moztgage of the charity. estates, but it was considered that this could not be done by authority of Parliament. A Bill was, therefore, introduced into the House of Commons, and was there referred to a select committee. The trustees also applied to the Court of Chancery for leave to proceed with the Bill, and Vice-Chancellor Wigram, on the 29th of March, 1849, referred the matter to the Master. In the meantime the finances of the charity improved and the order of reference was abandoned by the trustees, but it was taken up by the Attorney-General contrary to their wishes. The Mtaser (Mr. Blunt,) reported in February, 1852, that the roles and constitution of the charity should be made, and especially that 24 trustees shoald be appointed by the Court of Chancery. In August in the same year Vice-ChanceUor Parker made an order appointing how the fature trustees should be elected, and Eent the matter back to the Master to settle a Bil in Parliazent to effect this and other proposed changes. In 1853 Vice Chancelor Wood mnade an order on the petition of the Attorney- General, giving him liberty to introduce the Bill intoParliament. he BBiUwasbroughtin, and wasopposed by the trustees, and ultimately was thrown out in a select committee. Another Bil was presented to Parliament in pursuance of an order of Vice-Chancellor Wood, dated November, 1854, butthis Bill didnot pass. In these matters2,126l. wasthe amount of thecosts ofthe Attorney-General Thepetition stated that the surplus rents and pruiAts of the charity were wholly inadequate to these costs, and therefore the trustefs prayed that the order of Vice Chancellor Wood, dated July, 1855, by which he ordered payment of these coets, might be discharged.
I MIr. Rolt and Mr. T. Stevens supported the appeal
31r. W. 3. James and Mr. Wickens appeared for the Attorney-GeneraL
During the argumeRt the respondents counsel read a variety of placards stuck up on the walls of the town of Bedford during the election of trustees of the charity, and also an election card in favour of the party who were opposed to the grasnmar sehool, on which appeared the word "'bevan," which, in an affidavit, was sworn to mean, in Bedford slang. "pay " and its purport was that the voter who held it and hadvoted'or a particularlistof trusteescou]d presentthecard at certain pubhchouses, and receive or be paid certain sums of money or enjoy other benefits. These placards and card vere ordered to be impounded with the registrar, as it might hereafter be necessary to found proceedinu onthem. In answer to a question from the Bench, {r. 41.aes said that the whole expenses incurred in this matter had reached a sum of not less than 5,0001.
Lord Justice KNiGsT BRuCz observed that the notion of 'scot and lot" voting for trustees of a charity, conducted, tco, s the counsel for the Attorney-General represented that they were, supposing his instructions to be correct, was, to say the least, disgraceful to civilization. He said it was impossible that a body of trustees elected as these trustees vere directed to be could do their duty. True it was thad in this country we had blessings and advantages that compensated even such proceedings as were here disclosed. In no other country in Europe could such an expenditure as 5,000!. on such a subject have been possible. In any othet country the whole would hbave been done for 50I.
Lord Justice TunExR added that abroad Such proceedh ings would not have been defaced by Political feefling.
Mr. SVEvzNs was heard at length inreply, contending that, as the order of 1849 was made on the petition of the trustees alone, the Attorney-General had no title to intervene, and that if he could, of his own caprice and whim n apply to Parliament for the alteration of the charity and its constitution, and thus spend, say 5,0001. a-year, there -would be no occasion for much trouble about the manae ment of the oharity, since in no long time there would ho no charity estates to administer.
Lord Justice KNrGEHT BRUCR said that the charity, the subject of the application before the Court, was regulated by an Act of ParliamentpKssed in 1826, more than two cen~ tories after its foundation. That Act contained provisions so ulainly objectionable that his Lordship was at a loss to con,jecture how it could have passed through both Houses of the Legislature. That Act being a private Act, he spoke of it with the less scruple. That Act long continued to regulate the affairs of this most nli,rtunate chari Such a state of things it vas impcble to contemplate without deep regret. Under the authoriy of the Court of Chancery efforts had been
intdand most properly made-to remedy these defects. It was the duty of this Court to,assist gich efforts, and, - oi~dingly the Court of Ohancery sanctioned the inLvoetion of Ihe aid of the Attorney-General, and allowed an. appliCation to be made to earliamerit for a bill, o-ntaining the! most wholesome, usefuL ,lnd11ost lust prQvisions for the government of the acpity. That bill pw-sed-the House,of
ords, but it was rejectd by the LowerHoase, rby th3 aeb of anelectcommittee of afle members of that hody.. That * beig st andtho part1ed.promoting the better iveiranfedt
of the charity believing that thero was no 4ope oÃ¯Â¿Â½A"y - other result, at least f* $he.aape tHouse of- Commons,
(tio rem,d.T such -gros3. evils,, the v ice-Chancellor ordered~ the costs of the Att nby-Genere.l which had been. thns in-
curred to be paid outoftfietharity funds, heoaisse, ashel (the Lord Justice) supposed, the costs could not be orderedX
to be pdd, in a safedminiAtrÃ¯Â¿Â½tionof jdsticj, by any other
Party or parties.. The qtLestion, it -the tneantime, was b+-' tween the funds of the charity and tbe public at large, and, as this Court had no power to order-the pubuc to pay, it had no alternative but to direct the coats to be paid out of the charity estate. the appealmnust be dismissed with cost, and his Lordship hoped thatthe Attorney General would be able to discover some way in which his costs of this appetl mght be ted upon some one, and not upon the chanity.
LrJustice TuxRx, in an elaborate 3udgment, stated the wvhole proceedings, and concluded by expressing his deep regret that he had no power to visit the wvhole costs upon
those who had prosecuted the appeal It was quite shocldng to see how this charity, and other charities in the coantry,
had been managed.
Lord JnBticO KNiGH RBucz.-Let me express a Lope that this great and noble chrity may hereafter be managed in a manner fzee from the scandal that has hitherto characterized its government. His Lordship then directed the registrar not to part with the placards and pay ticket, as the time might come when those documents might be of use.

J:bls caso was argued on the 12th of February, and his Honour then reserved his decision. Mr. French, the testator in the cause, was a chronometer maker,and entered into an
greement with a, person named Gibbons to dispose of his business upon certain terms and for certain considerations, one consideration being two annuities,-one vested in the testator and Gibbons dnring their joint lives, and after his decease, in case he should die before Gibbons, then during the joint lives of Gibbons and the testator's widow, Augusta French, the testator haYing power to transfer and release the annuity to her during his lifeinthe same manner as if it was payable ins prusenti, the xnnuity to be paid to the wvidow for her separate nse without power of anticipation. The annuity to the testator was to amount to one quarter of the profits of the business, and that to the widow to onesixth. French died in 1854 wiithout having exercised his power to release or transfer the annuity to his widow which was made the subject of settlement, and both suits were nstituted by creditors of Mr. French, and the question was raised whether, under the statute of Queen Elizabeth, a settlement of a reversionary annuity was not void as against creditors, inasmuch as at the time it was made French was indebted? Upon the case coming before Vice-Chancellor Stuart his Honour thought that the settlement was void, and therefore that there was no annuity * but the Lord Chancellor took a different view, and held that, although the settlement mlight be void for some purposes, yet that the annuity was subsisting, being part of the consideration for the assignment of the testator's business, and that the annuity was assets for the benefit of the testator's creditors, in the hands of his wife as executrix, and the question now was whether such assets were legal or equitable ?
Mr. Glasse, Mr. Terrell, Mr. Greene, and Mr. Dickenson appeared for the several parties.
The VICO-CHACELLOR now recapitulated the facts, and saidthat he adhered to theprinciZple which he had laid down in the case of " Cook v. Gregson' (1 Drew, 147), that the question whether the assets were legal or equitable was not dependent upon the question whether the testator's interest was legal or equitable, but whether a creditor could have sued in a court of lsw or equity, and whether, if an action had been brought against Augusta French, a court of law would have held that they came to her hands virntue officii
Ms Honour's opinion was that in thie case the assets came to Mrs. French's hands qud executrix, and were legal assets.
(Before ice-OChasncdor Sir Josnz STUART.)
CARTBR V. HASWELL.
This case was resumed and concluded. Hugh Carter, the testator in the cause, by will, dated in 1854, gave al his real estate to trustees upon trust for his sister, Sarah Carter, with a proviso and direction as to certain farms, which the testator devised in a manner which failed by reason of the gift being contra tolaw? The question was whether, the gift of the farms naving failed, the residuary devisee became entitled to them, or whether they devolved on the testator's co-heiresses-at-law. A question was also raised in the argument at the bar as to the right of the testator's widow to dower out of the farms; but it is unnecessary to report the case on that point, as the decision which the Court oame to put an end to all question as to any such right onD the part of the widow. Section 25 of the Wills Act (the 7th of William IV., and the Ist of Victoria, chap. 26) enacts "that, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will, such real estate or interest therein as shall be comprised, or intended to be comprised, in any devise in such wi contained, which shall fall or be void by reason of the de- h of the devisee in the lifetime ot the testator, or by reea*, of such devise being contrars to law or otherwise incapabl of taking effect, shall be included in the residuary devise (if any) contained in such wiU."
-Mr. A'PHLrr appeared for the plaintiff, who was the residuary devisee and one of the co-heireses at law of the testator; Mr. HL R. Young for the other co-heiress; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Hobhouse for the testator's widow; and MIr. EJlis and Mr. Baggallay for other parties.
The VICE.-CHL?ELLOR said that, looking at the true interpretation of section 25 of the Wills Act, it was imossible to say that there was not such a general gift of ll the testator's residuary real estate in trust for Sarah Carter as that the devise of the farms, which failed by reason of its being contrary to law, did not fall under the words of the residuary gift. Ifthe question had arisen merely on the terms of the git, it was plain that the farms would have passed. The language of the 25th section was peculiar. It said that unless a contrary intention shonld appear by the will, a residuary devise should include real estate comprised in a devise which was void. Now, although an exception of certain real estate out of a general residuary devise might appear to manifest an intention that the property so excepted should not go to the residuary devisee, it was plain from the language of the section that the circumstance of that property being given in a manner which failed by reason of the zift being contrary to law was not of itself such a mawfestation of intention on the part of the testator that the residuary devsee should not take it as the Legislature contemplated, for it expressly enacted that lands comprised n a void devse should go to the residuary devisee uness a contrary intention appeared. He was of opinion that the farine passed to the plaintiff under the general residuary devise.

The object of these suits was to obtain, under somewhat singular circumstances, the declaration of the -Court that the plaintiff, as the personal representative of one James Frank, who died in Jersey in\the month of February, 1855, was ex;titled to certain shares and stock in each of the above companies which the deceased had in the year 1847 pur. ported to transfer to one " James Trent." This latter per. sonage (it had been discovered) was a myth and a fiction, the name having been used and the transfers executed by the deceased with a view, it was supposed, of protecting the shares from the grasp of creditors who were at that time mainmg demands against him. By the evidence adduced it was satisfactorily established that, although the execution by "James Trent" of the transfers in question appeared upon the face of them to be duly attested, such in fact was not the case, the attesting witness having signed his name merely to oblige the deceased. It appeared, moreover, that the deceased, notwithstanding the transfers, had in fact received the dividends from time to time, and the ewidence of parties acquainted with his handwriting left no doubt of the signature "James Trent," both to the transfers and the dividend warrants, having been written by the deceased. Under these circumstances, and the non-existence of James Trent being satisfactorily proved, the Court made a ,declaration of the plaintif's title to the stock and shares in question in the following terms: -Declare that the deceased James Frank used the name of James Trentas another designation of himself, and that the pbuntiff, as the administrator of James Frank, is entitled to transfer the stock and. shares in question and to receive the dividends.
Mr. Rolt and Mr. Rodwell were for the plaintiff, and Mr. Willcock and Mr. Speed for the companies.
In the course of this case,
The VICE-CEANCELLOR took occasion to remark on the inconvenient mode adopted by commissioners of marklng, or rather not marking, exhibits. Instead of the exhibit itself being marked, it was frequently attached byasnr wafer to another piece of paper referring toi, soas mer
render the identity of the thing exhibited far from conclusive or satisfactory.

Mr..- CBrnveY, for the bankrupt, submritted thathi
failure was principally attributable to his having been,able to getmoney too easily. 3r. Baxter, his godfather, had notonly.known him, but assisted him from infancy. The figures were,much the.same at the bankruptcy s on t,he ,1st of Jan,4ary, 1855 when thero -was a surplus of 3,387&.

Hi ' l oSroui held that if there was 'one Class of tra'le more detrimental than another, it was that of ataioi, *ho
accommodated young men with money and tempted tem;
with credit to any extent forUclothes. They were tempted to their ruin and driven, abroad. Young men came from the Crimea expecting to be welcomed by their friends, only to find themselves pursued by a, sheriWfs officer. Tihe tadeo which the banPkrupt bad followed was now A common one, particularly at the West-end. Parties who faled must expect when they came before a com-mercial court to be called to account for incuiring great risks in lending rnoney to extravagant young men- Credit was
taken for tho bankrupt's conduct since his bankruptcy, which it was alleged had been beneficial to his creditors in enabling them to recover debts. Since the bankraptcy, it was claimed for him, he had pursued these wretched young men in every way, and he wasentitled to credit for his exertionseon behn-f of the estate. The whole amount, however, that had accrued from book debts amounting to between 11,0001. and 12,0001., had only been 2,80Q., and the odd 20.01., making the amount 3,00QI., was all that could be fairle.xpectedfrom the future on account of the debts wlich theseyouthahad contracted.Someofthem had changed their country, and others, perhap hadochanged theirnames. He must dissent from nir. Chidley's view of the case, that the baukruut's conduct bad not been recl-ess. Was it not reckless for tho bankrupt to go, as he had gone, to almost every regiment in the service and accommodate the young officers with clothes 9 The trade that he had pursued was one that carried much misery into families. Young men were thereby led into extravagance at an age when they scarcely knewr what they were doing. It was a trade greatly to be deprecated, and the bankrupt wvould only receive a tkhird-class certificate after 12 months' suspension fromt that day, wth protection from three months to three months.
IN RE J. B. L
The bankrupt was a glass and china dealer in Blackfriarsroad.
Mr. B,AGLrY said a proof of 2501. was tendered on behalf of the assignees of the Royal British Bank-, as arising from a call of 501. per share upon Sve shazes in the bank. The onl1 question was the validity of that call, and, as doubt hDao been thrown upon it, it was desirable to have the opinion of the Court.
* The CoisgssioNRe said, as such a doubt ,was sugested, would there be any objection to the debtbeing eniered upon the proceedings as a claim orly ?
Mr. laNmIATEn said that, ramours from time to time having been circulated that the assignees could not recover the amount of the call, it having been made by the directors after the bank had stopped payment, he must press for the decision of the Court. Mr. CoNmmissioner Fonblnque, ona. similarcasoe, had decided that there was no valid objection to the proof. Cases occurred every day in which the assignees of traders were allowed to adopt ats commritted after an act of bankruptcy. The law was clear upon the point, and, as the question was one of considerable importance, he hoped to have the decidon of the Court.
His Ho'roun said he could not act upon a mere suggestion that the claim was Invalidi He must act upon evidence, and, the evidence in its support being satisfactory, the proof must be admnitted.
Admitted accordinglya.
Mr. Pennell, official assignee, stated that the debts were only 3161., and that the bankrupt valued the assets at l,21151. There w as, no doubt;, a considerable surplus. The failure might thus be;said to have arisen entirely from the bankrupt's counuexion with the Royal British Bank.

This was an action to recover damages for injurfes that were alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of
the servant of the defendant.
Mr. Edwin James, QC and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. 'I. Chambers, be., was for the defendant,
It appeared that the defendant was an undertaker in Betbnal-green, and that he had been engaged to conduct the funeral of aMr. Writer, the landlord of the Sevezi Stars publichouse, Bthnalgreen, by his widow. The plain. tiffs were related to Mlr Writer, and at her request they accompanied the deceased tothegrave; and on their return it appeased that the carriage on which they and five other mourners were seated was overturned, and the plaintiff's wife received very severe injuries upon her head and hands, and it was to recover compensation for these Injuries that the present action was brought against the defendant, it being alleged that the accident was occasioned by the negligent manner in which his servant drove the coach containing the mourners. The case on the part of tho defendant was that the man who drove the mournirg coach was not the servant of the defendant, but that he was engaged at the request of Mrs. Writer, who wished to get him a job, and it was also contended that there had been no negligence on his part in driving, and that the accident was occasioned by a waggon driving against the mourning coach, and compelling him to back his horse to get out of the way, and that in so doing the hid wheels got upon the pavement, and owing to there being so large a number of persons iuside the coach was overset. The man who drove the coachupon the occ:.- sion was called as a witness and he stated that the accident was entirely occasioned by s ht satdotha the andente to out upon him as he was passing under a f ilway arch, and he also proved that prs.

CEZiTTRAL aOMMIrAL COURT Marc& 2.
The March session of the above Court was opened this morning by the Right Hon. T. Q. Finnis, Lord Mayor; Russell Gurney, Esq., Q.C., Recorder of theCity of London; Aldermen Sir B. W. Carden Wire, and Hale ; W. Sheriff hiechi, 3Mr. Sheriff Keats, Ulr. Under-Sheriff Orosley, Mfr. Under-SheriffAnderton, &c.
It appears by the first edition of the calendar that there are only 89 prisoners for trial at the present sesson.
The REconDER, in his charge to the grand jury, said he was happy to be able to congratulate them upon there being very fewprisoners for trial, and thatthere vereconsenenly very few cases to be brought before them, and very tew of those cases were of a character that rendered it necessary for bin to make any observations respecting them. He was happy to see that there vas only one case involving the destretion of human life, and this was - a charge of manslaughter arising out of a drunken brawl, during which a blow was strack which caused the deceased Tnah to fall, and his head strack the ground, and it was alleged that the injury he so received upon the head was the cause of death. The only question they would have to consider in this case was whether the prisoner was proved to have struck the blow that caused. the deceased to fall, and if that fact was made out to th6ir satisfaction it-would be their duty to finda bill. There was a charge against another prisoner of having wilfully set fire to a hous, some persons being therein at the time, and this was one of those offences that according to the present state of the law, was still capital.' The evidlence would apeap to make out distinctly that thepior dstfre to a room t'hat he occupied,- and if thgan rysol be of opinon thalt this was establisthe an htesnwere in th ohoiseat the time the et wa tedth uldb bound toftind true bil agains th rsnr h only other case to which he cniee tncsayt direct their attention was one of consdrbepbi motne but which was not likely to presn n iiute ote

Befor dismisiung the grand. jary the R;corder ad. vnsed them not to throwout any bill without examini the whole of the witnesses whose names were oi the back of the bill, as, he said there was reason to believe that at a former session.pomebillshadbe bLigoed which would not have been theeae if the grand jury had been aware of all the facts connected with those cases
Tihe grand jury then retired, and the Court proceeded to disose of the bsidneasof the sesi-on.
Henry Parish, a personL of gentlemanly appearance, Surrendered to take his trial upon two charges of forgery and perjuzy.
In this case it appeared that there had been buainess transactions between the defendant and the prosecutor, and that legal proceedings were pendingbetween them, andthere appred to be no doubt that in order to prevent the defendant froma giving evidence at a trial that was about to take pl7ace0 the prosocutor went before the grand jury at this court behind the back of the defendant and obtained the -two hiUs that were now before the Court, never intending, however, to proceed with the charges. Notice had been left at the address givenby the prosecutor of the intention of the
lefendant to appear and take his trial, but he had left, and no one was now in attendance toxupporteitherof the indict3nents, and the prosecutor could not be found.
Mr. RoBnnsoN stated some of the facts connected with ,be proceedings to the Court, and said that the defendant .was a gentleman of great respoctability, and there was not the slightest pretence for the cbagwes that had been made againshim. The erosecutor had bronght an action against '-e defendant, and just before it was to bo tried he obtainedthese billssolely with the object to prevent Mr. Parish, from be'eaie.H however, became acquainted with th oth bis havng been found, and put in bail, and the prosecutor, finding that his object had thus beenfrustrated, withdrew from theaction. The defendant had done al he could to give notice to the rrosecatonof his intentiontoappsarandeake his trial, but he could not befound, and he aidhe hoped ehat under these circnstances no discredit whatever would attach to the character of Mr. Parish in referenoe to this transaction.
The RxconnDnE said it was a very great hardship for a charge to be preferred behind the back of another, in the way thes charges appeared to have been, and it would be Tery cruel indeed if the defendant in the present instance suffered in any way in his credit from these charges having been rnadeagainit him; indeed, as the prosecutor-did not appear to support them, the reasonable inference was that there wisno foundation for those charges.
The jury then returned a verdict of Not Ã¯Â¿Â½RGuy, and the defendant left the court.
William Missenden surrendered to take his trial upon an indictment charing him with stealing a bull and a heifer, t eprerty of John Gibson.
.Robinsonprosecated, and Mr. Ribton defended.
it wllU be recolected that at the last sessdon of the Court the prisoner and another man, named Tomidns, were tried for the same offence, and the case, then reported very fully, was proved to be this :-The prisoner is a cattle-dealer, and Tom nnswashisdrover. In Novemberlast the prosecutor sent some cattle up to the Harrow 3tation, and from the drove the cattle in question were missed. The prisoner about that time took a field near Hampton Court, where he brought a quantity of cattle which he was abont offe -
for sale at Kingson fair. To this place prosecutoes bus
and heifer were brought, but it did not appear that the
renor knew that they were not part of his own drove. how bull, it su aftenwards discovered, had been sold by Tomkins to a butcher, in Smithfield, where it was killed.

MAxSIO-Housz.-The LoRD MA-Top, upon taking the chair in the Justice-room, said he was happy to find that the attention of the Poor law Board had been directed to the condition of the casual ward of the W.ect London Union at Battle-bridge, and that steps were about to be taken for making better accommodation for the reception of the casua, paupers. He had expressly stated on a former occasion that the men and women were not huddled together, but were kept in distinct compartments of that institution, and he thought it necessary to make that statement, in order to remove an impression which seemed to have somehow gained currency that he had used an observation to which he bad never given utterance.. He was confirmed in the opinion he had previously exprecsed of the deplorable want of accommodation in the building to which he alluded by his friend Mfr-Moore, of the firm of Copestake and Moore, of Bow Churchyard, well known for extensivo philanthropy, who, upon areccut visit to the place, was shocked to fina that human beings were subjected to such degradation. His Lordship then said that he would take the ihbrty to sugggest that, as there were several unoccupied buildings in tne vicinity of the old Smithfield-market, wlhich could be adantageously appropriated to the purposes of the West LondonUnion, the guardians could not do better than make a selection from that neighbourhood for the socommodation of the numerous claimants whom necessity had driven into inevitable dependence. He hoped that the matterwould not rest, and he declared that it was his determined intention to call upon the Commissioners of the Poor Law Board for the purpose of submitting to them the urgent necessity which existed for energetic action upon the occa-

Oxford-street. Witness told him there was no r. Smith there, inor any Oxford-street in that nei bourhood, and explained to himi that the only streets of that name he knew were at the West-end and Stepney. The prisoner apologized for the trouble he had given, and wished them to rirnk at his expense. Witness refused, but ,risoner persisted, fetcbed some gin, and, with great persuasion, or "force," as the German expressea it, ie, his wife, and *nother woman were induced to take a mall quantity of it. He and his wife then left for Whitechapel, the prsoner saying he would go with them, ana he
did so, tat last the prosecutor found his company a nuisance, wanted to get rid of him, and told him bluntly, "I want no more of your society; you had better go."

Staples had acted most kindly and liberaly towards all their servants, and could not defend the conduct of the prisoners in taking their roperty; but he hoped that both the prosecators and his Worship would deal leniently with the prisoners, who had up to the present borne a good character, and treat their offenoe summarily for the unlawful possession.
Mr. NomRO2 oberved thAt the offence was ono of a character against which no aumount of capital could stand. It was not his (Mr. Norton's) wish to give the Messr. Staples more trouble than necessary, and he should thefore remand the prisoners to a future day to gire time to inqure about their character, and on the account he received of them would depond in a great measure the mode in which he *hould ultimately dispose of the case.
The prisoners were then remanded.

" It is my painful duty to state the accidental upsetting eand sinking in deep water of one of our cutters on the 20th of October, 18S6, while returning from the island Wakaya, adjacent to 010au, in the Fejees, while uinder a press of sail, with an overload of cocoa-nuts, through which the officers in charge, Mr. A. iRL Nugent, midshipman, aged 20, and five seamen, lost their lives, while so free from turbulence was the channel between the island and ship that two of the crew swam back to the shore, a distance of two nmiles in the wind's eye, and another gained the ship 'With the sad intelligence.
"All the united efforts of the small craft of Ovolau, and the ship's boats failed in even recovering the bodies of our lamented shipmates.

The extensions and improvement of the dockyard at Pembroke are this year to be carried out to the extent of 120,0001. The widening of the entrance dock is to cost Z,000f., and the lengthening and widening of the dock whicb has been so long in hand is to cost 20,0001. this year. The two new slips and the boat basin extending along the wharf are also to be vigorously carried on, and these, with Zprovision for scouring away the mud between the Carr Spit and the dockyard bank in front of the dockyard, wil cost 30,0001. It is proposed to improve the navigation in front ef the yard, and to deepen and widen very materiaUy the channel. This wiU be done by removing large quantities of mud which have been for years accumulating. The roof over slip No. 12 is to be extended seaward, and altogether 4the sum appropriated for this will be 10,0001. The erection of larger sawmills, engine-house, workshops, a new foundry, and plambers' shops is to cost upwards of 20,0001. The aawnils are advancing towards completion, and the sheds over Nos. 1 and 2 are being extended seaward. 'The foundry is to be erected on the site of the old iron store. The new slips are being constructed in the best manner. The bed is of limestone and the copings of granite, and the whole is being laid down most satitsfactorily. The work of each contTactor is performed under the superintendence of an inspector, who sees that it is done in a proper xaanner.

A NEW COMET.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Pernit me to inf,rm your astronomical readers of the discovery of a telescopic comet by Professor D'Arrest, of Leipic, on the 22d of February. The professor gives the following position as approximate :-February 22d, at 16 hours 40 inii., Leipsic mean tin*, comet's right ascenFion 21 hours 22 min. 28 secs.; hioi declination, 22 de. 4 min. I succeeded in recognizing the comet from this observatory late on the night of Saturday, and obtained as its position on February tho28th, at 17 hours 23 min. 32 secs. Greenwich mean time, comet's right ascension, 21 hours 43 min. 29-36 secs.; north declination, 26 deg. 54 min. 42 secs. The comet was similar to the brighter small mebule, but was much oppressed by fog and morning twilight at the time I observed it. The foregoing places Will enable any of your late-watching or early-rising readers to detect it withont difficulty.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

MURDER AT LANCASTER.-Much excitement
MIuRDEr A,T LAxcASTER.-Much excitement has prevailed during the past week in the usuaUy quiet town of Lancaster in consequence of the discovery on Sunday morning, the 22d -alt., of the body of a nman named John Cragg in an unused stone quarry, about half a mile from the town. The deceased was a warehouse-nan in the employ of Messrs. Charnley and Co., ironmongers, and was seen alive by different persons in several -parts of the town shortly after the midnight of Saturday, being at tIle time a little " the worse for drink." He was traced in the direction of his own home, in a bamlet about a mile east of the town, called "Golgotha," and was seen in the company of two men up to a certain distance in his homeward road. Cragg's body, when found accidentally by an old man who lives at a smnal house in the so-callcd "Scotch" quarry, was lying at the case of an escarpment 68 feet high, protected above by a six-feet wall of loose rubble stone. His pockets had not been rifled and the only suppositions which remained to account forhis unhappy death were either suicid, the having mistaken his pathisome, or foul play. A posst mnortem examination, undertaken by Mr. Hare, surgeon, discovered that the liver
ws doubly ruptured; the heart ruptured at the apex of the right ventricle, and an external wxound orn the left temple, corresponding with an internal depression of the bone beneath. The brain and abdominal viscera were perfectly healthy, but a fracture of the skllU, extending from the wound on the temple across the base of the temporal bone, nearly separated it into two parts. The indefatigable exertions of Mr. Wright, the borough superintendent of police, led, in the course of Sunday, to the apprehension of the two men who had been last seen with the deceased. Much evidence of an inculpatory character was adduced before Mr. R. Hinde, the Mayor, and a bench of borough magistrates at three examinations held on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. The character and extent of the evidence may be gathered from a brief summary. Tho two men were heard quarreUing with Cragg, and one of them speaking to him in a threatening manner on his way home. A prostitute deposed that she overheard
at night the other prisoner vowing vengeance against sonie one whose name abe could not catch. The two priEOners were found by a labourer in a barn on a farm caUed Mighileld, abouthalf-a-milefrom the quarry, early nextmorniag, and one of them began a conversation about Cragg, with whom he said he had had a ouarrel the night before. Added to this, the other prisoner had been repeatedly known to -express animosity towards the unfortunate rman for the share be had hadin his apprehension and conviction for burglary in 1852. The discovery of the poor mau's cap a few hun&ea yards from the plac where his body was found, marks therd of a heavy aubitanco being dragged across the footpath, the deceased's clothes being covered with mrud, a breach in
pro cting wall of the quarry larger and differing in the :positpontantd character of the marks on it and of the thrown off atones fromn those which could have been made by one muan, sounds of contention hxeard by three or four inmates of the wvorkhouse hard by about, the time when Cragg was last seen, and when he would be two-thirds of the dstance
towards hsown home, and a great amount of minor colJateral evidence, all seemned. to fix grave suspicion on the V.xisonerig, while the' IdcAlIty of the quarry precluded the

FOREST OF DEAN CENTRA_L
The first general meeting of thin opn a eda Glocester on Saturday. p was hdd at
The reiort congratulated the shareholders on the preeent position and future proepects of the undertaking. The Act wvas obtained last session, and since that timie the line had been marked out. The contract for the railway bad been let for 47,5001 to contractors who would at once commence operations, and it was intended that the line should be completed up to Moseley-green by the end of the year; a communication would thus be established with the Howbeach and other collieries, which it was believed would by that time be ready to supply a large quantity of coal to the railway. Other colhernes were also in a forward state. The officers of the Crown having power to grant to the proprietors of mine works a license to construct branch railways over the surfaco of the Dean Forest, it was expected the line would thereby receive many feeders from the msrounding districts. The railway would pass through extensive quarries of stone of the first quality. The district was also rich in beds of clay and shale suitable for making bricks and rough hardware. The money deposited in the Court of Chancery had returned a profit of 286&. The Commissioners of Woods and Forests had induced the Treasury to loan 20,v001., to be advanced as the works progressed. About 4,00)0 shares had been allotted, representing about 40,000^.
which, together with the loan from Government, would be qu^ite suffcient to construct the road,
The report was adopted, and the meeting separated.
EAST SUFFOLK.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Halesworth; the Earl of Stradbroke in the chair.
The report stated that provisional agreements bad been executed by Sir Morton Peto for laing down double lines of rails where the tranfic was likely to require that outlay, and for a lease of the hne and its branches for the extended term of 21 years at 6 per cent. per annum interest on the anmount of capital advanced by the shareholders, free from any deduction for the expenses of management, and for the deposit of satisfactory securities of the value of 100,0001. for the due payment thereof. During the last five months great ,rogress had been made in the construction of the line. The
lbury, hMaidon, and Colchester Railway Bill had already passed standing orders, and there was a fair prospect of its obtaining the sanction of both Houses of Parliament. The directors anticipated that this line would contribute largely to the development and prosperity of the traffic on the East Suffolk.
The accounts showed a balance in hand on the 31st of December of 2,0601.
The C}IA.MmA, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the line could be completed by next August, but if the Eastern Counties Company were unable to complete the Woodbridge and Ipewich line by the same time it would be of no very great use to open the East Suffolk alone,and it was therefore proposed to prolong the time for the execution the works. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ te xeuto
Mr. GAlmiTx, a director, expressed his entire satisfaction at the progress of the works.
The report and accounts were adopted unanimously, and the directors were authorized to exercise the borrowing powers of the company to the extent of 100,0001,
Sir i PETO saiWd with reference to the line from Woodbridge to I swich, he had felt it his duty to see Mr. Cobbold, who ^ad given his assurance that every difficulty had been removed, and that the line would be completed by the 1st of March, 1858. From that date screw steamers would be put on from Norwich, and every other portion of the navigation in communication with Yarmouth, so that goods could be taken upat Norwich and transmitted to London in aday. Similar arrangementS would be made at the other end ef the lines, if any dificulty was experienced with the Eastern Counies Company at the junction at Woodbridge.
The proceedings terminated with votes of thanks to Sir hL Pete and the directors.
WAVENEY VALLEY.
The report of the directors of this company, adopted at the meeting of proprietors on Friday, stated that the line from Tivetsaaltollarleston was worked by the Eastera Counties Company, but the directors regretted that the trafficarrangements had not be'n so satisfactory as they might have been either as regarded passeDgers or goods. By the discontinuance of market tickets a considerable loss had been sustained by the company. The directors had remonstrated against the policy adopted by the Eastern Counties directors. In January last an important meeting was held at Bungay, and strong opinions were elicited in favour of extending the line from Harleston to Beccles, and of working it in connexion with the lines of the East Suffolk Company. Sir S. Adair had subscribed 1,0001. towards the cost of the proposed line, and a committee was appointed for obtaining the local subscriptions necessary for proceeding with the extension. The traffie conveyed over the line to the end of June last was stated by the Eastern Counties Company to amountto 9421., from which they deducted 75 percent. for working expenses, leaving 2351. to the credit ofthe company, which they had not yet received. The traffic obtained for the Eastern Counties Company by the construction of the line was not included in the return, but the directors thought it muSt amount to several thousands annually. The directors had net yet obtained from the Eastern Counties Company any statement with regard to the trafflc for the past six months. The capital account shoved that 42,101l. had been received and 44,6651. expended, leaving a balance of 2,604l againSt the company.
HEREFORD, ROSS, AND GLOCESTER.
Tho half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Hereford, Colonel Vaughan in the chair.
The report explaed that the debt of 11,0171. to the bankers on the 31st of December last was only temporary. The directors had been called upon to pay 4,0001. for the joint station at Hereford, and this had been met by overdrawing the bankers, The traffic returns showed that 12,583. had been received during the half-year against 10,6341. at the corresponding period of 1865, showing an increase of 2,2191,, or 20 per cent. The apportionment of the half-year's revenue, after deducting debenture interest as a first payment, gives 60 per cent (6,6801) to the Great Western Company, and 40 per cent. (4,3871.) to this corapany, so that, after paying the guaranteed dividend, and setting aside 7801 to meet interest due on the 1st of April upon the bonds given to the contractors, there would remain a halance of 2,0201, equivalent to a dividend upon the ordinary share capital of the company of nearly 2 per cent. per annum, were it not that the balance was aleady pledged to the bankers. The total receipts and expenses on capital account amaounted to 399,9611.
The CHmRmwNa explained that the position of the company was entirely attributable to the expenses connected with the purchase of land and the engineering works having so much exceeded the original calculation.
The report was ther adopted, and the dividend on the preference shares at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum was
edecared.
The retiring directors and auditors were re-elected.
After some obeervations on the postal requirements of Hereford the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors.
SUNDERLA^1D DOCa.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Sunderland on 'Ihursday, Mr. C. Bramwell in the chair.
The report stated that the income for the half-year bad reached the sum of 18,5021., being an increase of4, 4331. over that of the corresponding period of last year, and tbat the balance at the disposal of the shareholders (after payin all the working expenses and the interest on the borrowed capital, except the interest upon 30,3631. for works now in progress) amounted to 8,2411., out of which the directors recommended a dividend at the rate of 41. per cent. per annum on the 121. 10s. preference shares; of 5l. per cent. per annum on the 6Z. Is. preference shares; and of 3Z. per cent. per annum on the 251. original shares ; which would amount to 8,0421., leaving a balance of 1981. to be carried forward. The graving dockhad been completed and opened for business
The CiLuRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said that the sea outlet had been tested during the winter by the most severe gales ever experienced on the coast, and had notsustained the least damage. Interest and dividend upon 600,0001. was now charged to revenue.
The report was a"reed to andthe dividendsrecommended in the report were aeclared. The meeting then separated.
NORTH YOREKSHRE AND CLEVELAND.
The half-yearly meetinl of this comnan ywas held at York on Friday; Lo-rd Deise and Dudley -in the chair.

There will be three stations upon this section of the line -viz., Potto, 8exhow, and Stokesley, at each of which there had been erected a dwelling-house for the stationmaster, waiting rooms, and coal dep,3ts. The directors bad made temnporary arrangemenits with the North-Eastern and West Hartlepool Railway Companies for the supply of locomotive power and working stock.
The CHs~A1r uxMovedI the adoption of the report, and stated that the Whorlton mineral branch would be openedl On the followin Monday, froma which a large amount of

A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings.
FLEETWOOD, PRESTON, AND WEST RIDING
JUNCTION.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Preston on Saturday; Mr. T. B. Addison in the chair.
The report stated that the Preston and Longridge Railway bad been lately purchased by the company- that the net revenue from the working of the two lines lor six months would suffice to meet the interest on the purchase of the Longridge Railway, including interest on loauf, leaving a small balance. The directors expected that an increoe of traffic from coal, &c., would shortly take p lseb, and that during the next half-year a larger -surplus woild aruise towards paying a dividend.

The h~VALE OF NEATH.
Thebal-yerlymeeingofthir company was held at Neath on Friday, Visount Vilers, ILP., in the chair.
The report staed that the trafric forthe balf-year endi
the 31st of December amounted to 39,0891., against 30,9174 at the corresponding period of 1855, showing an increase of 26-43 per cent. The merease in the ossengers ca*ried was 10-72 per cent., in the merchandise -30 per cent., and in the coal and coke 27-45 per cent. The directors proposed that the wholoof theinterest on loans sbould now andereafter be a charge against revenue. Adopting this course, they recommend a dividend at the rate of 4.p cent. per annum, subject to income-tax payable on the 2h of March, leaving a balance of 1,0001.
An abstract of the accounts appeared in 27 T1ri of SaLturday.
The On isAl , in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the ehareholders on the satisfactory poition of their afFairs. Since their last balf-yearly meeting twoimportant branches of communication had been opened-Tiz, the Aberdare Valley and the branch connecting the Dowlais Company's works with the Merthyr terminus, which would be productive of the greatest advantage to the trafic. The great difflculty which this company experienced ws in providing shipping places for the discharge of the traffic. He thought, however, that by means of the Briton-ferry Docks, the Swansea Docks aceommodation, and that which was being provided at Milford they would be able to develoe the traffc. He thought they might expect a larger dividend at the next meetinf.
Mr. BROUGHTON said their sstem o management had produced a most unfavourable impression upon the Stock-
xchange. He complained of the meeting. being held so late. The dividend ought to have been in the pockets of the shareholders some time, whereas they would not get it until Lady-day. Unless some alteration was made, a most unmistakeable demonstration would he made at the next half-yearly raeeting.
The SECRKTrY explained that the Vale of NTeath meetng must of necessity follow the Great Western and Son'h wales meetings;thattheaccountscouldnot be made up earlier unless extra expense was incurrcd.
After a short discusswon the report was adopted, and the usual resolutions, declaring the dividend, &c., were passed.
WHITEHAVEN AND FURNESS JUNCTION.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Whitehaven on Satutday; the Earl of Lonsdale in the chair.
Mr. H. CooK, the secretary, having read the notice convening the meeting, the report, an abstract of which has appeared in The VTmes, was taken as read.
The CAsUsMAN con tated the shareholdersoon their improved prospects. ethe Furness Company had entered into an eng-gement with the Ulverston and Lancaster Company, which, if carried into effect, would insure the openmng of the through communication between Whitehaven and Lancashire at an early date. They had undertaken to lend to the directors of the Ulvirston and Lancaster ine tho sum of 50,000L, under an engagement that the works on that line should be completed during next summer. On reference to the report they would find that, while their revenue had increased 25 per cent., their expenses had been diminished to the extent of 4001. or 5001. They were now in a position to pay a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. on the preference shares which had been issued. They expected considerable improvement in the traffic from the Uleator line, and there was no doubt that at their next meeting they would be in a position to pay a dividend on the wholo of the preference shares. They had, therefore, concluded to issuethe remainder of the preference sha in order to pay off some claims against the company. Had it not been for himself and a gentleman whom they all knew, the late Mr. Alderman Thompson, having advanced conslderable sams of money on their own personal securityn, and which sums were still unpaid, the comupany would have come under the Wirding-up Act. (Laughter.) He coneluded by moving the adoption of the report and statement of accounts.
Mr. J. B. WI5so0 seconded the motion, which was carried.
On the motion of Mr. CowVER, a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum was declared on the prefererceshares, and the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
CORK AND YOUGHAL.
The half-ye rly meeting of this company was held yesterday at Fen%all's Hotel, ralace-yard; Mr. Isaac Butt, LP., in the chair.
The report stated that the progress of the works had been steady, hut slow. Since the last halftyearly meetng a call of 21. per share had been made, the yrareas on which the directors hoped wvould be paid as soon asps sible, to enable them to complete the line from Middleton to Dunkettle.
The C kL!N, in moving the adoption of the repot remarked that in the present state of the money-market the directors felt it was not expedient to incur a larger e nditure for the purpose of pushing on the works. They h,by the exercie of economy, already nearly completed 10 miles of their line, so that a comparatively smaU additional outlay would make it ready for traffic. The cost of the works, so far as they had gone, had been below the original estimate, and the contractors had told him that an outlay of about'5,0001. per mile would put the line between Muddleton and DunÃ¯Â¿Â½kettle into a condstion to receive the rails When their line, together with the Queenstown branch, was completed, it would be one of the most remunerative undertakings in the kingdom.
The report was adopted, the outgoing directors and auditors were re-elected, and the proceedings terminated in the usual manner.
NEWRY, WARRENPOINT, AND ROSTBEVOR.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Liverpool on Saturday; Mx. F. Shand in the chair.
The report stated that a balance of 6531. remained at the credit of revenue, after payment of the dividend on the preference shares. Although the passenger traffic had remained nearly stationary, the tonnage of goods carried during the half-year had increased 30 per cent. An agreemaent had be~:n made with the Newry and Enniskillenx Comipany to lease the Warrenpoint line for a term of years, at a satisfactoryrental, andwhich the directors felt assured would prove mutually beneficial to both companies. Of the 6 per cent. preference shares 2,136 had been taken up since the 1st o January, auid 402 still remained on hand. The capital account showed that 121,1241. had been expended, leaving 10,2631 due to the banker, 6.541. to revenite, and 3041. to the secretary. The revenue account showed that 2,7851. had been received, and 1,2911. expended on working, 7011. interest on debentnres, and 1391. interest on preferenoe shares, leaving a balance of 6541.
The CHAIRiMNA observed that, after a good deal of negotistion, they had arrived at such terms with the Newrv aud Enniskillen Company as they thought would be satisfactory. If the junction line wore approved by the Boa d of Trade the Newry and Warrenpoint Company would have a free course i that direction. If not, they would have to contest it with the Navigation Company. Iuconclusion, he moved the adoption of the report, which was seconded by Mr. C. HoLLA2tD, and adopted,
Mr. C. Holland and Mr. Joseph Lupton were xe-elected directors, and Mr. J. Byrn was elected auditor.
The sum of 1201. was placed at the disposl of the directors as remueration for their servces during the current

"That very likely I should be wrong for not making him work with lmps." He said if anything were to happen he should make a bother. I replied, " As yon sy so, I will make sou work with lamps." He said, "You von't, I will leave the place first-"' and besddes he said, ' What occasion is there to work vit lamps?' Lodge said the brattices were a long way off I said we had gone considerably further very often without brattices in levels and slits, and I had never seenanygas The bratticawere from 20 to 30ardsfrom the face, as near as I can judge Accordin to rle 23, they ought not to have been more than 12 feet from the facing I never sawoocesion for having brattices at all in the slits or levels, so far as regards any danger from rgas. The coal does make much gas on the end, nor ever has done. In the boards we keep up to rule 23. We have driven levels and slits for more than 40 yards without any brattice. I believe it is customary ia all the pits in the district not to brattice the slits and levels according to rule 23.
By fr. Morton-It was in the top levei, on the north side, where I was taLking with Lodge. There was no other person present except Lodge's hurner. Lodge was work;ing with candle.
What is the greatest distance you have ever driven without brattises ?-In slits, 42 or 43 yards; in lodge's place they were from 20 to 30 yards from the face of the level On that day we had no working place in the pit where the bratties were further fros the facings, nor any so far as in Lodge's I had seen all the worling places in the pit on the dey prior to the exploSon.
Has any other person besides Lodge ever said anything to ou about the brattices being so far behind s1-Tever, plenty ave grumbled about theirbeing so near.
Have you ever had any consultation with fr. Coe about brattices ?-I have sometimes told him we were short of brattices, or sheetings. He always told me if I saw anythuing wanting to let him know. Mr. Coe has reprimanded me for allowing the brattices to be so far from the face. That has beenin the case of boardgates. He has also at times said, in reference to the endings and levels - You must get some brattices up here. But still it has never been our custom to comply with rule 23 in reference to brattices in {he levels, ends, nd slits, nerer having seen any occadon 1or it, because th^re wvas no gas.
Who are Ftge persons who saw nosuch necessity ?-myself, William Beeves, and Wiliam Corbidge. We have consultedtogetherat different times about the brattices not havn been kept up in the ends and levels according to
Has Mr. Cee sanctioned the breach of rule in these reects ?-I am not aware he has been strict with us about tne brattices in the slits or levels; bat he has been very strict about brattices in the boLrdgates. The men working in the boards have cursed and sworn they would go out if we put boards up as ordered by Mr. Coe.
What orders did Mr. Coe give as to bratticesinthe boards ?-He ordered us to keep up with the rule 23.
After the men found fault with having the bratticms so near, did you put them up or keep them down 7Seinmetimes we have put them up and sometimes on persuasion kept them down, the men not being able to keep their candles in on account of the current. We hd wood shaders to protect the candles, but they sweated away to the extent of five or six in the hour. On the day previous to the explosion there were no bratticea in boadgates so much as 12 feet from the face. None of the stoppings or doors were wrong to my knowledge. We have not been in the habit of having more than one slip open near the face of the boardctes or levels. On the day revious to the explosion we
ad not had any greater fal from the roof than nwal There had not been any eat falls of roof on that day, but there had been small fais from the roof, which is what is called a tender one and falls readily. I carefully examined the gooves the day before the explosion with a safety lamp. They were quite clear of as. It was on the evening of 'he day preoeding the exploson I e mined them. I being in the night shift, left the pit about 3 o'clock on the morning of the explosion. I did not ee gas in any place that morning-did not find a single place from one end of the pit to the other where it would fire at my lamp. The lame of my lamp did not show fire at alL We had not one Davy lamp at work on that day in any part of the pit It is very sdldom we have had to use lampg, and when we have it has always been in the boards. I don't know that they have been required in any
lace n cular. The boardgates, which go strAight fronr*henpt bottom are considerably further up than the others. we have not had occasion to use lamps in those boardgates for six mnonths at least, not to my knowledge. We have at times had occasion, when there has boen a "feeder" or "bhower," to use them in the second boardgate, on the north side of the pit. Wehave sometimes had "feeders" or " blowers" of gas. I don't knowv that we have had therm anywhere but in the second boardgates The feeders or blowers were very trifling ones.
Have you always acquainted wr. Coo with it, when you have seen blowers?-I don't recollect that we have had any since Mr. Coe came to the pit, which is only aboat four months ago.
Have you seen Mr. Coe measure the quantity of airin the pit ?-Yes.
With the anemometer ?-Yes.
Where?-In the cupola (air shaft) boardgate, into which the whole ventilation of the pit is brought.
Has rule 23 been obeerved in reference to the sectional area of the airourses?-I cannot speak to that; I don't know what itis
Do you know if there are auy aircourses or aircrossings leSS than 30 square feet sectional area as required by rule 23 ?-Yes, there are some less of both kinds.
What is the size of the emallest ?-We have some not more than 4ft. square, because the roof is so bad that it crushes the packs down.
The Coroner.-I asked you last MEond y if you could at all account for the explosion. After you have had a weeles consideration I now repeat the qnestion. Can you give me any aceount of it except what you gave last week ?-I cannot; Unless, as I said last week, a trap-door may have been left open. We had boys to attend to the trap-doors-one at every door, except those in the slits, which the burriers open and shut themselves.
M1r. Morten.-Has the leaving open of doors often como to your knowledge ?-No; we have nine doors at boards ends, and as near as I can recolect 25 or 26 in slitx.
Mr. W. Haddison, of Barnsley, colliery viever, said,-I heard of the explosion at Lundhill shortly aftaritoccurred and immediately proceecded to the place. I reached there about 20 minutes before 1 oclock in the afternoon. I found the men had just finished fastening the broken chain in the head gear, and busy transferring the ropes on the drum, one of them being fastened to the chair in the bottom. Seeing that I could be of some assistance, I superiutended with one or two others the alterations of the ropes on the drum; and not knowing what other means there were at the coliery, and no one to inform me at hand, and knowing also that we had a " crab" with the necessar length of rope attached I immediately sent for it to Wembwel Main Colliery where I am employed. This " crab" could only be required in case of some unforeseen accident in altering the ropes oE the pit. Every exertion was made, and the uoccupied drawing rope was put into operation a quarter before 3 o'clock. There was no unnecessary delay. I may just sa
that I an the manager at theWombwellMainColiery. As soon as the rope was got into operation, Mr. Cee, along with two of his own men, got into the tub and proceeded down the shaft, being drawn to bank at intervals in consequence of meeting in their descent with pieces of timber haugmg loose in the shaft, and which it was neoessay to remove for their own safety. After being drawn up three or four times they at last reached] the bottom.
Mr. Coe shortly returned to the bank-, and asked ir. Webster and myself to accompany him to the office to examine the plan; whichwe did. Immediatelyafterwards, we all proceeded to the pit, and together with William Utley, underground steward at Wombwell Main Colliery, proceeded to the bottom of the Pit. Wfe had very great difflculty in keeping our lights, thiose in the Davy lamps being atgteblw up, and we were compelled to make use of
a common Blase 4amp in order to obtain a light at the bottom. On getting out of the tub at the bottom, about eight or 10 feet from the rails, we had to scramble over a large amount of fragments, apparently of broken slides and staves. We then went to wht had teen the lamp cavern, where we lt our dead lamps. We immediately proceeded along the south road. The first opening I came to, 15 or 16 yards from the shaft bottom, was a dlrect communication with the bottom of the uSCnt, in which Mr. Coo informed us there had been two doors, but not a vestige of them r*nained. The fire at the bottom of the upeast was raging furiously. The whole of the arches of the furnace were one mass of ruin, and the fire was shooting up between the stones. We could also see fire coming down the centre boardgate directly to the bottom of the upcast sbaft. We saw the Brames shooting across, effectually stopping us from proceeding further. We continued oing to tho rise, stil with the hopo of getting round the fire, and found l he coal on fire at the post of the next corner, but so slight that it was afterwards put out. We got about one puiar bigher than this to the rise, which would be about 70 yards to the rise from the horse-road. At this point Mr. Coo left ns, and went stil further up, until he could proceed no further for want of air. We then returned into the horse-road,
he leaving us at the second boardgate. We went di,ectlv into the horse-road, and he continued along lo the south. He joined us in the horse-road about 100. yards. from the shaft. We proceeded up the southroad about 350 yards, and found three dead bodles Go'
tothe rise, up every boerdgate we came to, until stopped for want of air, -and the gas fired in the lampg, byaond which we considered it ulpafo to proceed, we returned to the downoatahaft. We did not find any persons alioV on the south side of the pit. We then went on the north aide. OJ1 the north horse-road, 10 or 12 yards from the bottom, we saw a iororedvAd, Which ad apparentlyjust come tothe
slaft botom with atmin of woaL. I lhould say lie wa burnt. In front Of Mim had>heen four Or firetu*s eu to the toP of -which lhe ba been blown 'by the explosion. After gtein four or Are Yards fhrther north wo ttrned up the board 2utothe xtabIe sand found one horse dead at the entraoce, and another near i, The stables we found oen Are, the fare being Cei~ePeY onthe ris sdaecteatable., at in thel= Itn'b"aid On the Sufrounding col IV# then went down the no2th horse-road, tnX IT tie first boatandac to get to the other ntd ofthe fire. W .onn

Gudnot bowever perceive any, We thten returned to the north hore-rood, and prooseded along it, havn a cutrent ofair alog gwith us. WeD oundseveral ed diesinthis horse-road. We went up No. 2 boardgate until we agpin loot our air and could proceed 2no furter. The want of air and firing of the lampr. stopped us when we had got 40 or 50 yards up. WAgain returning to the north horse-road we proceeded along it, examining the stopl~ings as wo went-, and finding omoro of them not seriouslY injured we went up No. 3 bordgate about 40 or diO yards, and ha agIn tore tuin in consequnoeof the want ofair andfrn ftegi ourlamps.We continued up thenort os-odutlw reacbed within 40 yards of the facing, and at the end of the fourthboardgate. We then found a body which, I think;, was dreafully burnt, but it was o black I ould not tell positively. Some one of the patty-I think Mr. Coe-prooeeded toa water level, which as being driven in the dip to the east, and where a man would be working at the tin* of the exploidon. His body was found there, and brought into the horse-road. At this titne Warhurst came to us from the shaft bottom, saying, if we did not at once return there would be no means of escape. I should say this would be about a quarter to 7 o'clock. We did not even then eave the No. 4 boardate untHi w had examiLned every direction in which it ws possible for any one to live. One of the pa-I beieve Ar, Coe-went up the No. 4 boardgate. We no case returned until the lamps fired. We also examined minutely three orfour placeswhichwereboing driveato the dipeim}lixto tbhoel have previously poken of but did not find any body dead or living in them, those wno had been working thete having eidentlyceaped. We then returned on the north boardgate, counting the bodies as we passed, and found them to be eight, the la6t of which we not oberved at all in going north, aad onl discoverod it, in returning, fromn my foot touching the by. It wa lying under a tub of cools. On getting near the shaft we again went towards the south end of the stables, in
which we found the fire raging so furioudy that it was I utterlyyimposible forus togo nearit. The whole lengthof thestables,and evidently rom that point to the centre boardgate-a length of upwards of 10i yards-was in one whitesheet of flame. The aides of the col, timbcz, and CTrythin inflammable, were onfire. Itwasfearful to conteruplatet e difference that had talken plce inthestate of the fire between the time of our going up the north boardpato and returning an. In the first instance we might have gone np to the ire and icL-ed it with our feet
uin thecond we durnt not go within several yards of iL We went from the bottom of the downcest to the bottom of the upeast, the whole of the bottom of which was one white heat. Itwas likethe botton of a melting furnace. Before oing Along the north horse-road we bd ordered that the odies ofthe three men found in thesotth horse-road should be brought to the shaft-bottom as quickly sz possible in o-der that they mgt besenttD bank On arivn atth
shaft-bottom from e north horse-road we game simila instructions with respect to the eight dead bod[es found in that horse-road. The men proceeded to perform that duty. We did not leave the pit until I myself felt convinoed beyond a doubt that there could not ie bvpog-ibility any Uring person in the pit, excepting those lwhlo had descended after theexplosion. Wethencame outof thepit. Itwasabout half-past 7 when we got out. We thereupon went to the ofSee to consult with the owners of the colliery as to the best and most efficient means in that emergency. We had not left the pit man minutes before the whole of the men whom we had left dow came out, declaring it utterly impossible for them to remain any longer. When we gotinto theoffice there were present Mr. IL C. Webster, of lioylanid, Mr. Joseph Coo (the. undergund .eward), Ser. Wlliam UTtley, of Wom well amzn
ery, Mr. John Hoyland, of Rawmarsh Colliery, Mr. Duckworth, of Wombwell Main Colliery, James Cookson, of Hoyland, Wlliam Beever, John Warhurst, Benjamin
O landDurleyNorth Main,John Jamnesand Ellis Wilcock, bet of Wombwell Main. All these men are connected with collieries, and had been down the pit. Mr. Taylor (proprietor) and Mir. Peacock (solicitor) were also present There was a consultation, and the question was put to each of them as to whether anything furtber could tbea be done for the recovery of the bodies, or whether, in their oDinion an one was At in the pit. The answer of eac was
am decidedly of opinion, since examining the pit, that there is not now a living person in the pit, and that at this hour (TAO) it would be dangerous for any man to detcend the pit for any purpose wbatever, and that the only way now the fire is raging so fiercelyis to close the downcast shafts, andI think it should ho done immediately." When we came out of the pit there s a very strong current, and the flames were just peeping out of the nupola shaft, and at 7.40 they had risen upwards of 100 feet a=ye the cupola top, and the srks rose to at lest 300 fcet in the air. In pursuance of our unanimous decision we then closed the top of the downcastshafts, leaving the cupola open. I cannot from my examination form any opinion as to what was the cause of the exnlosiou.
By Mr. forton.-Did anyone object to closing the pit'No one. From my experience of oollieries every exertion was made to get into the pit a speedily a posible
Mr. Morton.-Canyou formuany opinion as to the utmost extent of the flames westwards from the bottom of the upeast shaft ?-Upwards of 50 yards when I saw it, but ultimately I sbould say froma 70 to 80 yards west. The western extremity of the flames would be eight yards above the horse-road. There was afterdamp, but not so much of that as of explosive gas. I cannot tel where tbere were the P*&test indications of igmted ga. GMina sate of ignition had prevailed along the horseroad from the two extremes of our Journey, which is nearly half-a-mile. I cannot spk Positively, hut should say that ignited gas had eitdu the several boardgates.
By the Foreman.-I could not have suggested a better plan to get earlier into the colliery. The best means were adopted. Therewas no deficiency of ropes or anything else actually neoessary to get down. Things were sent for, such as duplicate woriongs with the idea that they might possibly be equirped.
The inquiry was proce-eding when our report was sent off.

AN EcMENTBTC LADY.-For eeveral years past the house No. 8, Nurserv.row, Brandon street, Walworth, has been occupied by is Srah Elliott, a maiden lady advanced in years and of most singular and eccentric habits; and, though no doubts were enter tained by her neighbours that she was highly connected, yet none of her friends were observed to vWisit her. On Sunday noon at about half-past 12 o'clock she came down stair and entered the parlour, where it had been the custom of her servant to place half-a-pint of ale, procured on the over night, andthisshe drank, andthis was the last time ahe was seen alive. Her servant, finding at about 3 o'clock that she had given ro orders for dinner, knocked repeatedly at thoe prlour door, and receiving no answer sho became alarm and called mn some of the neighbour& who forced the door open, when ahe was found ling on three chairs, quite dea and cold. The medical man who hod been attending her had been caled in, and it ws his apinion that she died from natural causes. ergeazt Coppin vas subsequently sent for, and that offioer, aceompanied by the coroner's officer, went to the house, and in a small dirty bag which had been found under the head of the deceased as she lay were 40 sovereips and six U1. banknotes. The houso had been at one time rschly furnished, but from neglect it is at present in a deplorable stt 'Thepersonof the doeeased was covered with rags, held together by pins, and it is the opinion of theofficers that there wero notleasth3nm 1om2, 000 to 3,000 pins employed in this, though she had suits of clothes of a costly chcter in her hous. There can be no doubt the deoeed was partial to the bottlo, as the ervant said she bonght her a bottle of wine on Saturday nIght which she fini5hed, and alongside her bed was found abottl of g&, partly empty,
