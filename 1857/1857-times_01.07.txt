Twigtg," and alluded to in the Money Article, the following isa2 brief statement of the facts : On the 2lits of Aurust last. Mr. Hamilton, at the written sugecetiou of his brother, wlio holds a high office in India, addresed a letter to the East India Company, soliciting their sanction to form a rompany for the purpos of constructing a railway in the province of Oundo, A reply, datet the 2-3d of Sleptember, wa4 received. in which the Heon. Court, obeerved, that it was tally sessible of the great Importance of introducting, railway e'mmunicatiou Is. the province of Oude, asd thaut it was prejsired, toi afford every encourlwement and assistanice Tsr that porpose short of gul,nnteeing sa rate of i' teresa, but that It eould only enter into arran,gemuents with a properly c,onstituted sallociation. In consequience of this communication. steps were immediately tak-en for the formation of thin Company;- andesu the loch of November laet, a Deputation from the Board of Direetors waited by appointment on the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Hon. the East India Company, when the subject was discussed, and p-ermission obtained to submit in writing the views of the Directors as to the only practical mode of ens-eying out the objects of the Conmp.Any. Accordingly a letter, dtateni the z6th of November last, signed by the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman, waa sent, accompanied by the prospectus since submitted to the public, and which had been In private circutatlon for several weeks beoreo. Neither frem the correseondence which had taken place nor froma anything which transpired at the intervitw referred to, had the Directors the slightest reason to snppose that any utter Comnpany was in existenae, and as they deemed it essen tial that a giiaranitee should be obtained. it was not intended to submit the undertaking to the public until that point was determinied. The unexpected appeiarance, however, of another Company rendered it necessary to depart from the original ixeten ion, and to submnit this ashleme writhout further delay, otherwlee it might have be suprsedthattheprirityof ormaionwasceded to the other Oom-A~.

MOjNBY-MA RKETand CITYINTELLGEGVCB. Tuesday Eyening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is25.17j' per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. 10Td. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gola is nearly 6O4ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13.2k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 8-lOths per' cent. dearer in Haamburg than in London. The coiuse of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days'sight is 1081 per cent., which, as eompared with the Mint par between the twoconntries, shows that the exchange is slightly against England; and, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The English funds opened to-day at the duU quo-! tations of last evening, but *ubsequently assumedc' steadiness. The first price of Consols for money was 93 to 94, and they left,off at 94 to i for money, and 94j to b for the 5th of February. This was the first day for private transfers after the shutting of the Consol books, and the amount of stock brought to market was less than usual on such occasions. Money was therefore in good supply, and out of doors also the demand was only moderate. Bank Stock left off at 216i to 218; Reduced, 94- to g ; New Three per Cents, 94 to t; Exchequer-bonds, 98g to 99; India-bonds, 2s. discount to 2s. premium ; and Exchequer-bills, Is. to 5s. premium. Althoiigh there has been an absence of pressure in the discount market during the last two days the payment of the dividends on Thursday is not expected to be followed by any material increase in the supply of money, the amounts to be repaid to the Bannk of England for advances made on commercial bills during the shutting being exceedingly heavy. Foreign seeurities have not presented any material variation, and quotations continue to be fairly supported. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 95B and i, and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at 103A and J. The other transaetions comprised-Mexican, for the account, 214 and ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. Small, 97('; and Spanish New Deferred, 24. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Hambturg was rather lower. With regard to other places there was no alteration from' last post. The closing prices from the Paris Bourse this evening again failed to arrive. About 23,0001. of gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation. The public meeting to be held to-morrow week on the state of the law with respect to warrants for goods will be regarded with great interest, Meanwhile it is to be remarkedc that although the point for discussion seems as simple as possible, there is a tendency in most of the comments made upon it in legal quarters to embarrass it by raising some of those distinctions which, accordino to the usual habits of thought of professional persons, should always be left open in every question. Thus, in the view of these gentlemen there is nothing to caUl for any remedial measure, the only thing necessary I being that the public who handle dock-warrauts should always keep the proper subtleties in mind. By one authority it is observed that as the judgment i of the Court of Exchequer in the case of "Kingsford versu,s Merry" may be conceived to have been reversed I by the Court of Error upon some difference re- 1 garding a matter of fact rather than upon the precise law of the case, commercial men need not feel alarmed, as the law is only left as it was before, the point of fact thus referred to being apparently whether the warrants on which Mr. Merry advanced 2,0001. were obtained by Johnson through a vir- ' tual contract with Kingsford, or by direct and unmitigated fraud. A correspondent-a barristersupports this arg,ument, and says, " It wiU thus be seen that dock-warrants are as safe as ever ;" while another authority-a solicitor of the highest experience-confirms their comnrunications, and adds, " It never was the law of England that a thief could by robbery acquire a title to goods, to enable him to pledge them against the owner." The merchants, bankers, and dealers interested in the question must be careful, therefore, at the approaching meeting to prevent being drawn I into interminable confusion. Their ground is simply this. Hitherto, in all the immense transactions of the metropolis, dock warrants have been treated as a security equal to Bank-notes, the holder being' liable to no question beyond that of having honestly acquired them by the payment of a full considera-. hon. In the present case no one pretends to dispute that this was the position of Messrs. Merry. There is consequently no other point at issue than whether these warrants are good, under all circutmstances, in the hands of an innocent party. Chief Baron Pollock and his colleagues on the bench all: concurTed in the opinion, that " f a bond fide trans-! action like this was to be impeached no man would , be safe, and business could not be transacted in a great commercial city like London." The Court of: Error have decided that it can be impeached, and the mercautile commnunity feel that they are in the position so described. Assuming the law to be as stated by the Court of Error, the consideration is, should it be forthwith altered, or should the safe conduct of all the principal business of the metropolis be sacrificed ? The plea that such cases as the present would be of rare occurrence is of no avail to satisfy the commercial community, since, althougha ruin might fallonly once in 50 years upon some individual, every one would be liable to the daily apprehension that it night be his fate immediately. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the evil would thus be restricted. Supposing that the holder of warrants for a fair consideration is to be compelled at any time after the transaction to surrender the property so acquired, litigation will constantly be adopted to extend the principle in every conceivable way. If, without regard to mercantile wishes and usages, the dogma that no title can be i maintained which has at a former stage been tainted ! by fraud, must be held sacred, therecan be no ground in equity for the exemption of Bank-notes, endorsed bills, bills of lading, or stocks or bonds; and in that case, as has already been pointed out, securities on vhich Sir John Paul obtained advances might fairly at any time be wrested from their last possessors. The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state, that although business had been limited prices were well maintained. Sugar, cotton, and indigo ex-hibited firmness, and in some descriptions of coffee there was a tendency to improvement. Attention was called on Mllonday, by the letter of a correspondent, to the regulation adopted by bankers of refusing to pay checks in which there iS any discrepancy between the fig res in the corner and the sum written in the body, and it was su-Y gested that it would be a safer and more convenient course if, instead of refusing payment altogether, they wele to pay the smaUer amount. The annexed commiuiiication seems to show that, according to law, the sum written in the body, whether it be the larger or smaller amount, is that which is to be met:- "Sir,-Thio following extract from Byles on Bills of Exchanye, pages, 5s-9, may be taken as an answer to the letter in your city article of this morning, from 'A Meember of the Stock Bxchan9e)' "' The sum for which a bill is made payable is usually M ritten in the body of the bill in words at length-the better to prevent alteration-and, if there be any difference between the sum in the body and the sum superscribed, the sum mentioned i the body wvill be taken to be that for whic the bill is made payable; when the figures express A larger sum thzan the words, evidence to show that the difference arose fromn an accidental omission of words is inadmnissible.' "The law is perfectly clear, and, refusing to pay, the banker takes the reiponsibility upon himself. "Your obedient servant, "S City, Jan. 5. X "A MIERcnANT." Great anxiety has prevailed throughout the day regarding the Ostend mail steamer Violet. Her time of departure from Ostend last evening was halfpast 6. She should have arrived in the course of the night, and apprehensions are entertained of her having been lost on the Goodwin Sands. Her complement of hands is about 17. She is partially insutred. Arrangements have been entered into between the Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company, by which the steamers hitherto running under the mail contract between Hongkong and Shanghai Will call at the intermediate p)orts of Amoy, Chow-foo-C5hoo and Ningpo to land and receive mails. Advices from Sydney state that the Dunbar had arrived on the 27th of September, having made the passage in 88 days.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, JAs, 6. There has been very little business transacted this morning. There appears to be plenty of buyers 'with orders t, execute, but the prices demxnded are beyond their limits. Since this day week cotton has undergone a further advance, and yams and cloth are, consequently, again dearer; and there is this now feature in the market-thab producers, or sellers, as well as buyers, are becoming alarmeci about the continued advance wlhich is takine place in the raw material and in manufactutred goods, which they fear must lead to serious embarrassment, unless some means are taken to check it. There is, consequently, a good deal of talk about a resort to short time among the miWowners as the most effectual mode of lessening the demand for the raw materiaL There are no stocks pressing upon the market, and manufacturers have orders which will last them some time forward, yot, for the reasons 'we have stated, prices are only nominally higher, because buyers decline to operate, except for small and preSSing orders. In yarns, as in cloth, the same feature is apparent. Spinners are mostly nr der orders, and are in a positi m to .stand out for prices proportionod to the rise in cotton, and this virtually stops any business of magnisude from being transacted. Letters from Glasgow mention the failure of Messr. Begbie, Wiseman, and Co., general merehants and manufacturers, with liabilities to the amount of 150,000l., of which nearly 20,000. faU upon houses in this city. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- "Since our last report there has been very little basinesm done i any kind of goods, the high and graduaUy advancing prices causing buyers to keep out of the market for all but pressing orders. Manufacturers, on the other hand, are, in the present excited state of the cottonunarket, equally careless of selling, and, of course, there is little or nothing doing, and prices are merely nominal." LEEDS, JAN. 6. The tone of the woollen cloth-market this morning has been quite satisfactory, and, considering the limited quantity of cloth in the halls, a ful average atnount of business has been done. The report of this day's Huddersfield woollon-market ig as follows :-The general state of the market is slightly inproved. Some representatives of shipping houses are in, and make the trade in lowa goods brisk. For fancies of ali kinds there are inquirers, and the newest patterns find ready purchasers. WVool still maintains a tendency to advance.

THE BOMBARDMENT OF CANTON. ADMIRALTY, JAr. 5. (From the London Gazee of Tuesday. Jan. 6.) "'he following despatches have been received from :R. :-r-Admniral Sir Michael Seymour, K.C.B., Commaiider-in-Chief of Her Majesty's ships and vessels e the East India and China Station " OrPEY.t-rnzo" AT CxLroce. No. 103. Niger, at Canton, Nov. 14, 1856. *Sir,-In the sixth paragraph of my general letter, No. 91, *f the lth ult., I alluded to the Chinese authorities having a few days previously forcibly seized the native crew of a lorcha under English colours, andthat I had demanded redress. 2. I have now the honour to report, for the informaLion of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that on the 8th of October the lorcha Arrow, with a colonial register from the Governor of Hongkong, was boarded while Gt anchor at Canton by a (:hinese officer and a party of solLliers, who, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the 3master, an Englishman, seized 12 of her crew, bound and carried them away, and hauled down the British flag. Her Miajesty's Consul afterwards remonstrated vwith the officer Vrho ha4 seized the men, but without effect. "3. 1;i4s outrage was immediately brought to the notice of the Imperial High Commissioner by Mr. Parkes, Her lLajesty's Consul, who required the 12 men to be returned to the Arrow by the same officer who had carried them away; that an apology should be made, and an assurance given that the British flag should in future be respected. rEheir Lordships will, however, observe, on perusing the dsocuments which accompany this despatch, that, although [he 12 men were eventuaUy sent back, it was not in the public manner in which they had been carried away, aud Pll appearance of an apology was pointedly avoided. " 4. On the 11th of October this unpleasant occurrence Was officiaUy reported to me by Sir John Bowring, Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary in China, and his Excellency sag. gested that the seizure of an Imperial junk would probably produce the desired reparation. I accordingly directed Commodore the Hon. C. G. J. B. EUiot, of Her Majesty's ship SybiUe, senior officer in the Canton river, to carry out Sir John Bowring's suggestion, and I despatched the Barracouta steam sloop and Coromandel tender to afford him the means of doing so. A junk was seized,* but it led to nlothing. I then sent Her Majesty's steam frigates Encounter and Sampson to join the Commodere (the former to lie off the factory), in the hope that the presence of such an imposing force would show the High Commissioner the prudenceof complying with our demands, buthisl:~xcellency appeared determided on resistance. "5. At this period Mr. Parkes proceeded to Hongkong to consult with Sir John Bowring and myself as to the best mneasures of compulsion to be adopted, and we aU considered that the seizure of the defences of the city of Canton would be the most judicious, both as a display of power without the sacrifice of life and of our determination to enforce redress-experience of the Chinese character having proved ihat moderation is considered by the officials only as an 0vidence of weakness. " G. I immediately moved the Calcutta above the Bogus forts, as high up as her draught of water permitted,7and on the morning of the 23d of October proceeded on board the Coromandel steam-tender for Canton, with the Sampson and Barracouta in company, and the detachments of Royal MIarines and boats' crews of Her Majesty's ships Calcutta, Winchester, and Bittern, and the boats of the Sybille, with the Commodore. On approaching the Blenheim Reach I diverted the Sampson and a portion of our force up the Macao passage, to prevent the Chinese from stopping up the channel, and to capture the Blenheim Fort, I then weent on vwith the Coromandel and Barracouta to the Four Barrier Forts, about five miles below the city. Anchoring the two steamers above the forts, I despatched the boats and took possession of them. An ill-iudged attempt at resistance from two of the forts, which fired on our ships and boats, resulted in the death of five Chinese soldiers. There were about 150 guns, from one foot bore to four-pounders. " 7. I now directed Commander Fortescue, in the Barracouta, to follow the Sampson, and having spiked the guns, destroyed the carriages and ammunition, and burnt the buildings in the forts, I proceeded to Canton, where I arrived at 2 p.m., and learnt that the boats from the Sampson and Rarracouta had taken quiet possession of the Blenheim Fort, and also of Macao Fort, a very strong position on an island in the middle of the river, mounting 86 guns, which I have garrisoned and shall retain for the present. " 8. Her MIajesty's Consul, by my direction, immediately infornied the Eligh Coiusissioner of my arrival and of the aggressive measures which he had compelled me to take in consequence of his refusal to redress the wrong committed by his officers; also that I should continue such proceedings tZntil reparation should be made. His Excellency's reply was very unsatisfactory. "9. On the morning of the 24th 1 landed a portion of the imarines to aid the detachments from the SybiUe and Encounter, already at Canton, in the protection of the factory, and proceeded in the Coromandel to join the Barracouta, off Macao Fort. Then, at a preconcerted signal, the Bird's -Yest Fort, mounting 35 guns, and a smaU fort opposite the city, which msight have annoyed the faetory, were taken wvitlhout opposition, as were subsequently the Shamin Forts at the head of the llacao Passage; the whole of the gnuns were renderad unserviceable and the ammunition destroyed. " 10. As the state of affairs now appeared so very unpromising, I considered it advisable to take effectual measures for the protection of the factory. The remainder of the Royal Marines and a body of small-arm men were therefore landed. Advanced posts and field pieces were stationed at all the assailable points, barricades thrown across the streets, and the boats kept vigilant watch to guard against the approach of fire-rafts and attacks by water. The execution of this important duty I intrusted to Captain V. K. Hall, C. B., my flag-captain, whose zeal and activity throughout the whole of the operations I cannot too highly commend. The Royal Marines were in charge of Captain P. C. Penrose, R.2., of Her Majesty's ship Winchester, who showed great ability and promptitude, " Captain Cowper, Royal Engineers, who had been sent I'oTn Hongkong to afford me the benefit of his professional experience, was of great assistance in pointing out and remedying the weak points in our position. "A body of Amiierican officers, seamen, and marines, under Commander Foote, of the United States' corvette Portsmouth, provided for the interests of the American cosumunity. * 11. On the 25th I took possession of the Dutch Folly, a fort with 50 guns, on a smaU island opposite the city, where I afterwards placed a body of 140 officers and men, under Commander Rolland, of the Calcutta. All the defences of the city being now in our hands, I considered the High Commissioner would see the necessity of submission, and I directed Mr. Parkes to write and state that when his Excel. lency should be prepared to arrange the points in dispute in a satisfactory manner I would desist from farther operationas; but the reply did not answer my expectations. " An attack was niade at 12.30 p.m. by a body of troops, sup ported by a mnuch layger force, which occupied the streets in the rear. Mr. Consul Parkes was on tho spot at the time and warned them to retire, but ineffectually. The gnard of Poyal Marines, in charge of Captain Penrose, then quickly drove theni back, with a loss, as we understand, of 14 kIlled and wounded. ' 12. The 26th, being Sunday, was observed as a day of rest. "1 13. Early on the morning of the 27th I caused another letter to be wvritten to the High Commissioner, to the effect that, as satisfaction had not been offered for the affair of the Arrow, I should resume offensive operations; and his Excellency having, by his illegal measures and determination to refuse reparation, produced this display of force, I concurred in opinion, with Sir John Bo wring that this was a fittinig opportunity for requiring the fulfilment of longevaded treaty obligations; and I therefore, in addition to the original demands, instructed Mr. Parkes to make the following communication:- "'That, to prevent the recurrence of evils like the present, which have been occasioned by the disregard paid by the Imperial Commissioner to the repeated applications for redress and satisfaction made to him by letter in the matter of the Arrow by Fier Majesty's Plenipotentiary and the Consul-writing, in consequence of the closing of the city to foreigners, being the only means of communicationI demapded for aU foreign representatives the same free access to the authorities and city of Canton (where all the Chinese higlwfficials reside) as is enjoyed under treaty at the other foPports, and denied to us at Canton alone.' "N No reply having been made, I determined to open fire on the High Commissioner's compound (the Yamun), a large space of ground within the old city, surrounded by a high wall, which contains his Excellency's residence, and is consequently Government property. Accordingly, at 1 p.m. the first shot was fired from the 10-inch pivot gun of the Encounter, and, at intervals of froum five to ten minutes, the fire was kept up from that gun till sunset. The Barraconta at the same time shelled the troops on the hils behind Gough's Fort, in the rear of the city, from a position she had taken up at the head of Sulphur Creek. "A proclamation was this day issued, under the High Commissioner's own seal, and placarded publicly, offering a reward of 30 dollars for the head of every Englishman. One of the originals is in posession of Her Majestys ConsuL Nearly all the Chineso servants now quitted the factory.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND PUBLIC EXECUTIOK&. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T13fES. Sir,-In the discussion at present perniitted in your columns (so greatly for the public benefit) of questions -relating to crime and criminaLs the subject of capital punishment and public executions has been briefly noticed. AUow mo to add a few thoughts upon both these points. Death punishment, as it used to ba inflicted, for offences against inere proporty was wholly abhorrent to the spirit of Christianity, and no less so to reason. Death punishment for murder is consonant with both, and is the most consistent part of our whole penal judicature, wvhich protects, as a general rule, property too much and the person too little. For instance, what can be more paradoxical than the everyday administration of our criminal law in casos like the foUowing:-A brutal man picks a quarrel vwith a neighbour, or a publican, perhaps; knocks out his adversary's teeth, or breaks his head with a pewter pot, and for the offence gets six, or at most 12 months' imprisonment, with an admonition and lecture from the judge. Another, a hungry wretch, steals the pewter pot, and for a certainty is awarded, at the least, four years' penal servitude; it used to be transportation beyond the seas. t gain, a forocious savage gouges out with his thumub the eye of an enemy, whom he has provoke;d (I speak of no imaginary cases), or maltreats his wife aImost to death ; he, too, receives a lec. ture from the bench upon his brutality, and is sent for a few months to a house of correction. A pitiful roguo pilfers s purse, an eyeglas3, a toothpick, or a pockethandkerchief from the porson; he is consigned to a convict prison for as many years. All this is defensible, of course, by lawyers, but in the judgment of common sense it is preposterous .nd absurd, unless it can be proved that a quart pot is more precious than a man's unbroken skull, or an eyeglass than the eye itself. In the death penalty for murder there is no such anomaly. Life has been taken away by wicked hands. The life of the murderer pays the equiva. Lent penalty to justice. The peaceable and orderly members of society are exposed to the insidious or open attack of the murderer, or the robber armed with dangerou; weapons; the murderously disposed are intimidated *nd kept in check by the condign punishment before their eyes occasionally of some guilty person of their own stamp ; and the thief class is taught that, however the laws may deal with mere rob bery, they will assuredly be avenged to the utmost upon all who violate the sacredness of human life in the pursuit of their nefarious trade or otherwise. Some theorists say that death has little terrors for men of this sort; such a notion is contrary to all experience and com. mon sense. With regard to public executions, I do not hesitate to giva my opinion that, even as they are at present managed in England, they rre, upon the whole, salutary in their effects. You want to mad a terrible lemson to those clamses from which most danger is to be feared. The very scum of society become at once the audience, and a most attentive one. That the language and bearing of many in such a congreg4. tion should be vile and revolting in the extreme must be expected. It does not require the graphie pen of a Dickens or a Thackeray to give to the mind such a picture of London rascality upon these occasions as shall disgust or horrify, but it may be safely questioned whether this be really the character of the mass-even of that worst assemblage of England's lowest populace. I do not believe that it is, from what I have seen of London gatberings of a low sort on other occasions,vnd from what I have heard from matter-offact witnesses concerning public executions. That thieves practise their art under the gallows I can roadily believe. A regular thief would steal, sf he could, a convertible sovereign'sworth from the dying man ; while to pick the hangman',, pocket wrould be high fun, and an exploit worthy of " Jack Sheppard.' But the question is. will thieves feel more disposed, or less so, after the dread specotacle, to add murder to their robbery, and will murderous men and women feel more or less ready to mix the fatal draught or prepare the deadly ra7.r for some UDSUSpecting victim? I amn satisfied myself that most of their number will be intimnidated thereby, and kept from the evil deed, and that innocent life will bo saved by the condign death of the guilty. Some persons would invest the scene with more of a religious character; but it iay be questioned whether there is not already too free * use on such occasions by custonm of at least one ordinance of religion, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, so usually administered to the condemned; for the public horror at an enormous crime cannot but be mitigated in some measure by observing tho easy transition from the most guilty condition to a recogni7ed state of holy communion with God and His faithful peonle Ilr. Bowyer, in his late letter in your columns on public executions, thking the colouring of our novelists when they describe an English scene of the kind as unexaggerated truth, draw s by way of contrast a picture of how things are done of this kind in countries which represent lbis adopted faitlh, especiaily Italy; but it has been already observed by "Truth" in four colunmns there canmot be much valuo in 3ir. Bowyer's anuded procemsions And eMUoniil, seeing that they do not keep down the excessive proportion of the awful crime in those countries in the least-indeed, they nsay help to increase it. "Truth" says the number of murders in thesonthof Burope is" fourfold" the proportion in England. But it is vastly snore, and, in fact, ienurmierable; frome the state of those countries, iunrders aro nearly fouirfold in Ireland, to which M r. Bowyer aLso refers the Enghlsh people for an exanmple, a*d about the sa me in France. In Great Britain the proportion annually is not more than one in a milLion, and that one is frequently a foreigner or of a foreign religion. Better to have few murders, clumsy executions, an ill. conducted assemnblge (if this be true), and, withal. a people ympuathiziu wvith the laws, than a land suturated with nanvenged blood, executions of assassins attended with all the pomp ol a processional faith, and a people exasperated, in the o main, at the laws, and even the religion, of their country, as is the case too notoriously in Italy, whether Austrian, Yeapolitan, or Papal. I have thea )onour ;s} be. Sir, your obedijent servant. Jk^rS KINGSNSALL Ohanla,. eantuzvill Prison.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, JrA1UAY 7, 1857. In the ancient epic the hero was prepared for 'his crowning conflict with a special panoply from HIeavens own workshops. Some strange mishap, or vulgar wear and tear, had fortunately compelled a fresh equipment; and the parent goddess accordingly rose up from the ocean, or descended from the sky, with a complete set-out of all that a soldier could require in those days. The incident is so pleasing and so suggestive that, often as it has been reproduced, we are not surprised to see it once more on the stage of political romance. Prussia, magnanimous Prussia, the practical, the philosophical, the great social and religious reformer, is about to enter on a grand struggle. It is not on any one of the great battle-fields of Europe; it is not round the old empire of the East, or the sites of a more sacred antiquity; it is no battle of nations; no Thermopyhle, no Fuenterrabia, no cause as yet ennobled in the eyes of liberty. No. Great Prussia, which stretches her eagle wings across Central Europe from Russia to France, which holds the key of mighty rivers, and professes to be, if anything, at least a great military Power, is about to invade the occupants of a few mountain valleys. Helvetia, the very soil of liberty, which nature itself made the austere mother of the brave and the free, is threatened, indeed on the point of being attacked, by a Power that can raise half a million of trained soldiers. We gladly leave it to the inventive genius of Prussia to describe the grand principles marshalled against one another in this unusual struggle. A Court poet might possibly invest it with nobility, as easily as a tailor or a valet might make up a stage hero, but we resign a task which passes our powers. Whatever the nature of the conflict, Prussia and Switzerland are the antagonists. It is the taller champion, the GOLIATH of the battle, that New Yearfs-day saw aimed for the glorious occasion. Prussia was represented in the person of a Royal Prince, the Ki-eo's brother, who has happily just entered his fiftieth year of military service. The jubilee has been celebrated as military States can do these things, and last Thursday saw a ceremonial which carries one backl to medieval, to classic, to still earlier times-to ValhaUas and demigods. AU Prussia, by a thousand elaborate military delegations, attenlded to bless the veteran ACHILLES and his new arms, while Russia, Austria, and even England-nay, England especiaUy-gave their ready countenance. It is so many years since we wrote Latin verses that we may be excused if we caunot do the description of the several weapons quite as we ought to do. The catalogue is rather a long one. First comes the swcrd, with which, after the example of ROLAND, Prussia is to cut a breach in the high wall of the Jura. It was the gift of the Knia, and seems to have been considered a family affair. With what strange Teutonic rites it was consecrated for the destruction of freedom, with what so!enm exhortations it was delivered, mortal pen cannot telL. The prezentation was strictly private, and for the description of the sword, the precise weight of pure gold, the Archangel, the dragon, the genius of Justice and guardian angels, the palm-leaves, and catalogue of great battles inscribed on the blade, we are indebted to our faithful correspondent. Th,e officers of the army, represented by that redoubted warrior the King of PRUSSIA, presented a magnificent shield, containing as many Victories, crosses, armorial bearings, attributes of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers, portraits of the BRANIDE)M3IRG family, oaks and laurels, orders, eagles, and " glaves," as could be comprised in a diameter of 22 inches. As the Swiss have no intention of invading Prussia the shield is a matter of minor importance, and wo are not surprised either at its generally pacific or purely historical character. The Landwehr and the veterans of the o'd wars of Prussia presented the Prince with a splendid cazque of silver and gold, in which the dragon again makes his appearance, and is slain this time by Sr. GEOrGE. This refers, we are told, to the suppression of the Baden Revolution ; but, as Baden is now wanted to repay that good turn by helping Prussia to suppress Switzerland, the helmet is probably as significant of the future as of the past. Our correspondent was evidently overwhelmed with the crowd of brilliant deputations, and the rap;d succession of audiences, ceremonies, speeches, and replies, so he does not give all the list ; but there was another sword with a gold hilt, and there was a column of silver gilt to represent the soundness and stability of Prussia's pretensions at Neuchatel. We come now to the most remarkable gift of all. Sir COLIN CASIPBELL, the hero of Balakleva, was there, with an English deputation, to present the Grand Cross, Star, and Colar of the Order of the Bath. According to the statutes of that Order it cannot be conferred on a foreigner unless he has fought side by side with British troops ; so we are left to seek on what occasion the Prince of PRUSSIA fulfilled this condition. On the one hand, he and the Duke of WELLINGTON entered France from the opposite points of the compass A.D. 1814 ; on the other hand, Prussia is to invade Switzerland in about a week from the present date. WVhich of these two incidents bears the most directly on the admission of the Prince of PRuSSIA to the Order of the Bath? As one reads the account of this gorgeous military spectacle in the Rotunda of a Royal palace one pauses to glanee every now and then at that other glorious amphitheatre, that fabric of rock upon rock, and those everlasting wals-at another scene, the very opposite in every respect. At Berlin it is the family, the Court, the Ministers, the army in every possible form and branch, notables, corporations, and foreign Ministers. The members of the Royal Family make speeches to one another, and cheer one another, and make presents to one another, and there is not a soul present who has not his orders for the occasion. In that other ampitheatre, where the vast circle, the columns, the receding vistas, are all nature's own, a whole population is arming to defend their ancient patrimony from the heel of despotism. They are doing it without any state or show, for they need none of these things. They have no occasion to caU in the aid of the military tailor or the goldsmith, of angels and dragons, and other customary ways of describing an indifferent cause, for they are doing the simplest thing in the world. They are defending their own independence, their own soil, their own homes. They are doing this not only for themselves, but also for that liberty and that misfortune that have so often found an asylum urder the shadow of those moun- tains, and on the shores of those lakes. They are fighting for a substance, while Prussia threatens to launch her immense military power and jeopardize afresh the peace of Europe for the merest shadow in the world, a thing which it is reaUy' impossible to define in the language of common sense-a thing which is and is not, and which was only allowed to exist on the condition of its existence never being recognized. There could not be a quarrel more happily imagined to throw everlasting ridicule on royal titles, obsolete claims, and dynastic complications. As for the issue, there can be no doubt, for we will back the Swiss in their natural fortresses against all the Prussians in Europe; but we still hope and trust that the sense of Europe will not let it come to that.
We have recently published two fiesh contributionis towards the literature of the transportation question. The first proposes to place omr convicts round the coast in gangs, to labour at public works, such as harbours of refuge ana fortification& The second corespondent casts. his eyes on the Hebrides, the decline of whiclh mfy date from the doLs when they cesef to be t.ltsunks. of Norwegian pirates, and t.be reviyal. eC wbih is ko comene from thea time they are once more made the abode of crMle and violence. Seeing them to possess a climate so humid, so misty, and so variable that it is only occasionally it brings the produce of the earth to perfection, and that the only profitable industry of w hich they are susceptible, since bariUa drove kelp out of the market, is the pasture of sheep and cattle, our correspiondent proposes to soW theni thick with felons, destined to live on corn brought from Canada, to cut and stack peat, and to grow, when they can persuade the weather to let them, grainless oats and slimy potatoes. In this Hebridean pandemonium there are to be, as in the Inferno of DANrrT, different circles for different offences ;-hard rocks for stony-hearted burglars, green meadows for sentimental pickpockets, and sandy beaches on which the detected forger may trace with a stick the toowell-remembered outline of a counterfeit note of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. From Ossian to the Xetvgate Calendar the transition is rather abrupt; but we will make a sacrifice of the sentimentalities, endeavour to divest the scheme of those associations, and look at the deportation to the Hebrides as a matter of business, just as the devout Lord of Session did who deported his termagant wife, little more than a hundred years ago, to perish on the remote rock of St. Kilda. The scheme appears to us to labour under the capital defect that theconvict colonywould have nothing to do, would be utterly unable to support itself, and would necessarily be employed in works of the very slightest utility. Far preferable would be the scheme of " A PRACTICA.L MAL?-," who would employ convicts in England in doing work that is actually wanted. The objection to his system of worliing in gangs, however, has always been found to be, that the whole gang sinks down to the level of the very worst man in it, and that, so far from beinig a means of reformation-of which amnong criminals once hardened there is, in our opinion, little hope,-the gang is sure to dismiss the criminal a very much worse man than it found him. But, after all, neither of these plans even alludes to the real difficulty that lies at the bottom of every proposal for secondary punishment. The difficulty is not what to do with a crimninal while he is uadergoing his sentence, but what to do with him when that sentence has been fulfilled. Both plans seem to contemplate that the prisoner, having fulfiUed the labour demanded of him by the State as an expiation of his crime, and having enjoyed during the period of involuntary seclusion the society of those most capable of supplying defects in his felonious education, should be turned adrift in this wealthy and populous country, without character, without honest occupation, but with insatiable desires, and the vile dexterity, cmnning, and ferocity required to minister to their gratification. Penal servitude may deter others, may terrify the criminal himself, but it has seldom made a wiser, and never a better man. The answer to the proposition to let loose upon this country such pests as convicts who have served their sentence is, that we cannot and will not endure it. Society exists for the honest and the virtuous, and it would be utterly to invert her purpose were she to suffer the community to be made the prey of men whose subsistence depends on the habitual violation of her laws. No plan of secondary punishment can be considered as even plausible which does not provide for the expatriation of the criminal for the whole remainder of his life. The old system of transportation did this effectually. WVhatever the sentence,-7, 10, 14, or 21 years,-it was virtually a sentence of banishment for life. The number of years prescribed regulated the period of forced labour and prison discipline in the penal colonies, but when the period had expired there was no inducement to return to England, and every temptation for the criminal to remain where he was. The emancipated convict found himself on the expiration of his sentence in a highly advantageous position. He was a member of a thriving and advancing community, where wages were high, and the acquisition of property by honest means easy. The presence of a large number of his own class mitigated the feeling of shame and relieved the consciousness of degradation, and the criminal became, if not an honest man, at any rate one whose sympathies were enlisted by the acquisition of wealth in favour of the proprietor and against the thief. This was one solution of the problem how to deal with an expiree convict, but it is one no longer open to us to adopt. The Antipodes are no longer unknown and unexplored regions, and the fact that such a destiny awaited the criminal would now become notorious, and rob transportation of its salutary terrors. Besides, we cannot afford to be always founding new penal colonies, which are to attract to them free emiigrants, who wil soon learn in the midst of a rapidly-acquired prosperity to look with disgust on its origin, and insist on banishing from among them that criminal element which want and necessity made endurable, but which abumdance and prosperity have rendered intolerable. The principles of demand and supply wiU easily absorb our expiree criminals in the first instance, but the free development of the commiuiity in which they prevail will soon end by expelhng them altogether. The result is that we cainot trust to the free action of the laws of political economy to preserve to us our penal settlemuents. Nor is this wonderful. The law of the development of communities is freedom, while the very nature of a penal colony implies constant interference, repression, and coercion. If, then, we are to found penal colonies, we must preserve and stereotype their harsher and more repulsive features. They must be places of punishment and places of abode for persons who have undergone punishment,-not for free settlers untainted with crime. Wherever we fix our penal colony, it is absolutely necessary that that place should be the home of the criminal for the rest of his life. If the sitvation be in Australia, the colonies would never endure, nor ought they to endure, the infiltration of the crime of Great Britain in the shape of felons who had served their sentences in another part of the continent. If any portion of America be selected, the same observation would apply with equal force to Canada and the United States. Where the convict is Eent he must re- main; we cannot, without danger of dismembering the empire or involving it in serious wars, suffer him to leave the place of his punishment for a colony or tle territory of any friendly nation. The period of penal servitude may be short or long, but the residence in the penal colony must be for life. The tie that binds the expiree to the soil should be not, as heretofore in Australia, his own preference, but a power he cannot resist. In softening the hardship of his lot, in holding out incentives to good conduct, in allowing the acquisition by honest labour of a certain amount of competence and comfort, yet without permitting those scandalous acquisitions of enormous wealth the occurrence of which in Australia did so much to neutralize the terrors of transportation, will be shown the foresight of the legislator and the tact of the disciplinarian. Such a society will be, of necessity, highly artificial, supplying by positive rules many of those things which in ordinary communities are wisely left to provide for themselves; but it is, after all, nothing more than extending to a large and isolated district the samw method andil order as are appled to a prison, the inmates of wMhis are subjoct to every degree of pnishment, iom simple detention to the severe lubour exaciA fEm hau bd , effeaders. There i5 no reason why such a commuiiti, -separated from the re-t of the world aud forbidden to free settlers, should not continue to absorb for ages the crime which is intolerable to this country, striking a salutary terror into the evil-disposed here, and saving the criminals as much as possible from mutual contamination by scattering them thinly over the surface of a large and isolated region.
In the columns of our impression on Satarday appeared an exposition of the "trade of 1856" so remarkable in its character that we bespeak thereader's attention a little further to the tone and purport of the commentary. The statement in question was given through the medium of those annual circulars which are issued by leading houses in various departments of business, and that the information thus conveyed must have assumed this year an aspect of even more than usual importance will be very readily understood. In the last twelvemonth we have passed from a state of war to a state of peace-a transition necessarily operating with enormous influence upon all the transactions of trade. Such a period, in fact, takes the character of a crisis, involving a sudden and most material change in many of the conditions by which the proceedings of commerce are regulated. In the present case the ports of Russia were reopened, and the productions of that country liberated, while at the same moment the necessity of seeking substitutes for those commodities in other markets was greatly diminished. Add to this, as a general result, that war no longer called for its aliment in the shape of vast supplies conveyed by innumerable ships, and it will be seen at once how extensively the operations of trade must have been influenced by the somewhat unexpected conclusion of peace. Now, the remarkable feature in the documents before us is to be found, not in the contradiction of any of the assumptions which in such a case might be naturally made, but in the extraordinary completeness with which the disturbing elements were counteracted by correctives arising out of the same circumstances, and by the healthy condition of trade itself. The cessation of the war, with its adventitious exigencies and its arbitrary restrictions, did affect commercial transactions immediately and seriously; it did occasion rapid falls of prices, and here and there even created panics, but the panics were brief, the rally was certain, and in a short time the trade is pronounced to be as prosperous and as promising as before. Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which this counterpoise appears established-some times almost insensibly-sometimes by the influence of concurrent circumstances, but everywhere to such a degree as to restore confidence almost as soon as alarm had been created. To begin with, we take ouir cotton manufactures -not, indeed, as being directly affected by the Russian war so much as other departments of industry, but as possessing such immense and intrinsic importance. Here we learn that profits have been small-so small, in fact, as to prove occasionally insufficient, while money, as is well known, was dear; yet we are told that the trade has fuUy shared in the " unexampled energy" characterizing the general industry of the country, and that the extent of business was so large as to compensate for the narrow margin of gain. The total exports of cotton-yarn and manufactures will show, it is estimated, an increase for the past year of 10 per cent. over 1855, and 20 per cent. over 1854. We are further informed that the working classes have been "well and constantly" employed; that the trade of the districts referred to has escaped disturbance from the state of the money-market, and that " accounts have been " quite as regularly paid" as in previous years. In the Scotch iron trade, again, notvithstanding some diminution of exports is anticipated, we find its position " generally regarded as encouraging," while a " high state of prosperity" is plainly announced as the condition maintained throughout 1856. We turn, however, to a branch of industry more extensively and immnediately affected by the state of our relations with Russia-the linseed aud oil trade. Of the former article Russia usually supplied no less than three-fourths of the entire produce consumed, so that the opening or closing of her ports was a matter of the most vital importance. What actually happened in this market was natural enough. Russia's acceptanceof the peace proposals took traders by surprise; linseed was expected all at once to become a drug instead of a jewel, and down went prices from 76s. to 47s. But what followed? Seed was presently found scarce, the ehance of short crops from Russia was discerned, reaction commenced, and up went the market again, till the quotation, instead of 47s., became 66s. As a summary, "the losses," says the circular we are reviewing, "in the first six "months must have been most serious, but, "following on prosperous times, and succeeded by an unusually profitable working season up to "this date, the trade was probably never in a "healthier condition." In the case of oils, again, the report presents features exactly similar. No description of merchandise was more closely affected by the Russian war than this, and the year accordingly opened with the article at an exorbitant price. All this was at once upset by the peace, the value of oil rapidly sank, and holders of produce were involved in " ruinous " losses." Again, however, folows the salutary reaction almost at the moment. " But such a " state of things," continues the same line of the circular, "was not of long duration; our markets " rapidly recovered their wonted elasticity, and a " large and legitimate business at improving prices " has since been transacted in the face of liberal "supplies of many articles which war prices natu"rally stimulated." From merchandise we turn to shipping, a department of commerce on which the war operated with signal effect, and which, indeed, had been previously influenced to a great extent by the gold discoveries and their consequences. The rush of adventurers to Australia and the demands of the successful diggers gave a powerful impetus to the construction of ships-an impetus of course augmented by the prodigious requirements of the war. Not only were transports urgently needed, but commodities formerly supplied by Russia had to be fetched from India. The natural result was an enormous supply of tonnage, a large proportion of which was, of course, disengaged by the terminati.on of the war. In point of fact, steam freights dropped fiom 40s. per ton gross per month to 20s., and even at that rate were quoted almost nominally. It cannot be disguised, indeed, that the supply of shipping appears in excess, but even here encouragements are in prospect. Imports of grain and timber, it is observed, increased during the first 11 months of the past year, in the former case to the extent of 43, and in the latter to 37 per cent., above the rate maintained during the same period of 1855. Australian trade, again, opens favourable views. Guanol isin such demand that 50,000 tons of shipping have been taken up vWithin the last few weeks i. tha branch of commerce alone, and, as it is an il wind that blows nobody good, the Persian w¢a, -we are reminded, is likely to create a geod inquiry for transport vessels. From an.vte. circular we obtain further details as to, the actual sale of ships at Liverpool. Here a combination of low freights and an increased prke of money are spoken of, but ackoswleda enp is presently made of circumftauce" imparkg a different character to the resultA which would otherwise hare been apprehended.- These counterbalancing conditions are nothing leas than " the steady enlargemc7ii of the 5trade of the country, and of our port ir par"ticular ;" so that, upon the whole, the businers of this first year of peace has been " about as " satisfactory" as that of the last year of war. In one particular, however, we should like to see the anticipations of the slhipping trade curtailed. The number of vessels lost during the year 1855 on or near the coasts of the United Kingdom amounted, we are told, to no fewer than 1,141 sail, with an aggregate of 176,600 tons, and " there 5 is reason to believe" the destruction of the past year wiUl be " nearly if not quite equial" to that of the year preceding. Such a terrible state of things is surely neither inevitable nor endurable. We have now, we think, fulfilled our promise of placing before the reader facts wel descrving his attention; and, obNious as is the ground for gratulation, it is all the greater from the very nature of the prosperity recorded. WVe are not livingupon the fortuitous advantages of an exceptional and temporary condition of affairs, nor is the commerce of the country expanded to its present dimensions by the operation of any unhealthy or exhausting stimulus. The contrary rdther is the case, for we have passed from war prices to peace prices, have experienced the shock contingent on the transition, and have recovered and assured our balance by the best of aU aids, -that of natural andl inherent strength under legitimate conditions of trade.

TA VISTO CK-HO USE THEATRE. It would be absurd to apply the term " private " to the theatrical performances that tak-e place at Tavistock-house, the residence of Mr. Charles Dickens. The host, who is likewise the principal performer, is the most popular writer of the day; the audience comprise the higbest celebrities in law, literature, art, and fashion. The decorations of the stage Are produced partly by Mr. Stanfield, partly by Mr. Telbin. Nor are the talents of the actors chiefly dovoted to pieces that have already received the sanction of a paying audience. Mr. Dickens's company is bound to create, as wel as to imitate, and, though an old farce may terminate the evening's cntertainment, the staple work of each festivity is a drama that has not been nroduced elsewhere. Few plays brought out within the ast two years have obtained such a reputation in certain circles as the Lightwusc of Mr. Wilkie Colins, acted at Tavistockhouse only. Last night Mr. Dickens recommenced his theatrical season, which is to comprise four performances. The main tece, which is to last through them all, was a now work n Mr. Wilkie Collins, entitled the Proccn DJcp. The dramiads personcc were as follows:- Captian Eheworth, ot the Sea New .. Si. Edwanid Pigott. Captain 1elding, of the Wanderer .. M. Alfred DicCens. I.eutenaet Cr5yford . Mr. Mark Lon,on. Fra)k Aldersley..hir. Wilkie Collie,. R.ichard Wardour . Msi. Charles Dickens.

We may amend the above list by oxplaining that "' Mr. Young Charles" denotes Mr. Charles Dickens, jun., and that the ladies whose Christian names alone appear are members of Mr. Dickens'sfamily. The opening scene of the new drama was first exhibitod through a dense gauze, and during the semi-obscurity pro- duced by the *medium" a prologue in verse was delivered by the sonorous voico of Mr. John Forstor, who, himself celebrated for his histrionic talent, displayed of old in divers amateur performances, was on this occasion content to be hoard without being seen. The dispersing mists of gauze reveal a snug little interior in Devonshire, with a charming evening landscape in the background, painted by Mr. Telbin. Four of the ladies whose names appear in the programme Are regretting soein beloved personage absent on a Polar expedition. Mrs. Steventon is uneasy about a young husband, Miss Rose Ebsworth mourns for her father, Miss Lucy Crayford sighs for her brother, and Clara Burnham is more unhappy thAn all the other three put together. Frank Aldersley, to whom Clam is betrothed, and whom she reaUy loves, is'among the Arctic wanderers, and maytherefore account forher misery; butshe has an additional cause of wretchedness in the reflection that a youthful playmate, named Richard Wardour, who had always hoped to marry her, had returned from abroad to find her "engaged" to another, and had vowed vengeance in consequence. Clara Burnham has a kindly friend in Lucy Crayford, and a somewhat dangerous companion in Nurse Esther, an old Scotchwoman, who asserts that she has the gift of second sight and encourages the morbid humour of her young mistress by pretending to see what is going on at the North Pole. The second act takes place in a log hut erected in the Arctic regions, which, opening upon a snow landscape, reveals one of the most perfect picttres conceivable. In this hut we find all the four gentlemen for whom the ladies have been sighing, and also the disappointed Richard Wardour, who, however, little suspects that his favoured rival is so near him. About Richard Wardour there are differences of opinion. Most agree that he is a disagreeable sort of being, but Lieutenant Crayford, a fine, bluff, honest feUow (acted to perfection by Mr. Mark Lemon) fancies there may he some good in him after all. However, when Richard makes him his confidant, and shows the depth of his vindictive fecling against his unknown rival, his good opinion is a little shaken. A chain of evidence, needless to follow here, gradually proves to Richard Wardour that the porson ho has so long songht is Frank Aldersley, and, to the great horror of the worthy Lieutenant, he resolves to join Frank in an exploring expedition. The third act takes place in a marine cavern, on the coast of Newfoundland, opening upon the sea. This and the preceding scene are by Mr. Stanfield. The ladies have sought the objects of their divers affections, and all but Clara are made happy; for, while Steventon, Ebsworth, and rayford are s3fe and comely, nothing has been heard of Frank and Richard since they left the rest in each others company. That Richard has cut Frank's throat is the naturalhypothesis of wiorthy Crayford. Dinner time arrive6, and the party are preparig for their meal, when a haggard wretch rushes into the cave and demands food. Iis request is granted; part of the food he eats, part he thrusts into a wallet. The madness of his gestures renders him an object of general curiosity, till at last (rayford recognizes him as the lost Richard Wardour, and collars him as the supposed murderer of Frank Aldersley. The maniac, however, lbounds trom the spot with a wild shriek on observing Clara Burnham among the company, and presently returns, bearing Frank Aldersley in his arms. He has, indeed, been sorely tempted to commit murder, but his better nature prevailing, he has kept his rival alive, and his mision of Christian forgiveness being now accomplished he dies amiduniiversal blessings. To understand the faeU merit of this charming little piece, tho eircumstauces for which it is written must be taken fuUy into consideration. The story is properly compact, thescene ofaction is narrow, so thatthe plas represented need not be supposed larger than the autual stage of the small theatre. For3lr.CharlesDickensthero is aremarkably fine part in the man of strong passions, rendered stubborn and brutal by disappointment, but with enough of good in him to resist the tempter when his snares become snost formidable. The vacant madness of tho last act, the shriek of recognition on beholding Clara, are finely executed, and, perhaps, never was an audience more visiblymoved than tbat of last night by the expiring moments of the contrite "man of wrath." However, even in its minuteost details, the play is performed in a spirit of completeness that gives an ineffable charm to the whole. The ladies manage their pathos in the most natural style, the minor charcters are zealously played, and the moral tone of the work is sustained by the actors to a degree which is scarcely explicable to those who have not witnessed the perfonnanee. That tone is generaUy solemn, but it is relieved by the character of Jobn Want, a grumbling sea-cook, played with eonsiderable humour by | The farce of last aight w.afs Aniral MAedi.sm, but other ater-pCDies' will, be Ubstituted. on futue occasions, while

AIP THA CKE'RA I'S LECTURES. Yesterday evening Mr. Tbackeray delivered at the Mary. lebono Literary and Scientific Institution the second of his series of lectures on " Tho Four Georges." The Theatre of the institution was cro wded, and among the assembly wero many gentlemen of literary celebrity. MIr. THACKURAY, who was cordially applauded upon his entrance, said,-` We may commence our lectuwe this evening as a favonrite English novelist is in the habit of beginning some of his pleasant stories, by saying that some time in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1747, two horsomen might have been seen galloping along the roxd from Chelsea to Richmond. The foremost, cased in the jackboots of the period, vas a broad-faced, jolly-looking, and very corpulent cavalier, and by the manner in which he guided his horso you might at once perceive that he was a bold as well as a skUful rider; indeed, no man loved sport better, and in hunting the fields of Norfolk no squiro rode moro boldly after the fox, or cheered Ringwood and Sweetlips more lustily." On reaching Rvichmond-lodge this sturdy wayfarer asked to see the master, but tho women to whom he made this application assured him that it could not possibly be granted. The master was asleep, and woe botide the hun,Lu being who would dare to invade his slumsbes. This was a disheartening reception; but, notliDng daunted, our stout friend rushed into the house, and, overbearing all opposition, mado his way to the bedchamber wvhere the dapper little man who owned the dwelling was tranquilly sleeping. "I am Sir Robert Walpolc,"exclaimed. the intruder; " I have the honour to inform you that your august father died the other day at Konigsberg, and that your Majesty is King of England." " Dat is von big lie l' roared out his sacred majesty. Nevertheless, it was tbe truth. The reign of George IL had already couimenced, and continued for three-and-thirty years after that day. After dravwing a vivid portrait of Sir Robert Walpole, to whom, notwithstanding his unscrupulous and irreverent nature, he awarded the,praise of having saved us from the Stuarts, and given us peace, ease, and freedom, the lecturer proceeded to sketch the character of George IL, whom he described as a dull little rnan, of coarse manners and low tastes, who reserved his ssentimentalities for the Germans, and never condecended to be genial or familiar with the English. He knew nothing of literature or the fine arts, and his dismal experience of mankind had made him cynical. His only redeeming trait was his personal courage, of which he gavo abundant proof on various occasions, and more particularly at Dettinigen, when he flourished his sword in the face of the whole French army. In 1705 he married Caroline of Anspach, a woman remarkable for talent, learning, beauty, and good temper, and one of the best wives a king was ever blessed with. Mr. Thackeray having narrated the circumstances of the "Royal row," ashe, termed it, which resulted in the ejection from St. James's Palace of the Prince of Wales, his wife, and his children, sketched in graphio language the various distinguished visitors who frequented Richmond-lodge while George IL sojourned there, observing that, for his part, he was at a loss to find, among the rouged, lying, and fawning crowd, one whom he could truly love. The Queen. was a good woman, but she cared for no created being except her husband, and for him she woull have chopped her children into little pieces. The Court was utterly corrupt and profligate. Weread that Lady Yarmouth bet a clergyman 5,O000. that he should ba made a bishop ; the parson obtained his see and paid her ladyship the wager. In St. James's Chapel the ling wasyawning under his canopy and chattering German as loud as the preacher, one Dr. Young, who wrote poetryabout the stars, and, who on one occasion burst into tearsbecause the Defender of the Faith and dispenser of bishopriceswould not listen to him. What wonder that there sbould have been a Whitfield crying in the wilderness and a Wesley quitting the insulted temple to pray upon the mountain top? "Where," exclaimed the lecturer, "is the honest man or the pure person one may look at in that sordid court, where the air stifles us with Its sick-ly perfume? There are some old-world follies and some absurd: ceremonials about our Court of the present day which I laugh at; but, as an Englishman, contrasting the present with the past, shaU I not acknowledge with satisfaction thachange of to-day? (Cheers.) As the mistress of St. James's passes me now I salute the Sovereign-wise, moderate, exemplaryoflife-thegoodwife, thegoodmother, theaccomplished lady, the enlightened friend of art, the tender sympathizer in her people's sorrows and glories." (Cordial applause.> Having drawn a fascinating portrait of the famous Lady Suffolk, the moet briUiant woman of her day, to whom Lord Peterborough, " an indomitable youth of 70", made love, and whose charms have been immortalized by Pope anI Gay, the lecturer then glanced at the popular pastimes of the age, observing that England vas at that time a far merrier country than the island wo now inhabit. The people of all ranks and classes were fonder of xmusement, and what between drinking, dancing, dining, supping, and playing at all manner of games, the wonder was that statesmen got through their business at all The marks of the places where the balls used to roll were stil vsible in some parts of St. James's Park; but what a change had come over the aspect of society? Fancy Lord Pahnerston playing at "hockey " in St. James's Park: now-a-days, and Lord John Russell, with his coat off, giving. him back the baUsl! But in those by-gone times we were more gregarious and more easily amused than at present. After giving a briXliant licture of Beth as it appeared in, the days of Beau Na. , the lecturer adverted to the passion for cards wbich prevailed to such an extent in the reign of George II. that Bishops, and even Nonconformist clergymen, were constant frequenters of tho whist-table. Reverting then to the immediate subject: of his discourse, he observed that George l1. paid back the dislike for things German by a cordial contempt for everythinEnglish-even for English nobility, sports, and roast. beef. He kept continually running over to Germany. Ho went there in 1729S and remained away for two whole years. Yet hero in England he wasnot missed in the least. (A langh.) Aftoo the death of his wife, when more than 60 years of age, he might have been seen in his Hannverian Court, in masquerado guise, capering away like a Turk with Ladj Yarmouth. But he affected the deepest veneration for tha memory of kis wife, and ordered tlhAt when he wv-buried in the saino grave with her one side of her coffin should be. taken out that his ashes might mingle with those of his dearCaroline, of whom he declared during her lifetime that. there was no woman on earth worthy to tie her shoes! At length the fit came which choked the old man. On the25th October, 1760, his pa;o took his chocolate into his bedroom, and, behold, the King was dead on the floor.! The, same ceremonies had to be gone through as for his father. and parsons preached and Poets sang the virtues of the departed reprobate. One fanmous divine enumerated his. excellent qualities in verse, and, aftersumming up the good. he had done, concluded by declaring, in. effect, that the, pleasure ho must have derived from the wsarfermance of,so many noble actions must have been so ecsatic that " The next degree of happinmess washeaven L' (Laughter.) "If," observed the lecturer, "he hd- been. good, or just, or pure in life, or wise iaecouncil, Vh&tooulb post have said more of him? But ha had neither. digity,.

FOBRIGN INTELTIGBNCE. FRANCE. (FROM OU OWN COBIvszgPo1DXNT.1 PARIS, MONDAY, 6 P.M. There has been no conference held yesterday or to-day. Several interviews have taken place between the Plenipotentiaries individually and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Plenipotentiaries with each other. It is said that the French and English Governments have agreed to demand from China a satisfactory and ample treaty by which all countries wiU benefit, and which wiU enable them to have easy and regular communication with all parts of the Celestial Empire when necessary. The French oquadron is about to proceed to the Chinese seas. The probability of a pacific settlement of the Neuclrtel question continues the same. It is certain that the Federal Council have commuuicated to France and England iheir ultimatum-the utmost they will grant to the demands of Prussia. The ultimatum I believe to be in substance this:Previous liberation of the prisoners on the united demand or request of England and France, with the condition, however, that the two Governments shall previously engage to obtain from the King of Prussia the formal renunciation of his rights in the canton of Neuehbtel; or, rather, that they shal guarantee that renunciation. This, in fact, is the pith and marrow of the question. The mere assumption of the title of Prince of Neuchitel without any power may or may not flatter His Majesty's vanity; but the point is one on which I believe the Confederation will make no difficulty. The maintenance of a title, without the shadow of authority or right over the territory which gives it, would be just as unmeaning as that of King of France, which the Enalish sovereigns kept until the Peace of Amiens, or the lofty and sounding designation of King of Cyprus, Jerusalem, &c., which I believe are stiU among the titles of His Sardinian Majesty. The questions of the property belonging to the King or to Prussian subjects in NeuchAtel are also secondary points, and wiU be settled without difficulty. On the main point, namely, the liberation of the prisoners, andjthe guarantee of France and England, a communication has been made by the Federal Council to the English and French Governments. The answer from) London has not yet been received, but is every moment expected, It will then depend on the King of Prussia to end at once or prolong the present uncertainty. The folowing private telegraphic despatches have been received "BERNE, JTu,s. 4. "An ultimatum is expected from France and England. The new levy of troops is for 14,000. A rigorous service of survceance has been established on the frontiers. A proclamation from the Federal Councll is expected to be published very shortly." " BERXLIN, JAR. 4. " The Suabian Mfercury of the 4th announces that the Permanent Commission of the Chambers of Wurtemberg had declared unanimously, on the occasion of the demand made by the Deputies, in favour of a protest against the passage of the Prussian troops. The commission had, moreover, demanded a commnunication on the actual state of the negotiations on the subject. " The Assembly of Citizens had addressed a petition to the King, begging him to remove the danger which menaced the material interests of the country. "A letter from Munich states that M. Furrer had an interview with the President of the Council and the Mrinister for Foreign Affairs.' The Metropolitan Chapter met to-day, and is probably sitting at the hour I write, to deliberate on the drawing up of an address to the people of the archdiocess of Paris on the melancholy end of their metropolitan, and to appoint three vicars-general in the room of those whose funetions are necessarily brought to a close by the death of the prelate. The consternation produced by that unprecedented crime has not diminished; it pervades every rank, from the highest tQ the lowest. The assassin's name is, it appears, Verger, and not Verges, as stated at first. He is a man of average stature and rather thin. At the moment of the crime he wore a black coat and a black great-coat. His features are regular, he is closely shaved, and his forehead is high and free froni hair. Just before the blow was struck M. de Borres, Cur6 of St. Etienne-du-Mont, preceded the Archbishop, requesting the people to kneel down. He remarked on his right a man who remained standing, but who on a sign from him bent the knee also. The Archbishop having turned towards the left to give his blessing to the children this man suddenly rose, seized the prelate by the right hand so as to turn him partly round, and then plunged a poniard into his breast near the heart. The prelate staggered back two or three steps, and cried, "1 e malheureux m'a tue P" and he sank almost without sensation. The cur6 thinking that the Archbishop had been taken suddenly ill (for being in advance he had not seen the assassin give the stab), endeavoured to calm the congregation, and then turned towards the prelate, whom he found lying on the pavement unable to speak. The assassin attempted to strike a second blow with the knife, but was prevented by the Abbe Surat. It was one of the sergents de ville on duty in the church who first seized the assassin. It had been stated, and the statement was repeated in almost all the Paris journals, that Verger had made himself remarked for his opposition to the dogma of the " hnmaculate Conception ;" that the words he uttered when stabbing the Archbishop were " a bas la D&esse P" in allusion to that dogma and that he committed the crime, and exposed himself to certain death out of zeal agamist the new dogma. T have made inquiries in various quarters on the subject, and I am assured that Verger uttered no such exclamation on committing the crime; that he was not suspended from his functions for preaching or writing against the dogma; and that the repeated interdicts imposed on him were occasioned by misconduct, gross in any one, but particularly so in an ecclesiastic. B e was for six months the cross-bearer at the Chapel of the Tl'ileries, which belongs to the parish of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and for some time before his removal had exposed himself to censure. Various anonymous lettes had, it seems, been received by the Archbishop, in which the most scandalous charges were made against his superiors. After much inquiry these denunciations were traced to Verger. In a case of poisoning, which was tried some tine since, and in which the husband was the criminal and the wife the victim, Verger was examined as a witness. In the course of the trial he addressed the Court in a violent manner in favour of the accused. He was censured by the judges, and subsequently by his ecclesiastical superiors. Shortly afterwards he published a pamphlet against the Procureur Imperial, in which he lavished on him the greatest vituperation. For these reasons, as well as for his repeated irregularity of morals, he was suspended by his diocesan the Bishop of Meaux. Verger appealed to the metropolitan, the Archbishop of Paris, who has the power of removing the punishment inflicted by the suffragan. The Archbishop required that all the proofs and documents on which the Bishop of Meaux founded his censure should be laid before him. They were submitted and examined with the greatest care and deliberation. The result was that the Archbishop, in the mildest terms, informed Verger that, with such evidence, he could not relieve him from the censure of the Bishop of Meaux. He at the same time treated him with much kindness. He entreated him to be cautious of giving scandal, to amend his life, to avoid in future the errors which had brouaht down punishment on him; and he hinted that the restoration of his functions would depend or. his own conduct in future. In the meantime the Archbishop gave him 300f. to provide for his present necessities, and informed him that he should do all in his power to save hinfrom falling into destitution. The Archbishop on subsequent occasions relieved his wants; but still deelined, from conscientious motives, to remove his suspension. It is said that Verger very lately wrote letters inwhichhe acknowledged the kindness and charity of the Archbishop, while at the same time, according to his own declaration, he was preparng for the crime he has just comniitted Whatever reasons he may now allege for his conduct, I am assured that his suspension was simply owing to the iregularity of his life. The Univers would imply that Verger is insane. It is true that sno man capable of such a deed, on such a spot, and under such circmustances, can be pronounced in a Perfectly healthy state of mind. But it may be doubted whether he is more of a madman than the gerrty of atrocious criminals The answers given by himi in his pre- liminary exan :atioa do not isxdicat -Tnuch derangemnent of intellect. IIe ADI*" .ol, clear, and recfltte. As I have already o emdj hisprevious conduct gives evidence of a perverse, ill-conditioned mind. I have not as yet learned that proofs* are alleged of his being a man who is irresponsible lor his acts. The body of the archbishop was embalmed yesterday. It will be laid out in state to-morrow, and will remain so till Saturday. The publi will be admitted to view it every day from 10 to 4. No day, I believe, is yet fixed for the interment. The Papal Nuncio, immediately on hearing of the assassination, went about 6 o'clock on Saturday evening to the residence of the cure of St. Etiennedn-Mont, where the archbishop's body lay. The Nuncio was much affected at beholding the inanimate remains of one whom he had only seen two days before, at the Palace of the Tuileries, in full possession of health and faculties, and for whom he felt so great an esteem. The Patrie states, that- " The assassin Verger passed several hours in the church of St. Etienne-dn-Mont the day he committed the murder, to choose a place where he might strike his victim most securely. His first intention was to stab the Archbishop when seated on his pontifical throne. For this purpose he offered the beadle money to allow him to take his seat during the sermon near the staUs occupied by the clergy, and which place, he said, he occupied every year during the ceremonies. The beadle refused. Verger then thought of a bench whence he might strike the Archbishop in a narrow passage. The prelate passed close to the assasain on his entrance. Verger waited for his going out, but the Archbishop went out by another door, and Verger was again disappointed. It was then he went to the nave, where he accomplished his fearful project." A private letter from Madrid of the 29th ult. says:- " The remarks in Tih Times of the 23d on the state of Spain have produced a great and general sensation in political circles here. The Madrid papers that ventured to publish one or two paragraphs of that article were seized by the authorities; but they could not prevent the publio from becoming acquainted with the article, which circulated everywhere. Several received copies in manuscript, *nd to each sheet were appended these words, ' Be pleased to make a copy, and send it round.' As public opinion is so impressed with the truth and value of that true description of our situation, as our own press is completely gagged, and as we now only look to the independent and courageous press of England to let Europe know in what conditon we are, no one who received a copy in manuscript neglected to comply with the notioe. For these reasons, in spite of the police, the article was as well known here as if it had appeared in print, and it was, moreover, read with aU the interest which mystery imparts, and which gives additional zest and importance to it." A letter from Constantinople of the 22d ult., in the Cournier of Marseilles, says:- "A.though England has declared war against Persia, Lord Stratford de Radcliffe went yesterday to pay a visit to Ferak Khan. This step on the part of the British Ambassador has caused great astonishment, for it is known that negotiations were definitively broken off. His Lordship has employed aU his efforts to prevent, or at least delay the departure of Feruk Khan to Paris. At the beginning he treated the matter with a high hand, but afterwards became milder, and at last did not disdain to go in person to the Persian Legation. It is evident that he did not expect the resistance which he has met with from a Power which he esteemed so lightly." The last has been a profitable week for the shopkeepers of Paris. It is calculated that their sales have exceeded those of last year. Some who had prudently limited their stock of goods, fearing a bad season, are completely run out. The manufacturers wvho have more particularly profited by the jLncr de I'an are the dcealers in bronze, jewelry, and woollen stuffs. It appears that the stock of goods among the manufacturers and shopkeepers was rarely so low as at the presont moment. Should trade continue to revive there is no doubt but that the operatives employed in the manufactories will have full occupation for the entire year. The payments usual at the end of the year have been made with great punctuality. There were but few commercial bills protested on the 31st of December. Much anxiety was experienced in the commercial world for that period, and it is admitted that the caution observed by the Bank of France tended in a great measure to prevent a financial crisis. The Christmas holydays have produced a certain stagnation in the manufacturing towns of Normnandy and Alsace. *5Woollen and cotton cloths are, however, still looking up, in consequence of the low stock on hand, and likewise on account of the high price of the raw material. Business has been brisk in Lyons since the fall in the price of raw silk. The price of wvheat continues to fallconstantly and gradually. The speculators for a rise, who held firm so long, are nowv forced to make concessions, and even to seU both wheat and flour at a loss. A farther reduction in the price of bread has taken place in Paris. It is expected that this fall in prices will continue. The very best quality of flour was offered in the Paris markets at 79f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes, and many purchases of good quality were made at from 68f. to 78f. The reserve in the flour stores is increasing, and may be estimated at present at 12,000 metrical quintals. Vheat broug,ht the same price at the last Paris market as at the preceding mlarket. Good white wheat from the North was offered at from 43f. to 44f. 50c. Wheatof good quality from the Beauce at from 42f. to 43f., and ordinary at from 40f. to 41f. There were some purchasers from Dijon, but they refused to give the prices (~emanded. Prices are low, and would be lower at Iarseilles but for the demand from Spain. There arrived in the port of Marseilles during the last eight clays 62,000 hectolitres of wheat, 14,000 hectolitres of rye, and 10,000 hectolitres of maize. A certain degree of firmness has been observed in the corn-markets in the departments, caused by the snow which has fallen rendering the roads impassable. The farmers were consequently iunable to bring their produce to market. A sudden rise of 2f. the hectolite has taken place in the principal markets of Brittany, where prices had been lower than in any other part of France. There was a slight rise in the cattle-market of Paris last week, in consequence of an insufficient supply. It is said that the Govermnent contemplates supplying the inhabitants of Paris with fresh mleatpreserved according to the new method, for which a patent has been obtained. Sue*ja proceeding would effect a complete revolution in the butchers' trade. The price of good wine is well maintained at Bercy. The greater portion of the last crop of Bordeaux wine has been sold at the following prices Laiitte, at 5,700f. the tun; Mlonton, 5,000f.; La Lagune, 3,000f. ; Lagrange, 3,000f.; Laroze, 4,000f.; Cos d'Estourmel, 3,700f.; Cos Lahorey, 2,000f. Inferior wines are not saleable at Bordeaux. There is but little doing in spirits of wine. Spirit dlistilled from beetroot had fallen to 125f. the hectolitre, but has again risen to 130f.

SWITZERLAND, The Sitisse of Bemne gives the following description of the enthusiasm which exists throughout the Swiss Confederation .- "The central comumitteo of the Swiss Society of Car. bineers has addressed an appeal to various rifle clubs in the country, recommending all citizens who do not form part of the Federal army to come forward as volunteers, and to place their persons and property at the disposal of the country. The most satisfactory acnounts have been received from northern Switzerland as to the feelings of the frontier populations. The reception given to the Federal troops proves ttiht the greatest confidenee is there felt in our cause. The Federal Colonel Delarageaz to busaly oocupied with the for- tifications of Bade. Re is asisted by Captain de Valiere, ex.offloerof the.AsW-SwIx is*on,, who took part in the French e xpeditfon aoinst tiq Ktbylie i i4 1852. The bur. geEsac of Bienne have voted an unlimited credit for assisting the families of such of the citizens aare obliged to enter the army. At Berthoud a society has been formed for supplying uniforms aRd clothing to such of the citizens as cannot afford the expense and also for assisting their families. The military department of the canton of Schwytz has made a successful appeal to the inhabitants to procure worsted stockinrs for the soldiers. The communes on the borders of the lake in the canton of Thurgau are organizing ivic guards. Colonel Bundi, of the Grisons, has offered his services to the Govern. inent. Companies of volunteers are being formed in thi Grisons, who will be armed with heavy rnaces, such as were used by the ancient Swiss. Mountain batteries, placed on mules, are al ready for use at the first cal. The manicipality of Lucens has granted an indemnity of lOf. to each of its citizens who may be caled out to serve. The commune of CorceDles has adopted a similar measure, and it is thought that others will foUow the example. An addre3s has been sent to the Federal Assembly by the central committee of the Association of Vaud. This society, which was formed in consequence of the conflict that arose on the question of the Western Railway, has offered its co-operation to the Federal authorities. Letters from Moudon, Vevey, and Yverdun state that the enthusiasm of the inhabitants goes on increasing. The spirit which animates the entire canton of Vaud is exclusively national, and free from any ideas of revolutionary propagandism. Conservatives and Radicals all unite in the common cause, desiring the complete independence of Neuch&tel and the maintenance of the honour of Switzerland. The sub-officers of the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion in Algeria have sent an address to the Federal Council in the name of all the Swiss soldiers in the said legion, requesting it to obtain permission from the French Government for them to return home and co-operate in the defence of the country."
MILITARY AND NA VAL INTBLLIGE.NCE. Yesterday morning a board of officers consisting of Colone, E. A. Parker, second in command of the Chatham divisioa of Royal Marines; Lieutenant-Colonel E. Rea, Roya Marines; and Major W. Radcliff, in command of the depo of the 84th Regiment, assembled at the military prison, Fort Clarence, Chatham, for the purpose of making an inspection of that establishment. The board was assisted by Captain R. Manners, the governor of the establishment, an i the result of the inspection was very satisfactory. In consequence of the large number of troops who were required in the Crimea during the late war the authorities at the War-office were unable to complete the regimenti serving in India to their proper establishment, but the Duke of Cambridge has now given directions for the whole of the regiments on the Indian establishment to be raised to their war strength as early as possible. With this view volunteering has been commenced from all those regiments on the home station which are above the prescribed establish. ment, and recruiting is also proceeding vigorously, it being the intention of the authorities to have the Indian regiments completed before the season for tbe embarcation of draughts from this country arrives, Upwards of 600 volun. teers have arrived at the Provisional Battalion, Chathamu, for the purpose of joining the various Indian depots of that garrison, the whole of whom will undergo a course of in struction in the use of the Enfield rifle. Her Majesty's steam sloop Hermes, 6, Commander Gardon, embarked a party of Royal Marine Artillery yesterd y morning at Portsmouth, and left Spithead in the afternom for the Cape of Good Hope. The Primrose, 2, steam gunboat arrived at Portsmouth yesterday afternoon from the eastward to be laid up. The A-on steamvessel, Master-Commander Palmer, lelt Portsmouth yesterday afternoon for Plymouth with supernumeraries. The Stromboli, 6, steam sloop, Commander Burgess, wi'l be paid off this day at Portsmouth. Her Majesty's steam blockship Pembroke, 60, Captain Fraser, will be " paid down" or " advance" this day at Portsmouth, after which she will proceed for Leith Roads on Coastguard service. The iron steam troopship Megsera, 6, Commander Purvis, is getting on very fastin her rigging and outfit at Portsmouth. She has her topmasts pointed and topmast rigging over the rnastheads. The Simoom, 1S, iron steam troopship, Commander Cooke, is taking in provisions and stores at I-ortsmouth for foreign service. All the mortar vessels moored off Hardway (Gosport shore) have been shifted out into Portsmouth harbour stream on account of their swinging foul of the ships of the line and others moored in ordinary when the wind is from the westward. The wind having shifted round to the I.E, on Monday and yesterday, the whole of the outward bound at the Motherbank, Spithead, and St. Helen's got away, with the exception of the Anerican ship Zurich, detained at the Motherbank by a refractory crew. The Spirit of the Age, from London for China, arrived off Portsmouth yesterday with loss of anchors, chains, &c. (slipped from in the Downs). She was immediately sapplied by Messrs. Garratt, Gibbon, and Sons, agents to oyd's, at Portsmouth. The gunboats Pheasant, Master-Commander Henry W. Allen, and the Pickle, in pilot charge of Mr. Stewart, Queen's pilot of Woolwich, arrived at Sheerness on Monday evening, having put back from Margate Roads from stress of weather, while bound from Woolwich for Portsmouththe Pickle with the loss of one anchor and chain cable. The gunboat Prompt was left riding in Margate Roads when the Pheasant and Pickle put back. The weather has bean excessively boisterous, with the wind from north-east to east, vith heavy snowstorms.

NfATURALIZATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You will greatly oblige me by inserting the foUowing letter in your columns on a subject which is of so much interest to foreigners resident in the British dominions. I am sorry that the opinion which I expressed in my letter of the 27th of December, which the circular from the Home-office led me to form, has been gainsaid in a letter from the Secretary of State, in reply to your corresnondent's inquiries on the subject, on his receiving a similar circular, which letter was inserted in lie Times of the 31st of December, which states that "the effect of a certificate of naturalization does not extend to investing the alien teo rvnwhomite is grantted wvith the character of an English subject i te onre. If such be the case, I myself cannot comprehend why in the circular from the Home-office this parenthetical proviso should have been added,-viz., " that no certificate or other act of naturalization granted by the British Government to an alien places him beyond the lawful power and control of his native country, unless he has received from the Govern. ment of such country.a certificate of denationalization, or been released from his original obligations s asubject or citizen in some other legal way." This pl4inly infers that if an alien does possess this certiCate of denationalization he is Placed beyond the lawful power of that country from which he emigrated; and consequently, being a naturalized British subject, has the right to claim protection at home as vell as abroad; or why, in the name of common sense, was the proviso added at all But there is a point to which I would call the attention of your last correspondent on the subject,-viz., that the certifcate of naturalization grants a passport to the naturalized British subject to enable him to travel in foreign part. Now I hol in my hand an English passPOrt, in whiXh the Earl of Clarendon, in the name of Her MIjesty, " requests and requiresall those whom it may concern to allow the naturalvied British subject to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford him every assistance and protection of which he may stand in need." Now, surely, if the above words mean anything, they mean that if I should wish to travel on the continent I can obtain a passport, which will not only enable me to travel in all foreign parts, but will also claim protection, in case of need, from the English Ambassadors or Consuls resident in those countrics through which I may pass. Therefore it would appear that protection is afforded to naturalized British subjects; but perhaps the Home-office has in store a fresh interpretation on the subject, aud, if so, I should like to know it, or I think we had better memorialize Sir George Grey, and know the truth of the case. Apologizing for again troubling you, I remain, Sir, your obedient. humble servant F. F. MAZUCHELLT. rurbroOk-honse% Cosham, kiants, Jan. b.
FATAL ACCIDE'T ON =E SoyT-WES nx RATLNVAY.-Yestorda3 Mr. Carter concluded an uljourned inquiry at the Railway Tavern, Kingston, respecting the death of Georgo Watton. It appeared from the evidence of an engine-driver nemed Porter that he was in charge of a passnger train which left Waterloo station at 10.45 on i t ome obstruction was found on the line at the Kingston caitting, near the Maldou station, and a rter who proceeded to the spot found the body of the deceased lying on the permanent way, near the woodEn bridge. After a long inquiry the jury found the foUowing verdict :-'- That the deceased was accidentally kill ed by a railwaytrain passing over him from fallingthrough the bridge, and there is every reasox to believe he was a,sbled from a fall from the said bridge, which is so oonstrcted and insecure that any person slipping or tripping upon it wou'd probably fall into the cutting; and the jurors recoMmerd the widow and children of the deceased to the kindest cot. sideration of the railway company; and the jury also extress their opinion that no blame whatever is attached t
THE PUBLIC HEALTH. The following is the quarterly supplement to the weekly returns of births and deaths in London:- The number of deaths registered in London during the quarter was 14,118. On comparing this result with tha numbers returned in the last quarters of 1852-55, and taking the growth of the population into account, it wiU te seen that the public health was tolerably good; and, as regards children, the reduction of mortality from some of those diseases which waste infant life appears to show that it was rather better than usual. But the comparison now made shows only an improvement which may be temporary, not that superior aid permanent condition of health which only measures that promote the moral and physical wellbeing of a populous community can effect. The deats from zymotic diseases in the quarter were altogether 2,902, being little more than a fifth part of tho total number. 74 persons died of smallpox; the nuwbers in the two previous corresponding quarters were 289 and 177. Scarlatina was fatal in 1,297 cases in the last three months of 1854; in the same period of 1855 it was fatal in 774 cases; last quarter the number was 556. Measles was rather prevalent in the quarter, and carried off 372 children. The number of persons who died of typhus and common feverwas 611, ,which is less than usual in the autumn months. Of these cases 194 occurred in the east division-Shoreditch, Bethnal-green, Mile-end, &c. Although the east division contains a much less population than the south, the deaths from fever were considerably more in the former than in the latter. But the deaths from measles on the south side of the river were 102, being double the number that occurred in the east districts, which appear to have enjoyed also greater exemption from smallpox than the other parts of London. The mortality from diarrhoea was not great ; this complaint was fatal in 316 cases, and was not, apparently, more common in one partithan another. Phthisis carried off 1,785 persons in the quarter; bronchitis, 1,432; pneumonia, 1,179; asthma, 174. Pulmonary diseases were more fatal than in the same quarter of 1855, and this was due, at least, in part, to those rapid atmos. pheric transitions which marked the beginning of December. In six weeks of the quarter the mean temperature was above the average; in seven below it. In one week it fell to 35°, and in the next it rose to 51°, and by the end of the year the mean weekly temperature was again 35'. Of the 14,118.deaths, 2,285, or about a sixth part, oc. curred in 117 public institutions-namely, 1,271 in work. houses, 20 in prisons, 65 in military and naval asylums, 72 in lunatic asylutns, 17 in hospitals for foreigners, 58 in miitsry and naval hospitals,!and 782 in general andlspecial hospitals forthe sick. (From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.) In the week that ended on Saturday the deaths of 1,497 persons-viz., 761 males and 736 females, were registered in London. In the first week of the year, during the period 1847-56, the average number of deaths was 1,321, and it this is raised in proportion to increase of population, for comparison with the number in the present return, it becomes1,453. The deaths now recorded exhibit an excess of 44 over the corrected average, The number of deaths registered last week is augmented to a very considerable extent by deaths in reference to which inquests had been held having been entered in the regiAter.. books in more than their just weekly proportion. Many of such cases were not registered till the end of the quarter, though they had occurred and been investigated by the coro. ner at earlier dates. For 25 deaths were referred last week to burns and scalds, 16 to hanging and suffocation, 29 to drowning, 48 to fractures, 7 to wounds 45 deaths were re. turned of persons "found dead," or who died suddenly from an unknown or unstated caule. UJnder these heads and a few others the excess will chiefly be found. Whooping-cough appears to have been more fatal last week than any other disease in the zymotic class; 51 children died of it. Measles was fatal in 38 cases, typhus and common fever in 37, scarlatina in 29, smallpox in 5. Measles prevails chiefly in the North districts, Marylebone, Camdentown, Islington. Six children died of it in the sub-district of Ishngton West. A family is mentioned by the registrar of Hackney-road, in which four children have been attacked by scarlatina maligna, and two have died. A seaman died on the 20th of December, from " want of sufficient nourishment," and a widow on the 28th, " apparently from destitution." The deaths of eight persons were registered last week who had attained the age of 90 years or upwards. A man who had been a butler was the oldest, and died at the age of 94 years. Last week the births of 1,025 boys and 948 girls,-in all 1,973 children,-were registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1598. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29746 in. The mean daily reading was above 30 in. on Tuesday and Wednesday. The highest reading was 3013 in., on Wednesday, and the lowest 28-97 in., on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 40 6', which is 3-7' above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean temperature was 11-3' below the average on Sunday, and was as much above it on Thursday. The lowest temperature on Sunday was 38.50, and on the foUowing Thursday it was 44 5. The highest temperature occurred on Friday, and was 52 -7, and the range of the week was 312°. The mean dew-point temperature was 37-1°, and the difference between this and the mean air tempeature w as 35°. Themesan temperature of the water of the Thames was 39'. The temperature of the river ranged from 36-9 to 41-5'. The direct-on of the vind was generally west-south-west. The horizontal movement of the air on Saturday was 410 miles. A very heavy gale of wind blewv on the evening of that day, accompanied with frequent showers, Between 7 and 10 o'clock P-in. the pressure of wind on the square foot varied from 1011 to 121b. The amount of rain i the week was 0-23 in., which fell on three days.
2THE SOUTH COAST OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-I have been staying here dtring the last five weeks, and three shipwrecks have oceurred at the foot of this cliff in that short period. A month a to two French vessels were driven ashore during the night, and soon went to pieces from the violence of the waves, the crews being saved y means of Manby's apparatus, with the exception of a man and boy, who were washed overboard and drowned. Durng Saturday, the 3d inst., a heavy gale was blowing from the west, and there was a very rough sea. Throughout the night it was very stormy. ELarly yesterday morning I was told by my neighbour, the coastguard officer here, to look out for a dismasted vessel that was afloat off Atherfield, andh would, in the course of a few hours, probably rt on the rocks eastward of Chale. With this information I was left, with my family, to discover the object of n.mmetv, and, by the aid of a good glass, I soon saw the nnfortateshiprollingpowerless inaseathatwaswhitenedwit breakers, its bulwarks washed away, its deckdeluged byevery recurring wave which poured over the side, every vestige of mast and rigging gone, andthe hulkitself disppearing from timetotime in thetrough oftherollingwaters, or staggering on the surface, water-logged, as it appeared to a landsman's eye, and about to founder. There were a few men visible on the more sheltered parts of the deck, and a boat with four or five sailors in her floated at the stern. The shore here is shallow, and becomes suddenly deep, forming a natural breakwater, against which a tremendous surf beats in stormy weather. The lookers on at this painful scene assured me that no boat could put off, that there was no lifeboat on the coast, and no means of telegraphic communication witb Cowes for s steamer to come off to the rescue. Vessels passed to and fro at a distance unobserved of this black speckupon the waters, and tantalizing one with vain hope of help. About 11 o'clock I saw something rise from the deck of the ship which I supposed was a signal of distress. Presently a second small jurymast rose and two sails spread before the wind, and the vessel, whicL had been anchored, began to move heavily eastward, with the boat in her wake. I went immediately to the house of myfriend who had given me informatinn of the disaster, and found him at his post with his men and rocket apparatus, ready to throw a rope to the vessel, if driven, as was not unlikely, on the shore near St. Catherine's Lighthouse. Wbat, however, delighted mie to hear was that Lieutenant Young, R.N., commander of the Coastgnard at the Atherfield station, had launched his boat at daylight, and boarded the vessel with his men, after two h.,urs of hard toil and imminent personal risk. We watched the ship just able to clear the rough water off the point called R",cken-end, and when this was accomplished she was considered safe. At about 3 o'clock a screw-steamer passed which had been telegraphed for from Yarmouth to Coves, and wbich probably towed the wreck into Portsmouth before night. The reason for my offering this communication is tosgoat that a good lifeboat is a desideratum here, and to as wlether a semaphore on St. Catherine's Downs might not aid in communicating with the north of the island. The means for preventing loss of life at this season seem to be inadequate to the danger of the coast. I am. kc.- ALFRED GATTY. Uflale, Isle of Wright, Jan. 5. -

AMPROPOLUTAZ' BOARD OP WORKS. A special meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Work,s was he d yesterday, in the Council-chamber, Gnildhall, on e requintion of five members, to consider the propriety of rescinding the regolatior; of the Board, which had rejected the memorial of the vestry of St. George, Hanover-square, respectingthe sitfetohf offices, ud also, on the requisition of seve memers f th Boad tore-cnsier aLnd rescind ocrtane other resolutions, in respect to the practicability of obtaininhg amore suitable site for such offices, Mr. Thwaites SIT. OF OFFCES. The folowing resolution, presented on the 5th of December last, from the vestry of St. George, Hanover-square, was read :- "Reslved unanimously, on the prepostion of Sir j. V. Shelley, seconded by Mr. Charles Westetn, that this vestry desir to expreas its strOng opinjOe against any oDutlay of money by the iethopolitan Boalrd of Works in the pnchbagng of land in the city of London Or elsewhere, for the Purpose of building offices &e., for the rmeetings of the aid Board, this vestry being of.opinion that the freebold bousa and the land in Greek-streetk now belonging to the MetropolitanBoard of Works are amply suiffcient for that purDose." Major LYO2;, in moving that the resolution passed by the Boa on the 5th of December, refusing to receive therecorded opinion of the vestry of St. George, Hanover-square that it was inexpedient that the Board should incur auy expense in the erection of any now building on another site or the use of the Board, be rescinded, observed that it was a constitutional right possessed by all the metropolitan district boards that they should approach the central Board by way ofsuggestion orremonstrance on any and every neasure that came under their consideration, and it was his opinion that the Board would be taking a most unwise and dangerous course if they were upon slight grounds to reject the representations of their constituents.Heregardeditasan insult to so inmportant a body as that of the vestry of St George, Hanover-square, that the respectful intimation of their opinion on a question which affected the whole body of ratepayers should have been set aside on such unsubstantial grounds as those which had boon urged; and if the Board perssted insuch course nt might seriously imperil its own existence, for the very object for which it had been created by the Legislature was to illustrate and give prac. tical effect to the prncple of local self-governsnent. He therefore moved that the resolution come to on the 5th of December, namely-" That the letter nd resolution from th vestry of St. George, Hanoversquare, respecting the site o. offices, drted December 2, be not received," be rescinded, Mr. SriLEV seconded the motion. Mr. RASHLEIIG supported it. MIr. H. L. TAYLOR opposed the motion, and said that if the Board were to allow the vestri's and district boards to dictate to them the course they should foUow on all questions that came before them they would bo abdicating their functions as an independent body, and suffering themselves to be converted into mere delegates. Milr. BxkvAv and Mr. Sxow opposed the motion on similar grounds. Mr. DouLToN supported the motion, aid contended that in receiving the memorials and representations of their constituents the Board would be in nowise compromised; but that it would be perfectly competent for them, notwithstanding, to maintain their independent character as a representative and deliberative body. Mr. HAWEES also supported the motion. After a few words from Mr. Deputy HA.nIsOx against the motion, The Board divided, when the motion was carried by a majority of 9; 16 voting for it, and 7 against it. On the motion of Major LYON, seconded by Mr. SEELEY, it was resolved " That the said letter and resolution from the vestry of St. George, Hanover-equarc, be received." The following requisition was then read We, ths undersigned rmemben of the said Board, finding that by certain resolutions or acts of the Board, made or done on the 19th of Sarsh and on the 6th of June Iast, it is rendered difficult for the Board to take ny measurs for altering or adapting the premies. in Greek-street to the present wants of the Board; and that by a resolution adopted on the 25th of November it is rendered difficult for the Board to acunire the site necommonded by the 8ite Committee, and that thus the Proper accommodation of the Board and its oioers is hindered and delayed, do hereby request that you will call a special meeting of the Board, to be held on the 6th day of January next, at half-past 12 o'clock, in Gulidhall, in order to the reconideration of those resolutions, aud that some one or more of them may be revoked or altered to such manner as may render it practicable to provide, wvithot further delay, for the future accommodation of the Board and "Bc B. SEELEY. "W. X SNOW. WIWLLIAM CO&R?MIAXL . WI. LYON. ALF. R. BRISTOW. ~ JOHLN'WARP., "W. H.DALTON. The CHAnR.ItIA then called on Mr. Seeley to move the reconsideration and rescinding of the following resolution of the Board, passed on the 19th of March, viz. :- " Thatitbeaninstrsction to the committeeto suspendtbe poption of any definite plan for the enlwgement of the house in Greek-street until It has ascertained whetber it may not be practicable to obtain a site in some more accessible situation. Mr. SEELEY said he was not prepare to make any such motion. It was true he had signed the requisition, but he expected that some other member would have taken up the subject. The CIIAIRfM,NAS.-Unless some member does take up the question, there is no business before the Board, this being tho subject for the consideration of which it had been specially convened. MIr. BrDGOOD remarked that hon. members must be cautious how they proceeded, otherwise they might be playing into the hands of those who wished to run them into an expense of 4001. a-year for groundrent, and of 50,0001. for a building in Farringdon-street. After some discussion as to the mode of proceedin Mr. WILKINSON said he was prepared to move that the resolution of March 19 should be rescinded. The committee xdad every opportunity of making inquiry and had failed in recommending a suitable site; he thought, therefore, by rescinding the resolution, it would throw; the Board back upon the oig,inal resolution in favour of Greek-stroet. He accordinglymoved that the resolution of the Board of march 19 be rescinded. Mr. WARE secondedthe motion, because he did not think it would necessarily compel the Board to adopt Greek-street as a site. AMajor LYOx supported the motion. MIr. SFF.LEY wished it were possible that members could expunge from their memory all that had passed upon the su ject, and then he believed there would be no difficulty in obtaining their assent to a resolution in favour of a more convement and central positior. than Greek-street. Greekstreet was not a central position; nine members of the Board lived westward of it, and -30 lived eastward, while the remaining five or six members livod on the north and south. Tower-hill was more central than Greek-street. Again, how did Greek-street stand in reference to the population ? The whole population of the metropli was 2,365,124. Of these the parishes north and south (which were not much affected by the position of the offices) contained 382,000; the parishes on the west 494,000, while the parishes in the east contained 1,4R8,000. The premises in Greek-street were inadequate to their prerent requirements. How much more so would they be uhen once the Boxrd entered upon the execution of their great works ! He denied that a building upon a now bitecwould cost 50,0001. lfe had no doubt whatever that the expenditure could be kept within 20.0001., while he was certain they could not retain the house in Greek-street at a less expense than 10,000?. Mr. n iows said bis constituents in Shoroditch were quite uilling to memorialize in favour of retaining offices in :reek-street; and as to the personal convenience of the members, that ought to be the last consideration to guide their judgment. Mr. SAYACGE opposed the motion, on the ground that the committee had not yet exhaulsted their means of ascertaining whether a more convenient site might not be obtained. Mr. D'IFFAN.-GEr said no member meant to contend that GreeL-street ws a central situation, but he was quite certain the whole body of ratepayers, whether west or east would condemn the Board if it consented to erect a building on any ground except its own. The Board would soon possess ground in Covent-garden and also in Southwark and probably one or the other of those localities might afford them a suitable site. Let them, then, have a temporary building, and wait till it could be ascertained whether some such position might not be obtained. He believed a temporary room might be erected at an expense considerably less than 2.00,01. After some further discussion the motion was put and negatitved by a majority of 1, there being 15 for it and 16 It was then proposed to rescind the resolttion passed on the 6th of June, which negatived the following motion:- *- That that artof the reportwcbi relates to the erectuon ofa temrs board-room atGreelkret be adoptod and forthwith carrioa out." But the CRhAIR3INs held that it was a motion which could not be put. There then remained on the paper the following resolntion, passed on the 25th of November, the rescinding of ,which was proposed by the requisitionists, viz:- - That inasmuch as the prOpoesa to tate a portion of the sate of the former Fleet Prison for official premises would involve an outay of many thousandpounds, and as the Board is now engaged in improvements which wll impose a very heavy taxation on the metropols It wouldbe inexpedient at the present time to incur nchb an expcnditure of the public money, and that therefore the report (of the Conn ittee on Sites) be not adopted." The ClHAIRMFANs caoled on Mr. Seeley to proceed. Mr. SF.LEY.-What is the object of our going on 7 The other mnotions have been rejected, and I therefore move that the Board do adjourn. 31r. SAVAGE seconded the motion. On a show of hands the numbers were equal, there being 12 for and 12 against the motion; and The CIIAIRMIAN decided in favour of proceeding with the business before the Board. Mr. HR XScFs then rose and said that, although it was his intention t, oppose the rescinding of the resolution of the 25th of November, yet, as the hon. member who had called the Board together declined bringing forward his own motion for that purposee, he (Mr. Hawkes) would himself do so, and thereby give to the Board the opportunity of aflirming their former resolution and of again determining that they woufld s,ot go into the city, or give their sanction to so intolerable a waste of the public money as had been pro- iosed. He hated the very precincts of the city. (Laughter.) They ought not to be placed in a state of pupilage, bat shouild show that they were a superior and not an inferior bedy of men. Mr. DEN-NIS was sorry to be obliged to second a motion which he e1lso intended to oppose- but he did not approve of gentlemen calline them speciaDy together and then to sit like statues and say nothing. Major LYnO explained that he bad signed the requisition at the desire * f Mr. Seeley, without intending to make him-elf responsible for the pr.position to be submnitted to the Board; and le th.,ught it woet improper and unfair that Mr. Seeley should have called the "'embers together, and then refuse to do anything. That gentleman oueht to stand up and state why he h d taken that course. Mlr. SEEXLY Paid his aniswer was tobe founjd in the worde ef the reqnisition. Mfr. 1. L. TAYLuII Baid he held Major Lyon responsible for calling the special board, as it was his duty, before he 1signed the requisition, to be certain that it was for sone przetscal objlect. Hr. WRGonT tbought tho real object of lr. Seeley was merely to cast about him and see what he could gain. There had been too much generalship in connexion with this matter altogether. (Hear, hear.) With regard to Greekstreet, the buildin;, was not large enough; but the Board bad not to found its reputatior in a-day; let them, then, wait, and, likc prudent men, look out for An establishment in a central and good position. Mr. D'IFFANGER said Mr. Samuel Hemming, of Cliffhonmc, portable building manufacturer, had offered to erect a suitable temporary building on the premises at Greek-street for 1,1081., and that if the same were given up to him at the end of fivo years he would repay 4004 of that SUM. Mrr. LEsLrE observed that not a single memorial had been presented against Greekstrce't, while there had been menmorials representing upwards of 5,000,OO. of rental and 1,000,000 of the population in favoulr of that locality. hr. WILFKLNSON moved, by way of amendment, that the followinug words be added to the resolution:.- "And that it is inexpedient to incur any conmiderable outlay in the erection of permanent offlces at present, but that the Committee on Sites be empowered to make arrangements for the temporary accommodation of the Board on the premises in Greek-street at an outlay not exceeding £1,05, A question was raised as to whether the amendment could he put, seeing that it was one similar to a motion vwhich had alrea,dy been negatived. The CH.AISN (after conferring with the clerk) dybided that it could be put. The Linendment was seconded by Mr. DlIFFAXGER, and tlh Board divided, when there were 15 in favour of it and 9 against it; but, as the act of Parliament requires a majority of two-thirds of the mcmbors present in order to rescind any resolution of a former Board, the amendment was de- The original resolutioe was then pUt, and on a division was also lost, there being 7 for it and 15 against it. The result, therefore, of unpwards of three hoursB discus. sion was to leave the matter in exactly the sa.me position as it stood before the special board was sumLmoned. The Board then adjourned.
BELIGIOUS LIBEBTY IN SWPEDEIy _ . TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-It ma perhaps be interesting to Englishmen to see the Minister's proposition for settling in Sweden the long agitated question of freedom of conscience, or the right of an individual unpunished to dissent from the Estaolished Church. It should be observed that according to the constitution of the country every Swedish subject has ful and complete religious freedom, as long as he does not invade his neighbour's civil rights. Notwithstanding this, the clergy constantly endeavour, under virtue of an old para. graph in the criminal code, to havo persons punished who leave the established communion. Unfortunately, they too often succeed in getting them exiled or imprisoned; indeed, about a twelvemonth or so ago there were more than 50 persons in one parish imprisoned for dissent. These are caUed "I4 isare," i. c., readers (scit. of the Bible). His Majesty, in his address to the Houses of Parliament, recommended that the law should be put in conformity vith the constitution, which, indeed, is what every reasonable man wishes. The Minister, however, seems inclined only partialy to fall in with His Majesty's recommendation, as, although in some things he proposes to abolish the persecuting law, in others he completely sets at naughtthe constitution, and proposes new laws for oppressing the Disser'er which did not exist before. The Minister's proposal is aS follows:- 1. After repealing the penal statutes against those who leave the established for any other communion, this paragraph proposes that all who do so and refuse to return on being exhorted by the minister of the parish should regis ter their secession in the parish books. (This is reasonable and right, as the Swedish Church does not exact contributiomn from those who do not belong to her communion.) 2. This paragraph prohibits the disseminating of doctrine contrary to that of the Lutheran Church in the congregations or by the ministers of that Church, under a penalty of from 100 to 500 daler (18s. 6d. to 4. 12s. 3d.) or of imprisonment from two months to one year. Any priest of the Swedish Church aiding in the preaching or spreading of false doctrine to be answerable as if for canonical faults, but such priest not to be prosecuted without the concurrence of His 3rajesty's "Justitiekansler." Should the heresy have been disseminated by means of the press, thecase is to be dealt with by the law that regulates the liberty of the press. " 3. Whoeverattemptsbypersuasionto getany one to secede from the Swedish Church, orby deceitful means, threats, or promises of temporal advantaqe endeavours to allure any. one to such secession, shLU (if the act be not through some other law subiect to a heavier punishment) for the first offence be finea from 100 to 30D rixdaler-riksmynt (61. ls. to 61. 13s.); and for every subsequent offence shaU be imprisoned from two months to one year. " 4. Children of parents that are members of the Svredish Church shall be considered as belonging to that Church, and shall be brought un in the Lutheran doctrine, even if the larents, after the birth of the child, have gone over to another communion. If only one of the parents after mar- a should go over to another communion, this law is to holas regarls aU children born of that marriage. ' It is the duty of the parochial officials to see that this statute be not transgressed by parents and guardians. If the education of any child belonging to the Swedish Church be committed to a parent or guardian, and an educator or teacher infect the child with any other doctrine than that of the Swedish Church, the parent or guardian to be punish. able as stated in paragraph 3. 5. The existing law, both with respect to members of foreign communions and to Swedish subjects who secede from the State Church, so farj%s it is not altered by this statute, is to remain in force. " No one can, on the ground of his religion, be considered as dispensed from obedience to the law of the land. If his religion do not permit him to make oath where such is required by the law, and there be no special statute on the subject, the King, after the decision of the highest court of justice, ahaU determine what is to be done. "i. Members of the Swvedish Churh, besides the ordinary public ass-r-ice of God, shall hare the right of assemn hung freely and unhindered for purposes of worship and devotion, provided nothing be done in such assemblies that is op,posed to lawr and moralitv; and in consacenee hereof the Lioyal Ordinance of Jan. 12, 1726, forbidding such as,5emblies, to be hereby repealed. Admission to religious mucetings which do not tLake place under the regular priesthood's immediate superintendence, and cannot be considered as mere family worship, is not to be refused to the clergy of the parish, nor to the local authorities; and these lItter have authority to dissolve soch meetings on the occurrence of any breach of the law, or any disorder1 if they think fit. Moreover, no such ileet ing may take p ace, witbout especial permission, during the time of the regular parochial service, under pcnalty of from 50 to 100 riksdaler-riksmynt (21. 15s (6d. to 5. lls.), to be levied on the person who calls together or finds house-room for such meeting; and a penalty not exceeding 10 rdr. n-mt. (ls. 2d.) on each person present." Such is the Ministerial proposition, which is said to be the work of the Minister of Education (Dr. Anjou) and the Bishop of Lund (Dr. Thomander). It is hardly necessary to say that it is very unsatisfactory to the people. The constitution of the country requires of the Sovereign that ' he neither force, nor allow any other to force, the conscience of any one, but that he protect erery individual in the free exercise of his religion, providod he do not thereby disturb the peace of society or cause universal scandal." His Majesty's commission to Miisters was to alter the conim mon law in conformity with this fundamental law, and such is the nation's wish. It seems, therefore, little else than a mockery and insult both to the Sovereign and tha people to come forward with a proposal in the teeth of the constitution, to punish vith fine and imprisonment the man who endeavours, " by persuasion," to get his neighbour to think asbhe thinks; to invadethe parent'sright. and fine and imprison tho parents who teach their owvn child their own religion. I can hardly imagine that Ministers will succeed in carrying this measure, such a gross infraction of the parental right is so directly contrary to every Swede's feelings; but it is singular that clergymen, otherwiso honourable and distinguished men, sbould perseveringly endeavour to tread inder foot the consciences of their countrymen, and insult a liberal and enlightened Sovereign by seeking to publish, in the name of Oscar of Sweden, a vile and persecuting edict fit only for Ferdinand of Naples I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Tl3E Comm- POLICE A?ND THE GARor'z.-At the Worcestershire Quarter Sessions on Monday last thero was a very large attendance of magistrates, among whom were the Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington (chairnan), Earl Beau. champ, Lord Lyttelton, the Hon. F. Lygon, Ir. J. . H. Foley, 3P., Sir T. E. Winington, Ml? Sir 0 P. Wake. ian, &c. The principal county business brought before the Court was two motions for increasing the police force in the most populoos districts of the county. The present number nf the pohce force is 114, and there were twro n;oticn before the Court for increasing the number to 174 -1vi by adding 18 to the Dudley district, and 42 to the StoArirdge district. It appearing, however, that the new Government Police Inspector was about to vsit the'&6inty to report as to its requlrements, it was resolved to adopt a medium course, and to appoint nine additional Inen for the Dudley and IS for the Stourbridge district until the next sessions. SirJ. Pakington approved this temporary meaus. He said there was iunoubtely a good deal of crime being comnjitted in various parts of the country just now, but nevertheless he thought there was a panic in the public n,ind on the subject. Everybody was talking about outrages by ticket-of-leave nen and of garrotte robberies. He hougt this arose from a panic, bat that it woulld be re. n,eved and forgotten in three montbs. Lord Lyttelson queed with Sir John Pakington that a groat deal of alarat existed ix the public inid on this subject, but they mnct not forget that they had still the worst part of the winter to gothrough. Captain Bennett, who subn,itted the tnotioft to the Court for the inerease in the Dudley force, said that the inhabitants in that district wete afraid to venture out after nightfall, and even working men after receiving their wages dared not go home alone. He and his brother magistrates had had as many as 70 cases brought before them in one day. ORYSTAL.

THE MURDER OF CHILDRE-V rN LAMIBETH. Yesterday Mrs Martha Bacon, the unfortunate woman charged with the wilful murder of her two childrennamely, Edwin Fuller Bacon, aged two years and a half, and Sarah Ann Bacon, aged eleven months-was broukht up from Horsemonger-lane Gaol for further examination before Mr. ELLioTr, at the Lambeth Police Court. The prisoner, whose general health seemed somewvhat improved since her last examination, was accommodated with a seat at the end of the solicitors' table, and fronting the bench. While the witnesses were giving their evidence she kept her eyes steadily fixed on them, bnit did not utter a word, and even when the horrible scene which her house exhibited when the murders were discovered, and the shocking state in which the poor little children were found, were being described, she did not evince the slightest emotion. Her husband, who was seated near to her, on the contrary, seemed deeply affected, particularly at some portions of the evidence. Mr. Woodward, of the firm of Messrs. Taylor, Collison, and Woodward, solicitors of John-street, Bedford-row, attended and said he -was present to watch the case, at the request of the friends of Mr. Bacon, who were respectable persons at Stamford, in Lincolnshire. Since the last examination of the prisoner the case has asmingd a very serions as well as a tragic character-in the first pl.zre, from the fact of Mr. Bacon, the prisoner's husband's assertion that between the time of his leaving home, at a very early hour on the morning of Monday, tu proceed to Reigate, and returnsing to his house on the Wednesday morning, it had been robbed of a suit of clothes, a watch, and 71. in cash; and in the next from circumstances that have occurred at Stamford, and from which it appears that the poor children who have unfortunately becomse victinms to the insanity of their unhappy mother have had a narrow escape froin destruction in another way-that of being burnt to death. The Stamfordc ercury of last week, commenting on the report of the former examination of the prisoner at the police court, says:- 8 The above melancholy cas wiU be read with painful interest in Stacnford. The unfortunate woman is the wife of Thomas Fuller Bacon, formerly a whitesmitis in this town. It will be remembered that some months ago Bacon's house on Peter's-hiU was burnt in the night time, and that the poor children who have met such an awful death were then removed from the burning premises by a female servant, who was, with the father, apprehenided on a charge of arson, but afterwards liberated, Bacon himself having leen tried at the Lincoln assizes and acquitted. Mrs. Bacon was at that time in a lunatic asylum, where she remaired a considerable period." The witness Elarriett Payne, examined on the former day, was recalled, and, her former deposition having been read over to her, she was further examined by the magistrate as to the expressions made use of by the prisoner when she first saw her on the Tuesday morning and subsequently on her way to the station-house and to this court, but she could not recollect anything beyond her saving that it was not she that did it, but that a nian had entered the house by a back v.indow, who had murdered both her children, and endeavoured to cut her throat. The witness further said that the prisoner had not enjoyed good health since the birth of her youngest child, and in Juno last she was sent up from Stamford to St. Luke's Hospital, and she (witness) accompanied her there. She also frequently visited her while at St. Luke's, and on each occasion she used to inquire most affectionately for her children. She (the prisoner) was in the hospital from Juno to tlse 17th of October last, wvhen she left, and after leaving accompanied her husband into Lincolnshire, and brought her children to town. Her husband and herself at that time went to live in the neighbourhood of Covent-garden, and subsequently at hennington. Mr. ELLIoTT.-Ylou say the prisoner always anxiously inquired about and evinced great love for her children ? Witness.-Yes, Sir ; she always did. Mr. Woodsvard declined putting any question to this witness. Police-constable William Henry Cook was next called, and, in addition to his former evidence, said that he took away two of the three knives he found on the breakfast table sn the back parlour, where the eldest child was found. There wer,3 three knives on the table, but he only took two, as those were closest to the body of the child. The eldest child when found was sitting in an easy chair, a table placed close up to binu, and his head was resting on his arms on the table. There were some toys or playthings on the table at the time, and mnore on the ground. In reply to the questions of the Magistrate this witness further said he had carefully examlined the garden and back part of the honse, and could not trace thle slightest marks of footsteps. He also exauiined the back windows, and found them so secure that no person could have entered the house by them. Of this fact the witness was the more certain from there being a quantity of dust on the window sills which hadnot been disturbed for a considerable time, and which must have been removed had anvbody got in. Mr. John BasheiL surgeon, of Kennington-lane, was next called, and the evidence he had given on the Tuesday before read over to him. In addition to it he said that since the last examnination he had exaumined the two knives produced by the constable with a powerful microscope, and on one of them he could clearly discern globules of human blood, while the other was perfectly free from any such stains. Mr. ELLIOTT.-Did the knife marked with these globules appear sharp ? Mr. Bushell.--It was sharp, and it appeared to me as if it had been recently sharpened on a steel, or something of that kind. Mr. Bushell further said that on examsining the bottom part of the nightdlress belonging to the prisoner, and found in her bed in her room, he found it deeply stained with arterial and not venons blood, and it appeared to him as if impelled on the part in a spirt, or jet, and not dro_ped there. .ELLIOTT.-IS it your opinion, Mr. Bushell, that the prsoner inficted the wounds on her thiroat herself, or that they were done by somebody else? Mr. Buqhell.-It is my decided opinion that they were done by lserself, for had they been done by another her exertions to protect herself and prevent them would have caused them to be much more severe. Besides, sbe would have used her hands as her natural defence, and, if so, they would have beeni injured; but on examiiining them I cannot discover a scratch. On Tuesday last, on examining her hands. I clearly saw the marks of blood about them, particulasly on the left band and its finger niails, though the hands liad been waghed, Mr. ELLIOTT.-WaS the knife you have described such an instrument as the injuries inflicted on the deceased children, and which caused their death, might have inflicted withb? M1r. Buwhell.-Oh' certainly. Indeed, the prisoner herself said the injuries upon her were done with a knife. Mr. Woodward.-I understand, Mi. Bnishell, you avoided plutting any questions to the prisoner, believing her at the time to be of unsound mind? Mr. Bushell.-My impression decidedly was that she was not right. Mrs. Monroe deposed that on Sunday week she saw the prisoner and her husband, both of whomi had called on her to requesS slie would go and stop a week with the former, as the latter was leaving town for a week to go to Reigate. On the following evening (Monday week) she left her home for the purpose, and reached Four Acre-street at about 5, and, though she remained there for upwards of two hours, and knocked repeatediy. she could nut make any one hear her, n:or obtain admittance into the house. A~bout lO o'clock~ she again returned and again knocked, but wvas e.qually unsuccessful. Mlr. Vranke, a person who lives next dto.r, said that on bearing the last witness knock he on two different occasions looked at the hack of the house, hut could not observe anything more. Not hearing the children cry as usual, witness again looked on the follosving mornsing, when he saw the childrens' clothes on a chair, and then suspected something had happened. inspector Young. of the L division of police, who has the nmanagemuent of the case, here addressing thc magistrate, said that he was informed by Mr. Bac,;:m, tho prisoner'as husband, that his househad been robbed of a suit of clothes, a w.atch, and {l. in cash, and he (Mr. Youelg) was at present engatged in investigating that part of the case, but had not X et had time to complete it. Mir. WVoodward expressed a hope that his WVorship wo'sld poostpone the case beyond the present sittings at the Old Bailey, as it would he quite impossible for himn to prepisre a defence during the present sitting. Mr. ELLIoTT observed that there wras this awkward circunmstance attending the c.ase, and that was that the coroner had bouind over the witnesses to appear at the present sittings to give evidence. MIr. Woodward said be had seen M[r. Cla3rk, the clerk of the Arraigns, that morning, and that gentlemn;a informed him that the recognizances of the witnesses on tbe inquisition would be enlarged till the next se3sion. Mr. ELLIOTr remarked that, thsis beinlg thie case, it would be better, runder all the circumnstances, thst the prisoner sho?uld be remanded over the present se.ssion, and therefore adjoulrned the case to a future day. The prisoner w.as then removed.

COUNTY COURTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In a former letter I pointed out how natural-I had almost said how unavoidable-it wasthatinthe constrnction of the County Court system the usual errors sbould be coma mitted which beset partial legislation. Mr. Eitzroy and his friends were probably themselves doubtful how far their experiment might safely be carried. Westminster, insufflcient to prevent, was amply sufficient to dwarf the new legal creation. And, in truth, there was much reason for caution, if not distrust. The admirers of our constitution hesitated to intrust habitually to a single nmind the decision of questions of fact, which had been ordinarily submitted to the decision of a jury. Mindful of the great benefits which the jury system had conferred upon us, they feared an encroachment on it which might possibly be the precedent for future innovations. Barristers and attorneys were equaUy fearful of a system which, it was supposed, would tend to diminish the amount of professional business. Those educated in the old forms of special pleading dreaded the inaccuracies which would be sure to arise from the want of definite issues; and statesmen doubted the wisdom of establishing 60 different cou-ts of little cohesive affinity, for which it might soon become necessary to pass an act of uniformity. Amid this conflict of opinions and interests what foUowed was but natural. Now influenced by Westminster, and now yielding to popular impulse, the Legislature propounded a series of provisions which scarcely deserve the name of a system, the main objects of which I shall endeavour to explain in language as little technical as possible, that we may see, first, their complexities and defects; and, secondly, how those complexities and defects may be remedied. In doing this I confine myself mainly to the legal jurisdiction of the County Courts, proposing to refer only incidentaUy to their equitable and semi-equitable jurisdiction; and I pray that if, in carrying out my object, I seem in some [points unnecessarily minute I may be supposed to enter into those details only which are necessary to show the intricacies in which the legal profession and the public are unnecessarily involved. The legal jurisdiction of the County Courts, say the commissioners who reported upon them to Parliament during the last session, " is of tbree kinds-exclusive, concurrent, and by consent." They were in the first place to be courts for the recovery of " small debts." What debts should be treated as small debts? The Legislature seems to have considered 51 as their limit, for they prevented the removal of any plaint into the superior courts unless the debt or damage exceeded that amount. But to confine the new courts to claims below 61. would not have satisfied the most modified demands of the public, and would have, even at starting, degraded the new tribunals in popular estimation. 201, therefore, not 51., v-as the msxisussm to which the compulsory jurisdiction of the County Courts was to extendthat is, the limit within which the plaintiff might bring his action. 201., however, was not only too high to suit Westminster ideas, but was in truth, as I have stated before, at least an average of the amounts for which, even in the rich manufacturing districts, verdicts had been for many years obtained at the assizes. Between 61. and 201. the plaints might, it was provided, be removed into the superior courts by leave of one of their judges, and on such terms as he should think fit. I may remark in passing that this power of removal, in almost every case which I have been able to trace, has been exercised by the defendant (whose real motives the judge applied to has now scarcely any means of ascertaining) for the purpose of terrifying the plaintiff by the prospect of an expensive litigation ; or, as I have known it done some six weeks since, with the intention of gaining time for an embarrassed defendant, by throwing the decision over to the next assizes, possibly, as in the instance last alluded to, from four to five months distant. The new courts having obtained jurisdiction up to 201. generally, the old ones engrafted on this general authority several exceptions. Some of these exceptions, such as actions for criminal conversation, for seduction, for breach of promise of marriage, and for libel or slander, are not deserving of much encouragement, and, as a class; might properly be taken from local tribunals. But the moment that, departing from this class of excep. tions, which may be termed exceptions of principle, the Legislature began to draw distinctions based upon a supposed difficulty in practice of the actions to be dealt with, they plunged into a chaos of uninteUigible confusion. Thus the County Courts might not try an action for a malicious prosecution, bnt they might try an action for false imprisonment. They had not cognizance of any action of title, or of ejeetment, but in replevin they might decide all questions of title without limit as to amount; and landlords might, after the expiration of the tenancy (a point involving the nicest questions of the law of landlord and tenant), recover possession of their houses or lands if the rent or value did not exceed aOf. a-year, and no fine had been paid. They eould not decide upon the Talidity of any devise or bequest under a will or settlement, yet in questions of interpleader requiring immediate attention for the protection of their own officers these very questions were practically and frequently determined by them. They were permitted to entertain plaints for the recovery of a demand which was the whole or part of a legacy under a will, but if the will had been so worded that the executor had the smallest "trust," as it is technically called, confided to him, Westminster asserted her prerogative, and the poorer legatees, peculiarly requiring protection, were virtually denied it. Such are some, among many, of the inconsistencies-I had almost said the absurdities-into which, faltering between two opinions, now disposed to innovation, now yielding to precedent, the Legislatu re fell. Among the least reasonable of the distinctions adopted in the new courts was that drawvn between actions of contract and tort-a distinction founded rather upon old fictions than on new realities. To make the matter somewhat plainer to non-professional readers, the County Courts were supposed sufficiently intelligent tO decide upon inquiries by which a man sought to establish his rights, but it required the intelligence of a superior court to hear a complaint about his wrongs. Neither, indeed, was absolutely forbidden, but a 51. wrong had precisely the same difiiculty as a 201. right. The means whereby this distinction was enforced were, as I shall show hereafter, still more objectionable than the distinction itself. I am at present pointing out some of the unreasonable evils which the want of any fixed principle of guidance has introduced.* But since the establishment of the County Courts in 1846 chaos has become more chaotic, and (I speak now only of the limits of jurisdiction) confusion worse confounded. In the constitution of that which should least of all be subjected to such impulses, the Legislature, wandering over a sea of uncertainty, certainly without compass, alnost without steerage, has drifted us into such a position that, unless soule firmer and more far-seeing pilot than lias yet appeared assumes the helm, we are in danger of shipvrecking not merely the consistency of our legal system, but, what is far more important. the respect of the people for our law and its admiinistration. In 1850 the (so-called) compulsory jurisdiction of the County Courts was extended from 201. to 501. If the former could scarcely be considered the " small debts" limit, no man dreamt of assigning that position to the latter, and, whatever might have been the intention of their proposers, the County Courts becamne avowedly competitors with Westminster-hall for thim trial of claims which, extending from 201. to 501., far exceeded the ordinary assize average throughout England. Nor does the public confidence appear to have been misplaced. From August 14, 1850, down to December 31, 1855, the latest date to which we have an authentic return, 32,954 cases above 201. and not exceeding 501. were determined in the County Courts. All these were subject to an appeal at the instance of either party dissatisfied with the determination or direction (to include jury cases) of the Court, in point of law, or upon the admission or rejeetion of evidence; yet only 142 such appeals were made, of which 55 were dropped, in 43 the decisions of the County Courts were confirmed, and in 3 they were reversed. wtsn tmis statement 1, for the present, conclude. If it stood alone it would show how far the County Courts have encroached upon the tabooed territory of the superior courts; but it will be found on further inquiry that the encroachment is not only already of far greater magnitude, but is year by year inereasingx until those at least who are attached to Westminster-ha , and desire, as I do, to see it j continue the central fountain of justice, are compelled to force upon public attention the necessitv of reconciling into one harmonious system the complicated and now jarring elements of our civil indient.nrn A COUNTY-COURT OFFICER. I wr.ite thus with every respect for the Commissioners, from the opinion of the majority of whom I differ; and it is not nnworthy of remark that of 17 witnesses examined before them 12, including r. (now Baron) Bramwell, reject this distinction, 4 adopt it partially, and 1 only, so far as I can vunderstand his evidence, adheres to it.

CHIDLEY, in applying on his behalf for a certificate, said the bankrupt's ancestors and himself had carried on the same business during the period of 130 years. The formation of the railway, leaving Henley at a distance of five or six miles, had prejudiciaUy affected the banLrupt's trade, and the creditors were desirous that he should receive a first-class certificate. His HoNoUR said the accounts, extending over a period of two years, commenced with a deficiency. The bankrupt would receive a certificate of the second class. A certificate of the second-class was also granted to Mr. Maxted, draper, of Chatham. IN RE W. C. COOPB. The bankrupt was a cheesemonger of Warwick-street, Pimlico. Bis application to pass his examination was opposed by Mr. Bagley. The bankrupt had, it was alleged, made an assignment of certain property to a friend, who had squandered it away.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, Jan. 6. IT RE JAMNTES BUETK. (Before Mr. COmmiqiOn" MT'RPTV I 'this case, which was mentioned in The Times of hfonday Ilast, had stood over for the production of a power of at. torney from the creditors, by virtue of which an opposition had been entered to the insolvents discharge. It was to-day proved that the notice of the insolvent's hearing had been duly served upon the creditor, the Rev. 'Mr. Hose, of Dunstable, and that that gentleman had forwarded it to his attorneys, Messrs. De Jersey and Co., which, as it was contended, was an implied authority to oppose the discharge. A letter was also produced from the rev. gentleman, who was in infirm health, ratifying the act of his attorneys. The learned Co 3flSIoSER held that there was sufficient authority from the creditor to warrant the opposition. The case then proceeded, and the ground of opposition was, that theinsolvent had vexatiously defended an action brought to recover a quarter's rent. a peared that he took from Mr. Hose's agent a house at Camberwell, and signed an agreemeut to hold it for one year at least. He however, occupied it only one quarter, the rent for which he paid, and, upon being sued for the amount due on account of the next quarter, 61. 5s., he defended the action, and caused the creditor 131. lOs. law costs. In reply to the creditor's complaint, the insolvent said the house was quite uninhabitable from the overflowing of the drains, which rendered the kitchen useless and the whole place unhealthy. That two preceding tenants had quitted the house from the same cause, one after three weeks, and the other after a very brief occupation; and that when he quitted it himself he let it to another person, who only remained a short time. He offered to give up the house, but the attorneys refused to accept, and sued him in the superior court for 61. 5s., instead of applying to the cheaper tribunal-the Comuty Court. Mr. Commissioner MURPHY thought there had been some rather nice litigation on the part of the attorneys, but at the same time the Court was bound to reprehend conduct wbich entailed expense upon creditors in recovering their legal demands. 'he insolvent would be discharged in six weeks from the vesting order, which would prolong his inprisomnmet far about 10 days longer. abusequently, the learned COUASM.SIONER inquired whether it was intended to enforce payment of the arrears of rent from the insolvent, as in that case he should certainly not pronounce any remand ? The attorney's clerk said, he had no instructions, and the case was adjourned for a week for information upon that point. The insolvent's hail was enlarged.
ORLYTR4L CRL.UIAilL GOURT, Jat2, 6. OLD COflThP (Before the RECORDER.) Richard May, 54, a well-known thief, was indicted fc r stealing 441., the property of Stephen Rose. lr. Sharpe prosecuted; Mr. Ribton defended the pri. soner. The prosecutor in this case was a countryman, and it appeared that in the beginning of December he had come to London to receive some money, and came into possession of the Sum mentioned in the indictment, which he had placed for security in the hands of the landlord of the publichouse wbere he was lodging. On the 12th of December he went out for a stroll, and as he was passing along New Oxford-street he was accosted by the prisoner, who inquired whether he had been to the Cattle Show, and after some little conversation had passed between them they adjourned to a publichouse to drink. They were there joined by a person of respectable appearance, who said that he had come to London to receive a legacy, and that one of the conditior.s of the bequest that had been made to him was that he should give a certain sum to the poor. The prisoner sa:d be belonged to Reading, and that he should be glad to have some of the money for that parish, and the third man sald he would give him 201. The prisoner then said that no doubt "his friend," meanine the prosecutor, would be very glad to have 201. also, and the s ranger expressed his readliness to give him the same amount, but said that before he parted with his money he must be satisfied they were respectable people by seeing wbat amount of "capital" they could exhibit. The prisoner then produced some money, and the prosecutor was induced to go to the publichouse where he lodged and obtain his 441. from the landlord. A variety of attempts were then made to induce the prdsecutor to part with the possession of the money, but he was evidently suspicious of his company, and at length a rather new mode of proceeding was adopted to effect the object. After the parties had been drinking for some time the third man went out, and when he returned he produced two empty purses, and the prisoner said he should like to have one of them, at the same time observing that "his friend," the prosecutor, would like to have the other, and the third man said he was quite willing to give them each one. The prisoner then Raid that as he could not "et the 201. he should expect to be paid a sovereign for'iis loss of time ; and the stranger, as heappeared to be, sad he would ive him a sovereign if he vvou hand his purse to hinm, and the prisoner did so, and the man appeared to put something into it. He then offered to give a sovereign to the prosecutor if he would allow him to put it into his purse himself, but the prosecutor refused to part with his purse, and said that if the man chose to give bim the sovereign he would hold the purse open for him to drop it in. He accordingly did so, and the prisoner's companion pulled what appeared to be a sovereipn from his pocket, and eeemed totbe in the act of putting it into the purse, but at the same instant he made a stumble, and snatched the purse out of the prosecutor's hand, and on rising adroitly substituted another purse containing some copper coins and medals,representingsovereigns, forthe one thateontained the money. The prisonerand hiscompanion,havingthuseffected their object, left the publichouse, but the prosecutor, who appeared to suspect that sonething was wrong, followed them immediately, and laid holdof theprisoner, and held him until a policeman came up, the other man, unfortunately, escaping withl the the prisoner was searched some false coinsand a lock, an instrumentwhich is frequently used by persons of the prisoner's class for the purpose of defrauding simple people, by bets being laid respecting the power to open it, were found in his possession. he lurg returned a verdict of Gzuily, and an officer informed the Court that the prisoner had been in custody before upon a similar charge, and that he was constantly prowng about the streets upon the look out for persons likelyto be subjects of plunder. The RECORDER sentenced the prisoner to be kept to hard labour for one year. John Burke, 52, was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. It appeared that the prisoner had carried on a most impudent system of fraud, by representing that he was em- ployed by the Commissioners of Sewers for the city of tondon, and in that capacity applying to different tradesmen, stating that the drains to their houses were out of order, and that he would make them " all right" for a small sum, and by this means he. obtained diffeent sums of money, it turning out that there was nothing the matter with the drains, end that the whole proceeding was a scheme to obtain money by fraud. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to nine months' hard labour. William Brookfield, alias Burkinshaw, aged 22, was charged with being feloniously at large before the expiration of a period of transportation to which he had been sentenced. The prisoner pleaded " Guilty." Mr. T. ArinUISON, who appeared for the prosecution, informed the Court that the pnsoner was convicted in 1855 of the offence of wounding and infficting bodily injury dangerous to life, and sentenced to transportation for life. He was removed to Woolwioh pursuant to his sentence, and contrived to make his escape from that place, but was apprehended at Wandsworth. The RECORDER sentenced the prisoner to one month's imprisonment and hard labour, and then to be transported for life.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Tu,alv, Jan. 6. VIejore Mle A SsTAYrJUrjDG at the Gusildhall, West- minster.) Sarah Hogan, 30, pleaded " Guilty" to an indictment charging her with feloniously breaking and entering the dwellinghouse of William Robert Bragger, and stealing therefrom two German silver teaspoons and a dress, value 4s., his property. From the dostons it appeared that the prosecutor lived at No. 11, ke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 16th of Decen,ber he went out, accompanied by his wife, looking the door and taking the key wth him. In About three-quarters of an hour he returned and put the key into the door, but found he could not open it. He then pushed it, and there was a resistance inside. He then pushed harder and forced the door open, when he saw the prisoner inside the room, with two spoons in her hand, and a bundle in her arms containing a quantity of articles she had taken from the dra.wers. In a short time afterwards the wife returned and found a dress, that was hanging up when she went out, twisted up in a rpal behind the door. Under the toilet cover was found a key which did not belong to them, but would open the room door. The prisoner said she had called for some work from a person named Williams, and that she had been shown into the room, but there was no person of that nave in the house. A policeman was sent for, and she was given into custodv. Four foriner convictions were then proved against herviz., on the 27th of October, 1851, for four months; on the 12th of April, 1852, for eight months; on the 31s' of October, I ,for 1S months; and on the 28th of July, 1856, for three months. The pnisoner, on hearing the detail of her former convictions, t rew herself on her knees in the dock, and exclaimed, "Oh, God, have mercy on me; oh, my Lord, have mercy upon a poor unfortunate; give me the opportunity of reformation !" The A srssTA-T-JuDoz said he would give her time and Opportunity for reformation by passing a sentenco that ould for some years prevent her from committing other offences. It would be useless to pass upon her a sentence of imprisonment, as that had already been tried ia vain ; he should pass one that would have the effect of keeping her n penan servitude for the term of four years. That was the sentence he now pronounced, and he did hope that would not onlv act as a punishment, but also lead to her own reformation. Mary Cormack, 38, pleaded "Guilty" th an indictment, charging her with stealing a quart pewter measure, value hs. 8, the property of Jonathan Holden. Five previous convictions were put in against the prisoner, nd on the last occasion, in April, 1854, she was sentenced to seven years' transportation, but in April of last year was liberated with a ticket of leave. The ASSISTA?;rTJUDG3 commented with sonie severity on the conduct of the prisoner, and sentenced her to be kept in penal servitude for four years. John Edwards, 24, a ticket-of-leave man, was indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwellinghonse of James Gray and another, and stealng therefrom 811b. of lead pipe, of the value of 15s., their property. The evidence clearly proved the case, and the jury found the prisoner Guilty. It was proved that in 1852 the prisoner was sentenced to six month's hard labour, and in 1853 to seven years' transportation. He was liberated on a ticket of leave in August last, and it appeared from a conversation between him and a woman who was in the next cell to him at the stationhouse, on a charge of uttering counterfeit money, which was overheard by the policenian on duty, that since his liberation be had entirely devoted himself to lead stealing, which be had found a very good game." The AssisT,%sT-JuDNu sentenced him to six years' penal servitude. Thomas Beal, seven years of age, who was convicted last week at Clerkenwell of having stabbed annther boy named Charlton, was brought up forjudgment. It was stated by the prisoner's father, when the case was tried, that the -matter would never have occurred if his stepmother had taken care of him and his brothers and sisters, five in number, but that she was given to dissipated habits, the result of which was that neither he, the father, nor the children had anything in the world but what they stood up in. The prisoner's own mother died of the cholera when he was but five maonths old. The AssxsTAN-T-JUDGB admonished the prisoner, and cautioned him not to use a knife against any one in future. He sentenced him to six days imprisonment, which having already expired he was discharged, and given over to his brother, a lad of 15 years of age, who was told to take him home and tell his father to give him a good flogging. (Before Mr. CREASY.) Richard Oliver, 17, and William Thrale. 30, were isdicted for having stolen two tons of coal, the property of Messrs. Lee and Jordein, their masters. MIr. Ribton appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Salter for the nsonrs. Thietria of this case occupied the greater part of the day. The prosecutors were coal merchants at Kensington, and the case against the prisoners was that theytook two tons of coal and dsmposed of them on their own account. The jury found both prisoners Guily. hfr. CnEASv sentenced Thrale to four months', and Oliver to one month'shard labour.
POLrLO. AtSIoN-UsoUsE.-A lad named George Hall was broughl before the LORD MAYOR upon a remand, cbarged with having stabbed another lad, named Moss Wolff, with a knife. The prosecutor, who appeared in a very weak state of health, said,-On Saturday last I was walking along St. James's-place with A lad named Moss Lcwis, when I'saw the prisoner standing at the horse's head of a van of which he was in charge. As we were passing the prisoner called out to us, " I had a bit of pork, and I stuce it on a fork, and I gave it to a Jew thief" I took no notice of him and passed on * but upon his repeating these words I turned back and slapped his face. As I was on the point of leavlag him he plunged a knife into my left side, about 12 inches below my armpit. When he drew the knife away I felt I was ca.t. I did not observe a knife in his band, nor did I notice what he was doing, I found that blood was flowing copiously from the wound, and proceeded home. Dr. Conslatt examined and dressed the wound. I have been compeled to k-eep my bed tiU to-day. The knife went through my coat, waistcoat, shirt, and flannelshirt into my Side Mr, N. J. Conslatt, surgeon, of 4, Castle-street, Houndsditch said,-On Saturday last I examnined the person of the prosecutor, and found in his left side an incised wound about an inch and a quarter in length. I dressed the wound. The knife had evidently glanced on the rib, which prevented it from entering the abdomen, and thus the life of the prosecutor was in aU probability saved. A knife such as that produced by the officer would cause the wound I have described. The prisoner, who cried, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, was remanded. GUlLDHALL.-Mr. Surr Edvward Pack Barber, the secretary to the Samaritan Institution, Victoria-street, Farringdon-street, appeared on bail before Sir RX W. CALRDER at the Justice-room, Guildhall, yesterday for further examinaton, relative to four separate charges of obtaining goods under false pretences, with intent to defraud Messrs. Pensford and Co.. of the City Flour Mills; Messrs. AManners and Wells, of Whitechapel; Messs. Huntley and Palmer, of Reading; and Messrs. Hoare and Co., of Lower East Smithfield Mr. Sleigh attended to prosecute on behalf of Lr. Potter of Farringdon-street, one of the guardians of the West London union; and Mtr. Joyce appeared for Mr. Barber, the defendant. After a great deal of exculpatory evidence had been taken for the defence, and several witnesses caled and examined to show that the evidence of the girls Hayres and Daley, who were examined on a previous day, was not to be believed, those girls were again examined and gave their evidence as foUows _ Mary Anne Havres, in answer to the Alderman, said,-I do not remembeiwhat I stated when I was here before. Sir R. W. CARDg.-It shaU be read to you, and I wish you to pay particular attention to it. Hayres' former testimony was then read over to her by htr. Martin, the chief clerk. Hayres then said,-F did not hear Mr. Barber mention aboutthepairofboots at al. (Sensation.) EUen told me Mr. Barber said so. I did not hear him mention aything about the halfcrown either. Sir R. W. CARDJs.-Do r, then, understand you that the whole statement you nade here is fale ? Hayres. -Yes, Sir; and I am very sorry for it. Mr. Martin having read over to her the statement she now gave, sbe cenfirmed it and signed it with her mark. Hayres-I was at the Institution on Christmas-day 1l55, and had dinner, but no beer. I did not notice any one else having beer. Sir .R. W. uiDs.-It is Very little nse putting any questions to you, for there is no believing wvhatyon say. You very positively swore that the first statement was true, and now you swear as positively it is untrue. Daley was then caUed in, and her former evidence read over to her by Mr. Martin. Daley.-I persist in that statement; it is true. Mr. Barber offered me half-a-crown and a pair of boots if I would come up to the court and swear that I had beer and biscuits on Christmas-day. Hayres was with me at the time Mr. Barber said so. Sir I. W. CARDEN.-NOw, do think what you are about. Mr. Martim.-Did Hayres hear you say so? Daloy.-Yes, Sir. I had no beer on Cl;ristmas-dav. I now the wonman at the lavatories, but never said f had beer in a yellow jug, or that I hoped Mr. Barber would get off. Sir R.. W. CAsRDMX,-It is quite clear there is shocking perjury somewhere. Daley. -I never spoke to Sarah Sandford in my life. (Witnessthen signedaher new depositions.) Sir R. W. CARDBX.-Now let Havres come in, but do not let Daley communicate with her. Hayres.-I know Sandford ; she belongs to the lavatories. I asked her how Mr. Barber was getting on, and that I Iwished he would get off. I told her that I had had beer be- cause Daley told me to say so. EUen Daley said it was in yellow jugs, and was poured out of two-gallon cans. Sir R.. W. CARDms.-I only think it right to Mr. Barber to say that not the slightest imputation rests upon him in consequence of the evidence of these two girls; therefore the charge of subornation of perjury falls to the ground. (Loud and continued cheering.) Mtr. Joyce said he was very glad to hear such an expres. sion of opinion from the bench; a,nd, with respect to the Iamount of bail, he would ask if the same amnount was to be continued now that the more serious imputation had been Sir R. W. CARDEN said certainly not; his own recognizances would be quite sufficient. The case, which occupied. the Court upwards of five bours, was then adjourned until to-morrow. BoW-sTRsET.-Thomas Ridair, a sail-cutter, residing at Hoxton, appeared to answer a sumrions charging him with wilful perjury. Mr. Charnock attended as counsel for the prosecution. The alleged false allegation was contained in an affidavit made at Judges' chambers on the 20th of November last, in a suit in which Mary Anne Ridair, the defea.di , ,,t r, was plaintiff, and the present complainant, hllely alis. bury, ship-chandler and sail-maker, at Linuehoxn-. w,,s de. fennant. The affidavit was made for the purpos, ')f *pij,-sing an &pplication for the discharge of Salisbury, who had been apprehended on the ground that be was about so It,. e the country. Ridair swore in the affidavit that :t ab.ut 3 o'clock on the 12th of that month (November) he was in the Blue Podts publichouse, adjoining the rhop of Salisbury's father, to whom he (Salisbury) is foreman, and saw the father there; that after he had been there souue time Sahsbury came in and entered into conversation with his father aouOt the action, and also about a sunuimons against him for assault, which was to be heard the next day, the 13th of November, at the Thames Police-court, nnd that he declared his intention of leaving the coUntry, and never paying a penny. The order for Salisburs's discham-ge vas Irefused. Salisbury and his father now swore that no such conversation ever took place at the Blue Posts or elsewhere; that on the day in question they were not in that house ti,gether, and that they did not see each other after 1 o'clock, when Henry Salisbury left town for the day. He himwclf further swore that he went with his wife to Woodford in his own "trap," and spent the day there. That he ard lis wife took nner and tea at the house of a friend named Francis, a clipper, to whom he paid a sovereign for clipping a liorse. He also declared that he never had any intention of leaving the country, and never said he had. lHe was cuinfirmed as to the visit to Woodford and as to what occurred there by his wife and by Franci. As there was some difficulty in showing that the defendant was the person who had made the affidavit, Mr. Charnock called his sister, Mary Anne Ridair, who, on the docurnent being shown to her, declared in a loud and angry tone that she could not read, " or, if I could, he should not have stolen my deeds from me." This outbnrst having been checked, she was asked if she knew her brother's signature, and at once replied, "Yes; that is it " The defendant, being asked if he wished to say anything, expressed a wish to ca- witnesses. nlr. JARDnrE observed that he was not going to try the case, but to send it to a jury. Defendant.-In that case I have nothing to say here. The witnesses were tben bound over to appear at the Central Criminal Court; but at the request of Mr. Charnock the formal committal was adjourned to a future day The Rev. J. IL Rodwtll, who has on several occasions appeared at this court in similar cases, preferred a charge of benmg against a wretched-looking woman named ,Eliza The rev. gentleman stated that he saw the prisoner at about9 o'clock on Monday night in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and watched her for some time. He saw her solicit alms from several persons, and receive a halfpenny from his son, whom he sent to give it to her. He had frequently seen her before, and had cautioned her, the only effect if which was that when she saw him she would not beg till he was gone by, and if he went for a policeman she mado her escape the moment his back was turned. On this occasion he kept out of sdht and sent his son for a policeman. The prisoner had, as usual, a child in her arms; she always came out in inclement weather, and with a different child every time. She must have a very large family if they were aul her own. Mr. JARDIN-E commented on the cruelty of exposing a young child on such a miserable night, and committed her A donation of 51. for the poor-box has been received from "B. C.," -who requested an acknowrledgment in 27Uc Times. WEsTmlNsTm-Thomas Wllis, a boot and shoemaker, lving in Dean-street, Westminster, appeared for final examination, charged with uttering a forged 5& Bank of England note. The accused was discharged. A check for 10 guineas from " B. G." was duly received by Mr. PitY'TER, and applied as in former years The first half of a 61.-note from " B. C." also came to hand. CLEMMgwEL~L-Mr. Ex-Sheriff Croll has sent 10 chaldrons of coke for distribution to the poor of the neighbourhood of this court. LAsssr.-A 5l.-note has been received from "L. M. S.," and half of a 5L-note from " E. C.", for the poor-box.
MR. ROBERT PALM ER, M.P., ON CRIrfE AND THE TICKET-OP-LEAVE SYSTEM. At the Berkshire Michaelmas Sessions yesterday, held at Reading, Mr. ROBERT PALMER, M.P., in addressing the grand jury, said,-IthinkI may congratulate yoiunpon thestateof crime in this county. The fact of there being only 25 prisoners for trial does not indicate any great amount of crime here, nor does it positively show any great decrease in ninor offences, because many cases which used to be brought before this Court are now disposed of at the petty sessions in the different divisions of this county. It may be a convenient practice, and would tend to show the real state of crime in the county, if the clerks of the different petty ses.sions were to send in to the lerk of the peace, a day or two before each quarter sessions, a return of the cases disposed of before the magistrates under the Criminal Justice Act, and then the Court would be able to arrive at something like an accurate knowledge of the state of crime in the county. I apprehend that if we had such returns we should find as many more cases had been disposed of under the act of Parliament to which I have referred. That act, in my opinion, has worked exceedingly well- it saves a great deal of timne and avery considerable expense; ithas the effect of bringing home punlshmentto a felon within avery shorttine ofcomoittirg an offence, and having suffered the punishment to which he was adjudged he is restoredto societyagainmuch earlierih3n if he had been sent for trial in this court. We had yesterday a report from Colonel Fraser, our chief constable, relative to the new constabulary in this county. One of the most favourable points in it was, that the expense had n.t exceeded the estimate of 21d. iu the pound made by those who advocated the adoption of such measure. You are probably aware that at the time the question was first introduced there was a great difference of opinien as to the probable cost of establishig a police force in the county; and nowv that it has been in operation for a period of about eight months, it is gratifying to find that the original estimate has not been exceeded. To gentlemen coming from the district of Maidenhead it will be satisfactory to know that, aocordin to a return made out by the chief constable, it appears that in the district of .Maidenhead, vrhere there is a population of 10,000, only 27 cases have comne under the cognizance of the police, showing that crime is on a' very small scale; but in other districts, with a proportionate population, crime is much more extensive. I think, however, on your looking over the return, you wiU fiud that on the whole there appears to have been a diminution of crizre at least in that particular neighbourhood. There is one subject I will not embark upon; still I mu2t address a few remarks to you in reference to it. During this winter assizes, this is the onlv county, I beieve, on the Oxford Circuit, where it has not been found necessary to have a special assize on account of heinous offences committed in the interval of the Isst assizes; but at some of the assizes, a subject, which seeems to be in every one's mouth, has been commented upon-I mean the ticket-of-leavesystem. That system is on trial, and, as far as we can judge from what we have read in 7'lhc Times and other newspapers as to the effect of that measure, it is not flatteringly spoken of. At the sanw time, however, I wil not condemn a system witbout its having a fair trial. It was, probably, a hasty and not vN ry wi'e courseto bave altogetber done away withltle rs stein of punishment by transportation, except in cases of heinious offences. No doubtvery greatdifficulty was experienced by the Government in disposing of the convicts. The colonies, where they were formerly sent, refused to receive them any longer; and if the svstem had been persi,ted in against the remonstrances and wishes of the col.,ijsts. no doubt a state of circumstances would have arisen which would have been very inconvenient. We carnot f. i! to have noticed that in the last six months there have heeri more heinous offences committed, and during the recer,t as;izes more executions, on account of heinous offences. have taken place than have been known for a verv long time past. I have no doubt that when Parliament meets again, the subject must be talen up, and some measures adopted to remedy the evil wvhich seems to be rife at the present time. In a report of Colonel Jebb, an inspector of prisons (a publication which I woold recommend every magistrate to read), wvill be found a eturn showiag some important facts in relation to this system. Colonel Jebb is generally favourable to the system, and from the return he has published it appears that in the year 1854 there were 1,832 persons dischaiged with tickets of leave; that is to sy, persons who had been sentenced to transportation, probably for four or six years, and yet, at the end of two years, their conduct having during that pernod been such as to entitle them to consideration, they ad been set at liberty with that only bsd4e uPon then, of thei previous misconduct-a ticket of leave; but in the year 1833 no less than 3,467 persons were diLcharged upon tickets of leave. Even admitting that this large nuamber of persons had gained considerable moral advant4ges during the term of thei imprisonment, as Government. con-icts eitber in Reading Gaol or elsewhere, or on public works, so aq to entitle them to this privilege, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a good many of them, from a difficulty in obtaming employment, should have recourse to their former course of hfe, and have committed some of the crimes of which we have read in the public newspapers. I will not express an opinion upon the question itself-it has not had a sudicient tniall; but I bave no doubt it will come under the consideration of Government in the ensaing session of Parliament, and something be done in regard to it.
ACCIDEBT IN COENHILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to call your attention to an accident that Occurred yesterday in Cornhill, of which I see no account in The Timas. Three persons were injured-one, I hear, is since deed-and I providentiaily escaped by a few inches. An immense stone, part of a house in course of rebuilding, fell through the ecaffolding. It seems a new plan to pull down and rebui. houses, leaving the shop standing and the path in front open for passers-by. People thus pass under the scaffolding, and the custom of the shop is uninterrupted; but if these advantages are purchased at such an awful sacrifice, is it not better to adhere to the old plan of entirely boarding up the premises and forming a temporary path in the roadway ? The public would, I should think, much prefer this ; and, as to the shopkeeper, is not money earned by a persistence in such a dangerous method blood-money? I arn; Sir. Yonr obedient servant. a. H.

THE LATE GALE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Herewith are readings of the barometer during the continuance of the gale of the 4th and 5th inst. The first three days in January had been mild, with W. and S.W. winds. The 3d was very rainy, with a S.S.W. gale from 11 a.m.; at 6 p.m. the directionx became W., and a, 10 p.m. W.N.W. The 4th was also a day of incessant rain with boisterois N. wind, which by 6 p.m. had become a gale, the direction changing to N.E., and sleet and snow being mingled with the rain. On the 5th, at I a. m., the pressure of the wind was 8Alb. on the square foot, from 1-45 am. till 3 a.m. decreasing to 31b., and a' 4a.m. to 21b.; at 5 a.m. it increased to 71b., and at 7 a.m. was 101b., and by 10 a.m. hRd fallen to 21b. At 7 a.m. the wind's direction became N.E.-by-N., and at 10 a.m. 4Y.N.E. The unusual feature during the continuance of this gale was the rapid rise in the barometer, apparently pointing out much colder weather to north of this place. The following are readings of the barometer corrected and reduced to 148 feet, and also to the sea level:- Conrecteot FresCorrected Pres- lure Reduced Date. Hour. rancto 145foot. to seaisLeveL.

IRBLAND. (FROM OUR ow OORRESPONDUNT.) DUBLI, TUESDAY MloMNxcG. DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF CORK. ThDe CJrk Examinpr announces the death of the Right Rev. Dr. Wilson, Bishop of Cork, which took place yesterday morning at the episcopal palace, St. Finn Barr's. The deceased prelate was fornlerly one of the fellows of Trinity College, Dubl:n, and was consecrated in the year 1848. In politics Dr. Wilson was an old and staunch supporter of the Whigs, and since his elevation had been justly esteemed for a spirit of genuine liberality and the total absence of all evidence of sectarian prejudice. Although naturally of delicate constitution, he nevertheless attained the ripe age of 76 years. The see of Cork is one of the poorest in Ireland, the estimated income yielding little over 3,0001. a-year. A correspondent of one of the morning papers writes as follows under date of Cork, Monday:- "The right llev. Dr. James Wilson was a native of Dublin, having studied in Trinity College, where he took olut his degree of A.M. ia 1809, and was created Doctor of Divinity in lS30. The deceased bishop was raised to the see of Cork in June, 1848. He bad for some years previously filled the office of Precentor of the Cathedral of St. Patrick, Dablin. As a working clergyman his experience was restricted. He had, indeed, filled for 17 years the curacy of St. Audoen's Church, but during that time heresided in chambers in Trinity College and perforned the duties of resident master. The curacy, in fact, was alniost a sinecure. In the year 1828, if I remember rightly, he was appointed Chancelor of Leighlin, and subsequently to the rectory of KUllinane, in the same diocess. He was a fim supporter of the national system of education, but it is nnderstood that latterly his opinions had been somewhat altered, and that he leaned more to the views of the Church :Education Society. Ile for several years had filled the office of secretary to the National Board, previous to his appointment as Precentor of St. Patrick's. He also for many years noted as examining chaplain to the Archbishop of Dublin. It -will be reriembered that upon the death of the late Dean Dawson Dr. AXilson was a candidate for the vacant deanery, to which, however, thepresent Bishopof Cashel, then the Rev. Dr. Daly, was elected, after a very close contest, out of -which arose a htigation, which excited great interest at the time, principally as to the right of Dr. Todd to vote. The decision of the Couirt of Queen's Bench, disallowing the 'vote, contributed to turn the majority in Dr. Daly's favour, and he was thereupon instaUed, but. wvas shortly afterwards made Bishop of Cashel; and Dr. Wilson, the defeated candilate, was subsequently, on the death of the Right 11ev. Dr. Kyle, consoled for his disappointment by being elevated to the bishopric of these dioceses. The deceased prelate was popularly esteemed as a learned and pious divine, distinguished for his experience in ecclesiastical affairs, and for a concilatory and cordial spirit towards those who differed from him in faith. He was, in consequence, regarded with much favour by the Roman Catholics. The umode in vwhich he exercised Isis patronage created on several occasions some dissatisfaction, but this was, perhaps, to some extent, inseparable from the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed. The incomne of the late bishop was nearly 2,5001. a-year. His personal property was smaU." GOVERNMENT PATRONAGE. His Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant has appointed Mlr. Kernan to the office of Clerk of the Crown for the county of Leitrim, in the room of the late Mir. Kernan, uncle to the new official. The Ereci,iug ilItil sarcastically remarks that " it is scarcely necessary to say that the newly appointed clerk is a Rooman Catisolic. There is nothing like beginning the new year well." TIIE IRISII GRAIN TRADE.

The Etvesling lait states that it is intended shortly to emiploy surgeons of the militia in recruiiting for the line regiments, and other duties connected with the service, so as to relieve, to a certain extent, the regimental surgeons, thereby enabliDg these latter to pay greater attention to the sick of their respective corps, and also to attend more closely to the lhospital department with which they are connected.

THE HARD)vl(:KE REUOR31ATORY.-At the Glocestershire Quarter Sessions on Tuesday, Mr. Parnell in the chair, after the usual county business had been trans. acted, Mr. Baker, of Hardwicke, addressed the Court on the progress of the reformation of juvenile criminals in that county, and read a report founded upon information ob. tained from statistics furnished by the police, showinig the numnber of convictions and commitments to the Reformatory in the last five years. Fte believed that the fact of a boy havinig once committed a crime did not make him a regular criminal. In Cheltenham, out of 1GI convicted in the five years, 45, or under 2S per cent., had relapsed into crime, but of the rest of the county, out of 260 boys comanitted, only 10, or not quite 4 per cent., had been convicted a second timne; therefore, according to the old Eton rule, he took 4io notice of first faults, except to record them, but the secondi offonce, or even those fierst offences which magistrates uright think sufficiently serious to send to reformatory schools, he marked. Mr. Baker then gave a list of the marked boys in- the different districts of the county of Gloecester, and remarked of two of them from Cheltenham wioe were respectably connected, and had cornmitted only slight offences, that there were few of whom he had better hopes. Beleving, as he did, that a boy seldom became a regular criminal until he had been twice convicted, he passed over the lirst faults. He had long been strongly impressed with the idea that, whether they considered the reformiation of the prisoners or th$ satety of the public, there was nothing they should more anxiously avoid than the repetition of short iiuprisoDments. Mr. Tartt, a Cheltenham magistrate, begged to be allowed to express the acknowledgments of himself and his brother magistrates to Mr. Baker for wvhat he had done in the reformation of juvenile criminals in the county. Lord laltirerston's act would have been a dead letter in Cheltenham but for the services of Mr. Baker and his coadjutor, Mr. Bengough. The chairman sho acknowledged Mr. Baker's services, observing that the manner in which he bad devoted hi:self to the subject of juvenile reformation w.3r beyond praise; and it was an honour to the county of (loceFter that tils Eystesnl had been first com. menced in the county under the superintenidence of Mr. Baker and Mr. Bengough. A vEiCy AWWIVARD Sr-ATI)xT.-An accident which, though coninie enoungl, iright easily have had a tragical ending, occarred the other day at Madame Ttissaud's Exhihition. A mtiedical student, examining the guillotine in the Chamber of Horrors, took it into his head that the sort of yoke whieh fits down on the shoulders of 4Lhe criminal to hold him in his place would not be sufflcient to cmnfine a person who struggled. llis curiosity on this point led hint to watch till the place was enipty, wvhen he =ctualy put hinself in, letting down the yoke. He soon found that he was quite unable to lift it, and it at once iashed into his rmiud tbae the sharp axewvhich wassuspended over his neck could not be very firruly fixed, or it would not fall (as it d.es) with a touch. He was afraid to struggle, lest the shaking should bring it dov;n and at once deposit his lead in the basket ofsawdust below hi01, into which his eyes were of necessity steadily lookirng. Having stayed solne time in this plight, he was overjoyed to hear the approach of a visitor, whom he implored to release him. " I'm thinking," said the gentlenian (a Szoteh visitor of the metropolis) to hi; wife, " I'm thinking he must be hired to gshowo boww the thing acts, and .1 think we'd hetter not interfere." go the luckless student was left till f.L Tossaud came in, and uade fast the axe beLorereleasirng hiim.

SIR ROBERT PBEL ON RUSSI4. BIRMINGHAM, JAY. 6. Last iiight the new library in Adderley-park was inangu. rated by a dinner given to the members of the late bazaar committee, and subsequently by a meeting in the Museum Room, at which were present Lord Lyttelton, Lord Leigh, Sir Robert Peel, M. P., Mr. Adderley, hLP., Mr. Ml'Geachy, the Mayor of Birmingham, Mr. Charles Ratcliff, and numerous friends of the institution. The great attraction of the night was a promised lecture by Sir Robert Peel on the subject of "Moscow," which proved, upon delivery, to be highly amusing, if not instructive. After appropriate addresses from Lord Lyttelton and Mr. Adderley, announcing the flattering prospect of " the People's Park and Library," Sir R. PEEL presented himself, and was loudly cheered. He said that it was only the day before he had read in a public newspaper that he was expected to appear on that occasion to address an audience upon the far distant city of Moscow. Mis humble services had, however, been, and should be, at tlle disposal of the public. The honbaronet then proceeded to dilate upon the immediate subject with which his name was associated in the pro. gramme. He said,-" You are aware that last summer I went, in company with many others, to that distant country called Russia. I had the proud satisfaction of being conveyed thither on board one of those magnificent vessels which plough the ocean like queens, and gloriously assert tho independence and greatness of our country. (Cheers.) I proceeded up the Baltic, where in the year preceding such mighty fleets were assembled. I passed along the shores of Finland, and arrived within gunshot of that great fortress which Sir Charles Napier did not take. (Loud cheers, laughter, and hisses.) Some gentlemen express dissent from what I state, but I believe it is strictly and literaUy true. (Laughter.) I saw that mighty fortress rising before us. I reflected naturally upon the past and upon the great distinction that might have resulted from any successful operations against it. We then advanced up the Neva, that great and mighty river which flows by St. Petersburg. We arrived at St. Petersburg sufficiently tired by the journey, and expecting to be overcome by the heat. Although it was in the middle of summer it was bitterly cold; the weather was very changeable, like everything else in Russia, and I had the greatest difficnlty to keep myself warm. St. Petersburg is built on piles, and is always very subject to the east wind. (Laughter.) When the east wind blows St. Petersburg has a chance of being done away with, as the public expected Sir Charles Napier would do away with it (laughter) ;-at al events, it then stands a good chance of being sunk in the water. It is not a very magnificent city, and does not strike one by its fine streets and buildings afterall. It has nothing else but granite floors, with outsides all paint and stucco. lts edifices are a great deception, as are most things else we have heard of in Russia. (Laughter.) The Admiralty is a remarkable building situated next to the Viiiter Palace, which palace is the residence of the Czars. It is in this palace that the Emperor Nicholas lived in the simiplest manner, great as was his mind; and it was in a poorly-furnished room on the north-east side that he breathed his last. The square before this palace is one of the largest in the world, and the monolith in the centre is the largest in the world, consisting of a single piece of stone, on the top of which is olaced a monument to tho Emperor Alexander, who died iA 1825. In the Winter Palace are deposited the Crown jewels. I have travelled a good deal and seen many fine sights, but I never saw anything like the splendid jewels belovging to the Sovereign and people of that Court and countrv. They are sometsing beyond belief. The crown exhibits a ruby such as wvas never seen before; the sceptre has the largest emerald in the world ; the ball of state has an enormous sapphire; the Empress's beautiful crown of pearls contains the largest pearl I ever saw; and the effect produced by this congregation of brilliants is something quite magnificent. In this palace there is also a number of portraits of distinguished Russians and great generals, among others the Duke of Welliugton. There is likewise a spleiidid picture by Horace Vernet, illustrating the attack on Poland, one of the most interesting and, at the same time, most bloody episodes in Russiarn history. (Hear, hear.) Another palace is caled the Hermitage. It is, however, nothsng like a hermitage, for it is in the middle of the town, and iolds a most famnous coUection of pictures, originally fromn this country, and known as the Waipole collection. It is a misfortsme that no private individual could be found to secure such a collection for our country; and it is quite out of the question to expect Governments to be liberal on such a niatter. ("' Hear," and laughter). I went to view the pictures one Sunday afternoon. The man in charge of the collection pointed my attention to a quantity of works of art, and said, " Here is the Xertchcollection." I said, " I thought they were all taken by our people" (lauglster), to whicls he replied, " Oh no they were removed by order of the Emperor tvo vears ago." That slsows the prenieditationof the man. (Cheers.) Those pictures had been removed at great cost and difficulty from Kertch to St. Petersburg two years before; and this proceeding leaves little doubt on my mind that there was a great design against the liberties of Europe. (" Hear," and cheers.) The next palace is called the Marble Palace. In everything there is deception, and in this instance there is alzmiost another deception. It is called the Marble Palace because it is built of granite. (Laughter.) The Marble Palace is the residence of that "1 frank and open-hearted sailor" Constantine. How I laughed when I read that description of Constantine's character. (Laughter.) You mnay remember what has been said about the distinguished Admiral Constantine. *With all respect to his Highness, I must say that I never saw a man who gave mne less of the impression of a "f fra', and open-hearted sailor." (Cheers and laughter.) It is all soft sawder, you know. (Laushter.) There is another great palace, the Taurida. It was given by Catherine to the remarkable character called Potemkin-remarkable forthe power he acquired over that most powerful Empress. Potemkin secured to Russia that very spot, the Crimea, in which so much precious blood and treasure has been lately expended by the allies. Potemkin caused the Khan of the Crimea to be a=sassinated, and then attached that border of the Black Sea to Russia. It was he who first raised time post with the well-known inscription, "La route dc Constantinople"-an inscr.ption wisichi it has ever been the anxious desire of the Northern Czars to carry out, and which remains for us ever to resist. (Cheers.) Having finished the palaces, I Will turn to a more serious subject, the churches. The TzAak Church is the chief church of Russia, and 200,0001. was spent in preparing for it a foundation of piles before a single stone was raised. It was commenced 19 years ago, and is not yet finished. In the interior are eight magnificent malachite columns, given by a rich Russian proprietor, Deniidoff, and valued at 1,000,000 roubles. There was not snuch to keep us in St. Petersburg, for we were so horribly fleeced by our innkeeper. (Laugbter.) I have lived a great deal in that way, but I never in my life came across a man with such enormous ideas of the principles of ".doing." (Loud laiughter.) I am a sean who am satisfied with little, but our dinner every night cost us G01. sterling. (Roars of laughter.) lt wai perfectly monstrous. If I had not been in Russia I should have lived withl the police, but I gave up that notion after witnessing the manner in which Russian constables knock peopleabout. (Laughter.) The police use a sort of great antique fork, which they stick into their unfortunate victims,and then leave them on the ground, instead of taking them to a lock-np or something of that kind. lLaughter.) We were glad to get away to Moscow. that being thle great goal of our anticipations. Wbhen we got to the station to start off our luggage was so enormous that the station could not hold it. We took a most extraordinary quantity of clothes, and aU sorts of fancy dresses, and as there were 20 of us, with 20 servants, and nsore than 20 other attendants, you may imagine what a tremendous amount of moveables we camsied about. At last we started, leaving behind what we could not take. In Russia the trains are in the habit of stopping every quer. ter of an hour, and remaining a quarter of an hour when thev dostop. (Laughter.) When we arrived at Moscow we were wearied, but not hungry, having had plenty to eat., for the quarter of an hour stoppages were apparently inad, for the express purpose of eating. (Laughter.) We had most eharming apartments in the carriages. English railway directors are stingy abouttheir accommodation but not so the Russians, for we had every convenience that a wellregulated establishrmnt could possibly desire. (Hear.) After passig the night tolerably wvell, we reached Moscow, and mond 10,000 troops drawn up at the station, together with an enormous quantity of footmen. WVe had just arrived with the Imperial jewels in the same train, and it was thouglit necessary to surround them with this enormous pomp. I had made an agreement with General Sourochokoff, a common man, whose whole anxiety was to impose upon people who trusted in him. At my command he had sent for me to the station a magnificent carriage with four magnificent gray horses. I hastened at once to our dwelling, near the English embmsy, accompanied by my wife, Lord Stafford and his wife, the Duke of Newcastle's son, and Lord Shaftesbury's son. Sourochokoff charged me 100/. for the hire of each horse; and, although I strongly objected to the impost, I was comlipelled to pay his exorbitant demand. We aU had enorwous establishments, and lived at an enormous rate. As the great fair was being held at Nishni, and that being a matter thoroughly unliqse in itself, six or seven of us determined to visit it. I went to the postmaster and found him one mass ot decorations. I was quite frightened with his pomnp and ceremony. He gave me what hecalled an official, bet a man I should have taken for a general officer, so splendid was his uniformn (laughter); he was to guide us, and see that everything was done dt f?s Rus.e. We started in two carriages and six on the 2d of August for Nishni, situated on tile Volga, and just had one week to do everything in. We went from Moscow without provisions, thinking we should find plenty on the road. We could not speak one word to the man who took us in charge, and of course had to leave ourselves entirely in his iands. He took us at a tremendous pace. We travelled on a road as smooth as IHyde Park from Moscow to Nishni, 400 miles, in 28 hours-15, 1G, and 17 miles per hour fre*uently. We were in tlh second carriage, and I once made siLgns to our richly-dressed director that we were not going fast enough, and that the first carriage was outstripping us. 'e immediately rose from his seat, dragged the man from the box, and cast him to the ground, nearly killing himn. (Laughter.) I took care not to complain again. (Cheers.) There was no postillion ready for one of the six horses when we stopped at one post-house, but the direc'or in gold insisted that we must have six horses and six rider.s and, to supply the vacancy, rnshed into the crowd which had collected, seized the first person, put hin upon thc horse, and started off again. The man bad no stockings or shoes on, but that did not matter (laughter) ; he soon got into a dreadful state from riding, and dropped off the animaL The horses frequently became tired, itnd when they fell down exhausted were left by the roadside. The postbovs suffered the same treatment when they became unable to perforrm their dutics. (Laughter.) I do not think I ,yer enjoyed trav-elling so in pmy life. (Laughter.) We slipped quwntities of money into their hands, and they were well contented with us. When we arrived at Nishni, which, under ordinary circumstances, numbers 30,000 inhabitants, but at the fair times contains 400,000 and 500,000, ;we could not for some time get lodgings; and I assure you that, after travelling at that tremendous pace for 28 hours in carriages withoub springs, and without tasting food, we were thoroughly worn out. Eventually we all got into a room; we were compelled to rough it, and shook down in an inn we found there. (Laughter.) Our arrival caused a great sensation, for they had never perhaps seen an English face before. The foUowing night some of our party went to the theatre. The Governor was there, and, seeing strangers, inquired who we were, and as soon as he ascertained he treated us with the greatestpossible hospitality. Daring the whole time I was in Russia I never saw such a brick as the Governor was. (Roars of laughter.) While quietly walking over an immense bridge at Nishni. smoking a cigar, I was seized by a Cossack, who nearly wrung my neck off, and who, holding his great weapon over my head, took me prisoner along the streets. (Laughter.) 1 could not speak a word to the fierce soldier, and was in something like the same position as the Englishman in France, of whom Hood or Matthews "Never go to France. unlese yoe know the lingo, * Or else you w'dl. like me, repent of it, by jingo" Staring like a fool, silent as a mummy, - Tiiere I stood, looking *nation like a dummy." (Bursts of merriment.) We had nothing to sleep on, but had plenty to drink. I never saw a man with such a capacity for drinking as this brick of a Governor (lhughter) ; and no matter how much champagne he drank, I did not notice that he ever appeared affected by it. (Laughter.) He gave us afCte on the Volga, and we had an excellent opportunity of seeing the scenery of this fine river, which flows into theCaspian Sea. 'Whatdelightedus mostwas going into the fair. We sav there Kalmucks and lovely Circassians, the latter being particularly engaging, and I was nearly eng?ged twice by some of them. (Laughter and cheers.) Nishnu is the tea emporium of Europe. We saw thousands of pounds of tea brought there. I brouht, several cases home wltls me, and paid 34s. per pound for them upon the spot. I also saw the people from Bokhara with their precious stones, and purchased from them some torquoises, which I feel sure would realize in this country all that General Soarochokoff robbed me of. (Laughter.) I am always anxious to recover, and never like to be done." (Renewed mirth.) After aUuding to apiurchase of caviare, which cost 1001, per pound before it reached Moscow, and was nasty even then, and mentioning the various races, andthe articles they offered for sale at the grand fair, Sir Robert observed,-" I saw among the crowded and varied people men from Mlanchester and Birmingham, a Staffordshire yeoman and a Scotch lassie, and as I gazed upon them I felt proud of my country, (Cheers.) We hurried back because we knew that on the 24th the Emperor was to enter Moscow, and after a rapid drive of 2S hours arrived in the Imperial city at 5 o'clock in the morniDg. Shortly after that hour the Emperor and Empress arrived at Moscow in grand state-nothing could exceed the magnificence of the Empress's carriage. The Emperor Alexander is a fine-looking man, his appearance and the expression of his physiognomy being mild-in fact, nothing desperate-looking about him. The homage he receives from his subjects is God-like, and such as could scarcely be conceived in a free country. At the unearthly hour of 6 o'clock in the morning I had to dress in uniform to commence a series of presentations which lasted every mortal hour of the whole week. The fatigue we underwent in this duty was enormous; indeed, so great was it that our uniforms hung about us, and we aU lost that reputable rotundity which so peculiarly characterizes Englishmen. (Loud laughter.) We were presented at the coronation by Count Morny, the French Ambassador, a spick and span man of considerable aplomb, and who, by the way, is one of the greatest speculators in the world He speculates in everything, and bought a lot of pictures to sell again and make a profit of. Next to Count Morny stood the representative of a country which deserves tlse sympatlhies of all civilized people, Sardlnia (cheers)General Daboraiida. Then came the Ambassador of the smallest kinigdom in Europe, Belgium, the Prince de Ligne, the very picture of swelling insignificance, so swelling, indeed, that he could not for the life of Isim look down from the contemplation of his own importance. Then there was that fine specimen of a man, Prince Esterhazy, the representative of Austria. Then the representative of Naples, of whom, in charity, I will say nothing. Then the Turkish representative, a clever Turk. Of course he was not admitted into the church. At the same time, you could not look at him without feeling that lie was the representative of an effete and wornout nation. It was imposqible for Turkey to long resist the v.,gression of Russia without assistance. Then came the apal representative, and, finally, that of this country, Lord Granville, than whom no one could more thoroughly represent a true Englishman. He was the representative of the moot powerful nation in the world, yet plainlydressed. When I saw him standing amid the decorated group around him I was reminded of the lines of Burns- " A kiDg can make a belted knight, " A duke, a lord, and a' that; "Buit an honest man's abune his might- " A man's a man for a' that." (Loud cheers.) Then, casting the eye across the cathedral, you saw the distinguished generals of the Russian army, -Todileben, Gortscbakoff,and others,-and, just beside the Emperor, Count Orloff. I believe he was in the palace when Paul was assassinated, and has been the favourite of three great Emperors. He possesses quality of heart and hospit,lity for which I am much indebted. As the Empress entered she fell flat on the floor, I supposed by accident. It was, however, to kiss some sacred stone or other; and then she came in wvith her hair dishevelled, looking like Norma in the opera. The ceremony then took place, and Emperor and Empressweredulycrowned. AtthemomentwhentheEmperor placed his crown on his head the imperial ermine fel to his eet; while that of the Empress feU from her head, and was broken into pieces. These accidents in Rome would have been deemed ill onions. In the evening their Majesties went out to see the illuminations, which lasted three days, and were moot magnificent, so much so as to make one wonder where the Russians got their supply of candles. Then there was a review of 140,000 men, where I figured in the fUll uniform of a captain of the Burton Yeomanry, who would be well pleased to see their commander in the imperial cm-rl,c. There were troops of all the tribes of Russia, Cossacks and Circassans, andso hostile are some of them that two regiments tunied their sham fight into earnest. There was a grand charge of 40,000 cavalry en msasse towards the spot I was standing on. Many of the Russian soldiers had helmetq with bulet marks; bht I suspect they must have been of their own making, or their heads would not have escaped at attie same time. (Laughter.) The next grand spectaclewas an enormous dinner. There is an account of an enormous feast somewhere in the Bible, which I looked for and couldn't find, and which must have been very like the one I beheld at Moscow. Unfortunately the officer who had the management of the feast thoughtthe people vw-ould not behave themselves without a rehearsal, the result of which was that it was all demolished prematurely. Of course he was tried by a drum-head court-martial, and if he did not lose his head was, at all events, disgraced. Then we had a grand cheesc. In this cheaisse at least 800 horsemen were present, besides about 20 men blowing enormous horns, and some 20 dogs. They started hares, and thev started foxes, and they st%rted wolves; but all the 8006horsemen, with the dogs and the trumpeters, could never manage to run down one of them. In fact, they no more understand the chase than you understand what serfs are. Lastly, they had eagle hunting, in which a Khirgish carried an eaglo on hils fist, and then having started a fox, the eagle flew after him, but always missed him ; the chase never extended over more than 20 yards of ground." The hon. baronet next spoke of the immense size of the great bell in the courtyard of the Kremlin, 21 feet high, 22 feet in circumference, and weigbing 450.0001b., while our Great Torn of Lincoln only weighed 10,0001b,, and the greatest bell in France .i6,0001b. The Russian bell had never been raised, and when he asked a man why it had not been elevated he said it was too heavy, and when an attempt was made it broke the scaffolding and fell 100 yards into tho ground, " but with respect to this latter point," added Sir Robert, "nmy informant must have been mista,ken." (Loid laughter.) The hon. baronet next alluded to the battle of Borodino, when Napoleon's army of 120,000 nmen defeated a R,,s¢ian army of a like number, under Kutusoff, leaving 80,000 men dead on the field, and in vigorous language described his feelings as he gazed from Moscow upon the scene of the great contest. He went on to say, looking back to history, and contemplating the present position of the Russians, they could n.ot but feel that they were a brave people, who, under a better government and more liberal institntions, might become a mighty snd flourishing nation. " What I wish to impress upon you is," said Sir Robert, "that you should not throw away your money to improve the internal condition of a country which will turn the benefits you confer to their own advantage. (Cheers:) I know not whether I have afforded some little entertainment, but if I have I am well pleased, and shall be glad to devote my little abilities at any time to your service. I would close my observations with this sentiment, which cannot fail to be that of every one who hears me ;- great as Russia is, when I contemplate the power of my own country, I would ten thousand times sooner repose in the lap of Britannia the humblest citizen in the land than own the Ulgiance or bow the knee to the power that sways thesceptre in Russia." The hon. baronet resumed his seat amid vehement cheering, and the meeting shortly afterwards separated.
THE RESOLUTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your naval and military inteUigence of to-day informs us that it is said to be the "intention of the Admi. ralty to have the Resolute stripped and placed in ordinary."' This must be mere rumour. I can hardly believe that any. thing so ungracious is reaUy contemplated. Alow me t) suggest a better way of disposing of her. Let her be handed over, all standing, as a loan to the Crystal Palace Company, to be kept for public inspection in the piece of water at the bottom of their grounds. She is not so large but that the company would find means of transporting her, by canal and railway, across the bit of country between Deptford and Sydenham. Once there, she would prove a worthy object of attraction to Englishmen and Americans for years to come. There would be a visible memorial of the gaUantry and hardihood of the seamen of both nations, as well as of the brotherly feeling which prompted all hands in the search for poor Sir John Franklin. Drake's little ship, you remember, in which he sailed round the world, was, by Queen Elizabeth's orders, kept in Deptford Creek til she rotted, as & monument of his extwordinaryvoyage. Part of one of her timbers still existc somewhere. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. E A S. Jan. 6.
THE GRBBT FRAUDS ON THE CITY OF LORDON UNION. At 2 o'clock yesterday a very numerously attended meeting of the Board of Guardians connected with the City of London Union was held at the board-room in St. MIary-axe for the transaction of the ordinary business of the union, and receiving special reports upon the subject of the late frauds, one of which was from the accountant (Mr. Morgan), another from the committee of investigation, and two others from the Poor Law Board, copies of which will be found below. Mr. J. Taylor presided. The minutes of the last meeting having been read and The Clerk (pro tern), Mr. BAYLIS, said that the amount of cash in the hands of the bankers for the week current was 4,2041. 2s. 3d.; last week it was 3,5621. 6s. lid. ; the difference being 6411. 15s. 4d. THE RECET STATEMIENT OF MR. WHEELER AS TO SMITH, PAYNE, AN\D CO. In consequence of a report which appeared in some of the papers of Wednesday last, and in which it was alleged that Mfr. Wheeler, the guardian of St. Martin, Ludgate, had stated that the business of the union with reference to the accounts had been done in " a loose manuer," certain members of the investigation committee had thought fit to write a letter to The 2Times in defence of the firm. The result was, that yesterday Mr. Wheeler brought the subject before the board, with the view of justifying the statements he had made, and at the same time doing justice to the eminent firm to which he had alluded. He had not said, as the letter represented him to have stated, that he considered the board had any right to repudiate the sum of 3,0001 which had [been permitted to be overdrawn, but he did wish it to be understood that his recommendation was to the effect that before they did aUow it they should pause and take time to consider, as their treasurer was Mr. Samuel George Smith, of the firm of Smith, Payne, and Smith, and, of course, it was he (the treasurer), and not,the firm, who was responsible, and to whom he (Mr. Wheeler) alluded. (" Hear, hear," and "Oh,".) He considered that the treasurer, according to the terms of the act of Parliament, had not done his duty, for the instructional letter of the Poor Law Guardians with reference to the question of any deficiency in the funds distinctly charged the treasurer of the union to give notice thereof "in writing" to the Poor Law Commissioners. (Hiear, hear.) Mr. FINLAY wished to know the date of that order? The CHAIR3AN interposed.-If any one wished to say anvthing upon the question, or to ask any question of Mr. Wheeler while he was speaking upon a subject having reference to a breach of privilege, such question must be put at the close of the remarks the speaker might make. Mr. WIIEELEB continued.-He had not the shghtest doubt but if the regulations of the Poor Law Commissioners had been duly attended to that the extensive frauds ,which they had now discovered would have been found out long ago. He complained that he had not been informed of the complaint as to the statement he was alleged to have made before a letter, signed, not by the general members of the board, but by a portion of the investigation coimmittee, had been sent to the morning papers, an act which he considered to be one of great injustice to himself. (Hear.) As to the firm of Smith, Payne, and Smith, he never had uttered anything against their honour, respectability, or integrity; all he had said was that the proceedings as to the amount allowed to be overdrawn by their treasurer, Mr. Samael George Smith, were irregular, and, as he nowv said, contrary to 'he act of Parhament. It was a fact that he had said it was true that, before they could legally acknowledge Messrs. Smith and Payne's debt, it was questionable whether the firm could claim it legaUy, and that was why he asked them to pause before doinig so, but he denied in toto having used the word " repudiate," as it was stated that he had done. (" Hear," and " Oh !") He thought it right to himself and the board that he should give the explanation he had done. Mr. FI\LA%Y then explained, as did also MIr. MARSIHALL, who said that his impression was most distinctly that Mr. Wheeler's remarks upon a foriner occasion had reflected upon the conduct of the eminent firm of Smith, Payne, and CO. Mr. SINGER supported Mr. Wheeler. He (tr. Singer) thought, from what that gentleman stated, that he meant the treasurer had not attended to the duties laid down for him by the Poor Law Commissioners, and therefore he (M. Singer) had considered Mr. W heeler to be justified in not wishing the board to acknowledge the clain of Messrs. and Co., until the same had been fully inAfter same further conversation, Mr. CoRnEwra moved, and Mr. Arm.ess seconded, the following, which was carried unanimously, viz:- " That this board having heard from MIr. Wheeler an explanation of the words used by him on Tuesday, the 30th ult., are willing to believe that he did not irntend to recommend a repudiation of the debt due to Zmssrs. Smith Payne, and Smith, as was understood by the board; and, further, that this board re anxious to make known their hgh sense of the great liberality of Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith, in connexion with the money accounts of Mr. ELLIOTT, one of the guardians, then entered into a long statement with reference to certain rumours respecting himself and the recent frauds, during the course of which he stoutly denied any knowledge of or participation in any designs or transactions of an improper character; after which, Mr. BAVyLIS read "THE REPORT OF ITHE INVRETI:ATJON COINITTEE ON THE RECENT FR.tt >S. "Your committee beg to report that immediately after the adjournment of the board on Tuesday last they proceeded witn their inquiries, and while so doing informa'tion reached them that John Paul was in custody, when two of your committee proceeded to the police-station in Bisbopsgate-street to identify him. On their return to St. Maryaxe they at once communicated with Mr. Humphreys, who met them at 10 o'clock the next morning, and: rranged as to what measures should be taken, and what witnesses should be in attendance at the Mansion-house to prove the charges of forgery and felony against Paul. " On WVednesday, shortly after 120o'clock, John Paul was placed at the bar before the Lord Mayor, when Mr. Hum.pheys appeared in support of the charge brought against fim- '., the forgery of a paper purporting to be a receipt 290., paid to the treasurer of the union, and the stealing of a check for 3871. 15s. fd., drawn by the board for the payment of Mr. Kingsford, one of your contractors, but which check Paul paid in to nis own bankers, the Bank of London, and thus appropriaVd it to his own use. "After hearing the charges and the evidence the Lord Mayor remanded Paul till Thursday next, at 12 o'clock. " Letters have been received from the Poor Law Board, dismissing Charles Guerrino Manini from his office as col. lector for this union, and informing the Board of Guardians that their resolution to disniiss John Paul, J. G. Eldred, and George Hampton does nmt require conifirmation by the Poor Law Board, they being only assistant-clerl, kwp therefore suggest the propriety of f-hese persons being paid up to the 25th of M[arch next, antl leaving forthwith. Messrs. Yarnall and Carre having been directed by the Poor Law Board to investigate the cases of your clerk and auditor, we suggest the propriety of waiting the result of that investigation before any permanent assistance be engaged, as we uave full confidence that Mr. Baylis wiUl take care that the current business gets into no confusion. The accounts of the present quarter will be entered in new boo'ss, the old ones being under the control and examination of Mr. Mlorgan, the accountant. "<Mir. Morgan is anxiously proceeding with his arduous task of investigating the accounts from Lady-day, 155, and we therefore merely refer you to the accompanying statements received from Mr. Morgan. "W We regret also to say that in the accounts delivered by your tradesmen and contractors there is scarcely one in connexion with which some fraud does not appear to have been committed by Paul. The severs! cases will, we think, demand the strictest investigation before they aro paid. ",It appears to your committee that the most imnortant topic at present is the proposed investigation by the officers of the Poor Law Board as regards 14r. ltowsell and the auditor, and we suggest the propriety of this being entirely independent of that of your committee Our opinions are a eady bfore you, and, while we see no reason to alter them, we do not desire that they shall in any way prejudice or limit the official inquiry. It appears obvious to us that ' the means by which these frauds have been effected' are simply tbese-that Paul and 3Manini have been allowed for many years to place, or cause to be placed,to the credit of any accounts they pleased, sums of any amount, without such sums having been received by the treasurer, and that checks drawn by the board for payment of its debts have been illegally allowed to be used by Paul, without the slightest supervision or check either by the chairman, clerk, or auditor. 'We have only to state, in conclusion, that we have been anxiously engaged in investigating several cases of fraud by Paul, and instructing Mr. Hl{mphrc-ys therein. ei, "AlU which we beg to report to the board." The report was then received, and ordered to be entered upon the board minutes. The folowing was then read, alUsion having been made thereto in the previous document: "REPORT OF TITE ACCO-NT,ANT ON THER FRAUDS. "To the Investigation Committee of the City of London Union. " 51, St. Mary-axe, Jan. 5. "Gentlemen,-I have commenced my examination from the 25th of March, 1855, agreeably to your instructions, but, as there is no authentic cashbook-, I have been obliged to extract from the bankers' passbook all the items of receipt and expenditure. "TThlbalance brought forward in the general ledger, zs remaining in the hands of the treasurer on the 25th of March, 1855, was 4,7421., 2s. ad., while, in fact, the bankers' account was overdrawn at that time to the extent of 1,724L 17s. Sd., making a difference between these two statements of 6,4671. Os. 2d. This, however, does not constitute the total discrepancy between the treasurer's account in the general ledger and the bankers' passbook, as I find that sums amounting to 11,0571. 14s. 8d. were paid subsequently to the 26th of March, and this amount will therefore re- e,re to be added. The real difference is 17,5241. 14s. lOd. The cashbook does not agree with either of these amounts. " The general ledger appears to have been concocted with extraordinary precision, but there is no proof that the figures have been derived from any authentic source. The parish ledger also appears to be incorrect, and the two cashbooks differ so widely from each other that, althounh both may have been fabricated from the bankers' passbooK, it will be unsafe to rely on the figures contained in either of them. "I am ouly on the threshold of the inquiry; it must, erefore, be understood that my observations are of a preliminary character. " I remain, gentlemen, your obedien.t servant, "HENRY LLOYD MORGANP. The Cmustr,i then 8aid,-Gentlemen, we have received two very important communications from the Poor Law Board, which Mfr. Baylis will read. (Hear, hear.) The following are copies of them :- "Poor Law Board, Whitohall, Jan. 3. '"Sir,-I am directed by the Poor Law Board to acknow- ledge the receipt of your letter of the 3Ist ult., forwarding a copy of the report of the committee appointed by the ;guardians of the City of London Union to investigate the xguesRiatt proveediaes of certain ofle.> Qf the union, and stating that the recommendations which the report contains have been adopted by the guardians. ' I am directed to inform yon that, having carefully considered this report, the board concur in the recommendation of the guardians, that Mr. Manini, the collector of poorrates, who It appears has absconded, should be immediately removed from his office. The board ,,n accordingly issue under their hands and seal the necessary order for this purpose. " Messrs. John Paul, George Hampton, B. G. Eldred, and John Hawse, being only 'assistant-officers,' it is competent to the guardians themselves, in the exerciso of their discretion, unader article 188 of the General Orders dated the 24th of July, 1847, to dismiss them from their respective offices, and the board entertain no doubt that the guardians will take that course which the justice of the case and the interests of the union may seem to them to require. " With respect to Mr. Rowssell, the clerk to the guardians, and Mr. Gibbs, the district auditor, the board deem it necessary that a special inquiry should be held by two of their inspectors into that portion of the report of the commnittee which affects the conduct of the above-named officers. The board have accordingly instructed Mr. FarnaU and Mr. Cane to institute this inquiry, which will he held wtthout any unnecessary delay. The charges preferred against Mr. PovscUl and MIr. Gibbs, and others connected with the affairs of the City of London Union, will then be fUly investigated, and their continuance in or removal from offlce will depend upon the result of the evidence which may be adduced. "1 ama, Sir, your obedient servant, ." . W. GRFY, Secretary. O MTo . A. J. Baylis, Acting Clerk to the Guardians of the City of London Union, 51, St. Mary axe." " Poor L-aw Board, Whitehall, January 3. Sir,-I am instructed by the Poor Lavv Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., in which you transmit to them a copy of a resolution passed by the guardians of the City of London Union, proposing to empower their Investigation Committee to borrow of Messrs. Smith, Payne, a nd Co. the sum of 5,0001., to be repaid with interest in two years. " The board observe that it is not stated either in the resolution or in the letter for what purposes the guardians require the proposed loan. Umless it be required for some purpose expressly authorized by the statute, the board appear to be under the necessity of stating that tho guardians ave no legal power to effect the proposed loan, and to charge the repayment of it upon the poor-rate; and that under no circumstances can they lawfuUy delegate to a committee of their body the power of effecting a loan on their behalf. It is almost useless for the board to add that they are not empowered to sanction the guardians in obtaining a loan which the law does not justify them in procuring. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "T .. W. GR£LV, Secretary. To A. J. Baylis, Esq., Clerk (pro t7n.) to the Guard-ans of the City of London Union, 51, St. Mary-axe." The reading of this correspondence being finished, MIr. FAR.NALL stated that it was his intention to proceed in the official inquiry as soon as pos8ible, ia accordance with the instructions he had received from the Poor Law Commissioners, and, accordingly, arrangements for that purpose were made with the consent of the board. Mr. WVEBIER (Common Councilman) wished to know whether there was any truth in a statement which had appeared, to the effect that 72 of the guardians had resigned in consequence of the investigation and the frauds now goin ons The Csc£UAasi~.-I do not know of a single resignation. The board then broke up.
THE ACCIDENT TO THE POIATT OF A YR LIFEBOAT. LIVERPOOL, JAtS. 6. The greatest cominisseration is felt in the town for the widows and families of the unfortunate men whlo were drowned off the WVelsh coast in the late storm, while themselves proceeding to the assistance of a vessel in distress. Subscriptions are hei made towards a general fund for their reief, to vwhich the mercantile classes and the shipowners are contributing with liberality, This morninr, Mr. Buchanan, cottonbroker, levied a contribution of I. each from his brother cottonbrokers on 'Change, the full amount thus obtained being 1301. This afternoon a meeting of the members of the Underwriters' Association was held in the room over the Exchange News-room. The Mayor (Mr. Francis Shand) presided, and there was a numerons attendance of the leading merchants and gentlemen of the town. The MAYoR, in introducing the object of the meeting, stated that nine of the 13 unfortunate nmen who were drowned had left widows and families. The loss of so many hves thus suddenly was at all times to be seriously lamented, but when the catastrophe was consequent upon the humane effor's of these unfortunate men in proceeding to the relief of vessels in distress the event appealed stiU more to their sympathies. Mr. ROBERT wy.\? said he had that morning received a letter from a county magistrate, who described the wrecked lifeboatmen as very worthy, decent people, a statement which, from his own knowledge, he could ratify. Mr. C. TuRvuER, chairman of the Liverpool Dock Committee, observed that the men were bold and fearless and earnest servants of the Dock Committee. The Point of Ayr lifeboat, he believed, had been out more than any other in the service, in consequence, perhaps, of the station being more witlhin call than any other. There were no further particulars of the accident than those which had been publshed, and he did not see that there could be, as the upsetting of the boat was not witnessed by any one. Three men were seen on the boat after she capsized, but they were washed away by the aea The last occasion of a similar accident to a hfeboat in the service of the Dock Committee was in 18.36, when the Formby lifeboat upset and five men were lost. Seven bodies had been washed ashore. Afrer some further observations, the secretary (Mfr. T. Cort) took the names of gentlemen desiring to contribetc, and in a few minutes upwards of 300. was, represented. The following are among the principal contributions :-The ?Mayor, 101.; MIr. Robert Wynne, 201 - M1r. W. Tyrer, 20L.; Messrs. Jones, Palmer, and Co., i0O.; Messs Taylor, Potter, and Co., 201.,; Mr. C. Turner, 10,; Mr. Hubback, 101.; Mr. Frederick Lyon, 10; Mesmrs.

A vote of thanks to the Mayor, for presiding, terminated tho proceedings.
THE EARTHQUAKE IN CRETE. TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES. Sir,-I do myself the honour to enclose an official statement of the injury to life and property in this island from the severe earthquake which took place on Sunday morning, the 12th of October. The particulars havo already appeared in your jonunal and therefore it is needless to repeat them here. The misery occasioned by this catastrophb is very great, and the sufferers are fit objeots for the charity of their fellow-men. If you would kindly advocate their cause in your journal, possiblg some persons maight be induced to subscribe something towards their relief, which would, I am sure, be most gratefully accepted. WVith many upologies for intruding ouyoourvaluabloetime, I have the honou r to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. H. S. ONGLEY. Canea in Crete, Dec. 9, 1S56.

THE LATE GALES. The gales which burst forth with such fury along the coast on Saturday night and Sundaycontinued with violencel tip to yestetday morning. Throughout the whole of Monday night a terrific gale from tho N.E. to N.N.E. swept the North Sea and the, upper part of the English ChanneL Among the many, casualties that have happened it is feared must be enume. rated that of the total loss of the Royal Mail (Continental)Steam Packet Company's steamer Violet or her passage on, Monday night from Ostend to Dover. The Violet, it appears, left Ostend harbour with the Belgian mails on board, between 7 and 8 o'clock on Monday evening, and w,as due at Dover at midnight. No tidings have been heard, of her. At daybreak yesterday morning a fisherman saw a; wrecked vessel on the outer edge or southern spit of theGoodwin, but in consequence of the fearful sea that raged. round it he conld not approach near enough to ascertain more clearly the character and size of the unfortunatevessel. Her foremast wns still standing, and it was evident that she had struck on the sand during the night. Lloyd's- agent, at Ramsgate, it appears subsequently obtained otherinformation, and in the course of yesterday he telegraphed to Lloyd's that a vessel was on the Goodwin, supposeUto ho the Ostend mail-steamer. This and her absence, coupled, with the fact that the wreck lies nearly in the track, within. two or three miles, of the mail steamers, course between the' two ports, leaves very little doubt that the vessel was the Violet, and that not a single person on board was spared. She was counmanded by Captain Lyne, one of the most experienced masters on the station, and manned bv a crewof 17 hands. The company have reason to believe that she. had very few passengers on board. The wreck lies to the southward of the beacon, and within a mile or so of Dover Those connected with the trade infer that Captain Lyne had reached that spot about midnight, when it is supposed that he encountered the heavy snowstorm, and in the midst of it unhappUy the ship got on the sand. There were other disasters in the vicinity of the Downs The Reliance, Mr. Dixon, master, which only left theThames a few days since, with a valuable cargo of merchandise, was driven ashore by the gale near Walmer Castle. The lifeboat was promptly put off, and succeeded in taking off the crew. Off the North Foreland the Vic. tory lugger, belonging to Margate, was struck by a heavysea, and atmost immediately went down, with all handspoor fellows who had put off to render aid to vessels in dis. tress. A large American ship, the Northern Belle, of New York, had a narrow escape of being cast ashore near the North Foreland. The main and mizen masts were cut away, which eased her, and she held to her moorings. Off Sunderland, on Monday, the gale continued from the E.N.E., with snow. Nine vessels are reported to have gone ashore by the overwhelming force of the gale. Near the South Point, the Aurora, a schooner, of Goole, a short distance to the northward of the harbour, foundered, and, it is feared, with the whole of the crew. On Yarmouth Beach upwards of 12 coUiers and coasterswere driven by the force of the storm, and stranded. The crews were saved. At Lowestoft the losses were nearly as numerous. On Monday morning, at break of day, a brig was discovered on the Corton beach, and, on the Coastguard proceeding to the spot, they found one poor fellow, whoturned out to be the master, Captain HIunter, who had been washed ashore on the tiller to which lie had lashed himself. He was in a dreadful state and shockingly bruised, and it is doubtful whether he will survive the injuries he has sustained. The wreck proved to be that of the brig Peggy, of lVhitby, and all thecrew, vwith the exception of the master, perisRhed. Several coasters were cast ashore at Grimsby, and in one instance, the brig Fifteen, of North Shields, the master was washed overboard. Thero was a terrific gale on the north-east coast on Sun. day, resulting in the destruction of a vast amount of property and loss of human lifo.. About 10 o'clock a schooner was making for Hartlepool Harbour, andv when about halE amileoff was struck by two heavy seas,andimmediately sank with aU on board. In tho afiernoon a light brig met with the same fate near the same spot. Between 1 and 2 o'clock a beavily.laden schooner passed the end of theLongsecar Block, which it is supposed she struck, when she herself was struck by aheavy sea, and instantly went down with all hands. A dismasted brig, the Mary, of Colchester, drove ashore on the north sands about 4 o'clock. The rocket apparatus and the lifeboat were conveyed to tho spot, and, a line having been thrown over the brig, the lifeboat was hauled to her by its means, and the crewv saved. At 9 o'clock the bark Jovers Dolorense, of Ipsuich, drove upon the rocks near tho new pier. Tho crew were taken out by means of the rocket apparatus. The brig Era, of Rochester, drove ashore near Blackhalls, with mainmast gone; the crew were saved by means of the rocket apparatus. A portion of a Duteh galliot, supposed to be the Eidendensho, washed ashore near the same place. In the harbour o£ West Hartlepool several vessels are sunk, having struck the north pior on their en. tering the harbour, and sunk almost immediately. The foUowring are their names :-Pandora, Hunt; 7Zephyrus, Franke; George IV., Plylus; Severn ; Lady Aberdeen-all from London, in ballast. Seaton beach, near Seaton Carew, is strewed with tho fragments of vssels, axmong which are the Hebbert, Ainsloy i the Empress, Smith; the Chance, Foreman ; the Jubilee, Damr; and tho Ayrcs, Chade. On midleton beach are the Native, Buck; the Nymph, Cleet ; the Union, Choat; and the Duke, BaiUie. Cardiff was visited by a te rrific galo early on Saturday morning. It blow from the north-west, and caused considerable damage to property. Two houses were blown down in the Bute-road. A largo hole is in the roof of St. John's Church, caused by some heavy substance falling on it. The roof of a blacksmith's houso at the docks was completely blown off; a houLso was also blown down near the town, and a part of a house at Mtr. Morgan's, chymist, High-street. A house near tho Taff tale Rsilway works was blown down, and several trees were tom up by the roots. Signboards were blown away, tiles were flying over the heads of the pas,qers-by, women were thrown to the ground with great violence, but fortunately no personal injury was done. Towards evening the gale abated, untU Sunday evening, when it again increased, and more danage wvas done, The gales continued at Shields with fury aU Sunday night, but abated on Monday forenoon. There is now no dvubt from the wrecks that have been cast upon the beach that the schooners Alma, of Rye, and the Reform perished on Sunday rmorning, about three miles to the northward of Tynemouth-lighthouse, with all hands. The South Shields lifeboat reached Shiclds-harbour after dark on Sunday with the crew of the Active of Winstaple, which they had allantly rescued from among the broken wrater on the Herd sand, where the vessel had boen wrecked. The Shieldspilots deserve all honour for the heroism they displayed in the storm. There has been a considerable fall of snow in the county of Northumberland. The accounts of the wrecks in the storm south o' Shields are fearful. Five vesseIs were observed on Sunday morning to go down off the Heugh light the souther.most promontory on tho Durham coast, and all bands perished. A large dismasted brig came ashore on the Longscar rocks without any one on board. A west-country schooner has been wvrecked on the rocks at the mouth of the Tyne; her crew were saved by the lifeboat. Tho bng Stour, of Colchester, ran on shore on the north side of the Tvne, on a rcef known as the Black Midden on Monday. Tho crew were rescued by the lifeboat. The name of the French lugger on tho Herd Sand is tho Alexes Picro Amie, of Caon. The brg Riesi is onshore at Sun. derlaud; the crew are saved. The captain reports that he observed a vessel go down with a llhands in the offing, The vessels on the Herd Sand are very much broken up by the violence of the storm. A number of sailing vessels and steamers are detained in the Tyne.
THE REPORTED LOSS OF THE MAIL PACKET VIOLET. TO TEE EDITOR OF TE; TLMES. Sir,-I beg to send you the latest intetligenc received -with respect to the loss of a mail packet off the Goodwin Sands. "Ramsgate, Monday Evening. "One of the mail packets, stPpposed from Ostend, was lost off the Goodwin Sands last night-all hands drowned. Three bodies found attached to a life-buoy wreck lie on the Sands." In the absence of more positi*e information it is impossible to say that the mail packet referred to is actually the Violet. In consequence of the derangement of the sub. marine electric telegraph cable we have no report of her departure from Ostend on Monday afternoon, but I have reason to believe that the loss is that of the Violet, for she was due at Dover with the mails from Ostend on Monday night at 12 o'clock, and up to a late hour this eve N she had not arrived. The Violet, 300 tons and 128 horse-power, was one of the best and strongest packets on the station. She was builtfor the Admiralty, and was commanded by an officer (Mr. Lyne) who had been in the service a great many years. His chief officer (Mr. Paul) held a mastes certificate, and the quartermaster held a chief.matos certificate. In fact, the officers and men (17) wero of the oldest and most experienced in the service and on the station. In addition to the crew a Post-office mail guiard was on board, and at this time of the year the number of passengers amounted to about five orsix. It is, of course, impossible to suggest any other cause of this fearful and distressing calamity than the blinding anaL paralyzing inflaence of the drifting snow gale. I am, Sir, yours, &c., J. G.
