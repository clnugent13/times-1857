GENERAL SIR CRARLEg YAPIE',S OPlElONS.* The four volumes recently published by Sir William Napier are intended, as will be gathered 4om,1 tAQiS6 ;t,-3 .= .t-* life, bbutaso of the opinioari oEi his' brother.- With Imuechtlht was eccentrio in his'tjle, raid that gave to' these opimions an air, sometimes of flippancy, 1oiutinmes of wrong6eadednbes; with very muoh,too, in the manuer of urgiEg his views upon others, -that waA Po offenAve a5 to be effectual only in ;exoltingopposition auda diglist, it is undeniable that d;Uharlei Xapier was X man of keen observation *6nd shrewd sense, that he saw further than most 4nen; that he was exceediugly fertiel in idea, and h.tlhe was often very happy in contrivance. The piriotis of asch a man, if they are not to be-accepted implicitly, xre 'still worthy of consideration, esp: ly since we find. that predictions of his utte'ed ten.y6ears ago, involving the safety'of our' Indian' Umpire, at the tine neglected by those in authority, re nowtverified'to the letter. and to our deep disgrace,; If anythibg can more 'clearly illustrate the sense of security in irhich Indian official; in spite *of all warnings, have indulged; it is that at the"very time when this alarning mutiny was about to. ,rst forth in the, Bengal Presidency it was ACtull proposed so to remodel the crininljusdiotion of the countryas to Subject the few Englsh,en scattered over ,andostan to the anomalies of 3:ative law; to the tyrarnies of nativewitnesses, who fora!few annas will swear away the lives of their -esret frtends; to the ignorance of native jurv.men, .who donot evenunderstanduthe value of trial by .jury; and to the tendeir mercies of ntative magis$rates, armed with a power of summazy jurindictlon iuikti~no even' in 'England; and by me.ans of which a- ,,European might be confined in their vile prisons viaR the fierce heat of 4Indis, foi so' much as y'io years. This proposa, to which we invited the attention of our readers not many weeks ago, will certainly never pass into law, if, even without our recent experience, it ever had a chance of being accepted. But the fact *h-at the .Indian Government contemplated suoh a 1a&w, the very mention of which threw theEnglish inhabitants of Calcutta into-coistetnition; shows-how completely they ignored' the antagonism of race and the iufl i- ences of caste, which-' the Ipresent mutiny has revealed, and how' lazily they smokred the pipe of peace upon groand that .was strewn with powder. Amid all this calmuess and fancied security the voices of Napierpr nd otls,r s,iere heard soundlng'an alarm. 'Sir'Charles Na-pier; liowever, did not merely wamn us of danger; he gaie us advice bywhieh,he deemed that danger 3might be a'voided; and ,at the .present important junctureitmaybe useful as a postscript to our notices of his liff to give an abstrad of I*is opinions wvith regard to Indian affair:- INDIAN POs.iCAL SYSTEM. "The India system seems to be the crushing of the Dative-plebeian and supportiDg the aristocrat, who reason nnd facts el usis our deadly enemy. lemustaiways be, for we tep iuto is plioes; he descends un the Sale of acciety andw stand onihiz head. The ryot iS ruined by us, thougn willing to be our friend. Yet he isthe na-to .whom we must trust for keeping- India, and the enly one .who cantake it from us it we ill-us him, for he then joins iris hated natral chief. The final result of our Indian conquests no man can predict; but if we take the pco4le by 'ith hand w-e may count en ruling India for ages. J^ustice, rigid justice. even severe justice, will wvork niracles-.st has I zals in the desire Qf man for protection agains cruelty, and caunot be shalc. India s- safe if so ruled. zuch deeds re. doae as make me wonder that we hold it "TewoeIsNDUwSTYrx or 3Busnpss. - "The ihole style of the civil and militpy correopondence In Indi is bad and vulgr, and not business.like. Instead of pith, half a sheet Is nlled with titles and references and dates, where . Horse Guards' letter would at once touch the sub'ect; and,when you wade through this stuff yon come to othing comprehensible at last, and you have then to refer to other letts for explanation ofthe one in your hand." , SovBc, Xor Arn 1m3 Evm. greatest evil is the army doing. the civil work, hile a.n imrmense civil army does noing but plunder the bud; it zrins the regolararuy, and so places everythinag in danger; ourarmny is deteriorating w-hile the natives are nmtroving I fewv, ears ago there was not a firearm iai India nat h,ad not a matchlock; the ot,her day In tho Robat defile we didjiot take one!* All were flintlocks, and the native ances now shoot w,ith ,detonators. fhese are seemingly small inattere, but sigs,N of thetinies." ,I,XADN CIVIL BxnvIc. One of the great evil5 in India, safar as I can perceive, Is that everf'head of an office faciZes himself a gentleman, who is to amuse himself and sign paper; presented byhis clerks; and they, gradualy. gettng better coatson, 'v, tbemselves gntlemen't6o. Of course more clerks are re- rd, nd arge establishmerets are formed without *eason. en eombal scized'thelGovernment of Lisbon he found 2,0001 clerks; he cat the thouaands'down to 200. This has always appeared to me a lemson well sated to India,4where young gentlemenof the clvil service have aservmnt t wash tn'ery distnct toed'. - 'Ihave i6t in 20 montlm done what could be done if I remained; but having no real power I could only give a vigotous tone to the army,- which' it-had in a great degree lost.. Next to tone I ought tD have drawn the cords of dis ciplineanddrill tight, but could not without timeandu campe of instruction, neithdr of which could I obtain. But efore I could improve disciplEne the troos must havo been Jfreed from the oppressnive civil du.ties imposed on them. 'Uatil this isdoneno0 good eanibedone; entilapolicoeis formed no good can he done; t he troUops all go tDShe devil en these duties." THE GtREs 'ETxAY'Evm. "The great military evil of India which strikes me is this. All the old officers get snug places, and regiments are left to boys. The 8th Native Iantry wore on parade for inspection last week 800 strong, and there were only three offcers, of whom two had not been dismised drill I This Will not do; the men look to-the native officer; and he, teaching the Saheb, naturaly looks upon him as his puil not his master. Some day evil will arise from all ths. If-1 had a voice I would insist upon field officers being with their regiments and not holding civil situations, at least not -wore than one field officer and one captain being away on civil employments. That officers' do civil dduties far better than civil servants I have not the slightest doubt, but then there o fght to henmore o fcers. SirThomas bMunro, I hear, dethought three officers w ore nfficient for reguent. This is hign authority, yet I canfess to thinkig him vrong; or else, which is vey possible, the state of the Ermy and sthle of officer have changed-not altogether Letter nor altogether worse, but become di taerent." SK\ETC OF IDIDAN ARM.- "The general framewvork of 'this army iqsbad. The oflicers appear better staff officerasthaneors, but as regimental fflicers worse. There 'is nothig I can remedy as a majorgeneral; plentf that should be quickly arranged were I Commander.in.Cliefm People here arenfull of the superiority ef Eur,opeans, which s regards the soldiers is perhaps true. I have not seen the others fght. But the mstake & this. the former European ofmcer 'was there bs comin arde headed, daringdfeltowho taught indtformedthe Sepoy-tho CWires, Laurences, Bossys, &c. The present European is a youngster who makes curry, drinks champagne, and avoids easun; ine 0lor s 2years, iE he hash rains and health, he acquies some knowuledge and is put on the staff; thus the anduents are constanty commanded by lieutenants. ve this moment a troop of horse artillery here is commanded The a cadet of 15, 'who came out with mce, and ahom I periled by asking himn what thedispart of a gun was!f "eWhile thi deterioratton of the European goes on the mative officer seems to actuire a higher grade in general estination, because fro want of European offcers the young and ignorant command nominally, while the natives, ever at their posts, re the real officers and very good onesntoot 'There isa gread eryfor more regimental officers, because the fewv there are have more work than they like; but no one oeems to foresee that your young inexperienced wild cadet ill oame daryiind the nudian oytaken out of his hands bry the Sonhaiars, who are men of high caste andtvery Oaring. Many have got orders of merit for noble actions. The Soubadars are steady, respectful, thoughtful, sternlooking men, very zealous and very miiiy, th an atiructers of all our soldiers." ca te o pean PnriDrCrrONr OF Mu'rriry N TnE INDIA AfrtY " Old Indians say, ' There is no re.spect for you in Iudia 'Without magnificence and showF.' A greater fallacy does not ast. Trumerysa2d huinug are our eneroles in lndia,ass they weres ana re the enemiesof the bsrhatic Princes. Such folly ruined them and wrill ruin ns, for if we continue to Imitate the Eastern style our officers wdll deteriorate, and the native oflicersv'ill take the em',ire from u.A radical reform of the Indian army and an increase of European fficrsis bslutlyncessary.

R ATION OP OsFiCn AND PBiVATr, " Among the modern military changes there is one which has been gradualy introduced in a number of regiments by gentlemen who are usually called 'martinets'-not soldeis, only martinets, who wouldnot let a poor soldier eat his dinner his owu'way, if they could help it. The innovation is that of prohibiting a'prrvate soldier addressdng his officer unless in-. flU uniform and accompanled bya noncommissioned officer, also full dressed! This Is a very dangerous innovation, it is digging a ditch between' the officersand their men! THow are Company's officers to study men's characters when no man dare address them but in full dress and in presence of a non-commissoned offlcer? This system injures the feeling of respect and-affeetion towards officers. The spirit of aristocracy is strong in the soldiers; they respect and honour their offeers generally; but these martinets who leave nothing to huma nature, who would make them blow their noses by 'beat of drumD produce disgust at the service."

Very politic was the plan of these relioious men. High pay interested all caste4, and was a coverng bait; but their under-machinery was by rei}gions inflaence to bar recruiting if the mutineers were isbanded, and use their banded strength if retained in pay Charles Napleres ready genius at once seized the means of affling this scheme with one more deeply lid, morallT andphysically-na3nely,augmentingtheGhoorlm battalions, as he proposed to Lord Dalhousie, snd giving them Sepoy pay andadvantages. He could thus ovetafe the mutineers with a rival army of men, more hardy, stronger of bodr, even braver, and of lest prevaricating fait,:as having fewver prejudices to wound; thus also he designed to convince the Branin that their influence to stop reorhiting would be futile agais the Government, hurtful only to themselves, and must therefore be abandoned." These extracts contain the sum of Sir Charles Napier's -opinions regarding the 1Indian army. Nothning important; has been omitted. Whether sound or not, his viewrs are at all events suggestive, and, supposing his representations to be correct, it is difficulti to understand how such a state of things should have been sO long permitted. Accustomed as we are to much mismanagement at; homes the picture of the Indian army wrhich Sir Charles Napier paints thus vividly, and which the events of the last few montKhs go far to verify, is a chaos which might have startled into something like contentment even those who gazed uponall themudof Balaklava. It will be obsered that our extracts are chie3fy descrptire of the regimental system of the Indian army. We might have quoted passages that comment in most severe terms on the Commissariat, Ordnance, and Transport Departments; but these are only accessornes to an army, accessories indeed that are essential to its uxistence, and that, badly mcanaged, cost us a most splendid body of troops in. the Crimea, but still not sO important as the constitation of the army itself. There in some hope for an army that is only tur-fed and badly equipped; but an army without officers and writhout discipline is ahunly a mob. It is worse, it i8s a anrmed mob. How isit we may well ask, thasmatters have beesn allowedto come to such a paass? owlit that warn.ings were so long neglected, and that Napier, irascible and unconciliating though ho was, came to be treated as a meddling old fool? o, abs we believe, Sir Cha;rles did not go the right way to work, .till the facts were pcatent, nnd, in spite of Sir Wilsiam Gommi's asseferation that when he surrendered his commcand he left the Pengal army in a "bperfectly healthy state of discipliine" we are com;.elled to the conclusion that the troops were fasi pening to revolt. Surely the very ignorance of danger is but one more evidence i of that separation of interest between officer and Sepoy of which m Sir Charles Napier complained; our sexnde of security isbut the last convincing proof of* disorganioatian. The remedy that has been proposed in our present diffculty-namely, to disband the Sepoy regiments, and to depend more upon Her Majesty's troops in conjunction with the Irregular corps-hasthe merit of simplicity, and would certainly for a time at least be effective. Yet before we consent altogether to dismiss the Sepoy, who has been at once so much landed and so much vituperated, it may be well to think of the antidote suggested by Napier. 'What right have we I to expect that under a similar regunental system 'the Beloochee,- the Punjabee, or the Ghoorka wil prove more faithful than the Sepoy ? WVhat right havewe to expect that the Sepoy, whom'wehavenot taught to respect his officers, will obey heknowsnot what, he knows not why? By all means enlist the b vAve and hardy mountaineers into our service; but that is n6 re? ;on why we should altogether dispense 'with theBzahmnin -who, if properly'trained and treated, Is not unworthy of serving- with British troops. The recruiting of these mountaineers will lower the conceit of the Sepoys, wiU introduce a proper balance into the Indian army; but the most important work of all bad still to be accomplished. Such a regimental system as Sir Charles Nfapier has described w-ould'rui3n the best troops in the world.

Sir CulHlng Eaidley was busy always'and everywhere look." ug after thecomfortof his guests, and the day passed off. without a single contrdemps to maritsgeneral hilarity. After this briefnotice of the gala, it 'may'not be out of pLace'to say i few wordi regatdink its gres.% k6asion, the cable itself, and the arrangements for Enbmerging it. The Agamemnon is still moored off the wharf at Glasse and Elliot's yard, though this afternoon, with the ebb of the spring tide, she commences her -voyage to Sheerness. There her compasses will be adjited, as she is too deep In the water to be swung at Green-hithe. At present she has anything but a sightly aspe6t, the'great deadweight of the cable and the Tather-'ponderous appliances for pyilng it ott having altered her trim appearance for the worse. To approach her from the yard is neither an easy nror a 'cleanly task, and the visitor, howaver cautious, will ascertain- beyqnd a doubt that the old maxim, that one cannot touch pitch and not be defiled is strictly true with regard to tar. Th wire, as we have slready explained in previous notices,' has been Wound over the floating stages from the wharf into the hold of the vessel. The machine by which -this Wss done registered each fAthom,n furlong, a*d mile as - it; pawed, while the usual axpaiatus wah '-employed to test the integrity of- the conducting -wire.

If weo-are not misin. formed, the heat of the sun destroyed many miles of the wire by incitng 'out the gntta percha while the cable wa3 lying in Glasseo and Elliot's yard. -Proper precrations .should be taken- to avert rik from this point. -We have alrehdy exbIained to our readers how the cable is coated with closily woven piral *ires, to prevent damage to tho core ini piying 'out; but, in conrsquence of thetwo halves having been made at different plces-oreo at Birkenhead, by Messrs. Newall, ail the othei atrt Greenwich, by Glasse ' and Elliot, -a most egregious blunder has been committed. Itn Wi scarcely ba credited, but it is nevertheless true, that the twist ofthe spiral wires of the Birkenhead half -isin exactly the opposite' direction to the twist of the' *ires in the half made ea Greenwich. Thus, when joined-in the centre of theAtlantic they wil form a right hand and a left hand screw, and the tendency of each will 'be to assist the other to untwist, ind expose the co'e5 -y attaching a solid weight to the cenftre - joinl 'it-is hoped this difflic6tj and danger may be overcoiic, but none attempt to conceal that the mistake is much to bc iegretted. Weareinformed that Messrs. Glasse and Elliot had nearly 100lmileslof their portion of the cable completed before Messrs. Kvviallcom-enced theirs, and that therefore the fault rcsts withothe firrn which began list. ; i The apparatus to ibo used in paying out the ca'bl is alio looked upon by engineers ' as very il adapted to its pur - pose. With a cable of auch-extreme lightness and no-greak# strength, and attached to a vessel like the Agamemnon' the sllghtest'possible check or hitch occurring' would pia it like a thread. The friction drums should therefore have been of the slightest kind consistent with preventing a " rnsh," and In fact only suflicient to ease it over gently. .Yet it is no exaggeration to say that the ma'chinery to be used is the ery reverse of all this, and its massive aspect strikes dismay into every well-;wisher to-the 'scheme. Some of the firstengi neers of the iay consider it too heavy, and haveeipressed7 most urifavouraible opinions concerning it and Its! -probable effects upon the cable; and even thosel intimately connected with the plan and its details do not disguise their regret that suchl a machinery should be resoried to.' It consists bf fonr pulleys or Iron wheels, about sa feet diameter, with very deep fauges or Vgrodrest inwhich the cabtawili rest. rouand two wheels tho cable] w1il be wound twice, and round two wheels once, so as to form' two figures of 8. As if the friction of this were not enough, each wheel is connected with smvasive toothed wheels, and the motion of. all made equa1 at the - expese of a iroportionafe strain on the ,cable Incase of a fault or kink going overboard theio is an auxiliary apparatus, consistng of two wheels, round each of whichthe cable will be wound five times. These will be worked by sa small engine placed immediately beneath, so that, if ne4ces=sary, a portion of the cable can be hauled in again an the klink-or fault remedied. The machine which works' this can also be made to turn the wheels over'which the cable passes,if their friction should be thought too much for its strength ; 'but, though this will lessen the strain In paying out, it increases the kink froia a sudden larch of the vessel, when the cable must either un zapily.or,pat,itogether. Strong breaks are attachedto the wheels of the paying out-machinery, which act powerfully, though'very slowly. But,'with the friction we have mentioned on the wheels thexpselves, the breaks are never likely to be resorted to. Of the auxiliary engine for hauling in we needasay nothing except thit we iSncerely hope Its services may'never bo required. Ater ssing offtho wheels th cable runs in a proteted groor-s .along the quiarter deck over a large wheel at the stc o f the vesseL ThiA wheel hasa very deep truaiet- -'aroove ' and all aroumd it is earefulij fi"ed off, and woodwork placed' so that. not'a.n'gi is in the' w*y.

CASBE OF MR. WRIGHT WISON. Lord BROUGHA presenteda petitionfrom Mr. Wright Wilson, a member of the bar, who complained of an in3unctlon obtained aginst him in the Court of Chancery, vhereby he was restrained from proceeding in the Boleiasticajl Court either for .a divorce or the restitution of conjugal rights; that on an appeal to this House against the decree of the Vice-Chancellor, refusing to dismolve the in. junction, the late Lord Chancellor postponed his judgment for 15 months; that when his learned counsel, then Mr. Turner, and now one of the Lords Justices, came to that prt of the case which referred to the validity of the inJunction to restrain proceedinga in Doctors' Commons, he was stopped ba the Lord Chancellor, and was told that he need not tron le himself for upon that point he (the Lord Cbancellor was with him; that the 3unior counsel, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, knowing that his leader had been stopped, naturly forbore to dwell upon that part of the case; that the hearing was brought to a close, the lord Chancelloz took the notes of the arguments away with him into the country, he postponed his judgment for 15 months, and then gave it against Mr. Wilson, upon this very ground, entirely forgetting that he had stopped Mr. Turnerby sayinghewas with bim upon the point. This was Mr. Wilson's complaint, and he (Lord Brougham) must say that it wa the strongest case he had everheard to show the inexpediency of delaying judgments-a position which he had often taken leave to urge upon various judges, and also uon their lordshipa. This unfortunate gentleman, Mr. w Il,on, compladned that he was now without a remed;, because the case wras decided. The LORD CEANCELLOR wan understood to say that a mere llegation of negligence was not a legitimate ground for rehearing the case, there being no principle of law which ought to be more strictly adhered to than the principleInterest rcipublicaw ut itgss ia ltiumn TEHID READINGS.

PRISONERS' REMOVAL BILL The report on the amendments in th is Bill was agreed ENCLOStIRET ACTS' AMND1IENT BILL. The report on the amendment In this Bill was also agreed THE BANRUPTCY LAWS. LordBROlUGAmthen rose, pursaant tonotlce, tocall alotenteon to the subject of ?te bankrptcy lawfs. He said that Si was not his inlention to entr at large, or indeed ak all, upon the general subject of the bsakruptcy laws The subject, however, to which he was about to call attention wasone of the greatest possible imsportance, and he thnerefore hoped that during the appromacing recess hhn noble,and lefmed eriend on the Moolsack would porolbattantion togit, Sith the view of devising remediet for the abuses in the administration of the baskruptcy laws, and for the defect3 in these laws thlemselves. Ibs reuaon for calling attention to this matter was the srocedings that took place at the beginning of the present year, jus't on the eve of the last session, before the great onference of delegates from all the manufacturing townsd wbut particualy from the great towdns of Mnchester, L iverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Bristol, Hrull Hie might add that edinburgh and Glasgow, jnd, he beleved, Belfast and DublU, were represented at that con ference, which was assembled under the auspices of the Lsa Amendmnent Socety, over whtch he predsded so unworthilr. HIe ws cledpon toattend the meetings of that conference, and he must do the gentlemen who attended it the justice to say that during the four dass and the four evenings durikg wrhich the conference lasted he epuld not dicver any the least ground of objecton to any one part of their proceedings. The great number of delegates who were present,th great arsiets of opionsi on the subject which 13oy ha. smet tohdiscuss, ana them tgreatervariety of opinions that existed among their constituencies, had no effect whatever in producing any discord or anything like Cragling or contention, or anything other than a calm, deliberate, and bulsine8sslke consideration of the highiy important subject that had brought them tegether-which wras neither more nor less than the grievances which they had to complain of with zespect to the state of our mercantile law in general, and of no one branch of it more than that' relating to baruptcy nd insolvency. Upon that branch of the Law ahighly impo'tant discussion took lace, and most valuable information was communicated mvnaious parts of the country. With zespect to the reality of the grievances connected with the administration of the bankruptcy laws those delegates ought to be regardedi as judges without appeal. Their testimony was entitled to all possible respect, because it was for them and the communities represented by them that the mercantile law was maade. The measuresa of relief which they proposed might be well or ill-advised, but no one could gainsay their evidence as to the operation of the existoig mercantile law. He believed that some of the measures groredbythem were not at all adapted to give that relief whihe they sought. He would shortly state the grounds of their complaints, and how far he was diaposed to concur In the measures which they suggested by way of remedy. There was nothing on which the conference was more unanimous than that the excenses attendant upon bankraptcy proceedings were grievously heavy. Taking an average of the bankruDtoy proceedings during the lastjhreeears of which retur.ushad een made,-namelg, 185345 (and he would omit the names of the towns in whieh they haa taken place, becaue the delegates averred that the expenses were not so much owing to the law as to the ofcers by whom it was administered) he found thati under 31 bankruptcles a sum of 90,0001. was collected, while the amount distributed amon the creditors was only 44,0001, the remaining sum of ,0001. having been consumed by the bankruptcy proceedings No person was more strongly opposed than hiuself to the payment of offlcers of a court of justice and judicial expenses by fees upon suitors. Bat he made a very great dig- inctionbetweenlitigation and administration, and while he would-not listen to any argument for making the suitors pay for the salaries of the Lord ChanceDor, the Vlce-Chancellor, the lMster of the Rolls, and the -whole judicial staff to far as they were employed in deciding cause; it was a very different thing when persons were employed in the adminstration of causes. In the one case all fees would he contrary to prlnciple; in the other they might beaowed to be p:id to a certain extent by those who ene the labours of the Court. Helthought that the coenmissloners and the higher officers of the courtoughttobepaidby salary as in court of justlce, but that the pymentof the administrative offioers ought to be thrown to a certain extent upon the creditors. Their lordthips would be surprised to hear that the sum of 25,000. a-year continued still to be paid sa comDensation to those Comnmisdloncrs of Bankruptcywho by his Bill of 1831 weredispensed with, and who bad not been otherwise provided forfby legal pronuot,ion, a,nd that the whole of this sum came out of the pockets of the creditors in the Bankruptcy Court. It was utterly unendurable tha aftera lIpse of a quater of a century this oompensation should continue to be defrayed by creditors in the present suits before the courts. The extent of the Bill which he had prepared didnotiobeyond thetransfer totbe ConsoldatedFund of the compensation dpayable to the commissoners whose services were diwpense with in 18SL He doubted whether the services of the messenger could be dispensed with; and, although he had framed his Bill so as to dispense with the accountantand broker,he thoughttbemesseagor should still bekept, subjectto the authority of the commissonersineach case wether it were fit that the messenger should be employed or not. He hd no doubt that the official asignee aD the greatest ground of complaint, and he found that there wa among the judges no difference of opinion as to the present mode of paying that most useful and necessary offlcer. There was the greatest viriety in the emoluments of officdal asignees. In certain CaseM his profits, which were paid by commission, barely sufficed to pay the expenEes of his office, and howas literally left without emolument. In other cases hiaprofits amounted to several hundreds, and even to thoutands of pounds. In two Instances the olricial assignees were in receiptof 3,0001. a-year, and In other cassa they obtained upwuds of 2,0001, a-year, whienotherinstancesthey had nothing. He proposed that the official assignees should be paid in a cerzain proportion by slaries and the rest in fees, whichlattermode ofpaymentwouldwhettheir sealand maintaintheiractivity. 'fliere ought, however, to be a maximum of income from both souroes. Another complaint. which was notaltogether -without foundation, referred to the irregular attendance of the commissioners. He strongly recommended the Lord Chancellor to look Into this subject, and after having ob. taied a zeturn of their attendance durlng the last ,2 months he ue d that his horn and leaned friend would ins upon a more fiequet andegu a attendance upon the par of the commisiaoners. Another objection which was urged to the present system was hat the oommlssoners in manylnstances lived at too great a distance from their respectlve courts; that In theii anxiety not to miss a particula trai In iorder that they =nsght reach their residences in good time the busIness berore them wa often postponed until the noxt day, and that great inconvenienoe to the suitor was the resut. -e might also state that he foundfrom returns whieh h. bean laid upon the table of the House that In one town 130 sit. tngs i bankruptey had been heldin the coureof a sigle year; whlle in another there had been 185, in a thiud 51, and in a fourth 705; but, lamuch ra there were only -365 days in a year, he had been at a los3 to account for the last-mentioned anmber until be lad found that what was termed a " zitine embraced the consideratlon of only one of the different matters which might have been brought before the commissioner for decision. The fact ws he learned that those 705 sittings had been held in 54 days, so that not less than 13 cases had, upon an average, been determined each day. The consequence had been the accumulation of the busness to be done in a gven time to an extent of which the suitors complained. He should next advert to the suggestions which had been made by the committee to whom the Bill which he was about to present to their lordehips had been referred. They had expressed themselves as benlg in favour of permitting the estate of a deceased person who, if he had been alive, would come under the operation of the bankruptcy Law, to be edministered under that law, and had complaiied that under the present system a right of appeal was *ven from the commissioner before whom a case had Cen heard, and who, having seen both the bankrupt andthewitnesses,was likely to be the best judge as to whether a certficate ought or ought not to be granted, to the Lords Justices of Appeal, who would be in possession of no such advantages. The committee had therefore suggested that an intermediate court of appeal should be constitated which should consist of the commissionet before whom the case hac been tried and two of his fellow commissioners. Hoe might add that another great objection which had been urged against the law as it stood was that it made no distinction between traders and non-traders-an objection In the justice of which, however {the noble and learned lord was understood to say), he could not altogether concur. A very general feeling aginst a resort to imprisonment in the case of a bankrupt had also found expression ih the committee, and he himself was of opmion tat, exoept in cases of absolute necessity,it was not desirable that such punishment should be inzficted. He had, he believed, submitted to their lordships? notice some of the chief defects which existed inthe present law, and In the hope that the Bill which he was about to lay before them would in some degree obviato those defects he should conclude by moving that it be read a first time. (Hear, hear.) The LORD CHANCELL0R said it would appearfrom the satement which had just been made by his noble and arned friend that the attempts to amend the bankupt laws from 1831ap to the present moment had been productive of no very beneficial result. Before 1831 the ad'ministration of the estae of a bankrupt had in reality been a matter of private Arrangement, inasmuch as in the country districts the parties concerned had the power to name their own commissioners. The result of that system, however, had been found to be extremely unsatisfactory, and his noble and learned friend had in consequence interposed and created a new machinery, which he (the Lord Chancellor) could not help thinking experience had shown to be far too comprehensive for the duties which It was meant to dischge, and which had consisted of acertalnnumberof commlssioners anda Courtol Review. The Court of Review had very soon been dispenssad with, and its functions were now discharged by the Lords Justices of AppeaL In 1842 another change in the law had been made, and commissioners for the principal town3 throughout the country had been appointed to a greater extent than he deemed to be necessary. The consequenc9 had been that he had two or three years ago obtained the assent of the Legislature to a measure providing that in case any of the country commissioners should from ny cause cease to hold office it should not be ncumbent upon tho Crown to supply their places until their numbers should be reduced to that polnt which might be considered adequate to the proper isharge of the duties which they had to perform. The bankruptcy law had indeed had several additions made to it since 1842-as, for instance, by the passing of the Bill commonly called. Lord Dalhousie's Act, the Winding-up' Act, and the Bankruptcy Consolidation Act; buts notwithstanding al those enactments, the law, accordsng to the statement of his noble and learned frend, still continued to remain in a most unsatisfactory position. One of the main objections which was urged against it was the amount of expense which it entailed, and le was not prepared to contend that some mode of obviating to a slght extent that objection might not upon investigation be discovered. He had, for insance, scertained during the present session, fromretun for which hehad moved, but which hd not as yet been prlnted, that those officers of the Court of Bankruptcy who were knownas "messenger4," and in whom considerable trst was reposed with referenace to the estate of a bankrupt, received in the shape of emnoluments a sum amounting to 1,6001. or 1,700Z. per annum, or nearly one and a-half the annual salary of a County Court judge. Now, it was in his power to effect a diminution of the emoluments of those messengers, and he was In communication with the Lords Justices upon the subject, but. he could not at the same time hold out the hope that any reduction which might in that respect be made would tend materially to dimnlh the expenses consequent upoxu a proceeding in the Bankruptcy Courts, or in any very appreolaible degree lessen the difference between the mm realized and that which was dis. tributed. His noble and learned friend, had also adverted to the mode in which their duties were discharged by the bankruptcy commissioners In the country towns, but upon that point he should observe that his attentionhad been called only in one instance. to any negligence upoa their part, and that in that case he had taken steps to remnedy the inconvenience w^hich had' been occasioned. He miht add that he had never heard any inmplaints made of te mode in wbich the business of their courts was tranted by the commissoner In London, but he musb also observe that the whole metropolits establishment- was, in his. oplnion much larger than was necessay. Vith regard to the question of the rasidence of the comnissioners, there was no doubt that they ought to rewide at such a distance from the scene of their judlel1duties as to enable them at a short notice to be present and perform their duties; but even if be h the power it would no, be in cordance with ordinary usage to compel the commissioners in such towns as uachester, Liverpool, Leeds- and Birmingham, to reside within those towna. The whole subject was one which had been under the consideration of the Government, and he would give his most careful Attention to the Bill of.his noble andlearnedfriend. Hl could not be expected at present to do more than to give that aenrance, but he trasted that it would not be Impossible to devise some scheme to make the proe^edings In bankruptcy less dilatory and expensive than they at present were. The object of the Court of Bankrptcy was to realiza the asset, and to distribute them in the shortest, and siniplest, and fairest manner and no doubt that object could be ttained better than i was at present. His noble and learned friend had made some observations on the subject of appeal, in which he could not concur. He, I as one of thelors justiees, hadhadan opportunity of witnesingthe effect of theappeal which at present existed, and hel should be Eorry to see it abolished. He must also inform his noble friend that he was mistaken in supposing that the lords justices had no pover to examine witnesses, because not only had they such a power but they frequently egercised it, and he certainly should be sorry to see the establishment of a system by which the refusal of a certificate, a calamity so serious to a commercial man, was made to depend absolutelyupon the judgment of one commissioner, withoutiany appealtoasuperior tribunal. le would not further deein their lordships, but wvould onlyre,peat that he would'glve his best attention to the Bill of his noble and learns' friend and end~eavour to cull from it all that might tend to improve the uansatisfactory state of the bDankrupt law. lord BllOUGHM, in a fewr words of explanation, pointed out the great dvatages which had resulted from the Act of 183L So unsatisfacto was the state of jth law at that time that the only woneer was that som change had not been made in it before thatperiod, and lord Eldon, than whom no man had been slower to encourage rash alterations in the law, had agreed that some'alteaon wrs not only nzecessary bnt In fact impossibl to be vim What were the immedite efiosothfechange thean nade Why, property to the extent of nearly 3,000,001 ws dis tributed within a fewmonths which ought to have been ds tributed years before. It had been admitted by one honk that it reizeld 5;000. or 6,0001. a-year from tbemoney left inlIthbyassignees in bankruptcy, whereasafterthe Act of 1831 such a thing became an impossibl. Tt howrever, although a great improvement tyo Tathol Act, upon theudstem,wasitselfcapableofamenauent, and itwas jith the view of amending it that he asked their lordships toaIve a firstreading to the Bill which he had the honour oflying en their lorbipe' table. The Bill was read a first time. Several Bills were brought up from the House of Commons and read a first tlme. The House adjourned ahortly after half-past 6 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, THURSDAY, JTLY 23. The SPEAxm took the chair at 12 o'look. SurERAwruATION ACT AE31 ENT lrLL. Lord NAAS moved the second reading of this Bill. hIr. WILSOI assured the House that he never rose with greater reluctance to perform a publio duty than on the pre. sent occasion. Circumstanced as he had been for nearly fiVr peas, In close connexion with a body of men whos6 merIts were aknowledged by all, and whose performance of the varlous duties appropriated to them In the public servioe had been sich as to secmre to them not only the respect, but the aAjmfrio,a of every one associated with them, he felt tht the i4 iImposed on him of opposing the noble lord's Bill, which at first sight had the appearance of making an enactment highly beneficial to those employed in the civii service, was a painful one. Nevertheless, ho should be shrinking from the duty be owed that House if, considering the offlcial position he held, he were not to take every pains to state the whole facts, which he considered necessary to be known for the perfect understanding of the question, The impressions under which this question had arisen to one of great publio importance and h4d come to be considered what might be termed a great publio grievance were, in the first place, to be triced to a belief that the contributions which the civil servants of the Crown bad made towards the pensions towhich they wereentitled by Act of Parliament were considerably larger than neces- iary to provide for those pensions,anthtidrclte Btlt. ea dy mae and woud in future mke, a sonsiderable profit from those contributions. Nowr, whatever might have been the nature ef the ocontract between the civil servants of the Crown mnd the public,. he admitted that if that caso could be established it would be policy to relinquish the cbarge,at least so far as to reduce it to smlficiency:ry to provide ror the pensions. The next ground on which the imlpre:. slons he hid alluded to had obtained currenoy was the eotion that there had been a breach of engagement on the part of the Crown with the civil servants, inasmuch as a Part of their contributions were. to be created into a fund. which by compound interesb wotal bo a fand entirely at their disposal for one purpose or another. No charge cotld be made more grave than that of a brecah of engagement, actua or impled, entered into between 16,000 men engaged in the public service and the executive Government. How. ever, he thought that that questionihad been disposed of, be, causethe commissioners, whose report was on the table of the House, agreeing with the committee of the House of Commons last year, clearly and definitely dedded that there was no such breach of engagement. He would aqote one 'ingle pasage from the report of the commissioners, .n the faith of whose report the present Bill was sated to be brought forward. The commissioners declared that, whethe; the deductions charged were more or less than equivalent for the auperannuations awrded, no civil servant could ivsy complain of a. breach of engagement on that account, the arms of the engagement with respect to the super. annuations and deductions being well know a the time of the engagement. Consequently, whatever Impreesions might once have existed on the point, there could be no doubt now, fer the matter had beet con. Eidered by the committee of the House of Commons ad by the commissloners, that no such breach of engagetaent as had once been alleged did in reality exist Then, asM. ing that point to be disposed of, the whole question resolved into one of policy; and it was justly stated in the rep6rt of the commissioners that, after all, this was a question if the remuneration of public servants. He thought the coimm. tioners *.-ok a wise ana just view of the case, when they stated that the claim of pension could not be separated from fhe amount of salary. Vith regard to the question of sufficlency of salary, it would be his duty to show that within the last four or five years there had been revisions and a large increase of salaries in Almost every department of the publio service. In 1852, in the three departments of InLana Revenue, Customs, and Pcet-offce, the totai amount of salies was 2,167,0001i, and in the last yar 2,406,0001., showing an increase at thd pub. ]lo cost of 239,000Q. ayear. He did not xsay that Xi in. crease was an inoreae entirely of salaries, buihe was quite certaln that a oonsiderable proportion of it was occasdoned by an increase of salies to individua oflicers. The appendix to the report of the commisoners contained a comparlson of the remuneration received by pubUc servants of the Crown and by persons employed in large public establishments unconnected with the Crown. It appeared that in the Bank of England lerks of 18 yeas of age re ceived 601h a-ear, of 19 years 701. a-var, of 20 ears 801. a-year, and of 21 years 1001. Ater theage of 21 thesilarles went on increasing 5. a-year until the age of 29, when the clerks received 1401. a-year, and the salaries then Increased progressively up to the age of 43 years, when the maximum salar7 of 2501. a-year was reached. Now, clerks in the publio service, in aepartments where the duties were at all analogous to those performed by clerks of the Bank of Englnd, received a much higher scale of salaries. The lowest salaries given in the publio offlices in Westminster were 90. a-year, and some commencedat 100?., aud it would be found upon the whole that the pabHlo servants were infiitely better paid than the clerks in the Bank of England. If, however, any portion of the public servants considereil that they were insufficiently remunerated they had only to submint their case to the heads of their departments, who-as had been repeatedly done during the last four or five yeas-would bring the subject under the notioe of the Treaury; but although the insfficient remuneratlonof publio servants mightbe*a just groundforrevising the scale of salaries, it could be no reason for an indlscrimlnate increase of salaries, without iegard to merit or efficency. The proposition of the noble lord would amounttoanindisnam te increaof salaries throughoutthe public service to the extent of 51. a-year Upon salaries exeeoding 100Z., and 21. I0s on salries below tat amount. Now, supposing some portions of the public service were at present underpaid, an increaso of 2j, or of 5 per cent. upon the existing saaries might be quite injfficient to raise those salaries to a proper amount; and would it be any satisfaction to persons in such a position to receive this increase when the] same increase was given to a large body of public servants who co-ld not complain of boing underPad ? Some years ago a proposal was msde to reduce the salaries in All publig departaents at the unifoim oate of 10 per cent., and that proposal was opposed on t4e ground that if any portion of the public servants were overpaid it would be proper to reduce their salares, but that the indisrminate reduction propsed was neier Just nor reasonable. The noble lord rIaasi Iadecom aIned that a great number of those public svants w%lose Laes were subjected to abatements never derived any advantage from the fund (hear), but payments of thiskindnuast be regarded in the aggegate, and not as affecting individaal cases. Tho were in the nature of an insurance, wbiclx must be judged of by the charge upon the whole and not upon the indiviuaL It bad been argued and no doubt iustlv, that great hardshiparosewhena pubic srvanb died. beore be was superannuated, because hisfamilylost fle benefit of the abatements made from his salary. The 1Tea=ry had proposed that In such cames widows shopld be entitled to certain gratuities, and he believed such an vrangement would be attended -with great advantages, and 'wonul afford cony siderable relief to the offiexrs in tho various public departments, who were now called upon for pri'ate contributions to relleve cases of this nature. It had been complained that the abatements from saaries had not been constituted into a fund. He did not know what difference that could have made to public officers, because by the Act of Parliament no individual officer could receive nnoxe than he now received The Act prescribed both the rate of deduction from Esaries and the rate of the superannuation allowancesVand he could not understand how these officers could have been in a better rositlon if their abatements had constituted a separate funa than they now occupied with the security of the Government for the payment of their allowances. It was said that if the abatements had constituted a fund 1 which had borne compound interest the fund would now have been much larger than was necessary for the purposes for which It was formed, and that the civil servants would have possessed a clim to some division or appropiatlon of that amountt in their favour. If it could be proved that thepublic servants did not enjoy the full proceeds of their contributions such a measure might be jusntfiable, but there were few things more deceptive than funds of this lond, which from present payments had to meet future contingent charges. As an instance, he might mention the case of the London police fund, which was commenced In 1839, under the authority of an Act of Parliament, by contributions from the polce to provide superannuation allowances for members of that force. In 844 the fund had risen to 50,0001., while the chlrges upon it were only 6001 a-year. In 1852 the fund had risen to 104,0001., and a reduction of the contributions made by the men was strongly urged, but upon investigation such a course was not deemed advisable. What bad been the result? The fund which in 1852 amounted to 104,0001. was at this moment reduced to 4,0001., aud was so far from being ufficient to meet the demands upon it that aid had been solicited from the Government, in addition to the assistance which was obtained from the metropolitan rates He thought this case would satisfy the House that very mistaken lceas might exist with regard to the accumulation of abatements under circumstnces of thisdescrlptiou. He hal a return, howing the amount charged from year to year on the publio funds for compensations and suprannuation allowances. It appeared that in 1834, wlhen the Act vws passed, the whole amount of pensions payable in respect of the public service was 358,0001., and the whole anount of allowances, including compensations for abolished offices, was 693,001. Year by year dnce that time the amount under the head of compensations had rapidly diminished, until in 1856 it was reduced to 210,0001. ;-but-year by year the amount -Of sEperannuAyoA 1VunVeS LGA incirC O0 ipnS1y. The sum ehargeable in 1M for pensiOns alone was 358,0001., but thad now increased to 630,0001. The total of Compen sationis and allowances, taken together, had increased from 693,0001. In 1834 to 830,0001. in the present year. 3Xoreover, this ws& an annually increasing sum, for last year the whole charge was 799 0001, and the sum required for the present year was 0,000l. And there was this remarkable fact-th-at whereas the whole amount of abatements taken at present from the whole publlo service wan 74>0001., the increase witbin the last four years in pensions alone was equal to the whole of that amount. In 1851 the amount of pensions payable to the ecivil servants, as distinguished from compensations, [ was 609,0001,,wiels eri a increased to 589.0001. who entered the service before 1829 did not contribute to this fund alhough they received pensions to a larger atmounttia those *ho did. Let thea House see how the case would stand between the civil servants and the Crown en the showing of the civil servants thenmslves. The amount of pensions and compensations voted for the present year was 827,0001., and the civil servants themselves, on their own Bhowing, said that wlitn the whole public service should consist of officers; who hiad entered the service since 1829, the amountof abatemnents would be 94,0001. &-year, and that, taking the principal of the fund, and charging compound interest upon the abatements fromL year togyar, they would have an accumulated fundin 1891 o 5,000,0001 They reckoned, thdrefore, that the amaount of abatements at thar time would be 94,0001. a-year, and adding' to' that sum 1500OOO. as interest at 3 per cent., en the accumulated fund of 5,000,0001.,'they would lhave a fand of 244,0001. a-year. That was taking what he did niot admit to be a fair calculation, but he too it on the shiowing of the clviL servants themselves. Now, what would be the charge on that fund at that time? The charge voted for the present year was 827,0001., and if they tooK the presnt chaxrge as being the then probable charg, and deduotedg,4,000?. sas the 9aa_cimum payment in respect of abatements; and -152,0001. as intezest on the fond from 827,000., there would beoa deficiency of 581,0001. to be made good by the public. BELt it was said that the charge of 8,0001. would be greatly reduceed in conse oence of the diminished amount of pensions that wouviad have to be paia. M3s right hon. frend the maember for Portsmouth (Sir F. Baring) gave it as hils opinon before the committee last year, that when the amount of charge should be reduced to the lowest rateit oul beone-hir loer hanthe sum charged at they oud have' il t* deduct 2146,0001. a-yeat-namely, O,OIL, the MaiMUMa payment in respect of abatements, and 152000l. as tho interest on the fund, so that there Would be still A deficiency of 306,000. to be made good by the public. [The hon. gentleman pursued the caldultion furter, ana Showed that even on the xtatemnent of the civil segltsemslvee sna taik into account all contin gencies ihe deridenytobemaoup the Houe would amount tb b7,0001. Thehon.gentleman continued:-He was of opinion ht if tue whole of the contributions of the civilservants were madeintoafund, compound interest added, deductions only made of p"ments for pensions to thow who had retired since 1829, 4nd vO per cent, given by Government, it would be no more than xufficient to defray futuro charges. He loped he ha satisfied the Houwe that whstever course the Government had taken itwas, In their oninion, not attended with any degree of injuLstce to the civil servants. It seemed to have been altogether loet sight of in this discussion that the deductions were made from the actual salariea of the servants. A man entered the service at 19 years of age, at a ulary of 100I a-year, and the deduction was five per cent. He went on untl he had been 40 or 45 years in the publie service, and by gradtml increase his salary was ' O'O?., 1,2001., or 1,00. ("Oh! ohl") He could quote a great number of such cases. ("Oh P) He did not mean a great number In proportion to the whole 16,000 civil servants (hear, hearl but thera were many such cases. During the whole period of serice the deduction was the same per cent., although the salary Was increasin , and upon retise. mnent the ension was calculated upon te full amount of sala. Unatl the noble lord introduced this Bill no proposton had ever ben, made to giveup the aaitement unaompanied by arevision od salary. Iu the commlttee of the Eouse of Commons last year the hon. baronet the mem ber for Evedham propoaed a soeris of resolutions, ane of wn fhich was:- s-wsasfRos: "That, adopting the principle of remuneration stated in the second resoluton, the salary of all appointments here. aefer to be made in the citl service sthl be revisedaclood- cn8 as the amount of such slary shall be judgedS o po too gh or too lot, duly considering theserviceto bet erformed and thse amout of deductions (if any) thich have been fr Stafford Noriteot produced a set of resolutions, and one of his resolutions was asfollows .- "That,t In accordance writh theseprincdples, the ysem of mawing deductions fromksalaries for superannuation should be abandoned; the salarys of civil servauts should, mhere necessary, be revsed so s to make them justly epuivdent to The work demanded, and the newl Act should tistinctly recogntzete right of the Goverdment to call upon thoe who haveo attined a certin age, or whose state of health revento their reo'ar attendance to the duties, to retire onmeservicr with or without a retire olwance as the circusthanoes of the ease may require." There wnas a distinct conneflonheptbedeen the superanna. ffon allowncn and bthe saaryd to be paid. The hon. member for Horsham proposed:o- "That, in caraing out these resolutions, the committee contemplate the propriety of reoconsidering the scales both of pernsons and saaries, as at present arranged." He twas sorry to say that the noble lord's Bill did neither the one nor the other.. When the committee came to conslder their report the following resolution ewas pro posed by the noble lord the member for Lynn: m That, in the evenut of such deductions being done away, theratesof pay ent inpthe pvaro sebranches oE the cyi service ahoul revhed, there being no ground for an indiscriminate augmentation of salaries, wrhich wrould other. w tise resultfrom the change proposed." The resolution was notthought sufficiently distinct as to the obaect intended-that te reduction of te salaries shouldbe governedsbyothenreducifon of abatements-and an amend ent wras proposed to insert te words " with a due regard to the amount of reductions remittes The noble lord the member for Cockermouth professed to have founded his Bill upon the recommendations of the ommissioners appointed lastyear, and imply proposed to give up the abatement. No aoubt the con tners reported than the abatement should be given up, and that there should be no reducUton In the salaries of the present public servants; bnt they obviously felt there were very great objections to the proposal to mke a present of 100,0001. a year as afutre charge to the public servants indiscrminately, without any seclal reasonw whatever. Thne commissioners said . "tWe have poken of he supsed loss of revenue as temporay. It mut be evident,e n the case of any ciel servant nowr liable to deductions, that under any circumstances this loss could not continue for a longefpeniod than the remining time during which he continues in tho seridoe. On hni psrrement an opportnnity will at ail events occur of revising the slatry. But ia probable that In the maonrty of cases a opportunity of revising the salary will occur at a much earioeriyeriod. It *ppears that In each public department the cerks are divided into classes with reference to the Importance of the duties whech thev have to perform. In the same class each clerk proceeds from the ,mtaiusmu,m to the natimum salary by lenth of svce; but in all promotions from an inferior to a higher class t is req,ured that the selection shall be madefo'alo from superior witnese for such higher claes' The principle of promofing from cass to class inconsequeng a of merit alone, without regard to seniority, has beenforced on the headsof deparments by theo highest authorities,and mbay bo considered the estabcthed rule of the civil service.

The comnilssioners pinted ou not onlIy the inequality, but the nomames of th existingh stem, wthich required to be remedied. utwa d the commjalionexs say? They showed that this was only one andi almost an inferior cause of complaint on the part of the pubLic servants.

The noblenlord left the Act in every other respect asritvwas. Nor, thieeffect of that Act wjas that certa persons only were entitledto pensions. The Bill of the noble lord sought to relieve these persons from the payment of abatements, but it did not propose to give pensions to any other cLass of public eervants. The offlcers of the Poo Law Board were not entitled to pensions, and they felt that they had no reason to complain, because they were not reqofedoto ffyai,tsmentsh The ofeficers of the Treas on ineother hand, wiere enttltedtopensions, and therefore they did not consider themselves agieved in being calle upon toppyabatements Under the Bill of te noble lord the offsers of te Treas would continue to be entiled t pensions athoughrelievednfroms the paymeno abatements, o whilethe of icers of the Pcoble Board would not bemo entitled to pensions than they were amthe present moment, (Hear, hear.) Nothing could ben;ore unjust than such a istinction. [fa l opublio servants were tobe put upon the same footing with regard to abatements, on ght tei y a'lo withrespect to pensions. (Hiear, hear.) None of the olicers of the Post office, with the exception of those in ondion, nburgh, and Dublin were entitled to hensions; m*al orderktoshon howmuchthe advantages of the Act of 183s were appreciated, he moght state that only last year th thepo citef1hroughoure the country requested to be ermitted to pb-tiase pensions by paying abatements. How were they to be deatt with after the extinction of abatements? the Bil of the noble lord would not entitle them to pensions. Again, the supplemental clerks, who now formed a lado e body of publc servants, paid no abatements and had bit her nbeen superannuated on a different scaleo from those who did. the Bill of the nosie lord, yt abolhg abatements, wtould do away with the distinction twhich nov existed between the supplemental clerks and the permanent members of the public ser vice. The Education Board, the Poor.Law Board, and a great number of other public offices not included in the Act of 1834, presented anomalies which must bere drsedbtwhcae iloteno b le lr etwoi.n not entiled, to pensions. The roesewouldi pvenpsons did a year to the public service without disciinnatio but. 3n aadition to that. between 390,000?. and 400.000?. would be required for pensiona to those who were not nowr entitled to them. (Hlear, hear., Agais, had they considered what the ehtect of the Bill would be with respcect to the army?7 The payments nOW made to the public service in the shape of superaninm'ion illowances of every lcind amounted to tJhe sumo 0.0? -er hra h iiaypensions did larger amount la Penslons than the whole army. (Hear.) At present the differenoeinthepaymentsto the two services could be defended, because the civil servioe contributed to a superannuation fund, which the army did not; but the momnent the abatements were abolished no such defence could be miade. (Hear, hear.) SomeD hon. gentlemen were disposed to think that tshe abatements were not a security to the publo servants for their pensions. Those who took that view were not acquainted -with the flcctuating temper of the House of CoDmmons. Not long ago a proposal wras made to the House, and supported by a large minority, to reduce the salaries of the whole public servants by 10 per cent. What was the answer to that proposition? It was thiat the Government had made a contract with the civil servants, and th it would be a breach of fadth to reduce their saIare6s.Suaos!ug that the same coid fit were to come over theHouse v,$th respeot to thoepensoinfund,would it nobbe an advantage to the publi servants if itey coul say that Parliament had entered into a contract with them, that in consequence of that contract they had paid abatements, and that they therefore claimed their pensions as a riht, aad not as afavour? Under any circtumstances, indeed, he did not thinkthDeHouse ought to abandon the system of rant. ing superainnution allowances. (Hear, hear.) He'believe not only that the existnene of such a system created a bonid between the Crown and its servants, but that the absenoe of it would be higbly injurious to the public service. It was all very well to talk of dicharging public ser. vans w'hen they were unfit for duty, but, the thing was simply impossible. No chief of a department wouldever expose himself to the odium of discharging a public servant without some provision. Moreover, a superannuation viewed as a means of promoting the efficiency of the service was upon the whole an economlcal,and beneficial Arrange. mnent. He could not help tibnling. indeed, that the demanad for a redutieon of the abatements would never have been mnade had it not been for the pressure of the income. tnthe public servants, to whom that tax assumed a caatrvery different from that which it presented to the rest of the c-ommunity. Ot'herpoople paid the income-tax j In the uual wa~t coellector, but tiL pnublie a ervats paid eititho a pe of a dedueotonfrom theirallarl.

Mr. G. oLVE gavoe the hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Treasury ful credit for goodwill towards the civil serants, and at the same time must compliment him upon the ingenuity he had displayed in combating this measoe. There was, however, only one point that apelied to the caefor he should leave cut of consderation All that the in. gentleman had aiod about the underatanding be twen hemabers and their constituents, and also the' referencethe hAd made to the army, which was entirely unonnected Yith this subject. (Hear.) The main point was this,-the hon. gentleman sid the revenue would sufr because 306,0D01. would have to be Paid for Pensions some yearn hence; but, accordinR to thecivil servantse own satement, the amount wontld be on%l 240,0001.'- There was a fallacy in that statement, The eci ervants complained ofu the injustice that a certain number only of their body, appointed since 1834, pd the deduction, and that they did not receive a quid Pro qb for those payments. Thee hon. gentleman hid stted that al those deductions were swaionwed upin the payment of pensions and an rannuation allowances, but in the estimate were incluced the whole of the pensons and super. annuation allowances, while on the etohr side was taken only the amountpai0d by the civil servants. If the whole of that body pai e S&IU the calculation would be orret, but at present the deductions were paid by a smaul clas while the pensions were open to All.

OL E asked whethe the hon, gentlem an. meaut to ay that in the year 1890, which had bwen referred to, the payments forpensions would amount to a balan of 306,000n against the country ? 'MJr. WILSON said, according to the statement madA by the right hon. baronet, the member for Portsmouthx (StieF. Baring), the charfE for pensvons would be reduoed, when all doueduions came into operation, by one third, or, according to thesttement of the civl servants themselves, by oneshalf. In the former case there would be stil a charge of 244,0001 against the puboi, and even upon the other statement thero woud remAin a great excens to be pald by the country. ur. CLIVE said accordin to thre calculation of Dr. Parr that estimate was unfounded. At present thl civil servants appointed sice 1829 were paying 70,["0a. a-Tear, whie they were receiving only 12,0001. a-year in pensions. They also complainecd that a large clas of pubUe ser vants escadpd entirely and paid nothing in the shape of deductions, but were stil entitled to pensions. A m appointed to an office before 1829 mnaht have had his lary going on increasn til it rewa hed 1hf001. iper annum, and yet receive the fUll amount of superannuation, thoug exempted-from the payments. He would ask whxether it was not practical tre thIt all persons appointed to permanent omices did receive p?enions? (Hear, hear) And if that was the case, how was it possible to make a distinction betwreen those who paid the reductionsand the whox did not? (enarn h ra The whole question before the House *As whether the arrangement originally rsae with the civil servants was to be considlered I the natuio of an assurance, or as a matter of salary. The contract so niuch spoken of wAs regnant with ambiguity. which ambigity hiad never yet been explained. The civil servnts had a good right tosuppose that if they bald 5? towards an allowance they were entitled to fpu value for that anountv but it was proved that thils they did not receive, He thougat the supporters of the Gove£rment had a right to omplain of dthe obstruc tive cours taken by Her Majeety's Mlnaisters on this queston. The Secretary to thaeTreast.r told them the question could not rest where it was, and on a formaer occasion the Chancellor of the Excheq,uer spoke of the matter as one requiring remiedy, and yet no attempt was made to introduce a mea-. sure on the part of the Government. (Hear.) The right hionr gentlema the member for CArlisle at the time the present system was introduced said expressly that the civil servants were to contribute to insurances~, and would receive the whole benefit. He could not say whether he used the wordl1 "fund," but he admitted havinig used the ex presson as to Insmurnce, N-ow, if the arrangcment was in the iiature of an insarance, surely the'civil servants had a rig1kt to the whole benefit (hear), and the qLuestion was whether they, had the whole benefit or not.iHe wishednow toaseortain whethe,y the Government would undertake to give them the fulbenefit, for if so he, for one, would be stismfied. The ho.gentleman need not trouble himself about the state of publio feeling on this question. He believedl that the public feeling In this country was in favour of honour and justice (hear, hear),.and that it leant very much towards generosity. He did not think tbay were amenable to the charge of inconsiderate extravagance brought against them by the hon.' pentleman, or to the charge of indecency either. [Mr,. Wilson had sad "not decent."] Well, not%decent% meant Indecncy.(A lugh.)The overmenttook- credit for its Mrr. WEGUELIN said the Chanocelor of the Exchequer en a former occasion, and the Secretary of the T!reasury niow, had toldl them there were so many specia recounimenda. tionus in the report of the commissioners that It was desirable to delay till all those recommendlations could be il-. eludedl in any measure that was passed, The firs of these specialrecommendations wa a new scae of pensions. NOW, this new scae of pensIons was recommended by the commnittee of last year, and the Government were prepaired to include It in a Bil of their own. The next special recommendation was an alterationx with regard to the vge of retirement, and a provision for compulsory retirement. This measure was In the BiM No. 2 brought forward IV the Governmeut lsat 7ear. Hear, hear.) The third special recommendation of the commissioners regarded gratuiities to be allowed to public servants. This provisionL was also in the Bils Not. laud 2 of last year, as was likewise the next, having reference to compensations, which had the recommiendation of the committee.

So far. therefore, as he ommtte'srecomenations -ere concerned there Waa nLo cause for dea,for the Government had: already shtown that they were preparedl to adopt them. (Hear.) The points in the report of the commissoners that'the, Government had not yet, agreed to were: -l, That the ordi. nary scale of pensions shouldl be extended to dockyard officers instead of the scae of 40ths they now enjoyed, and he contended that, niotwithstanding what had fallen from the Secretary to the Treasury, the amount affect-ed by this reconmnwendatlon would be exceedingly triflng. Then there were recommendations respecting the Post-office, and these were of&a very modest character indeed. The servants of theo Poat-office in, London, Edinburgh, and DuLblint were. placed on a footing different from others, and the recoinmnendatiUon of the commissioners was, that the systam M pensions should be revised with the view of placing it on a more uniform prbincile-the zemuneration for services to consist partly of salarier. and partly of sprnut6ai~ 'anes.

ZONDOR, ,RrDA. JULY 24, 1W8. - In the House of Lords last naight, - The Marquis of BBEAD.Ar-nAN read Hn k&JEsTY'S gracious replies to the addresses presented by tho House on the subjects of the Afeican slave trade and the national survey. LordBROowU Am, in an elaborate speech, caUed t0e attention of the House to the defective working of the bankruptcy laws, and laid on the table a Bill to remedy those defects. The LonD CRAJ'cErzon replied in fitting tcrmns and promised to give the Bill every attention. The Bill wasthen read a first time. Several other BiUs were forwarded a stgej aftetr which their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons; at the early sitting; on the order for the second reading of the Super- annuation Act Amendmlent Bill,j.noved )y Lhor. MIr. Wmsoi, in opposition to the m=otion, ob* kerved that there existed a misappreheiision renazW lug thbis question, which was traceable to ai erroneous belief that the contributions whieli had been made by the civil servants of the (toWN towards the pensions to which they were entitled by Act of Parliament were considerably larger than was necessary to provide for this fund, and that the State had indireitly made, and woual in future make, a pr6fit therefrom. He admitted that if that case could be eitablished it would be policy, whatever might be the-nJature of- the contract, to relinquibh or at'least to ieduce,-the charge. There was another groiinud for *the lmisapprehension,namely, a.aotion that there had been a breach ofagreement o3kthe pazt of the COaWx with the civil servants; but-the commissioners, whose report waag before the Hoiuse, agreeing with' t'e committee of that House of last year, had clearly decided that there had been io such, breach. of engagement,.; The whole question, 'therefore, resolved itselC into one of Policy,-M to the remuneration of public servants; and their claim couId not be separated from the question asto the amount of sala ries, which had been iicreased of late years, and s revison of which had.been recommended by the commissloners. lIr. WILSOX then entered upon a long and elaborate sories of calculation', in order to show the fallaci6oiiiUd deceptivenatare of conclusions formed from the amount of a fund liable to contingent claims, and that upon the most favourable data, furnished by the civil servants themselves, so far from the contributions being in excess of the pensions, in whatewr shaps the matterwas viewed, they would leave alarge deficiency tobe' made good by the House. Tbe Bill of Lord I.AS, which did not adopt all the recommendations df the commissioners, he contended, would introduce more auid greater anomalies than it proposed to remove. His own personal feeling and inclination were, he said, in favour of any benefit to be 'conferred upon' the civil sei,vants, batit -was the dutyof the Government to watch over the disposal of the public revenue. If the House should decide that the public servants were inadequatelv paid, he hoped, when it forced the Government into a corner, it would be equally ready to impose new taxes to make up the deficienqy. -In his opinaon, neither in ju!tice, reason, nor public policy, was there any ground for this bill, and he moved to defer thid second readinfi for three months. .- .'... Mlr. G. CLIn said the civil servints complained of an inequality which placed-those who had been Mpponted since 8l29 upon a worse footing tha those previously appointed; and they considered that if 1;hese confributions were, as they mainltained, of the nature of an insurance, they wer~e entitled:to 'ts fulU benefit. Mr. WEcuerli indicated the coursetaken 1y-thes commissioners, and replied to certain statements of hr. WnzSox. The House, he observed, was called upon not only to deal out strict-justice, but equal justice toall pirties; and 'the civil-servants. oomplained, not of injustice under the Act of Parliament, but of the Act itielf, and desired to have it altered .. . . ^ t-' '- ,$ir'F.

It has long been set down among the singularities of our race that an Englishman is more -than half satisfied when he knows the causes of a disaster. No doubt he is a very reasonable being, and often fnds in a sufficient theory a compensation for actual failure. If it be' so, 'our readers will fmnd an iimenese store of comfort in the asape of Sir Cmu.AiTs XAPIER's published opinions on the condition of the Indian Army, and snmo extacts'from the more recent -official despatches of 'the GovmxoA-GEmxRsi. Any one who reads the' formeir, unless he resides -under the sbade of some Director or retired Com:an,nuerinChief Wi only wonder how w haveZeldtlie empire so long by such a- rope of sand -as our mflitar system turns out to -be... That, . no doubt, has been the very reflecticnu that .-ias a thousand times instilled a false security, and -triled the thonght of reform. It has gone on in -this way for generations; it answers; no other 'way would answer, for what we can tell. True, there are misgivings, not to say actual dangers. -So there were thirty years ago; ay, sixty years. Indeed, there never was a time when there were -not people to tell us our empire hung on a -thread. Bishop ErEBm says that had Lord Co- nBR&urmmR been forced to raise the siege of Bhurt,-pore, as LAkB had done twenty years before, every mnan from the Sutlej to the Nerbudda who had a -sword, or who could either buy or steal a horse, would have risen against us. It so happens that, chiefly owing to the intense Jealousy of the Indian Government, and the incubus 'which sits on the pen and the tongue of every Indian functionary, we have not had many means -of knowing how' the Bystem worked. We have had ao men of quick observation, sound judgment, -iree from professional bias, and'able to defy all authorities who pased through India, -ook notes of all they saw, and gave ,us the results of the tour. When a man did this, -or 'hen opinions did actually transpire, these 'were'set down to disappointment, eccentricity, or -nalice; and few indeed are the men who are not .open to such imputations. In fact, the prophet .always was an eccentric, passionate, and rather ill-tempered being. For years it has been known -that Sir CHARxs NAP= felt the most grievous -dissatisfactioin with the state of things in India; -and that he. had incurred the wrath of its rulers by -4the freedom of his tongue. But what did this matter? His- authority was as dust in the scale ecomlared with the vast reality of an empire which had survived so many hostile predictions, and which it was often Baid required rather a -certain assimilation to the Oriental character than - so, striking a contrast as the energetic Englishluan is apt to become. India is a -subject, indeed, on which mere Englishmen-and -everj one of us who has not seen India is a mere Englishman in the eyes of the more fortunate -have hardly courage to speak. The whole thing i is a mystery in our eyes. None of IIs can divine by -what spell or by what law of nature the achoolfellows whom, we b1eat at every possible trial become in a few years collectors or judges with princely incomee, or military officers 'with extraordinary employments of great responsibility. it was not for us to criticize a state of things in 'which the -least drop of English. blood went for so much, where it seemed a positive waste to be clever *nd strong, and where the only danger was lest, ike G- VLrv among the Iilliputians, we should 'occasionally do damage by forgetting the smallneas i and the frailness of the race we had to deal with. Henevi it is that even the British public, ever slive as it is to all misgovernment at home, and quick to -hear complaints, was not roused by the known indignation audn misgivings of Sir 'CIAXRE5 NArpiBx In fact, what could we do ? We have oily just renewed and largely modiiied the Charter, with hopes of improvement. As for the Army, that wYould not, reach. ..These standing arnies -do intieed stand. The highest military reason is that a thing is so. Why, for examDle, didwe make Delhi a strong fortress, surround it with new bastions,-excavate a deep ditch out of the granil rock, !eave within it' a hu&LdrA thousand muske6, two park 'of -the-heaviest -artillery in -ndi6'npb wdez 'enoug ti 'blazKf a*j' at aiLy enemy'fr, f ear andtth-nplace thevwhIe jn tha sole charge - three na iveegiuients t Why did we not iethe6 absuiity of thi course ? -qTh'aWswer is, that it always -was so in Indian memory. It has been so the 'whole of this centuvy, and no harm has come of it. What is described in these passages from the Life of Sir Charles Naapier is the gradual Indiab Army; and the iimuStaneous elevation of the Hindoo. Had'there been. a compact by virtue of which we were gradually to surrenderour dominirn, to relinquish step by step the ground won for us by a succession of conquerors above our own standard, to let 'the Hindoo' acquire the strength, the ranjk, the self-confidence, the abso'lute independence, and the contempt of ourselves necessary to qualify him for doing without us, we could. not have done otherwiee than we have. Here we see. the picture of' a. immnense army, of the finest men the. country c6uld pro-: duce; full of caste and prejudice; well paid; with wives, children, ana camp followers; completely officered by their own race; these. officers men of years, experience, and dignified character; and everything, in a word, that could make a good native army. We tee a longindulgence to native pride and scruples to an extent unknown in our own army at home. On the other hand, we see the British officers of these noble regiments generally reduced to a few youths, -learning their profession from the very men they are. sent to command and overawe; spending their time in amusements, or, worse, in idleness; or, if they do learn and practise their profession, forthwith transferred to some civil employment. The collection of the' revenue, which is said to have drained the Judicial Department of its best heads, robbed the Army also of it$ ablest hands. Thu irn many regiments England has become only a name, as much a name as the puppet we left on the throne of the MioGur and his feudatories. What remained intact, what improved, and grew stronger day by day, was the native orgaaiization. There were, indeed, pageants of Mahomedan Royalty, and there were also other men in buckram that stood for the British conqueror. History recorded itself. in a few foreign uniforms and idle ceremonies. There was nothing real but the native, and that reality was witnessed with respectful alarm by such men as Sir CHA.LuEs NAp'n:, with blind indifference by such men as Sir WnLr,rm Gomrm, and, we must add with pain, Lord Dan`OISIE. SO Sir CHAnES protested and prophesied. He knew the breath would be hardly out of his body before the whole rotten fabric woUld crumble to pieces, but he would not be the CASSiWDRA of India, the laughingstock of Directors and Departments. He would, indeed, have protested in vain. He did protest in vain. His own life and character were a continual protest against the indolence and luxury of the linglishman who plays the soldier to the increasing contempt of the iHindoo. Sir CaHAr,s was laughed at, snubbed, caricatured, and finally beaten from the field, warning his friends to the last of the impending catastrophe. He has, however, done his work. We have his light, and we shall profit by it.: We have now to reconquer India, and we shall do it. We have to reconstruct our system, to reorganize our army, and to create a new ideal of the British soldier in India. That we shall do, for we are not a nation to give up our ground once won, or to acquiesce in deterioration. We have lost ground, slipped, and fallen; but we have no doubt India will soon be ours in a sense in which it has never been before.
Certainly, if ever the British Empire sinks into decay.and the New Zealander sketches the ruins of St. Paul's, it will not be for want of keeping. pace with what is called the spirit of the age. Some nations- accuse us of slowness, of, too great tenacity of '1sage, and of a nervous hatred of change; but it ' may be. aed what o. reformers, what-'heor' . phila ropists,:3ia h otV been welcomed among us,. ancl to some e"tent influenced the action of Government? The doctrine common to the oldest 0rthodoxy and to the newest free thought, that all the nations. of the earth are of one flesh, has been accepted and pushed to its etreme consequences ceby the liberal Ap e trations which have ruled this country during the last 30 years. Not only have we ruinedl the West Indies for the Negro, and alienatedt the Cape colonists for the Caffre, but we have bestowed the highest rights and imposed the m6st difficult duties on populations which no other rulers in the world would think of governing except by a wellorganized police. Conspicuousfori all the qualities which unfit men for the working of free institutions are the inhabitants' of our Mediterranean possessions,-Gibraltar, Malta,- and the Ionian Islands. These races have ' passed lmder the dominion of England along with. the harbouts and fortresses which so many nations have coveted, but which the valour and sacrifices of this country' have succeeded in securing. How would France or any other continental State have governed'them ? A G.eneral at the head of the-Administration with almost absolute power would have been suipported by a set of offlicials appointed by the Government at home, and, as a general. rule, composed of men born in the mother country. The natives would have been left to lie in the sun and' eat oranges, or to wander forth to get their living in - the Levant or on the coast of Africa, but allinterference in the concerns of the military colony would have been strictly forbidden. and their liberty of quarrelling, and fighting, and thieving among themselves woula have been closely curtailed. - But England must confer on everybody the blessings of freedom. Not a promontory or island which has been the Cave of AduUam to the reprobates of half Europe but must learn the blessings of Magna Charta and the Bill of Xights. The results of this system -we have seen in a late. case of murder tried by a Maltese jury, but the most striking instance. of its absurdity is afforded by the meetings .of the thing called the lonian Parliament. The lonianT Islands have. been virtually in the possession of England for half a century. They are supposed to constitute a Republic under British protection, but their affairs are, in reality, administered.: directly by the '.Lord .'.High 'Commissioner. - The islands are of the highest value as naval positions,- and Oorfn commands completely the Adriatic and the ILevant. The Ionians have even less than the small share of good qualities which falls to the lot of the Mediterraiean populations. We need not enlIge on a fact pretty well known, that our Consulates in every region Where theCephaloniotea and Corfuotes wander are sufficiently employed with their evil doings, ia which they only find rivals in their fellow-subjects, the Maltese. Yet everywhere they receive protection, as much as they demand and more than they deserve.. Since the Peace. of 1815 they have' been well and kindly governed; the taxes are little or nothing, the presence of the garrisons brings money into the islands, and the prosperity of the people is greater than that of any neighbouring community. The Io0nianshliad the blessing of good government at a time when the mainland was drenched with blood, and when Greece was still a-Turkiih province. It was impossible for the most ingenious hater of this country'to point to any real grievance, . while the benefits conferredby the British ,ocupation were constant and undeniable. The iystem of administration:'might, then, sha;veen viseiy-bontinubd, and the mnutterings of restlessnesi and- discontent disregarded' by - a nation which-gve'rnsg uccessfully men of ' all races in' every qiirtet o£ the globe. But the mania for constitutions was too strong for the good sense of the Government. Under Lord S5ATor's Commissionership Parliamientary Government was granted to the islands, and all the national character shoWed itself at onoe. Of course, the Conistitution is an absurdity. The islands are_ our military posts, and irust be governed accordingly; and the Parliament can never be anything but R Imeans for a few unquiet and *malicious spirits to ihow their hatred of this country and their qymjathy with its enenie8. Frequently the language usod by the wretched upstarts who call themselves repreo sentatives of the people has been so seditious with iespect to England, so insolent and gross towards the QuxEEr and the Comrinissioner, thst the session has had to be summarily cloted. It is, indeed, said that. Sir T. IAKTNr. , the celebrated " King ToW' of these islands, once closed thie Session in his shirt, having been surprised in bed -with the news that a seditious proposal -was about to be carried. What was called a free press has been used to vilify the English Government, to rouse the discontent of the population, and preach the, necessity of being attached to 'the Greek Kingdom underthe protection of Russia. Sir EH4imy WAnD, however, showved hinself capable of dealing. vith them. The wholesome severity with which he punished the attenipt at insurrection in Cephalonia had for a time the best effect, and his mode of treating his" ParlihaentV' was equally wise. The Chambers were never -allored to sit. They assembled, he made a speech, an addiess was moved, to which an insolent amendment was always carried, ana- then the Lord Higlh Commissioneo. prorogued them, and governed for the rest of the year on his own account. We should regret that this strict discipline, the only cure for the original evil of granting a Constitution, should be relaxed. If, however, the description given by a contemporary of a Iate scene in the Chamber be correct, it is high time that the Government should look to the maintenance of its authority. Ever since the beginning of the Russian War the Ionians have displayed more than their usual folly and insolence. When the contest appeared likely to be long and doubtful there was no concealment of their exultation, and since the peacetheirdisappointmenthasbeenloudly expressed. It would seem that the Indian mutiny has roused the spirits of the malcontents, for the outbreak in the Chamber is the boldest thing they have yet ventured upon. According to thia narrative, a M. D.&moLo stated in his place that there was a petition afoot to make Corfu a British colony-that is, to sever it from the Republic,:and subject it immaediately to the Cnow?. For this assertion it is now confessed there was no foundation; but it had the desired effect of giving occasion to a patriotic demonstration. Volumes of bombast followed. The Government officials, together with the President, joined in. the uproar. Mx AxvrkbiAcxr denounced the " infernal "scheme." ML LOmBARDO declared that " there "was no one in the islands who was " not horror-struck with the idea." MIany voices repeated, " There is none." " Not only," continued the speaker, " is every Ioniau ready to make " use of every means against it, but he is "wiUing, to sign vith a pen dippea in his own blood that union with Greece is our "sole wish aud desire." Here the President rose, and with him all the members of the House, crying with enthusiasm, " Yes, yes,yes !" " Let us, therefore; prove to the foreigner what we " have already proved, that what is ni6st grateful "to us is to get rid of his protection.". Then x Oux,a aenbiberi for Corfu, calls on the memnbers of the other six islanUs for a demonstration, and -they all rise up, shouting with enthusiasm. -f' Let us put aistop," -cries theK speaker, " t6.11 "' our proceedings as a proof of our senti"ments towards the Government and the "protection." Then- the- House appointed. a Committee of Inquiry-upon which LosxuARDO exclaims, "We have voted to-day unanimously our national resurrection. You "subscribe with your blood the union with Greece. " Who dare say now that theforeigner can find "any support in these islands7" Another Deputy. -"He can find none." The Advocate-General.- "We are a Greek inidependent State, like Greece, "the only difference being that we"are under "Briti3h protection. . - . The question when a "union with Greece and the whole naatio will "take place must be decided by time and cirunu"; stances." --r Now, this is the way in which the British supremacy is talked of by a set of men whose only title to speak at all is derived from thefavour of our own Government. The thing would be irritating were it not for the. utter folly andfeebleness of these noisy chatterers; who would be the first to make their escape if an outbreak were to follow their mischievous declamations. But because the Ionians are weak there is no reason that.we should allow them this liberty of abuse and turbulence year afteryear. There is no sayinghow far disturbances in other parts of Europe may not be encouraged by the spectacle of a people seerning to defy openly the power of England. This Constitution is now recognized as an absurdity, and should at once be suppressed. The Ionian Parliament has not the excuse of being a new and inexperienced assembly offending for the first time; it has indulged in these scandalous excesses continually, whenever it has been allowed to meet; and now it should be closed at once. Why are- we to carry everywhere into extremes the poliey of conciliating dependent races? We see the result in India as we see it among. the Ionians. We sincerely trust that if ever again there be an attempt at insurrection, this miserable pretence at a Republic will be swept away, and the islands declared CRowN. Colonies of the United .Kingdom. But we should not wait for such an occasion to abolish the Constitution so unnecessarily granted. The islands may very well be governed by the Lord High Commissioner and his deputies without any auch machinery as Lord SnAro attempted to create.
The 'question is no longer as to whether or no a Jow shall be admitted to vote in the Lower Ho4use of Parliament, but what is to be the result of a collision between the two Houses. There ean'be no doubt that the strengtb is with those 'who would aseep away the last rag of relDigous intolerance from our Parliamentary syateui. The advantage of time, perhaps, is on the side of their opponents. With all the. despatch that can. be used it wil be difficult to send Lord Jomn RvUszrWsBill to the Upper House in time for discussion, most probab for rejection. Still less will there be. time for the Comrons to arrive, at any decisive rsolution in case the Bill is rejected, unless the greatest unanimity and resolution prevaiL -The *to Xousea of Parliament are already n. collision. As matters stand at.present it is the onomoiCs who areo baffled, foiled, and defeatedit remainsto be seen if tbehtablei'can be turned in the ouri-'e of the next' three weeks, and if the Peers in 'their 'turn can be forced to surrende'r. -There must be a victory - and a defeat. *Theoiljudged obstinady of the' Peers' has' rendered any other solut4on m. p~Oab1e. ..heQ9 iacu. sibon! has' assumedl a "serlous 'aspet, for': -it is .'4<zl1. matez to *.eake.i 'thet ia'tijo-' rit of -eNr bac of :tIe Ie.latiure. titWe take: no't peatire 'in sc' a'u i:8ntei,co,n,, on' rtbe ~contt~ary, we-7Iold this i aident1tio be2 a; bi6s lamentable one. The Lords appear npon this occasion to have entirely mistaken their true positionin our modern Parliamentary system, which does not carry with it the right of absolute veto.

ThePeers cm no more afford to lag far astern of the Commnons thi3X1 the Commons can afford to lag astern of the country. Circinmspection, hesitation, delay even, 'will be pardoned, but no smalU section of the -community can now hope to maintain the cry of " No " surrender !" against the wishes of the majority, with any hope of ultimate success. A meeting of the Electors of the City of London was held yesterday at the London Tavern4 to conaider what course should be adopted under the present untowara circumstances. Baron Rorns.eLD addesised the meeting at some length. He was present, as he- told them, to redeem the pledge which he lhad given to his constituents at the last Election,-to. place his' seat at their disposal in mase the Lords should reject the Bill permittijg JeWs to sit and vote in the House !of -Commons which it' was then in contemplati6A. to send aup to them. That Bill has been sent ip, and, as everybody knows, has been. rejected. lBaron RomrsCHILD aecordingly stood forward to redeemhis pledgc. Some slight hesitation appeared in the first instance to'"prevail. as to whether or no this resignation. should7 be accepted, but in the end ite great weight of opinion was in favour of acceptance. The real meaning of this step is, that in the course of a few days Baron RoTHscHuD will bet again elected, again to present himself at the- table of the EHouse of Commons, again to claim admission or to 'suffer rejection. The new 'writ was moved last night. It is tupposed that when the Peers find the member of so influential and important a constituency knocking agrain and again at their doors, whilo the Commons 'at the same time are sending up oie Bill after another in the same sense, they may be at length aroused to a sense of their true position.' There is, of course, always room for hope that any body of men may in the end adopt a course which itis so unwise in them to refuse, but v;; are not, - we confess it, very sanguine as to tho'.resilt of this final experiment. The Peers h ave'regeathisBill-or one of a similar character-'omr 'tinies already, ana why should they give their.' assent to it the fifth time that -it is returned on their hands I The very same reasons which should induce their acqulescencenow should have had almost equal weight three weeks ago. The worst is, that as the contest has' been prolonged they have gradually taken up the position of partisans, with all the inconveniences inseparable from that clharacter. Pride is now combined with.prejudice. To retrace their sFeps is to inilict a wound upon their own dignity, or such, at least; would probably be their own view of the case. All the speeches -delivered yesterday at the London Tavern proceeded upon the-assumption that - Lord J. RussmL's Bill war to:: be tried- by way of a last desperate expeitent, and to coniince the country -how; flibnAly the Peers are resolved to'be in the wrong. We havej already-iated our obiectionto this ' ill Tme chie is, that- it admits a right to exist in the Peers, iv ich adimsio -must, be negatived if th Eue .lul afterwhrd~ resolve-to proceed bT he tpao lution. this i's imply a repetition-of3ihe hik #dOIf 4eror." HEdfthe Cbnnnons in£hd fartt instance qutetly and nno4MtAUily 1cteC -their Clerk to administerthe oath in a fdrm binding upon the conscience of a Jewish menber, we should never have been_troubled with this discreditable disc-sioni. Had it afterwirs- been discovered that the IHouse and the Courts of Law might at any- time comie into conflict in consequence of such decision tliere would have been io great difficulty in passing- a short Bill which would have remedied the incoxnvenience. Cases frequently aise in - legislation, as in the ordinary business of life, when it is far easier to obtain acquiescence in what has been done than permission to do a particular act. Tt should 'iiot be forgotten that if a collision between the House of- Comhmons and the Courts of Law is to be encountered, it is the Peers who will be ansierable for so uforiunate a contingency. The inore Lord CA3EPBEsL and those who think with him deprecate the disagreeable consequences which may eisne~ from such a contest, the morg are the Peers bound to avert it by allthemeans in their power. Itmaybetakenasa certainty that a conficf between the Commons and the Courts of Law will not be of long duration in gny case, but still it would be a result to be unfeignedly deplored. As to the legality of proceeding- in such a case by way of resolution, inde-pendently of the coramon sense of the case, we have in favour of it the present Attorney-General.- Sir RIcHnsD BETE=L, -whose authority -was quoted by Baron RoTrscmf 'at the meeting yesterday, gave some years ago an opinion upon this Aubject, to which he deliberately adheres. This it is :-"Baron- RoTrscHmD and Mr. "Alderman SAnoxoris havmg taken the Oaths "of Suiremacy and Allegiance, and. also the " Oath o;f Abjuration in the manner in which the "House is boiind b laiv to administer the same, are entitled to take their seats as members of "C'this H6use.` There are; of course, the decisions of the Codris of Law the other: way, and we fear it cannot be -disputed that in- case Jewish members should be seated by resolution the House of Commons must prepare for a conflict with the Courts. We wish we could hope:that the Peers, by a tardy coiicession, would prevent the'evil of such a dispute being inflicted on tlhe country. There is yet time to avert it, but, if the P>eers persist in their obstinae antagonisrc, at least there can be; no doubt ohwhose shoulders the responsibility rill rest.

KONE-Y-MABFTandOITYM UGENORE. --- ~~Thurday Evein. This has been another day of uneadness in the stock-maikets, and all persons appear to be antiol. pating evil newx. Consols opened at the lower pries of yesterday, and subsequently experienced a further fall, from which there was only a partial reoovery. The first trasactions for money were at 91j to J, whenoe they soon went to 91i to J. They then remained without chnge, although preenting a very unsettled appearance til the middle of the dsy, when all the bad rumours lately current wreo again revived, and. ales were effected at 91k, a tendency to panic being observable. A alight rally, however, aoon took plaoe, and the lut prices were 91k toi for money, and 911 to I for the 6th of August. The heaviness at the presentmoment seems satributable rather to a growing impresson that the next accounts from India will prove that the vlowtaken after the arival of the lat mil was too hopeful than to any susicion that disastrou3 Intelligence is already in the hands of private api-au lators. Yesterdaya fear that suchmight bethe Case wa very general, but it is felt that if anything had been received it would in the interval that has dnce elaped have asumed a poeltive characer. Bank Stockleftoffat 214j to 216; Reduced, 9litot; and New Three per Cents, 9l to ; India Stock decined to 215 to 217; and India Bonds are extremely weak at 20s. discount. The Exchequer-bill market is likewlse fat, the final quotation being 8e. to 2s. discount. Iu the Stock-Exobange to-day advances on GO. vernment securities were in request at from 5 to 5i per cent. At the Bank and in the discount-market there was also a full demand. The trnsactions in foreign ecurities havo been uulmportant, but prices on the whole are woll maned. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, have bceinegotiated at 100; Ohiian Six per Cents, 103; Mexican, for the account, 22* and 22- Russian Four-and-a-Rf Der Cents., 97; Spa ih, 40; for the account, 4; ditto, New Deferred, 25; the CertisxcateS 5; Turkd Sixper Cents., 95; ditto, Ifo# aecount, 9, -, and count,Fourwer Gnts.,98 and ' ;an for the account, 98j. The final g,uotations of the French Three per ents on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 90c. for money, ana 67f. 5c. for the end of the month, showing a fractional advance. The arrival of an Australian mail to-day was unexpected, the agent at Sydneyhavingdespatched the Simla a fortnight before her time to make up for the ma;l which, owing to the breakdown of the Oneida, had been omitted a forngt previouslya step whichit i feared will disarrange the future monthly service. The dates onthis occasion are to the 30th of Mlay from Melbourne, and consequently about fivereeks laterbthanthose recently brought by thavJamesBaines; but,asowingto the irregularity of the arrival, the cempany had no boat iting to receive the mails on tho Medierranean dds it is thought there may be considerable delay n the receipt of the letters Although the S touched at ylon on the 2Sd of June she brought no later Indian news. The datesfrom Calcutt bythe hat overland mail are supposed to have been to the 13th of J'une by telegraph vid Bombay, and as there is & telegraph from Calcutta to Mda, and the communication betreen Madras and Ceylon can be effected in a week or loss, it would seem to have been possible to have received upon this occadon at least three or four daya' later intelligence. It is to be supposed. however, that if any has been brought it is wrholly uniinportant, from its not having been tranmitted by telegraph this morning. The gold by the preent Austalianmal is only 40,5001,, but she brings intelligence of more than a million on its way. 406,504X. is on board the Great Britain, which aled from Nelbourne on i the 21st of MIay, and is now 63 days out. This i veel made her latpassage to Melbourne In 62 days, and she my therefore be expectod at any time. The remaining sum is 6O4,600l., which is on board the Indomitable, SwifUrre, Lightning, summer Cloud, and sardiran It appears that the Euphrates telegraph is about tobe commenced immediately. A largo quantity of telrph stores has been despatahed today for Bag ad, and Lieutenant Arthur Ha=we, of the East In Company's Service, and other Executive officers of the Euro n a Indian Juncton Telegraph Company, will start forthwith for that town to begin the construction of the propse line. The gold from NewYork by the Jason is 37,0001., and this vesEsel i5 the first of a forightly series that axe to make lIondon their port of arrivaL The latest advice. are by the Vanderbilt, which has aIso arved to-day, having left New York on the Uth of July. A further recovery had taken place in the stock-market, although the highest prices had not been maintained. Il1inois hCentral d advanced from 116 to 123, but had closed at 120I ; Reading were quoted 77i; and Erie, 27i ; lTew York Central had declined to 80g. The harvest promised well, with the exception of Indian corn, although, oDWinfg to the long continuance of cold and wet weather, it would be two or tbreo weeks later than usual. Wheat, barley, and oats wero likely to be abundant, and warm weather had at length set in. It was expected that the lateness of the harvest would delay the commencement of the autumn trade in imported goods. It is announced that the East India Company chartered yesterday Is large screw steamers, in addition to several clipper vessels, for the eonveyance of troops. The steamers consist of the Golden Fleece, of 2,700 tons, and the Lady Jocelyn, of 2,200 tons, belonging to the European and American Steam Company; the Australian, of 1,391 tons, the Sydney, of 1,391 tons, and the Victoria, of 1,897 tons, belonging to the Austalia Company; and the Scotland,? of about 1,800 tons, belonging to Mr. W. S. Lindsay. These six vessels, it Is thought, might carry a total of more than 4,000 men. The terms to be paid for the Golden Fleeco and Lady Jocelyn are 491. r man. For the others it is 431. 15. per man. No Golden Fleece and Lady Jocelyn will call at St. Vincent's or Rio to coal, the company having dep0ts at those stations. The ailing vessels engaged include the James Baines and Champion of the Seas, each of about 2,000 tons, and the Foreranner,-WarriorQueen, Ghengls Ehan, Vernon, and MIarlborough. At a special meeting of the NationalD)iscount Coin. pany today, Mr. F. W. Rusell, M.P., In the chair, the report and accounts for the past half-year were taken into consideration. The chairmnanB semarked that, notwithstanding the exaggerated rumours lately circulated, the company are in a position to repay 20s. in the pound to the proprictors In the event of its being wound up. mr. Coleman, one of the asuditors, dissented from thisview; the losses by bad debtsarcputatl6,000.; he thought they would reach 18,0001.; the preliminary expenses also form a large item, and if from the total of these aums the profits of the half-year, 15,3611., are deducted, there results a deficiency of 8,0001. He alo thought it lmprudent to lay out so large a sum as 18,0001. on building and iea. A long and desultory conversation folloMed, in the course of which the deputy- hairman t tMr Colemap conclusions respecting the loses by bad debts, and a lotter was read to prove that the company had secured a good bargamn in the purchaseof their premnies. A proprietor remarked that if the pail-up capital haa been left with the bankers on deposit, instead of employing it In discounts, the returns upon it would hve been larger. Ultimately the report and accounts were adopted by a majoritr of votes. Annexed is an abstract of the report. It will be notieed that the high value of money during thepastyearIs put as a plea for want of success, but it is not plain that this should neoessarly have operated ax a diadvantage :- . A stement of the accountg for the six months ending the 30th of June is annexed. The bill discounted from the ist ef JanUs to the 30th of June last mountedto 5,456,4UL; for the previous cx monts to 4^984,6520.; m a to of 1( , 4,oe during the st comple year frmmmnformAtiOn O fo theomPany.

"To several expienced men there does not ?ppear any n>eessity for this furtber delay. There is nothDig in the l sO decidedly objecionable but what may be amended in comlmttee. The returns required by the provionsof the Bill to be made once in every five years w place every life insunnce company upon the same beis s far aareg.r actual dat; , from which results miay be obtainled by qualified men, so as to ascertin thposition of any company, whether old or new, solvent or insolvent. " The Bill is earryingout the recommendations of some of the most eminent actuarie6 who were examined before the seect committee of the Hous of Commons upon the subject in 1853, and there real cannot be urged any valid reason for furter grocrastlnahon, other thau the desre to prevent any legiUa.ve enacbment for such companies " There is one decided objection to the Bill in It present form, as all companies, however established, except those formed undertheFriendl Socieies Acts, are to comeunder the provisions of the JoomsStock Companies Acts, which ray i many respects clah with the previous deeds of ettlenent of several companies, though there is a proviso in the Bil thAt - " iVii.

"Doubtless inthe progress of the Bill the promoters wil consider It desirable that the several cuses in the Joint.

RAILWAY INzTZLGEAY(c. MAi'A_ The half-yearly meeting of this company ws held yesterday at theLondonTavern; Maor-General D.Sip inthe chair.' The report, an abstact of which has appearedint 27. f'imeanwaw taken as read. The CHAImx&x, in mooving the sdo 'on of the report, said that the firet setion of their ]in% gf miles in length, Vdrin arloug and eavy monsoon, bad not sufferea e hanraiblways in this country. Ab other portion of toeir line, 16 miles in len1tS9 wax cnlened for trafrx on the7th of May, thus bringing 61 me into operation. iAurther portionwouldbe q panor o the endf: the year, which altogether would mak9e 100 miiles open for traffic. But that would give them ouly a Tery imperfect idea of whrat bad been done by ibeir taf,a they hbad between Velore and Beypoor 30 egneers engod on several parts of the ine which were now t hy 'or the permanent vm ehad nodoubt The linewould becomp letd from oat coast before the end of 1859. The onLy worls that would dehy them were the brldgein. cons ence of the difficulty in maklng the requie quanti o ef bue t he bad no doubt the works in every deprtment wouIh be -presed forward as eagerly as ponible. Their traUffic returs had boon made up for thee-quarters of a year from the opening of the line, and the traffoi for the remadsg fourth quarter would soon be made up. The first quartr ha produced 56,68r,, the seeond 7m1ies., the third 70,486r. and the fourth he believed wold reaize 80 , togr eier 278,318r., oir the rint year. The pssenger"trafic was mot so great as they had expected. There were various reaons why the traffic had not been greter. In the irst olace,, th line had not -yet beon extendod far enoug6 into the interior to induce the traffic ot the country to be conveyed by the railway. A are porto of the good traffic cameom places situate between 0hend 300 miles from their pr en t terminus, Ob the carriers Of the country arriving with thelr loed at Arcot, which wts only 65 mies from Madras, and having a good road all the way, they go an to Madra,r 'wt te Theo taining a return load. Nopeople, perhap, were more tenaious of theirhabitshand toms than th peoloIntat part of India. The chares for conrvoyaneo on the road bec tween Arcot and Madras had been reduced 40percent., and the road was as full of trafil ag ever. He thought, however, that the safety, rapidity and cheapness of railway communication mut prvail, and that when the line was 4completed it would conmand the whole traffic of the district. The inconverient hou Df starting the trains from Mada and Aroot bad an i5iuous effect on their passnger traffic, and the fare fixed by the local Government were probably too low. The directors of the companK had proposed a hiher rateof fare, and they hoped teir application woldbe acceded to Government,wno, no doubt, tho "t a low byathe beatdfras ffkf eAhRBraina sechondl rate beet for theao railway, As the traffic till derto the old route. There ws no perceptible difference on the road, except that tho railway had stimulated the traffic. There were difficulties in the way of developing the traffic, and no douta tho lower their fares the more nffect they would have on their competitors. He was gdh{ to sy that most positive instructions were snt out to the MAdras Government tointerfereas little as possible with the worming of the traTic. They were expeced by the Home Government to see that no money was uselemsly expended during bconstrucdon, but when the raiway was completed the manaepment would be left to the railway officials. If those inastrctions of the HEon. Court of Directors were followed out he d no doubt the traffoof theailwaywouldverymuchincreae. Themr was another line to the north-west which was being sur- toyed, and it was found that up to Cuddaph there was no difficoty in contructinu a raway. Ther e were also surveys being made rid Neilore. Both surveys would be submitted to the Government to decide which of the two should be constructed. Mfr. ARBuTHNOT, in scndtg the mtinao for their aoption of the report, said It had been reprersted elsewhere that the proress of their works ws slow; but, as sta btheircEhAirnma it appeare athat 4 mles wou abe com. IeTted in the course of two yearis The work on the line were proreing on nearly every part over the whole di Tnea the permanent way materils for the whole inte d b,aen shpped to India. He believeds that such worko couid not be completed sofner In any other aart of the world than t'hey could complete thema. He did not think thl charge of slwpoess would apply to them. He was tuito sure they would dhe vnodifficultyhin anrying the line tr ogh assoon as possible. Mr. limwter did not think the report satisfactory, inas. Inuch as six months had been alowed to hlape siance the shanholders had passed a rolution complaining of the ll n tbference of the local Goernment in t e management of the traffic without anything effective having been done to prevent it. The blame rested somewhere; and it appeared to him a monstrous thing for theloa Government to inter. fere with the running of thoh trains so as even to prevent passen era retureing on the same day. Dr. BEAT= thought the report anything but satisfactor. Under such tnterference they could nmever extet the rail. way to paya dividend beyond the gurantee, If the inter ferenoe were to continue they could dispen ewith a ther hoard of directors and the Goverment could manage it for them. Mor. Norftox estimated that the traffic on their line would notyield above 8 per cent. If the interference were contnued. He thought the shareholders sDhould not relax in their efforts to obtain the managment of their own pro. pej; CHAInitI said with respect to the traffic returns being so small it didnot arise sozmuchbfrom theIlow fares afromearrying onlyaverysmallportion of thetraffic. The Government had fixed the rates and fares forthe first year, and all the directorswanted wasto be allowed to revistherates andfar forthe scnd-ear,andtrythe effect. Revised rates bad been submitted and be trusted they would be allowed to take effect from the 1st7ins. They also applied to the Goverm-ent for permisslonto run mied transsoastoworkthetrafflctomore advantage, and also to leAve, the workng of the railwayithe hands of the railway officials. They asked fr prmision toraunmixed trains, goods and p ngers, milesanhou, the sped -being now lmd fokDerg tri ......ns to 10 miles an lhour. - In epl toqustins t ws tatd tatthe balance in ban wa no abut 60,001, ad tatthe next call would bee th 4 pe cet.shaes,bu coldnot be mlade before hnext October. The report was then unanimously adopted. After some discussion, lb. Lwx proposed a resolution to the effect that the prohibition of excursion trains on Sunday was not advisable or rendered necessary by the demand. of Chrisianity. The motion baving been seconded Mr. LxzGRonoved as an amendment that the motion beomot pet to the maeeting. Theamendmentwas carriedbylarU majority, and the motion was negatived. A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors conciuded the proceedings. TRAYRIO RETURNS. Mil1es Pas. ifer- Total, Tlotal oe.sea. em baudise. 115. 1556. WeekendingaJuly U.

The nomination, he aid, took place on the 27th and the polling on the 28th of March There were four candidates, two of them, Mr. Cobbold and r en being Conservatives, and two, Mr. Adair and 3MIrsomu%xna beinz Liberal& The constittLencyr of IpS.

Thenumber of votes polled by therespecttve candidates was as follows:-Cobbold, 780; Adair, 759; 1.1arsham, 738; Selwyn, 707. It would, however, be proied that the majority of Mr. Adait had been obtaUedi by biribery and other corrapt and improper means conunittea, not by Mr. Adair personally, but by his known and recognized agents. Up to about 2 in the afternoon of the polling-day the numbers polled by Mfr. Adair and Mr. Selwyn wero about equal, but between that hour and the close of the poll at 4 34. Adair gained the majority he had mentioned; and .was, with Mr. Cobbold, dpclared duly elected. Theelection hadbeen conducted bytheliberalparey by means of comnittee3, and they had one central and fife district committee.roomn He would now- mention the names of threo gentlemon who would be found to have taken an active partoon the lileral side. They wereMr. Henry Lawrance a solictor, Mr. Loit, and Mr. Head, the agents for the electton expenses of the Liberal candidates. Two other persons, named- John Smilh, a tailor, and Charles Cooper Mulley, -wouidbe shown to have been the agents of Blr.A41r. The learned counselthonmentioned thoenumbera lledbytheretive candidates at different hours in the y. thalf past1 Mr. Selwyn stood next to Mr. Cobbold, and Mr. Aduir and Mr. ar-sman were in a minority, but by 3 o'clock Mr. Adair had obtained a majority of nine over Mr. Selwyn. At that hourthe Liberal party showed signs of extraordmy acutivity, and were observed to send aboat cabs In every direction. Onestepwhichtheytookwouldrecllold elections to the remembrance of the committee. Walter Mulley, the sonof Charles Mulley, was sentto the bank for a be of money, and then the voters who had been fetched In ca s wer not taken direot to the pbll, but first visited Ur. Adait's oommittee-room, and afterwards recorded their votes. The learned counsel proceeded to mention some of the pr pal cases upon which he Intended to rely.' It wouldbeproved that two poorimen named Cook and Green wrere withou.t any money on the morning of the election; t ey went to the Iberal comrnittee-room, where they EaW Smith; that they were put into a cab; that money was gven them; and that they were then taken to the polL T wo othermen, Barber and Charles Smith, were bribed In a ssboorammtte.-rcom previous to voting. 3. Smith, the tailor, togetherwith another person, named Bedford, en deavoured to bribe a man named John Cook and to keep him by force in the Waggon and Horses, where there was a Sub-committee-room, when they found he would not vote as thel desired. Abbot, a man who voted just before the close of the poll, had been promised 40s. byMaley and 30s. by Becford. A milkman named Garnan bad been heard to say that he would not voto under a " fiver," but he observed after he had polled that he had only rZeceived 11. after all. The 13ughesew, father and two Eons, were bribed by the payment of upwards of 61. beyond their real travellimg expenses from London, Mulley being the person from whom they received the money. These men however, ertrated a gross fraud, for, although they had been sent or ]y Mr 3 they went to Mr. Cobbold's commitee, and got their traveling expenses paid a second time. Treatng had been practised on an extenive scale; a number of refreshment tickets had been issued, and signed with the Inital of Mulley. The inquiry would not, he the ht, be a protracted on, and, notwithstanding the difflicuties of zoving rgency tereaa by the recent Act, he had no doubt at he ala be able to prove to the satisfaction of the -mmtteoer Vaat ces- AdWsmajority had ken obtained by itg e ual formal evidence having been given as to the writ and the return, Samuel Barber was called. He said he was a wheel. Wright and a voter of Ipswicb. The committee-room of the Liberals In Queen-street was covered with yellow placads, on which vrers the names of Adair and Marahman. -e saw Bdford and Smith, the tailor, going in and out of the committee-room. At 3 in the afternoon on the polling day he met Bedford and Smith near the Post-office, and told Bedford that he had a vote, and he should be glad if he could do anything for him. Bedford, after speaking to Smith, offered him 30s. Witness sid,- " Give me a couple of pounds and I am your man." He went with them to the Waggon and Horses tap, which was kept by his mother. He went into a back room, where he saw Bedford, who pointed to a srew of paper on the mantelpiece. He un. - crewved the paper, took two sovereigns out of it and ptn -theminhi lspoce, and then went-and voted -for- Adali and farshinan. Abouti week afterwards he met Bedford, who said to him, "If7ou blow the gab yOU know what you wil The witness was cross-examined by Mr. B. JSA8 at considerable length, and admitted that be had been five or six times in Ipswich Gaol for debt, for furious driving, and on susoicion of stealing and receiving goods knowing them to be itolen. He had gone tothe White Horse about his evidence a week after the eection. It was taken down in wriEu in theresenoe of Brlstow, one of the petitioners, le h asome randy and water nd two sovereigns given him before he signed it. He could not swear whether Bris. tow was presentor not. Hadley gave him the money. He denied thaw be had been drinking that morning. On re-examination he said he had never been Imprisoned inconsequence of a conviction by a jury. Hadley was a ticket-of-leave rn. He had gone over to the Yellows. Mr. B. Backhouse, an engineer, produced a plan of the Waggon and Horses, for the purposeqof proving that a person standing in a certainprivy there was able to see into a room at the back of the tap. William Thurlow stated that at 2 o'clock on the polling day he wentinto the privy described by -the last-witness at the back of the Waggon andfHorses;tbat he saw Bedford, who was In the small room at the back of the tap, take something from his pocket, put it into a pioce of paper, and place it on the mantelpiece; and that he then saw Barber come into the room, take the piece of paper from the shelf, and put it Into his pocket. He also heard Bedford tell Barber to put the money In his pocket and go and vote. On crossxamination the witness said he had been sent for by Mr. Bristow, the petitioner, to whom he had made thisnsktement of what he had seen and heard. Briatow gave him half-a-crown after hearing his statement. He chargedBriatow another half-crown for]loss of time. He had chaffed Barber about this business. Re-examined.-Bristow heard about it in consequenco of his having chaffed Barber. He had lost insteadof gaining anythingby the statement he had made. -Since maing it he had lest his employment. Jeremiah Osborne, a slater, who had been employed as a doorkeeper by the tiberals at the last election, said he was engageqd a fortnght previous to the election at the Waggon and Horses. He saw Frazer, Long, and Mills there. Frazer told him to go to the central committee-room for pens and paper. Hle was told to go the committee-room early-the next morning. He went and saw Mulley, the hairdresser, John Smith, the tailor, Bedford, Abbott, Dennant, Wills, and other persons.

He remained In the yard and saw Smith gtve Barber somo thing which looked like paper.

Dennant bold him he was to go to his house by the direction of Charles Cooper Mul1y. A few days after the election he saw Mulley, J. Smith, Bedford, and others at Mr. Adair's committee-room.

THBE BEP1MESENTATIOR OF LONDON. A public meeting of the electors of the city of Londonl was eld at the London Tavern yesterday, to consider what steps should be taken in consequence of the rejection by the House of Lords of theParliamentary Oaths Bill. Baron RoTsHSOnID attended the meeting, and announoea his intention to resign his eat in ccordance with a yIedge 'which he gave to the citizens at the last election. The appearce of the baron on the platform was the sigal for an outburst of loud cheers. The large hall was crowded with electors, and among the leading gentlemen present were-Messrs. W. G. Prescott, W. Pritchard, J. P. Gassott, Igramus Travers, E.C. White-. hurst, S. Morley, A. S. Ayrton, ALP., W. Tite, MLP F. W. Russell. 3LP., K. D. Hogsn, XLP., IL W. Schnfder, MP., J. White, MY., R. W. ° rawford, M.P., Alderman Bslomons, Messrs. . Bennoch, I. Bateman, G. Offor, Dr. Chalice, &c. Mr. W. G. PRScoln, having been -oted into the chlir, opened the proceedings by briefly recapitulating the circum. stances which had led to the convening of the meeting. Raving explained that the principles they contended for were civlU and religious liberty and the right of the consti. tuencies to choose thdr own representatires,he counselled the nse of temperate language, combined witlh firmnees of purpose, as the best means of carrying their object, and then caUed upon Baron RoTHscm to address the assemblage.-The Baron, who spoke at considerable length, began by obseer. Ing that when the citizens of London last conferred on him the honour of reprning him as one of their representatives he enterei into a pledge that if the House of Lords agin rejectedfthe Oaths Thu he should &6. the earliest mnoment place hisseatattheir disposal. He tood there that day to redeem this pledge, andto state thatbis seat wasnowattheir disposal. (Cheers.) It was his intention to ask for the ac ceptanceofhisresignation.andfo5theisme)fz.new writ, and it would be for the elector: to say what course they Intended to rsue. (Hear, hear.) HIe would have relinquished his seata fortnight ago, immediately on the rejection of the Bill, hut, having conferrd with several of hissfriends, and askedtheleadersof his party in the House of Commons whether any other step could be taken, he had been per. suded by them to wait for a few days. Aconsouation was held vith the legal advisers of the Crown oni the sabject of seating hfi by resolution. The Attorney-General was stil of the same opinion In favour of the legality of such a xesolution as he expressed a few 7ears ago when the question came before thelHous of Commons. (E[ear, hear.) That hon. and learned gentleman then moved "That Baron Rothschild and Mr. Alderman Salomons, having tlen th oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and aso the Oath of Abjuration, in the manner in which this House Is bound by law to administer the same, are entitled to take thiiettsmmer fti os, (Hear, hear.) Such was the opinion of Sir B. Bethell several years ago, and it continued, he believed. hs opinion to the present day; bht the objections of te hon. and learned gentleman to this measure now were, that it would plae the House of Commons In an awkward position towards the courts of law. That, however, was but a secondary consideration (cheers), and a consideration which should be left with the Houso of Commons. It was for that House to decide whether their power was second to that of any other branch of the government of the country. 'He believed that every elector, and almost every man In En land, would say that the House of Commons ought to be the first power in the State. (Cheers.) The communications with t'he Attorney.Gveneral, however, caused a delay of several days; and Lord J. Russell a informed him of his intention to bring in anotherBill during the present session. It was very unusual, according to Parliamentary practice, for two meaures to the same purport to be introduced in the same session. The ca muast be a very important one to justify such a proceedin; and so it was regarded by the noble lord. The discussions on Lord 3. Russell's Bill had been of thegrea,estuseto their cause. Hear, hear.) A motion was also put upon the table by t eir friend Mr. Dilwyn (cheers), which It took several days to consider, and both of these measures were still before the House. But, after violent debates on a great question like thls a certain pau alwaya ensued, when tiune was given for refecion. This wa te point at which they had now arrived. DiscuLs. sions had taken place on the two motions to which he had referred; those motions were now being considered by the members of the other House of Parliament and by the country at large; and it would be seen whether the publios wlodnot come forward to support Lord W. Russell and Mr. Dillwyn in carrying their measures. (Hear, hear.) TseLanation would, he trudsted, sufrice to exonerate him for not presenting himself to the electors at an earlier period, and would prove that he could not fairly be accused of not having fulfilled his promise to the letter. (Cheers.) few words on the main question before them. 13 e would not say that disappointment only, but su2rise, had been merLuyelttt late decision of the House of Ltords. o doubt the House of Lords were exercising their constitutional right in throwing out this Bill, and might continue to.throw it, If they chose, for ever. (Mur. murs.) But it might be asked whether the peopie h not their constitutional rights (cbeers)-whether it could be politic on the part of the House of Lords not only to pay no attention whatever to repeated demonstrations of the oIn!ion of that conatituency, but no attention to a majority o140 ofthe House of Commons? (Renewed cheers.) The number of members p resent when this quesidon was last debated In the louse of Commons was greater than it h been for a very long time before- and therefore the decision come to was the decision of the whole Eouse and In a new ParHament. Morcover, wa3 no attention whatever to be pidd-ko-the wishes of the Gdverment? (Hear.) They had thus the Government, the people, and the House of Commons, all opposed td wrfom? to asection of theHouseof lords (cheer3)-to themen who went bUt very seldom among the people, who knew not the wishes of the people, and who, in fact, attended to vepv little butthefr own plesre and amusemen. (" Bra,vo Fe ws sure that when these persons began t re'fect they woald soon change their opinions. The only argment used against the ad in the Upper House was this:-" We have not seen any rots, we havenot been complled to way as wre were on three great occaifons,-viz., on the aasgnof Catholio emancipation, on the passing of the eformBill, and on the repeal of the Corn Laws." " If," as one member of Parliament said, " we saw the soldiers in the streets, then we would give y." Now, he as3ed them, even in the present state of things, if this argument could be tale hed to our distant do minions in India, what efwould it be 13kefytohave there? What effect would beproduced if our Indian fel low.subjeotg should read Intihe nwppers the saltement of Lord Derby and his followers ht they woldot yeld to what the Bishop of London eclared had right and justce on Its side, because they were not compelled, because there were no tumults in the streets? What a responsibility these who urged such a plea against any measure incurred I He trusted that we should have good news from the East, but he had put the case hypothetically as he had done to show how absurd and ridiculous was the argaument used by so distinguished aman as the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. (Cheers.) With regard to the progress which their cause was maklng, lie verily hbe Heved that this question now stood on a better foot. ng in the House of Commons than it ever had done. (ear., hear.) On it, side it had a greater body of deter. minne Liberals than were in the lastParllament, andhe was convinced that they had only to pul together to gain their point. If Lord J. Rgussell'sBill should be withdrawn, if another Bill should be rejected as before by the House of Lords, he was satisfied that the House of Commons would then seat him by resolution. (Cheers.) The feeling of the House was such that it would no longer, ield up its rights and privileges. (Renewed cheers.) A'usions had been made to his private character in the House of Lords. He referred to what Lord Derhv said as to a Jew filling the office of Chancelor of the Exchequer. Such personal remasrkj he treated with the greatest oontempt. He paesed nearly al his time in the cty of London among his friends, who Were acquainted with his habits and his character; and he valued their respect and esteem far morethan anyDrises he could receive on the other side of Temple-bar. Cheers.) One observation as to Lord Palmerston. That noble lord, until within a few days of the second reading of the Oatbs Bill, vas confident of its success; and although the Govem. niant might be accused of not having put on the screw as tightly as they ought to have done-although they did not take care to secure the votes of the foreign ambassadors, 10 of whom were, he believed, on the continent-although they might have omitted in this instance what had been done on former occasions, still they could not wellplace any blame on Lord Palmerston's shoulders. The noble viscount, as often happened with a man in high position, who had perhaps too great a power in the House of Commons, was over-sangine of success,.and thought that his great authority and his numerous aupporters ei the Lower Chamber would give him more influence thai they had done with the Rouse of Lords. (Hear, hear.) -He had now only to thank them for their kid indulgence, and to add that he appeared before them as a candidate for the honour of beDg again elected one of their representatives. (Loud cheers.) Mr. S. MioxIaRLE rose to move the first resolution- That thismeeting, havinogberd from Biron onel do RothJchBd his determiation to reign his mat in Farliaient, pledges itself to use its mlost earnest endeavours to Insure bis reelection, ua a p,roef of the usalterable attachment of the electors of London to the cauise whicht rabrB ecomimenided hinm to their euff-agee. eought no longer to be allowed to be played withbyD these ,two noble lord. (Cheers.) Mr. B NOCI,in secondling the resolution, sadd, that they had no other mode of continuing their protest against the usurpation of the House of Lords hut by again returning Baron Rothschild to Parliament. It would seem that their Lordships wished to hound the citizens on to arevolution be. fore they would concede to them their civil rights, Mfr. H.L BATxaLsr asked whether it would not be better to postpone the acceptance of the Baron's resignation untlthey saw the fate of Lord T. Russell's Bill. ("N-o,no I") Mr. CRAw.MoXt, MYP., said, that the Baron and his friends had carefully considered this point, and-came to the conclusion that a new election ought to take place without delay. The earliest day on which the second raig of Lora . Russell's Bill could be taken would be Wodn as next. Let the Baron, therefore, be again.returned in thfe meanwhile and present himself at the table to take the oaths inthe form most binding on his conscience. Another refusal of his right to sit could. not fall to strengten the supporters of the noble lord's Bill. Should the Bill, how. ever, be again rejected by the House of Lords, the independent 3nembers could then show the Government 'that they were determined to take the matter into their own hands. (Cheers.) The reslution was then puat and carried upanimously. -Mr. W. 3.

There was no reason whry tbisgreat measure, which had been too long tonsedlke afootbllbetwnthenoblelord and the noble viscount, should not be carried through In a week. With a proper display of earnestness and determination the fors of the ouse would enable the noble lord to convert ? sham" commencement into a stern reality. The hon. member concluded by movlng a vote of thanks to the chair. man. Mr. SOHXDBE, M.P., believed that Lord Palmerston was earnest at least about one thing-the retention of power. (A laugh.) Let the Premier only be maae to foeel that his tenure of office depended on the passing of this mneasure, and they might rely upon it Baront 1othschild would be speedily allowed to take his smat. (Cheers.) ur. Alderman SALoxoos rose amid loud criles of "White" to address the meeting. He described himslf as a martyr in that cause, and characterized the question as a constitutional g.uestion, and as a case of judge-niade law. He was ex~p2g the origin of the Oath o *urabton, and pointing out that it was introduced to exclude tho Jacodites, when he was Interrupted by a loud cry of "Question, raied by apreeeding eaker. "It igbhghly indecent," exclaimed the worthy Alderman, with Pome warmth, "in Mr. Ha whoce attack upon the House of Lords was patiently Ifened to, to refuse me a hearing." Resuming the thread of his discourse, Mr. Salomosa referred to the Act which declares that any person holding office or entering Parliament without taking the Oath of Abjuration should incur thd penalties of outlawry, besides forfeiting the sum of 50W. There had never been a conviotion under that statUte except the one against himself. Asa loyal sub jeothe had takentheOath of Abiuration, nd had thusgivew a guarantee that he was not a Jacebite. Yet he waz the onlyperson who had suffered under this Act. That might be wl, but was it ustice t (Cheers.) - Mr. Wmur, lLl., pnted to the Interest taken inthis question by the borough which he represented (Plnmouth)as evidencing a growing feeling in the provinces In favotr of. the removal of this " Last rag of intolerance.n If Lord '. Russell were really honest in this eause, he had only to tell the Premier that after the necessary supplies had been voted he meant to interpose al the forms of the Hous against ev other motion until his Bill was placed at the top of thelt and then the standing ordersmight be suspended on its behalf. (Cheers). The v.ote of thans to the chairman was then cared by alaation, and the meeting dispersed.

EscAn: sno0 PaIsoN.-Conslderable excitement was caused inleawcstle.on-T ne on Wednesday morningby the escape of four desperate characters-three of them charged with highway robbery, and the other with attemptedmurder-from the borough gaol during the :glht. It appears that about half-past 2 o'look in tho morning a polceman named Telford was passing the east end of the gaol, when he noticel several rugs and. sheets, knotted together into a rope lying under the wall upon the footpath and, Vpecting that they belonged to *hat building, ana that they had been ued by some prisoners to effect their escape, he gave an alarm and aroused the gaoler and tur keys. They at once identifiea the rugs as belonIng to the gaol, and upn examining the cells they ascertained that George BI W.nsb ip an d Blacekstone Hind, wbehwere await. Iug their trial At the aseicsfor ahighway robbezy upon a broker's clerk, from whom 23L habeen stolen;V Wliam Beaumont Hays, a tfcket-of*leave convict chagead with a garotte robbery* and Johl Harris, charged with attempting to murder his wkie, four deperaterafsna anaverypowerfs men, had escaped. How they escaped has been cleaely ascertained. About half-past 6 on Tvesday evenin Mr. Woife, a solicitor, to whom tbey had intruate their defence, came to conslt with Winashipand Hind, and had conversed with them through the gate of their ward. The other two prisoners were in the yArd with them at the sametime. The upper turnkey had kave of absence on Tuesday evening, and as Mr. Scaffe was li}ely to have a long conulatation with the prisonersj a as he mnaginedhe was Also retained by the other two men, and wnted to taik withthem, hef asked the under-turnkey to lock them all up in their cells atter Mr. Scaifo left. This official had forgotten to do so, and they;had the full range of theirvard aadauexolentopportunityforscapd e -u p ,the night. They had gOt over the 7ard wal into the ao garden, and thence escaped into the sIone-tard. They ,then clambered on to the roof of the workshops, and, havlnt reached the rain wal of the building. theydroppa themselves upon the street b a rope made of their rugs.

We have. received the following ;telegraphic despatos from our Paris correspondent :: * "PARIS, FRIDAY, juY 24, 8 A.tr. "ThelWonifeaur annouinces that ths rubioar which has been circulated of the dea atcb. of Frenofi troops to China is entirely witho;ut foundatio,2" EXPRESS PRoZ ?An S-. The folowing is, the letter of .our :Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Thursday),.6'p.m.:_ An absurd report' haws .cbcilated for'thetlast few dlays to the effect that General Cavaignac :had been arrested, and that he is. now can,flh& in iome mysterious dungeon. It is hardly necesaauy. to&aay.that ther¢ is not' sword of truth-in thisru3mour. General Cavaignac has not b'eenin Parii nanj week 'he was not here even diring the elc;tions; He is residing on a small property near Chateatidu LoHe, in the department of the-Sarthe, with liii famnily, and concerns himself very little -with public affairs. He is, in fact, living in the utmost tram_ ,quillity. Without being very opulent he is in posEcssion of an ainple iicme, which has been increasedcby the death of his uncle, and in other respects he is to all appearance among the most contented of men. He took no part in.the late elections beyond'plhing his name at the:disposal of his political friends. Forthe presoethis chief occupation seems to be in superintending the building of a small pavilion on his grounds. The house he occupies is sriall, and. General Cavaignac wishes to have a spare room or two for the accommodation of a fewiriends who may bappento visit him. TbiB is the onlydurance to which he is reduced. Three agents attached to the ISecret Pollce of Paris left yesterday for Genoa, whence they proceed to Leghorn and Naples. Their '-i-in is said to ba connected with -the late insurretionin Italy. The Ministerial journal, Le Pays, gives the following explanation of the alleged conflict between the French soldiers at R-ome and the Pontifical troops:- "On learning the events of Genoa ana NTaples, some obscure demagogues, seeing that tbe wero nablo to do anything at Rome, attemptedUto excite tho Pontifical troops against or soldiers, who have been always remarksble for fbeir blameless conduct and their excellent discpline. Colonel Ysuni, who comimands the Pontifical army since the death of Gener,i Farina, took the most energetic measures to maintiin order, and, with the exception of three or four isolated cases without importance, but repressed with determination, and in vwbieh it was proved that the aggression, did not emaanate from our men, no farther dis. order occurred. All was promptly terminated, and the Roman people on this as on former occasions testified to the mnerits and the good spirit of our troops." The official jodrsial of Naples announces that the Ring, desirous of compensating the inhabitants of the island of Ponza for the sufferings endured at the hands of the insurgents during the invasion of the 27th of JTuano, has ordered that a sum of 2,000 clucats s be annually appropriated to the execution of public works in the island. A suiM to the same amount is also to be distributed among the most necessitous of the population and, those who have lost most by the insurgents. A telegraphic comnuunication is to be establiahed between the islands of Ponza and Ischia. A letter from Pisa, of the 20th inst., mentions that several persons had been arrested in that and other towns of Tuscany. Accounts from Parma state that further attempts had been made by -Mazzini's emissaries to excite disturbances, but in vain, and that the people, having been-so frequentlj deceived, were .Aeterminid not to 'place anj'Iconfi: dence in Mazzi. ' . ' The pupils of the Waval College at Genoaw ere to Jembark on the 21st on the brigsi Erclana and Aquila, on an experimental cruise.- They are to touch at Algiers, the coast of Spain,14MAeira,aud Teneriffe. A letter from 3Iilan, of the 15th, says that, although the silk crop is gathered-in the greater part of Italy, the amount of the produce is still uncertain One fact, however, is ascertained-that the crop is not so deficient as was apprehended. All the foreign seed prospered. The seed raised in Lombardy, on the contrary, generally failed. The spinners and holders of a stock of sik say that the crop is bad. Speculators pretend that it is much better than last year. Everybddy speaks according to his interests and his wishes; but it is generally believed that prices will be loiwer than last year, and that silk at present is a hazardous speculation. By a decree of the Minister of War, dated yesterday, Generals Simneon, Labadie, De Bousingen, Yotier, and Loreton-Dumontat have ceased to appear on the list of generalson active service. Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria, Run addressed a memorandum to the Emperor by the last mail, in which he reviews all the advantages which may be derived by the late expedition against the Kabyles. The Protestants of Vendome, not possessing a chapel, hired some tirh& ago a room in the town for public worship, and engaged M. Cadier, a Protestant minister of Orleans, to officlate for them. After the second celebration of divine service, M. Cadier and 18 members of his congoregation were prosecuted by the local'authorities before the Tribunal of Correctional Police of the town, on the charge of having violated the law on associations and public meetings, by not having obtained the authorization of the Government for their meetings. They were all convicted,- and condemned to pay jointly a fine of SOf. Three days ago they-appealed to the Imperial Court of Orleans against this condemnation, and the Court quashed it, for the technical reason that, if the defendants had done wrong, they had violated, not the law on associations and meetings, but that on offences committed in the exercise of public worship, and that consequently it was before the Council of State, and not before the Corre lot ar-unal;'thaS 'teparties ought tco have been cited. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- et " .ASEILLES, Juty 22. "Intelligence has been receivedfromConstantinopleto the 11th (the date already received vid Trieste). " The Sultan has authorized the creation of a high road from Beyront to Damascns.

After the religious service the Royal family were conducted to their carriageswiththe same ceremonial, and returned to the Palace. The King of the Belgians at a later hour gave audienco to the Count d'Archinto, who had been sent on a msion extraordinary by the Emperor of Austias to make the official demand of the hand of the Princess Charlotte for the Archduke Maxiinilan. The reception took place with great ceremony. The Count d'Archinto'and his fecretaay were conveyed from and to the HOtel de Belle Vue in Court carriages. After the audience His Majesty received Baron de Linsingen, the Eanoverian Minister, and other personages of distinction. . RUSSIA. (FROM OUR MEI=l. CORRlOXDM2U. BERLIN, JuLy 22. Li the absence of the Emperor and Empress, the Empress-Mother, aiid thie Grand Duke Michael, life in St. ,Petersbiurg seems just now, if we may judge bv the St. Petesburg journals, and such few private letters as nofw fex s ti3 froni that capital, to be very "alow"indeed. Business seems to bebrisk according to the cormm.cisal reports,f but there come numerous holydaye firom tim'e to time and interrupt its profitable course. Thus in the middle of the 'month the' -gcot' 'folks of St. Jetersbu;g had l three clies nson: consecutively the lI-th wat 'St. Pete"ci'a St.'PMi's Day, thae 12th 'was A Sundays and the. IthI the' birthday; of the Empress-Mother, on' which occasion there were, as usual, popular rejoicings on the ssIands.. The less material, however -the- Rusian journalists find in the.presOnt'thd more usetthey seemjust now to make of the futre.; and- their colamns are replete with announcements of great things that are to take place some day. The Emperor is confidently expected back in his own dominions at the 'end of this month, and it was believed, that. he would on this occasion return home by way of Warsaw, and in thab case, go on to Mosow, 'where military manceuvres on a large scale are about to be held. The activity of the Grand Duke Constantine in-the exercise of the sovereigna powers delegated to':him. seems to leave the Emperor-little or no reason for hurrying back to the seat of Government, where he has for so long been so strenuously occupied in' carrying out the various reforms resolved on. The Grand Duke Michael will certainly return home by way of Warsaw, of which, it is presumed, he is to be the Stadctholder as soon' as his marriage with the Princess Cecilia of Baden has been solemnized. He will, on leaving there, proceed to inspect the various fortresses in Poland, and in the Western Governmenits of Russia, and subsequently return to St. Petersburg, where great progress. is being made in the palace that is being built for him there. .1' The new census, which the Emperor in his coronation manifesto promised to his people, with a view to a more equable eistribution of the fiscal burdens, has been ordered by a ukase, dated June 1X; and the Journal of the Senate pablishes the necessary instructions for the process in 10 separate'sections, which occupy no less than 20 printed pages. The census is to be' commenced in everygovernment the very same day as 'the instructions arrive there, and must' be completed everywhere within 12 months, with the exception of Stawropol and Siberia, for which districts 14 months are allowed. For Bessarabia and the TransCaucasian territory a special form of instructions is to be elaborated. The only persons excepted from this enumeration of the people, (which it is evident is synonymous with liability to taxation) are the tobility; allemiplogg fii he ierV[ce of the 'tate,;all persons in possession of honorary citizenship, the entire force of the active army, the Cossack and Baschkir armies, and the personnel of the Court. Lord Wodehouse has availed himself of the op. portunity afforded by the absence of the Emperor and Court from St. Petersburg to pay a somewhat lengthened visit to Moscow. One of the bridges on the St. Petersburg-Moscow line, which had been constructed of wood at a time when iron bridges were not so general as now, has lately taken fire and been burnt down. The railway from St. Petersburg to Peterhoff. was put into requisition for the first time on the 7th inst., when it conveyed the pupils of the Military Cadets' Academy to the camp at Peterhoff. The whole lins was to be opened for the use of thepublicin thecourso ofthis month. The Emperor has recently signified his approbation of a new statute for appointing a Government inspector to all private lines of railroad. The chef of the Board of Works and Ways is to propose one of the engineerS connetedWwwith his office, and the Governmeit has the approval;,- the inspector so appointed has to watch over the regularity of the seivice, the comfort and the security of the passengers, the fulfilmentof all the legal obligations of th.e directors as regards the traffic; is entitled to demand explanations from the directors, and 'to have access to the books of the line;. to be present at the tgeaera rmeetings' of :the shaeholders, with the libezty of expressing his.opinionthere openly,whi&hhoe cinalo demaud ishall be entered on the minutes; in a word, his office is to wstchover the obxervance of all existing regulations, but without the power of ini- chef of thoWorks:ays7 r -Inhe.year i862?Ru,saia,wilh,aye.arved at.'t,he thomandtbh year- of:-it: existence &.az.parata ,Pow,er.

Letters from Sevi]le tell of the extreme dismiy caused in that city by the- recent unspariing execif-' tions. On the 1lth, on which day Caro and 2i others were shot, all the shops were ;' shut and the strzets deserted at an early hotar of the day. Most' of the Tictins -were' artisans, natives of Seville, where they had' numerous relatives. The execution took place at half-past ( p.m. As already nientioned, the criminals were drajwn up together and fired upon by a company. ' This was the plan pusued by. Cabrera during the civil 'war, in his wholesale massacres of Christino prisners. At Seville, according to one letter, the work was done but slovenly ; 'the soldiers must have fired too high, for, at the first discharge, Caro was the only one killed, although stray balls killed' two bystanders and wounded a third. At nightthere were numerous panics in the streets, people runnxrg in groundless terror; it was reported that all the members of the corporat;on had sent in their resignation; on the 12bh, newa having been circulated that, on the 13th 28 or 30 more were to be shot, deputations waited on the militaryr authorities, imploring'a reprieve until the deputies for the province should have communicated with the Madrid Government. After much solicitation the delay was granted. At Utrera, on the 12th, seven were shot, and four were sent on. the same night to Arahal, where they were to be shot-on the 14th, with eight others and two women.. To-day's Gacettepublishes theRoyalsandtion of the law reforming Articles 14 to 18 andr 28 of the Constitution, relating to the composition of tlie Senate. The hereditary senators are those grandees of Spain in their own right (that is to say, not by marriage, for in Spain marriage gives to the husband the rank and title of the wife) who can show that they have an income of 200,000 reals (2,0001.) derived from lands or houEes of their own, or from "xightsswhich enjoy the same legal consideratiqn."_ Spme o9Lthe newspapers say.that, on the occasion of the Quees's accuchiemnent the aristocracy will be aungmented by the creation of a number of new grandees, chiefly bankers and capitalists. Among those naimued for this honour are Messrs. Collado, Salamanca' Camiquini, Bayo, Rivas, &c. Tt is conjectured that most of them will entail estates upon their heirs, so as to transmit to them the hereditary senatorship. The Cazette also contains the following telegraphic despatch :- c" ROME, JLY 17. "His Holiness, benignly acceding to the entreaties of Spain, has granted his sanction to the sles of ecleslsstica. property made in t4e two anterior years, in the same terms as he did before in the Concordat.

This assemblage of the exilbd branch is saia to be connected with the projects of fusion so mWcOh talked about at `different times during the lsAt few misonths, but concerning which the most osite statements.have beenmnade, and othing jutivo -is known.

'..- . -The show of bort'horns is very great and of rare merit. In the class of bulls not exceeding four years old are tome very fine animals smong many which are In no way remarkable. Wr. Stirlings first-,rize bull is very handsome, and well worthy of the distinction he hts attained. In the class of young bulls'Colonel Towneley has been justly beaten by d. Fawkes, whose yearand-a-half -old roan bull takes the prize. Mr. her Hobbs's bull is exceedingly good, both as regards hissize, his level back deep frame, fine:head, and, good feeding quality. The bull-calve are not parMcularly note worthy. The oOWi in milk or in calf are extraor4inarily good. Mr. Stratton two cows have just that capacity of fra6e,. symmetry1 and beautiful quality always aso. much admired in this cls, but must fairly yield the palm'of superioritj to Colonel Towneley's first and secojid prize.cows, the former of which obtained the prize at Chelmsford last -year as a two-year-old, and the other received the Paris prize m the cow class. . The shorthorned heifers are coshmended as classes, but those of Mr.'Douglass,'Mr. Booth, and particularly the two yearlings of Colonel Towneley are worthy of special admiration. We should be sorry to reflect unwarrantably upon the adjudication of honours on this occasion, but we think the'judges have hardly exercised their best- perception in p referring Mr. I)onglasGs' heiufer. in Class 5 to Mr. tooth's, which gained the first prize at Chelmsford as a yearling. The Herefoirds far surpass in numer any previous show, and in character have never, perhaps) appeared in niore comely proportions and more beautifulquality. Mr. Willams, Mr. Turner, and Lord Bateman show some excellentanimalsinClass; and among the young bulls we most admired Mr. Price's year-and-a-bal£. old red and white Mr HIl's second prize bull, and that of Mr.' 'isher Hobbs, which has less of the sloping loin than many of the others. Lord Bateman's bull-calf is very extraordinarily developed for its age; that of his Royal Highness the Prince Consort is considerably Inferior to the prize calves in several points. The cows are uncommonly good, especially that of Mrs. Palmer, and, again, Lord Berwicles very fine and extraordinarily symmetrical, wonderfully handsome, and finely-fleshed animal. Mr. Hill's beautiful heifer takes the first prie in its class; and In the class of yearling heifers which is very properly commended, the Earl of Kladnors is a real beauty, exceedingly well formed, and having a beautiful .back and handsome head. Lord Berwicles was nearly equal in merit. - The Devons are much more numerous thah they have been forbiany years, and are extraordinarily good in almost all the' clasea The bulls not more than four years old c6nstltute a magnificent class. Both Mr. Davy's and Mr. Badley's prize animals are wonderful for size and proportions, straightness, symmetry, and handsome appearance. The yearling bull of Mr. Hase is beautiful, though small, and we should sa,y superior to that of Sir J. Buller, which has received -the first prize.' His Royal Highness exhibits two bull-calves and a cow,' one of the calves,a a very pretty little thing, taking a second prize, and the cow remarkable for her great breadth and deep fame, handsome head; ind fine bone. lMr. Quartly's calf is very good, and also his extraordinary' cow. . We most of all admired Mr.'Gibbs's magnificent cow suckling a very beautiful calf. Mr. Pope's heifers and Mr. Tumer's are espeially commendable, and we must not' omit to Imention with great praise Mr. Quartly'x prize yearling heifer. The Society have wisely offered prizes for the Channel Islands breeds ot cattle; aind the 15 specip aens-which were exhibited, although showinginge'neralawaintofsymmetiyinform,nevertheleAspossess fAr better fattening- characteristics than are commonly attributed to them, while the cows indicate by their large uddera ana swelling milk-veins their great value for'the dairy. I I Beyond the classes for the favourite breeds there are 'also others provided for any "' established breed ;" but every one must admnit that, excellent as ma;y be some of the animals h'ere shown, the most admirable specimens are-in the' old departments,and chiefly exhibited by our best krnown breeders. The show of horses quite exceeds oUr oxpectation. We were not prepared for such general excellence in all classes as we find. As far as numbers are concerned Chelmsfordias the advantage; we had there a total of 196, while at Salisbury we have bat 15L 'Oar. attention was drawn more especially to clas3es 1 2, 3, 4, and it becomes necessary to observe upon th.e udicious and most successful endeavours which the Suffolk menhave made to correct the deficiencies that we are generally prone to consider as appertain-| ing to their stock. *We must say that the Messra. Barthropp, Crisp, NVard, &c., deserve great praise for their unremitting exertions to improve and carry forward the stock of which ktr. Catlin with his Duke laid the foundation. They seem to be aware of the necesiity of seeking for mares of great size and substance in other counties, and are thus producing a superior strengthy class of horses for agricultural pursuits. This increase of bone and power was moat obvious in classes 2, 3, and 4, in all of which the Suffolk horses, save in one instance, carry off the prizes. Inour opinion, these are justthe horaes that are wanted in Wiltshire, and, indeed, in all our light land districts where active clever atepping is required, combined with considerable substance; and we have no doubt, arguing from the great doe mand for them now felt, and.the activity of breeders to supply that demand, that their presence will be I nearly cotemporary with their reputation. Sales were effected to-day among two-year-old stoclk horses at 3.001., 1501., and 2001., and among fillies of the same age at 701., 801., and 1001. Wiltshire takes but two of the prizes, in classes "for Agricultural Purposes" and the dray-horse class. This result agrees with the expectation we had formed from observations in the surrounding diatricts. The Dray Class did nob strike us as specially good. The show of mares and foals was very beautiful; we never saw better types of equine beauty. Mtessrs-. Wolton's and Wrinche's, who took respectively the first and second prizes, were wonderful anima.l. We were pleaed to find that several of those animals that had won distinction at Carlisle and Chelmsford here kept up their reputation, and responded to expectations formed of them. This was true of all except Mr. Parker's horse, who won such ribands as a two-years old at Carlisle; he has by no means developed well, though a valuable horse. The sheep show is undoubtedly the best the Society has yet gathered together, and isl more than double in number of entries that it was at Chelmsford. The Leicesters are not so well representea in MualiM4 as in number of animals. Mir. Pawlett and . ;andayoccupy their usual place of pre-eminence, and Mr. Spencer, Mr. Radmore, Mr. Turner, and Mr. CresBwell compete with very useful rams and also pens of handsome ewes from their well-known flocks. The Southdowns are a very large dass, and equal to their best appearance on any former occasion. M§r. Jonas Webb makes a clean sweep of all the honours-first prizes, second prizes, and most of the commendations; and in the class of rams more than one year old the animals obtaining the prizs are precisely those which were adjudged unworthy at Chelmsford. Mr. H. Overman takes both prizes in the class of shearling ewes for two pens of exceedingly beautiful animas: - Lord Walsingham, the Duke of Richmond, the Earl of Radnor, the Duke of Beaufort, and Massrs. Sainabury, MIills, Scott -:layward, Pope, Lucas, Farquharson, and Orme Foster showing thel'most adired and -valuable sheep.'- Thelongwoolleclasses wer never better, nearly the-whole show consisting of firstclass 'animals of wonderfully colossal proportion", of magniflcent 'formn, ad beauatiful quality, Mfessrs.
