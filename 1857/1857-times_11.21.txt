TRE CLASS LIST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The Examiners have again neglected to mark the names of tbose gentlemen to whom they have awarded an honorary fourth class in the examination just concluded. As an ordinary fourth class is generally considered the re. verse of a distinction, I think that it betrays a reprehensible carelessness on their part to confuse indiscriminately the ordinary and bonorary fourth clam maen when a stroke of the pen wvould have distinguished between them. The fourth class in the present listhis, I believe, in a great oblige aou honorary distinction. I know it to be so in the case of Sir H. Id. Beach, Oh. Oh.; lfr. G. Lavie, Oh. Oh; * r. S. M'Caul, St. John's; and Mr. S. Patrick, Queen's. Perhaps one of the Ex;aminers can furnish the names which I1 havo omltted. By the insertion of this you wrill greatly oblige your obedient servant.

RE EVANS AND HOABE'S BAN1RUPrOy. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-There is an error in your report of this case in The 2rm-s of this date, which we aro desirous should be oDrrected. Mr. Gassiot is thore reported as having wished to make a statement relative to the transactions of the bankrnpts, Evans and Hoare, with Messrs. Hoare and Co, the brewers. Mr. Gassiot is one of the trade assiuees of this estate, and had not any wish or intention of doing so Mr. Sleigh, the conisel, instructed by us princip;lly for the purpose of examining Mr. Woodbr dge (not Goodrich, as named by you), stated to the Court that one of the asFignees could, mnuch better than himself, explain some transactions relating to the manner in which the books of the bankrupts bad been kept, and which might probably influence the decision of the Commissioner as to their passlng their last examination. On this the Commissioner made DO observation. Subsequently some discussion took place between the counsel and solicitors who appeared for the bankrupts, and when Mr. Gassiot rose the Commissioner immediately desired him to sit down, as he could not bef heard. We are, your obedient servants. Solicitors to the Assignees. Nov. 20.
TME Disnornic oF ST. Avnu's.-In Connexiort vwith the proposed episcopal changes the Government Bi to be introduced next sesson will probably provide for the erection of a new hisbopric, of which St. Alban's will be the seat, and from which the new bishop, whoever he may be, will tako his title. The gee wiU be endowed out of the funds which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have in hand, arising out of the recent faling in of episcopal and capitular estates; while 10,000. have been subseribed tovwards the restoration of St. Alban's Abbey, on condition that It be made a cathedral, as recommended by Archbishop Cranmer to Heenry VII. The new dioceos will be formed out of the preEent sees of London and Rochester, and will include the important towns of St. Alban's, lomn ford, Rloyston, Honnslow, Brentford, Ulxbridge, Berkbamp. stead, RiekmunRswortb, Welwvn, Hlitchin, Bishop's Stoi. ford, Ware. Rennel Bempatead, Hertford, and tlhe adjacent parishes. The new blohop will be subject to the arrangernen entered into with Parliament on the erection of the see ot Manchester-namely, that there shall be no acoesionto the rnmber of bi8bops in the House of Lords; so thatwhen thb aiocess of St. Mhan's is created there wiU always be twcv bisbops who will not have seats in arliUaent-Afhncsfcr i Examintr.
MONEARKAY-fBBTandCI?rINTJJL L gNGvE. Friday Evening. The Bank returns to-night show a reduction in the bullion of 686,4l21., aud an infringement of the Aet of 1844 to the extent of 2,000,0001. While we Lave been increasing ourpromisesto pay ingold, tha a0ock of gold On which thoae promises are based have :Wen steadily diainishing. Al wiU see that this inverse process must have certain litnits, and that If those limits were reached national suspension would be the result. The genius of the advocates for a "relaxing power" would then have to be tested in all its force, and it will be the business of these persons in the approaching discussion to show how in such cases it would be exereised. Happily, the danger may hlow be regarded as checked by the partial tendency to a revival of confidence and the large total of Australian gold about to be delivered. It iil be well, therefore, that the public, as they can do so without alarm, should recognize the contingencies that have been before them, and derive as much profit as they can from the lesson. The chances from the first were that we should sa spe, but is the possibility of national discredit ever again to be left to chance? Supposing the Scotch and Irish run for ipecie had not abated; supposing not merely that they had continued, but that the contagion of them had spread to Eugland; supposing, instead of the fall of Delhi, we had had the news of a repulse; or supposing, even apart from any of these circumstances, that the urgent desire of some monetary philanthropbsts had been cszvled out, that we should send at any coat of British suffering a loan of 10,000,0001. to Calcutta to prevent the natives being temporarily inconvenienced by any impediment to their syster of hoardinv,-where should we have been at this moment? lUnqueatlonably we sbould aleady have suspended specie pay. raents. Moreover, if a relaxing power had existed apart from the necessity of obtaining a Parliamnentary indemnity, there can be little doubt we i31ould not have escaped that result even under existing circumstances. Instead of the getting up of the panic having been delayed till the rate of discount had reached 10 per cent., the whole force exerted for that object would have been brought to bear upon the Minister as soon as it had attained 8 per cent. The precedent of 1847 would have been quoted as irresistible. The request would possibly have been granted, and, as subsequent experience has shown, the foreign draln would have gone on. Headlong alarm would have set in, and the end would have been witnessed probably some weeks before the present date. These are the practical evidences of the hour, and when Parliament meets it will be impossible for them to be evaded. That the Goverament had little choice but to yield to the pressure last week every one will admit. The quiestion is whhether all classes cannot be made to understand for the future that our currency system will be preserved in its integrity, and that henceforth, instead of relying upon concessions, they must be prepared for its strict enforcemeat. The funds have been very steady to-day, and have closed at an advance of a quarter per cent. The confirmation of the statement made yesterday, that the advance required upon ample securities by an important Amerlcan house would be fully granted, the absence of further serious failures during the day (the only suspension mentioned being that of a firm of whose ultimate solvency there is apparently not the slightest doubt), a further improvement in the foreign exchanges, and the prospect of about half a mnillion of Australian gold being forthwith taken to the Bank, and also of a considerable arrival by the Persia from New York, all assisted in imparting firmness. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 89g to i, rere first quoted 89j to £. From this they went to 890 to 90, and the final prices were 891 for money and 90~ to i for the 7th of December. Early in the dayloans on Government Securities were in demand at 10 per cent., but ultimately there was a better suipply. Bank Stock closed at 212 to 214; Reduced, 89O to i; New Three per Cents., 89g to J ; India Stock, 212 to 215; India Bonds, 45s. to 35s. discount; andExchequer-bills, 14s. to lls. discount. The transactions in foreign stocks have been rather numerous, and the market generally shows greater firmness. Turkish closed at a slight advance; Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 9ti; Chilian Six per Cents., 100i; Mexican, for the account, 18k; Russian Five per Cents., 104*; ditto, Four-anda-Half per Cents., 94i, 95;, and A ; Sirdinian, for the account, 88k; Spanish, for the account, 40j; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25O ; Turkish Six per Cents., 871 ; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 97Q and i; 'Belgian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 94i; Dutch Two-and-a-H1alf per Cents., 64i; and the Four per Cent. Certiiicates, 9,7. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Amsterdam and Hamburg wvere rather higher, but Paris was about the same as last post. In the corn-market this morninig there was a slight increase of business, but no recovery in prices. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a further decline of id. to Id. per lb. in American descriptions. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 6Gf. 80c. for money and 66f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. At Vienna there has been a partial recovery, and {he premium on gold has declined nearly one per cent. The rate of discount at Hamburg has again ad-vanced from 81 to 9* per cent. This has partly been 'occasioned by the apprehension of a large failure, which it is believed, however, will be found to have been averted. About 35,0001. of bar gold and gold coin was sold to the Bank to-day. The suspension was annowunced to-day of Messrs. J. R. Thomson and Co., a firm largely engaged in the colonial trade, and especially with the Cape of Oood Hope. Their liabilities are supposed to Zmount to about 200,0001. or 300,0001., but they have abundant assets at the Cape and Mauritius. Indeed, there seems to be a conviction that within six months a surplus of 200,0001. can be realized. Meanwhile some of the bills drawn upon them wil go back to houses able to meet them, but who have neglected duly to remit. The house has establishanents at the Cape and Algoa Bay, but these will not be compromised. Another rather large suspension was reported in The course of the morning, but the diffioulty proved merely to have been temporary or accidentaL The produce-markets, which at the commencement of the week showed a slight tendency to im- provement, have since relapsed, in consequence of -the extreme pressure for money and the still uatisfactory nature of the American advices. The further heavy failures during all the early days of ihe week, also increased the general feeling of dcisirus, but the absence of any fresh difficulties y'esterday and to-day has had some effect in re'storing confidence. The demand for sugar was More active at the opening of the market, and an advance of 3X. to 4s. upon the recent lowest rates was established, the xtrong refining and good grocery kinds meeting with buyers to a moderate extent. Euhbequently a reawtion again ensued, owing partly to coniderable quantity being declared fore publlo Oak to-day, when the latest quotations were I. to 2X undet thoe omTrmt on Tuesday. The kdvloeu from Havannah are favourable as regards the crop, and there is nbo diminution in the receipts from the United States. The Dutch Trading Company's sa!e of Java, helidyesterday,comprisedonly12,000 baskets, whieh went above the valuations, although six to seven guilders under the rates of the last sale. The small public sales of plantation coffee held this week I have gone oft at a further reduction of Is. to 2s. Other -kinds are nearly neglected. Business in rice has been confined to a few parcels for cash at the late lov prices. The tea-market continues muoh depressed, but the transactions have been so limited as fcarcely to alow of a quotation. Some parcels of cassia lignea importd from New York went nearly 50s. per owt. under the rates paid in the early part of this month. Other kinds of spice have been inactive. The sales in saltpetre have been limited to a few parcels of fine Bengal at 2s. to -is. per cowt. below the previous quotations. The supplies at Calcutta had accumulated to a greater extent than had been anticipated, and this market is still completely unsettled. The Ottoman Bank have received to-day a further sum of 1.4,3001. in gold from the East. It is understood that the laying of the proposed submarine cable of the eediterranean Extension Company between Malta and Corfu, a distance of about 300 miles, will be commenced to-morrow. The following letter recaUs attention to an imnportant means of opening up financial resources in India, recently urged by another correspondent:- " Sir,-As Parliament is summoned to meet at an early date, wrhen questions of vast importance afeoting our monetary system, and also affecting the relations of this country towards India, will bo raised, it is most important that our reprosentatives should not rush into any hasty legislation as respects the one or the other of these great questions. " There is no reason why, however, we should not deal wIth minor questions arisiug out of theor, Thus, the Government will, no doubt, bring in a Bil to legalize its Act authorizing an extended issue of notes on the part of the Bank of England, and we may find some plans proposed for aiding the Indlan Government as respects its financial requirements. " Now, at a time when we are at home suffering from a scarcity of money and from the effects of a serious panio, the public have a right to expect that the resources of this country he not further taxed, if it can be shown that there are sources in Inadia whence abundant means can be raised, not only to defray the oost of suppressing the existlng mutiny, but also to provide for the developement of the in. ternal resources of thab empire in a manner never yet done. "I allude to a settlement of the land tenures and the establishment of a freehold interest. It is true that time will be required to oarry oct throughout our Indlau empire the former, and thereby to develope, on a large scale, its internal resources. But to meet the present financial diffioulty I ventare to alfirm that the Indian Government has within Its own power the means of raising a saffiolent amount. Let the Government ardal itselt of that resource vwhioh the settlement of the land tenures by Lord Cornwallis in Bengal, known has the Zemindary settlemnent has plaed at its command. Let the Government offer to commute the annual payment of rent into a prinoipal sum, and create a freehold interest in the property. " I am persuaded numbers of the wealthy classes in India would avail themselves of suoh an offer and place the Governrent In the possession of fands adequate for ita present wants. "I am, &c., "'B. B." The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 18th of November gives the follow. iDg results when compared with the previous week - Public Deposits ... £5,483,881 ... Increase £169,222 OtherDeposits 1 13,959,165 ... Increase 1,023,821 Rest ... ... ... 3,433,500 ... Incroase 69,141 On the other sido of the account:- Governmeab Securities £6,407,134 ... Decrease 3,037,694 Other Securities ... 30,299,270 ... Increase 4,185,817 Notes unemployed ... 1,148,185 ... Increase 190,475 The amount of notesin circulation is 21,406,4107., boing an increase of 1,223,0551.; and the stock of bullion in both departments is 6,484,0961., showing a decrease of 686,4121. when compared with the preceding return. The return in the Gazette, after stating that the amount of notes imsued is 22,554,5951., mentions in a note that 2,000,0001. have been issued under the authority of the lotter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and makes up the other side of the account to the above total by a corresponding increase in the amount of other securities, putting them down at 5,459,9001., instead of 3,459,9001. as heretofore. The return from the banking department shows the nature of this change, for the Government securities are there put down as 6,407,1341, showing a decrease of 3,037,6941. The Bank have therefore transferred 2,000,0001. of Government securities from the banking to the issue department, and disposed of about 1,000,0001. more of them by sales in the market. This diminution of the Government securities in the banking department will account for three out of the four millions increase in the amount of bills discounted, and the balance is made up by the increase of about one niillion in the private deposits on the other side of the account.

Caledonian, however, advanced i per cent., and North-Eastern Stocks continue exceptionally firm.

SYTATE OP TBADE. MANCHESTER, Nov. 20. The slight improvement reported on Tuesday, in consequence of orders brought by the Indian mall, was still perceptible on Wednesday, but, as on the former day, no salutary effect was produced on prices, the competition among seUers for the little business offering enabling buyers to operate at the very lowest rates of the preylous week for cloth, and to stiul greater advantage (fd. to id. per lb. decline) in yarns. Since Wednesday the market has relapsed into the unrelieved dulness 'which characterized It previously. The attempt to get up values at Liverpool for cotton in the early part of the weel;, when prices advanced Id. per lb., has proved abortive, the entire advaneo having since been lost; and the resulp of this attempt Is probably reacting on the market for flrni and cloths, by inducing buyers to withhold what few orders they h ve, in the hope of stiUl lower rates. The new failures announced every day, however, have also considerable effect in retarding business, and, even it the 10 per cent. charged upon converting biUs into money were to exist no longer as an obstacle, would operate to indueo the utmost caution among all classes of traders before increasing their responibilities. Great relief, however, has been felt here that tho assistauce sought by three of the leading houses in the country (the names of which are well knovrn here) has been given by the Bank of England. The only failure announced here this week is that of Mr. Leopold Sampson, in ho African trade, with liabilities to the amount of between 60,0001. mnd 70,0C00. The great depresion of trade In this distot is shown by the fact that one of our local railways has found It necessary to reduce the mileage of its tr%ias by more than 600 miles per day.

THE ORGAi NUISANCE. TO TME EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -Once upon a time somoe medical students, desirous of pursuing their studies in peace, took np their abode in what they innocently deemed one of the quietest streets in Edinburgh. But their studious repose vvas direfilly interrupted by those fearful sounds to which you lately so touchingly alluded. Au Italian boy with a monkey and hurdy-gurdy first startled their ears with dismal discords. An agonized student rushed forth, and, with fatal rashness, gave bins sixpence as an encouragement to depart. As might be anticipated from this insane act boy, monkey, and hnrdygurdy returned next morning vvith redoubled grindiDgs, and wese succeeded at brlef internals by fiddlers, ldlt-olad pibroch players, flat-nosed German torturers, and all the barrel organists and showmen that Anld B2eekle could produce. Like true Britons, the medical students called a meeting to devise a remedy for this fearful calamity-they appointed a chairman, secretary, and committee, and raised funds. But how were these funds to be made available to hush the discord and restore the harmony of silenoe? Assuredly not by bribing the enemy to go away-they were not quite SO verdant. Nor did they anticipate sueh pleasing freshness in the musicians. But an embryo Havelock stood forth and thus arranged a campaign:-" Let every stndent supply the lttle boys of the house wherein ho lodges with a tin pan and an iron spoon- w hen a musician or nolsemaker of any sort appears let them at once surround bims, and on their successfnuly driving him by their superior noise from. the street let them be rewarded liberally by the committee. This counsel ws at once received and acted on, and the result was perfeztly successful in banishing the foe. Iou OUODeck%eti., S6r-2t, E. A. R. S.
A YovJrG &IDr's AnVIE .}The following incident is related by a correepondent of the dChcnhaJk Bxaminer of Wedneeday :-" On a oold, thiok foggy day last 'week my bailiff and a ne Ihbour, walking home from market on the old tiunpike road overtook a ladylike, well-dremed yomng woman, qu{te alone, silently travelling the ame way. They passed on, but observed that the forlorn one kept a few paces behind them. They contlnued for about two miles walking on, but without speaking to the stranger. At length the neighbour came to his residonce and left his friend, who walked on towards the farm. It appeared extraordinary to see a young lady sot a miles from a town, on a lonely road, In a dense fog, at 7 o'clock in the evening in November; and out of iindness he asked her where she was going. The poor thing answered, II do not know. ' Why, where did you come from r IOh, from -.' ' Wat, so far off as that ' ' Yes, I havo boen walking all day, and have bad nothing to eat. Oh, Iam very unhappy!' At this time they had arrived at my lodge; the bailiff, feeling the impropriety of leaing A beautiful and ladylike young creature In her exposed condition, and knowing there was a spare bed there, called to the housekeeper and explained the ease, when the good Samaritea at once took the wandererin, made tea forher, prepared her a bed, and treated ber jl-e her own child. It soonr became known in the house, and other supervision was instituted, and an arrangement made that In the mnorning two poor liut respectable women should accompany the yoang lady to her home, a distance of 12 or 14 miles. They did so, and on arriving at the mansion of the Young lady'S parents, after a four hours' walk, a piece of dry bread and choee and Is. to each womian was sent from the drawing-room. Thecoachman had been riding about all niglt in different directions in search of the young lady the footman had. been all over the village, the whole ndglhbourhood unemy and anxious, aud the restoration of the lost sheen was valued at2., asa reward for two poor women waukin nearly A D miles, and In the meet affectionate mAnner talkg caro of an interesting fellowcreature, who dight, but for that very kdndness, hae been lost to her family for ever."

LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVrMBER 21, 1857, The recent successes of our Generals in India will produce a material alteration in the position of our forces, and a considerable change in the scenes to which for some months past the eyes of the public have been directed. Of Delhi we shal probably hear little more than details of the great exploit by which it was recaptured, for the anarchy consequent upon military occupation and the destruction incidental to the siege appear to have reduced the city to desolation and ruin. Lucknow will still be a centre of interest, for the European garrison, though rescued from the extremity of peril, is yet in the midst of enemies, and the chief work indeed attending the pacification of Hindostan wil probably have to be performed in Oude. But in the main the operations of our troops will present a new aspect, and it may prove of some service to our readers if, in anticipation of the expected intelligence, we briefly delineate the state of affairs as they existed at the beginning of last monthL; Calcutta itself has for some time been placed beyond reach of danger, and the security of the capital is at last guaranteed by the presence of a naval squadron, the broadsides of which could lay it in ruins-an additional proof of the co-operation which could have been lent by our navy at an earlier period. With the exception, moreover, of some troublesin Assam there were no disturbances apprehended in the Eastern Proviices of the Empire. Even Pegu, our most recent acquisition, though actually left with only 500 European troops, has been preserved by General BELL in perfect tranquillity. The Burmese authorities have evinced no desire to take advantage of our embarrassments, and, as the Province was garrisoned from the Madras establishment, the Sepoys were saved from the contagion which infected the whole army of Bengal. Proceeding westward from Calcutta, it is not until we arrive at the frontier of Bahar that we meet with any points of probable importance. There the half-suppressed mutiny of the Dinapore garrison has left its traces, and, though the mutineers themselves have evacuated the district, small bodies of our troops are still in motion to control the disaffected, and keep open the communication with Allahabad by the Great Trunk Road. At Allahabad the scene begins to acquire interest, for it is from tnis city that the reinforcements from the Lower Provinces, that is to say, the great body of troops arriving from England, will commence their advance against the revolters, after having availed themselves of the navigation of the Ganges in their route from Calcutta. Up to the latest accounts the only regiments not originally pertaining to the Indian establishments which had passed this point were the 5th Fusileers from the Mauritius, and the 90th from the China Expedition, but the 93d Highlanders were on their way, and Captain PEi's Naval Brigade had got up the river as far as Mirzapore, from which city to Allahabad the distance is but 61 miles. Two other regiments moreover, the 23d and 82d, had disembarked at Calcutta, and woald probably follow immediately in the same route, so that the force which Sir JAirns OTRrtA& represented as necessary for the occupation of Lucknow and the safe removal of the garrison might possibly be at Allahabad before the end of last month. It is not unlikely that Cawnpore may be made in some respects a base of operations in these parts, for the point would be about eqlLidistant from the districts of Rohilcund to the North-west and those of Bundelcund to the South-east, in both of'which dtrong bodies of insurgents are at large, If General OruTnA retired from Lucknow after relieving the garrison, it was probably at Cawnpore that he halted, and from this city he could advance again, after receiving succours,over the scenes of his former victories. But Lucknow would not be the only point requiring observation. At Banda, little more than 70 miles to the South of Cawnpore, the mutineers of Dinapore had stationred themselves, and it appears, indeed, as if the remaining forces of the revolt were gravitating for the most part towards these districts. The survivors of the Delbi garrison, divided, it is taid, into two campact bodies, marched undoubtedly in both cases towards the East, though whether they succeeded in eludlng or defying our pursuing columns, and in reaching Agra or its vicinity, is more than we can yet tell. Within 30 miles or so of Agra, at the fort of Dholpore, were the rebels of the Indore Contingent; and at Gwalior, about 35 miles further to the South, ScIN DIA's Contingent had been but recently dispersed, and could still, perhaps, supply some aid to their comrades. There are few things, indeed, more remarkable in the whole of this wonderful story than the peculiarity of the organization retained by the mutineers. Though the insmrrection possesses no elements of general unity, tbough the rebels cannot form an army or operate comprehensively in the field, they seem to preserve with incredible tenacity the shape into which we had moulded them. At the principal nilitary stations in Hindostan the Sepoys were usually grouped together in brigades of three battalions each, and these brigades, though not combining very freely with one another, have actually survived in themselves the shocks of six months' unsuccessful insurrection. The Dinapore Brigade, though it lost nearly a fourth of its numbers in getting away from its cantonments, and was afterwards roughly handled at Arrah by Major ViNcENT EYRE, has Btruggled over more than 300 miles of country, and is still unbroken at Banda. The Neemuch Brigade, the Nusseerabad Brigade, and the Bareilly Brigade, representing respectively the traitorous garrisons of those threestations, were al merged for months in the rebel force at Delhi, but so completely did they retain their individuality, that after the capture of the city they decamped each by itself, and with their internal organization unimpaired. The Bengal army has been shattered into fragments, but these fragments, like masses of masonry from a ruined tower, show by their strength and cohesion the excellence of the original work. Somewhere or other in the country between Banda, Gwalior, and Cawnpore, it seems to be presumed that the execrable miscreant TNASA SAMB is still exerting his diabolical energies against us. His intrigues were said to be traceable at Gwalior and in Oude, nor is there anything improbable in the supposition that some of the rebel bodies now roaming about the country may draw to a head under his command. On our own side there will be two forces in the field of considerable strength, one under OurnAM, continually reinforced from Allahabad, and operating probably from Cawnpore, and another under theGeneralorGenerals despatched with flying columnsfromthearmyat Delhi. To these, also, we may add a division nearly 3,000 strong, which has been advancing northwards from :Kamp. tee, in the Madras Presidency, and whlich had already reached Jubbulpore in time to do good service against the mutineers of that garrison. We observed a week or two ago that disturbances of a troublesome nature were to be apprehended at various stations of the large province of Rajpootana, and the likelihood of these contingencies seems to have been rather increased than diminished since that time. These territories, however, do not represent a vital-scarcely, indeed, a vulnerable-point of our empire, and precautions have been taken to circumscribe the mischief. VkN CORTLA?NDT, an officer of great merit, is actively employed in the district of Hurrianah, with Ids head-quarters at Hansi, and a column coming upwards from Mhow will be supported by troops which the Bombay authorities have pushed forward. IJp to the date, indeed, of the last mail Bombay had received almost as many reinforcements as Calcutta. the 4th and 33d having arrived from the Mauritius and the 89th and 95th from the Cape. Some misgivings were expressed in the Late despatches respecting the continuance of tranquillity ou our North-Western frontiers, in Scinde and the Punjab; but General JAcOB had returned to his post in the former province, and, with EDWARDES and COTTON at Peshawur, it was reasonable to entertain an unshaken confidence in the maintenance of our ascendancy, notwithstanding any aggressions on the part of the Affghan tribes. It is somewhat remarkable, indeed, that neighbours always so troublesome, and demanding even in the most pacific times all the vigilance and activity of our border garrisons, should have been kept so quiet through this season of trouble. If there is room for doubt at all respecting the tranquillity of these parts, it must arise from the extent to which the military strength of the Government has been reduced by the succours so generously despatched to Delhi, and not from any distrust in the power of Sir Joux LwnXCE, whose extraordinary abilities have not only preserved the Punjab but enabled us to crush the mutiny itself in its stronghold. It is hardly possible, indeed, to look to these parts of India without a feeling of security and reliance, nor can we affect to feel any apprehension when such men are in command. The next MIail, we hope, may bring us good warrant for confidence in all directions together, and in the meantime we at home ought to be testifying a becoming gratitude for the services so nobly rendered by LAwnXcz, HAvBzocA WILaso; Cx I 0n3araAN, and their comrades.
The conversation of some persons is a perpetual speechifying. Sir RoBERT PRFris speeches, vice versd, are conversations. Nothing can be more light, free, and airy than his public remarks upon public men and public events. We have nothing particular to say against them it they were delivered in their proper place-at a dinner table, or to two or three friends at a club with whomhe was on the easiest terms. HIis speeches are pleasant reading enough; he touches lightly upon a succession of subjects, his step is elastic, ana he iis not sleepy, or ponderous, or commonplace. We believe his speeches are read more than others which deserve more attention. Many excellent and conscientious public men, inspired with a sense of duty to their constituents, get up materials for a ponderous lecture upon education, upon science, upon sanitary improve. ment, the history of the art of printing, the English constitution, and other important subjects, for which they are thanked in due form by the Mayor or principal borough magistrate present. Sir PLOBErT PmEu has hit off with much less trouble, perhaps, quite as agreeable a result. His secret for interesting the public is to give them a section of a conversation at his own table, to tbrow form to the winds, and talk just as he would at a small party under the exhilarating Influence of a day's successful sport. It is not easy to explain at first the adoption of such a singular style of public speech. Is it nervousness? We know that this cause sometimes prodauces effects apparently the most opposite to itself, that it produces the very extreme of self-possession. Are you astounded at some extraordinary defiance of rooial rules, some liberty; that no mortal man, as you thought, dare venture on, you are ire to hear that the offender is a remarkably shy man. Is Sir ROERnT PEI a shy man, or does he suffer from a dread and horror of being prosy ? This is some people's nightmare-a rare one, we are sorry to say-very rare; would that it were more prevalent; stiUl it is the characteristic nightmare of a select few ; they are so desperately afraid of being dull, or didatic, or addicted to sermonizing, that they can hardly reconcile themselves to one .moment's deceut seriousness on any one subject. This is a pity. We admire misplaced solemnity as little as any one, and yet we must give it as our opinion, at the risk of being reflected on as prosy, that there are subjects on which, and occasions at which, seriousness is required and levity is unbecoming. Sir RoBnRT PE's style of public speech is, perhaps, the result of an early imbibed horror and antipathy of this kind, -which urges him to fly from the slightest approach to seriousness as if it were infected and poisonous, an atmosphere charged with all the evils of humanity -plagues, cholera, simooms, droughts, blights, and famines. Whatever the world says of him, Sir R. PnrL is determined that it shall not say he is prosy, or that he is in any way, direct or indirect, addicted to preaching, or to attempting to make hiraself useful, or struggling to be weighty. The DIoEIsES of Tamworth is cast in a different mould from Lord STrA=NY and the useful men; he does not apparently think it worth his while troubling himself very much about human affairs ; he inherits a good name, a good fortune, the best of country seats, and many other social enjoyments and advantages -why should he vex himself about the course of human events or encumaber himnself with political tasks and duties? He can be happy in his " tub," which is, all things considered, a tolerably comfortable one. Sir ROBXBT PZza's offhand style of public speech may be the indirect reflection of this school of sentiment in his mind, or it may be, as we have just conjectured, a happy discovery, a new invention for interesting the public. The great mass of his auditors consists, of course, of a class much below hirnself in station, and they like to know what their betters talk of, and how they talk, when they are among themselves. It is a little opening into the great world, gratifying to a harmless curiosity. So Sir ROBEBT PREL goes to the Town-hall at Tamworth and talks for the amusement of the company exactly as he would talk to two or three chatty friends in a room. He gives them a section of Olympian conversation. Whether the specimen will raise the public impression of the celestial circle is perhaps a questionperhaps the eastern policy is the more sagacious, which takes full advantage of the truth that " dis" tance lends enchantment to the view." The illusion is often spoilt by a look behind the scenes, and men who have penetrated beyond the wall of mystery which keeps one of our worlds from another find that the contact with reality has dispelled much of the charm which attached to the unknown. The most prominent feature of this very free and easy speech is a series of personal remarks upon our principal public men. Sir R. Pzi's mind is not cast in a reverential mould, aud it is clear that he has not much respect for anybody. The remarks on Lord PAlM?ERSTON are the single exception to a running strain of light and entertaining cynicism, and even he hardly escapes. Lord PAMEsroN makes "injudicious observations," and curious observations," though he also makes " agreeable speeches," and has " an agreeable way "of dealing with affairs." Lord PALKEssroS "was "in a capital humour" at the Mansion-house dinner, and "said that Lord CAINNING was a "great man ;" and "he was quite right in say"ing so," though it was pre-eminently and conspicuously not the fact, because a man ought " to " stick by his friends ;" because " if a man sticks "to his friends his friends will stick to him ;" and therefore " Lord PAiMERSTON sticks by his " friends," and he is quite right to do so. Sir ROBxET PEEI then goes on to say how he, for his part, likes Lord PAracnsToN, and what a vigorous old fellow he thinks him; and that he himself intends to stand by Lord PAEN=STON, in whose cause he at last warms, rises to an oratorical flight, and mounts up to a climax, amid the cheers and acclamations of his audience. From the PRErIER the speaker goes to Lord GRANVILLE, whose observations about Lord CANz2muN "fell as " flat as ditchlwater ;" from Lord GRAVNVILE to Lord CANNRIG himself, " who had been Postmaster"General, and rni1ht be a great man ," from Lord CANif\NG to the Duke of CAsBRIDGE, " who had " not yet earned his baton, though he had made " a sensible speech ;" and from the Duke of CssrBRIDGE to ourselves, whom he charges with having amserted " Lord Jonx RUSSELL to be the "only man who wantedReform," whereas he thinks nmany more want it." We beg to say that we never made this assertion, though at the same time we do not see any great ardour in the country on the subject, ard question whether Sir RoBERT P.EZL hitmself cares much about it. Indeed, it would be difficult to say for what person or thing Sir R. Pim does particularly care, difficult to say whom he respects, what cause he is anxious for, or what side he takes. Everybody and everything appear pretty much the same to him, with the single exception of Lord PAL-MERSTON, who has made an impression, and whom he allows to be somebody. The PRZMIIER ought to be proud of the conquest of so fastidious a critic, who praises nobody elfse, and to payhim in return the compliment of saying that his admirer is a sharp fellow enough, and, for a cynic, not an ill-natured man.
The great problem furnished by the Danubian Principalities is at last approaching a solution; but the result is much less remarkable than the process by which it will have been attained. In former times it was said that war was the pastime of kdngs. The modern rulers of the world are happily accustomed to content themselves with the more innocent amusement of diplomacy. It is generally evident to bystanders that the business in hand might be accomplished by methods comparatively intelligible and direct; but Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors are bound by the rules of the game, and a very singular game it is. One of its maost puzzling peculiarities consists in the frequent change of partners. It is necessary that the great Powers should at all times be divided into two opposing factions, but the composition of either party is subject to incessant modification. The irresistible union of the Western Powers suddenly gives place to a coalition of France with Rusda, while England, even if threatened for a moment with isolation, soon finds herself in active eo-operation with Austria. With all the players the. stakes form but a secondaroy consideration. The object is to possess, or rather to exhibit, European influence, and especially to triumph in the Ministerial intrigues which are constantly proceeding at Constantinople, It is a happy circumstance that, after a sufficient display of skill and energy, the contest is almost always terminated by some compromise which might have been devised without difficulty at the commencement. After two years of negotiation the Five Powers have recently discovered that they are all agreed to indulge Wallachia and Moldavia with a merely administrative Union. The difficulty, far more interesting to diplomatists, of M. PA THORrV£NL'S ,Uiarrel with RDES9UL P~A$" is to be patched up aimuitaneously. The French Ambassador consents to recognize the existence of the Grand, Vizier, and Pera wiU enjoy the agree. able excitement of speculating on the next pretext for a dispute among the Foreign Ministers. The extreme eagerness of all the continental Governments to hurry on the peace was the occasion of all the subsequent discussion. As the sovereignty of the PoRTE over the Principalities had formned the immediate issue to be decided by the war, it was impossible to dispense with provisions for their future condition. The Great Powers, succeeding to the protectorate formerly exercised by Russia, were bound to take care that the feudal supremacy of Turkey should be exercised with a due regard to the ancient rights of the Provinces. It was the duty of the Plenipotentiaries to agree upon the necessary securities, and it would have been easy to refer the details of the arrangement to some competent commission. Unluckily, the instinct of diplomatic jealousy was already at work. Some of the Powers wished to confine their interference -within the narrowest limits; others thought that interast or ambition recommended the establishment of a new State in the East of Europe; but at the same time the great majority desired the immediate conclasion of the treaty. Agreement could only be produced by the postponement of all subjects of dissension, and a pretext for adjournient was provided by the curious device of consulting the inhabitants of the Principalities as to their future destiny. The decree of the Congress may probably have been received in good faith by the people of Wallachia and Moldavia; but no statesman or political observer ever seriously thought that the Divans would be allowed to determine the policy of Europe. The unanimity with which all the despotic Governrents appealed to popular suffrage was in itself not a little suspicious; but the zeal which was subsequently displayed for purity of election was still more surprising. Any allusion which might have prevailed as to the deference of the Congress to the wishes of the population was speedily dispelled. The Ambassadors at Constantinople made no secret of their determination to infuence the Divans for the promotion of the lines of policy which they had respectively adopted. When the Eaimakan of Moldavia had, by methods sufficiently questionable, secured thle return of an anti-Unionist majority, Lord STRATFORD and the Austrian InterDunciO maintained the validity of the elections, while the representatives of France, of Russia, of Prussia, and of Sardinia suspended relations with the Ottoman Government. The temporary triumph of English influence was followed by the concessions of Osborne, and the Kaimakan VOGORIDES, concluding that the French star was in the ascendant, once more packed the Divan, but on this oceasion with the partisans of the Union. Wallachia had been already secured to the party supported by France and Russia; and the Principalities have accordingly declared themselves, by their recognized organs, desirous of forming a single political community under a foreign Prince. Having thus disposed of the question which they were required to answer, the assemblies have, not unnaturally, occupied themselves with other provisions to be included in their future constitution. The members may probably have thought that in carrying out the policy of France and of her supporters they have secured to themselves patrons able and willing to guarantee their independence in regulating their own internal administration. Turkey and Austria have from the first consistently protested against the establishment of a second Greece to the north of the Danube. Eagland, with little immtediate interest in the matter, has discountenanced the dismemberment of the Ottoman dominions. At the last momentFrance and Russia have, we are told, by some unexplained process, arrived at a similar conclusion. The assemblies which were so laboriously brought together have enjoyed the merit and good fortune of supporting the policy which was favoured by the majority of the Ambassadors at Constantinople. They will now be made to understand that important political arrangements are ia all cases controUed by the Great Powers. The reasons for consulting the population through its genuine or ostensible representatives form a part of those inscrutable mysteries which are peculiar to diplomacy. In official language, the question of the Principalities is reserved for the Congress of Paris. In the spring of 1856 the Plenipotentiaries were unable to conclude an arrangement, because they were ignorant of the wishes of the inhabitants. Their successors of 1858, in full possession of the information which was then unattainable, will deliberately disregard the declaration of the Divans. If it is suggested that the same conclusion might have been formed at the commencement of the discussion, it may be replied that the controversy has provided the different Courts with much healthy excitement. A bag fox or a tame deer is intended to give good sport, and only the ignorant will suggest that the fox might have been given to the hounds at starting, or that the deer might have been kept in the cart. Almost every Government concerned has enjoyed some triumph during the contest. Lord STRATFORD induced the PorTE to refuse the demand for a fresh election. M. D1 THOUVNFL and his colleagues ultimately carried their point, and drove the Turkish Minister from office. But on the very day selected by the French Ambassador for an entertainment to the new Vizier the SULTAN visited REDsc=D in state, and it was evident that English influence was once more predominant. Austria may set off the slight which has been offered to the Divans against their objectionable vote for the union of the Provinces. Russia has had the satisfaction of displaying a disinterested magnanimity, while her battle was generously fought by France. WVith so many considerations to satisfy the selflove of all parties, it may be hoped that the members of the Congress will meet with the most amicable disposition to one another, and with a desire to compensate the people of the Principalities for their recent disappointment. Wallachia and Moldavia, though they are not to form a kingdom, may be orderly and prosperous, and comparatively free. The Turks,with all their faults, have neverbeen meddling rulers. Their civilization has not yet attained the stage which is characterized by censorships and by repressive police. As long as the stipulated tribute is paid, the Principalities will be allowed to manage their own afihirs, without interference from Constantinople. The slight link of allegiance which still remains is, perhaps, the best security against the encroachments of more formidable neighbours.

TEE LATE MR. STAFFORD, M.P. The sudden and melancholy death of Mr. Augustus Stafford is an event at which we cannot forbear expreesing our regret. It C- tainly raises sad thoughts to see one In the fuli strength of life, with a high position and with abilities much above the average, thu cut o)ff. Mr. Stafford had been for maany years i betore the public as a Conservative supporter of Lord Derby, as a speaker of some force and humour, as a man estimable for: his social qualities, and latterly as a volunteer in the cause of humanity among the patients of Scutarl. That he should have left many friends to lament his loss in but natural, and we may rejoice that his most recent acts should have appealed to a larger circle, and gained respect for his memory beyond the limits of a class and & political party. MIr. Stafford, who was only 46 1 years of age, had been for a year past affected by violent pains, and, by the examination which took place after his death, is shown to have been subject to a painful disease, which at times threw him into agonies which were scarcely bearoble. With one of these he was attacked a few days since, and was shortly after bled and took an emetic. A quantity of laudanumn was also administered, to alleviate the excessive pain. From that time ho became gradually worse and, though everything was done to relieve him from the deep sleep into which he had fallen, it wax useless. Mr. Stafford died on Sunday last, and the circumstances of his death made it necessary to hold a coroner's inquest. The result has been to acquit the medical man, Dr. Griffin, of blame, and to establish that Mr. Stafford died from natural causes; though there cannot be a doubt that the opiates administered were unprecedentedly large in quantity, and might, without an excess of suspicion, be thought to have been fatal to the patient. The deceased gentleman, who assumed the name of Stafford after that of O'Brien some yeas since, had represented North Northamptonahire on Conservative principles since the year 18£1. At the downfall of Sir Robert Peel's Government in 1846 Mr. Stafford cast in his lot with the body which remained constan to the doctiines of Protection. This fidelity was rewarded by Lord Derby with the office of Secretary of the Andmiralty, which Mr. Stafford held from MArch to December, 1852. Circumstances connected with the general election of that year did not tend to raise the character of Lord Derby's subordinates, and Mfr. Stafford suffered even more severely than the rest. But a time was coming when great aud generous actions might be performed, the merit of which should be enough to blot out the remembrance of former failings. The year 1854 found the country engaged in a war for which neither rulers nor people were prepared. Europe had nearly completed her fortiethyear of peace, and England especially had acted as if war were thenceforth only the struggle of civilized nations against barbarous tribes in the remote corners of the earth. Often had the country been warned that military science could never be safely neglected, and the event justified the foreboding. But there was one point on which the world was utterly wrong. It was said abroad, anc repeated by the depreciators of their own age among ourselves, that the country had become selfish and unheroic; that our alliances and friendships and enmities were dictated only by ideas of commerce and barter, and that in private life the aim of each man was to be rich, and to enjoy the good things of life without thought of his fellow. How totally these assertions of ill-conditioned or ill-judging minds were falsified the course of the Russian and Indian wars has fully shown. The country was sorely tried, and on every side self-devotion and charity rose to meet the calamity. The Patriotic Fund was carried to an amount unheard of in the annals of private benevolence, and in a few weeks after the first disasters of Scutari reached the public ear numbers of educated persons of both sexes were ready to go out and brave cold, exposure, and fatigue, fever and cholera, in ministering to the wants of our soldiers. At such a moment it was only to be expected that a man of MIr. Stafford's kindness of disposition should feel the impulse which had moved so many of the benevolent. About November, 1854, he proceeded to Scutari and laboured with energy and success for a considerable time. A due tribute has been paid to these endeavours by the press and the public, and we believe that among the men whom he assisted Mr. Stafford wil have left memories which will not easily be effaced. His premature end will cause many regrets to the society and the political party in which he was known, but none more sincere than those which arise from the remembrance of the part he took in alleviating the distresses of 1854.

B INDIAN muTINBs. VESCRMION OF THE SIEGE O'F 7Tr.T-Tr The following particulars are extracted from an satereating letter forwaded to his father at York, aby yOulg man who was engaged with the 6th 4Dab inem in the assault upon Delhi: ts Delhi, Sept. 27. " De- at LX is in our possession, . . . My last letter was dated the 24th of August, xnd since then we have ad arrive 16 18-pounders and six 24*pounders, with six 30-inch rnorters, to augment our batteries, which were adVanoed from nearly a mile to under 200 yards from the walls, and, vith the guns we took from themn, numbered about G0 Iplaying upon the city at one time. We loat several men in the erection of the batterfes from the musketry from -ff the walls. The finest artillery officer, Captain Fagau, a gentleman who never left the batteriessinee our f.starrivsl ws shot dead at his gun. On account of the want of artil. Sery, we had to assist at the batteries. We had a sergeant ahot dead, and a private wounded severely. I may mention that the Ea1jah of Bareilly, with about 10,000 infantry, 21,000 cavalry, and 14 guns, took up a strog position in our jear, his object being to attack us in that quarter when they attacked us in front from the city; but as soon as we were 2nade acquainted with it a force was despatched to engage Lim. We came upon him about 3 In the morning, and, after a most obstinate fight tll 9, they were routed with kemendous losa All their guns, camp, elephants, camels, three lacs of rupees, &c., were captured. Three of the guns %vere of mnost beautifal make-all brass, and the King of I)elhls private property. " And now for the siege. For three days our batteries played incessantly upon the walls, where a slight breach was -aade. It was the opinlon of a great many that the sdege 'would go on until the valls wero levelled with the ground; Nat on the fourth morning every soldier was ordered to the Xront. The Rifles and 75th were to enter at the Cashmnera nate; 8th and 61st by the breach; Ghoorkas, Coke's Rifles, and 1st and 2d Europeaos to scale the walls. The Sepoys, meing the Rifles and Sappera marching on the gate, instead iDf allowing us to blow up the gates, saved us the trouble by *ioing it themselves, and immediately crossed bayonets with *aur Rifles, and owing to their inunense numbers kept their ground until the arrival of the 70th, who poured three deadly volleys Into them, and then gave a oheer, when the Eepoya turned and rarn under cover of two 24-pounders, loadedwith grape, in the centre of the street. Or fallows, seeing the flash, dropped on their faces, and wonderful to state, only four were wounded. That day we held one silde of Delhi, the Sepoys the other. Our loss was very severe, 'aut nothiing compared with that of the enomy. "General NIcholson (the 'Lion of the Punjab') was 'wounded while scaling the walls, and bas since died of his wrounds Captain Rosser, of my troop, was shot in the head. l'he ball remains there, and he lies In a very precarious eonditlon. A greats many officers were knocked over. 3larIng the day we took 114 guns and the remaining two magazines One of them bad as much shot and shell as 'wouldlast an army of 50,000 for three years, and guns of onornoos oalbre-6-pounders, but all without lUmbers. After the Sepoys were beaten back, street after street, the Xeatser part went into the fort, where the King's Palace is. Yor three days we bombarded it, throwing as many as nine 'shells a minuto; but so prodigious is its strength that very little nischief was done, our fellows not venturing In at the gate, on account of it being mined, and four 10-inch gns staring them in the face. At lsst a breach was made, and in a short timae the fort, Palace, and the whole of Dolhi was In our possession, after seven days' lard fighting, and, 1 am sorry to add, a severe los, mn our side. There are several officers andsoldiers here who served in the Crimea, anid doclare that Sobastopol aufferings were below their suft1rings here; and when the Indian summer monsoons and the repeated attacks from the Zepoys in thousands are considered, it in not to be wondered at. Before Sir B. Barnard's death our average loss was from 100 to 300 each attack. Since General Wilson took command (our Meerut brigadier), which is about six weeks ago, we bave not lost 500 up to the assault. As for a description of Delhi, If I except London, England, Ireland, or Scotland cannot produce its equal." Thme writer refers to the Palace, and says "The old King is in it, a prisoxer. Two of his sons are shot. Tho one who assumed the sovereignty of India has gone with the rebels towards Lucknow. Although their loss was roimendons, it is supposed their force gone away wa3 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, with a few guns, and an enormous treasury. General Havelock will talk to them, sno doubt. We have sent a moveable column of the Lancers, 75th, 8th, 61st, and the 2d Regiment of Sikhs, with two troops of horse artiliery, in pursuit. F For a description of tho riches of Delhi my pen is In. adequate. Cashmere shawls, inlaid with gold, bodices covered with gold lace, skirts of dresses, watches, bars of gold, beds of silk and dovw-n, such as no noblemen's house in England could produce-you would see Sikhm carrying out of Delhi the first day as if they were almost nothing. A Ahawl which in Eugland would fetch 1001. they were selling for four rupees, and you may depend our fellows were not behind them. . . . It is supposed the Rifle, will go to England with upwards of 1,000i. each, thou-h ,General Wilson has issued an order that the prizes shaUl b all put together and divided. Most of our men are worth uspwards of 100 rupees. . ,

"Last weck we received the welcomne news of the capture of Delhi and relief of Lucknow in such a manner as it does -ot leave the least shadow of doubt. The whole ciby was illuminated, d:reworks were let off, nautches were given, and the bankers and other respectable classes of the city waited upon the authorities, offered their unfeigned congratulrtions and nazranahs. The unfortunate 52d Regiment Bengal Native Infantry received an effectual blow from the :Iadras Artillery and lufan,rv; they were shot down like sparrows; the loss on our side was very trifling. The enemy, no doubt, would have dore a great harm if we had no artillery. Upwards of 100 were killed and the remainder evw like shots; some were hung in the field of battle, several have been apprehended and executed, to the great joy oEf the inhabitants, who assembled to see them suffer the last penalty of the law. By the indefatigable exertions of .Majors Erskine, Sleeman, Pinkney, and other officials, every order and security of life and property have been main-aned within the city up to this moment, but the neighJbouring districts trans and cis Nerbudda are in a disturbed atamte. Kuttung-gee, Mujholee, Seehora, Loharee, Boreah, IPatun, and other towns and vlllages have been plundered by the refractory Zemindars and Boon dailabs. Cap. *ain Clerk, of the 4th Madras Light Cavalry, DeputyCommissioner of this place, has gone across the Nerbudda to suppress disturbances and restore order. This officerhas greatly distinguished himself in detecting the machination and tampering of Ranjah Shunker Shah andhis accomplices. 'Wlthin the districts of Jhansi, Jalone, lutm Gurh ad 3Boondail hmund numerous petty Zeaindars have raised the -standard of revolt and rebellion. "Nursinghpore, Kundailee, Baitool, laooshunggabad, and Bhopal by the latesSt accounts are safe. The Beguma of the latter place proved herself a very stanch and steadfast adherent to the British interest at this critical jutncture. " Dummoh has been intrusted to the Raja& of Punna. The Msahrajah of Iteewah is still continuing to do good service to the Government, and there is every likelihood of his Highness's provim' faithfil. Mhajor Erskine works night and day, and is aaopting every precautionary measure aIgainst any surprise of the rebels. The day poor Lieutenant id'Gregor was buried numerous native gentlemen who attended his funeral were crying most bitterly. He was au amiable, goodcnaturcd young officer. "' We are all here very much in need of reinforcements. I hope to God troops may soon arrive here, and relieve us of our great anxiety and suspense of mind."

I1ELAND. I - - - - - b (FROMV Oul owwq COoxxCM!NDXT.) DIUBLIN, FRIDAY 0 ^Mo 6 ?MOXXrAY CRISIS. Ile Freeman's Tmirnml of this morning, in the course of some remarks upon the progress of the monetary crisis in England and Scotland, states that some vile miscreanta are endeavouring to create a run for gold on the branches of the rish joint-stock banks, the Provincial, the National, and the Bank of Ireland itself being the establishments selected as the intended "ictims of thi wicked nmachination. The PFreeman; observes.- All these establishments were, however, prudently pre. pared for the possible outburst of such folly, and gold was supplied in abundance to all the branches. In LIinerick and run on tbe Bank of Ireland, the Provin. o* the Savsi-bank was persevered i i fo a ine, ut hanond rou hoprornptness of these establishments to meet the dennd becaime evident, and some of those who withdrew depcsits and obtained gold are now retuminggthe gold to the banks. It is gratifying to see that in Ireland people are recovering their reason before the mania had time to do the only harm it was capable of doing here-compelling the banks to restrict accommodation. It is quite true, as 2'ti Times states in reference to the Bank of England, that a universal ard simultaneous ran for gold on all the banks would close every bank in the united kdngdom, and probably produtce almost universal bankruptcy. Bat no such rnn is possible, and no run that could be made in Ireland could do more than give trouble to the banks, and bring serious loss to the people who would be active in it. It could not Ijure the banks, which are now fuli- prepared to isueu any amnount of gold that could by possibility be de. manded, but it would ,DrOVe doubly injurious to the property of the country, aud brng irremediable ruin on many now thriving and prosperous traders." The Banner of MIsier, alluding to the last list of commercial disasters in England, mentions as a remarkable fact that only one of the many failures that have been announced has touched the merchants and traders of Belfast; and in this instaneL the effect of it will barely be felt by the two or three parties concerned. It is also a gratifying fact that there are no failures to announce in Belfast. There are, however, other announcements in the same journal which are by no means of the same cheering character. Of the powerloora weavers the Baimer says:- "*We regret to hear, although such a course was fully anticipated, that two of the principal firns in Belfast engaged in the manufacture of linen by power have resolved to run their engines short t me. One of the fgotories has already counmmenced working eight days in the fortnight, and the other will next week be placed on half time. Thls will greatly reduce the earnings of several hundreds of workers, and subject them to unusual privations, at the prosent high price of provisions. It is tobe feared that the remaining powerleoon houses will be obliged to follow the examuple. The reduction of hours has no direct connexion with the monetary crisis, hut is owing chiefly to the increase of stocks and the disincination to fulfil American orders, sheould such offer, or even where they are actually on hand." The state of the cross-Channel trade, too, indicatee a remarkablo depression of the trade between the twro countries,- " We underat;and-and are not surprised to learn that such is the case- thsat within the last few wreeks our import and export; trade with the other side of the Channel has been checked to a considerable extent by the present unsettle state of commercial and m onetary affair. Two steamers are nowv found suficoient for the Liverpool line instead of four, and those zanning to all the other ports in E1ngland and Scotland only obtain partial cargoes either inwvards r outwards. This is scarcely to be wondered at when the ci., rrard-bound trans-Atlantic steamners are leavnug with, in some instanoes, cargoes only one-eighth the usual amount." Bat it is in the sewred muslin trade-one of the most important branches of commerce inl :Belastthat a great check has been given to the prosperity vf the capital of Ulster. The failure of the house of Macdonald and Co. appears to have been severely felt in the north of Ireland. The Banner says: "That house had grown and grasped until It became too great for any ordinary man to manage its details. The engine, though unfit to drive the cumbrous machinery, wvas forced on, until at length the holler burst, scattering dismsay and destruction on all within its reach. It has been well said that, hadl the business attempted by the firm in question been done by 30 houses, the trade, the country, and wrorkpeo le would have | been much better to.dafy. The failure of Messrs. Macdon- ad has not only throwvn out of employment the thousands of w,orkers engaged by that firm, but the dread of the peremptory sale of their stocks of finished goods, and the effect it w ould produce on the markets for several months afterwards, causes far-seeing manufacturers to desist from production, well knowing that every jobbed parcel of goods destroys, for the time being, the real value of regular mnanufactures. This feeling, together vnths the late panic in 2New York and the pressure at home, has so acted on the trade here that not one in every 20 of the girls formerly employed is able to obtain work at almost any rate of wages. We must not omit stating that, whatever may have been the shortcomings of the firm o f MIacdonald and Co. as regards their policy in the market for goods, no charge could he made against them as employers; and we have hoard that since the suspension of thc firm every single piece of wvork in the hands of sewers through the country has been regularly paid for as soon as it was returned to the head warehouse in Belfast. As soon, however, as each sewver finishes, no further work is given . In the heyday of their enterprise the MIessrs. ac- donald kept about 15,000 hands in regular employ- I ment. Messrs. Lindsay, of Victoria-street, had several thousand girls at work throughout the country, Mressrs.f S3. R1. and T. Browrn were most extensive employers; J. and W. Wallace, Mfajor. Brothers, and a host of others gave full work and wages to almost incredible numbers of girls and womnen, hut nearly all such sources of labour have been closed up, and the vast sums so paid away no longer bring comfort to the firesides in cabin and cottage. In the case of the sudden collapse of the sewved muslin trade nso warning note told of conming ill. A fewYmonthsago the houses connected wvith the different branches were in full work, and prospects of an active trade for a long period were highly satisfactory. Irrespective of the tens of thousands of females 'who have been thrown idle in the provinces, there are nowr immense numbers of the higher order of wrorkers unable to find a single day's employment in Belfast. Engaged in the fnis of gooe's at the several warehouses in towgn two years ago there were about 500 young 'women, and most of them were of a very superior class, well educated for their rank, wiell conducted in their habits, and in point of skill unequalled Dy any other grade of female artisans, Besides these 'white workers,' there were not lees than 2,0001 girls and w omen engaged in the gray work-that is, in embroidering goods for the several firms, local and Scottish. The wages so earned added materiaUly to the weekly incomze of many a household. Good workers could earn 6a. to '(s. in the slx days, and oriiinary hands 'were able to make 3s. to Se. MIany of the 'wives of wvorking men 'were exceedingly expert in sewing, and, after having attended to household duties, could have earned ls. a-day. The total amnount of goods given out by all the houses in towvn at present would net, we understand, give wrork to one in 20 of these people; and in the mass of young women engaged in the finishing department the ratio of the idle to the employed is no less extensive. Up to the present, or at least until within the last fortnight, numbers of hands got Partial work in finishing goods which had been in hand at the timue of the first great7change in the trade; hut nearly all such sources of employment are now dried up, and thus hundreds of 'well-conducted and intelligent women wvill-niost of themt, at least-he left 'without means of As an instance of the gold mania among the farmers in the county of Limerick, the Evening Post narrates the following on the authority of a local correspondent: " A gentleman 'who fills several important agencies in the south was applied to by a groat many of the tesnants to identify themu at the different banks, whence they desired to withdraw their deposits. On1 the gentlems.n remonstrating with them on the groundlessness of their f ears, they put the sincerity of his explanation to this test-' Would he receive their draughts onthebanlks fortheir rent, not duetili Mtarch next, and give them receipts ?' He did so at once, and obtained checks for a considerable ameount." THEE POPE Am)D THE SEPOYS. The Evenivng Post authoritatively announces that the Most Rev. Dr. Cohlen has received 1,000 francs from, his Holihness the Pope, and 600 francs from the C7ardinal Prefct of the Propaganda, for the relief of the sufferers in India from the atrocities commnitted by the Scpoys. Perhaps after thin hint We shal on some early day hear of the Irish Roman Catholic clergy following inl the wake Of the Sovereign Pontiff, and evincing their sympathy in the same cause by appointing a day for a general collection throughout the wThole kingdom. BISROP DINTIR A'D TH EDUCATroN BOARD, Another turn has been given by the Cullen screw, and Dr. Denvir, the solitary episcopal supporter of the national system among the Romish prelates, has, it appears, succumbed to the pressure, and sent in his resgnation to the Commissioners Of Education. The Belfast correspondent of the Freeman writes: "You are doubtless aware that considerable dissatisfae. tion is felt at the spirit of the course recently pursued by the Commissioners of Education. There has been a very cautious avoidance of any overt act which might be made a palpable ground for open opposition to the proceedings of the commissioners, but there Is at the same time an 'under. current which has given great dissatisfaction in high quarters, and which has led to many serious conferenes aa to what course should be adopted. I am -not in a poea. tion to state whether it is in connexion with this general feeling or not that the event I am about to mentiorn to you occurred; but it is a fact, whatever may have been the cause, that the Right Rev. Dr. Denvir, the Catholio Bishop of Down and Connor, has sent in his resignation as a mem. ber of the Board of Commissioners of National Education. Whether this arises from an unwillingnesstobecompro. imised by, or identifed with, anything done by the boa, or from an inability to attend to its ProceednUgs with that punctuality which Is requisite to insure that due regard to the interests of those 'whom he represents which alone would be consistent with lls presence at the board I do not know, The fact I have stated, lscwevrez haresh.d me froma source which leaves no doubt as to the correctnes CwbAt I hgv statedo snd no 0ib t ko a v it ;a Dublin shortly after, if not, indee1, before the racelptof this cciynninlicaiion.?v THE TEDMOND ESTATF, The proposals made by ptivate conract for the purehase of the great irajority of the Iota of -the T.hcmond eatatea in Clare and Cork were submitted io the Commissloners on Monday and accepted.

CAMIBRIDGE, Nov. 20. The Syndlies appointed by Graco of the Senate, June 4, 1857, to consider the question of establishtng a system of examinations to be conducted under the authority and directioni of the University, either at CAmbridge or else. where, and of conferring certificates or some title of pro. ficlency on candidates not belonging to the University who may pass the examinations 'With credit, beg leave to report to the Senate as follows*- " After carefol consideration of the question committed to them, they are of opinion that, as a strong wish has been expressed in many and various quarters for the institution of such a system of examinations, it is desirable that the University should comply wzitht that wish and ondeavour to dischargethe duty which it has been called upon to under. " The Syndies submit to the judgment of the Senate the following propositions:- " 1. That there be two examinations in every year, corn. menoing at the same time, one for students who are not of more an 15 years of age, and the other for students who are not of more than 18 years of age. "2. That the examinations be held in Cambridge, and at the same time in such. other places as the Syndics, to be appointed as hereafter mentioned may determine. "3. That the subjects of examination be the English language and literature, history, geography, the Latin, French, and German languages, arithmetic, mathematics, natural philosophy,andsuch other branches of learning as the Syndic8, to be appointed as hereafter mentioned may determune. "4. That every candidate be examined also in religious knowledge, unless his parents or guardians object to suoh examination. " 5. That the students who pass the examinations to the satisfaotion of the examiners, be entitled to receive certificates to that effect. " 6. That the title of Associate In Arts also be conferred on those who pass satisfactorily the examination for students of not more than 18 years of age. " 7. That the students who present themselves for examaination be required to pay fees, at the discretioa of the Syndics to be appointed as hereafter mentioned, of such an amount as to be sufficient in the aggregate to defray the expenses of conducting the examinations. '8. That a Syndicate be appointed consisting of the Vice-Chancellor and of 12 other members of the Senate, elected by Grace, four of whom shaU retire in rotation on November 12 in every year, and their places bo supplied by four other members of the senate, elected by Grae at the next ensincg congregation, the retiring members not being re-eligible at that election; that on tho first election o such Syndis four members of the Senate be eleced to hold office till November 12,1858, four till November 12, 1859, and four til November 12, 1860; and that the Vice- anceUor or his deputy and four other members make a "9. That it be the duty of the said Syndics to apnoint the examiners in every year, to prescribe the subjects of examination, to fix the time of the examinations, the places where they shall be held, and the fees to be paid by candidates, and to determine generally all other matters connected with the examinations. " 10. That the Syndics be required to make an annual report to the Senate. "With referenctto the proposed title of Associate inArts, to he conferred on those who pass satisfactorily the examina. tion for students of not more than 18 years of age, the Syndies think it right to remark that they have found them. selves much divided on this point; but that they have been induced to submit it to the Senate by the consideration that the same title has been adopted in a statuto madie by the University of Oxford, aud that it is of great importance to tbe success of the proposed system of examinations that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge should act har. moniously together in the matter." The Vioe-ChanceUor invites the attendance of members of the Senate, in the Arts' School, on Tuesday, November 24' at 2 o'clock in the afternoon for the discussion, of the propositions.

DRATEx iN HE uNTiG FnILD.-An accident of a fatal character occurred to the lon, Martin Hawke younger brother of Lord Hawke, of Wormesley-hall, Ponterract, on Thurday afternoon. Mtr. Hawke was riding after Lord Scarborough's hounds, which had met at Parklane, near Hatfield, and were in pursuit of a second fox close by Baruby Dun, when his horse, a very fine animal, in eaping a flight of rails dro,pped short upon the fence, pitched his rider head-foremost into the adjoining field, and after turning a somersault fell completely upon him. Assistance was promptly rendered, vrhen the hon. sentleman was found to be bleeding profusely from the mouth and nostrils, and in such a dangerous condition tha,t it was deemed neces- ar'Y to remove him at once to the nearest house, Bramwithhall, the residence of Mr. Lyons Kerans. With a view to obtain medical aid as soon as possible the sufferer vias soon afterwards placed in a carriage to be conveyed to Doncaster, but it was foand that he was unable to bear the fatigue of the journey, and he was then taken to the house of Mlr. Newsome, of Barnby Dam, where he was shortly afterwards attended by Mr. W. 0 Russell surgeon, of Donoaster. On examiriation) It was found that the unfortunate gentleman had sustained very severe internal injuries four or five of his ribs being broken; and although ever thing possible was done for his relief he sank rapidly, and expired at about 6 oPclooli in the evening, remaining conscious up to within a very short time of his death.

" The few weeks that have elapsed since the publication of our last summary have not been without incidents of importance to the agricultural interst. That farmers as well as squatters have a right to enjov the use of a portion of the unsold Crown lands for depasturing purposes has been admitted by the Bill lately passed by the Assembly. WVhether this ever becomes lawv or not is still very donbtful;hut as the Bill now stands it Is proposed that, on pstition from the occupiers of cultivated land, the Governor in Council shall have power to set apart as agricultural pastur age an extent of waste land in their Immediate neighbourI hood equal to that held by the petitioners. ThiszreognitVon of the right of agriealturists to a share of the natural pasturage is of more value as a matter of princlple than for the actual benefit that wil be conferred on the present tilers of the soil by the Bill if it is finally paEsed in its present shape. This privilege is to be granted on terms which wil prevent many of the farmers from obtaining any portion of the so-called agricultural pasturage at all, and will not allow of its being turned to the best account by those who do. All lands taken from the licensed sqratting onpiers for this purpose are to be exposed to public auotion in lots of such extent as may seem best to the Land Board and let for one year to the highest bidder. Under this system of competition it is not probable that the grass land aet apart for their use and benefit will be divided among the farmers in proportion to the quantity of purchased land held by each. Even though it may be put up In small lots it is almost certain to faU into the hands of a few persons who viiU be able to pay a higher rent per acre for a number of these small alotments than each would be worth by itself. As these are only to be let for one year certain, it wiU not he worth the holders' while to fence them in, and but little use can be made of 0or c100 acres of infenced land. Of far more benefit will be the power proposed to be given to future purchasers of special country lots of not more than 160 acres each to occopy an adjoining allo'meut of the same size for pastoral purposes, for which he will have to pay a yearly rent at the rate of 6 per caent. on the value, with a right to complete the purchase a' any time within tSree years if he shall have brought into cultivation two. tbirds of bis own allotment. This provision will be beneficial to the settler, not only in giving him the use of a portion of grass-land for a time at a moderate rent, bu7t it will, n point of fact, enable him to Purchase a farm of 320 acres, or lses, and retain half the purchase money for three years for the parposes of improvement. To small capitalists this will be a very great boon, "A complete abstract of the statfstical returns for this colony was published last month, and from this it appears that we have made considerable progress during the year 1856. There has been a muoh greater increase in the quantity of grain raised last season than was generally expected. The yield of wheat is less than the average of the previous year by four bushels to the acre, belug only 23 last season to 27 in 1855, stil the total increase in the produce of this desoription of grain alone is more than 700,000 bushels. In the quantity of oats grown for corn there has only beern anincrease of some 30,000 bushels, and of barley 24,400. Of hay the quantity made in 1856 is les3 than was saved the previous year by mnore than 2,000 tons, and the effect of this, coupled with the high price of horse corn, is now to be seen In its enhanoed value, tbis article of produce belin at the present time in demand at just double the prace it realized this time twelvemonth. The extent of land undar hay was much greater last year than the year before, but there was a great falling off in the crop, the average being nearly one ton to the acre less. This is to be aecounted for by much of the late-sown and in. ferior wheat having been cut for hay when it became apparent that it would yield no corn. Although root-crops are rather uncertain in this climate, the cultivation of both mangold-vurtzel and turnips is extending-tho produce of the former havingbeen inoreaied fourfold, and that of the latter havingbecn doubled. Lastseason waa anunfavourable one for moat crops, and our progress in agricultural matters is better shown by the additonal number of persons who have turned ho that pursuit, and by the greater breadth of Llandunder the plough than for the actu amount of pro. duse zasiged - j 1%6 the numbor of oqooupiorg of pairXebvd Tinirwss 7,523; *hie it 1855 it wasonly4.326 thenumber of acMeu1rderscrop wi 179,982, oompared with 115,135 in thetterzyear.

YEGBORS AN7D THE SLA TRADE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-We hear a good deal about the duty that jlies upon England of sending out fleets and blockad-I m lg ports in all quarters of the globe for the suppres- Bion of the slave trade.I Doubtless slavery is an evll thing, is accompanied in its origin with horrors, and is, as an institution, maintained too often with a degree of harshne,s which revolta us. But even this is not invariably the case. However, putting this consideration aside, I wish to ask this question-How long are we, the hightaxed and over-worked people of this country, to pay for this ht1manitarian Quixotism? How long is the monev wrung from the thews, sinews, nerves, and brains of the most toilng people in the world to be expended in preventing African chiefs aud princes from selling their own people or their own kindred to the best bidder who anchors on their coasts? Have we not enough on our hands already but we must needs go and fight the mammon of umnighteousness for Quashee? Do we suppress the slave trade by our interference ? Are we near suppressing it ? Let Cuba and the Carolinas and Louisiana answer this question. All that we have done is to make the-passage a greater risk to the merchant and a greater cruelty to the victim; but the cotton, the tobacco, and the sugar of these regions are increasing with that manifold growth which was once the promise and the blessing of Heaven. Spain and the "States" have, and will have, their slaves, though our exertions may succeed in making them more costly and more sickly. And as the slaves multiply, so will their productions increase. But is this all? Have we done notbing else and nothing worse ? It is the alternative open to all men to become either warnings or examples. Which have we been ? Is there in the most narrow and bigoted corner of the Exeter-haU domain one being so blind as to see in our past African policy aught but warning, discouragement, and dissuasion ? Look to our West India Islands; look to Jamaica, to Trinidad, to St. Kitt's, to Dominica, to St. Lucia. Does the earth own possessions fairer to the view and more grateful for the labour of man ? Yet, what are they now? Wrecks, ruins, deserts; with the faint impression of former wealth and a fading civilization, which become fainter and fainter every year; with towns at once filthy, noisome, and pathless; with mansions, once grand and stately, tottering to decay; with Jew tradesmen occupying the houses and mimicking the display of princely merchants; and with a race of negro squatters parading their insolent idleness on lands which they have occupied without purchase, and exhausted without cultivation. Do not tell me of this or that week's price of sugar-of its increased production on some 2,000 or 3,000 acres in Trinidad and Demerara-of 1,000 Coolies sent here and 500 landed there, or of somo puerile scheme of "rProtection"' in Jamaica. All this is as a gnat to a megatherium. I am speaking of a grand empire-a bright conatellation of colonial dependencies planged into sudden eclipse-of a great bulwark in war cast down and dismantled-of a material elument of peaceful prosperity wantonly fiungmgaay-of a moral blight brooding overislauds which in other hands than ours, and under other counsels,tl%atn ours, might have been the suns and centres bf videspread happiness and civilization. In the face of so sad and gloomy a contrast who will venture to mouth hack platitudes about " the stimulus to industry," the "self-reliance of the planter," the "1 prospects of future market§," and all the trite trash with which the official sycophants of Exeter-hall have essayed to disgtuse the most dismal and disastrous state of our tropical colo. nies ? Sir, there is no blinking the truth. Years of bitter experience-years of hope deferred, of self-devotion unrequited-of poverty-of humiliation-of prayers unanswered-of sufferings derided-of insults unresented-of contumely patient.ly cndured-have convinced us of the truth. It must be spoken out, loudly and energeticaDly, despite the wild mockings of " howling cant." The freed West India negro slave will not till the soil for wages ; the free son of the ex-slave is as obstinate as his sire. He will cultivate lands which he has not bought for his own yams, mangoes, and potatoes. These satisfy his wants; he does not care for yours. Cotton and sugar and coffee and tobacco-he cares little enough for them. And what matters it to him that the Englishman has sunk his thousands and tens of thousands on mills, inachinery, and plant, which now totter on the languishing estate that for years has only returned beggary and debts? Hle eats his yams, and sniggers at "B Buckra." I know not why this should be; but it is so. The negro has been bought M ith a price-the price of English taxation, English toil. He has been redeemed from bondage by the sweat and travail of some milUions of hardcworking Englishmen. Twenty| milions of gold have been distilled from the brains and muscles of the free English labourer of every degree to fashion the West Indian negro into a " free and independent" labourer. " Free and independent" enough he has become, God knows, but labourer he is not; and, so far as I can see, never will be under the present system of things. He will sing hymns; he will quote texts ; but honest steady industry he not only detests, but despises. I wish to Heaven that some people in England-neither Government people, nor parsons, nor Dissenters-but some just-| minded, honest-hearted, and clear-sighted men, would go out to some of the islands-say, Jamaica, or Dominica, or Antigua,-not for a month or three months, but for a year-would watch that precious prot1g6 of English philanthropy, the freedr negro, in his daily habits; would watch him as he lazily plants his little squatting; would see him as he proudly rejects agricultural or domestic service, or accepts it only at wages ludicrously disproportionate to the value of his work. I wish, too, that they would watch him while, with a hide thicker than that of a hippopotamus and a body to which fervid heat is a comfort rather than an aunoyance, he droningly lounges over the prescribed task on which the intrepid Englishman, unaccustomed and uninured to the burning sun, consumes his impatient energy and too often sacrifices his life. I wish they would go out and view the negro in all the blazonry of his idleness, his pride, his ingratitude, contemptuously sneering at the industry of that race which made him free, and then come home to teach the memorable lesson of their experience to the fanatics who have perverted him into what he is. I shall be told that this picture is not universally true-that some of the neriroes are most honest, most courteous, and most mdustrious. I at once admit this. Some negroes-one-twentieth of the whole male population perhaps-are very cvil and very industrious. But who are they? Almost without exception they are old slaves. They are men who were formed in regular habits under good masters. But the rest, who were to realize the golden dreams of a " free, independent, and grateful" people-who were to show how far more productive a thing freedom is than slavery-they are what I have just described them as being. I may be told, too, that Barbadoes offers a otring refutatioon of 'ryaseto.Inm y respects it does. Fortunately for the Barbadian planter his little island is as full of inhabitants as * queen ant i of eggs. Fortunately for Barbadoes the pressure there has been that of people on sub s.' tonce, fiot' of reduhdadce on the people; -the labourers have been looking for masters, not tha masters for aen. Had the same thing beeA tue of I . I . . . the other islands, they-would probably have realized the same good fortunt. I do not admire the Barbadian nigger, but-I csanot but recognize his indu4try in raising the-Barbadian crops. This Ieads me-not, indeed, hopefully,. for I have already almost ceased to hope at all on this eubje6tto consider some scheme of salvation for us wretched Wet Indians. Is there no way of filling aome of our islandis with an adequate population-a population which will feel the stimulus of competition sufficiently to be urged to work t Is there no mode of inundating that proud and lazy Quashee who cumbers our lands with an influx of men who vill give a fair day's work for a fair dav's wages ? ee by blue-books-to such studies does calanity drive desperate men !-T see by blue-bookls that-for many years past Mauritius has had a constant ixnmigration of Coolies from India. In some years it has exceeded 8,000 men; in none has it fallen short of 5,000. I presume that in that island there punst be some protectivesafeguard to shield the CoolieYrom the sufferings, and his employer from the imputed despotism of slavery. Why should not these sifejguards be nade available in the West Indies V If this is done in the East, why should it not be done in the West ? But we can't get Coolies from India; the voyage is long, tedious, exhausting, fatal. True. But will not Africa give us, or sell us what India can'tgive us? "H Horrible idea ! to tuy Africans-it's 'the slave trade over sgain." Pardon me, dear madim, or Rev. Sir, or Most Rev. Lord - not exactly. Do as vou will, devise as you can; yet .the African vill be bought andsold. Its thefashion of his country. It is the revenue of-his princes -Zthe amusement of hia fellow-subjects. They join in a slave hunt just as joyously as, Farmer Hodge's ions follow the Squire's tounds. It is at once a souroe of booty and excitement. Against this twofold attraction war schooners and gunboats are unavailing defensives. All these thiogs may make the captured wretch's voyage more painful; but they won't make his labour a whit the less effective when he gets to Cuba, if ever he does get there alive.. All that your present policy effects is to consummate the ruin of the West Indies, but not to retard- the prosperity of other slave-owning colonies. Every year the Spaniard, the Dutchman, and the Anierican is growing rich on the toil of the slave, while the English ex-slave is battenig on the abandoned pro. pertles of his beggared master. If you buy these Africans they can be made free at once-can be engaged to work only accordidi& to fixed rules, for fixed wages, and, after an apprenticeship of five, six, or seven years, they can be- adnutted to the fullest benefits of citizenship-i. e., supposing that they can spak the English language. Your colonies wiU be ct ivated, the English consumer will pay the English employer of free labour instead of paying (as he now does) the foreign employer of servile labour. The freed ex-slave or his son who now looks down upon the toiling Englshman wil be jostled by this unexpected dompetition into unwonted energy; and the supply of the markets of Europe will be taken away from the sdave-owner of America or Spain, and given to the new laboaring population of the British Antilles. But, if something like this be not done, what' will be the end of our present system? Year after y'ear theWestIndies wiU becorae more poor and desolate; one by one, each English family, despairing' and heartbroken, will retire to the United States, or betakle themselves to a life of savage solitude. I presume that every British military defence will be withdrawn also. The fairest lands on the earth's space wiU be owned in squalid sullenness by a race to whom liberty and abundance have taught only sensual indulgence, canting hypocrisy, and bombastic pride. Nor- wiUl this race long abide. Deprived of the moral influence and moral support once afforded by the presence of the white man,-deprived of all that giver stability to their civil and purity to their judicial institutions-the community of aspiring mulattoes and self-complacent negroes wil descend into that z mimicry of civilization which alone separates the Creole of St. Domingo from avowed barbarism, too happy if they escape the meshes of slavery which threaten to close around them on every side, and which it will then rest with Spanish or American policy to spread again over the once emancipated British slave. I can foresee no alternative to this dilemma. Give us a labouring population. Give us men who will work themselves and by the force of competition force the sluggish denizens of the soil to work also. Give us the nucleus of a free but really industrious population; but-if you do not do this-at all events, after pillaging us, do not tax the people of Eng-land for any efforts to make Quashee an independent idler. The Spaniard and the American will have, their slaves. Your own example has taught them this. Speak to them of abolition, and their answer is a ready one:" We have seen what Great Britain has done with her West India Colonies." Againsttheseductions of their own interest and the warnings of our failures it is vain to strive. The one solitary argument which could convince them of the advantage of emancipation and induce them to imitate us would be the creation of a labouring class in our own colonics. When they do witness such a phenomenonwhen they see our abandoned properties revived by the toil of the freed negro-then will they be ready to substitute freedom for slavery, and not till then. And, indeed, this would be the almost certain result of such an experiment, even if tried with Imperfect success. It would be impossible to multiply free labourers in the British colonies and to extend slavery in neighbouring dependencIes at the same time. Half a million blacks dispersed through a dozen islands more or less distant can have only a very slight influence on the fortunes of their neighbours. But it would be quite another thing if a million or a million and a-half of negroes were earning the wages of free labour and were cultivating the soil throughout the British plantations. Such communities, governed by British law and disciplined by British order into habits of steadiness, industry, and prudence, would contain the germ of a body,which would surelygrowby accretion from without. A servile rising in Cuba or the Southern States would be no Idle threat, under the pressure of great Icruelty, within the contiguity of a kindred race enjoying freedom. And the temptation to exteud I slavery would be removed by the spectacle of free labour devoted to colonial produce. Suclh a spectacle would offer the greatest encouragement for the |abolition of slavery all over the world; or, if it did not do this, Woould present the most formidable discouragement to the slave trade. But if we are' not to try this experiment, for Cod's sake, do not sacrifice English pith, toil, and money to Quashee. If Quashee won't raise cotton, sugar, and coffee, don't pamper his idleness by reducing other tropical colonies to the state of our own. Do not enter on a crusade to forbid the nigger from worldng. Cruelty to the African may be a bad thing; but, in my opinion, cruelty to our own kith, kin, and countrymen is rmuch *orse. And our present system involves both kinds of cruelty. I am, Sir, your obedient servant EX-PERTVS.

FOBEIGN INTEBLLIGENE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN OOBRE8PONDRIT.) I& portion of the foUowlng appeared in oux iooond od. liono vesterdAi':-I RAMlS, THURSDAY, Nov. 19, 6 P.M. According to all accounts, the Danubian Princlpalities r getting more and more troublesome. Despatches received to-day from the French ConsulGeneral are said to confirm what has already been atated, namely, that the ultra-Radical party at Bucharest is urging the population to extreme measureL It appears that a seane in the style of &he famous oath in the Tennis-court of Versailles had nearly taken place. Baronde Talleyrand is instructed to do his best to moderate this effervescence of the public mnind, which, if not intentionally provoked, might have been discouraged from the beginning. TFne Consul, however, adds that the iatervention of all the European agents wtihout exception will pro. serve the country from further agitation. The Mcf.ateur de la Flotte pablishes a letter received from China by the last mail, which contains some partioulars relative to the mission of the Russian Admiral, Count Putiatin, to that country. The Count reached the Rusian settlements on the Amoor in 70 days. He embarked on board the R.usaian steamer America, and visited the Gulf of Petcheelee previous to his arrival at Shanghai. It was reported that he was accompanied by four other ships of war, but that fact is very doubtful. It is known that at Peiho he forwarded a message to Pekin, and it is thought that when he quitted Shanghai without mentioning his destination it was to seek the reply to that message. Admiral Putiatin's Becretary is, it appears, a person who resided 12 years at Pekin as chief of the College of Interpretera. The Russian Plenipotentiary announced at Shanghai that he came to act in concert with the British and French Ambassadors, and that he entertained no doubt of their being received sat Pekin; but he was of opinion that the Emperor would not allow any permanent legations in his capital. A letter from Singapore of the Lt October mentions that the French frigate Audacleuse had made the passage from the Cape in 51 days, and the commander was to leave on the 2d October ';o join Admiral Rigault de Genonilly, who was at anchor in Castle Peak Bay. The French corvette Capricieuse and the screw transport Durance were anchored at the mouth of the Yang-tase-Kiang on Sept. 14. They had fortunately escaped a typhoon, which caused much damage among the sipping at Shanghai. Typhoons had set in with much violence in the north of China, but none had been experienced in the south. The French Admiral, the Moniteur adds, had stationed his ships so as to be safe from their effects. A Chamberlain of the Emperor of Russia is at present in Paris commissioned to engage profe3sors for the Academy of Music which is under organization at St. Petersburg. M. Fould, MIinister of State, leaves this evenmng for London on, it iss mid, a mision purely financial, and relating to the present crisis. The Emperor returns from Compiegne on Sunday.

TTALY. (FROBI OUR ow coWN sCroDMT.) TURIN, Nov. 17. 1 am confirmed in the opinion I yesterday was disposed to entertain, that the Liberal party is not well pleased with the result of the elections, as far eB k;nowrn, and that the Right1 the clerical or retrograde party, has improved its position, although not to an important extent. You have already been informed of the chief causes of this check to the namely, their own confidence, and the uwearying exertions of their opponents. After being unreasonably buoyant and sanguine. they are now unnecessarily depressed-unnecessa: rily, because the harm done is neither serious nor irreparable. It is good, however, that they should be a little alarmed, if only to restore unity of action, the want of which has been a principal cause, in various places, of the success of their opponents. If they work well at the second electionstheywill still havea strong majority. According to the estimate of the clericals themselves, they have but 16 acknowledged supporters as yet elected out of 115 colleges. For the second elections which have to take place in many of these colleges they put forward 28 candidates. If half of these were won, which is at least doubtful, they still would have but 30 votes out of 115. But it must be borne in mind, in explanation of the anxiety of the IAberals, that the Chamber consists of but 204 members; that when two-thirds of them are assembled it is more than the average, and that a well-managed Opposition, with a good whipper-in, which keeps its memabers on the spot in readiness to combine (when the occasion offers) with another and weaker party equally hostile to the Government, is an adversary not to be despised. The Liberal papers of all shades today preach union. Some of them would have done better to think of this rather sooner. On Sunday, the very day of the elections, the Diritto, organ of the Left, was busy sowing dissension. Today it does not retract, but declares that this is no mnoment for discussion, and swells the cry for concord and harmonious action. The want of this has certainly been very injurious to the Constitutional cause. Overweening confidence, leading to the most erroneous estimates, ha been the root of the evil. The Liberals, if not blind to the proceedings and efforts of the priest party, at least undarrated their importance, and almost despised them. Extravagant calculations were indulged in as to the results of the elections by men whose position and opportunities should have enabled them better to know what was going on. Thus, it was said that Solaro della Margherits would be hard run to obtain a seat; and that, although he would get in, it Would only be because he was put up at so many places, at some one of which he would, doubtless, succeed. Now, the returns hitherto known shofhis election in three different colleges. In contrast to this success of the champion of the Right is the position of the two least popular of the Ministers, 8ignori Rattazzi and Lanza, who go to second elections; and the latter of whom, it is thought, miay very possibly be there defeated To give the priests their due, they have worked well, if we put out of sight the fact that they have been perfecdy unscrupulous as to the means they employed to influence voters. They have employed religion as an engine of intimidation, and have meade promises which, if their party came into power to-morrowr, they certainly could not fulfil. R(eduction of taxation has been one of their baits and rallying cries. The ignorant part of the population knows well that mince the constitutional segirne has been introduced it has been more beavily taxed than before, and does not understand how far this is compensated by the increased and ncressivg prosperity of the country; and it may not be difflcult to persuade it that a return to the former state Of things would lighten its burdere. It ix very difficult to see how the erical p , if In power, would manage to leam these, unIin, indeed, at disbanded the army, and mid, mu i ChAee Felix, that " Austria had half a million bayonets quite at his service, and he needed no other troops." NAPLES. (moir oun Owi cOPMPONDUM.) NAPLE8, Nov. 14. I trust that I shall not be considered tedious in again inviting attention to the case ofthe British subjects now m confinement at Salerno. New facts are continually brought to me, proving the correct. ness of my former etatements, and showing the shameless injustice of this Government. I consider, therefore, that I should be deficient in my duty were I not to make the following statement, which proves how much the Ring of Naples dares. The facts, wherever they are known, have created the atrongest feelings of disgust and indignation among the Englisb, and of astonishment among the Neapolitans; and while all the members of our little colony are disposed to ask what may not befall ourselves when so utterly abandoned by our own Government, the natives remark with a sneer, " We thought that no one would touch an Englishman." Touch Englishmen I Why, they have manacled them-they have shut them up from all human intereourse-they have kept them now for the fifth month in prison-the " Cives Romani" have not been treated with the justice of the INeapoltan law, much less with courtesy, and one has been driven into a state of desperation. And now for some new features in the circumstances of the case, to which, through you, I Invite the attention of every man who calls himself an Englishaan. Our countrymen, who have been treated as I have described, are innocent of the charge brought against them. In evidence of this I cite the assertions of several of the 11 prisoners who were liberated the other day and sent home to Genoa. They declared that when off the Wsand of Ponza men armed with pistols stood guard over the engineers and threatened to blow their brains out if the machinery got out of order. Moreover, they added that the engineers were perfectly innocent. Asuming, howsver, that they were guilty, what can justify the i1legality which my last letter showed had been plainly committed as regarded them-I mean the illegality of cutting them off from all intercourse with the outer world!? About theend of last month an English engineer applied to the B3rltish ViceConsul at Victri, near Salerno, for asaistance to procure permission to see them. It was Sunday, and therefore the next day was appointed. On the Monday Signor Consiglio saw the Attorney-General of the Grand Criminal Court of Salerno, who refused the request to see the prisoners, but permitted a written communication. They were asked, therefore, what they wanted. Money was sent to them, according to their request,andan acknowledgmentof the receipt of it returned. An arrangement had been made to visit Salerno again last Monday,but, as it is supposed, in consequence of a caution which was given, the Idea was abandoned, and no other attempt at communication has been made since the one I have described. On that oocasion I learn that the likeness of the engineer who made the visit was taken, and a detailed description of his appearance written. Now, then, as regards the British Acting Consul. Wve all know that he has left no step untried to procure an interview with our fellow-sub'eeb, and I have reported that Lord Clarendon had directed Mr. Barber to make a formal demand to be permitted to see them. The particulars of that demand, however, I did not know til recently. Some time has elapsed since Lord Clarendon telegraphed to the Acting Consul, Mr. Barber, that he sbould make a formal demand to be permitted to see the English engineers. The demand was made and formally refused, the refusal being grounded on an article which had nothing in the world to do with the point-an article, forsooth, which forbids a prisoner to see his advocate until the atto di accsa has been sent into the court. The answer, such as it was, was telegraphed off in haste and by order. But since then nothing more has been heard, and the engineers are still in prison. The atto di acctsa of the Procurator-General h;a been sent in to the Grand Criminal Court of Salerno. It charges 280 persons with being accomplices in the affair of Sapri. The Court ls now occupied inl drawing up the consvitutithat is, in conducting the examination of prisoners with a view to confirm or reject the demand of the Procurator-General. In the former case the trial proceeds, in the latter it falls to the ground; meanwhile, the Court may take six months in drawing up the constitufta, or even double that time, as the Government may please. The Blandford case was finally decided yesterday, and in a way which will afford additional protection to British residents against the thief or the assain. The Attorney-General demanded that they should be condemned to the third degree of irons-that is, to from 19 to 24 years. The Judges, however, after a private discussion of two hours7at the end of the trial, decided that Pasquale de Leva should be sent for 19 years to the galleys, in irons, and Francesco Marino for 1.3 years. Two criminals in the same prison, who had been called by Marino as witnesses in his favour, and who perjured themselves, have been ordered to take their trial for perjury, and will, if the charge be made good, be condemned to 13 years ia irons. The prisoners have all the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, but they will scarcely avail themselves of it, as the interval would not be counted in their favour in the event of their sentence being confirmed.

MP. MIAZL ON INDIA. (From the Bolion Spectator of Saturday, November 21 ) I A large meeting Was held In the Temperance HAl1, Bolton, on Wednesday tevening, under tbe auspices of the Society for iUberatig the Church from State ControL The chair was occupied by mr. Crook, one of the members for the borough. After a few appropriate introductory remrks from the R Wr.LJ, a w, the secretary o the assocition, rose to move the following resolution .- That reoest prooeedings in Paliasent, seoognJzlng as they have done the pi ncile of relioUs equality, afford to tbLs mee'ac cause for the wamest congratulstton; and, belleTig that th. .abours of the Liberation of lgion Socet7 have geastly ontrlbuted to such rs,uik, this meet deems it a duty to give it a stead: and liberal support." Mr. MI/ALL came forward amid much cheering and s-id. -Will you permit bae, before I proceed to the spcia resolution which I have to offer to the notiee of the meeting, having been engaged for some fyears, in company with yourself, Sir, m fighting the battles of the people, civil and rellgious, in the Ouse of Commons, to congratulate myself n placing myself this evening upon a platform where you are taking the chair, and where your constituency is the audience to be addressedt (Cheers) This is tot the proper place, Sir, or time for paying unmeaning complimen', but I do feel a pleoure in theo recollection that very seldom indeed, In many hundreds of dlvisions In whioh ewhave both voted, have webeen In differenilobbies. Ordinarily our sentimenta upon publio matter; have so far and so nearly harmonized that we have voted alike, and so far as our efforts could extend those efforts have been energetically made in favour of the same objects. (Cheers.) Perhaps, too, I may be allowed just to say, although I am aDisenter and never shrink, whether here or eleewhere, from avowlng my opinions (applause)-ani avowiug them, too, with a feellng of exultation-yet I do not appear on thiis occaion, nor whenever I rlse to advo. cate the principles of Uhis association do I everappear, sdmply as aDiseenter. (Cheers.) I do not t41nk Dissentlinterests, as they are called, merely as such, would be an adeqte object to call forth a public agitation such sa tbis. I would not, for my own part, leave my home-I would not encounter the sacrifice both of time, and of labour, and of anxiety necessary on all these oocasions merely for the object of promoting that which will be for the benefit of the Disenting portion of the community alone. I rejoice in the unsectanan charaoter of this asociation. The object that I have in view Is national In the fullest extent of the term. It as nearly affects the interests of the working men who may not happen to be attached to any religious denomination as It affects any reigious denomination itself. (Hear, hear.) Our object is liberty-slmply liberty in the sphere of religion. We believe that Christaity, if it be worth anything, canstandalone; thatwheneverChristianity has proved itself to be able to do anything it has done it by its own energy and zeal; that as soon as it discovers its impotency to effect anything It is utterly worthless for the purpose for which it came Into the world; that if it must be supported by law, then it is not that scheme whioh cvan regenerate manlind. (Cheers.) If it needs compulsory taxation in order to support its ministers, then It has not that persuaslve power Which can lay hold of the consolences of men in generAl. If it hs virtues of its own, those virtues will display themselves best apart from all law and apart from all compulsion. If it has the beauty to win the heart, let that beauty be unencumbered with worldly trammels. Such is simply the principle we proclaim; such in simply the prindple we wish to apply to the religious institutions of the country. I have not the slightest desire to see-I will not say destroyed, but even dliinshed in activity or power, any one of the denominations of religion in this land. Those whio:i are now in asociation with the State I believed would be greatly advantaged by an entire releasefrom the State (heara hear); and could we by the agitation we are carrying for. ward, or by any other means, persuade these denominations to carry out our principles legitimately, there Is no part of this communit that in the course of a few years would b3 as disposed to overpower us with their gratitude as th3 members of the Church of England. (Cheers.) They wear the chains, and it is their chains, as wel as onr own, that we are attempting to knock off. The Iron has entered into their soul; and if there is one thing more than another makes me desirous of seeing the object at whlch we ara aiming speedily and fully aocomptished It is just this-that the system reacts upon the men; that It dwarfs their sympathies-that it stunts all their religious affections-thst it produces intense sectarianism, not only in them but in those to whom they are opposed; and this disoriers and deranges all the machinery of religious conversion, depriving it of more than one-half the power It naturally posseesed. (Cheers.) It wMil not be necessary for me, alter the speech of my friend Mr. Williams, to go Into any detailed illustration of that principle whichI have endeavoured to put before you in all its simplicity and in all Its breadth; out I would rather take a somewhat more unusual course, and adapt the remarks which I have to make this evening to the special circumstances of the nation at the present moment. THear, hear,) I am glad that the resolutlion which has been intrusted to my hands wil admit of my doing this without appearing to wander from the object we have In view, and, therefore as the foundatlion of what I shall continue to say, I wil; read the resolution Intrusted to me .- " That In antolpaztln of lmDortaat changes In the Government of ourlndinmptre this meelg deem Iimportat to gire erpralon to the oDinion that the only poloy adapted to the circumstances o; that ouantry Is one whioh shal, on the one band, refrain from affordIng any iniD oc iaupport to the religious opinlons and rltes of the nativeTDDuation; and, on the other hand, wil afford unrestcted scopeto the teaching ot ChrelaUiay without any employment of fores or public money or petronsgo on its behal4" (Applause.) Perhaps you will permit me, in dealing with this resolution,to indulge in that freedom of remark which is somewhat hecessary to its proper elucidation, but which possibly might be deemed in some measure to compromise this association in political views I may hold for myself. I speak, therefore, simply on my own responsibifity in those poltical observations I may fed It necessary to make, and in introducing to you remarks which appear appropriate to the resolution, I do not involve in any way the character, the reputation or the conduct of those who mayhappen to be associated with myself in the affairs of this society. Let this be distinctly understood, that in speaking of the Indian empire, so far as the views which I profess are political in their character, I speak my own individual views only, and disclain assuming responsibility for any other party what, ever. Now, I start with the opinion which I hold mvself, with al that strength and depth of conviction necessary,as, I think, to give truth to an energetio course of conduct in any man. I believe that it Is necessary that the British supremacy in our Indian empire shoed be maintained an retained at any cost. (Loud cheersm) There are many who may possibly differ from me In the view which I take on this subject. I do not for myself, In the slightest degree, pretend that that suoremacy was achieved by us by means that commend themselves either to my understanding, or to my sympathy, or to my principles. (8ear, hear.) I believe that those who are most closely and most thoroughly conversant with the history of the Indian empire will be the first to admit that in the attainment of that empire, and in obtaining the grasp we now have upon the different populations of the East, crimes of the deepest dye were committei by our countrymen. (Hear, hear.) Fraud and violence were the principal instruments by which that empire was obtained; and I am verv sorry to say that, to a very considerable extent, fraud and violence have continued to be weapons too familiar to the Governments of India even down to t e present day. (Hear.) But I cannot shut my eyes to this conclusion, thatif we werenowto retire from the position in which we find ourselves, possibly by the crimes of our forefathers, we should not yield a compensatlon to those populations who are subject to our sway, but rather delve ! them over to worse anarchy, cruelty, and discord, than any of which those who conquered the country can be held to have been guilty. The very evil of the means by which we have come into possession seems to me to bind upon our consciences that we should not increase the evil by letting go the posseesIon. But the possession must not be for our. selves (applause)-not for the ngtificatlon of our lust of power and dominion-not for the extension of our tradenot for the encouragement and the patronage of our upper classes of society-not even to put food into the mouths of the working population, Important as that maybe; but if we are to hold India we should hold it for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, and to pay back something of the dehb of justice that is due to them on aocount of the crimes comnmitted by former Governments and by eivil governors. We hold India tbat we may develope Its splendid resourceswe hold It that we may diffuse peace and plenty amnong the people-and, above all, in my conviction, we hold is under the sanction of the providence of Almighty God that we may exhibit to India the beauty of that Christianity wbich we profess-that we may send forth to the sons of India the religion which wIi overturn one of the absardest the vilest, and the eruelest superstitions that ever debasei the human mind. (Applause) But if we hold upon those terms, recognizing our high respons3bility and keeping constantly in view the great spiritnal end and objoet of our mission there, it is of tho last importance we should not err repecting the character of those means we are to employ, in order to diffuse what we call and believe to ba the blessings of civilization and Christianity. If, for example, any Idea were entertained of reproducing in our eastern empire what we see at home; if we are to have a(lre ) slendid hierarchy;- if we are to have a clergy buardeninI ti resurces ofthladifwar to have a law comipollng axaionforthesuportof religions aol chritia intittios; f w ar tohave the slighte3t Interositon b lawto peven thefreest exercise of op~o amng he aties,the, Isay, It is bettr we JYar before that we s'hould not take uponL us the reposi bility of endeavouring to Persuade the natives that such Is our object when that would be a frightful Misrepresentation Of that system Of religion -which we aimn to introduce. Butt then, on the other hand while I would say -we must hav no establishment-no inteierence of Government, on the other hand, I say, and I say it decidedly, let Government perform it own appropriate functions, let what will be the preteno, an e iwill bethe consequence You now there are a considerable number of religions in Indin . I willno attempt to describe them to you now. The two grcat forms are those of the Mahomedans and thos, of the Eandoos. With respect to Mahomedans you know that it is a profession of faith in one true God, and that Mahomet was his prophet; but the grand characteristc of ihis spytm Is this-that it is the duty of exery trueO MUSsUlMan, so far as Providenoo allowed him the OPPoruaity, to propats His system of religion by the sword. With respect to the Hlindoo systemn, it would be difficutlt in a few words to convey to you any notion of the absurdity, of the impurity, end of the cruelty of that system. It has a, priesthoed-the Brahmins- consieting of a pecuar caste, receiving their privileges by inheritance and dent, and enjoying them without any pretence whatever of bepefiting the community, or of rendering to their fellow-men spiritual advantsges in return fortel eirtemPralbenefole buttmonopolizin In themselves and for themselves all the advantages whtich a priesthood can possibly monopollize, and this OR the pretence that they are a superior race. Thei religon rans into all the ramifications of socal life--it pervades au.1 governs almost all the domestic and Individual saeiong of mam and woman-it is a tyranny the most galling-an absrdity the sheoet absurd and offensive It Creates and keep, up anL ig norance as dense as can be found in SAnY part of the ~rozlJ AS oampletely elevates, at theepne of the rest of tes community, one particular cia., to doa thWY will With th,e rihts of all the others Such b the sytem among the Hindoos I believe they have about 800.000,000 deities, }whom they worship as divine. I will not offend you by attempt. ing to describe the celebration of their worship on their fesival days. I cold not do ao without exposing myelf to the reproach of exciting idess among an English audienoe that ought never to be excited; but the Government of the Easst India Company has actualy paid and supported lsoth these religions. (Hear, hear.) Aye, not only paid the Hmdooa and Mahomedans in order to the support of their several forms of worships but have actually taken care that the money which they paid should not be wasted upon the persons of those who pofessed to receive it, without the rendering of that religious duty for which the money was recetved. In every c¢lleotorte, and especially in the western part of India, a considerable portion of the rent paid to Government is subtracted by the collector before the sum is paid into the treasury, and is given either to the HIindoo or the Brahmin, or the afahomedan spiritual oMcils, for the support of their different temples ; and each one is obliged to bring in a oertificate from the inhabitants of the towns or villages that he has duly performed the re. ligious rites which he had undertook to perform. This is carrying out the principle of an etablishsment to a very considerable extent. (Hear, hear) We support church of Englandism here, we support Presbyterianism in Scotland, we support Roman Catholicism to a certain, and to a very small extent in Ireland and in the colonies, but to a large extent in CanD a; and we support Hindooism and Mahomedanism In our Indian emplre. But the Government have gone further than this. I believe that the system of caste in India, if left to itself, under the light of Christianity, and of the intellect which has been let In upon it by missionary operations, and by the presenoe of Europ1eans in the midst of the people,-I believe it has actuatly been on the polnt of giving ay. Indications appeared here and there that the system was relaxin$ its hold even upon the minds of the poerer clhses of society, and if it had been left entirely to ltsef to stand upon its own merits-or I would rather say left to fall by its own demerits-by this time it would have got ic roper .&6e But the Government of India, anxious to collect revenue, and desirous of extending its dominioa over the natives, timidly refrained from doing anything which could be regrded as offensive in the eyes of the population. They recruited their chief army-the Bengal army-almost exclusively from among the high oaste the Brahmins, who joined chiefly from the kingdom of Oude, and they indulged these soldiers in all their caprices, whims, ana faiaces For example, a cavalry soldier, being a Brahmin, vas always allowed an attendant of the low caste, who cleaned his horse and fetehed his forage because It was not becoming the dignlty of the priestly profession that the hand of a Brahmin should be stained by any such menial work as that. And soewith regard to alimost all the proeelytes connected with the system. Everything wasacqul. esced in by the Government of the Company-at least, sofar as regards the Bengal army-and you have seen for yourselves what have been the lamentable and destructive results. This army when unemployed has always been mutinous. Whenever it has had time to brood upon Itself it has always brooded evil and destruction. It was a sword, perhaps, well adapted for further conquest, but when once those oonquests had been attained the sword was snapped in the hands of those who wielded it, and you kniow with what consequences that result has taken place. (Hear, hear.) It Is impossible for us to read without interest and the most fiery indignation the atrocities which have been practised by that army-and I beheve almost without provocation-upon our countrymen in the East. While the native populatton may have had grievances sfficientto encourage an insurrction amnong them, the petted and pampiered Sepoy milltary never had a grievance which they could urge; and even the grievances which the did sometimes produce were so quicldy put on one diae and so muec dulgence was shown them, that it would have been im. possible for them to urge anything like a satisfactory reason for rsIngaga IsttheGovernment, lnthe employotf which they had laboared. But this recognition of heathenism has gone farther. You wil find that in the courts of law in Indis, when a low caste witness is produoed to bear testimony to any fact which is necessary in the determination of a suit, the matting is taken off the floor instantly, in order that the witness may tread upon nothing but the bare earth, lest, forsooth, the delicate sensibilities and feelings of a Brahmin secretary, or writer, or clerlk, should bo injured by his a pearance. (A laugh.) Wbat I say is this, that while Government on the one handmust do nothing whatever to Interfere with the professon or practice of the religious tenets held by the several religious raei India, yet Government must perform its own appropriate functions-it must do justice as between man and man, whatever may be the religious pretences that are put forward by any personit must recognize nothing, elther in the one case or in the other, by which to identify Itself with the religions that may be practlsed. Why, our soldiers-our Christlan soldiers-have been compelled by this Goverumont to go forth and fire a salute to an Hindoo idol on a festival day. have been furnished frequently as a guard of honour, aud sent to attend as a guard of honour even upon those rites and festivals that were characterized by excess of impturity and by the most vilainous atrocities. (Applause.) Now, all this comes out of one system-one princlple, and that is, pretending that the religious interests of the people are the affairs of Government. (Cheers.) I deny it altogether. I deny that Governments are instituted for the purpose of interfering between God and a man's conscience. (Cheers.) The relation in which we stand to the great Creator of all is too high and sacred to admit of any tampering with it by " the Powers that be." Let them bear the sword in order to punish evil-doers, and to encourage them that do well; but let them not pretend to intrude into that sphere where it is impossible for them to take any sdnpe step without trampling upon the very first principles of sprritual religion. They must either encourage one sect at the expense of all the others, and thus commit injustice, or they must encourage all sects equally, and thus show a contempt for sacred truti. (Hear.) But this is not the whole of the question. What I think the Government of India should be called upon to do is this, simply to abstain from interposition in religious affairs, whether they belong to the inhabitants of the country or to residents who may visit the country. Whether they are connected with Hindooism, Mahomedanism, or Christianity, let the Government abstain from interfering in any religous affair until man, under the pretence of religion, be to trespass on the rights of his fellow men. (Oheers. And when he does that, though he should obtain a commission from Heaven-though he shonld be able to open the Shaster and read you a prophetic rvelhtion from the Highest of all, let Government pay no being whatever on such a pretext, but wield the sword of justice, and declare that persecution shall not be practisod by Mahomedans upon heathens-that iniquities shall not be perpetrated by the heathen upon one another-that no man shall zuffer on account of his religious profession or his want of religious urofession (much checring)-at least in regard to temporal things necessary to his wellbeing here, and that every one shall have the freest possible scope and opportunity for endeavouring to bring in others withia the ranks of his ovwn religious system by moral and persuasive means. (Cheers.) We all know that this doctrine is popular amongstatesmenin Its applicationtolndia. Since the first rews of the matiny reached this country we have had the staterrent approved practicaUy by most of oar leading men who figure in Parliament; and I will do them tho justice to say that they do perceive the necessity of the times. Tbeyare quite aware that their system, fostered in this country with so niuch zeal and affection, is not at all app'i. cable to our Indian empire. Almost every principle which I have laid do wn this evening they yould lay down with the utmost closeness, accaracy, and precision in reference to that empire. I do not, therefore, despair of seeing this principle recognized in that act of legislation by which we sha11 attempt to reconstruct t ho now disorganized Government < f Iadia. The members of our constituencies, and the men who I hope will soon he Included among them (loud cheers), those who chance to have votes, anmdthose who ought to have votes (cheers), all of them may bring their influence to bear in the final satisfactory settlement of this question. I do not want to mix up tho Indian queestion with the question of the church of England. I wlil admit that as to some of the circuamstnces by which they are affected, the question stands upon rather different grounds. For example, we have an existin institution here- we have no such institution existingin India. Bat sare'y we may say this-surely, if even religion needed compulsion in order to give it success among the inhabitants,of a conatry it is not where the inhabitants of a country are Christians that it should need that compulsion, but where they are heathens, and consequently cannot recog-ize the virtue of the religion we introduce. If an esbliahment benaunecessary and impolitic-if it be irrational and inapplicable in the circumstances in which the Govermment of India is laced, much more it appears to me is it Inapplicable and rrMational-utterly unnecessary under the circamstancesin which the English population ig placed, because here, if we were to cast religion on its own resources, we are so consti. tuted that we believe religion has the power to make its own way, and would make it far better among the population in consequence of being removed from the patronage and support of Government than it does at the present momont; wheres min India the whole population is devotedly opposed to the iatroduction of Christianity, and one mus'. suppose, urder these circunmstances, that the religion which cannot maintain itself among Christians without the support of Government would be utterly inadeanuat to undertake the imissionary work of converting tfie heathen without at least equal support there. Bat I put all this on one side. I do not want to put the advocates of that sytem under a disadvantage. Let us allUconsider it our duty to labour hard and assiduously for the realization of thls beneimcent principle in regard to our Indian empire, so that there is no tampering with the fidelity and integrity of those principles in reference to that empire, because we owe the inhabitants of it a large debt of justico, and if we should attempt to impose upon them restrIctions of the same kind that we bave in our own land, instead of repaying our debt, we should only be adding largely to our liabilities and responsibilities. Tho time will come when you, as I said. berore, may do something towards helping on this great moverrment. The question will assuredly come before Parliamer.t. I know well how our hon. chairman wiUl vote upon that occasion. (Cheers.) The vote which he gives on Indian affairs will be in perfect accordance with the votes he usually gives in reference to English, Irish, or Scotch affairs. (Cheers ) But I trust the working men of this country wiU regard themselves likewise as under an obligation, whatever may be their own viewi of religion, of Christianity, and of its divine origin-whatever may be their viewvs, I trust they will come forward like men, and stand up before the Government, as far as the constitution gives them power of representing their own Ideas, and will say that they wll not allow Govarnment, in its sway over that empire in the East, to shrink in the least from its own responsibility, nor to take upon itself responsibility it cannot adequately sustai (Cheers.) They will say, "It is for you to do justice-to administer justice and equity between man and man. Touch not religion whether it he true or false; it is not your fuction. Leave that to the zeal of the disciples of every sect; clear the way for them, that they may have the utmost liberty of speech on all sides; let there be free discussion betv7een heathehism and Christianity; do not put forth your hand to support Christianity by yonr power, as though Chritlinity eould not gustain an argument with superstition; leave all free; bring in no suspicion even of ycur own interference in one way or anether; pay the pri&a of no denomination (cbeers); give the laund of th, country to the oeen ot no cied; exeroise your patronage an no us manner; eoablih nothing In the sbape of ecclesiastical law; but wbenever in any direc tion there is an invasion of the prncinlea of justice and equity-between mau and man, be it by CJbns or MAho. msedanaS or by Hlndoos, and that under a religious pretenoe, tel them you hear of no such pretence within your domain (cbeers)-that you bear notthe xword of justice In vTIn; Aad tbat the man who pretends in oonsequence of his intimate connexion with the God of heaven to Ihave the smallest right to injure his fellowman Phallhtandat tebtribianal of 3ustioe, and have the penalty of the bwy in. flicted upon him." (Loud and long cheering.) That is what we want for India. We have it for our colonies-for most of our colonies. I wish we had it for Ireland, and I wish we had it likewise for England; but it will come in good time. We havo only to work on. ,Work and wait." Be patient. The idea I am now propounding could not have been propounded among a patient audience 20 years ago Things are marching on with wonderful rapidity. I ear things, and I may anpeal toyour hon. chairman whetherhehasnotlikewisehead things uttered by men on the opposite aide of politics to us in the House of Commons,-principles to ne rlv our owzL that they appeared to be the image of one's own ideas, and we could not tell how that image came to be reflected upon their minds But so it is. Truth is far spreading, for I thinic the principles we hold are so far in conformity with the on sense ldeas of rectitudo entertained by mankdnd at large that we need fear standing on no pLat. form nor upon any foor. In tho House of Commons itself, whBich has usually been regarded as Impervious to thess high notions, these high notions have nevertheless made for themselves a wray, and, iE we only ursue our enterprise with suflicent zeal and mo Lration and charity, I believe the day Is not far distant when theproclamation shall be made through the breadth of this empire, whether on England's shore or on the shores of India, that Ireligion Is free to make her own disciples-that Government ia intent upon meting out jus tice to all its subjects ; and with a free relgion, ad Govern ment aiming simply atministeringjustioe amongitsubject there will be such social harmony and contentment, suc satisfaction, and such rapid development of all the great elements of prosperity and progress, that Ze need not despair of that which I for one am anxiously looking to behold-the universal spread of beneficent Christianity throughout adl the nations of the earth, (Loud and prolonged cheering.) The Bev. F s Iarv BAE1xB, of Bolto;s seconded the resolution, and it wvas carried unanimously. Addresses wvere subsequently delivered by the Rey. Edmund Clarke, Rev. Ir. Best, and Mir.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE T7rIMES. Sir,-That portion of your artille to-day on the monetary crIsis asks whether any discoverable fretures in the prevailing system of trade will account at all for the occurrence of panics, which produce so much misery and alarm. Many years' experience in banking and mercantile life induces me to volunteer the opinion gathered by that experience, that the immense amount of meney placed on deposit in joint-stock banks induced the mangers and directors of such banks to give extensive crodit by loans or discounting bis for persons without eapital. Money so ob. tained enabled speculators .to operate in the purchase of goods for exportation on the chances of a market in AustralLa or America. Illegitimate exports of this nature gave buoyancy to our manufactutrers' export trade, markets abroad are glutted with unsaleable goods, and no returns having been received by the shippers they have no resources wherewith to repay the loans or to take up their acceptances. Another cause of the evil has beeu the readiness on the part of some mercantile houses to make advances on shipments-a sytem partaldng strongly of that practised by marine store dealers and pawnbrokers-viz., that of aiding in the disposal of stolen -oods. The remedy which I propose is, that people who have loose money should not plce it In joint-stock bnks on deposit, but purchase legitimate securities in the shape of Exchequer-bonds and East India bonds, which pay interest day by day, and their principal money is secure. fAny of the railway and other reproductive works afford sound means for investment if restricted to such legitimato objects, Instead of being made the means of gambling operations. The advocates of a paper currency would drain our country of gold and silver by substituting for the precious metals the valuable documents of Pork and Co. upon Bacon and Co., and Bacon and Co. upon Pork and Co., and thereby briag the entire country into a state of pauperism. I contend there is never a scarcity of money; but wrhen that term is used it applies to the scarcity of oonfidence, and that the safest base for trade to work upon is judiolous etricture in the purse-strings.

Tim EvAoNaLIcAL ALLu.xc-Yesterday the annual conference of the members of this association, which was opened on the preceding day, was resumed at the Freemason's Tavern-Sir Culling Eardley, Bart., acting as chairman. The Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, Major-General Alexander, and a considerable number of clergymen and Dissenting ministers were present on both occaions. A letter addressed to the chairman by the Earl of Shaftesbury was read at the meetingon Thursday morning, on the vexed questlon of grants by Government in aid of national education, in which the noble Earl said,-" One thing is to my mind unanswerable. If the Government have schools, into those schools the Bible must be introduced, but if they do so, wil! there not be raised in England and India a cry of compulsory proselytism ? The solution of the dificulty appears to be that Government should give grants in aid on a liberal scale, and leave to missionaries and others the foundation and conduct of schools. The Government schools are not popular, and I should have very little confidence in their religious teaching." The Rev. J. S. Jenkiuson, vicar of Battersea, delivered the annual address at the opening of the conference. At its conclusion the chairman referred to the late conference at Berlin, which, he stated, ihad produoed a profound impression on the German mind, in which the King of Prussia bad shared, and which had elicited the Warmest assurances of Christian co-operation from the leading and thinking m en of Germany. The business of the present conference, he added, had reference principaUy to two points-India and Germany. He was authorized to state that their brethren in Germany had declared themselves ready to co-oprate with Eugland in any feasible manner to promote tho interests of British India, as had also those m France, Switzerland, Holland, America, and Sweden. The general feeling of Engnd at this moment was, that advantage should be taken of the outbreak that had occurred in Indial to disseminate the Goapel in that country in all its purity. On his return from Germany he had an interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and with the various missionary societies, in reemect to this subject, and the result was a determiiation on the part of thoas societies to carry forward a plan by which a simultaneous course of action would be pursued for propagating Christianity la India. It was intended to have a fund for the sutpont of Bible schools in the great cities of Hindostan, wfiere the Christian religion would be taught through the medium of the Bible in the vernacular of the country. Another object of the fund would be to assist missionary operations, eatab. llsh village sohools, and promote the rinting of schoolbooks in the native language, In which the leading features of the Gospel would be inculcateiL A scheme to embraoe those objects had been prepared by the secretary of the Chrrbch missionary Society, and was now under the oon. sideration of the various other Idndred societies preparatory to Its being brought fairly before the public, He was aware th.t the Evangelical Alliance had always prooeded upoan te principle of keeping aloof from politics; but at a moment like the present, when great interests were at stake, t might not be inappropriate to pronounce opinions which might possibly lead tO fnture action; and the council of the Alliance had come to the unanimous conclusion that Great Britain ought not, as a nation, to hide her oolous in the East that, on the contrary, she should publicly proclaim her religious creed as that by which Heaven was to be gained, and that there should be no reoognition of idolatry or of the corrupt religion of Hndogtn. On the motion of the Rev. J. Davs, seconded by Mr. Finch, a resolution was passed expressing the belief of the meeting that the pacification of India was only a question of time, and that they were now called on to propagate the Gospel with redoubled energy, faith, and prayer throughoutthe whole of Hindostan. A subsequent resolution, moved by the Rev. Marshal Vine, and seconded by the Rev. George Scott, laid It down as the duty of the Government and Parliament to manifest to India that England was a Christian country, that they ought in no way to sanction or encourage idolatrous and false religions, allowing, however, Mahomodans, Hindcos, and others to practise their religion in matters where public order and public morals were not affected. On the raotion of the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, a resolution was also adopted,indicatiug the necessity for a plan of itinerant preach. lng of the Gospel when tranquillity was again restored in India, but at the same time leaving missionary work, as such, to missionaty societies, churches, and othsrs. The Rev. Dr. Hoby, Professor Hopuz, the Rev. J. W. Borland, the Rev. Dr. Hewlett, Mr. Farmer, Major-General Alexander, and other gentlemen took part in the disoussion raised by the several resolutions. The conference adjourned shortly after 3 o'clock and reassembled at half -ast 5 in the evening, under the presidency of Mr. J. Hen3er. son, of Glasgow, when the report of the exeoutive councl vas read by the Rev. Mr. Dobson, and agreedJ.

ZA W BBPOQr. COURT OF OHANCERY. LtcoNogs-nri- Nn 90- _ . DIXON V. GAYFERE (SIDOMENTL (Bcfr-c aC.EL*D Cn"KcLO - *j.sa appeaL irom a deeree and anorder of ibe MAter of the Eolls was argued at the comineneement of the present term, and stood over for judgment. Thefact wae~that by an agreement dated the 26t.h of August, 1826 and made between Maria Finneane (who was entitled to salU a real estate) and Nathaniel Danbar, Dubar agreed to disarge an urtatisfied claim of 6001 on 3Mrs. inincane, "u1on having an assignment of all the right and interest of Mrs Finnoane in the one-half conveyed to him ;" and Lupon such assignment ir. Dunbar thereby, in conaiderat1pn of the conveyanc of such property, agreed to pay Mrs Fianncane 25L, and to grant an annuity of 501. per annumne during the several lives of three personsn mentioned, -to be Eecured by botnd," and Mrs F=nucane and Mr. 'nDaub thereby 'mutually agreed to perform all such further acts as in law should be requisite for the completion of the agree ment when required." By subsequent dealings the right to the half of the estate, which had never been conveyed, Tested in Fluker, and the right to the annuity, which had never been secured, and was greatlT in arrear, had become vested in Ba)Iey. By the decree in the cause, Made in Ie3, it was declared that Bayley was entitljd to havo the arrears and future paymentg of the at. nuity roperly secured, auch security to be settled by the Juge in chambers. Before the chief clerk Bayley contended that he had a lien upon the estato for th iconsideration to be paid for the purchase, and to have the nnuity and arrears secured by a charge on the property. On the other hand, Flaker insisted that all that Bayley was entitled to was to have the personal security ofthe purhaser or hiz representatives for payment of the annuity.. The point was xdjourned for argument before the Materof the Bols. His Honour held that Bayley had no lien upon the estate for payment of the annuity, and was merely entitled to have it secured by the bond of the purchser. roU this decison, and from the decree of 1853, Bayley appealed. The LoZD CHN cZLLoR. this morning delivered judg. ment, and Ead that the questlon &rose out of a number of suits that had been pending in this court for a period of 50 yeats. That question was whether Bayley wa entitled to any and what lien upon the estate In respect of the annuity, or was merely entitled to have the annuity secured by bond. The general law undoubtedly pve a vendor a lien upon the eatate sold for his purchase money, and suc)i lien was not even lost by his takhng a bond or any other security for payment of the purchase money. How did that law apply to a case like the present, where the consideration for the conveyance could not strictly be called purchase money, being, in fact, au annuity I He was of opinion that tho law did not apply, and also entirely concurred with the Master of the Rolls that the question whether a lien at6ched to the estate sold, where the consideration lwas an annuity, must depend solely upon the circumstances of eachparti. cular ase. He also agreed with his Honour th4t the circumstances of the presant case were such as to exclude the notion that the parties intended at the time the aggeemeat was signed to oreate a lien upon the estate for the annuity. ie would also state that he thould be slow at any time to oome to the conclusion that an estate was intended to be inalienable In the hands of a purehaser daring the whole time that any per. sons, upon whose lives au annuity in lieu of purshasemoney was secured, lived. The decree, however, was defective in not stating that Fluker had no rlght to call upon Bayley for a conveyauce of the estate until a valid and sufficient bond had been executed for securing to him the future payment of the annuity, together with all the arrears, and therefore it must be amended to that extent. (Before the LORDS JUSTicEs of APZ8,) Mr. Huddleston, one of the newly-appointed Qaeen's counsel, was this morning called within the bar with the ac. customed formalities. Their Lordships disposed of a list of lunatio petitions, none of which was of a nature to require a report. IN BDAiKRUPTCY.-ZX PAITE DEL, IN RE BAINBRIDGE .A,ND DEL. This was the petition of Mr. John Joseph DelL appealing from a decision of Mr. Commisdoner Evans, refug him any certificate. Messr Bainbridge and Dell carried on businees together as boot and shoe manacturers at No. 183, Southwark-bridge-road, for a period of five months, and at the period of the bankruptcy the debts were 2,700W, the ssets Il. 17s. 6d The learned Commissioner considered the case one of the worst that he had ever had before him, Dell having begun business when insolvent, sold at ruinous loss the stock, told gross untruths about his absent partner, endeavoured to cheat his creditors, and had uttered gross and glaring falsehoods in his balance-sheet and in his exaamination. The case occupied some considerable time, at the end of which the Lords Justices stated that it was not a case to induee them to interfere. They dismissed the petition, giving the respondents, the assignees, liberty to deposit money as some indemnification against their costs Mr. Baeon and Mr. DorIa were for the bankrupt; Mr. Bagley for the assignees.
VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS. nr 9m I2 RE TRE ESSEX GASIUGHT COMPANZY. (BBefore Yce-Chancdlor Sir R. T. KJ ii yjx) mr. .iLASSE and Mlr. W. D. LEWNIS appeared upon a petition In this matter, asking the usual order to wind up the Es3ex Gaslight Company in the ordinary manner. The petition was entitled in the matter of the company by dewagna. tion, and also of the Joint-Stock Company's Winding-np Acts of 1848 and 1849. Ar. ROxBUVRGH opposed the petition on the ground that the title of the Acts of 1848 and 1849 referred, in fact, to statutes which were not in existence, the title ought to have been in this matter of the Acts of 1856 and 1857 also ; and this was not a mere matter of form, but went to an amendment which was of a vital nature. A similar petition had been presented beforeVice-Chancellor VWood, whioh was rightly entitled. Mfr. GLASSjE asked leave to amnend, but The VICE.CHASCELLOR refused leave to amend, and (the petitioner not consenting to be dismissed) the petition must take its place in the paper as opposed. MARRIAGB OF A DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER. (Beforc Yicc-ChancdUor Sir J. STruAT and Mrr. Jusirce CRESSWELL.) BRoOK V. BROOK. The question raised in this case is whether the marriage of a British subject with his deceased wife's sister at Altona, in Schleswig-Holstein, where by the law of that place such marriages are legal, is valid in England, and consequently, whether, according to the law of England, the childiren of such a marriage are legitimate. The facts out of which the question arises are as follows :-In 1847 Charlotte, the first wife of the late Vihiam Leigh Brook, of Meltham-hall, near Huddersfield, died. By her he had one son and one daughter. In 1851, William Leigh Brook intermarried, at Altona, In the kingdom of Denmark, with Emily Arnitage the sister of his deceased wife. In 1855 his second wife, Emily, died of cholera at FranL-fort, and two days after her death Mr. Brook died at Cologne, also of the same disease. By his second wife he had one son and two daughters. Mr. Brook by his will gave his real and personal property among the children of his two marriages in certain proportlons. Charles Armitage Brook, the son by the second marriage, had died since the death of Mr. Brook, and the question in the case was whether his share of Mr. Brook's real and personal estate went, as to the realty, to Mr.Brook's sen by bis first marriage, and as to the personalty, among aU Mr. Brook's children equaUy, or whether Charles Armi. tage Brook's share of such real and personal estate went to the Crown by reason of the invalidity of Mr. Brook's second marrage, and the consequent illegitimacy of Charles Armitage Brook. Letters of administration to Charles Armitage Brook had not yet been obtained. The chief clerk by his certificate found that the marriage of Mr. Brook with Emily Armitage in the year 1851 was valid aocording to the law of Schleswig-Rolstein. By 5th and 6th William IV., cap. 54, it is enacted, " that all marriages which shall have been celebrated before the passing of this Act between persons within the prohibited degrees of affinity shall not hereafter be annulled for that cause by any section of the Eccleslastical Court, unless pronounced in a suit which shal be depending at the time of the passing of this Act, pro. vided that nothing hereinbefore enacted shall affect mxar. riages between persons within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity." Section 2 enacts " That all marriages which shall hereafter be celebrated between persons within the prohibited degrees of consangulnity or affinity shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes what. soover ;" and section 3 provides that " the Aet shall not extend to Scotland." Sir F. KELLY for the plaintiffs, the three daughters of Mr. Brook, said that he should not enter into the religions or social considerations involved in or connected with the policy of such marriages as that in question. There were persons who held that they were expressly or inferentially warranted by Scripture, that they tended to a great amount of acla' good; while others held that they were contrry to the Divine law and inconsistent with ChrlatlAnity; bat, on that part of tho question he should not touch. He should cnmfine himself strictly to the consideration and constraction #f the Act 5th and 6th William IV., cap. 54, on which the decision in this case would depend. It was a general rule in the laws of all countries that Ifges cxlra's tcrrito-iam non obligant. The question was whether the Act rendered such marriages unlawful only when solemnized in England, or whether it rendered them unlawful also when solemnized In tho colonies, or c fortiori in foreign countries. Wherever a statute prohibited or made any act unlawfal, such statute would not without express words to that effect or necessary Intendment have opertion out of Great Britain. That was a well recognised rule in the con. struction of statutes. The Sussex peerage cae (11, Clark and Fin.) would occur to the Court, in which it was hrild that the enactments of the Royal Marriage Act were personaL That construction arose from the peculiar wording of the Royal Marriage Act, and if it was intended that the Aot Of the 5th and 6th of William I V-,c5.4, should also be personal and attach to the persons of all Eglishmen wheresover they might solemnize marriage, whether in or out of England, why did not the Legislature, with the pro. oedent of the Royal Marriage Act before it, Ue aimilar langpageI An Act of Parliament might be so wordel mg to operate on all Englishmen everywhere; bu,uzlees it wag slO wrorded, its operation would be conlna wItIn the re&lm of England.

COIURT OF QUE-N'S BENCH, WESTMrSTIER, Nov. 20. FROST V. PRICE M'D OTHERS. iWinga in Baneo, before Lord CAMPrBLL and Jtuiiccs (OLEoIDGE, WIGHTMN, and ERs.) This was a speclal case, stated for the opinion of the Court without any formal pleadiDgs, and which raised the question whether, under the circumstances stated, the defendants, the underwriters of a policy of amarine insurarice, were liable. The insurance was effected upon the ship from this country to MAelbourne, and for 30 days after its arrival at the port of destination. On arriving near Melbourne the vessel ran ashore from perils of the sea. It was then surveyed and the cargo take; out, and, the water in her hold being lessened by pumping, the vessel was taken stanch and strong," though not " tight," to Sydney to be repaired. On the voyage the vessel started a leak, and n plank opened, which rendered it necessary to go near the shore, and there by the wind and waves the vessel was dashed to pieces, The question was whether the rlsk on the ship continued, or whether it was determiaed on the rarrival at Melbourne? Mr. J. WILD£, Q. C., for the plaintiff, contended that the risk continued, and that the underwriters were liable. Mr. Colin Blackburn, who appeared for the defendants, was not called upon. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that the plaintiff could not succeed in the action. The ship had arrived In safety at its place of destination, though it had previously sustained a partial damnage. The other Judges were of the same opinion. Judgment for the defendants. INGLAND V. BLACR WELL. fr. MILWARD moved for a rule for a now trial in this ease. The question raised was whether the attesting witness to a of ale was roperly described as required by the Bill of Sales Act. The Act required that the attesting witness should be described by his " residence and occupation," and in the present instance he was described thus "WIm. Robt. Cuthbert, of King's Bench-walr, Temple, clerk to Messrs. Brandret aud Randall, of the place aforesaid, eolicitors." Thelearnedcounsel contended thatthe word " residence" meant where the party resided with his family mad where he passed the night. It was found in this case that, though the attesting witness passed the greater portion of his time in the Temple, he did not sleep there. The Court of Exchequer had taken time to consider the same point. Lord CAMPBELL said that, on ordinary occasions, on being informed that a co-ordinate Court had taken time to consider a question, this Court would not refuse a rule raising the same point. But in this case the Court had been assured that the Court of Exchequer would not consider it any disrespect if, after hearing the question argued, this Court should refuse the rule. His (Lord Campbell's) opinion was, that the rule ought to be refused, on the ground that the objection taken was unfonnded. In construing the Act the Court ought to look at the purpose the Legislature had in view, and how that was to be attained. In some cases the purpose of the Legislature could only be attained by construing the word " residence" as meaning the place where the party resided with his family, aud passed the night; but under the Common Law Procedure Act the words "place of abode" of an attorney had been construed to meanhis "place of business." His (Lord Campbell's) opinion was, that the object of this Act of Parliament was most efectually gained by holding that this descrip- I tion was sufficient, and that it was not necessary to state where the witness passed the night. The description of the witness as clerk of Messrs. Brandret and Randall, of King's Bench-walk, Temple, solicitors, would enable parties to identify him, and to gain information from him, more effecltually than if ho stated where he slept. The Act said a description of the " residence and occupation" of the attesting witneES should be given. His place of residence was where he was likely to be found, and that was at the office of his employers. If this objection were allowed the Bill of Sales Act would be nullified, and a statute passed to prevent fraud would be the occasion of fraud. The objection, therefore, failed, and the rule must be refused. Mr. JUSti;C COLERIDGB, Mr. Justioe WoIUTANY, and Mr. Justice ERLE; expressed themselves to the same effect. RLule refused. FRtOO. V. ASUDOWN AN-D OTIIERS. This was an action in which the plaintiff, Charles P. Eroom, an attorney, sued the defendant Ashdown and four others to recover the sum of 2001. under the count for money paid. The action was tried before Lord CampbeU at the sittings after last term, wben it appeared that the plaintiff and defendants were the promotere of a company incorporated on the 31st of October, 1856, to be called "The Hungerford-hall Dining Company, Limited." It was agreed that the promoters should pay the preliminary expenses, and it was proposed that they should take the Hungerford-hall for the purposes of the company. Theplaintiff's father-in-law had an interest in the bal, whichhe was Illing to dispose of for 2001, but, as there were no funds, a resolution was passed by the promoters on the 20th of October, 1856, to the effect " that the solicitor of "tbe company (the plaintiff) be requested to pay Mr. Murray the sum of 2041., and that he be reimbursed out of the frst moneys received at the company's bankers, and that in the rncantlime he hold the agreement as a collateral security." The money was accordingly paid by the plaintiff, and as the company, though incorporated on the 3ist of the same muonth, turned out abortive, the plaintiff brought this action, and sought to make the defendants personally liable. On the part of the defendalits it was proved that the plaintiff had assured them when they joined the undertaking that they would incur no personal responsibility beyond the amount of their shares, and the defendant Ashdown stated that at the meeting held on the 20th of October, when the plaintiff proposed that the 2001 should be got to pay Mr. Murray for his Interest in the Hungerford-kall, he (Ashdown) said he would not put his hand in his pocket for sixpenceif he was to be personally liabls. Upon that the resolution that the plaintiff should be requested to pay the money was passed, and the plaintiff expressed himself atisfied. It appeared that the sum of 3S1. had been paid into the hands of the hankers, but the directors had not paid any portion to the plaintlff: Upon this evidence Lord Campbell directed a verdict to be entered for the defendants, but gave the plaintiff leave to move the Court to enter the verdiot in his favour for 2001, or for the 381. to which the plaintiff contended he was at all events entitled. A rule having been accordingly granted, Mr. Serjeant HYXS, Mr. BEASLEY, and Mr. HARRISON now showed cause against the rule, and contended that the resolution upon the authority of which the plaintiff had paid the money clearly showed that the plaintiff looked to the funds of the company for repayment. Mhr. BD;rN JAmES, Q.C., and Mr. HAWES, in support of the rule, contended that the payment of the 2001 was one of the preliminary expenses which the defendants were bound to pay, and that the resoluton clearly showed that they had requested" the plaintiff to pay the money. If not personally liable for the 2001., the defendants were clearly liable for the 381. Lord CAhSPB:LL said he was of opinion that this action to recover 2001. as money paid could not be sapported as money paid at the request of the defendants. The plaintiff had told them they were not to be personally responsible, and one of them Wsid he would not put his hand in his pocket for 6d. if he was to be personally liable; and when the resolution was passed the plaintiff said he was contented 'with it. What was that but saying, " You shall not put rou handin your pocket for 6d., and I am contented to ok to the funds in the -hands of the bankers?" As to the 381. a different consideration arose, and If a "pecial action had been brought against the defendants upon an under- ftking to Eeeth the company's funds shbold bo applied to the particuar purpose be (Lord Campbell) was aot prepared to pay that such an action could not he supported. But tbis was an action for money paid, and as to the 381. thera was no personal undertaking by the defendants. All they lad said was, that when the money was received by the company's bankers it should be paid. The defendants were in thenatuae of sureties for the con,pany's doing what the company was bound to do. His Lordship said there was no doubt that the company was liable, for it had adopted the agreement and taklen advantage of it. The remedy both for the 2001. and the 381. was against the company, and not against the defendants. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, Mr. Justice WIGOTMA1, and Mr. Justice ERLE expressed themselves to the same effect. Mr. Justice EaLz expressed himself in very strong terms in condemnation of attorneys who, like the plaintiff, induced persons to join them in undertakings of this nature by the promise that they shonld incur no personal responsibilty, and then turned round upon them and brought actions against them. Rule discharged. BAIL COIURT. (Sitings at Niri Prius, at Westminstcr, before Mr. Justice CROMrTON.) The Court sat this morning, but only took undefended cauEes.
I CO URT Off COMMON PLEAS, WxST}IINSTMA, Nov. 20. (Sini7gs in Banco, Michaelms Term.) This was a special paper day. EGFRTON AND WIFE V. BRASSY. This waz a speoial case to try the right to some property under a will, the question raised being whether the real estate passed to the plaiatiff as contingent remainder-man, or to the defendant as assignee of the residuary legatee. Mir. Shapter and Mr. Bexvan, of the Chancery bar, appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. T. Williams for the defendant. The LORD CHiEF JUSvTIc, in delivering the judgment of the Court, said he was of opinion that in this case judgment must be for the defendant. The aotion was brought to try the right to some property whioh was devised by the will of Elizabeth Glover, who was seized in fee of the premises in question, and who devised them to her niece, E. Highfield, for life, and to the issue of that niece, with further remainder in default of such issue to her nephew, Peter Highfield. The will which contained these devises contained a residuay clause, whereby the testatrix gave and bequeathed " all the residae and remainder of her estate and effects not heretofore disposed of unto her said niece, E. Highfield." It appeared that after the death of the testa trix E. llighfield, by deed of release dated the 31st of October, 1832, conveyed the premises In fee to Petoe Jackson, under whom the defendant claimed, and the question now raised was whether the conveyanco in fee was good, or -whether, on the other hand, Peter High. field was entitled in contingent remainder to the estate, E. Highfield, the tenant for Iffe, having died without issue. The question was whether the life estate became merged In the reversion, so that when the life estate failed the contingent remainder was destroyed. He was of opinion that this was so. The testatrix had here created, fist a life estate, and then a contingent remainder, leaving, except so far as the residuary clause was concerned, the estate in fee undispoeed of. It 'was clear that that estate in fee not being dis. posed of, and remaining till the contiegent remainder should take effect, must have remained somewhere. It was not that mere imaginary and shadowy Interest which Mr. Shapter, who had argued this case most Ingeniously and ably for the plaintiff, would have them conceive. The estate in fee being somewhere, what became of it ? It would be in the heir at law, unleos it were disposed of by this will. But they found that the testatrix purported to dispose of all the residue and remainder of her estate whatever and wheresover, and therefore of the estate in fee, which did not pass by the mere creation of the estate in contingent remainder. Then the estate in fee would appear to be included in the residuary bequest of all the estate of the testatrix " whatsoever and wheresoever" not previously disposed of. The only difficulty that could be said to exist wag, that an estate of this kind must have been made the subject of specific bequest and dld not pass; but no authority had been quoted for that position. Primd face, according to first principles, if an estate still remained in a testator undisposed of, and he then by a residuary clause disposed of all his residuary estate, it would follow that the estate not previously disposed of would pass under that residuary devise, There was no authority to the contrary ; but, on the contrazy to that, it was takea for granted by learned text writers that such an estate, if given, would pass under the residuary clause. He was of opinion that this was the case; that the estate would have passed to the heir-at-law of the testatrix unless she had disposed of it, and that she had disposed of it under the resinary olause. That being so, the tenant for life, E. gbghfield, became possessed of the two estates-the estate for life and the reversion ia fee, and she having oonveyed both to Peter Highfield, there 'was an end of the contingent remainder, which was to support the estate for life. The other learned Judges concarred. Judgment for the defendant. FIY V. HARDING, P. 0. This wasa special case the question raised in which was whether a person named Russell was liable, as an existing shareholder of the Royal British Bank, to the plaintiff as an execution. creditor on a judgment obtained against the defendant as the publio officer of the bank. Mr. Beasley appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Milward for the defendant RusselL The question turned on the construction of tho 21st section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 113. It appeared that Russell had sold his shares, and the name of the person to whom he had sold them was registered as the proprietor of the shares In the bank books. It was the duty of the] directors to insert the names of their shareholders from time to time in a memorial, and by the 21st section of the sta. tute referred to "the persons whose names shall appear from time to time in the then last delivered memorial and their legal representatives shall be liable to all legal pro. ceedings under this Act." Although the name of the purchaser of the shares had been registered in the books of the company, the directors had not taken Mr. Russell's name off the memorial, and when the bank Eailed the judgment obtained against the public officer at the suit of the plaintiff, a creditor of the bank, was revived against Mr. Russell by scire facis, as a shareholder of the bank whose name appeared on the mnemorial. It 'was now submitted for the plaintiff that he was entitled to recover against Russell notwithstandlng the fact of the sale of the shares, as a person wrho by law he had a right to treat as a debtor, andthat Russell had his remedy over against the directors for their neglect in not taking his name off the m.emorial. For the defendant Russell it was contended that, under the 14th section, the general intention of the Act of Parliament was that no person should be liable as a shareholder who had parted with his shares any more than an ordinary partner would be if that Act had not passed ; and that an ordinary partner under such circumstances would not be liable. The case of " Powys v. Butler," which stands for argument, raised a similar point; and The LORD CHsnx JuSTICE said they would hear the other case argued before thoy gave judgment.

COURT OF BXCHEBouR. FR1DAY. NTov. 20 N1V TRIAL PAIIER. RIUDSON V. BAXXNDALE. (Siting in Banco.) i hIs Was a rule for a new trial on the ground of the improper rejection of evidence tendered by the plaintiff, and of the misdirection of the jury on the part of the Chief Baron, by whom the cause was tried at the Guildhall sittings after Trinity term, when a verdict passed for the defendant. The action was brought against Messrs. Piokford, the well-known carriers, to recover 131. 10., the value of 25 gallons of gin, on the ground that that quantity had either leaked out or had been stolen from a puncheon of gin which bad been delivered to the defendants by the plaintiff in London, so far back as 1854, to be carried to Brecon. It appeaxed that on the arrival of the cask at Glocester it was. handed over to the Moderator Boat Company to be forwarded to Brecon, and that it was then found to be leaky. When it was tendered to the consignee he refused to receive it on the ground that the contents were far in excess of the order to the traveller, and the cask was taken back to a warehouse, where it remained till it wasfound bung down, and wasgauged by the traveUer and the consignee and foond to have lost 25 gallons. The plaintiff made several fruitless applications for compensation to the defendants, who stated that they had nothing to do with the loss, as they had handed over the cask at I Glocester " in good condition." and ultimately this action was brought. At the trial it was con tended by the plaintiff that, under such circumstances, it was the duty of the defendants as carriers for hire to give notice to him, as the consignee, of the rejection of the eask so that steps might have been taken to recover and protect it, and evidence was offered of the custom of carriers to give such notice. The learned judge rejected this evidence, and told the jury that the defendants as carriers were bound to take care of the cask as long as the transit lasted, but when that ended, and the consignee refused to accept it, they were only bound to do awhat was proper and reasonable, and that if the jury thought it was prop^r and reasonable to give the notice insisted on by the plaintiff, then he should hold that such notice ought to have been given. The juryfound averdictforthe defendant, whereupon this rule was obtained early in the present term. Mr. WiTDE and Mr. C. POLLOCK yesterday and to-day showed cause, contending that the evidence was properly rejected, and that the law cast no such obligation on carriers as that which the plaintiff sought to impose on them. Mr. J. BROWN- and Mr. HOLT were heardfin support of their rule, and at the conclusion of their argument, The COURT, without hesitation, gave judgment, dischargng the rule on all points, it being the clear opinion of thelr Lerdships that the evidence in qeestion had been properly rejected, and that there was no such obligaion cast by law on a eurier as that contended for the plaintiff under the circumstances of the case. Rule discharged. DAVIS V. UINDERWOOD. This was a rule to inorease the damages from a nominal sum of Is. to 401. The action was by a landlord against a tenant for non-repair. Mr. Overend and Mx. Dowdeswell appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Petersdorff was not called upon to support bis rule, The COURT being of opinion that, as the plaintiff was liable to make good the premises to his superior landlord he waS entitled to recover.from his tenant, the defendant, by whom the premises had been allowed to fail out of repair, the snm which it would cost to put them into a state to comply with the terms of the lease. Rule absolute. (S&tings at Kie Priuu. before Mar. Baron MARTIN and 'Ilhis was an action brought to recover a sum ot 2601, money aUeged to have been received by the defendant for the use of the plainti; The defendant pleaded never Indebted. Mr. Xnowles and Mr. Field appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Serjeant Kinglake and Mr. Hodges were counsel for the defendant. It appeared that a person named Ralph was indebted to the plaintiff; a rag merchant and stationer at Bristol, in the sum of 2001., and to secure that'sum a bill of sale had been given to the plaintiff. In consequence of Ralph having lost an action the plaintiffl employed the defeadant, vwho was an auctioneer, to seU the goods under the bill of sale, upon the understanding that the plaintff should give him an indemnity against any action Rhich might be brought against him on account of the sale. The goods reallzed upwards of 2501,, which was paid into the defendant's hands, and he then refused to hand the money to the plaintifTf unless he could find a person to becore a surety for the performance of the indemnity. The plaintiff had offered his bond for 40014, but that had been refused Under these circumstances, he had brought the present action. The plaintiff and his attorney were called in support of this view of the case. The defence was that the defendant had refused to sell the goods unless the plaintiff would find sureties for his performance of the indemnity. The plaintiff had given his word to fnd them, and then, wvhen the goods had teen sold, he had refused the performance of his promise. The defendant had acowrdingly refused to part with the money. The counsel having addremsed the juryon behalf of their respective clients, Mr. Baron MARTIN, in summing up, said that he could not conceive what danger the defendant incurred by paying over the money to the plaintiff. There were only two creditors who had any claim against Ralph, one of them being the attorney who prepared the bil of sale for his cost, and another being an attorney who had seized his person. Neither of these persons could have any claim upon the property held by the defendant, although he had no doubt that the defendant had refused to pay the money from a proper, although a mistaken motive. The question for the wuv was whether the bond tendered by the plaintiff was a full and s9icient indemnity to the defendant. No one pretended that the plaintiff was not a solvent man, and the defendant ' roper course should have been to make in. quiries about the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 2131. 17s.
COUBT OF BA1KRUPTUT, Bih4gdmu, 'ov. 20. __ LY RIZ TIHE RMMOPOLITAN BREAD COIPANY. (Beforee Mr. Commissioner Fo LAxouAl -'us was A meeting unider a winding-up order obtained under the Joint-Stock Companies Act, 1856, to settle the lis of contributories of this company. Mr. W.LIewis(Wilmin tn.square) appeared fororeditors; and Mr. Lawrance and r.-Armasirong for alleged contribu. tories. The cas gave rise to a protracted discussion, mand resultedain a judgmaent of great importance to creditors of companies formned on the principle of limited liability. It was agreed that the "Memorandum of Association,'setting forth the names of at le-ast six persona desirous to obtain. shares in the proposed company and the number anid value of such shame, was decisve as to their liability to the amouant therein set forth; but it was held that the words of the 19th saein of the Act, viz.,-"That no person shall be deemed a contributor whose name does not appear on the register of shareholders," relieved all other shareholders, whatever other evidence miight be given of their being such. In tbls case the company had obtained a cartili. cate of registration), which authorized it to issue sharTes, and one of the requirements of the Limited Liability Act is, that a compay shall keep ak register of its shareholders Here only a list of the shareholders ha been miade inL a hook by the secretary, under the directions of the managing director. There was not affixed eithzer the signature of a shareholder or the company's seal. The Comnmissioner held that this could not be considered a register within the meaning of the Act. Ha further held that the 19th section must be strictly construed. It was urged that if this was the law in respect to limited liability companies, It was only for shareholders to fal to keep a registr, and creditors were withoutanylegalremedywhatever.Th.ey ould not sue individual shareholders. Thatwas on allhands agreed. Their only remedy was by obtaining a winding-up order against the company. That obtained, this failure to keep a register exonerated shareholders. The Commissioner pointed out that the sabqeholders might be either proceeded against criminally for having failed to perform one of the conditions of incorporation, or that an action at common law maight he sastained against individuals as if the comapany was not formed under the Limited Liability Act. To this It was replied that the certificate of incorporation, as actually received, and the register, such as it was, as actually kept, but which the Court held to be no register at all, would be a good aefence The shareholders, it -was frtLher urged, could net at the present stage of proceedings take advantage of their own wrong in keeping an imperfect or Illegal registers contrary to the statuite.

INSOLVENT DIEBTO COUBT, Nov. 20. IN RE MARY ANI CRH1ISTTi. (Before Mr. Commiwoner ?nmLarsA In this case the Court has been engaged for several days uapon an inquiry into certaln complaints made respecting the conduct of an attorney. The insolvent, a millinerand dressmaker at the West-end, was in difculties, and according to her testimony and that of her partner, Miss Honore, she was induced after much pressure to allow herself to be arrested at the suit of one Mr. Levison for an alleged debt of 231. The nctive party in promoting this arrangement was Mrs. Levison, who had dealt with the in. solvent for soiled goods. She introduced Miss Christian to an attorney, Mr. JoEeph Olive, of Portsmouth-street, I4ncoIn's-inn-fields, who issued a writ at the suit of Mr. Levison, to which the insolvent gave a judgment consent the following day, and she was immediately arrested and committed to Whiteorossstkaet Prison. Mr. Olive, as her attorney, then filed a petition to this Court, and prepared a schedule, which contained the names of certain persons In India,Australia,and other distAntplaces alleged to bedebto:s to the estate, but who were non-existent personages suggested by Mrsm Levison, who recommended that the reJ debtors should not appear on the schedule, but that fictitious names should be set out in order to account for the property recelved. Miss Christian stated that upon reading over the schedule, and finding that she would be required to swear as to its truth, she informed Mr. Olive that she could not do Eo as the real debtors were omitted and false names introduced, and also that neither she nor her partner owed Mir. or Mrs. Levison one farthing. In the meantime notices for a discharge upon bail were given, but when the day appointed for that purpese arrived Mr. Lewis, ot the firm of Lewis and Lewis, to whom the insolvent had resorted for advice, appeared,and made the complaint respecting Ur. Olive, into which the Court has been for several days inquiring. It appeared that the evening before the day fixed for the final hearing one of Mr. Olive's clerks, named Wheatwroft, wrote to each of the proposed sureties informing them Mtbht Miss Christian intended to quit the country as soon as she 'was liberated. Miss Christian swore that she never had any such Idea nor had ever expressed any such intention, while Wheatoroft said he received the information from Mrs. Levison. Mr. Olive admitted that he was aware oftthe letters being written by his clerk soon after they were sent, but he did not reprove him for writing them, although perhaps It was an error in judgment. He had received 1ll. from the insolvent, and had lent 31. of it to MIrs. Levison without taling any acknowledgment. Another episode in the case was the mode of procuring bail. The insolvent paid 5l. for that Vurpose, and a Mr. Marshall procured two sureties, each of wnem received, according to hr. Olive's statement, 11. lOs., and Mr. Olive himself 11. 5s. out of the 51. The case had been adjourned on two occadons for the attendance of mr. andM Levison, but neither were forthcoming It being stated that they were in the country. Upon wednesday last a discharge from Mr. Levison's auit was sent to the prison, but Miss Christian being detained at the suit of a bond fde creditor still remains in castody. The learned COMmSSIONER said, it was most importamA for Mr. Olive's own interest that be sbould produce Mr. and Mrs. L.evison, and the case would be adjourned until Tuesday to afford him another opportunity. If, however, upon that day the witnesses were not forthcomingP he (MIr Commissioner Phillips) should consult with the other Coinnisioners upon the nropriety of remoinng Mr. Olive from the list of practitioners in that Court. (Before Mmr. Comminsioner MURPHY.) IN RE REUBEN MICHAEL. This insolvent, who aaid he was in no business or occupation, applied to be discharged. He had already taken the benefit of the Act on four previous occasions In 1840, 1842, 1849, 1855, and had also been once a bankrupt. His wife possessed a separate income of 8001. a-year, but the insolvent attributed 'his present difficulties to " pettifogging lawyers, hill discounters, and young ladies." Mr. R-eed opposed for three creditors, and Mr. Sargood supported. The learned CosemsxsoNxER thought that the insolvent was fully deservingof the application of the utmost discretionary powers of the Court, and therefore, unless he chosetoarrange with his detainingcreditor, he must expect toremain in prison for a space of six months from the date of the vesting order,

POLICE. MArO!-OU sxE.-Iary Ann Sheay, alias Mapbern, a girl 13 years of age, who had been remanded upon the charge O steling lOlb. of old iron and carpenters' chisels, woith 2s. 6d.,fron some premises in the course of erection in Mitre-oourt, Cheapeidea was again brought before the RD MAYOR and Mr. Aderman 1 in petty Eessions. At the last examination the prisone, after the charge had been proved against her, confessed her guilt and begged hard to be allowed to go home, declaring it wsa her firat offence Thisaseto,owerwacordcedb Polce-constable William Mortjs, No 419 whostated tha4 be had known the prisoner for a long time and that she was the constant asmociate of juvenile thieves, a number of whom were waiting outside the court t learn the result of the charge. Thgilsd she wasthdagtro mn Osthole pharens t lhat fora long tim e p he had been sent out to beg, and to take to her parents whatever money she received. The LoRD MAYon, finding that the girl had been brought up in the Roman Catholio faith, directed Mr. Goodman, the chie clerk, to communicate with the authorities of the Catholio lBeformatorY School at Beauchamp-lodge, manmersmith, and a gentleman from that institution Wuas re sent durin the proceedings at the M.anson-honse yesterday Daniel gabern, the father of the girl, who had been served with a second summons, after having refused to attend to the first, was called Into the witness-box, and in reply to the LORD M&YOR said he w a Roman Catholic and wished his daughter to go into some reformatory insti tution. The Girl (crying bitterly).-Oh, father, pray, pray don't send me there; pray don't, pray don't. The LORD MkYOn.-Magabern, I understand you are in the habit of writing letters for people inL distress. Magabern.-No, I do not, indeed; I work hard for my li ,. I have this year been haymaking, harvesting, and 'Re LORD LYoR-I have been snaking inquiries about yOu, and find that you have been in the Dublin police. Magabern.-That's true. The LORD MAYORL-YoU have also been in the Excise ? Magabern.-Yes. The LORD 3AYOt.-Two years ago you were in the Glasgow police ? Magabern.-Yes; and I work at the docks sometimes now. I have two boys and four girls, the eldest of wrhom is 16. A policeman, named M'Kenzle said, he had known Magabern, his wife, and children, for 10 years. They lived by begging. The LORD MAYOR.-Magabern, your wife, I am told, refuses to come here, hecanse you have given her a black eye. Magbern.-I did not dolit; she fell against the window shutter. The LOm MAYoR, addressing the girl, said-You may think the sentence I am about to pass upon you a very severe one, but I am convinced you will hereafter know I am doing an act of the greatest possible kindness to a little girl in your unfortunate position. I am about to remove you from the custody of very bad parents, who have had it in their power properly toprovide for you and bringyon up, and who ave not only neglected to, do so, but have actually lived upon Your success in begging and stealinT. You will now be rescued from thepath of viceandwretchedness,andzundergo a training which will make you a useful member of societv. Parents are perhaps not aware that they are liable for the maintenance of their childrea during the time they are detained in areformatory esablishment, and may beimprisoned for non-payment. I am determined to free the city of tho large number of deatitut chlldren who arain the habit of collecting principally in the vicinity of tho Royal Exchange. I hope the sentence I am about to pass will have the effect of lessening the number oS destitute children who are sentinto the streets to beg, and whose parents spend in idleness and ,ro1igacy the money they are fortunate enough to obtain. he Bhoeblack Society has now become, as it were, a fixed trade, and I hops that the efforts of the Streetsweepers' Society will be equally successfuL AUl the pence given to theseLads are apropriated towards their maintenance and itatructlon; and as soon as the public are aware of this fact I am sure they will generously aid these poor boys as far as they can. Mary Ann Magabern, it Is the opinion of my brother magistrate and myself that you should be imprisoned for 14 days in the House of Correction at Holloway; and that at the expiration of that time you should be sent to the Catholic Reformatory School at Hammersmith for three years. Imusediatelythe sentence was pronounced the girl, who throughout the proceedings asemed overwhelmed with grief, and earndatly implored her father to take her home with him,tfell upon her knees, and, firmly grasping the rails in front of the dock, shrieked and screamed most violently. She was carried out of court in a fainting state. A more painful scene has seldom been witnessed in a courtof justice. Magabern (coolly).-You have done the very best thing you could, my Lord. The LORD MAYoiz-If you had not been a worthless, Idle fellow, there would have been no necessity for my sending her to this inatitution. I have no doubt that when she leaves It she will be able to get into respectable service, and be comfortably situated. GUiLD A TAnT.-Mm Eliza Perkins, alias Williams, alias Elmhley, who was remanded from Thursday upon a charge of imposing upon hotel and boarding-house proprietors, was agai brought up, when the porter at Ridley's Hotel attended and said the prisoner applied for accommodation on the afternoon of the 9th inst., and on being informed she could not be received she asked where there was a respectable hotelnear, and the porter named several, including the Black Bull in Holborn. The ATxsPsA, upon hearing this, decided that the portes's evidence had upset the charge of false pretence, and unless there was any other complaint she must be discharged. The prLsoner was accordingly liberated. Bow-ST'RnT.-The summons against the six booksellers in EIolywelistreet, on whose premises seizures of obscene hooks, prints, &c., were made on Friday of last week, having been made returnable at 3 o'clock yesterday, the police attended at that hour and produced the property Mfr. Bodldn again appeared for the Home-office, Mr. Orridge attended as counsel for one of the defendants, and Mr. Lewis, jun., as solicitor for another. Mary Elliott, of 14, Holywell-street, was first called. She at once came forward and expressed great anxiety to contradict a statement mad.e at the Last examination, that she was the same person who, on the occasion of the former seizare, wrote a penitential latter to the Home-office, promising not to offend again, She also alleged that some of th e books now seized had been returned as unobjection^able on tho former occasion, Lnspector Lester said, this was not the case. At the former seizure the books, &c., were al of an objectionable character, and none were returned. In thls case one book and a few prints were returned. The zenmainder were ordered to be retained for seven days, wihen they will be destroyed, unless in the case of an appeal, or of any further proceedings on the part of Government. A person who represented himself to be a solicitor's clerk appeared for the next defendant, Edward aMorris, of 25, Wych-street, but, as he produced no written authority from the solicitor in whose name he attended, Mr. JAJWINE refused to hear him. Defendant did not answer to his name. Two pictures in frames and one book were ordered to be returned. Several copies of a book called A-ristotl were condemned and ordered to be detained as in the former case. In the next case the person summoned was Thomas Blackll, of 16, Holywell-street, in whose stead appeared an old man named Dngdale, who stated that he was the owner and occupier of the house. In order to attend he had been brought up on a hiaeas from Coldbath-fields Prison, where he is at present undergoing a sentence of two years, imprisonment for selling obscene publications. Ho attempted to dispute the proceedings from the beginning, alleging that the seizure was ilegal, and, when overruled on this point, demandig to go over the works seriatim. After much time had been wtasted in listeniing to his somewhat violent declamation, Mr. XARDsE disposed of the case by condemning two large parcels of books, &c., and ordering a comparatively small quantity to be returned. Mr. Lewis appeared for the next defendant, WiUiam Wynn, and contended that the At istotle, of which 14 copies had been seized, was a medical work, and not obscene, Mr. JxRDLNx was of a contrary opinion. The title page alone was enough to condemn the book. A quantity of books, pamphlets, &a. were condemned, and a small portion of books, &c., and some stereotype plates of Fozes Book of fMartyrs, were returned. Mr. Ozridge appeared for the next defendant, Richard Wynn, vho, he observed, was not an habitual dealer in these works, which had been suffered to creep in among his stock by inadvertence. Mr. JARDINE said these observations were no answer to the charge, but might possibly be taken into account by the authorities in considering the propriety of instituting further proceedings. In this case only a smal quantity of books was condemned, and the remainder returned. In the next case the person summoned was John Thornhill, but Dngdale again appeared, and stated that the premises were his. Ho took the same course as in the former case, insisting upon each of the condemned books being shown to him, and asking the magistrate to point out the objectionable portions, which, of course, his worship refused to do. As,however, he failed to sho c--ase against tue destruction of the copies the order was made ec. as in the other cases. MAARLBOROUGH STREET.-Thonas Flaydon was charged with stealing a quantity of jewelrv and other articles from the shop of his employer, Mr. Richard Waylett, 233, Oxford-street. Mr. Waylett said, the prisoner entered his service about six years ago, and was discharged about 13 muouths back. About a month afterthe prisoner had left bim be missed a variety of articles, among them a sngar basin and cream oag, now in the hands of the police. The property missedexceeded 201. in value. Police-sergeant Sedgewick, of the West Riding of Yorkshir constabulary, said, on the Ist of Ulay he apprehended the prisoner for robbing his master, Mr. Cooper, of Huddersfield. On searching the prisoner's house he found a quantity of duplicates relating to property stolen from his ormer master, Mr. Waylett. He also ftned a sugar basin, cream jug, 12 forks, six knives, and other articles, aU of which were identified by Mr. Waylett, who had been communicated with as soon as the property was foaud. The prlsoner was sentenced to six months' itnprisonment for robbing Mr. Cooper, and after the expiration of the sentencewitnesstookhim into custody and brought him to London. ThomasSmith,assistantto Mr. Msill, pawnbroker, pDr.- duced six silver spoons pledged on the 15th of Novenmbar, 1856; and William Powell, rpper Park-place, prodaced a tablespoon and six forks pledged last December and William Bezant, assistant to Mr. Brooks, 30, OrciAard-street, produced a quantity of spoons and other articles pledged at various times. All the property produced was identified by 3hr. Waylett. The prioner reoerved his defence, and was ful]y commuted. KAIaBOXB.-lIr. LOSG has roeeived from " J. G. F." A check for two g4ineas for the pcor-box of the court. W ESTMIN sm h°e.-rioAltoLD, the presiding maglistrate, was oocupied somne hours ia hearing a charge of libel pre. ferred by Mr. Benjamin Coleman, a merchant in the Poultry, agaizist Mr. Edwin Ward Jakson, of 14, Cravenhill-gardens, Ba-vswater, a county magistrate. hr. Tindal Atkinson, ia opening his case, adverted to there having been a recent comnplaint against the defendlant for libel at the Mansion-bouce, which had failed for want of legal proof. Tihe present prosecutio,n was for tnlawfully and maliciously publishing a certain defamatory libel against Mr. Coleman, addressed to Mr. Williat Dred 19, Great George-street, within the district of this court. U. first proposed to show the anintus which existed in this cwe and whlch lwas attributable to the defendant owing his client a large sum of money; and he would then call witnesses to prove that the letter containing the libel was in the handwritin; of the defendant. It had the effect of creating a prejudice in the mind of the gentleman to whom it was addressed, Who had had some transactions with the oomplainant, and a more atrocious, unfounded, unwarrantable, or cowardly attack had never been made unon the reputation of a gentleman whose character had never been impeached.He then read the following letter:- Bir,-Thare is a deep-dyed coundral about town who has trled various dodges forthe purpe of extortlngmoney. liupractiuce to scrao giqualtance With gentemen, as with IDsulef and otheri, and get to o.rw their hitory, an then,b ,trumped up tales, siutated reports, and perverted statements, to tbhten to expsoe them.

Mr. Tindal Atkinson added that, the facts of the case at the Mansion-house having come before the Hublic, Mr Dredge, with very gentlemanly feeling, placed :mneIlf ,n communication with lar. Coleman, from whom he had withdrawn his confidence, and the present proceedings were resorted to. Mr. W. Dredge, engineer, Great George-street, proved the receipt of the letter above given about the 15th of October. He had previously had some business traneac. tions with Mr. Coleman, and in consequence of the letter withdrew some papers which Mfr. Coleman had in his pos. session. In reply to an inquiry from Mr. Serjeant Parry, witness said he was not personally acquainted with Mr. Jackson, and shoald not have known him If he had met him. Mr. Benjamin Coleman said he had known the defendant since 1845,and hadhad transactions with him since. In the course of business there was corr,spondence between them. After 18I4 or 184 he had no communicastlon with defendant, till 1855, when some communication took place between them agatn. He knew defendant's handwricing, and had not a doubt that he wrote the libel produced. Mr. Parry, having doclared that in his information upon which proceedings were taken in the case at the Mansionhouse, and his subsequent evidence on the other case, witness had differod as to the handwriting onjthe envelope, putin the following respecting monetary transactions be tween the parties:- - We have this lOth day of September, 1SS6. been pDid by and re eeStedrrom EdwinWard J&ckSon.

I CoLZAIA mAD TODD." "Witne-, John StamperY. Witness admitted the validity of the above, bat begged to explain. There was a balance of 1,200& due from defendant to witness and his partner, arising out of transactions when they were in business at Liverpool, and defendlant was posted as a defaulter, In abont 12 months afterwards defendant came to him in the guise of a pauper, with his coat broken under the arm, and begged him In the humblest manner to forget the past, to accept 2001. in liquidation of the 1,2001.. that his name as a defaulter might be removed from the Stock-Exchange, with an assurance that when his prospects brightened he would act honoarably towards the firm in the transaction. In 1855 witness agaim met him in London, when he said he would pledge his coat to redeem his honour ia past transactions, and proposed further business. Witness here went into details of busdness between them, which resulted in cross actions for their respective claims and defendant having to pay witness 1601. andcosts. Five gentlemen werecalled who deposed to the bost of their belief that the libel was in the handwriting of the defendant. Mr. Parry said that hisclient, through him, denied in the most emphatic terms that he had written or sent the letter in question. The learned barrister, in defence, then went on to describe the present proceeding as part of a deeply lad scheme to extort money from his client by the threat of exposure of some circuxmstances wbich had occurred in the earlier period of his life, and the letter as a fabrication for the purpose of carying on the endeavour7with effect. His client, hedeclared, had claim againstthe complainant of 901.7 at the time of the set,tlement in 1846, and also had a superior claim to the complainant's on the last occasion, but, in an; illl-idged moment, paid 150v4 before the trial. Mr. Pary then read a number of let;ters from complainant to defendant, paages of which he charcoterized as part of Ithe scheme he describoed. The first of these letters, dated August 29, 1857, said,- "M4 present object In writing toD SOU i to again give you the uopprtunity ot meetine me, if you please, for tbO Uprpa6ae of handing toteouldocuments In my poson relative to our recent trns gwions,nd of coaln g to atn explduti understandang with oou as t0 my future courae ot acion. If eon declie tr remet ume I shalloonider rmel eltrerlre relieved froml the silence I bave-observed in the hope of an arrangement In the characte3r and conduct of your tbacations wth roe." After giving the ntames of the bench of magistrates, the letter went on- I certain4y wilt never allow yen to hold up your head among those gentlemen so lng as your mnoral ublIgallons to me remain unadjusted.,, In a letter written by compldnant to Mr. Jervis, defendant's solicitor, bearing date September 4, he says- " r. Jackson's transactions with ro In 1l46 were of such a character as to obUgh bim to leave Liverpool aid to forfeit the friendship of his leadling acquantances there. I paid for JackEon under mott vexatious circumstance. £1,200. 8omo montha after dresed up for the occsoion, on the faseplea of poverty, and sobbhgMmke achild,htinduced ine to consent to take LDOSforxthis debt, ith asolemn promise that it be were ever in a po3itton to do so he would pay the wbe:e." Another letter accused defendant of having " failed to redeem the promises he had so frequently made to him," and threatened to " lay before Sir G. Grey the nature of his conduct and transactions with complainant, and also forward a copy of the communication to the chairman of the Bench of Middlesex Magistrates." The letter concluded by offering to refer the matter t the arbitration of any man of standing. Five or six genlemen, including M1r. Jervis, were put into the wFitness-box, and swore to the very best of their belief the libel wasnot in defendant's handwriting. Some thought there was a little similarity, others were positive there was none. Mr. ARXoLD observed that the case appeared by consent to have been referred to him for triaL If Mr. Atkinson wished It, he would take the alleged libel and two other letters, admitted by aU to be in the handwriting of defendant, home and examine them,- but he would put it to Mr. Atkinson whether, in a case o0 belief like the present, aay jury would come to the conclusion that defendant was the writer of the letter? Mr. Atkinsonsaid he conld produce overwhelming evidencetbat it was defendant's writing. Mr. Parry retorted by declaring he could produce a host more witnesses to prove it was not. Some other remarks were made by the learned gentlemen, during which Mr. ARNOLD Eaid he was satisfied a jury would not convict. There was not afticient to justify him in sending the matter before another tribunal, and the case was therefore dismissed. CLmRwxuELL.-Ebenezer Hlargrave, a-ed 24, a respectably-dressed young man, who refused to give his address, and said he was of no occupation, was placed at the bar before Mr. TYRVHtIrT, charged with stealing from the erson of Mr. Walter Aske, residing at 18, Queen-street, tSerkenweli, a silver watch of the value of 21. The prisoner, who said he was respectably connected, and therefore refused his address, ba~t who it was stated had been before convicted, walked behind the prosecutor and his wife in St. John-street about 2 o'clock, and when near the corner of Spencer-street, in company with soene other men, attacked the prosecutor and his wife, knocked them both down, and then, cutting the watch chain, took away the watoh aad ran away. Mr. Aske called out "Stop thief!" when the prisoner was stopped by Police-constable Fry, 93 G, and when taking him into custody the prisoner dropped the watch, which was picked up by a paer-by and given to the police. Both the prosecator and his wife were hurt by the violence which was used towards thenm The prisoner, who denied the charge, was committed for trial.

Stack, pool, commanding the dep6t of the 18th Royal Irish, attached to the 3d battalion, directing him to hold in readl. ness the companies of that depOt to proceed from St. Mary's Barracks as soon as a station can be found to accommodate them. The depot cormpanies consist of seven officers and about 500 men of all ranks. Accunts have been received of the arrival of the Liverpool troopship at Rio Janeiro, all well, on the 20th of September, after experiencing some rather had weather. The Brilliant, 20, Captain J. A. Paynter, at Chatham, has been stripped, and the whole of her internal fittings and stores removed. She will be paid off this day, when her officers and crew will be granted leave, previously to joining the Racoon, 22, steam corvette. The Cadmus. 21, screw corvette, at Chatham, is ordered to be brought forward for commisdon. The Heron, 12, sloop, Commander W. H. Truscott, for the coast o! Africa, is ready for Eea, and is awaiting her sailing orders from the Admiralty. She is expected to leave Chatham on the 26th. The court-martial which sat on board the St. Vincent in Portsmouth harbour, on Thursday, to try Lieutenant Bradshaw, of the Juno, on the chargo published in Thte imes of that day, did not conclude its sitting until very late; the charge was declared partly proved, and the prisoner sentenced to be severely reprimanded. He was ably assisted by Mr. James Hosldns, solicitor, of Gosport, ex deputy judge-advocate of the fleet. The same court proceeded yesterday to try Mr. Drew, lAte acting master of the Juno, on the two charges published on Thursday. Mr. Hoskins also assisted this officer.

The new screw-steam line-of-battle ship Renown, of 91 guns, at Sheerness, is to be immediately commissioned Her complement ordered is 860 officers and men. The new screw steam line-of-battle ship Meeanee, of 80 guns, now in the fitting basi at Sheerness, is being also prepared for commission. The screw steam line-of-battle ship Cressy, of 80 guns, has been taken into No. 2 Dry Dock at Sheerness, to be brought forward for immediate service. * The Royal George, 102, screw steamship, at Sheerness, has been taken into No. 3 Dry Dock, and is now being rigged by the seamen of the Formidable and Edinburgh, ander the superintendence of the master-attendant of the yard.

He was likewise sentenced to be Imprisoned in Fort Clarence for two years. Tho hardened deportment displayed by the prisoner during the Infliction of the punishment is scaroely conceivable. *Her Majesty's troopship Rhadamanthus, Master-Com. mander Sturdee, is ordered to be paid off on her return to Woolwich from Portsmouth, after which she Is to befitted out and recommissioned with a complement of 69 hauds. * The following appointments have been made at the Ad3niralty:- Captain Arthur Forbes, to the Renown, commissioned; Commander dl.

DISGnACEFUJL SCBEN AT A FUNBRAL.-On Wed- nesday evening a very disgraceful affair ocourred at Lewes on the occasion of the interment of Miss Scobell (a daughter of the Rev. John Scobell, the rector of All Saints), who had for eome months previous to her death been living at SackviUle College, East Grinstead, where she died. The remains of the young lady were brought from the college to the Lewes station by train about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening, accompanied by the chief warden of the college (the Rev. Mr. Neale) and seven or eig ht of the ladles of -the sisterhood. When the coffin, which was a very ele1 gaut one, covered with a large pall, having a Gross uponi it, was taken out of the train, a number of the ian habitants of the town collected and followed the procession to All Saints' Church, the rector and his family having joined as it passed Lansdowne-terrace. The church was crowded, and the burial service wvas read by the Rev. Mr. Rutcheson, of Firle. The procession then msoved round the church to Mr. Soobell's family vault. At the close of the service one of the sisters attempted to place a garland upon the coffin, and Mr. N eale was about to commnenco to read some other service, when Mr. Hutcheson objected, and said it would not be allowed. Mr. Scobell also said he did not wish to have any service performed over the remains of his daughter except that prescribed by the church, and expressed his hope that the inhabitants would protect him and his family from molestation -while in the vault. Mr. Neale persisted in performing his service, when somo one in the crowd called out, "No Popery." This was followed by another cry of "Turn him out." Almost instantly the crowd rushed upon the rev. gentleman and the sisters, whom they expelled with violence from the churchyard. They were then pursued through the streets by the mob, who tore the garments of both the women and the priest. For some minutes they could find no place of refuge, but at length succeeded in getting into the King's Read Inn, Southover. The mob remained in front of the inn, yelling and shouting " No Popery," while the priest and the sisters were secreted in a s= of great fear, He eventually succeeded In escaping, without his coat, through a. field, to the railway station, and a body of police, under Superintendent Jenner, having Arrived, ith siters were conveyed to the railway station in a fly,, which was followed thither by as mob of 500 or 600 persons, who cazntLnued yelling and shouting "No Popery I" At the station the party remained in comparative sa1ety till 901,4to. tg a w'"91ck]! wffie t1As7 deygtd fg9 gai CArin,
DR. LIVINGSTO0'S DISCOTVERIas.* The volame before Us contains the results of nol less than 16 years' residence and travel in the in-I terior of Southern Africa; although the great feat of | the author-the traversing the entire continent-, from Loanda on the West, to Quilimane on the Eastern coaat-was reserved for the three last of them. Dr. Livingston originally embarked for Africa as early as 1840, under the auspices of the London Missionary Society. A genuine simplicity of mind, which peeps out continually in the course of his narrative, has induced him to prefix a few pages of introduction, containing the history of his previous life. Like many other men of mark, he is almost self-educated. He was put into a cotton factory as a " Diecer " at the age of 10, and with part of his first week's wages purchased Ruddiman's Budiments of Latin. Although engaged in his work from 6 o'clock in the morning till 8 at night, the thirst for knowledge induced him to attend an evening school for two hours more. This seems not to have been at all an iuncommon case at the factory; and the circumstance is an encouraging one for those -who hold that the exigencies of our manufacturing system do not preclude a high degree of mental culture in the artsan. The fact is that when an occupation is purely mechanical the mind of the labourer may occupy itself with much that is entirely foreign to the operation in hand without any detriment to the latter. Dr. Livingston used to place his book on a portion of the spinning-jenny, so that he eould catch sentence after sentence as he passed at his work. "Thus," says he, "1I kept up a pretty constant seady undisturbed by the roar of the machinery, and to this part of my edxca on I owe my present power of completely abstracting the mind from surrounding noises, so as to read and wrte 'with perfect comfort amid tbe play of children or near the dancing and songs of savages." His early ambition was to proceed to China as a rmedical missionary, but when he had qualified for this office, the opium war was raging, and some friends induced him to change both the character and the sphere of duty he had proposed to himself, and the upshot was that, after a course of theological training both in Glasgow antd England, he proceeded as a clerical missionary to Kturuman, thten the furthest inland station of the London Society. That energy which carried him subsequently through the hardships and perils of travel exhibited itself at the outset of his career. The first step he took was to retire to a solitary spot called Lepelole, and there cut himself off from all European society for six months, gaining by this ordeal a complete insight into the habits, ways of thinking, and language of the tribe, which was subsequently his main instrument in obtaining access to regions that would otherwise have been barred to the boldest explorer. In 1843 he removed to Mabotsa (lat. 25014', long. 26030'), a site which he had selected for a missionary station, in a beautiful valley, and there and in the neighbourhood for nearly six years employed himself in the performance of his duties in a large and liberal spirit. " Sending the Gospel to the heathen," says he, " must include much more than is implied in the usual picture of a missionary,-namely, a man going about with a Bible under his arm. The promotion of commerce ought to be speciaUy attended to, as this, more speedily than anything elso, demolishes that sense of isolation which heathenism engenders, and makes the tribes feel themselves mutually dependent on and inutually beneflcial to each other. My observations on this subject make me extremely desirous to promote the preparation of the raw materials of European Manufactures in Afriea, for by that means we may not only put a stop to the slave trade, bat introduce the negro into the body corpo-ate of nations. . . . Sccess inthis, in both Eastern and Western Africa, would lead in the course of time to a much larger diffusion of the blessings of civilization than efforts exclusively spiritual and educational confined to any one small tribe. These, however, it would, of course, be extremel,y dedrable to cary on at the samo time at large central and healthy stations, for neither civiization nor Christianity can be promoted alone. In fact, they are inseparable." This conviction of the reciprocal benefits conferred upon each other by commercial and religious intercourse seems to have been the principal motive in impelling our traveller to undertake a journey which led to the discovery of the Lake Ngami, a most important link in the chain or his subsequent achievements. Sechele, a chief of the Bakwains, who dwelt in the neighbourhood of the doctor's station, owed the reinstation in his chieftaimnhip to one Sebituane, a sort of African Napoleon, who, after a series of stirring adventures, had, at the time of Dr. Livingston's arrival in Africa, possessed himself of a widely extended power, of which the centre was a town called Linyanti (lat. 18° 17' 20", long. 23° 50' 9"). The great wish of his life had been to establish a direct intercourse with the white men. Sechele, who was extremely attached to Dr. Livingston, and had embraced Christianity, spoke to him on the subject of Sebituane's power and generosity, and excited in the doctor a strong desire to make the acquaintance of so remarkable a personage. The influence of Sebituane, if not his actual sway, extended southwards beyond the Lake Ngami, which from the enormous quantities of elephants that haunt It and the neighbouring region may be considered tle principal source of the ivory supply. But between this attractive object and the country of Sechele there lay an extensive desert which had the reputation of being impassable by Europeans, at any rate except just after the conclusion of the rainy season, in the months of March and April, when pools of rain water might possibly be found here and there. In spite, however, of the threatened dangers, Dr. Livingston determined to attempt to cross. The opposition of the Boers, of whom he makes most bitter complaints, had prevented anything more being effected in the way of missionary enterprise among the tribes to the eastward, and he formed the bold resolution of striking out a fresh path in a region far distant from their influence. This great plain, however, which Dr. Livingston prepared to cross, is not so entirely devoid of the means of subsistence as its name, the Kalahari Desert, might lead one to suppose. If the coneshape mass of land which forms the promontory of the Cape be supposed divided into three longitudinal strips, each region will pretsent a special peculiarity of climate. The eastermnost strip is mountainous and well-wooded, its seaboard gorges being clad with gigantic timber. It is well-watered with streams and flowing rivers, the annual supply of rain is considerable, and the inhabitants (Caffres or Zulus) are a tall, brave, and well-developed race. The next strip or zone, which embraces the centre of the continent, consists mainly of extensive, slightly undulating plains, with few springs and streams, and a very scanty supply of rain. Without artificial irrigation no European grain can be raised, and every few years there are severe droughts. One of these occurred during Dr. Livingston's residence, and proved a great obstacle to his success, as it was associated in the minds of all the people with his attempts at proselytizing. They belleved that he had bound Sechele with some magic spell, and he continually received deputations of the more influential counsellors, entreating that the victim might be allowed only to make a few showers; for, unfortunately, this Bakwain chief had enioyed the reputation of being an extremely skilful rainmaker, and the despair of his subjects at the condition to which they saw themselves reduced was such that one feels slurprised they should have confined themselves to expostulations with the supposed eause of the mischief, "'We like you,' said Sechele's uncle, a very InfIaential and sensible man, ' as well as if you bad been born among us, but we wish you would give up that everlasting preachIn and praying; we cannot become familiar with that at aU. You se owe never get rain, while those tzibes wvho never pray as we do obtain abundance.' ' Only let tho chief make rain this once,' groaned the deputation, ' and we will all-men, women, and children-come to the school and sing and pray as long as you please.' Sechele himself, however, remained stanch to his n,ew creed. His only doubts were as to the method of conversion best adapted for his subjects. 'Do you imagine these people will ever believe by your merely talking to them?' he said once to the patient teacher; 'I can make tem do nothing except by thrashingthem, and if you lik I shall call my head men, and with our litiipa (whips of rhinoceros hide) we will soon miake them all heeve together. "' This central strip of Southern Africa is inhabited by Bechiuanas, of which the Bakwains are one tribe. Dr. Livingston considers them as of the same stock with the 2affres, but inferior to them In physical development as -well as in carriage, although in both these points they are superior to the inhabitants of the westernmost of the three divisions-a level region of vast extent, including the Kalahari Desert, upon which acarcely any rain ever falls. It is inhabited by Bushmen and 3Bakalahari, the former being the remnants of the aboriginal race of South Africa, the latter of a swarm of Bechuanas, who in early times emigrated from the central region. These still retain the love of their ancestors for agricultre and domestica,ted animals, M tMsioniary Travels and Besearches in South Africa, by David Livingston, LLD., D.C.L. Lozdoii JolqhMnl ray, even under the unfavourable circumstances of their present location; but the Bushmen are real nomads, never rearing any domestic animnal except the dog, or cultivatng the soiL They follow the wild animals in their migrations, as wolves are said in America to accompany the herds of buffaloes, and prey upon them as they range from place to place. I u-ar author describes them as possessing thin wiry 1 forms, capable of great exertion under severe privations, of low stature, but not (as is commonly believed) absolutely dwarfish. They, as well as the Bakalahari, possess an intense love of liberty; and the scarcity of water in the desert they inhabit is a more effectual guarantee for it than the most powerful armies or fleets. The manner of procuring water is very singular. The country is remarkably fla, but intersected in different parts by the beds of ancientrivers, cuttmigthrough a soil of light-coloured soft sand, nearly pure silica. These beds contain much alluvial soil, and this being hard baked by the burning sun rain 'water stands in pools here and there for several months. Sometimes the Bushmen cover these with sand for the sake of security, and even make a fire over the spot, but this does not prevent the attainment of the precious liquid. " When they wish to draw water for use the women como with 20 or 30 of their water vessels in a bag or net on their backs. These water vessels consist of ostrich eggshells. with a hole in the end of each such as would admit one's finger. The women tie a buneh of grams to one end of a reed aboat two feet long, and insert it in a hole dug as deep as the arm will reach; then ram down the wet sand firmly round it. Appling the mouth to the free end of the reed, they form a vacuum in the grass beneath, in which the water collects, and in a short time rises into the mouth. An eggshell is placed on the ground alongside the reed, some inches below the mouth of the sucker, and a straw guides the water into the hole of the vessel, as she draws mouthful after mouthful from below. The wholo stock of water is thus passed through the woman's mouth as a pump, and when taken home is carefully buried. I have come into villages where, had we acted a domineeiing part and rummaged every hut, we should have found nothing, hut by sitting down quietly and waiting ith patience unt-il the villagers were led to form a favourable opinion of us, a woman, would bring out a shellful of the precious fluid from I know not where." Addison was certainly right in making his African hunter " bless his stars and think it luxury" when he chanced to light on " an untasted spring." This bemouthed iwater, however, is by no means the worst modification of the elenient which the traveller in Africa is compelled to accept with thankfulness. At one place (Nchokotsa),- " The water was bitter, and presented indications not to be nistaken of having passed through animal systems before." At another (Koobe),- " There was such a rmass of mud in the pond, worked up by the wallowing rhinoceros to the consistency of mortar, that only by great labour could we get a space cleared at one side for the water to ooze through and colleot in for the oxen. Should the rhinoceros come back, asingleroU in the great rnass we had thrown on one side would have rendered all our labour vain. It was thereford necessary for us to guard the spot by night. On these great ilats all around we saw m the white sultry glare herds of zebras, gnus, and occasionally buffaloes, standing for days looking wistfully towards the wells for a share of the nasty water." But for its own children the Kalahari Desert is not without resources. There are large quantities of grass rising in tufts, with bare spaces between, which servea for food to some species of antelopes that can subsist for months without drinking. In the stomachs of elands, when killed, there is sometimes found a considerable quantity of water, although it was impossible that the animals while living could have had access to any. Other creatures such as the steinbock, the gemsbock, and the porcupine, are enabled to subsist by digging up bulbs and tubers containing moisture. One of these, named Leroshua, is a real blessing to man as well as beast. It appears above the ground in the form of a small plant with a stalk not thicker thau a crow. quill, but on digging down a foot or 18 inches a tuber is found of the size of a child's head,' containing a mass of cellular tisue filled with fluid like a young turnip. Another kind called MAokuri, a herbaceous creeper, deposits underground a number of tubers as large as a man's head, at spots in a circle of a yard radius around the stem. The natives strike the ground on the circumference with stones, and when the difference of sound indicates the existence of the waterbearing tuber beneath they dig down and find it about a foot beneath the surface. Yet more remarkable is the water melon, which, when a little more rain than usual falls, covers vast tracts of the country. In 1852 an English traveller took advantage of their abundance to go straight across the desert from a point a little south of Kolobeng, lat. 24 deg., long. 26 deg. to Lake Ngami. His oxen subsisted on the water melon for no less than 21 successive days without drinking, and on reaching water at the expiration of that time appeared indifferent to it. It was on the 1st of August, 1849, that Lake Ngami lay expanded before the eyes of Dr. Living. ston and his companions, the first Europeans who had ever visited it. They had left Kolobeng on the lst of June, but only about half of the interval had been consumed in crossing the desert. Early in July they came upon the Zouga, a fine river ranning out of the lake, and on which, after following its banks for nearly a hundred miles, they embarked in canoes navigated by the friendly inhabitants of the country. Nothing could be more erroneous than the opinions which have been entertained of this part of Africa except, perhaps, those relative to the tract north of the equator, which have been refuted by the almost contemporaneous discoveries of Dr. Barth. Instead of being the centre of a sterile plain, lake Ngami is the lowest point of an immense i tract of country, all excellently watered and thickly wooded. It is in fact the reservoir of a number of rivers which drain a surface extending from 12 deg. to 21 deg. of latitude, and 18 dog. to 23 deg. of longitude. Estimatino. the elevations above the level of the sea by the temperature at which water boiled, Dr. Livingston calculated that he had descended 2,000 feet after leaving Kolobeng before he reached the lake. Sebituane was unfortunately about 200 miles to the north of Ngamni when the travellers arrived on its banks, and the jealousy of a native chief suCceeded in opposing an effectual obstacle to any further progress. The next year Livingston renewed the attempt, but on reaching the lake his children fell sick of fever, and he was obliged to' return to " the pure air of the desert" on their account. A third trial was at last successful. Instead of going westward to the lake, a northern route through the desert was taken under the guidance of a Bushman. The risk of this proceeding may be imagined from the circumstance that between certain springs and the country of Sebituane the guide gave no hopes of water in less, than a month. Happily he was mistaken in this particular, being in fact altogether disqualified for the task he had undertaken, for on the second day he lost himself. On the fourth day he vanished altogether, and the party were left to their own resources. The supply of water in the waggons had been wasted by one of the servants, and there was none to 'satisfy the pressing demands of the missionary's children. At last they saw some birds, and afterwards the trail of a rhinoceros, an infallible evidence of the existence of water. The oxen were unyoked, and at once rushed off to the westward towards a river which was found in that direction. It was not until the afternoon of the next day that some of the people returned with water, and in the meantime there was every prospect of the poor children perishingbefore their parents' eyes. Indeed, although rescued from the horrible fate which seemed impending, the travellers were not to escape scatheless. The oxen, In their rush towards the river, had passed through a small patch of trees haunted by a kind of fly caUed tsgtse, the bite of which, although producing no more pain to man than the sting of a mosquito, is nearly certain death to horse, ox, or dog. The animal is not startled by the bite, but in a few days the eye and nose begin to run, the coat to stare, a swelling appears under the jaw, and soinetimes at the navel; emaciation commences, and at last purgig comes on, and the creature dies in a state of extreme exhaustion. Sometimes the disease is months in running its course; at others, especially when the animal is in good condition, staggering and blindness come on soon after the infliction of the bite, as if the brain were affected. The strangest part of the whole is that the poison affects neither the mule, the ass, nor the goat, nor yet calves while sucking. The wild animals, too, appear to possess an immunity from iU effects, at least zebras, buffaloes, and 'antelope3 are seen feeding quietly in the midst of ts6tse although here it is possible that death may follow after a time, either naturally or by the agency of some of the Carnivora, to which herbivorous animals generally fall victims as soon as their activity diminishes. The apparent inadequacy of so insignificant a cause as the bite of a small fly to produce such terrible effects, and of such an anomalous character, made some of the party imagine that the mischle6 must be vaiuid by some poWQliQo plaut. But Q2o1 Qther I Eettled that point by riding a horse up to a l Emal hill infested by the insect, and remaining only long enough to take a view of the country and catch some specimens of ts*se* on the animal, which was not suffered to graze. In ten days the horee was dead. The adventure we have just related cost Dr. Livingston 43 of his own oxen. Fortunately, they lasted out till he reached Sebituane, who received him with a warm welcome, but added, "Your cattle are aU bitten by the *e*e and will certainly die; but never mind, I have oxen and will give you as many as you need." Yetthe animals had been carefully watched, and whUe under the superintendence of the travellers scarcely a score of flies had ever settled on them. The chief whom our traveller had with such difficulty reached was not destined long to enjoy that intercourse with vhite men which had been the wish of his heart. He fell ill of inflammation in the lungs originating in a former wound, and died"the best specimen of a native chief," says Dr. Livingston, "that I ever saw." At his death the chieftainship devolved, according to his desire, on a daughter, who was absent 12 days' journey to the north. Altogether there was a sad fatality about the expedition. The Makololo (Sebituane's subjects) had only the year before commenced the slave trade. Except for the obstacles thrown in his way by LecheelatWbe, the chief on the banks of the Lake Ngani, to which we have adverted, Dr. Livingston would have arrived in time to prevent such a misfortune. I The seducers were the Mambfarl, a tribe near Bih6 (lat. 12° 30', long. 170), who had been accustomed to trade with the Barotse, a negro race whose country the Makololo and their chief had conquered. From the time of the conquest the sale of children was forbidden,butunfortunately, inrl850, the MAmbAri,after a long interval, returned with a number of old Portuguese guns. Sebituane had only recently come out victor from a contest for actual existencewith a Caifre tribe beyond the river Zambesi, and thought these guns would be excellent in any future invasion of his enemies. Ee offered cattle or ivory, but the traders would take nothing but boys of 14 years of age. The temptation was great, and eight old muskets were secured in exchange for as many Barotse youths. The Marabari now ventured on a further atep. They proposed a foray against some tribes to the eastward, on the conditions that while the Makololo were to keep all the cattle, they should have the human captives as a recompense for the loan of their guns. Two hundred slaves were the produce of this wicked affair, and, worse still, the Makololo, in the course of the expedition fell in with some Arabs from Zanzibar, who gave them three English muskets in return for about 30 of their captives. Thus a tribe, hitherto uncontaminated by the horrible traffic in human flesh, was brought into communication with slavemarkets both on the Eastern and Western Coasts of Africa. The ice was broken, and the following year Dr. Livingston found many of the Makololo gentry clothed in baize of different colours and cotton prints, all purchased by the sale of their own serfs. To stop the evil only one course was now feasible, and that was by opening up a highway from the coast Into the centre of the country, to supply those very goods which bad been obtained by slave dealing, in direct exchange for ivory and other products of the country. To this object Dr. Livingston proposed to devote himself. Mamochisane, the daughter of the deceased chief, inherited her father's partiality for the white men. The last words he spoke had been an expression of kindness to one of the doctor's children, and now his successor sent the travellers permission to visit any part of her dominions they pleased. Availing themselves of this, the doctor and his companion, Mr. OQwell, were rewarded in the end of June, 1851, with the view of a magnificent river, with a deep channel, from 300 to 600 yards broad, although seen at its lowest. This was the Zambesi, which falls into the sea at about lat. 190 on the eastern side of Africa, and which the Portuguese charts had represented as rising considerably to the east of the point (lat. 17° 31' 38", long. 25013' E.), where it showed itself rolling abody oftwater of such magnitude. EIere, it was obvious, the most favourable conditions presented themselves for the solution of the great social problem. Here was a highway ample enough for any amount of commerce. Was it also continuous Toall appearance it promised a direct communication with the Indian Ocean on the east, and on the west the means of water carriage to some point not far distant fromthe valley of the Coanza. The paramount chief on its banks was favourable to the opening of the trade for which it offered facilities. Everything seemed to recommend the resolution at which our traveller arrived to return to the Cape, send his famnily to Eugland, and, freed from the impedimnenta which wife and children involve, even when, as in the case of a missionary's family, they are " to the manner born," to explore alone the new region that dffered itself. How he sped in this, the most perilous as the most important of all his undertakings, we propose to describe in a future notice.
s4CRED HARmONIC SOCIErY. Last night, in the large room of Exeter-hal, a trial of anthems, choruses, and madrigals took place, which was interesting alike to the lover of choral part-singing and to the friends of the Sacred Harmonic Society. The singers filled the orchestra and a considerable portion of the area. Their exact numbers could not be ascertained, but it was surmised that in all there were about 1,300 voices, treble, alto, tenor, and bass, the alto parts being equally divided between ladies and gentlemen (contraltos and altos), wgith a certain admixturc of boys, while the trebleseconsisted exclusively oE ladies. The following was the pro. gramme, the first part of which was devoted to sacred, the second to secular music: PART L Anthem-" We w1 reiolce" Croft. Chorsn-" T es Saeerdo3" (in G) Leo. Anthem-" I will are' .. .. . .. .. Creighton. Chorus-" FRghteous Heaven" (sanna) . .. andeL Anthem-" We have beard with oer ears" .. PAlestrina. Anthem-"1 In Thee, 0 Lord" . o. .. Weldon.

There was no orchestrathe aCCompaniments to the sacred pieces being played on the organ by Mr. Brownsmitb, who also indicated the key at the commencement of each of the madrigals. It may be readily believed, on one hand, that in the first instance the nitch was generally better sustained than In the second, ana, on the other, that the vocal parts were much more easily dis. tinguished in the second than in the first. Each had its advantage and each its disadvantage. It would of course be preposterous to expect that such a vast body of voices could sing a madrigal, from end to end, without wavering in pitch; or that an instrament of such enormous power as the organ at Exeter-haD, how. ever well played, could do otherwise, when constantly employed, than in some degree obscure the clearness of the vocal score. The latter is the case, even at the regular concertsof the Sacred Harmonic Society, with the sharply defining orchestra to counterbalance it that it should have -been so last night,when the voices were deprived of this advantage, was therefore by no means surprising. Inother respects the performance afforded the highest satisfaotion. The long series of drillings promised, under the superintendence of so able and experienced a chief as Mr. Costa, will no doubt lead to results of the highest consequence, and Insure for the metropolitan contingent at the next Hlandel commemoration, an efficiency with which .St is to be hoped that amateur and professional singers .in the country may keep pace. The great festival proposed .to bo held in 1859 at the Crystal Palace, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Handel's death, will be a test of what all England can do in the way of choral singing; and the honour of the provinces is quite as much concerned in the event as that of London generaUy, or of the Sacrod Harmonic Society in particular, which was the first to set the scheme on foot. Such trials of strength as that of last night, when a large number of the chorus read the music " at sight," wil materialy aid the object in contemplation. 'The programme itself was interesting, inasmuch as It brought some of the elder ItalianR and English matters together, and showed that both in the sacred and secular styles the English could hold their own. It also illustrated the supremacy of Mozart, both as a musical inventor and as a master of counterpoint, the magnificent chorus from his Litany towering far above everything in the concert. This and the genial madrigil of Edwards were the best and most effective nerformances of the evening. The madrigal of Bonnet was rehearsed three times. It is not so striking as the other, but it is more difficult. At first Mr. Costa could obtain neither "light and shade" nor accent; " piano," much less ianis4liMo,"wasontofthequestion.Butporseverancemeets w ith its reward in the end, and after much pains the energe. tic director carried his point triumuhantly. As curiosities may be mentioned the chorus of Leo, and the anthem of Palestrina-both good examples of composers who, however uinattractive their works may now appear to aU but the learned, exercised in their time a strong and individual influence on the progrmes of the art. These men knew little of melody, but they helped to lay the foundations of harmony; and no one, perhaps, owed so much to them as the author of the Mesu8k, who,-much more famillar with the works of the Itaian musicians than with those of his formidable contemporary, John Sebastian Bach,unitirng his instinct of melody to a command of the resources of harmony even far surpassitg theirs first pro. * hamed to the world, in a thoroughly comprehensive sense, of what the art of music was capable.

SuJBB.ANE TELM BrTwEzE FRAiCll AND ENGLAND.-M. A. Thom6 de Gamond, a well-known French engineer, has published a quarto volume, treating of a project for constructing a tunnel between England and France. The idea was brought under the attention of the Emperor some time since, and a committee formed to report thereon. A number of scientific gentlemen have lately formed themselves Into a club at Paris, and AL Thome de Gamond's submariRe tannel has conatituted tho first subject for investigation. Most of the journals of Paris have taken up the curious problem, and thus created a certain amount of interest in this "e isu ive,"' as the Sicie exclaims. It is proposed to cut a tunnel from Cape Grinez, on the French coast, to a point 'which is about midway between Folkestone and Dover. A coloured dIagram at the end of the volume shows the character of the geological deposits of the bed of the channel, and Al. Gamond believes he has discovered a stratum which 'would be admirably suited for piercing. According to the information obtained, the stratum consists partly of a white soft stone and argillaceous earths of three different ages-vlz., a zone of Oxford clay, a zone of Kimmeridge clay, 50 metres thick, and a zone of weald clay, whicb on tho English side is uppermost. Having satisfied himself as to the nature of the deposits he would have to cut through, the engineer shows how he believes the tunnel might be successfully constracted. An island occurs at the bottom of the sea called the " Vamne Star," and exclusive of this natural advantage 13 artifioial islands more are to be made in the channel along the projectedlino. Theseislands are to be compoeedof rock cemented with clay, the section of each presenting a trapezium, the lower base of which is about 220 metres in length, the altitude 65, and the upper base 40. Through these islands shafts are to be sunk to the level of tho projected tunnel - and this done the work of excavation may be commenced on2 pit at once. The cost of the tunnel is to be 170,000,OOf. The projector has evidently bestowed an mmnense amount of labour on his calculations before he satisfied himself of the possibillty of excsuting a work which has formod the dream of many enthusiasts, none of whom, however, have brought to light so much geological Information, and none of wbiom hAve dared to appkly the advanoed discoveries of science to new and gigantio difficulties.

Cotton.-Tbe improved podtion of the market observabld at the close of last week has proved only temporary, anit renewed dulness and depression, accompaied by a ios* drop in prices, have again set in, with very limited aaiethroughout the week. It is almost imposible to give quoa_ tions with any degree of accracy, mach depending on the necesities or fears of the seller; there is, however, a de. cline averaging about Ad. to id. per lb. in the curfent qualities or American, but much irregularity prevai 'The sales of Brazil have been on a very small mleW, at about a similar or even a greaerreduction.

THE UNBAIPLOYRD. NOTTINGHAM, FRIDAy. The town was perfectly quiet last night. Temporary relief has been afforded to a great many families,and thereo i an arrangement tnat for the present the ablebodied men shall receive outdoor relief and be employed in the constractiorn of a new road, which is to run the length of the Forest, commencing st the northern boundary of the church cemetery, and extending to the AIfreton-road. One of the youthsl captured for being concerned in the riot on Tuesday night has been sentenced to six months' isaprisonment. Yesterday several thousand persons assembled at the doors of the Nottingham Theatre in consequence of an announcoement that Mr. Wallet, " Queen's Jester," would distribute l,5001b. of bread to the unemployed people of Nottingham. There was a tremendous rush to the lace a long time before the distribution took place. Vho bread was given *Lway in 21b. loaves. No dis. turbance took place, ascd the crowd after receiving thebrea. were quietly dLspersed by a body of police. Special constables were summoned at ball-past 2o'clock this afternoon,. and additions were made from the county force, every means being adopted by the cvil authorities to prevent the monster meeting of the operatives, which was to takeo plac this afternoon at 3 o'clock in the market-place. 5 o'clock p.m. The town remains perfectly tranquil. The mayor ancf magistrates have succeeded in preventing a meeting of the - operatives. Many came in from the country districts, but quietly dispersed when they found the meeting was not to ba held. It was generally believed that upon the meeting being. prevented in the market-place the men would assemble in N ottingham Forest, and every precautionary measure wa-. taken to disperse any crowd that might come together there. In the country districts the county police were prepared to act at a moment's notice, and in fact, every means was adopted to maintain the law. Uappily to the present tim. tranquillity prevails.
TaE MAMTuFACT.& rI?D DismicTs.-The accounts from the manufacturing districts this week do not show much improvement, although the reports are not moreunsatisfactory than miaht have been expected. At Stock-. port nearly all tbe mills are working either three or four days a-week, while the rest are stopped entirely. Crow&d of idle operatives lounge in the principal thoroughfares. The pawn shops are driving an active trade, aud there aremore recruits for the militia than can be attended to. The collectors of poor-rates find it impossible to levy their demnands upon many of the operatives whose families are themselves crying for bread. At Bolton there is a marked increase in tho number of applicantsforpoor-lawrelief, compared with the corresponding period of last year, the excess for the last weeek being 32S, A similar pressure of' applications has been experienced by the board oE guardianx at Oldham, who a. their ltfi meeting dlscussed a memorial to the Central Board, praying them to suspend the operation of the restrictive order compellirg boards of guardians to apply a labour test to all ablebodied applicants for relief. A di.cussion on the subject; was deferred to the next meeting, but notice waa given of a motion for a general reduction of the salaries of the offioes of the union from 10 to 20 per cent. in order to relieve to some extent tho heavy burdens of the ratepayers. At Preston from 20,000 to 25,000 people are wandering about the streets wholly or in great part out of emrloyment. Several married labourers have already deserted their families and entered the army. A movement has been com- naenced for +he establishment of a public soup kitchen; Thelargest manufacturers in the town, Messrs. Horrocke, Mller, and Co., are now working 40 hours a-week, beingone hour a-day more than of late, and Messrs. Horrocks and Jackson continue to run full time. The mills at Halifax are generally working short time, and many people are ont of employment altogether. Messrs. Crossley, tho large carpet manufacturers, who have for several years pest been annually extending their premises, have had to comraenoe ranning short time in consequence of the *amost entire suspenFion of their trade with the United Statev.^. At Roohdalo trade is becoming verv depressed. The failure of a flannel manufacturer, named J. T. Barnes, of Wilnrow,; is announced. A considerable augmentation in the numberof paupers applying for relief at the Ashton Union is re. ported. Tho silk-weavers of Midcleton are sufferingseverely from the prevailing distress, and have beld meetings appealing to the public for relief. A sabscription has been commenced by the rector, the Bev. Canon Durford, and provisions are being distribnted to the more needy. Several of the mills at Lancaster are running short time, and there is every prorpect of a hard winter. Both tbBleading branches of the trade at Coventry are under pressure, and some agitation prevails among the weavers on account of their reduced earnings. The watch trade Is almost crippled. At Sheffield there have been several stoppages of small firms, but on thcwhole the crisis is better sustained than might have ber. anticipated. At Barnsley the trade continues pretty steady,. and there are considerably less symptoms of distress than at;many places. There have been some disturbances at Mottinuham in consequence of the sudden check *iven to the trade there, but things are now quiet. The board oZ guardians are giving outdoor relief. In Staffordshire themanufacturers as a body are reducing their establishments. At Birmingham the arrival of a military detachment has. been regarded as indicatlnS apprehensions of disturbances, for which, however, there IS not the slightest ground. :hHT&r Lrr.-There have of late been manr inventions for tho purpose of affording a cheap and econeo.- mical light at night. Mr. SpiUer, of Holborn-hil], has, however, patented a lamp callel the Lover's lamp, whichrappears to have advantages over most of those now in use. It nortable, convenient, and economlcal. There is a floaIng tube, and with common care the disagreeable effect oI having an overflow of oil is avoided, and with one trimmig a good light is provided for several nights, inerely with the trouble of inserting a fresh wick, which may be done ina stantly without soiing the fngers- The lamp is not onlyeasily fed but easily clened. Another great advantge Is. that this famp, while it is very serviceable for the bedroom, may be carried about without the inconvenience of rpillin the oil, and thus, while it my be substituted for ambet candle to move from the sttingroom t the bedroom, while placed by the bedide it gives £ sufficent light mia. to read with, and there is the additional cemfortth4 I attended to with commoix care, there Isno fea of I6 volt out before morning, as Is the case 'ith som of th iliti 44wics heMefWr aAopUtds
