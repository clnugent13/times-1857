|T CIVIL $ERVICE 0UPA4Zq UATIO4 1. . ~~QuBp2To2, I . The following statement of this very h c has been sent us for publication:- "-1. In 181 and 1812 the ofloers of the Customs a>& Excie lwre in poession of a superanr,ution fund amounting*t 334,0001., all of rhich wa ppropriated by the 51s of Geore 111,, chap. 55, and the 52d of George Ill, chaps. s0and 81, to the wrants of the Government on eonditl;on that the officers of tJhose departments should never ho required to payr any contributions towards thei auwperan "2. In 1822 the comAdt of 1812 w departed from by the imposition of a tax on the offioers of the Cusoms anu1t Excie, as well a on the other civil servants, to provide oe, moietyof tbeirsuperannuations (3d of George IV., chap. 113). This, however, exised only two years, for in 18 (5th of George IV., chap. 104) the tax was reDealed and thesums levied under it were repaid to the officers Tbe pein.- cipleandpolicyof 'freesuperanunations' werethereby In the most substantive form reaffirmed by Parliament. "3. In 1828 the Government brought in a Bill to re-enact the main features of the Act of 1822; but the feeling of the. House was so strong against it that it was withdrawn. "4. On the 4th of Augus, 1829, the Government, by a. Treasury minute, imposed upon civil rervants who entered after that date, a snperannuation tax of 2; per oent. on alP alaries not exceeding 1001. a-year, and 5 of per oent oialth other saaries; and it was not until 1834, that that tax was. confirmed by Parliasment-4th and 5th of WilliAm IV. cap. 24. "5. All eivil servants who entered prior to the 4thof Angust, 1829, are not enly exempt from that tax, but hsvea far better scale of pensions hn those who pay it. HiLg politicaL, judicial, and diplomatic functionaries, althiough they have entered the public service after the 4th oET August, 1829, as well a about 2,000 workmen and otlhr in the dock-yards, arsenals, and the Post-offices receivea *tnhsionn*8 m thereto. Shte, do not pay any tax in contri. "6. The tax is at present upwards of 66,0001. per annu, wfhile the pensions paid to those who have been sub,ected toit amount to about ll,OOOh per annum. The total amount. contributed by the officers since the tax was imposed T years ago) is about 900,0001. The total amount retuzned tothe contributors in superannuation allowances during thxat period, is about 80,0001, leaving a net thrplus of about. b20,ooo4. That surplus, if it hAd been funded on theprn ciples of an insurance-office, would have amounted to aout one milhon sterling to the credit of the contributors,MT whom it is found only about one in seven wil ever attain superannuation the contributionsof the other six-sevenths of the officers 6eing entirely absorbed by the State, to ther great privation of the fansilie of deosed contributorth " 7. In February, 1856, the Chanoellor of the Exchequerbrought in a Bill (No. 37) improving the scale and systemie£ £uperannU tion, but continuing the tx. sg 8 byr. Roebuck subsequently presented a petition, sopned by 10,000 of the civil servants, praying for a repal of the tax, whereupon the Billand petition were ref d: a select committee of the House, " 9. The select committee condemned the tax, and re. solved that it should ceae on the lit of April, 1857, on con. dition that the salaries of the civil servants be previoudly revised, with due regard to the amount of deduceions remitted.' " 10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer thereupon, in July, introduoed a Bill (No. 223), which, being destractiveof the whole principle of his firt Bill (No. 37), gave such universal dissatisfaction that it was withdrawn in deferenceto the general wish of the Houe "IL The reduction of salaries contemplated under the proposed revision would have placed the officers in a worsposition than they are at present, seeing that under the. Bll No. 223 the superaunuations would nave been -akcu lated on reduced salaries. "1.2. Thepresent scale of salries has been fxed (aftEr several reductions in 1821, 1828, 1834, and subsequently) inconsideration of the ' value of the work to be done,' without. contemplating any abatement forsuperannuation; andthose salaies, if paid in fuLl, as voted by Parliament, would be, but a ' proper' and moderate remuneration for the work and responsibility of each office, as was cearly shown by SirCharles Trevelyan, Mr. Stephenson, and lJir. Bromley in their valuable evidence before the select committee. " It has also been shown that the nominal salaries of the 16,353 civil servants, averaging only 1411. a-year (two thirds. averaging only 861. a-year), are inadequate to bear this grievously partial tax without entailing domestic dictress. " The civil servants of the Crown, therefore, 'in general committee,' sustained by the resolutions of theselect committee of the House of Commons, 'That it is desirable to do away with the system by which a portion of the salaries of the civil servants is deducted on accountf of superannuation allowances,' and ' That the practice of providing superannuation pensions for members of the permanent civil service, is based on the sound principles. of policy,' have adopted as their prayer, on this important question, 'the re-introduction of the Chancellor of the Eoxchequer's original Bill (No. 37) of last session, farther amended by an extension of the scale of yearly increments therein contained to three-fourths of the officer's salary fora period of 40 years' service, and the abolition of the, superannuation tax, by the repeal of the 27th section of the "By order of the General Committee of Civil Servants; " WILLIAM OWENT, Chairman, "HENRY ANCELIL Hon. Secretary. Registrar-General's office, Somerset-house. Feb 27."
TEHE BBxK OF FRAacE.-A Paris letter in the NVord gives the following details of the discussions Wikch have lately been held at the Tuileries relative to the newBMll concerning the Bank of France:-"Extraordinary Councils were held on Thursday and Friday, the Emperor ,iding. They were composed of all the members of thx Council of Ainisters; IL Schneider, acting at present a,, President of the Legislative Body, several members of the Council of State, and M. Emile P6reire. The uestion to be discussed was that of prolonging the privilegeof the BaLnk of France, with an augmentation of its capital aLs set forth in the draught of tuhe Bill already agreed to by the Council of Ministers, and now submitted to the Counol of State. The Emperor, first of alI, addressed 3L PWreire, anci requested him to express his opinion on the question under consideration. I cannot, very naturaUy, give you a deiIect account of all M. 1'relixes argmuents, butlI understandthat he strongly opposed the B as quite inadequate to afford the Bank sufficient means of offering real assistance to commerce and public credit. The same view was strongly sapported by AL Michel Chevalier, Councillor of State, the well-known writer on political economy. The speakers orn the other side were, I understand, principall M. Schneider and cl. Vuitry, of the Council of State. At th second day's sitting, at which the Emperor again presided, the same ner. sons were present, withthe exoeption of Md. Pereire, inw v .ho p lace were Baron James de Rothschild and M Bartholony, President of the Orleans Board of Directors. IL do Rothschild spoke in exactly the same sense as M. P6reire had done, strongly opposing the measure. aNo decision wa_ come to, but it is stated on good authority that the Empororappeared much struck by the objections made by these able. and experienced financiers. The accord between M. de, Rothschild and X Pcreire was above all remarked, for, wa a certain antagonism exists between these two gentlemen, it was very evident that they could not have conoerted to. gether on the measure under deliberation. It is now nob too much to suppose that the BiDl, on which the Council oE State itself has had so much trouble to agree, wil besensiblymodified, and even perhaps postponedl to another aessior.. This delay, caused solely by the a Iracn close of thesession ofethe Legislative Body, weUXdbhil; objecti9n. able. But the Paris money.masrket would have strng reason to coa2ratulate itself on a change in the sense whiech has been recommended at the two meetings of which I speak.

IOY9BY-.BKBTatuZCITYI.YTELLG;,YOB. Tuesday Evening. Ih9s quotation of gold at Parls is about 6 per §11e premium, and the short exchange on London l2&22& per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates viith te English Mint price of 3t. 17s. 10id. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is .nearly 4-eOths per cent, dearer in Paris thanx in E ondon. BY advices from Hamburg the price of gold is X per mark, and the short exchange on L ondon is 33. 4t per 11. sterling. Standard geld at the English .lit price is therefore about 2-1Oths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London. The coums of exchange at New York on Londonfor !bllh at 60 days' sight is about 109k per cent. which, srhen compared with the Mint proportions between ,Me two countries, shows that the exchange is about at par. And after making allowance for charges of iransport and difference of interest, the present rate fleaves a trifling profit on the importation of gold ~xm the United States. The funds have fully maintained the improvetment of yesterday, and the market has not lost any of the favourable features which then appeared to have caused its change of tone. Consols for money, which leit off last evening at 93i, were first q~uoted 9t to i. From this they went to 93i, but t93S~ to 2 trss again the price at the official close. After regular hours there were buyers at 93g. For feJune account the last transactions were at 934 toe {. The rate for loans on Government securities 'was 6i per cent., for short periods, and 6 to 7 till the 4th of June. During the morning the demand vwas not great, but in the afternoon it rather sud'denly increased, so as to interfere to a slight'extent 'with the general signs of animation. Bank Stock lef off at 211 to 213; Reduced, 92 to i; New alhre per Cents., 92k to + ; India Stock, 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98+ to i; India bonds, lOs. to 54. disount; and Exchequer-bills (June) -6a to 2sa dicount, (March) 2s discount to 2s. iiThere wws again great actvity in the discountmarket to-day, and money could not be obtained in any quarter below the Bank minimum. The 3aeavy payments, however, which have fallen due at the begiming of this month being now cleared off, it is possible there may be more ease for the future. She large liabilities to be met to-day were upon the 'Three months' bills drawn at the commencement of YFebruary, the Ist of that month having fallen on a NSunday, which threw the payment to the 5th of Rfy instead of the 4th. Foreign securities were steady, and in some cases -there was a tendency to further improvement. Turish Six per Cents, for the account were nego"liated at 93i, i, and i, and the Four per Cents. for the account, 100*. The general business comiried-Brazilian FiveperCents. New, 100; Ecuador )ew Consolidated, 14; Mexiean, for the account, and ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45i, i, e Three per Cents., 1856, 46X; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 411; Spanish Certificates of Coupon not funded, 6 ; and Dutch 7our per Cents. Certificate., 97. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were firm, and in most instances were quoted a shade higber than last post. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 10c. for money, and 69f. 40c. for the end of I -the month, showing a further recovery of more than a quarter per cent. This movement is believed to be solely in response to the advanee on this side, the private accounts describing a complete absence -of any other encouragng influence. The subscription list for the Russian railway -scheme was closed this afternoon, and it is under-| atood that scarcely any English applications have -been received except from persons who, from the| niature of their business connexions withthe Russian qGovernment, or with the London eontractors, have felt compelled to come forward. Altogether the failure seems even more complete than was at first -anticipated. It is p resumed, however, that the wreal'figures connected with it will not he allowed to transpire, and that arrangements to that effect will ibe made at St. Petersburg. The commercial advices from New York this week ohow that remittances of specie may now continue to be expected by each packet. The stock-market still presented a dowvnward tendency, the news from Elnglahnd of the advance of the Bank rate of disc~ount to 6i per cent, having counteracted the pre'vious effect of a better supply of money. Erie Rail'way was quoted 46k; Rleading, 81; Panama, 92; New York Central, 87j; and Illinois Centra, 131*. The New York Tribune mentions the successful nlegotiation in London of 225,0001. of the bonds of the Panama Railroad Company. The last packet stated that 200,0001. had just been obtained in like 'mnanner on the bonds of some Western line, andthus, -notwithstanding the pressure in our discount market, we find capital being subscribed to be sentaway at the rate of nearly half a million sterling in a fortnight. 'The construction of the Ohio and - ississippi Rail- 'way, the shares of which are largely held in England, bad been completed on the 1oth of April, and regular trains were to commence running the entire distance between Cincinnati and St. Louis on the 1st of May. The length of the line is 341. miles, of which 106 have been constructed and stocked in the space of about nine months and a-half. City of Hamilton (Canada) Six per Cent. Debenture Bonds for 92,0001., redeemable in 18 or 19 years, have been brought on the London market for disposal. The amount is to be app)lied to the construction of' the Htamilton and Port Dover Railway. Persons in America directing letters for London should he careful to put the initial letters of the .metropolitan district intended above the word " London," and not under it. A leading house m Newv York having transmitted bills for 70,0001. in -3 letter directed " London, WV.C.," it was carried to lLondon, Western Canada. The 200,0001. of gold announced last week by the -Anglesey is expected to be delivered to-morrow, but only a portion of it will be retained. The market for silver is heavy, and further private advices from Ilfexico confirm the statement that the Parana, to arrive here about the 1st of June, may he expected to bring a large quantity. The wveekly reviews of the Amsterdam and Rot-. terdam produce markets state that business wras ac- I tive, writh a further advance in prices. Sugar and coilee had attracted the principal attention, but in- - creased operations had taken place in other articles. I The letters from Rouen mention that the market for manufactures was quiet. The returns of circulation of the Irish and Scotch:! banks for the four weeks ending the 11th of April, wrhen added together, give the followving as the average wveekly circulation of these banks -during the past month, viz.: Average circulation of the Irish banks .£........... 7,154,278 Average circulation of the Scotch banks ..3,8~32.5S5 Average circuLation during past month ... £10,9S6,863 On comparing the above writh the fixed issues of * lie several banks, as given in the Bankinge Alm1a, the following appears to be the state of the circulathon-. Sthe lrish bankes are abovo their fixed isse ... £799, 784 he Scotch hanka are above their fixed issue .. 745,376 Total above the fixed isse . , 1,545,160 The amounts of gold alld silver held at the head -offices of the several banks during the past month iave been as follows:- Gold and silver held by the Irish banks -.2,493,532 Gold and silver held by the Scotch batks ... 1,584,726 Total of gold and silver held ... ... £4,078,258 The above statements complete the returns of the circulation in England, Scotland, and Ireland for the month ending the 11th of April, which were partly inserted in The Times of the 5th of RIay. These retuns, combined with the average circulation of the Bank of England for the same period, will give the following results of the circulation of -motes in the United Kingdom when compared with the previous month:- showing an Increase of 829,2141. in the circulation of notes in England, and an increase of *814,3901 in the circulation of the United Kingdom, When compaX d with the month ending the 14th i Murch. and, as compared with the month ding the 12th of April, 1856, the above returns ~how a dev,~ei~e of 6'5,413. mn the chvu1atiQZI Qf notes in EEngland, and an increase of 673,3251. in the circulation of the United Kingdom. The average stock of bullion held by the Bank of England in both departments during the month ending the 11th of April was 9,G79,5471., being a decrease of 659,5951. as compared with the previous month, and a decrease of 564,9071. when compared with the same period last year. The stock of specie held by the Scotch and Irish banks during the month ending the 11th of April was 4,078,2581., being a decrease of 165,1941. as compared with the previous return, and an increase of 274,9411. when eompared with the corre. sponding period last year.

STATB OF TRADE. LEEDS, MAy 5. Pbther more business has been done in the doth-hais this moring than last Tuesday, yet the market on the whole has been a quet one. Seasonable goods moved off in small quantities. Tho somewhat ungenial character of the weathpr is doubtless operating against trade. HUDDERSFIELD, MAY 5. The woollen-market in most branches has been without much change this morning. The goods sold have been chie'dy of the botter class, with Borne few parcels of others of a general character for country houses. There is not much business doing in wool, and, though prices have fallen from ld. to 1jd. per lb., manufacturers appear to be waiting for a further decline, or for an improvement in their trade, to warrant them to increase their demand.

On the crews being seated in front of the magisterial bench, the chairman. addressed tbeain a verylengthened and appropriate speech, adverting to the brave conduct of the gallant seamen before him in saving huran life at the immninent peril of their own, and especially to the circumstances connected with the wreck Of the Northern Belle.

Something, ltowever, as i seems, may be expected from the female character itself, which never, even in the lowest stge of deterioration, loses a its pecular tenderness. An instance has been known of tio of theloWest clas of prosti. tutes bcinging a young girl, who hadjust eched the crisis spoken of, to a house ot refuge, 'ad after ascertainin, that she Was earea for returning again to the life they could not bulkabhor, A paralel.ease, fouLnded proUbaby upon an actual fact Wil Occur toth6 resAders of Doavid rfed 'The matter hsas been taken up) by the Parishioners of St. James's, becuse Ia this paiLsh is bontcentratd a' larg pro.' portion of the profliga of the metropplis-that Is, almost hithe wel- e en women in i ondon are attracted hiter by the large dancig salOOns And other places of questionable resot, whicer abound nowhere more ghlainn this zezghbosrhod andl by the fashionable charter of the Princip stremea.

The eta will creep higher, until the whole community bOeomes corrupt. For this reason, andl becanse many or most of these women come from other parts of London and of the kingdom, the parishioners of St. Jamess think thoy have a rigbt tappeal to the country in general for support. This3 satat affair, ot onlyme. troplitan, much less parochial, heripnse a is tohre two or three rooms somewhere in this parish to rerveos a "ref e of this ems nec2ian f oie; for the rnesepti of appcants, another a bedrooma to racmmodate siuch ashaould bapply at AD hour too, ate to trandser them into theo ountry; also to purchae and fit up ahose in the Country, ner to London, as a "home" lhrge enough to accommodate between 20 and 30psenitents, I ut only fitted up, at loet for tho first two years, for about half that number, treating the ristition at the outset as an experiment, yot giving it, if suocessfl,b roomt ro sToet cover hallsin expense rdinary and extraordinary, the sum of 2,001. wil be requred on the instant, the an- ual expenditure being est mae at about 150W. more.

I this need, however, perhaps the most effectual resource of all would be emigrtion. Nothing alters the character and life so i:stantaneously and completely as a new start ix a new conatry. It cannot be denied that there are objections to, a sehesne of this kind, too many and too serious to be slated even much less to be answered within the limits to which I shaU endeavour to eonfine thi lotter. As they ar likely, however, to suggest themselves to many amnong your readers, and as they have already had the effbet of deterring several chaitably disposed persons from giving their aid to this project, will *.a}e them aHlogether sad sum them up Tery biefly as follows:-This is an evil inherent in human nature, which it wereain totryanderadicat The supply is regulated by the demand. Subtract a certain number of perses, asitwere, fromthe market, and their plae wi be dby others; so that you do not only do nif nctims, but you acitually extend the area of demoralization. You enoourage vioe by alleviating the disastrous consequences of it At present a large number of persons of both sexes are deterred, the one from seducing, the other from being seduced, by the tremendous penalties which are attached to the loss of virtue in women.

One synonyme for the loss of virtue is " r&-nrin in its widest sense, a blackened name, blasted prospects, an imperilled eternity..

Emigraioni, afteraU, a doubtful issource, at loet for women of a spoerior cUls. The demand in the colonil is rtber for tho, who are seoutomil to rough, hard work. Finally, why naltiply establiahments of this natare ? If it be de3irable to ty such an experiment as this at all, a great deal of expee would be savea by making the reformitory!for womean. a Slprior grade merely a departmeant of xome ole of the eriWm&gaitenhtiArIe3. Tothe objections it may be answered that this isg, attenpt to perfe:t human nature, bat simply to improve it; to rdlezMe sin to a distance; to confine a natural in- tinct within legitimate boondd It is not trae that the supply is, at 1b33t in London, exactly equal to the demand. On %he contrary-aud this is a notioeable fact-it is redOLndant and crestes the demand. It is notorious that a Igige number of 1oung men who come to -Lndon from the eonnt, prhape for the dttimte, are not so mueet eduters as SWduMe. Withdraw a erWtin number of the one sex ftom the profenion of MIfamy and you remove just so much, of danger which is at Psent plaeed in the way ef the other.

EQUALMATION OF 2HE POORR-BATES. TO TEiE EDITORj OF TIE TIMES. Sir,-The atention of the public-thbans to the abll ad. vooacy of Mhe Times and the prem generally-being' now fully aroused to,the imporknoe of aaequal, rating for the neoessities of thie Liondon poor, it may-not be out of plaoe to enumeatea few of the moral andodil bonefits lwhich may be expected to emanate from the equalization. The present systm istheproductiveparent of many ovil It keeps alive and fosters among puaohial offloerg a spiit of selfishness which is utterly at variance with the spirit oC Christianity; the kIndest feelings of the kindest mqn are soon blunted by the ternness of official instmotions,: anc the epithet of "haid.ihrtid' is proverbially appied to that officer whose duty it is to ovarlook the poor. The latter by the present system are driven about from pllir to post, in order to avoid expense to the individual paishes, till some of theta, like Emily Stokes, whose lamentable casa is reported in 2%C Tims to-day, are tempted by muh inhumanity to seek relief in msicide. Every effort Is made by. the lrge proprietors of the wealthier parishes to pulVdowza the habitations of those who are likely to become charge,_ able, to lear them out and drive them into other districts, where they are compelled, from want of room, to herd together in the most promiscuous and indeoent manner, to the evident detriment of. what little moral sense is left to them. Physial and moral evil of the worst chruacter ig tie in. evitable result of this overcrowding; and it would be well for those who humanely seek to benefit the poor by ths erection of model houses for their occupation to examine carefully the cause of a great portion of this evil; it wilt be foundto bethe selishness oftherich drivingtem out from paishes where they might have room to brathe to others where they are denied the blessing. The overwhelming amount of pauperis which nowv prosses upon the poorer parishes, thus enemnbered by the evictions of the richer ones, necessarily eompels the officilal of those paishes to dole out the smallest possible amounk of relief to those whohave a legaclaimupoet them,-to give' them on7 I&s and a loaf per welek, wkich is not enough to keep soul and body together. Indeed, if adequate relief were afforded to the poor of such a district as this, the rates, instead of being 5e., would be Os, or 12s. in the pound. The effect which this cruelty has upon the poor is to mako thera discontented with their lot, to repine at the dispensations of Providence, and to hate their richer brethren. It makes them ever ready to listen to the harages of the political demagogae, and to be led on to sedition and crime by scheming and designing men. They feel persuaded that the rich do not care for their welfare, but only for their own enjoyment, ald a feelisg of hostility is generated between classes which are mutually dependent upon each other, and whose mutual interest itis to live, together in amity and Christian kindness Now, if the rate were equalized, the whole of these evils would be obliteraed. The spirit of selfishness which nowr exists between different parishes would die out at once, be. calse the interests of all would be- identisaI, ani one could not then gain any advantage by the oppession of another The poor starving outcast would then be- admitted into the nearest workhouse without hesitation or delay, becausa there would be no motive for refosal. The wealthier parishes, knowing that they must pa;j; their equxl share oF the burden of the poor, wouM cease to be-auxiou&for their expulsion; the evils of oversowdingmwould be lessened, the financial board, or whoever had tie umaaagemet-of tho funds, would be able to coMirbute to. tho arectioa of model dwellings and so meetthe views of sanitW reformers.

A better spirit .f mutual kindness woula prevail between tho upper-and 4ho lower classes, and harmony would exist whern nothing now is seen but disword. and dia. affection. And then, if atany time any partioular trde or ocupation should be reduced to distress from want of work or any other cause, tvow easy would it be for a rate of ld. in the ound to be levied in aid of emigration, or some other rema. 9is.

LONDON, WEDNIESDA Y, MAY 6, 1857. It would be afectation not to own some sort of uneasiness at the news that the United States are going to carry it with a high hand over the miseral1le State of New Granada. The old cock does not like to see the young cock strutting and crowing so mear his own dunghill. But, though we care little for New Granada or Central America in this country, and have other things to think of, there is abundant provocation to instinctivejealousy. First, there is one of the most important points in the world apparently involved in the affair, that Bimaris Corintthus of the New World,Panama, more important than the Istbmus of Suez, or any other great meeting-point of nations. It seems to be marked , nature for the common property of mankind, as much as the oceans which it so slightly dissevers. It is true that to all appearance it may-be hundreds of years before we shall ever make much use of fhe Isthmus, and during all that time the United States will be more concerned to invite than to obstruct our pasage. But there is the apparent Matural right; and in this case it is secured and embodied in a treaty, about which there happens to have been some controversy. Then we have in this country a rather exaggerated idea of Brother JONATRA&'S disposition to take the law into his own hands. The most outrageous incidents and the most offensive speeches are they that come quickest and are most repeated in this country. We have heard of Lynch law; we have read Uncle Tom; our diners-out have aU of them a few bits of "stump" oratory to amuse the ladies with; and so we have a prevailing idea that the will of a Yankee is his only law. Yet the more we know oI the Americans the more satisfied are we of their resemblance to ourselves. They are, perhaps, a little more fiery, a little more independent, for climate and circumstance will tell upon them; but the " governing classes" of the United States are the very near descendants-the grandchildren or the great grandchildren-of our own yeomanry, and inherit the same strong elements of their character. Compared with the great interests of humanity any jealousy we might feel of American progress is, we frankly admit, a petty consideration. It certainly is for the interest of humanity that civilization, in the common sense of that word, comprising order, I security of life and property, hospitality to strangers, and permanent institutions, should prevail over disorder, anarchy, continual revolution, and mutual massacre, and the general state of things described in almost every letter from Central and a great part of South America. The mongrel races that people those regions combine the vices of barbarism with those of civilization, and under the names, and exteriors, and political pretensions of the Spanish Hidalgo or Republican, qe, in fact, as turbulent, cruel, and intractable as. ;he races supplanted by their forezathers. But^no country ever had peace in which were various, races that refused to coalesce, and there is wanting that esssential condition to order in Central America. What changes may be effected by the new element now introducing itself time only can show ; but, as things now are, there cannot be peace and order in Central America, nor will there be till a stronger hand, a more vital principle of order, comes in. No doubt that wiU be supplied by the United States. It is true-aand here we are involuntarily reverting to our first misgivings-we in this country neither know nor can learn the rights of the quarrel between the States and Granada. The Americaps allege a conspiracy, but nothing is more unlikey than a concerted scheme by the population of a weak State to get up an inexpiable feud with one infinitely stronger. It had al the look of illfeeling, accident, and passion, like an Irish faction fight, only fought out with knives and rifles instead of clubs and stones. But it is not our business to decide, or to form any opinion as to the origin of the quarel. What we have to consider rather is the bearing of the affair on the general interests of humanity. Now, between such people as the citizens of the United States and the mixed populations of Granada, the former in the apparently weak position of strangers and traveUers, yet each representing in his own person the whole power and genius of a mighty commonwealth, and the latter really contemptible, but in possession of the spot, there could not bat be continual ruptures. It is only a question of time. If the outbreak was not this year it would be the next. Of course, it would be far better that the State of Granada should be strong enough to keep its people in order, and to prevent them from taking a tumultuous revenge for personal imults; but if every collision between resident and traveller is to be followed by a rising of the rwhole population, then. Granada becomes a mere mine of explosive ingredients, which it is dangerous to walk over. A traveller may anuwer for himself, but he cannot answer for the 500 travellers who may be with him at the port or on the passage, and the world at large has the right to demand some security that one of its great thoroughfares shall not be made a scene of mutual carnage every time a drunken traveller misconducts himsBef. Bat, in fact, neither the United States, nor England, nor any other Government has so much voice in these changes as we are apt to assign to them. The change will take place, and all that statesmen and philanthropists can do reaches only to the time and the manner. A vast population -Anglo-Saxon we call it, for want of a better name, but much more British than Anmerican-is pouring into these regions, and acquiring that strength which is inseparable from superiority of numbers and breed. Nothing will prevent them from gaining the ascendancy over the debased races that decay, languish, quarrel, and destroyone another in one of the finest countries as weU as most commanding situations in the world. There they are, and, though the gold discoveries of Australia have dliverted from California and the routes thereto the great European influx with which they were threatened, still the "Anglo-Saxon" element is rapidly increasing in Central America and growing to its invariable political development. Whatever the Government of the United States does in these regions will be better than the work of adventurers, which, at the best, wil be only a broken limb badly set, and will require some day another and more painful operation. The only point at present involved in this quarrel is the country immediately about the Isthmus. The Government of Washington will consult its own peace, at all events its resources, by advancing as little as possible southwards into the State of Granada -a vast mountainous region directly under the Equator. We presume that, at the utmost, it will confine its ambition to the perfect security of its route to the Pacific States. Time may or may not caU it or tempt it to the path of PIZARRo and into the heart of that southern continent, which has never yet known repose. But for the present the States can do little more, and can desire little more, than to substitute their own authorities for those which have been foumd ineffectual at the Isthmus. Even if we frequented the region much more than we do we should have but small reason to regret the change, andc can only desire that it should take place as quietly as possible.
We are at war-or, at least, we were so a few weeks ago-with a nation which represented the mightiest empire in the world at the time when the earliest profane history was written,-with a people who still live in tents upon the produce of their flocks and herds, who still serve for their wives as in the days of the patriarchs, and whose public works date from the time of the Prophet DANm. These people, once such redoubtable soldiers as to overthrow the great monarchy of Babylon, are the hardieet race of Asia even to the present day. They can subsist where a camel might almost starve, and perform such marches as modern troops would never dream of attempting. Their artillery is well organized and effective; and they can rely, besides, on the strength of a country which presents the ramparts of a vast natural fortress on every side open to our approaches. The collision of such a people with the forces of one of the great Powers of Europe ofers a curious spectacle of contrasted advantages, but the ultimate balance, as might be anticipated, is aU on the side of civilization. The utmost that Sir HEuNRY RAwLINSOX could say for the Persians in his interesting lecture the other day was, that it might take 40,000 or 5.0,000 of our soldiers te force the passes of their country, and his conclusion on behalf of both natiOn3 was, that we could not do better than give them our protection, or they than accept it) The times are past when the destinies of Europe could be influenced by conquerors from the Asiatic highlands, nor would Peraia possess much importance in the eyes of the Western Powers except for I the territories which lie beyond it. But further to the East is the Indian Empire of Britain, aud between India and Persia are interposed only the unsettled and lawless tribes of Beloochistan and Cabul. Neither Affghans nor Beloochees represent any organized Power, but Persia, to the resources of a vigorous and martial population, can at least add the strength of monarchical institutions and the support of a regular, though feeble, Government. Unfortunately, we can only operate coercively upon the Court of Teheran at the cost of a tedious and difficult expedition ; but, on' the other hand, we can offer the most obvious community of policy, for nothing can be more in accordance with our interest than that Persia should be strong, prosperous, and independent. It is to us, indeed, that much of 'her present strength is actually owing. The Persian army is in many respects effective simply because some years ago- we took the trouble to makb it so. It is British organization which is visible in its artillery and its battalions, and prudence therefore, no less than humanity, should impel us to escape as soon as possible from the necessity of demolishing our own work. The object of the recent contest is, in a moral, no less than a material sense, astonishingly remote. As Persia intervenes between Russia and India, so another country intervenes between India and Persia; and, as we wish that Persia should bo independent, so we wish that Cabul should be more independont still. One of the most valuable strategic positions in the territories of Cabul is Herat, a city which might be almost as fabulous as El Dorado if zieges had not made it almost as famous as Troy. It is hard to say under -what governmen~ Herat is to be left, but it is not to be under the government of the Persians, and they have under, taken to evacuate it accordingly. Herat, howevee, is so far from Teheran, Teheran is so far fro*t General OuTRAMe'S position, and this position is so far from everywhere else, that much time mnust inevitably elapse before the stipulations which have been now agreed upon can be carried into execution. All that can be hoped for is, that the tidings of the pacification may arrive at the seat of war in time to prevent unnecessary bloodshed, and that the stations of our troops may be so arranged that the effects of the climate may be avoided. The actual state of affairs at the date of our last intelligence was such as to admit of one or two different contingendes. The British General, as our readers are aware, was conducting an expedition from Bushire against Mohammerah; but the Persians in the meantime were not inactive. The army defeated by our troops at Xhooshab had been largely reinforced by another column, under a new commander, who was bringing, it is said, into the field against us some of the best of the battalions in the service of the SHAH. It was not very probable, however, that he would expose himself readily to the disasters which signalized the tactics of his predecessor, for he is reported to possess some military abilities, and to have the advantage of European assistance on his Staff. But it is clear that his operations may possibly modify General OuT&3es plans, and that it may be thought advisable rather to return and encounter the Persian force in the vicinity of Bushire than seek out our antagonists at Mohammerah or in the country beyond it. 3Iohammerah itself is only an insignificant collection of mud huts, but it represents, as we have described on former occasions, a p'osition from which an advance may be made towards a more vulnerable part of the country. What desarves remark is, that the Persians must have been quite as well aware of this fact as ourselves, for they anticipated such a movement by occupying the position in considerable strength and extemporizing some respectable defences. Mohammerah has none of the features of a fortified town, but just behind it an intrenched camp has been established, in which it is surmised that some ]0,000 troops have been collected to resist our advance. We only hope the expected collision may be averted by the timely arrival of the courier with the intelligence of peace. Apart, however, from any of those obstacles which the valour of the British troops may be relied upon to surmount, we shall, no doubt, encotunter difficulties of a very different description in securing the results which have been kept in view. The great object in contests like this is to impress the enemy effectually with an idea of the superiority which attends civilization, and yet this is precisely the impression which it seems most difficult to leave. With such antagonists as we encountered at Khooshab the least hesitation, however judicious, is taken as a certain sign of weakness, and even victoryis metamorphosed a few days afterwards into the semblance of defeat. The intelligence which reaches us represents it as positively a fact that we are believed to have had decidedly the worst of it in Genera! OuTrI7Sis last expedition. Nobody cares to talk about the overthrow of the Persian squares by a handful of cavalry-indeed, there were not many left to tell that tale; but inasmuch as, after capturing the enemy's camp at Boorazjoon and destroying his stores, we deliberately marched back again to Bushire, instead of advancing into the mointains, our return is called a retreat, and this retreat is made to cover all the other features of the campaign. The embarrassment iA a curious one, and it is hard to see how it can be escaped; but perhaps it may serve to increase our caution for the future in getting such affairs upon our hands. Here is an enemy whose army, according to the excellent authority of Sir EENRY RAwLnaSON, is so ill fed, ill clothed, and ill commanded that, notwithstanding the goodness of its raw material, it could never oppose European troops, least of all British troops, in a field of battle. It has no commissariat, and the pay of the soldiers is frequently five or six years in arrear. Yet, in despite of all this weali±ess, the Persians contrive to give us trouble enough. If they only keep out of the way it is exceedingly hard to get at them, and, if they come out to be beaten, the victory is of so little use a fortnight afterwards as to be carried actually to their own side of the account. These are not easy conditions of war, and, though we cannot evade the obligations of empire, the fewer contests we get into on such terms the better will it be for us.
We insert in another column a letter on the subject of a new "Refuge" for an unfortunate class of women, about to be set up in the paxiiN of St. James. We need not go into the details of the scheme. In common with the rest of the world, we are glad to see anything whatever done to relieve these poor creatures. We are not disposed to criticize very accurately. The evil is a terrible one, and we welcome anything like a remedy. But, while we wish well to every effort of this kind, we must warn these benevolent reformers against one unwholesome tendency of such schemes, and that is, that the aim at relief is apt to supersede the aim at prevention. They become so absorbed in the facts of misery before their eyes that they cease to search for causes. And yet the cause is the most important part of the matter; because, if we can put our finger upon that, and if we can find it to any extent remediable, a remedy for the cause is an incomparably greater discovery than any relief to the particular cases as they arise. Prevention is better than cure. " Yea, if you can prevent," it will be replied, perhaps, " but that is impossible-it is out of the " question. You cannot deal with the evil in its " cause; it is simply the corruption of human "nature, which you cannot remove ; you can only "remedy the evil in the individual case as it arises." But this is exactly the way of arguing that we are now meeting. This is just the point of view I which, as we have said, these remedial schemes are apt to produce, and which is not a right one. People acquire by their very zeal and laudable activity in such schemes this exclusive attitude toward the evil. Their interest becomes too much like that which attaches to a sick-room or a chamber of horrora,-the evil excites horror, disgust, compassion, alarm; its very magnitude interests the mind. Indeed, great social evils, like ghosts, or comets, or eclipses, or the misfortunes of our friends, create a kind of morbid interest not altogether unplessurable. But it is plainly fanatical to yield wholly to feelings of this kind, andlook upon a great social evil as if it were simply a horrible spectre, which came across us we did not know how, or why, or whence. We live in a system of causes and effects. Is there any cause for this evil in the working of any part of our system? If there is, people must think it no harm to look out for secular remedies. Is there any mistake or defect in the training of girls in this country, which, somehow - or other, has the effect of bringing them up in crowds to the metropolis, overstocking by thousands the department of needlework, reducing wages to a mere fraction, and thus throwing a multitude of poor starving creatures upon vice for their support? If there is, we shall be doing a great deal more good by altering that mistake of training, to begin with, than by correcting-if such poor mitigation as we can give can be called correctionthe disastes -which reulit from it. If there is any such mistake in the training of girls, society is deeply and religiously responsible for th rectification of it, so far as it is possible; and it is a very poor compensation for the neglect of this duty to relieve the suffering which this neglect produces. It is false religion-it is not religion at all, but morbid sentiment-to like curing better than preventing,-to be in the first instance insensible and indifferent to the amount of temptation- which you throw upon people, and then to overpower them with your interest and solicitude when they have fallen. Our correspondent says, alluding to the enormous number of this unfortunate class in the metropolis,-" It is not "true that the supply is, at least in Lon"don, exatly equal to the demand; on the "contrary-and this is a noticeable fact--it is "redundant, and creates the demand." Wel, but, if this is the case. this fact of itself shows that there must be some cause in operation besides mere vice to account for the largeness of this class. Let us see, then, if we can make out what this cause is. Now, when we examine our system of training for girls of the poorer clas, we see one very important defect immediately in it, and that is that they receive no instruction in household work. Girls are taught sewing in our parish schools, and very properly, because, even with a view to domestic service, sewing is an important accomplishment; but they are not taught anything about household work. We do not say that a parish school could teach this, for houxehold work can only be realy learnt in a house; the schoolroom can provide napkins andc towels, but it cannot supply tables, chairs, mantlepieces, and carpets for rubbing and brushing; and, the material to work upon being wanting, the art cannot be taught. But this is only explaining the fact, and not altering it. Household work is not learnt, and what is the consequence ? The department of domestic service in this country is hardly at this moment sufficiently supplied, while crowds of girls enter into the department of needlework in one or other of its branches, and of course overstock it enormously. Add to this a sort of foolish pride that poor people have in the apparent rise which is gained in rank by this. profession,-for, of course, every one of these girls is ultimately to be " a milliner," which has for them rather a grand sound. The metropolis, sooner or later, receives this vast overplus of the sewing female population, and the immense milliners' and tailors' and shirtmakers' establishments hardly absorb the overflowing supply of female labour and kfill, while, of course, they profit to the very utmost by the glut of the labour-market. A vast multitude of half-starving women is the result of the system; whereas, had household work formed a part of their instruction, besides a better supply of the home field of service, what is of much more consequence, the colonies would take a large part of this overplus off our hands. The last Australian blue-book shows the demand there is for female labour of this kind in our colonies. Had these women any notion of household work, they would form exactly the class of emigrants which is vranted in Australia, and which our colonists there are constantly writing to the Colonial-office for, expressing the greatest disappointment at not getting them. It may be that women of such a class would very soon marry when they were sent out to our colonies. So they might, but no one could quarrel with such a result; nor would disappointment at the short enjoyment of their services diminish the demand for successors from the same quarter. In this way the redundancy of female labour in this country would be eased, and the great metropolitan establishments could no longer despotically command the underpaid services of a large class which ekes out a miserable weekly pittance by the profits of vice. What is the natural remedy, then, for this defect in the training of girls of the poorer classes in this country? The remedy is, of course, that they should be taug,ht in some way or othc' household work. At present, in the absene of any such instruction as this, it must be ,zdmitted that, however incidentally, the sewi'i7 which is taught in all our parish schools is simply aiding the overflQwing tie of needle labour, which is every year taking up such multitudes of young "women to the metropolis, and exposing them to the dreadful temptations of an underpaid service. And how is household work to be taught? Well, that is, of course, the difficulty. There are, as we have said, great difficulties in the way of our parish schools talking it up. The experiment, however, has been tried, in different places, of special institutions for this object; and, in the absence of any formal and public institutions, the houses of our gentry and clergy might be made to supply such instruction to a considerable extent, and without any inordinate demand on private charity. Extra labour, as every householder knows, is often wanted in every domestic establishment; it is even wanted periodically and at regular intervals in a large proportion of our good houses. It would be of great service to the country if a practice, which is already partially adopted, were more common and general-that of taking parish girls by turns for these special oecasions. This might be done, at any rate in the country, to a large extent, and even a few days' employment of this kind in a well-furnished house, occurring at more or less regular intervals, 'woui be often enough to create a taste and a capacity for householdwork. The profession of household service might thus be indefinitely widened, and a large class be created that would naturally look to such service as its distinct employment, and be ready, in case of disappointment at home, to seek it in the colonies.

MR. COBDEN. Mr. Alexander LAing, manufacturer, Eawidc, has received the following letter from Mr. Cobden, in acknowledgment of a copy of resolutions passd at a public meeting in that toW3, ympathizing with Mlessrs Cobden, Bright, and Gibson on their recent defeats at Huddersijeld and Manchester _ "M -idhurst, April 30. Sir,-I have had the honour of re3eiving your t enclosng rslutions pised ata pablic meeting in ;H declaing its attachment to those general views which , conjunction with mJyfiends Mewr. Bright and Gibhon I have advocated, and expreing 'tt rert at the reult of the Manchegter and Xudderleld elections. Pray do meo the favour to assure your kind neighbour that- I appreciAte with grteful warmth this generous markoftheir approbation. To be cheered with the sympathy of ose's countrymen in moments of discourgement or defeat Is the most gratifying reward andthe most useful support that cm be rendered to a public man. "It is, however, but just to all parties to add ithat far more hus been implied from my accidental defeat at Huddersfield thin can be fAirly attributed to it. I had *ooQn. nexion with or claim on tiat borough, and no acquaintance with its inhabitants beyond that which I formed in almost every oonsiderable place in the kidngdom in the coDe of the fr trade struggle; and Mr. Akroyd, the elected 3ember, is as sound a freetrader as myself. The inTitation' become a candidate, which emanated from a public meeting, did not reach metill atter my opponent, who ocepied an influential local position, was already in the mist of a cnvaus from door to door throughout the borough -an otdeal which I at once declared I could not -go through-for all the setain-Tarlianment-sandhis suce was insured against all possible opposition, no matter from what quarter it might have come. In fact, my entrance upon the contest ws at the time simply and solely a mitake; bt, owingtothecircumstanoes under which it wasfalleinto, Itinvolvedno blame or serious responsibUitytoany one, I should not presume to think these particulars worEdsof being mentioned but for the impresion which I se prevAils that ] deet myself sgpleved at the resut of the contest,. and regard it as a deliberate judgment of a popular stituency on my political principles. The electors of Hiddersfield were not reularly or fairly empannelled a a jery to try me, and theirverdict could not therefore invviv elther credit or discredit to mUe or themselves. "To complete, sinco I have commenced this little xaaetlve, let me add that the read cause of my finding myel at this moment out of the Howie is to be traced as far boc ;as 1847, when, owing to the over-zealouw Idnnes of my friend Iwas, while LOO miles distaut from England, returned for both the Wes' Riding and Stockport. On 1ay return home, at the urgent ro%uest of those friends, I riduc. tautly dissolved my oonnenon with the borough, and elected to sit for the Riding. I should have been but a cold-blooded pohtician if I had acted otherwie, But I had a full foresight of the consequnces, for I wasthe first to declare that it would be impossible, a6fter the free trade question was tted, that the largest county eosituency in the kingdom should continue to be represeted by one wholly unconnected with it by birth, property, or rsdenoe. I acoepted its representation ad hoc, as the diplomatists would sy, knovwing that in witbdrawing myself from the safe anchorage of Stockport I was endangering my return at some future election by castine myself adrift amid the storms and breakers of the politic ocean. The result has only verified my predictions But let it not be supposed that Iam so unreasonable as to feel aggrieved by the result. I should be about the last man living to be justified in giving.way to sueh a feeling. I haver-had -more tban my share of the honours of political warfare, and why should Iexptto escape iht reverses? "lorpetsonal reaons itisconvenient to Meat present to be relieved from the duties of Parliament. I must confess, however, at the same time, that there never was a moment when, on publie grounds, Iwould have more gladly taken my seBt in the House of Commons. Again thanking you and those whom you represent for your friendly manifestations of feeling, "I remain, Sir, yours faithfuly, " RICIARD COBD1W. "Alexander IlAing, Esq., Hawick. "P.S. Iregret that in consequence of your first letter having failed to reach me there should have been so much delay n sending an answer." At a meeting of the Catholic electors of ILeeds, held at the rooms of the Catholic Literary Institution on the ITch of April, it was -unanimously resolved that the following address be presnted to Mr. Richard Cobden " We, the Catholic electors of the borough of Leeds, entertaining a grateful recollection of the many and successful services rendered by you to the great principles of civil and religious liberty throughout your brilliant career in Parlia. ment, and by the influence of your name on the large ntmber of those who have espoused the liberal cause in England, feel it a duty imposed upon us by the preeeit crisis of publio affairs to render to you our most sincere and hearty thanks for the labours yon have undergone and the zeal you have displayed on behalf of that cause in which we, among many others, have so deep and important an interest. " Aware that, in opposing to the enemies of freedoum the great abilities which you possess, and the untring energy with which those talents havo been exercised, you have incurred obloquy and encountered prejudice by advocatinour claims to the rights of conscience, we feel that it would be a stigma on us as men and citizens, and that we should be justly esteemed unworthy of tbe assistance we have received from you, if we were to withhold this publio expression of our gratitude and sympathy. " In begging you, then, to accept the thanks we thus respectfolly tender to you, we desire at the same time to express our deep regret that by untoward circumstances we are deprived, for a time at leaS, of your vvaluable atd so freely given in our behallf, and that the country should lose the Parliamentary services fsget oneu,ads honest a man." s of so great, so ueful, and so The following is Mr. Cobden's reply to the address:- " Mldhurst, April 24, 1857. "Sir,-Your letter, enclosing a copy of a resolution agreed to by the Catholio electors of Leeds, has, after some delay, reacbed me here, and I have to beg you to be so good as to convey to them my grateful acknowledgments for their kindness, and to assure them that my gratitude is the warmer from the consciousness I feel that I am quite undeserving of this special mark of their favour. " It is true that I incurred some little obloquy in certain quarters by opposing the Ecclesiastical Titles BiU in 1851, but I did so in consistency with that principle of religious liberty which has always been the maxim of my political life, and which I apply alike to all denominatioDs. Had the measure affected the church government of the Wesleyan, the Independents, or the Baptists, I should have equ$; opposed it. That Bill was a resort to the civil power for penalties to prevent a religious community from carryin out an organization which they consider needful for the ful and free exercise of their faith-an organzation, be it remembered to our humiliation, which is in force in every other country, in sonie, as in Prussia, with the co-operatiox of the Government, and in others, as the United States, with its neutrality. Such a recourse to the secular arm in matters of opinion is to my judgment to return to the per. secuting policy of the dark ages; for whether we seek to thwart the free exercise of religious faith by the dungeon and the stake orby the milderpenalties of anBcclesiasticI Titles Bil, the principle is the same, modified though it be in its action by the spirit of the age. With these views strengthened by every day's reflectiou and experience, I beg to assure you and the respectable body of my fellowroountrymen who have done me theA honour to address me, that my humble support may,regard. less of consequeres to myself, be always reckoned upon for emaucipsting them from every vestige of religious disquali. fication or inequality to which they are unjusily sabjected and I remain, Sir, yours very sincerely, a " R COBDB9 N "7 JIrs, Esq., Cooper-house, lKirbataL"

THE OPENING OF THE [XHIBITION OF ART TREASURES AT MANCHESTER. (FROM OUR OWN REI'URIIMB.) Manchester was yesterday the scene of an event nlinost unique in the history of art in England, or prhaps in the world. Au Ethibition of Art Treaaures, never before equalled for extent and importance,was opened Nvith an 6cdat to which nothing but the presence of the Sovereign herself could have added. The Consort of Her Majesty presided over the ceremony, which was witnessed by a large and -distinguished assembly, comprising seyeral Cabinet Ministers, the representatives of various foreign -countries, many of our native nobility and gentry, the corporate authorities of some of our principal cities, and thousands of the inhabitants of the important and populous district of which Manchester Is the centre. The weather was most propitious, and -the arrangements both within and without the Exhibition were faultless. It was a day, in short, -of marked success, and one of which the city of M¢anchester may be proud. Success is not always a proof of labour, though as a general rule few successes are attained without it. Certainly the Art Treasares Exhibition has been no exception to the general rule. What has been bestowed upon it in gratuitous labour alone would have almost raised a pyramid. Its indefatigable managers have had to contend with difficulties of all kinds-scientific, naAural, artistic, mechanical, aud, though last not least, -crochety and impracticable people. Diligence alone would not have been sufficient to vanquish all the obstacles. To get ready the Palace Lby the appointed time requirel no slight effort, -Dnd even those nfoBt confident in the indomitable aDnergy of Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Deaue might latve been excused for doubting its feasibility. On the very evening before the opening sufficient re3nained to be done to dismay all but those connected with the Exhibition. Its aspect then, compared with the rich and tasteful appearance of yesterday morning, was quite chaotic. Masses of inlaid steel had tio be built up into warriors, armed cap-d-pie, with Vsor down and lance in rest. Antique weapons of <6centric form were to be placed in striking groups. Mliniatures were to be arranged, paintings hung, l -gilding and rich draperies substituted for benches, tools, and scattered shavings. Piles of wooden cases, from out of which white marble arms and nose3 peeped forth inquiringly, had still to be -opened, and their exquisite contents placed upon their pedestals, while the hangings, gildings, and decorations generally required to be completed. Almost all things, however, are possible to those who work, as the sailors say, "w with a will." The labour proceeded amid an indescribable din of ham. mers and saws and the sound of many voices, and as the eveniing approached the great display grew 2hourly towvards perfection of arrangement. It was found necessary to keep the men at work all night, Ibut with the exception of a few minor details all was completed in good time. Even as early as 6 o'clock Manchester began to be on the -stir for the great day. Punctuality is a virtue by sio means so much confined to Princes as people generally suppose. At all events, the outdoor sightseers appeared determined to err on the right side; and excursion trains from the districts round Man(chester began to set dowix their heavy loads even 'before Prince Albert had quitted London. Almost continuous streams swept along the roads from the various rail way stations, while vehicles of the most primitive description, packed like slave-ships, turned out of every lane and byway. No cart, how-ever ricketty, seemed to be thought unequal to the weight of six inside. This confidence in most -caes appeared to be justified, and until yesterday we never had a proper appreciation of what carts will hold and horses draw. At the Cheadle station of the London and North. -Western Railway as much preparation had been made for the reception of the Prince and his suite 'zs was possible on a few hours' notice. The station Is at Cheadle Hulme, more than two miles from Mhe village of Cheadle, and at the point of junction with the North Staffordshire line to Macclesfield and the Potteries. It is a very smaU Dne, and at present is in course of re-erection after -destruction by fire; but it was elaborately decorated for the occasion. The offices were adorned with evergreens, banners, and the Royal arms, and inscriptious breathing the customary affectionate -aspirations for the health and long life of the Sovereign and her family. The small covered platform on the opposite side, where his Royal Highness was to descend, was converted into a sort of pavilion, decked vwith a profusion of laurels and ivy, and with crimson and white drapery in festoons ,and panels. The ground was covered with acarlet cloth; the air was enlivened by a mulfitude of gay streamers floating at a great elevation, aud the bridges over which the two railways cross the road to Cheadle had put on as much ot the appearance of triumphal arches as they were able to assume in the limited time allowed for the purpose. Immense crowds of people had collected long lbefore the expected arrival, and a great number of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen were gathered on the station platforms and the numerous approaches, -or in vehicles placed at every point which afforded a view. Order was maintained by a detachmen; of the Cheshire Constabulary, under the charge of %Ir. Superintendent Andrews, from Stockport, and they afterwards dispersed themselves along the road 'by which the Prince and his suite proceeded to t11eadle. An escort of the 7th Dragoon Guards, under the command of. Lieutenant -Dowdeswell, was also in attendance at the station. On tlle spot were Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith, G.C.B., Commandant of the Midland Districts; Colonel Taylor, Adjutant-General; Mr. Atkinson, High-Sheriff of Cheshire, and his chaplain; and the Mayor and Town-clerk of Manchester. The Royal train, which left London at 6 20, arrived at the Cheadle station at 25 minutes past 11 o(clock, and Prince Albert descended amid the enthuaiastic cheering of the assem'bled multitude. His Royal Highness was immediately conducted by Mr. Watts, the Mayor of Manchester, to the carriage in waiting for him. His Staff consisted of Viscount Torrington, the Marquis of Abercorn, General the Hon. Charles Grey, Colonel Ponsonby, and Colonel Seymour. The carriages were at once formed in procession, and started o;f at a rapid pace. A number of vehicles followed to the Mayor's residence, a little beyond CDheadle, uhere Prince Albert was to remain about =n hour for rest and refreshment. Abney-bal], the reaidence of Mr. Watts, is a large and handsome mansion of red brick, with atone facings, in the early Tudor style of architecture. It is situated on the left or southern bank of the Mersey, about six miles from Manchester, and stands on a slight eminence, overlooking a richly wooded country. The grounds are not large, but teaI undulations of surface, the numerous plantations, I the lake, and a rivulet crossed by rustic bridge4, pre- uent such a variety of features as gives the imr2remion (a3 tomewhat considerable domain; and t;he house stself, with its noble conservatories aD d spacious Offices surrounding a large courtyard, f'orms a very extensive range of buildings. The whole of the lime of road from Cheadle BlSire to the Art Treasures Palace p:sented a TM anited appear¢nce. The nw"croa vi]lr,i 'Were thronged with people, and 8a gay as possible with festive decorations. Nearly all the privateresidences of the wealthier classes displayed a flag or some other sign of welcome in their front gardens, rnaay of which were filled with ladies and gentlemen anxious to catch a glimpse of the brilliant cowtge as it shot pastthem. At Cheadlethenumberof banners and streamers and the crowd of cheering spectator, made a mnost effective demonstration. At a little distance beyond the entrance to the grounds of Abney-hall was erected the first triumphal arch. It was covered with coloured drapery and evergreens, and presented a very tasteful appearance, being surmounted with a gilt crown, a profusion of small and brilliant banners, and bore in large letters on a ground of pink the inscription, " Albert, welcome to Cheadle." At the.entrance to Didsbury a beautiful rustic arch, composed almost entirely of evergreens, but decorated also with small banners, was erected opposite the Wesleyan College. The inscription here was *Welcome Prince Albert to the Art Treasures Exhibition." The long rows of cottages at Barlowmoor, adjoining Didsbury, displayed a great number of flags, and the footpaths and windows were all crowded with people. Here was another graceful arch of evergreens, in columns and festoons, with the inacription of "' Welcome, Prince Albert," and the letters " V. A." on each side. The same design, bat worked out with more elaboration, was reproduced in an arch at Withington. From Fallowfield, through Rushulme, to Manchester the road presented on either side an almost uninterrupted succession, for about two miiles, of suburban villas displaying banners or streamers, with groups of people at every window and on many of the roofs, all cheering the procession as it passed. The profusion of flags was everywhere very great, and at some places lines of them were stretched across the road. Passing the boundary of the city the crowds became very dense, and at the junction of Oxford-street with the Stretford-road, leading to the Exhibition Palace, the pressur was so exceasive as to render the preservation of order a task of no little difficulty. The procession, which left Abney-hall about 1 o'clock, was welcomed everywhere with enthusiastic cheers. It was formed at starting in exactly the same order as on leaving the Cheadle station, but after crossing the Mersey it was met and joined by the Earl of Burlington, Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire, and Mr. Charles Towneley, High Sheriff of Lancashire. The progress to the boundary of the city was very rapid. At that point the co;ige waa joined by the Lord Bishap pf Manchester, the staff of Sir Harry Smith, and the municipal authorities, most of whom appeared in full official costume. In Oxford-street the military escort received a greataugmentation fromatherem inder of the 7th Dragoon Guards under Coloiiel 13entinck; and as the procession increased in length its progress became much slower. 1Flrom Grosvenorsquare to Old Trafford-a straight line of road of considerably more than a mile in extent-the immense crowds of people who lined each side of the way, leaving only a narrow passage in the centre, rendered locomotion exceedingly difficult and dangerous, and thecort.qethenceproceeded atlittlermore than a walking pace. At various points along the Stretford-road were stationed large bodies from the societies of Odd Fellows, Druids, and Foresters, who contributed materially towards preserving the lines unbroken, and keeping the passage clear. The cheering, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, the banners and other decorations, the crowds on roofs and balconies, and immense wooden platforms erected on patches of ground otherwise unoccupied, formed an offering of hearty welcome such as has seldom been surpassed. All the avenues leading to the Exhibition building were closely blocked; various 6pen spaces in the neighbourhood were completely covered with masses of human beings, and the enthusiastic cheering of the populace when Prince Albert at length arrived at the Palace certified the public approbation of the important duty which had brought him to Manchester. The preparations which had been made for the ceremony within the building were of the simplest kind. The great central hall consists of a nave and two side aisles, and is intersected near its western extremity by the transept. A row of tall and slender columnn sparates the nave from each of the aisles, and the pillars are joined at the top by light and open girders, which carry the semi-circular roof of the nave. The side walls are hung with portraits of all the principal personages in English history and biography. Below them, on the floor, are arranged in handsome cases the multitude of objectainivory,wood, bronze, andtheprecious metals, which form the general museum of art. In front of the columns, and within the nave itself, on either side are placed a double row of statues, extending the entire length of the hall from the principal entrance to the transept, and leaving a broad passage or avenue in the centre. Near the transept the beautiful and elaborate suits of armour, from the Meyrick and other collections,are arranged in tasteful and appropriate groups. Beyond the transept the seats of the orchestra rise one over the other to a considerable height above the floor, terminating in a grand organ constructed by Messrs. Kirtland and Jardine, the elegant form and elaborate decoration of which fitly complete the view. For the proceedings of yesterday a dais was erected in the transept immediately in front of the orchtatra. It was octagonal in form, raised six steDs from the floor, and covered with red cloth. On the top was a square piece of rich tapestry, and there stood the chair of state in crimson velvet and gold used by Prince Albert during the ceremony. A tall Venetian mast rose on either side, from the point of which depended a banner, made in the one case of yellow and in the other of blue silk, and bearing the arms respectively of England and Gotha, with the mottoes, " Dies et mon droit," and " Trent and Fest." The Union Jack was displayed at various points in and near the transept, while at the back of the dais were seen the banners of different countries, with the names of great painters emblazoned on them. Behind the chair of state, and nearly on the same level with it, a number of benches, covered with green cloth and deco- rated with fringes, were arranged in a semicircle and reserved for the use of the more distinguished among the spectation. For the accommodation of the mass the whole of the central hall, with the exception of a passage in the centre, the galleries round the transept, and the two limbs of the transept itself, was furnished with rows of benches and cbairs. Abroad stripof scarlet clothran up the centre of thegreathallandheightened the effect of the white marble statues on either hand, throwing them out in beautiful relief. Fleven o'clock was the time fixed for opening the doors to the public, but long before that hour all the entrances were besieged by a large number of the rank, fashion, and beanty of Manchestor aud its vicinity. Thc, doors were opened gfetly to avoid a rush, and with oft-reiterated xaations from the inside for every one to take plenty of time. To such adxIce, of co-rse, no one pnia the slghtest regard. There was a good deal of pushing, and ladies scareLy got. that room to whieh they seemed to thixk their, capacious skirta entitled them. Some iUisja oa trying to move the turnstiles the vwrong way, wkjla others in their anxiety to get good plam would zot go right, no matter what amount el pains -were taken to guide them in their cowuse. Bai sfter the first rush all went as saotbly as could be wished, and showed the airangementa to have been well planned and executed. From tbe aomeAb the doors were opened, t-he steady inAtux, of visitors never ceased or slackened. Among the occupants of the green benches behind the dais were maly membera of both Houses of Parliament. Lord Broughton wore the uniform of a Lord-Lieutenautt, and LordWrottesley was also in uniform. The Marquis of Clanricarde and Earl Powis were also present. The Marquis of Stafford, the Earl of Burlington, Lord Eleho, Mr. Miangles, Mr. Grogan, Mr. Hankey, Mr. Kershaw, Mr. Hindley, and Mr. Beresford HIope represented the Houe of Commons. The American, Belgianl, end Haytiall Min iters were the only members of the corps diplomat quFe present. The Lord MIayors of London and Dublin, the former accomnpanied by Aldermen Copelnd, Salomons, and Cubitt, and by Sheriffs Mechi and Keats, were there in their robes of office. The Corporation of Manchester took a prominent part in the proceedings of the day. The Mayor of Salford, wearing a plain but exceedingly massive gold chain round hi neck, was a spectator of the ceremony. So also was the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. The corporate authorities in their crimson robee, and attended by their servants in gorgeous liveries, formed, indeed, not the least brilliant part of the spectacle. At 1 o'clock the Lord-Lieutenant of Treland, accompanied by his staff, entered the building, and after that hour but few visitors of note arrived. The Palace was crowded in every nook, and it may well be supposed that the scene was most animated and magnificent. Many of the gentlemen were in uniform or Court dress, while Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed with more taste and splendour than some of the ladies. Their dresses of the richest stuffis vied with the colours of the rainbow in variety and brilliancy, making the ornaments of the talla look mean and dull by comparison. The elegant proportions of the building itself, its chaste and beautiful decorations, the masterpieces of art scattered in rich profusion on every hand, the presence of 10,000 perons gaily attired, and the display of silken banners and standards combined to form a picture such as has rarely been witnessed even in the metropolis. The arrival of the Prince at the Exhibition was announced to those -within by the firing of a salute. His Royal Highness was received at the prncipal entrance by Lord Overstone, President of the General Council, by the chairman and members of the Executive Committee, and by MIr. Deane, the General Commissioner. The Duke of Newcastle, the Duke of Argyll, Earl Granville, the Lord-Lientenant of Ereland, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Sir Benjamin Hall, the Hon. Mr. Cowper, and Mr. Massey, mot of whom wore the Windsor uniform, here joined the suite of the Prinee, who 'was conducted in the first instance, amid great cheering, to the stato reception-room. After the lapse of one or two minutes his Royal Highness reappeared, and advanced to a smlMl temporary dais which had been erected at the lower end of the great oentral haiL The Mayor of Manchester, accompanied by nearly all the members of the corporation, then approached the Prince and read to him the following address:- ", May it please your Royal Hlghness,-We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of the city of Manchester, gladly avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the vist of your Royal Highness to renew the expreselon of our reprd foryour Royal Highness, and of our admiration of the many publio and private virtes by which your Royal Hligneas is eminently distinguished. 4" We offer to your oRyal Highness our most hearty con. gratuiations on the recent safe and auspicious birth of a Princess,a nnd we fervently pray that the valuable life of Her Most Grcious Majety, happilypreserved, may bhelong continued to be, as heretofore, a bleing to her family and her people. "While we refer with pride to the occasdon which has induced your Royal Highness to revisit our ciy, w e feel imperatively caled upon to express our warmest gratitude to your Royal Highnes for having cordla caseteM to honour by yeur preeae the opening of the magnificent building in which we stand, raised by the publio spirit and spontaneous liberality of our fellow-citizens for the reception of many of tho priceless trasres of ancient and modern art exiting in the united kingdom. "We rejoicoe in the complete suocess which has attended the efforts of those upon whom the responsibility o this undertaldng has devolved-a success which has exceeded the most sangaine anticipstions, and which we attribute mainly to the condescending and zealous patronage graciously extended by our beloved Sovereign. IThe encouraging example afforded by Her Most Gracious Majesty and your Royal Highnes in thus waloudy sup. portinganexhibition originating in a desire to instruct and gratify the peoplo has been emulated in the noblest spirit of liberality by the possessors of art teares throughout the kingdom, and the promoters have thus boen en bled to congratulate themselves on the splendid realization of their purposes which Is presented in the imposing spectale around us. "As representatives of the vaspopulation by whom we are surrounded, we venture most respectfuly to asure your Royal Highness that we hai with the greatest joy and satisfaction the intimation that it i9 the graious intention of Her Majesty the Queen to honour the exhibition with Royai visit. "We specily rejoice in the hope of this event, as affording another opportunity of evincing the deep and universal feeling of loyalty and attachment to oer MAjesty's person which prevails within and around this city, and the profound sense of gratitude which exist for the ca-e and solicitude very grciously manifested by our beloved Queen in favour of whatever is calculated to secure and promote the improvement and happinemss of Her Majesty's subjects. " That your Royal EHighness may be long spared to secure and increase the happiness of our Most Gracious Queen, and to be a blessing to your children and to the nation, is our most fervent prayer. " Given under the common seal of the corporation this 29th day of April, 1857." His Royal Highnea retum ed the following reply:- "Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Gentlemen,-I have re ceived with feelings of no ordinary gratification the address which you have presented to mue, expressing such kindly feelings towards myself, and professing to represent the good wishes of the vast community which is collected in and around this city. " It will, I am sure, be most pleasing to the Queen to re. ceive, from the expressionscontained inthe address, a fresh assurance of±the loyal interest taken by her people in all that concerns her hzppiness. " I most wiflingly attend here this day to assist ata cere - mony which the inhabitants of Manchestermaywell witness with pride, as its object is to inaugurate an Exhibition collected by the exertion of their enterprise and public spirit, and intended, not for the amusement and gratification of the neighbourhood alone, but for the ihstruction and improvement of the nation at large. " You justly tllude in terms of graitude to that coraprehensive and liberal spirit which has adorned the wallsof this building with the choicest specimens of art from, so many private galleries of the kingdom. It added much to. the pleasure with which the Queen and yyself had complied with the application for works of art beloeging to us. when we found this example so generally fofowed by the possessors of treasures which are, in gcneal so reluctantly entrusted by their owners to the are of others. " The Qaoen will, I am confident, be glad agai to- T& Manchester, not only to mark by her presence hea approva of the objet and successful executin of this pn t undertaking which we have this day t.. eelebrate, but. from a recollection of the enthusiastici loyalty exhibited when she had formerly an opportunity ol viting this g!eab cnte of industry." The Prince, atte-3id by those who ha accompanied him from Alsey-hall, by Lord. O verstoce and Mr. Fairbairn, by the Mayor and. Corpcrbion of Manchester, an d by the memba of the Execative Comraittee, then proceeded up the central hall to the dais pepared for his reception in the transept. The moment the procession. began to move the orhestra at the opposite end of the building struk up the national anther., and continued playing it till his Royal Higl}ness had taken hia plae on the dais. 'The eff"ct was very powerful, altiough somewhat XyAarred by the cheers which from time to time burst forth as the procession advanced What a sight met the gaze of the PriY, as he walked slowly up the central haLIl I Not to UCeak ,,f tbe lyivig Crowd, by whis be.Tass heartily welcomed, he was surrounded on every side by the portraits of all the most celebrated character, in British history. On the right the heavy-browed, swarthy portrait of Charles II.-in aspect the very reverse of a merry monach-seemed as if about to step from its frame and join in the ceremonial, Around him were grouped the frail beauties of hir Court, to whom Lely and De Grammont have given a queationable renown. There was the Duche3s of Cleveland, the founder of Marlborough's fortunes. y7 her side was 3adame "Carwell," as the Lon. doners of that day called the lovely niece o' Mazarin, arrayed in a dress which even improved her beauty. Near her hung the portraits of Nel! Gwynne and a host of other less fimous o- rather infamous enamorata, with Grammont himself, poor Catherine, and the execrable Countess of Shrewsbury. Glaring from the opposite walls --grim, stern, and dangerous-looldng menwere the leaders of the Commonweaith, icowling upon the seductive beauties of WhitehalL The procession passed the Museum of Art, with all Its rare treasures of gold and silver work, antique carvings, gems, and porcelains. Next in order came the Armoury-court, grim with the pondrous figures of men and heroes of all climes and ages. Some looked monstrouslygrotesque, others were bright, shining, and handsome as in the storybooks; some were of very coarse manufacture-a mere panoply of . common ironwork,-while the suits from Venice and Milan were exquisitely tempered, and inlaid with the finest aabesque deignsin gold. On the right was the complete suit of armour for man and horse which was formerly worn at coronations by Dymoke, the hereditary champion. It is the finest suit of harness in the court. The Prince, too, must have been astonished. at the extent and beauty of the collectlon of English sculpture which adorns the central halL Here, on one hand, is liarahas c Ophelia,' and, on the other, Spencer's "Highland Mary.' Beyond is Bailey's " Eve at the Fountain," the most beautiful and widely-known of all his works. Gibson's -" Elunter" faces it, and seems in the very act of slipping the leash that his hound may bound forward on the game, so full are both of energy and vigour. Next comes J. Wewtmacott's "Perl," a perfect embodiment of immortal grief. The " Greek Slave," that cold prodigy of Hiram Powers, which so narrowly escaped being the first work of the age, again greets the visitor. " Eve startled at the sight of Death," one of the most touching groups in the building, is on the right; and on the left is Wesrnacottes g'Euphrosyne," so light and airy that it seems ready to soar aloft. Arrived at the transept, his Royal Highness took his place on the dais, looking down the avenue up which he had advanced, and, hissuite having formed a brilliant semicircle round him, the orchesra performed the national anthem vocaUy, madame Clara, Novello singing the solo, Mr. Sims Reevea and fr.Weisa also taking parts. The anthem having been conclu4ed, Lord Overstone advanced, and in the name of the General Council read the following address to the Prince:- "eTo HO s llo ROL HIGMsS TE Pm.Rc AnxA'1RT, Y.G. "M3y it plee yurRoyal Highneos-In the name of the General Council, of the 13e cutive Committee, andof all the officers connected with the preparatory arrAngementa of thi great undertaking, I approach your Royal High as1 withthe expression of our deep sense of oblption for the constnt interest which your Royal Highness has taken in the success of the Exhibition now about to be opened for the gntification a nd instruction of the publh. Before, however, we enter upon the more formal pro. oedings of this day we beg to tender to your Royal High. ness our sincere condolence on the event which has brought sorrow to Her Most Gracious Majesty our Queen, to your Royal Highness, and to the members of the royal family, and which has at the same time cause d deep regret to Her Majest' subjects, who have long admired the virtues and respected the character' of her' late' Royal Highnes the Dnlhe* of Glouceakr. "In the presenoe of your-RoyiliHigTnew among us under these painfcl cmstnees and the decisidon of your Royal Highness not to suspend the ceremonial of this day, we gratefully recognize a delicate consideration of the import. 3nCe of the occasion, and a gracious desie not to disappoint the vast numbers who must have made ange. mnbts which it would have been imposible to postpone. At the same tine we respectfully appreciate and sympathize witlr those foelings which cause your Royal Highnens to desire to remain in all other respects in the strictest privacy. "OV RSTONE, "President of the General Council." His Royal Highness replied as follows:- "liMy Lord and Gentlemen,-You re very kind in think. ing at this moment of the bereavement which has befallen the Queen and herfamily. " In the Duchess of Gloucester we have all lost, not only the last of the children of that good King who occupied the throne during 60 years and carried this country fearlessly and successfully through the most momentous strggles of its history, and thus the last personal link with those times, but also a lady whose virtues and qualities of the heart had commanded the respect and love of all who knwew her. "If I have thought it my duty to attend here to-day, although her mortal remains have not yet been carried to their last place of rest, my decision has been rendered easy by the conviction that, could her own opinions and wishes havo been known, she would, 'with that sense of duty and patriotic feeling which so much distinguished her and the generation to which she lelonged, have been anxious that I should not on her account, or from private feelings, dis. torb an arrangement intended forthe public good." Mr. Fairbairn, the Chairman of the Executive Committee, who wore the uniform of a deputy. lieutenant, then approached the chair of state and read the following address, which he presented to the Prince in a case of purple velvet, embroidered with gold:- " My it please your Royal Highness,-We, the Execu. tive Committee for conducting the Exhibition of Art Treasines of the United Kingdom, appointed to our present offices at a meeting of the General Council of the Exhibition held on the 20th day of May, 1856, humbly approach your Royal Highness on the auspicious occasion of your presiding at this inaugural ceremony, to lay before your Royal Highness a short account of the history and progress of the undertaking to the present time. " Before alUuding to our aetual proceedings, we would ask permission to rem ark that this great gathering of the most precious and remarkable works of art in the unnted kingdom may be considered the legitimate oftspring of that happy suggestion for the instruction and enjoyment of vast masses of our felow-ereatures of all classes aud countries and for the good of all mankind, which, crigina. ting with yonr Royal Hghness, had so glorious a triumph in the success of the Gr eat 3xhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in 1.855. The interchange of know. Iedg. which that magnificent undertaldng and tsaequally magnifiet successo,, the French Ehibition of 1853, effected, has already proved of the greatest value in ad- vancing the art of design, and promo ting all branches of huTan industry. Both tbese aren!,3 of peseefol rivei1y, sovividintheir coatmaste. the more excitir,&intermational contests which'we 'have sinco wits cased, ware remoaskable, 2a regards the'Ebglish element,'for two broadly-defined features; they showed to the World at lap-our best chstoreas-the peculiha emeellene'3 of many of those great staple manufctures which er- ploy and feed the Industrial population ot these iEA2 S4, and they showed to ourseives eur own deFmienciss in antt ers of tst and deign. While, therefore, then was a mr .tual gain, ad tere spng up a Idndller inte=national fe&,Aing, there originated also a desire for the acquiremeat ou "the one hand of a knowledge of the nseful, and on the othi .r an appreciation of the beautiful. " The promoters o', the present Bxhibition conceived it possible to carry t .e beneficent intentions of their predecessors in such urldertakings one step further. The project of a purel y Fine Art Exhibition on a great scale appeared at f,R sight, to say the leat of it, somewhat problematic',L as regards its financial success; hut when the subject waa sifted, when it was found how comprehensive were, its details and application, how wonderfully rich our hap .py country-untrodden for many a eentury by any foreir a invader-unquestionably is in all that unequalled Weal.th and civilization oould accumulate, and how much PV' sitive and immediate good was likely to result froru the J .ringing together of the eager and inquiring mindu' of our time with the realizations of the genius of part ages and other countries, the project assumed a propor4don of im. portnce which at once commanded the attention and cied aloud for fulfilment. " The firt suggetion of the Art Treaus Exhibition wa submitted by AMr. D-ne, the Gensr1 Commioner of the Exhibitioen, to an. iedusntial m9r'.ting of Manchester pentlemen, on the 26th day of March, I856. The scheme was fAvourably reoeived, and, dependent upon the suocess of the application for public support in the way of subcrip. tion, was voted into existnoo. And hers we would request your Royal Eighnes's special attention to a remrk. able feature in the history of this undertaking. without any public appeal, without even a general l2ca canva, contributions to a guarantee fund amounting to not loes thin 74,0001. were raised in this city within a period of three weeks From this fact we would draw the inferenoe that the promoters of all schemes professing to commend themselves by their intrinsio nerita to public approval need not and ought not to be deterred from promulgating their Offorts by the lack of positive money gifts, but would rather do well to test tho sterling value of their conceptions by this form of appeal for the guarautoe of the whole expenditure required. "Upon the oompletion of the guantee fund, and after havig obtained the patronage of Her Most Gracious Mjesty the Queen and the mnrked and spocial enconragement of Your Royal Highness, -we at onco invited designs for a building suited to the purpoes of the Exhibition. After a careful considerationw of the designs and estimates sent in to us in oompetition, that of Messrs. C. D. Young and Co., of Edinburgh, was fally selected. The bulding works, notwithstanding the intervention of winter months, having been brought to a timely and satiafactory completion, the interior decorations wero entrusted to Mr. Crace, of London; and we venture to hope that, asregards their appropriat-ees for the favourable display of works of art, the committee's docison inboth reapect will meet with your Royal Highnes' approval. "We gladlY Avai oursebes Of tho oppOrtunity of conveying, through your Royal. Highness, to our most gra cious Sovereign the expression of our profound gratitude for the oordial and most munificent patronage. and support which Her Mhjesy has vouchsaed to our labours Her Mgaj-Ws loy al subjects in this part of her dominions will recognize in the vaiety, splendour, and ran exodelene of Her Majesty's contributionr to the Exhibition another evidence of their Sovereign's unocaingdesire for the advan ment of her people's true interests and welfare. We would also respectfully tender to your RoyalHighness our gratl thanks for the valuable assistauce and advice w have on numerous occsionsreceived fromyour Royal Hghnes. "Without the support and oo-operation of the owne of art treares througbout the kingdom, our undertaking would, as a matter of course; have failed. The character and excellence of th. contributions by which your Roial Elighness is now surrounded, and the value of the property deposited in this bauilding by so manytcontributors, form the noblest testimony to the patriotic nd unelfish eba racter of our countrymen of all ranks. We be21eve so general an evidenco of self-denial and the sacrifie of per sonal convenience for the public good to be without a paralel, and we sincerely feel howinadequ%te is the language at our command to express wbat is due from us to all for the generous support that has been accorded us. "In connexion with our proceedings we would very briefly refor to the circumstances under which one ve important feature of the Exhibition, the well-known historic museum of works of decorative art collected by Xi Soulage, of Toulouse, ha found its way to Manchester. Upon the refusal by' ler MajesWs Government to pur chase' this choice coloecoto at prime cost, we considered wewere acting in the true interests of art in volunteering on our individual reqiontibitie to purctba the colliction upon the Terms tat had jv been refsd Wo desired that a collection of so high an education al value to our arisa should havo the bonefit of the widest possible exnation; and we would exPress a confident hope tht it may yet be preserved in Its ntirety after the close of this Exhibition for more general public Insrution. " We cannot close thig addres withot expressng a hope that, in the languawe sed by your RoyalTllb in the letter you addressed to our lamented president, the late Rarl of Ellesmers a nationusflness will roelt from the educational direction which we have endeavoured to impart to the whole scheme. "On behalf of theExecutivo Committee, a' THOIAS FAIRBAM, Chairman." His Royal Highneus retumned the following reply - "Gentlemen of the Executive Committee,- "I thank yoU most siUcereWly for your kind address. "The expressions of loyalty and attachmen' to the Queen which it conveys will, I feel cerWin, be most gratifying to her.

HANGING BY LYNCH LAW.-We have just leant from Mr. Black, of Andrew, the old oounty seat of Jack-. son County, 26-miles south of Dabuque, the particulars ot the banging at. that place by a mob on Saturday last,. the . 11th inst., of Eli Grifford, a half-breed. Grifford had murdered a. man. named John Ingalls about. the 28th of March. He was- arrested and lodged in gaol at-. Andrew on the 31st of March and was taken from the, gaolon Saturday last at about 2 o'clock p.m. by a mob of 24 of the citizens. of the vicinity where the murder was perpe trated-Iron-hill post-officee, in the same county, and ahout 14 miles from Andrew.

Grifford say that he was isetig ated to the murder aid paid for doing it by his un ale, a ma named Jasreit, and another named David W D)eald, neighbours of Ingills An old grudge existed betwli en them, which had been fostered; fronitiane to time by h *tile acts from both parties. Ingalls hbad threatened tobern Jarrett's house, and for this Ingalls had been arrested. Ir Calls wa a lage and powerful man, and in personal enci ,lnters wa too much for any of hia opponents. Forthis he was doomed to deatb, and the confederates, Jarrett, F i'Donald and Grifford, determined that the deed should be lone by the latter, the two former agree. h2g to pay hima aertain sum and help him to leave the State. Grifford s a native of Mssouri, where his mother residesnow.

1?OBEIGN XNTELLIGEYCBR FRANCE. A E°°1 o2 'fio Pollow1ng appearad In our eoond rfmton ol Ics0day:-1 (moM OUu OWN cowrRoimmirml PARIS, MONDAY, MAY 4X 6 P.M. The Emperor seems determined that the Swi3 Vonfederation shall not forget the visits of foreign Princes to Par-is; and it seems to be a rule laid down that Switzerland shall be mnubbed in their presence. Can it be by way of paying a compliment to these illustrious strangers that an old friend is thus brought to book? The Moniteur read a severe lectume to Switzerland just at the moment that the Prince of Prussia was a guest at the Tulleries; and it now administers a correction to the amme Government, not I trust as a delicate flattery to the Grand Duke Constantine; but the coincidence Is remarkable. The Helvetic Governmest lately caused to be published in a Berne newspaper the draughts of the treaty and protocol adopted by the Conference. The Monitetr expresses its anger at that publication in these terms:- "e Some jou2nals ofBerme have just published draughts of ntreatyandprotccolointended to sur thesettlement of the affair of NeuchAteL This publication, which can only have resulted from an unjustifiable indiscretion, is, moreover, on s3veral points at variance with 'the real text of the dcoument in question-a toxt which has not yet been definitively decided on. Thb betrayal of the s=ereoy of a negotiation not yet terminated is the more to be regretted as it might sompromise thie success of the contemplated aangement"| It was probably indiscreet to give these documents to the public before the negotiations were concluded; but the length of time that this miserable fair has lasted, the general disgust at the pettfogging conduct of the K:ing, and the discontent of the SwimS people at being made, as they believe, the dupes of their confidence in the French Government the moment the prisoners were liberated,-all this should be taken into consideration. Every one is weaxy of the NeuchAtel qnestion, and the Swissv were beginning. to be appreheneive that something still more serious was to happen. Be this as it may, when Dr. Kern presented himself at the Foreignoffice on Saturday last he was received cavalierly enough, and he was as I understand, informed that so much annoyed did the Emperor feel at the premnature publicity given to the prooeedings that he was nearly disposed to suspend the negotiations altogether, and let Switzerland mttle with Prussia as she might. M. de Hatzfeldt, whose Royal maater very probably dislikes premature publicity as much as the Emperor Napoleon himself, made strong complaints about this unpardonable indiscretion. r. Kern, it appears, denies having anything to do with the publication; on the contrary, when he heard of the intention to publish he sent a teleg,raphic message to Berne to stop it, but in van Dr. Kern has been singularly indisceet or singularvy unlucky throughout the whole of this affair. He was censured at the commencement for having indiscreetly revealed to the Federal Council that the Emperor had shown him private letters fom the King f Prussia of so satisfactory a nature as to induce them to liberate the prisoners. Friends of Dr. Kern positively affirm that no blame is to be attached to him, inasmuch as he had full authority from the Emperor to make the disclosure. Be this as it may, no conference has been held to-day but it is thought nevertheless that the treaty wiU 1e signed before the week is at an end. The Grand Duke Constantine visited the Observatory, the Palace of the Luxembourg, where the Senate sits, and some other public buildings during the early part of the day. At 3 o'clock he received some members of the diplomatic corps. There was no very warm affection between the Grand Dalke and Prince Napoleon in the beginning and it has diminished on further acquaintance. Whatever be the Prince's faults hypocrisy is certainly not among them, and he has not the art, of which the utility is very doubtful, of showing enthusiasm where he does not feel it. He dislikes the Russia litiCauy, and he takes no pains to conceal his dislike, as any one might perceive who saw the Princes seated side by side as they drove along the Boulevards on Thursday last. The Emperor wishes to be well with all, " comcrver," as the homnely proverb says, " la wvre et le dwou" Thetak is a difficult one, and does not always succeed. The Grand Duke expected to be met at Toulon by still greater personages than the Prefects or even the Minister of Marine. He knows the changes that had to be made in the original programme, and the reasons which rendered those changes necessary; and, whatever appearances are, he is not quite at bis ease. Then, one of the first sounds that struck his ear the moment he drove along the Boulevards was the cry of the vendors of the Presse newspaper, that moment published,-"La Presse, jotrnal du soir; article sur 1'alliance AnIslaise !" You may easily suppose how lttle to his taste were such sounds, particularly if he knew from what inspiration the writer of the article derived his arguments. Il the meantime the Prince is picking up all the information he can gather, and inspecting everything, to turn it to account at some future time. Colonel Yvan Kochanovich, of the Russian Marine Artilery, nephew of the general who commanded at Kinburn when it was attacked by the aUies, has arrived in Paris and has paid his respects to the Grand Duke Constantine. General Guedeonoff, Director of the Imperial Theatres in Russia, has left St. Petersburg to visit Paris, passing through Germany. The Austrian Government has given some large orders in France for machinery for the ll steamahips of war in construction at Trieste, Venice, and PoL Of these one is a ship of the line, three frigates, and two corvettes. The Ministerial journal Le Pays contains the following paragraph:- " A private telegraphic despatch received at London annouces that the treaty of peace concluded between Great Britain and Persia had nc' been ratified by the Court of Teheran. We know from private information that this news is inaccurate. The text of the treaty, on account of the state of the roads could not arrive at Teheran before the l1th or 20th of Aril, and, as,30 or 35 days at least are required to go from the capital of Persia to the first telegraphic station, it is physicaUy impossible that the reply of the Court of Teheran could be known at this momentf" Maron .iros, who has been appointed to proceed on an extraordinary mission to China, was received this morning at a private audience by the Emperor. I am informed that the steam-frigate Impetueuse is, together with thefrigate Audacieuse, to bedespatched to reinforce the French fleet in the China Seas. The report that a Vice-Admiral is to be sent to China to take the command of the French fleet in those seas is confirmed. The two candidates having the best chance of the appointment are Admiral Dubordieu, Maritime Prefect at Toulon, and Admiral R main Desfosses. Commercial affairs in Pa-is, which it was hoped were beginning to recover from their long inaction, were again paralyzed lat week by the cold weather which prevailed. The shopkeepers complain of the little business doing, and when the shops are deserted the manufacturers suffer. Even the commission agents show no disposition to purchase. The species of financial crisis which prevails in most of the great towns throughout Europe compels the merchants to limit their operations,in order not to bind themselves to engagements which probably they could not fulfil m consequence of the scarcity of capital. Eight and ten per cent. have been paid in Germany for discounts, and this fact explains the little demand in that country for French zxuufactmres. The most considerable orders now nceived in France are from Russia, and great%Zectations are entertained thab when the anodjA4V&(oms' tariff comes into force in Russia largo §qpiti5 of French produce will be ex3oeoRdhiat4eopuitry. The corn-market bus again e,pelcwd',a. aligt rise this week. The cold wea1therseged ga a pretext to the farmers to raise their pxiees^butit is not expected that the late rise cvn make furthe progress or even be maintained. The nse in wheat may be set down at 70 centimes the hectolitre. Thne accounts from the various markets in France all note a rise of prices The rise in wheat ia Uf. the hectolitre in the south, and lf. 50c. and even 2f. in the north. These accounts tended to render the Paris market more fi*n. At the same time that the official price of bread was reduced one centime the pound in Paris the price of flour wras gradually rising. Te best maks were disposed of at from 76f. to W7f. 60c., being a rise of lf. on the preceding week. Thne bakers, however, sre not inclinled to submit to this increase of price, and eales are effected with difficulty. The principal business transacted Is in four of ordinary qtuality. Wheat is beginning to arrive iu large quantities at Mareilles from Egypt and Algeria, where the crops are nearly ripe, and promis an abundant harve3t. This favourable appearance induces the holders -of grain to dispose of their stock. Nevertheless, the price of wheat rose last week at larseilles mn consequence of a re. newed demand from Spain for hard wheat from the Levant at 43f., the weight of 126 kilograrnmes, and Taganrog 48f. and 49f. Letters received at MarseiUes from Genoa and Leghorn announce a further rise in the corn market of those towns. Raw silk of good quality was in demand at Marseilles last week; 150 bales were sold at prices varying from 40f. to lOOf. the kilogramme; 20,000 kilo. grammes of cocoons were likewise sold at fair prices. There had been some fears entertained in the south for the safety of the silkworm in consequence of the cold weather, which gave rise to soine active speculation in raw SUk both at Lyons and Valence. It appeared. on furtht inquiry tuhat the mercury in the thermometer had not fallen below freezing point, and that the production of the silkworm is progressing with favourable appeaft5i1s. The- sudden change of weather from hot to cold 10 days since caused some uneasiness in the wine-growing districts, which for. tunately proves to be exaggerated. Some vines, it is true, have been frozen In Burgundy and in the IsEre, but the evil is far from being general. The lower parts only of the C6te d'Or have suffered. In the Yonne the vineyards in the plain have suffered as muckhss by the frot of the 6tfiof -May last year. The other part, and Cbablis amOng them, have-not bests injured. In- thes Juila t he vineyards .in 5 the low. grounds of Poligny haveo more or less suffezed, The holden of 'wines have taken advantage of the weather to'raise their prices.

BBERLIN, MAY 3. The most interedting- subjects connected with Russia just now-are the newtariff, that is to be pub. lished some of these day, anu the new railways, that are to be constructed at some future period. With reference to the firA I communicatd to you about a monthbacksomepardcul hathrshedme from KMnigsberg of the intended tarin, . and !since then the Vord has, under thename ofthe "New Russia. Tariff," piblished a long list of commercial articles, with certain percentages of Customs' dues affixed to them, presenting an interesting fancy pieture of the coming event. Simultaneously with that publication on the part of the .Nord, I informed you that the prospect of the new tariff appeurs to recede in proportion as we approach the eopeming of thenavigation-the period when itwas aMnounced to appear; and that now there is very little chance of its being. promulgated before the close of the present yeafs navigation. The follo*ing remarks, from a well-informed source, will be found to corroborate the last-stated views e-The document that the Nord has made use of can be no.thing more than .some preliminary draughtt the best, seeing that as yet no fresh tariff has been submitted to thfie Imperial Council for deliberation, anad t.his is the most importaxt, because the last, tribunil before whbich such a measure could be brought preparatory to being laid before the Emperor for his sanction. In additionto the opposition naturally to be expected from the upholders of the necessity bf strong protection for native industry, is to be mehtioned the circumstance that during the late war some alleviations in the import tr de by land, necessitated by the blockade of the ports, were introduced, and that these have been retained even since the ports have been opened. In conformity with the cautious tactics of the Government on fisdal matters, it may be expected that it will content itself with prolonging this tdal for a few years before it proceeds to greater changes; and that what the nature of the changes will be, when eventually made, is not a subject for sanguine aspirations. One event very injurious to the coulezr-deC4se visions that have been hitherto indulged in bn the score of a new Ruisian tariff ;is the lamented death of the Mnister Tengoborski, who was the main promoter of a freeer movement to be imparted to commerce,and to whose hands the elaboration of the new taiffwas intruated. As yet, there has been no provision made as to whose shoulders his mantle shall fall on. As regards the working out of the convention to be concluded between Russia and Denmark, touching the mode of paying the quota that Russia has undertaken to defray towards the redemption of the Sound Dues, that task has been made over to his son, but even these negotiations have been broken off by the sad event, in consequence of which the son was summoned to St. Petersburg to attend the father's funeral. The next subject of interest is the great railway scheme. In St. Petersburg there is a talk of the term for keeping open the subscription lists being prolonged, and permissiou being given for subscriptions to be received in Moscow, Odessa, and other cities of the empire. Hlitherto it was incumbent on every speculator to appear in St. Petersburg, either in person or by attorney, for the purpose of subscribing. The bait lately held out to the public at large by the Russian Government, in permitting these railway shares to be taken at par in deposit on the part of persons who have to give security to the Government, will have no other effect than to produce a few illusory quotations of high prices in Ruisia itself. The bulk of speculators there even will be unaffected by this gracious offer, and, as regards other countries, there can hardly be a dozen men who wil in any way make use of the advantage offered them. Some person has written to the Augsbffg Aligemeine Zeitung from here, andstated that, now that all attempts at introducing the Russian railway shares into the various StockExchanges of Euirope have totally failed, the originators of the scheme intend to put up with the first loss, and to forfeit their deposit of 20,000,000f.; but, though this has been written, and printed into the bargain, there is no necessity to believe it. A few days back four French engineers passed through here on their way to Wilna, where they are to take in hand the railway works about to be prosecuted there in continuation of the St. Petersbu Warnaw line; and it is this line evidently, withu its branches to Prissia, which will be the first and main object of attention to the Government, as offering the greatest advantages to the commnereial world, and possessing the best chances of paying Major-General }erbedz, one of the two commin5saries of the Russian Government for conducting the negotiations with this Govermment with reference to the Russo-Pru8sian branch lines, has returned to St. Petersburg after spending some time in inspecting the western provinces through which the St. Petersburg-Warsaw line will have to run; and all thevarious Russianofficials whohaveforso3me time been travelling in Germany for the purpose of making them selves acquainted with railwayarrangew ments, are now flocking home with all expedition. Certin English engineer, on the other hand, have already passed through K6nigsberg on their way to Riga, where the works for the new railroad to Diana are being prosecuted with all energy; one of their first tasks will be the mounting of a large swing bridge that hu been made for this, company in EngLand. Advices from Theodosia (Kaffa), at the other extremity of Russia, mention that as soon as the news had become known that the town had been fixed on to form a terminus of a long line of railroads the prices of land and houses rose in the most fabulous and Incredible manner, so that small plots of land,~ with old tumble-down buildings upon themn, sold for prices that would pureba. an hotel in the lewsi Perspective. s soon as everythinhg asbeught up in the tow, and no mwe aellers wereto be met with, all the outlying SPATN. (rnorr ouR owN conarMWoNDrUr.) MADRID, ApnM 30. A paragraph is going the round of the papers, founded on a letter from Paris, which says that Count Montemolin, wearied out, and hopeless of attaining to the throne of Spain by force, has authorized certain foreign personages to reconcile hin with the Queen, whom he agrees to recognize provided he be allowed to return to his country as Infante, and that the property of his family be restored to him, or an mndemnity granted him for itg loss. Don Juan de Borbon, it is said, refuses to subscribe to this arrangement, which Russia is zealously working to effect, while the Cabinets of England and Franco are reported unfavourable to it. I have no positive Information with respect to this pretended negotiation and to the proceedings of Russia in the affair, but it does not appear at all likely that Montemolin would abdicate his pretensions to the Spanish Crown; and I know that there are Carlists here who laugh at the report and utterly discredit it. A London paper lately announced the arrival at Madrid of Senor Barrera, attached to the Mexican Legation at Paris, with despatches relating to the dispute between Spain and Mexico. The Epoca adopted thls information aa its own; it has been copied into moet of the Madrid papers, and undue importance has been given to it. Senor Barrera certainly pawsed through here, now two or three weeks ago, but he had no official mission whatever, and was merely on his way to Andaluzia, on privale business relating to an inheritance. I am g ad to say, however, that the chances of an amicable a 1- justment of the difficulty referred to become daily stronger. It is probable that Senor Lafragua wil- leave Paris for Madrid as soon as the next mail from Mexico arrives-that is to say, I on the 2d or 3d of May. I do not imagine that he awaits by that mail permission to come here, although it is expected tfat the contents of the despatches he wil receive willrather strengthen him in his present intention. He and Marshal Serrano appear to have been mutualy welU pleased with each other, and with the realwt of their interviews at Paris, and, unless something uuexpected supervene, there can be butKlittle doubt of a satisfactory agreement being ome' to. Marshal Serrano was to arrive at Madrid in the course of last night, and his personal oommunications to his Go. vern-ent will doubtless forward matters step. The ship of the line Doia Iisbel IL, thefmg1a t Baylen, the brig Pelayo, the steamer Fr%ucisco de Aus, aid two smaller, yessels, are under orders to aail from Cadiz with troops for the Havannah and with the three Generls who left Madrid two 'days ago for the former port. The Gazete cbntains an account of the restoration of the urn containing the aahes of the groet captain, parcels of ground were submitted to the same procem of greedy speculation. The prohibition of the export of gold has been removed; as also another prohibition-viz., that by which serfs were forbidden to quit the confines of the Russian Empire. They are now permitted, in all cases where they can produce a written Permission from their owners, to receive pawsports for travelling abroad. The permission given to the ExecUtive Senate, January, 1855, to issue Treasury notes for the purpose of covering the extraor.dnary expenses of the war is now withdrawn. Th Emperor. has decided on devoting the 50. which the late Emperor.W16holas had set aside for the purchase of the "Ecmperors Cu " to be run for at Ascot to the Moscow rames; the cup which had been designed for the Ascot races in 1854, buat withdrawn en account of the war, has now been advertised to be run for at Mowcow. STATE OF NAPLES. (FROM O0M OWN OORMSPOWDRuT.) - '' INAPLES, APlM 27. It i3s aremarkable eoludidence that at the same time that a, decree was passed for extinguishing the little light that renders darknes visible -in this country measures were being taken to increase the power of the priesthood. My 1iAt letter' noticed 'the -decree forbidding the' youth 'of. the' country to coma up to --NaPles -for their .sudies or diplom. .An old lady in a provincial town in England might po3.sibly consider thin an advantage; trouble and exTense would besaved, moral contanaination avoided, and her boy would remain at home. There ia -scarcely a vilhnge, however,. in, England which has not the-advantage over any.pro vincial town of the iTwo Siilea ,and-per4hapsStarorosa or Iiftlwithiel ,iD the West,0ofJ.Egland, would. offer opportunities of improvement vastly superior to any which could be ptocured at'Salerno, the second city in the kingdom of Naples.' - Imagine, however, towns in the centro andat the extremity of the kdngdom, with stil greater dizadvantages,, choset as , the seats ,of, lyceaums, wlere, 41 the learning of the next generation is to,be acquired. The diploma won theiewill be cheap indeed, but it will represent ignorance. Muieunms and libraries of ' reference, -which exist in the capita1, are of- courze not to .be' foundi.in pirovincal towns,.. and the current literature.of the day wri be represented, perhapsi by. an Mculo., on the griefs of the Madonna Addolorata, or the seven wounds of Jesus Christ, or suiritual'exercises for the monuh of May. Such sre the literary advantages which the youth of the kIngdom are'to enjoy.' A Word now es to their material position. T elegraphs. and Tailways and the rapid cir.culation, of-, th2.population will carry -new ideas fom pno end qf Great Britain.to the other in an inconceivably Fhort,space of time. The miner of CornwaLll, or the peasnt of Devonshir,' 'or the 'weaver 'of Mancdiwtaw m.- 1"- I- Is going :on at the WOrl&s8 end if he choosesbut'the atudent in a provincial lyceum in the Two Sicilies can ucarcely know, what tramnpires beyond the precincts of his native.town. In many parts of the country there are no roads; where ther are any, pasports are' necessary from one province to another. Pan3ports are most reluctantly given, and e.ven when given the Intendent, and the Sotto Intendente, .nd the Giudice Regio, and commisries and policemen .are all watching over the unfortunate individual. who bears it. How cm lght iass through such guarded media as these T? regard, thebefore, the recent decree as cruel and iniquitous in the extreme, as ruinous to the national mind, but as the strength and protection of the present official system and of its medimval church.' I cannot well deseibe .the indignation which it bas awakened ihere. I fear to say how many, thousand students and priests have been expelled from Napleswithin the last six months. The other great measure.tW.whichI alluded above is the 0tasiConcordat, which, it is maid, is either signed or about to be signed. A panic exists throughout Naples on this head, and it is the greater that no one knows anytbing decidedlyabout it. Thatsome- thing terrible, however, is impending is confirmed. by the general voice. All that I can do is to send youwhat I he.ar from the best sources open to me. Tt is .said, then, hat the Royal exequatur is to be dispensed with except in a very few trifling cases; that the civil power is no longer to intervene in cases . of matrimony; that the power of the pariah priest is to be greatly extended over families, and is to be supported by the public force; and that eoclesiatical property is to be relieved of taxation. There is something so monstrous in all this that I suspend my judgment while wAiting; but still what I write I have heard from credible authorities. Of one thing, however, I am pretty sure, that the Church, which has been working on the feelings and conscience of Ferdidinand IL full may a year, has gained a great victory. The expedition to the Argentine territory is now again seriously spoken of, and last week either five or seven merchant vessels were actually chartered by the Government. The Government has power enough to send off as many of its subjects as it chooses. A report circulates, to which I do not give much implicit confidence, that the Tuscan Government, through its Minister, has offered to receive a number of political prisoners The interest on the deposits of Rentes has been reduced from 4i to 4 per cent.; Government advances three-fourths of their value on Rentes in tne Five per Cents. The consequence of this measure was a rise in the Five per Cents. from 110U to 11.1. A Muratist placard, of which some thousands of copies, it is said, have been introduced into Naples, is now being circulated here. A decidedly Muratiat party does not exist here, nor would, I think, any effort in his favour be originated here; but so great is the universal discontent that I think any efFort in favour of any one from rithout would he sympathized with and supported. The great desire is innediate relief, without looking to the distant future. Five per Cents., 211;_ exchange on London, 543.

The Rattler steamer brings Lisbon dates of the 26th ult., when Her Majesty's ships Ezmouth and Colossus were under orders to leave for Portsmouth the following day. The sailors and marines had been out several times on -the south side of the Tagua for field exercise, and the young Kng of Portugal, having heard a favourable report of them, was desirous that Captain yes should have another field-day that he might see their exercise before they left; lut it appeared the Admiralty orders for the return of the two ships proved a bar to the King's wishes, and after their - departure the Princess Royal will be the only British ship-of-war in the Tagus. -. l'he report of the Committees of Finance and Publi.

The'facihties that recent commercial enterprise afforded to the operations of the eociety were exoeedingly favourable. The Eunliratos Valley Railway could not fail to exercise a most beneficial influenoe, not only on the socil, mora and political condition of those countries through which that lineLof oommunication would pass, but also on the oountries lying to the east of that lne, and which would be brought by its meants into more immediate contact with the civilization of the nations of the wes In Africa and China, also, there were openings for extenive m;isionay labours of a very satisfactory nature, and he would earnestly impress upon the minds of the members of the society the great responsibility which devolved up-on them to avail themselves of the favourable opportunities that were presented to them for promoting the great work of Christian misson.

He had been requestea, un moving the adoption of the report, to dwell upon the claim which the missionary cause had upon the minitry at home. he would not enter into any of those foolish objections whichhadbeen refted a thoutnd times, such as that they hadsomuchto do a home that they could not think of the preaching abroad . Now it was well known that where the ceople of any Patsi Worked zealouslY for the heathen at ofme, in that Parish there was more than usual zeal displayed for the welfare and conversiotn of the heatn aroad. They all know thet among the hmasses of the popuiation of that metropolis there were some who were sunk into a ate of heathenism dee r even than those living in the moat remote placmes earth, and that if they should ever be stirred up to consi4er their everlasting stte it would be by the exertions of the very persons who were connected with that and kindred societies for the Purpose of spreocing the knowledge of theLord through the disaut places of the earth. There was a great claim by the missionary cause abroad upon the ministry at home,-a claim which, if they endesa voured to satisfy, they would reap as a reward the blessing of success upon their labours at home. Thus was it that the very same spirit which made them zealous to promote Christianity abroad made them also zealous for its propaga. tion at home, for it was an undoubted truth that, as the Lord had cmmitted to them the work abroad, so He would be the more ready to bless their efforts at ome if b heir zeal they answered the claim which the Lord, hmae upon them. Another point in reference to the ministry at home was the claim there existed upon them, and especially upon the young men belonging to the ministry, to devote themselves to this difficult work, and to go forth into foreign landls to accmplish the mission desiagned for them. This, however, was a topic which he felt it would hardly beome him to dwell upon, but they were in the presence of a dear friend who for mnany years ha left his country and all the attractions of home. and had devoted himself to missonary labour on the bleak- coat of Norh Aerca;hemigt ellspak fwhe uyofon all th seducions ad hope ofprmotio at hom. bet lecs, yet it should not be forgotten that they bad abundant labour at home, and that their desire was to be united with their brethren who had gone forth to distant lands, so that with.heart and zeal in their great work both abroad and at bhome they should be One. (Cheers.) He oonsidered it a special privilege to be himself connected with the missionary work. At the first ordination held by him he was caUed upon to ordain eight young men for the missionary work, and he looked forward to every coming ordination for a repetition of the pleasure which he experienced in laying his hands upon those young men. He believed that the presence of those young men at the ordiation wa ood both for them and for those with whom they were =nfted. It was good for them to have connexion with the Church at home, and of which they will think in the midst of their labours and privations, knowing the prayers that vrero offered up in this great empire wrhen they were ordained would have their effect, and knowing, also, that if it pleased God to bring any of them back to their home they would always, he trusted, find a weloome from him who ordained them, and from all around them in this metropoli. He believed it was good, not for them only, but for those with whom they were united, that they should be preeent at the ordination, because if among them there should be any young man about tc enter intothemissionary office thoughtlessly, andwith regard only to his own ease, he wonld be reminded by the presenoc of those who had already laboured in the inclement temperature of North America, or amid the burning sands of Africa, what it was he wausndertalingto do, and howould be unable to forget the great truth that they were all mis. sionariesboth athomeand abroad. No mau could tread tle paths of this metropolis without feeling that tbere wa a greatmnionaryworkgoingon,andtbatthatgr tmiionwy work, both at hume and abroad, was closely united. Those vho were doing d it at houe mut take eneouragetent and examapl frora thr^s wh wrere labeuring abroad. He would ct detan ttie hcting any longer, bkt would only sy tlsaS whatavcw calls of business they might have elsewlhered hea t hoecalswol ro" him from that meeting-they could notroelly be more importbat*a the duty which hai then caled them together. LAt no one think that thee meetings were useless, or were the mere sult of religions excitement. They caume there to meet. face to face, those who wrere doing God!s work in distant lands; and he doubted uot that when they again went forth to those disat lands, after having united with the friesi who had worked with them here, the prayers and blessingc of those friends would be present with them to cheer then the hour when th heart wasnot unlikely to falter amid the pressure of their overwhelming labours. These meet- ngs had a great fostering and sustaining power, and be doubted not that the blessing of the Lo had descended and would descend upon themformany years tooome. (Cheers.)

TEE PUBLIC HEALTH. (From the Registrar-General's weekly retun,) The deaths registered in London, which in the three proviouis weeks of April were on the average 1,069, declined in the week that ended on Saturday to 1,038. The present return furnishes very clear indication that the public health is un. usually good. In the ten years 1847.66 the average num. ber of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,046; but, as the deaths of last week occurred in an in. creased popalation, the average, with a vievr to comparison, mnst be raised in proportion to the increase, in which case it will become 1,151. The deaths now returned were there. fore less by 113 than the number which the average rate of mortality at this season in previous years would have proiaued, IThe weather has lately been very cold; the mean daily temperature was constantly below the average during the n days after the 21st ult., and frequently to the extent of eight degrees or more below it, while at several times the thermometer fell near to, or even below, the freezing point of water. It does not appear, howrever, that this circam. stance has operated so far as to cause any serious aggrava. lion of pulmonary complaints, for the deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, exclusive of phthisis, which had been previously above 200, fell last week to 177; and those from bronchitis, which had been above 100, fell to 84. The deaths from phthisis (or consumption) were 150 last week, a 'nmber which nearly agrs with the corrected average of 4corresponding weeks, >szty children, all of whom, except three, were under Your years of age, died of hooping-cough; the average of Weekly nurabers is 54. Four fatal cases occurred in the sub-district of Kensington; also four in that of St. John's, Westminster. Not a single a&se of smallpox was registered, onlthough a child died of "varicella" in Mile-end, The deaths from measles rose to 36, which occurred principally In the Central and East districts; exceptfourin the district of Labeoth, there were none on the south side of the river. 2)rphus was fatal in 36 cases, nearly half of which occurred in the south diatricts. Five persons are recorded as the victims of intemperance, besides twe who died from delirium gremen.s. Three nonagenarians are returned, the oldest a man 93 years old, who died in the Shoreditch workhouse. Last week the births of 896 boys and 849 girls (in aU 1,745 children) were registered in London. In the 10 correspondIng weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,56. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height o0 the barometer in the week was 29-912 in. The baro. *neter rose to 30 in. on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 41-5 deg, which is 7-5 deg. below the averarge of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). On Sunday, the 26th, the mean temperature was only 37 deg., which is 10-6 deg. below the average. Tho lowest temperature oocurred on Wednesday, and was 29-1 deg.; the highest on Saturday, and was 59 deg. The range of the week was 29 9 dog. The mean dew-point tomporature was 350 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 6-5 deg. The wind blew on every day from the north-east til Saturday. No appreciable *nmount of rain feU in the week, though there were slight showers on several days. Every day is deseribed by the observer as " cold," " very cold," or " intensely cold."
THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The ofrioial "Statistical Abstracts of the United Kingdom in each of the last 15 years, from 1842 to 3856, presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty," do not give the public all the information they are entitled to have in suach a publication. It appears lu one of the tables that the public revonues or income in the year 1851 was only 52,233,0061.; in another, that the civil list and civil charges of aU kinds were in that year only 6,915,6261.; and in the "total expenditure" column this last sum appears as a reality. But if there is any truth in the official Finance Accounts of the United Kingdom, No. 196, for the year 1851 (ended the 5th of January, 1852) the balances due and owing to the public revenue were 1,266,0821. 14s. 4 7-12d. at the commencement of that finan- ial year; and the gross receipts during that same year were 57,964,4641. 16s. 6 2-12d., together 69,230,5471. 0s. 10 9-126., minus 1,129,754Z. 6s. 0id. for repayments of discounts and deductions in the nature of drawbacks, leaving 58,100,793Z. 4s. 10 6-12d. as the total amount belonging to the public legitimately to be accounted for in this official abstract. The difference between 58,100,7931. 4s. 10 6-12d. and 52,233,0061. is 5,867,7871. 49. 10 6-12d., which added to the above 6,915,6261 makes the "civil list and civil charges of aU kinds" amount to the very gross (query, "not to be known " ?) sum of 12,783,4131. 4s. 10 6-10d., less Z371,4021 7s. 34d. for the balances outstanding on the 5th of January, 1852; it is evident that the " total amount" taken from the public revenue by some person or persons during the financial year 1851 for the " civil list and civil chargesof alkinds" wasnotlessthanll,412,0101. 17s. ? 3-12d., of whioh only 6,915,6261. appear in these financial ab3tracts. Now, Sir, permit me to solicit your attention to the official audit of the public accounts of this country, and I believe you will find it quite as " ludicrous" as l7Ve Times so truly described the audit of the accounts of the Royal British Bank to have been, but of far more serious consequences to the industrious classes of this overtaxed country, because this Royal British Bank affair has involved about half a miUion of money only; whereas the very questionable audit of the public accounts involves five, if not ten, or more millions annually! The Times very justy adds,-" The exposure of the manner in which the accounts of the Royal British Bank were audited ought not to be without effect upon the public"-more particularly wh..u they can see that the audit of the public accounts of this nation " simply enables the checking auditors to assert that the money voted to the several departments has, or has not, been wholly expended. It is the fashion to hold that the practice of an audit affords considerable security to share. holders in a joint-stock undertaking; the case is rather the reverse. When truth and honesty exist at head-quarters, then, precisely when it is little needed, or not needed at all, there wiUl be a fair audit of accounts. On the other hand, when a spirit of trickery and rascality presides over the operations of a board the audit wiUl be nothing better than a farce and an imposture. It is to be hoped the late disclosures wvil induce the public to bestir themselves until they have established a system of audit which shall be something better than a fiction and a snare." The public interest and welfare also demand imperatively that al official abstracts and statements of the public income and expenditure also shall be made in gross-i. e., palpable and plain for the public information, particularizing all details connected with sinecures to peers, &c., and that the " net" system be abolished totally, because its many meshes admit of delusive abstracts. It is hopeless to expect the present Government will, voluntarily, give up their favourite " net system ;" but it is to be hoped that the Administrative Reform Association will at once perform their especial public duty-i. e., publish the gross accounts of the public income and expenditure, and prove thereby its great public importance and utility. Whilo the questionable expenditure of millions of pounds sterling annually is disguised, officially, by the net system it is more than reprehensible to see the imaginary items of twelfth parts of pence delusively paraded. The " net system" is too grossly delusive to be any longer tolerated, as the subjoined ilustration must prove. I am prepared to give you further statements on this all important public question if you desire them. The subjoined short statement sufficiently illustrates the Fourth Official Statistical Abstract versus the Annual Official Finance Accounts, aud the deformity of the " net system," as well as the inutility of the public allowing themselves to be taxed some 90,0001. sterling per annum for such delusive publications. I am, Sir, very sincerely and truly Yours. A5N iMINIRTRATTV - London, April 30. TIE FOURTH OFFICIAL STATISTICAL ABSTRACT VERSUS THE AmNUAi OFFICIAL FIEANCE ACcouNTS.

LAW REPORT. COURBT OF OA1CERY. LWcoLN'S-Im. 3U.7 & TTARF. V- R1TRVM.' I'eJOrc the Los.D OuAscLOR and the LORDS JUSTIOES of APPRAT- Thi3 was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Wood. The bill was filed by Sir John Rare, and prayed !Peoiflo performance of e covenant in a lease granted by Lord Methuen to the defendant, to renew such lease upon payinent of a fine. The property included in the lease wa3 uilding land, situate at Badminster, and held upon lives. The defendant had purchased the fee simple in the land, and upon the dropping of one of the lives the plaintiff ap plied to him for a renewal of the lease in conformitr with a covenant to that effect in the original lease, bSt the defendant refused to comply with such request, ln the ground that the lease had been forfeited by the breach of a covenant in it to repair. The Vice-Chancellor decided that the objection of the defendant was not a valid one, and de. oreed specific performance of the defendant's covenaut with coats. From this decison the defendant appealed, but the arguments upon the appeal seemed direceted more to show that even if the plaintiff was entitled to his renewal the Vice-Chancenor was wrong in giving him the coats of the suit. Mr. Cairns, Mr. Wickens, ancl Mr. Dart appeared for the plaintiff, and, as it wam an appeal from the whole decree, opened the case. M r. Rolt and Mr. Batten were for the appellant. 'The LOBD CHANCELLOR delivered the judgment of the Court, and said that the decision of the Court below was perfectly correct. Possibly the defendant might have a right of notion against the plaintiff for his breach of covenant for not repairing the property, but that could not de. prive the plaintiff of his right to areLewal of the lease The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

The Attorney-General, Mr. Baily, and Mr. Hobhouse a- pdin support of the demurrer; Mx. Anderson and ir The support of the bilL The caso is stDl proceeding. (Befor V -OChancUor Svr W. P. WOOD.) LISTER V. LEATHER. mr. ROLT and Mr. H. STLVniNs moved, on behalf of the plaintifs, that the bill filed in this cause might be dismissed without costs, and that they might be at liberty to file another bill for the same matters, as they might be advised. The suit was instituted for the purpose of restraining an alleged infringement of the patent of the plaintiffs, and certain questions having been raised as to the novelty of the invention claimed by them, an action had been diroeted, and the plaintfi, having obtained a judgment in this actioni moved on Monday last for an injunction against the defendant. The defendant opposed the motion on the tech. nical ground that, under the statute 7th and 8th Vic. toria, cap. 83, sec. 1, it was enacted that when a patentee disclaimed a part of his invention the disclaimer could not be read in any suit pending when the disclaimer waa filed. The plaintiffs had amended their former bill subsequently to disclainming part of their invention. His Honour felt him. self bound by the objection and dismissed the motion for an injunction, at the same timeexpresing his dissatisfaction aF the course taken by the defendant, and not allowing hiun tho costs of the motion. Leave was then given to the plain. tiffs to serve notice of motion for Tuesday to dismiss their bill without costs, without prejudice to their right to comA maence another suit for the same matters. Mr. FlscsRs, on behalf of the defendant, opposed the motion, and contended that the plaintifis were bound upon dismissing their own bill to pay to the defendant his f1u costs, citing the statute 4th Anne, cap. 16, sec. 23, and various cases in support of his argument. The VXCE-CHAi;CELLOn, after observing that he entirely disclaimed entering into the merits of the case, which he had no power, indeed, to entor upon before the hearing, aid that from the provisions of the Patent Act (7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 83) the biU must have been dismissed, from the plantiffs having disclaimed a portion of their patent pendig the suit. l'he Court, however, wishing that ample justice should bedone, andthat the suit might proceed when this difficulty was removed, had made an order that upoia the cause coming on for hearing the plaintiffs should he at liberty to withdraw their replication, and that the costs of the defendant up to that period should be taxed and paid the defendant thus getting aU the benefit that he couli have got from the bill bein dismissed. The costs were accepted by the defendant, andthe biU remained on the file. Nor could e conceive why the defendant, having got all possible benefit, and without a chance of getting any additional benefit, should take such an objection, and insist that al the expense should have to be incurred over again by the plaintiffi. The case had been put in a state that it could be tried on the merits. 'Useless expense had been saved to everybody, and it appearet to be a proper case for allowing the plaintiffs to dismnss their bill without co0ts. As to his discretion under the statute cited, the Court oould always at the hearing dispose of the costa as it thought fit. According to the contention of the defendant, the Court must in"ist upon the expense of the case going on to a hearing to get at this same result, which the Court would then come to, to the still greaer detriment of this very defendant. }Ie acceded to the rule that he could not enter Into the merits before the heating, but he could enter into the conduct of the parties as to their conduct of the cause.

Barnwell, the head master of the Grammar Nchool at Ruthin, in the county of Denbigh, to show cause why a criminal information should not he filed against him for the mnsdemeanour of " undue influence," committed by him in violation of the 5th section of the Corrupt Practices' Prevention Act, 1854 (the 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 102). That section made it a misdemeanour to do or threaten any harm or loss to ay person to induce him to vote, or to refrain from voting, or on account of such person having voted, or refrained from voting at any election, and also zendered the offender liable to forfeit the smn of 501. to any person who should sue for the same. It appeared that at the last election for the Denbighshire boroughs there were two candidates, Mr. Townsend Mainwaring and Mr. James Maurice. A pol was demanded, and took place on the 30th of March. The Messrs. Trehearn, father andj son, were bakers in the market-place of Rathin and they supplied the Rev. Ifr. Barnwell weekly vwith all the flour and bread he required for his family establishment. They also made bread for Bishop Goodman's Charity, out of the funds of which 60 loaves were weekly given away by the churchwardens, and also to another charity (Thelwell's) which gave away 5 rworth of bread yearly. Both father and son had votes, and they were eagerly canvassed both for r. Mainwaring and his opponent, fMr. Maurice, but, according to the younger Trehearn's aidavit, he had ref-used to promise either side. He also said that at .abut 10 o'clock on the morning of the poll the Rev. Mr. Barnwell came to him, and pressed him to vote for Main. waring, but be answered that he had several persons to please besides Mr. Barnwell, and that he would either vote for Maurce or remain neuter. Mr. Barnwell then said he wonld be chazchwarden next year, and he threatened that if Trehearn would not come and vote for Mainwaring" he would take the charity bread away from him, he would do all he could against him, would look black at him, and take his own custom away from him. He called a second time, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and told Trehea-n's wife that if her husband did not vote for Main. waring hewould not make anymore "churchloaves,"mean. "Ig for Thelwelra Charity. At about half-past 12 o'clock Mr. Barnwell caled again, and asked Trehearn if his wife had told hbn what he bad said, and being informed that she had, he left, saying, "You must mind, then." Notwithstanding this intimidation both father and son went and voted for Maurice, but the latter lost the election, and Mainwaring was returned. From that day (the 30th of March) MIr. BarnweD had withdrawn his custom, and ceased to deal with the Trehearns. Sir F. THESIGER, Mr. MACAULAY, Q.C., and Mr. J. BROWS Uow showed cause against the rule, and produced affidavits made by the Rev. Mr. Barnwell and Mr. Mainwaring in which they denied the statement made by Trebearn, that he had not promised to vote for either of the candidates, for he had in Mr. Barnwell's presence promised Mr. Mainwaring to vote for him. Mr. Barmwell said he never stated to Trehearn, directly or indirectly, that he would take office as churchwarden to put him out of the bread, or that he would take the church bread from him if he voted for Maurice, nor did he hold out any threats, direct or indirect. He positively denied that he ever threatened that if he did not vote for Mainwaring he would do al he could against him, or threaten to take away his custom, or look blaclc on him, &c. The affidavit went into a lon statement of what really did occur, which was confirmed by another gentleman, named Clark, who on one of the occasmons accompanied him to Trehearn's house. He denied that he had made use of any violent language or intimidation to Trehearn and to his wife, and stated that he had withdrawn his custom because he had found that he (Trebeamn) had made false statements, was adaibgerous person, and unworthy of credit, and on no other account. Mr. SN1BB and Mfr. DOWfDES5'XLL were heard in sup. port of the rule, and contended that there was no distinct denial of some of the principal charges in the applicant's Lord wAPB,LL said that whfon this application was made to the Court the had felt bound to grant this rule to show Cause, and he (Lorcl Campbell) was still of opno tha if cae tenmade had been unanswered the Cour woul,did bre boendto makete rleabsolute. The Legislature thadassen Actake awayhich cred ca new offence, that of " u n d u e in luedon ce," an d the 5th se ction of th e statu te menacte that ( everd person w ho shall, diretly or im di reely b hisef,Or bY any other person on his behalf, makeuseof,or hretento make use of, any force, violence, or estait o iffit,or threaten the infliction, by himsel, o by orthrughany other person, of any injury, damae, hrm,Or loss, Or In any other manner practise in. timidato uPOn Or atgainist any person, in order to induce or compel such person to vote, or refrain from voting, or! on accunt of suchi On' having voted or refrainied firom voting, at any electi~on, he shall be deemed to have corn. mnitted the offence of undue inzlence, and shal b~e guilty of a misdemeanour, and ' shall also be liable to forfeit a sum of 504 to any person who shall sue for the same, together with funl costs of suit"2 Now, apmiei facie case for the application of the Act was clearly made out for it was stated that My. Barnwiu, with a view to Y'ntimidate a voter and to induoe him to vote, did threaten to takeaway the "1 church bread," and did threaten to take awayhils own custom, In eithercae there was intimidation within the meaning of the Aetof 'Parliao macnt. Ho (L-Ord Cambell) could not concury in theO mnc. eng *hlch had been put upon the Act daing tmhe argsmento dwhichwoullc makothe Acta-mresenbHti-viz that it merely forbae that which would have beenL unlawfu before. The Act created a new offence, and made that unlawful which 'was lawful before, provided it be done 'with a view to induce persons to vote or not to vote at the election of mombers of Parliamont Accordingly a threat to withdraw the charity bread riad even to withdraw his own outom, mnade dunntde elecUton, would h ave been an infringementof the Act o-fParliament. After the election was over of cose evary eun would be at liberty to employ whom he pleased as his tradesmen, hut not during the election -to threaten that he would withdraw his custom. That was just the same as if a landlord were to say,-" You are MY tenant from year to year, and ualess you vote for my candidate I 'will give you notice to quit, and turn you out of the house." To prevent such threats being made tue Of during the election the present Act of Parliment was sse.In reference to the affidavits which had been d inat inswer his Lrdship observed that he wished the denial 'which they contained had been more pointed, more eategoricae and more satisfactory;e but at thed se time he thought they were in substa~nce a denial of the charge. Ho (Lord Campbell) could not agree with the argument used by Mr. Dowdeawel, that where the case was dloubtful the Court interfered ixn this summary manner. The practice was for the Court to say, ia he now said, that another coursewasopen,andtbeproseoutor could Proceed bY indictment. This was a miademeanourt over which a dad juryof Denbighahire hadoogmiance,anditwEtsg orth prosecutor to have recourse to that tribunaL His Lordship thought that Mr. Barnwell had substantialy answeredl the imputation cast upon himn, and hie had brought out the fact that Treheamr (the applicant) had agreed to vote for Mainwaring, and sho wed tht his c Trebeans) affidpvits were not sincere, and that he had ield facts which ought to have been broght before the Court. oUnder all the aircunatinces he (Lordanmpbll)was of opnon that the rule ought to be discharged ; but seengwhat was disclosed here, on both sides, and that amnattenipt 0was made to abuse public charities, the rule would be oharged withoutf ostsv Yhr. Justice Ein sid he was of the same opeor in The object of the statute ws that the voter should bo allowqd to exercise hisr calm judgment, without beig disturbed by selfish motives, to pro etihimtfrom threats hafoting his private interesto2 Hs Lordship thought the charges were substantialy ydenied, though notecf callyh andsome parts weme unsatisfactorily answered. Mr. JUStice CRsuOMON expressed himself in agreement with the rest of the Court, and said he entertained no doubt that it wars a 1S adeeanour to thradten to take tay coutom. Rule discharged, without costs. THEN QUEEN V. LOWE. Mr. Powizea moved for a rule calling upon John Lowe, thprinter andpubliaher of the lose-ofthcam ChrOnicke an4h Pat-is Begiseri, to shOw cause whY a crimi'nal informa3tiOn should not be filed against him for a libel pubtlshed by hi in that jounal on the 14th of Ap r 1857. The application was made on the part of W.

Mr. POWELL stated that in the year 1850 the applicant was the honorary secretary of a Working Man's Institution at Cheltenham, and he was advised that the members might be made voters by having the building conveyed to them which was accordingly done. c Lord CAuBELL said the Court would not have inter. fered if this had been a fair comment; but the article went a great way beyond that, and asailed the private character of the appaicant. The learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted, nI RE TEIOES FRANCIS RICRHADS, AN ATTORNEX. In this case a rule had been granted to strike an attorney, named Thomas Francis Richards, off the roll of this Court, upon the ground that he had been convicted of embezzile. ment in May, 1856, before the Assistant-Judge at West. minster. Mr. Eerjeant Pigott and Mr. Huddleston now appered to show cause against the rule. Lord CAMPBELL.-If the judgment remains unreversed, is he to remain one of the officers of this Court s Mr. Serieant PIGoTT submitted that the question for the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, was, whether, under all the circumstances, it would be safe to allow him' to re. Lord CAMNBL said it was a fixed rule in such a case for the party to be strack off the roll; ib would be unbecoming that such a person should be allowed to appear to be on the rolL Mr. Serjeant PFIGoT submitted that it was a question for the discretion of the Court, under the circumstances. Lord CAMPBELL,.-Not where a judgment of felony stands unimpeached. Mr. Justice ERLE said it was a rule of law which the Court was bound to enforce. Mr. Justice CRompTox thought it was always a matter of course Mr. Serjeant PIGoTT said that after that strong expression ef opinion he should not be doing his duty to press the matter; but he trusted he should not be precluded from applying to the Court at a future opportunity. lArd CASPBini said,-Certainly not. M r. Garth, who appeared in support of the rule, was not Rule absolute. STURGIS V. THE BTSHOP OF LONDON. The plaintiff in this action was the offlcial assignee of an insolvent clergyman, and the action was brought to try whetblr a writ of levans facia lodged with the bishop by the official assignee was to take priority over a similar writ lodged with the bishop at a prlor date by a judgment creditor named Dawson. The facts of the case were subsequently stated in a special case for the opinion of this Court, and the Court last week, upon argament, decided that, as the first writ was not lodged in order to be executed, but only with instractions, notice should be given of any subsequent writ that might come into the office, the writ lodged by the plaintiff was entitled to have pnority. Sir F. THaESIGER (with whora was Mr. J. Addison) now moved to make the rule absolute, no cause being shown. Mr. BAi)Emxy applied that the bishop should be allowed his costs of appearing. Lord CAmPBELL said the Court would say nothing about costs, but merely make the rule absolute. The bishop's officers ought not to have received the writ with such instructions, and they hai done their best to favour one side. Rule absolute.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WEST3M=KR, MAY 5. (Sittings in Banco, laster Tcrm.) The Court to-day heard causes shown against several rules. All the arguments, however, were on Points of so technical a nature as to be devoid of any publc interest. (SMinga at Nisi Pinus, at Westminster, before Mr. Justicc Wnrnusss and a Common Jury.) CLARKE V. PAICE. Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., Mr. Pickering, Q.C and Mr Harcourt appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr.Huddleston was counsel for the defendant. This was an action brought by the plaintiff, Mrs. Clarke, to recover damages from the defendant, who, on the 28th of May £n last year, was a livery stable-keeper, for the alleged negligence of his servant in driving a chaise on that day out of Addingtonsuare, CamberweDl, whereby he was said to have inflioted serious injuries upon the plaintiff-a lady somewhat advanced in year The evidence, as is usual in the class of cases called " runnin down oases," was of a most contradictory nature. According to the plaintiff, she was knocked down and trampled on by the defendant's horse; while his witnesses deposed thatl rs. Clarke fell from nervouness or some other cause, and that the defendant's chaise was drawn up at twro feet distance from her without touching her, Mr. HUDDLSTON, in suminig up his case to the jur, contended that the abrasions on the andes of Ms Clre were caused by her having accidentally struck a atone in falling, and her maininjuries were to be traced to a severe sprain oocadoned by the fall itelf.

The porter said his orders were imperative; poverty andhunger were nothing to him; he had done his duty. The master h said that neither she nor anr one else could be admitted, and therefore admitted she would not be. The poor woman, however, was not to be trned away in that manner, and so she took up some stones and breke some panes of glass of the vain. of Is. 9d. She did not quit the spot, and when the policeman came up and took her nt custedy she said snehad done it, and that she now knewv thst she should have a night's lodging and be treated kindly. ~ ~ ~ ~ n b "e Mr. COBBIE said relief should have been given to the ndant, and then inquired In at parish she had slept Defendant.-At Wandsworth, Sir. From that place I walked until I came to the Clerkenwvll workhouse, aud 'When I got there I was vver exhausted and hungry. Mr. CORRIE.-Do you belong to the parisk of Wandsworth ?-No, Sir, I am a D tive of the city of Cork, bat have been in this country for 40 years. Mr. COnnix said he should order the defendant to pay the value of the glass, or, in default of payment, to be sent to the House of Correcthon for seven days. HIe supposed thtshe would sooner be in prison than wFandering about The prisoner was then removed. William Davis, who has been remanded several times on the charge of obtaining money under false pretences, was again placed at the bar for re-examination Mr. John Wakeling appeared for the prosecution. The case, as on the previous occasions, excited a great deal of interest, and the court was crowded with the victims of the prisoner and his companionWilliams. Owing to the active exertions of Sergeant Hill, 39 S, it has been ascertained that, in addition to the several systems of fraud that have already been published, they have been in the habit of obt nin Isrge amounts of money by advertising for pezns to ioin tnem inbusiness. Mr. Wakeling said that every day brought fresh oases of fraud to light. There could be no doubt that this was the break-up of one of the most extensive systems of fraud that had been dicovered for some time James Creary was then called, and stated that he had been defrauded of 101. by the prisoners. Mr. James Handyside, the landlord of the house, 2a, Judd-street, preferred a charge of felony against the prisoner,-viz, that of stealing a quantity of plateglass and gasfittings. Mr. COBBIZ said he had received a large number of letters complauiingof theprlsoner's frauds. He vouldbe cominitted for trial on the chares already proved a.ainst him, bbut wsould be remanded until Saturday on the charge hThe prisoner, wrho had nothingto say in his defence, was ISergeant Hill who has charge of the case, said that he prisoner had had 12 monthb' for stealing his masters Mr Wakeling asked if the recognizances of Vickes, the soliiCtor, had been estreated. r.ORRIE said that would be attended to. They were estreated on the last occasion. THAMZO.On Saturday last EHenry Hills, aged 59, the assistant-clerk of tho Poplar 'Union, and whose wife and tvo daughters kept a girls' school in Grundy-street, Poplar was brouht before Mr. YARDLEY charged on the police. sheet with indecently asaulting two girls, papils of his wife, named Anna Stamp, aged 10, and Louisa idman, aged 12 In tho first case there w,S some evidence of a felony having been committed, but the magistrate ultimately decided on committing the prisoner for a misdemeanour on two charges. A third case ws partially gone into, and a police-constable, named Martin, No. 4413, said there were six or seven other cases of a similar descrption against the prisoner, and the witnesses were in court. The father of one of the girls said that a doctor who had examined his child was of opinion some violence had boen offered to her. The magistrate said he thought he was best consulting tho feelings of the prents and their children in not prolonging the ivestigation, and that as far as ws consistent with publio justice he woul spare the feelings of the inured people before him. Yeerday Mr Gra & re pectble medica practitioner in Poplar came befre Mr. Yardley, and stated that a report of the examination of the Hills which ad appearoed in thA nen tiars s lkely to do him considerable in' i his =r i he suffered it to remain unnotioed. lofr h S be one of the chldre, w repoe o aid thatD Gray h waited upon him a im the matter and not a ne a certainly waited on Mr. Stapi eaint h hre aint A".

The bodies of William Thompson and Harrison, who was his "1 trammer," were found at the top of the fourth board. 8ate on the south side of the pit, where they were at work at the time of the explosion; while those of Hunt and Smith were discovered in a slit between the third and fourth boardgates, having probably attempted to escpe on the occurrence of the explosion and been arrested by the noxious gas. The fifth body was brought out at 8 o'clock this morning, and bee not been identified. It wss found floating in the water in the dip level to the south, and was in a shockingly decomnposed state. The remaining three bodies making up the eight were brought out at noon to-day, by the men whose shift or turn terminated at that time. They were found near the face or end of the north leveL. Two of them were at once very satisfactorily identified as those of John Frost, of West ISelton, a married man, 32 years of age, and of Charles Kallott, ay~outh who bad iived at Womnbweli. Att 3 o'clock the third body bed not been identified, but was expected to be so, as there were several peculiarities -about the dress. A number of the bereaved were present when the three last named bodies ware brought out of the pit, and followed them in mournful silonoce to the receptioa shed where they were placed by the other bodies. The body of George Dyson, recovered yesterday, has been interred to-day in the churchyard as Wath-upon-Dearne. The mniners who have undertaken the task of restoring the pit and recovering the bodies are at present engaged in removing the vast accumulation of debris at the bottom of the ventilting shaft. Thare is no doubt that at the timle 'of the explosion: from 20 to 30 Drsons were congregated in the space covered by those faZl of earth. It has always been feared that the remnains of these bodies would not be found, as they were e:psed to the full vehemence of the trific fire which broke out there. The miners carefully examined the earth as they remuoved it, but have not hitherto been able to discover any remains of a single body in that part of the pit. After these large faUls of earth shall have bceen removed, it is expected that the bodies will be recovered with much .greater rapidity. foun nertefc_renio ot
RAILWTAY ACCIDENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. 'Sir,-On my arrival in England my attention was ealled to a leader in your journal of the 10th of last month on the subject of -railway accidents in this country, and I was forcibly struck by your remarks that, although the average of those accidents has been of late much reduced, it still remains too large, inasmuch as its height is raised by preventible causes. In Germany, especially in Prussia, the system of working raUways is very different, and far prefeor.ble .to that adopted by the English directors. I was for some years one of the chief officers of the Cologne and Minden Company, extending over about 200 miles, and it has the reputation of being one of the best conducted lines on the Continent. By proper regulations, the average of accidents on that line has been reduced as nearly as possible to a misrimuun. Durng a penGd ofi &SiX years only two travellers have been injure; tre.one metwith his death inconsequence of the train running off the unrail, he being found dead in the -carriage without-any injury 'being discovered on his per. son; the other-recklessly jumped out of the carriage while it was in motion and broke his leg. Although that company is worked with a single line and tail for a long distance, arid as mauy as froma 52 to 58 trains per diem pass over it, such a circumstance as one train runniug.into another while stationary, or two meeting each other whi'ie in motion, .is unheard of. Here, on the contrary, it frequently bappens, and it is attributable to a manifest error -in the management. In Prussia the administration *off railways is under the strong control not only of exprienced boards of direction and subordate off icers, but also of commissioners appolinted by the Government. The trains are obliged to start with punctuality, and at *reglar hours. From station to station their ansival and departure are announced by the electrio and aerial or hand telegraph. One train is not .permitted to follow another at a less * distance than one English mile. At convenient posts, so as to be in sight of each other, there are stationed certain signalmen called bahnwcaerter, whose duty it is to sot in motion the aerial or hand telegraph by day, and to signal each other with lamps by night, aac -of these men is located in a small hut, over which is,placed a clock, ocmmunicated with by the electric 'wire, and he has full control of that part of the line which is entrusted to his care or look out. When unemployed in the abovementioned manner his time is occupied in plate laying, and it is a part of his business to keep his portion of the road in perfect good order as well as to arrange the -points. With respecttothe trains the greatestcareand precaution -ar taken. Each of them- is under the sumerintendence of a chief guard (zrgfii hrer), in whom is vested full discretionary ,powers the moment it leaves the station; under him are sub-guard, (scltiaffner), who attend the tra-a?llers, collect the ticke ts, see that the doors of the carriages are closed and riot opened .wkjle the traincis in motion, &c. Two carriages are assigned to the guardianship of each of these men. Every alternate carriage is fitted with a break, and on its roof sits a breansSman, who works ib according to the signals These breaks,<soarranged, Are of thegreatestimportance with respect to afety, becaue the indefnite increase of the l ength of the- tran does noS, .as is the case in lnglan-d, in-denitely increaso the weightwhich a limited and stationary break powver has to overcome, -but every addit'onal weight , rngs with it thle necessaw .contralling force. When danger iS apprehended the whistle is sounded and the breaks -are 'rapidly and simultaneously applied, the consequence of which is that by means of their enormous coective pover a stopp4ge is effected in from .80 to 100 yards in ordinary, and from 150 to200 yards on express trains, ihis latter -limit, however, -does not *require-hetezercise of the full io wer of the breaks, -which is put on in. cases af sudiden and .peculiar emergency. As another precaution, the main guard is provided vwith.a portable battery, instruments, and a iladder, so that heocan in Jcase of a breakdown communicate instantaneously with the nextstation by puttiu6 his battery in union wi5,h the main wise. -In the statienmaster 'is .vesteid a discretion-to prevent any train from sarting vwien he has receiodea totification of danger on anW part of theline. In submitting At2 the public through your widely-circuJated jornril these -observations, the result of practical cxpeonence, I a.q,uite aware-that the adopion in this country ,of the Prusaian.principallythe Cologne andMiudezi)system -of working would invl1ve an increase of expenditure by the ,augmentation of the necessavy staff; the dividends, however, of the Prussian rrilways, aotwithstanding this outlay, pay on an avage from 8 4-t 9 per cent. per annum ; ameo of then yieldfron 9 to n, and a few X much as 16 per cent. This lucrative result, in comparison with bhe English dividends, is, in my opinion, traceable rather to he-s nonexistence of duplicate and competing lines abroad thasn to the lesser eost of construction and workingexpenses.

At the weelly meeting held last night a reply was received from Lord Carlisle to the address forwarded to his Excellency by way of explaaation or apology for the offensive passage in the memorial which led to the suspension. of relations between the Castle and the Dublin Protestant Association. Here is the vioeregal rejoinder:- "1Duablin Castls, April 30. "Sir,-Havig laid before the Lord Lieultenant your. letter of the hllt., with its accompanying address directed to acquaint you that bis Excellency, looking upon the address as a withdrawal of the obnoxious alnputatina in the communication addressed to his Excellency on the 13th ult., will not at present think himself caed upon to depart from the course he has previously pursued. ' I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "W. R. Furlong, Esq." "THOSrA A. LARcom. Colonel BOYEs moved that the letter be inserted on the minutes. Mr. THoMsoPN, in seconding the motion, said he was sure that none of them could for a moment in anything; which they had said mathe address have contemplate using any personal expressions respeotig Lord Carliue. He was convinced that a more amiable, hospitable, or honourable nobleman thanhis Excellency never adorned the position of Viceroy. The address was sent to him merely in his capa. city as Lord Lieutenant. ROZILANCES OF ClfANCEBY. The great will cae of C hRosborough F . Boyce" came on yesterday in the Court of Chancery for rehearing for further directions, and upon motion on the Part of the defendant to change the venue from the county of Wer1ford to the county of Dublin, the House of Lords having, on appeal, granlted a senire d.e noto last session. The following is anl outline of the proceedings:- " The issue, it will be recolected, was as to the validity of the will of COnsar Colciough, who died in 1842, leaving real estates worth about 10,0001. per annum, and considerable personal property, all of which was claimed by his widow (the defendant), who is now Mrs Boyce, as devisee under the deceased's will. The plaintiff, after the lapse of seven years, disputed the validity of the will, alleging that undue influence was used to obtain its execution, and, as heir-atlaw of the deceased, asserted his title to the property enjoyed by the defendant. Litigation in the equity courts followed, and finally the Chancellor directed an issue to be tried as to whether the wil of C. Colelough was a valid testamentary document or not. Eminent counsel were engaged on both sides, and after a lengthened trial the jury found a verdict against the wil and in favour of the p aintiff. A new trial was sought for and refused by the Chancellor, who, on the I9th of April, 1853, pronounced a decree putting the plaintiff in possession of the estate. Subsequent orders were likewise obtained by the plaintiff, directing, as consequential upon the decree, payment of the inesne rents received by the defendant while in possession of the estate and costs. All this has been reversed by the recent judgment of the House of Lords, which orders a new trial of the issue, and has remitted the cause to the Chancellor to give such other directions as may be necessary to carry out the judgment of the House of Lords, with all consequential directions, and among these there is mentioned a power to chang,e the venue. " 'he Solicitor-General, with Messrs. Brewster, Q.C., and Lawson, Q.C., appeared for the defendant, and on the hearing for further direction caled upon the Chancellor, as consequential upon the judgment of the House of Lords, to restore Mrs. Boyce, the defendant, to the possession of the estates; to direct the plaintiff to refund the amount of the rents received by him during the four years he had been Inpossession, and to repay the defendant the money she had paid on account of costs. "Messrs. Whiteside, Q.C,, Francis Fitzgerald, Q.C,, and RX Walshe, Q.C., appeared on the other side. "For the defendant it was argued that a decree of the ChanceUor, dated the l9th of April, 1853, putting the plaintiff into possession of the estates, had been reversed by the judgment of the House of Lords. The Chancellor had no discretion but to restore possession of the property to the p3rty from whom it had been taken by an erroneous decree -that as the plaintiff had no title whatever till the decree was pronounced now that it was declared erroneous the de. fendant should be remittedto her original esiton-and that the plaintiff, who at the present stage of the cause should be regardedasan unsuccessful pretender, shenldnotbeallowcdto carry on litigation with the usurped money of his adversary For the sane reasons the plaintiffshouldbedirected to bring in the rents and to repay the costS which the defendant, by the order of the Chancallor, had been obliged to pay. The terms of the judgment of Lord Cranworth in the House of Lords were quoted to show that the highest tribunal, after hearing all the facts of the case, were of opinion that there was no evidence sufficient to prove that the will in question was invalid on account of undue influence being used by the defendant to obtain its execution. *' For the plaintiff it was contended that the House of Lords, in directing a new trial, affirmed the order of the Chancellor, ordering an issue to be tried to decide the rights of the parties, that these rights were as 3 et undetermined, and that consequently the defendant should not be put in possession of the subject-matter of the litigation, but everything remain as it tthen was till the result of the second trial, which would take place in about eight weeks, was ascertained. The arguments on both sides were very voluminous, and included a reference to cases bearing upon the points in dispute. "The Chancellor, in giving judgment, observed that the causes had been remitted back to carry out the order for a new trial of the issue, and to give such usual or proper directions as the Court might deem proper respecting the reception of the evidence on such new trial, and upon these points there existed no doubt. But then the next question arose,-andit was this :-Whatfwere the other directions to be given, founded upon the decree of the House of Lords? That tbunal had declared the decree null and void by virtue of which the plaintiffs had been put into possession, and having set 'hat decree order aside, the result would appear to be to restore the parties to the position which they occupied prior to that period. However, it had been said it contained a direction which not only determined what was to be done, but what was not to be done, and that when the House of Lords directed that the sum of money brought in by Mrs. Boyce should remain in the Court of Chancery until the result of another trial, they declared inferentially that everything else should remuain in its present position, as not being otherwise provided for. lHe, however, considered that the fact of providing for the retention of this sum of money in court went to show that where it was otherwise tintended provlsion was made that the reversal of the decree should not have all the consequential results calculated to flow from it. He (the Chancellor) saw great inconvenience in carrying out the rule by changing the possession when a trial was to take place very soon, and when there might ultimately be a verdict binding upon this Court and upon the House of Lords -a verdict to be followed by a new decree re-enacting the restoration of the possession to the plaintiff.E His Lordship concluded by stating that in conformity with his view of wbat was the tenour of the decree of March last he would make an order for restoring the possession to tho defendant MIrs. Boyce, and For the repaymuent of the costs of the issue p,aid by her, but he would not now make any order respectrng the rents of the estate received by the plaintiff." TEHE FU'IDS. Three per Cent.

The doUble contest for the Professorships of Poetry and ohltical Economy which had to be decided to-day attracted large numbers of non-residents to Oxford, who began to arrive soon after 11 o'clock. The Vice-Chancellor andthe two Proctors having takentheir seats at afew minutes past 12 the polling for the Poetry Professorship commenced, and was carried on with great spirit till 2, when there was a very perceptible lull. It is a peculiarity of University elections that the numbers are not announced or exhibited until the close, and conjecture as to the state of the poll 'was altogether at fault until a little after 2 o'clock, when some inquisitive eyes had discovered that Mr. Arnold was 40 or 50 votes in advance of his antagonist. At 3 o'clock the voting for the second Professorship began, and there was again a considerable crowd, but not equal to that of the earlierpart of the day. Soon after 4 the first aunonucenuent 'was made of an intention to close, by a summons from the Esquire Bedel in Arts to the Masters toproceed immnediately to tender their votes. This summons having been twice repeated, the interesting operation of burning the voting papers commenced; after. which the Vice-Chancellor and Proctorsidft the polling table, and, having tat-en tlrcirordinary seats, amid a breathless slenoe, declrd the reslts as foulows:- FOR TH.

A A T -LE lArZLWA Y INTELLIGBNCE. T.YONR ANT lT'P1T?.PP AXTV A AXr The general meeting of this company was held on Thurslay at Pans; AL Dumon, the president, in the chair. The meeting having been declared duly constituted, M1. REY DP FOISEsTA, one of the directors, read the report; which stated that the works on the Lyons and Avignon line might he considered as finished, the tota expense being l00,500,000f. (4,020,0001.). The branch from Pognac to Aix had been opened to the public in October last, and the cost was about 6,600,000f. (264,0001.). The works on the line from Mar-seilles to Toulon were being urged on with energy. The two great tunnels of Mussaguet and Jeanncts, ehe former 2,510 yards, and the latter 1,630 yards in length, were advancing satisfactorily, considerin that they were being cut through the solid rock. Dfficult as the works on this line were, there was every expectation that it would be completed by the 1st of March, 1859. The total cost would be 41,500,00f. (1,620,0001.) On the line from Avignon to Marseiiles provision at the stations was being made for the augmentation of the traffic; andwhen completed thecost would be 6,500,000f. (260,0001.). The enlargements and additional accommodation effected on the lines on the right bank of the Rhone would be, when finished, 5,500,OOOf. (220,0001.). The expense of the stock of every kind required for the working and repairs had amounted at the end of 1856 to 30,574,806f. (1,222,9921.); but when aUl the orders were executed the total would be 52,659,189f. (2,106,3671.). The whole cost was now estimated at 212,000,0001. (8,480,0001.), being an increase of 25,513,400f. (1,020,5361.) over the estimate of 1855. As the resources of the company amounted to 181,329,5892f. (7,253,1831.), there remained a deficit of 30,670,418f. (1226,817.), which it would be necessary to provide for. The traffic receipts for 1856 amounted to 30.236,410r (1,209,4561.), and the expenses to 11,787,787f. (47L5111.), leaving a net profit of 18,448,623f. (737,9451.), which sum, after the interest on loans, the sinking fund, stamps, &c., had been paid, would give a dividend of 117f. per share. As 30f. had been already distributed, the remaining 87f. would be paid at the offices of the company on and after the 1lth of M7ay. The reserve fund at present amounted to 615,096f., a sum of 428,678f. (17,1471.)having been expended in consequence of the damage done by the inundations. The Puns and Lyons and Lyons and Mediterraneau Railway Companies,would be amalgamated under the name of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Comyany. The two boards would reimain in office until 1862, and the general business would be conducted bg a joint committee of the two boards. One share of tne Mediterranean Company would be represented by two shares in the amalgamated company, and two Paris and Lyons shares would be represented by three shares in the new company. The eapital of the two companies would then be represented by 577,500 shares in the new or amalgamated company; 115,500 newshares are to be issued and offered rateably to the holders of the 577,000 shares just mentioned; and 107,000 shares are to be in part appropriated to meeting the engagements entered into with the Lyons and Genova Company, the other part being placed in reserve, to be negotiated afterwards. The total number of shares in the company would be 800,000. The board would have power to issue 600,000 bonds of 5u0f. each, giving 15f. interest per annum, for the purpose of carrying out the engagements entered into with the Grand Central and Orleans companies for the purchase of the lines lying in the space situated between the two railways, and to meet the expense of works on the new lines. The meeting then passed the accounts and adopted the dividend proposed of U7f. per share. It also ratified the treatyentiered into for the amalgamation, and authorized the board tonegotiate the bonds requiredformeeting the expenses of the new works. The proceedings then terminated. LONDON GENERAL OMINIBUS COMPANY. The adjourned annual meeting of this company was held in Paris, MI. Vacossi in the chair. The report, which was of considerable length, was read. It stated that the company commenced operations on the 7th of January, 1856, by receiving its first omnibuses, and they continued to receive others until the number reached 60. T-he profits realized in the year 1856 amounted to 121 per cent, of the capitaL. The result of the working of the first three months of 1857 is stated to he equivalent to 15 per cent, on the capitaL. The balance-sheet shows a total of 1,086,2S6t,, including umissued shares on both sides to the amount of 200,00 The funds of the company are composed of issued shares to the amount of 800.0001., and unissued shares to the amount of 200,0001., together 1,000,0001. The 600 omnibuses, with all their appurtenances, cost 10,000.v00f. (400,000t.). In addition to this, the sum of 1,202,714f. (48,1081.) has been expended for the purchase of new omnibuses, for the increase of the number of horses, and for various improvements in the stock. The report explains that the company have in reserve 26,312 shares for payment of 210 omnibuses,which were agreed to be delivered to the company, but, as they raun on rather poor lines of road, and as some of them would expose the company to considerable loss, it is proposed to enter into arrangements with the contractors to modify the original agreement, so as to euable the oompany to reduce the number of omnibuses still to be delivered ; and also the capital of the comipany to the extent of 120,0001. The receipts from the omnibuses during the year, amounted to 11,370,749f. (454,8301.), being at the rate of 70.19f. (2t. 16s.) per day for each omnibus. The number of horses employed averaed 41 d The advertisements in omnibuses d31,592f. pr a.). The interest on the unemployed capital produced 380,562f. (15,2221.). The sundry receipts, which form together a sum of 4S5,S19f. (19,4321.), added to the products of the traffic, bring the total revenue to the sum of ll,S6,568f. (474,262.), so that each omnibus earned 73-1Sf. and each horse 7-25f. per day. The working expenses of every description amounted to 9,996,577f. (399,8631.). The general expenses, including rents and management, amounted to 19,0401., the wages of drivers and conductors to 77,6801., Government duty, licenses, and tolls to 51,6311., oompensation for accidents to 418 ; inspection, 2381. ; maintaining and renewing omnibuses, &c., 35,4661. ; feeding horses, 171,8401, or 2s. 14d. per day for each horse. The other expenses connected with the horses, shoeing. attendance, and depreciation amounted to 43,6571., or-5s. 44d. perday for each omnibus, making, with the food, 11. 6s. 7d. per day. The whole of the expenses average 61-70f. for each omnibus and 6.11f. for each horse. The number of omnibuses averaged 450 per day. Each omnibus had run 54 miles, representing for the 4o0 omnibuses 24,300 miles per day. The average work of each horse had been 12 miles per day. The net profit earned by each omnibus was 11-48f. per day for the year ending December 31, 1856. 600 omnibuses, having 5,879 horses to work them, formed now the working stock.

THE DESTRUCTION OF YOUVG SAL&,I[OY. TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am very glad to see in 2ie limes of this date that a gentlemin so able as Dr. Esdaile to point out the source of wealth which artificial salmon-breeding offers has drawn the attention of the publio to the losses whichL yearly arise from the destruction of smolt. An it is not generally known how much has been done by the Legislature to prevent this waste of haman food, you may not think it v useless pursuit of the subject to. draw attention tco the existing penal enactments agains i killing the young of salmon, known by the varions denominations of smolt. salmon spawn, penks, and pars, espe cially asthe penalties imposed by some Acts of Parliament on this subject do not appear in the books to which magistrates generally have access. Statute lst of Elizabeth, c. 17, prohibits the taking of salmon less than 16 inches, by any device, on pain of 20s. fme and loss of the engine of tanzg. By the 30th of Charles IIL, 0. 9, the above penalty was raised to 40s. for doing any act whereby the spawn of fish may be destroyed; and by the 1et of George L, sec. 2, c. 18, the penalty was raised to 6L. as regards the rivers Severn, Dee, WVye, Teamie, Were Tees, Ribble, Miersey, Dum, Air, Ouse, Ssraile, Calde,ghrREr,Dret and Trent.de,'hf,Er,Drnt And although the 22d of George IL c. 49, remits the penalty in respect of fishataken with a hook, the remission was found to work so badly that by the 33d George IL, c. 27, the penalty of 2& was restored to its original application, and even imposed on persons having in POsSession spawn, fry, or brood of fish; andthe 68thGeorge G1., c. 43 raises the penalty to 101. (vwith a limit of mitigation to 5l.), or, in default, imprisonment for not less than two months, or 6ix or eight months if the offence be repeated. In addition to the above there is an unrePealed statute of the 3d James L, c. 12, imposinga penalty of -IO for destroying spawn or fry. A. company with which I am connected, proposing to breed salmon, put an end to the destruction of smolt on the river Dart this season by placarding a list of some of the penalties which I have noticed, and by letting it be well understood that offenders would be strictly prosecuted. Until this course had been taken numbers of boys daily killed from 100 to 300 smolt each. It is probable that the whole subjecb of salmon fishing will be submitted to Parliament at an early period, and such improvements made in the law as will give to the proprietors of the banks of salmon streams a common interest mn preserving the brood. One measure which may be practicable is the annexing to the proprietary of the banks shares in the rentil of the fisheries of the river, the shares to be numbered, and to be susceptible of division, an' perhaps of subdivision; so that each proprietor of a bank would hold shares in preportion to the extent of his bank; and, in selling a Fp of it would incidentally sell a proportionate part of his shares in the rental of the fishery. Some reguMations in analogy with those of turnpikes might be adopted for letting, and provisions made for compensating existing proprietors of fisheries by allotting to them shares in the total rental of the fisheries of the river, unless other means would better meet the justice of the particular case. My ownu inquiry has convinced me that such a measure of te Legislature would be well receivedby a vast number of landed proprietors, whose estates are invaded for the destruction of salmon. I am. Slr. vour obedient servant. FRAN0IS RP.NWT1 AT.T. 22, Lincoln's.inn-fields, May 4. TO THE EDITOR OF TH}E TIMES. Sir,-It is with great satisfaction that I see by Dr. Esdaile's letter, in your impression of to.day, that TSe Times has opened its columns to so important a subject as that of salmon breeding and rearing in the rivers of this country. It cannot be too broadly or decidedly asserted that, as matters aregoing on now, thisis nolongera question of comparative supply, of scarcity or of abundance, but of any supply at all, of the continuance of the species, or of the utter extinction of the breed in al English and Welsh waters. In Scotland the private rights in valuable rivers are suficiently well defined to insure defence for the fish from motives of self-interest to the owners; and in Ireland a new and progressively improving code of laws is conferring benefits and ensurng w ealth to the public nvers and waters of Ireland, which are as yet denied us in England. Let the inefficiency of our lavs to protect the fish, and the importance of the subject, as a source of national wealth only, have an opportunity of coming before the public, and of being fully ventilated in the columns of Shre Times, an d I shall have little doubt of obtaining what has long been wanted, and which some of us have striven in vain to obtain-viz., an adaptation of our fishery laws to the demands of the present times, and to the changed circumstances which have aisen since the days from which our present laws date. Having been for the last five years actively engaged in endeavouring to restore to its former abundance as a salmon river one of the finest which the west coast of England can boast, and having also had the rnanagement of a salmon nursery on its banks for raising the fish by artificial process, from which we last year turned out 1O,000youngralmon, I am naturally in possession of some practical expeinence on the subject; and I entirely agreo with Dr. Esdaile that so long as the young fry are destroyed in this or any other river in the wholesale manner which the law now permits, the means now in our power of either raisinDorprotecting the salmon are of little avail,aud, though very important as secondary efforts where the laws are good, are useless so long as the existing system continues. .Dr. Esdaile has scarcely, if at alL exaggerated facts in describing a number of small penks, or salmon fry, as sold for Is. 6cd., which, if permitted to go down to the sea, might have been counted on as realizing in the short space of six weeks later a sum of 5. Such a proportion in value is, in. deed, quite analogous to other articles of food in their different stages, except that we never think of consuming these wvhen they are so young as to be nearly valueless, and that they, if anmual, require feeding, if vegetable, tending, during the interval of their reaching maturity, whereas the salmon wants neither. What are the statutes on which we have to rely in endeavouring to protect the salmon in this country? Why, wo must go back toGeorgeIl., GeorgeII., GeorgeL, aud Queen Elizabeth; aye, and in extreme cases, even beyond Magna Charha. Thus, while science has opened to us a world of facts as to the breeding, the habits, the food, and the growth of the fish, with many other features attending theirexistenoe, as if providentiallytoenable man successfully to provide against the destruction attendant on improved dra-mage, greater facilities for fishing, an immensely increasing navigation of our rivers, and other circumstances following the traiu of a multiplied population, commerce, and manufactures, sti the LegIlature is deaf to any demand for change in a code of laws which was made in utter ignorance of all that is now so clearly revealed to us, and made, too, in times when no such exigency required a more stringent preservation of the species. I repeat, tbat it is now, with regard to the rivers of England and Wales, a question simply as to the continued existence of the breed of salmon, or of its entire externination. Is this a question of so little importance as to be beneath the notice of the Ledslature of this country? Is it of no consequence that in one river after another the species of salmo salar should be suffered to die out and disappear, depriving England of a source of wealth which cost no labour anu required no food? Let Adam Smith auswerthat query. But, in the meanwhile, and until wo obtain some such revisal of the fishery laws as will meet the necessities of the case, what shall we do to prevent the wholesale destruction of the fry complained of by Dr. Esdaile? The plan we have adopted in the Dee is as follows :_ Thelanded proprietors over about 20 miles of the upperpart of the river, and where the frywere most taken, have agreed together to close the river adjoining their propertiesfrom all fishing with the rod, except by ticket, and from all netting whatever. AU salmon fry, when accidentally taken by tho rod, are returned to the river; and any person taking those fish wilfully, or offering theLs for sale, is for the future debarred from fishing in the preserve on any terms. But the most important rulo of all is, that the preserve is closed entirely, both to rod and net, from the 31st of October to the 25th of March following, and constantly watched, so that the fish are left (as partridge andq?heasants are left) quietly to breed during the breeding season. This plan has been in operation over about 10 miles of river for about five years, and the increase in abundance of fish is scarcely credible; another 10 miles has lately been added, and will, I have no doubt, be attended by a similar result. This, however, is a very partial protection even in this individual river; and in many others, from the number of small landholders on the banks of the river, it woutd be found'impracticable. The only chance of retaining what we have no occasion whatever to throw away-the bteed of salmon in our English.rivers-a reformed fishery code, a Sal mon Reform Bil, with n extension of the franchise to aU the young 1should be very happy to correspond with any committee formed for the purpose of obtaining such a Bill, or to give information to any commission appointed for inquiry on the subject. I am. Sir. vour obedient servant. WVTT.T.TAIM AVYR'rn Hon. Secretay to the River Dee Fishery Asociation. Chester, May 4.
" DOD'S PARIIMENTARY COMPrXION.`-At the time of the meeting of the new House of Commnons Dodcs Partlamcndary Companion comes very appropriately. This work has acquired a reputation for a great essentialaccuraav, but the author has in the present edition adopted several improvements, which will render his Parliamentary guide more acceptable than ever. Every incident of interest connected with the composition of the new Parliamsent is described As asummary of the various changes which have taken place it may he stated that iSO persons wvho had no seat in the last House have been returned to the new one. Twelve members were returned between the 3d of February and the 20th of Slarch, who have regained their seats, so that the names of 201 new members appear in the present edition. A record is given of the votes of members upon various questions in the last Parliament. One great feature of the work is its perfect impartiality. To secure this the description of the political opinions of the members is founded for the most part upon the speeches of the members themselves. The numbers polled by the candidates all over the kingdom are taken from the official declarations, so that it is easy to ascertain the exact extent to which the constituencies exercised their privileges. There are other csoful improvementg, and, altogether, so much care has been exe;ised that the present publioation is to a certain extent h. n*W one, pres*ving, however, all the advantages of former diitiong. Some improvements are also intro. duced lntcr the deseription of the peerage, so that Dod'sPar. tiametryComipanioss comprises all the informafion which can reasonably be desired in regard to " both our Housci." It may be safely and usefilly consulted upon all ocawsions wvheTe iWgforatiQz~ i desired rspeQig the nwr Par. 1isuwut.
