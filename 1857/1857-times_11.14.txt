POLtCE. M3sA oN-RoUsM-John Grace Loveridge, clerk to Mr. W. Oldhamt wine merchant, of London-street, who had been remanced upon the charge of having feloniously stolen the sum of I31. 3 2d. belongtng to his employer, was brought before the LosD MAYOR for further examination. The prisoner, who said he should roserve his defence, was fully committed for trial to the Central Criminl Court. A sepaate charge was then prefered gAP t the prisoner of having feloniously forged and uttered a check for 921 63. 2d with intent so defraud his employer, Mr. The prosecutor said the check produced, for 921. 6s. 24., dated te 6th inst., with the signture " W. Oldham" in my writing, I delivered it to the prisoner on the day men. tioned, and it was payable at the Commercill Bank. He asked me for 31. for petty cash, and I gave hin the check to fill up for that amount. He had no authority to fill it up for 9214 6s. 24. The body of the check and the figures in the margin are In his handwriting. These are the words " Pay J. G. Loveridge's trade expenses' in the body of the check, but there were no such trade expenses to pay. There are two items in my petty cashbook ut down to the prisoner which have no reference to my Musiness. Cross-examined.-No salry was due to the prisoner. No sum of 971. was due to him for salary. He received his salary every week. W. Bradshaw.-The check produced for 921. 6s. 2d. was given to me by the prisoner to cash at the Commercial Bank. 1 was to get a 501.-note, a 201.-note, and the rest in gold and silver. I was to get the two notes cashed at the Bank of England. I also received a second 20t.-note from the prisoner to get changed. The three notesproduced, for 506., 21., and 201., with my writing on them, are those I changed. I changed them as soon as I received them at the Commercial Bank. I gave the whole ef the gold to the prisoner at the prosecutor's ofmoe. The Losn MAvoR.-Did you not think it rather strange that you should be instructed by the prisoner to have rpcourse to the double operation of first getting the notes from the Commercial Bank and then taking them to thie Bank of Englmad to exchange them for gold I Witness.-I had done the same thing before, my Lord. The LoRD MAvose.-Could you conceive any reason why you should not ask for gold at the Commercial Bank in the first instance, instead of getting notes there and then proceeding direct to the Bank of England and changing them for gold I Witness.-I always did as the prisoner told me. lIr,<E. S. Hall.-I am a clerk in the Commercial Bank. The prosecutor keeps an account with our house. On the 7th of November I paid the check produced, for 921. 6s. 2d., glvingin change for it a 601.. auda 201. note, and 221. 6s. 2d. Mr. Bailey produced the two notes referred to by the last witness, an said they were changed, with two other not*, for gold on the 7th inst. J. Crossley, constable No. 55L-I took the prisoner into custody on Tuesday morning last, and found 2sld. unon him. I afterwards searched his apartments, but could find no money. This case -waa now closed, and the prisoner, who again said he should reserve his defence, was fully committed fOr trial upon this second charge also. Mr. Hobler applied that his client might be admitted to bail. The LORD MAYOR peremptorily refused the application, GUiTDAT.TL.-George William Berrey, a traveller in the employ of Messrs. HIatton and Slee, of Newgate-street, fringe manufacturers, wras brought up on remand, befote Alderman Przim s, charged with embea3ling various 6su of money, amounting to about 501.., receIved by him for aud on account of his masters. He was fully committed for triaL. Charles Jenkins, a bald-headed, thick-set man, about 40 years of age, was placed at the bar before Sir John RugaRov% charged with the following outrage and daring highwa robbery. John O'Connor, a gerneral dealer, of 2, Finsbury.markel, said he was returning home late on Thursday night wiih his wife, and when in Beech-street about three doors froin the corner of Whitecross-street ihe left her for a few minutes, and when he returned he found her in allercation with the prisoner, and she then sid the prisoner had used the most disgusting language to her, and had also indecently assaulted her, upon which prosecutor said he would lock the prisoner up, and sent his wife accordingly for. a policeman. As soon as his wife had gone the prisoner said If that was what the prosecutor meant he must follow him, and he Immediately ran away. Prosecutorpursued, and saw him run up a court in Lower Whitecross-street. The prisoner concealed himself in a small recess in the court, and as the proeecutor was about to pass he struck him two violent blows on the side of the head and knocked him down. Prosecutor t-ied on getting up to collar the prisoner, and then found he had two other men to cope with in addition to the prisoner. They all three then closed in upon him and ho was knocked down four times, and he heard the prisoner exclaim to his companions, '- Why don't you get one of your fingers in his neck r and while he was down he recelved five or six kdiks upon different parts of his body, which was now black and blue from the bruises. The prisoner then tore open prosecutor's waistcoat and took the sllver chain from round his neck, and drev: the watch from his fob pooket. When the prosecutor found his watch gone and saw it in the prisoner's hand he made an attempt to get it again, and in so doing seized a white shawl-a muffler, which the prisoner wore round his neck; but in the struggle the prisoner shook him off, and he fell with the mufiler m both hands in the mud, and before he could rise again the prisoner struck him several times in the face and dragged the muffler from his gresp, and then disappeared with his accomplices. The prosecutor immediately gave information to Police-constable Turner, 162, who, with great judgment, effected the apprehension of the prisoner within 10 minutes. He identified the prisoner as soon as the officer brought him forward, and at the station, when the muffler produced was shown to him in a folded state, he said the marks of mud would be found upon it, and when it was opened there were fresh mud marks as he had described. He never saw the prisoner before. Mary Casey said she was living with the prosecutor as his wife, and corroborated his account of everything which took place in her presence. She identified the prisoner as the person who had grossly insultei her by his filthy lexguage and indecent conduct towards her. Police-constable Turner, 162 saId, upon receiving the Information from the prosecEtor he proceeded to a stable-yard inIUpper Whitecross-street, St. Luke's, and in a hayloft there found the prisoner. The description he received was 80 minute that he knew the prisoner must be the man, ana he therefore asked him how long he had been in the hay. loft, and he said, "About half an hour." He toid him the charge against him, and be said he knew nothing of it, and that he had never seen the prosecutor untU that moment. Witness found the white muffler produced upon the prisoner, who had it folded up in his hand as he was leaving the hayloft. Cross-examlned.-The prisoner dropped the muffler as soon as he got down from the loft, and the marks of mud might wossibly have got on it then. Sir JOHN MuSORoN- committed tho prisoner for trial, and directed the officer to look out for the other two men. Bow-sTwmT.-Mr. Bod}in attended before IfMr. JARDZE to apply for summonses against the keepers of five shops ini olywelU-streetand Wych-street, to show cause why certain indecent books, prints, &c., seized on their premises during the afternoon, should not be destroyed Inspeotor Mltchell of the F diviion, p roved the first seizure, on the premises, 20, Wych-street, kept by a person named Morris. He found two books and two prints. Inspector Mackenzie executed a warrant at 16, Holywell. street, kept by Thomas Blackall, who wid he was put in by a man named Dagdale, now in prison for selling obscene books. Inspector Leicoester p roved a seizure in the premises, 14, Holywell-street, kept by Mary Elliott, one of the persons against whom similar proceedings were instituted in September last. Mrn. Bodkin.-That was the woman who wrote a penitential letter, promising that she would never commit herself again. Inspcotor Leicester.-She has kept this shop for 30 years. Inspector Pether proved a similar seizure at 5, Holy well. street.

PoliceMconstable Millard sid he was on duty in the Hayniarket about 11 o'clock last night in plain elothes, ena ra *carrae driven by Pearce camne by he rece{ved a cut over the ear from the whip. Hle remonstrated with Pearce on his carelessness, telling him he might have cut somebody's eye out. The reply was that he (Pearce} would cut his _ hecd ob;~ and the other deEendant. Iatford, said the ame. While he was speaking to I*tford, Pearce gave him three cuts with his whip, and drove away. He followed the caridage until it took up at the flaymnrket, and then he made a oomplaint to a gentleman who handed a lady Into the carriage. The defendant Pearce as he drove off struck him with his whip over the bead and shoulders. He ran atter the cariage and caught hold of the near-side horse, upon wich Pearce begai lashing him furioudy over the head and shoulders with his whip. With somne trouble and with assstance Peroe wsM draged from the box and taken to the station. As they were on the way to the station Iatford swore that the police should not take his fellowservant and then caught hold of the collar of polioe-onsta. ble C 8d, intending to rescue Pearce. He laid hold of latford to take him into custody, and Latfsrd struck him severely about the head and body, threw him down, and while down he received several kicks, but he could not swear that Latford gave the kdcks to him. Another constable came to his asistanoe, andi atrord was secured and lodged in the tationhouea. Both the defendants were drunk.

Latford then began to assault him, upon which he sprang his rattle, and wheen asstance came tatford taken into custody. The defendants were both drurk Polioe.oonstable Cranbrook corroborated the foregoing evidenoe. Defendant Pearce denied that he struck the constable with his whip before he had laid hold of his horses, which being young and fidgetty he was afraid of an accident, and cortainly did usJe his wrhip to mnake the constable let go. Defendant latford admsitted he showred fight, but was colLared and secured before he could show wisat he ws able The defendants havins deelared they were sober, Inspector Lester, 0 Division, said the defendants when brought to the stationhouse were drunk. Ar. B0GEaAr3L-It is to me a matter of regret-I maysay sorrow, that two men in a respectable position, earing ample wages and enjoying every comfort, should, for the short pleasure of a little drink, be so regardless of their own Interest and of their duty to others as to expose themselve3 to certain los and probable ruin. For the safety of-the public, of yourselves, and your employer's property it is necessary that the regulations of the police as to the station of carriages should be imHpcitly obeyed, and if you, under the Influenoe of drink, choose to set authority at defiance, ou mnst, ss a lesson to yourselves and a warning to others, le taught that the law is stronger than you are. Even the establishment of that republic of which you, Latford, appear to eptertain such en4htened views would little better your condition; for, authority being subdued and anarchy prevailing, few carriages would remain, and certainly no coachmen or valets living in luxury. For your own sakes it is necessary that folly and violence such as you have been guilty of should be at once and firmly suppressed. You are each of you committed to prison for 14 days. Thomas King and William Harris were charged on suspcion of being concerned, with William Dalby, now in the ospital from injuries received while in conflict with a poice-onstable, in burglariously entering the house of Mr. white, watchmaker, 53, Bathbone-place. It appeared that Mr. White's shop was entered on the night of the 15th of October, and a number of clocks carried off. Policemoonstable Pratt, C 136, raw Dalby coming fromn the mews oppoeite with one of the clocks beneath his coat. HIe proceeded to tke Dalby into custody, but Dalby resisted desperately, and was so much injured that it vas necessary to take him to the hospital, vwhere he now lies. Remanded till Frlday. Wzsxs!i-E lixabeth Griffiths, a servant girl, was brought up for final examination, charged with stealing a shawl stated to be worth 100 guineas, and other costly articles of wearing apparel, the property of Mrs. Hudson, the wife of Mr. Hudson, of railway celebrity. From the evidence previously given it appeared that Mrs. Hudson is occupyirg apartments in the house of Mrs Butt, 4,Belgrave-roaa,to whom theprisonerhasbeen serTntduring the last two months. There were some boxes containing costly articles, from lndia and elsewhere, of ladies wearing apparel in Mrs. Hudson's suite of apartments, to which pri soner had access. Alittle girl, named Emily Stiwell, employed to take MrsButt's children toschool,vwas the Instrument used by theprisoner to convey the property from the house. She gave her two bundles to take to a Mrs. Grass, where she had formerly lodged, and the little girl taking some of the things home, her mother very properly acquainted Mrs. Butt of the eircumstance and prisoner was immediately given into custody. She at first only admitted to Fells, the oVicer who took her, that she had punrloined one bundle of things, but subsequently acknowledged to the second. She had robbed her mistress as well as Mrs. Hudson, and when she was searched two ends of towels with the owner's mark, which she had torn off, were found in her pocket. A difficulty arose in consequence of the absence of Ms. nudson. Mr. Smith, solicitor, of Denbigh-place, who attended on behalf of the prosecutrix, s%id that in consequence of the advanced age and infirmities of that lady she could not appear to prosecute, which he confrmed by the production of a medical certificate, and he therefore suggested that the prisoner should be dealt with for unlawful possesson of the pror The case wsaccordingy so haped, and Mrs Butt aving Identified her property, and the other witnesses having given the neceseary testimonv MWr.

TYRVnr, charged with wilfully breaking some eares of glass of the value of 7s., the property of the poor lr. R. B. Clark, the superintendent of labour at the St. Pancras Workhouse, said the defendants had formerly been inrmate of the workhouse. Last night they applied to be admitted, and being refused they broke the squares of glass and were given Into custody. Police-constable WiUiam Thompson, 274 S, said that last night he was on duty near the workhouse, when he saw the defendants pick up some stones and break a, window. 'When he took them into custody the prisoners did not deny the charge, buit said that, not being able to gain admittance to the casual ward, and being determined not to sto in the streets and cold all night, they had deliberately brokien the winidow for tbennurpose.f beinglocked-up,an thu obtain In defence the prisoners stated that having applied for relef and bng refused, they were determined to have a night's lodging somewhere.

Ho went to Dr. Wildbore, and, having been by him examined, that gentleman gave him a certificate that he was unable to do the work allotted to him in consequence of an accident, and recommended his instant admission, but when he applied at the gate he was peremptorily refused. Mr. TYiwtirrr was shown the certificate, which was as the defendant had stated, and also a discharge from the army, which set forth that he (Hazel) bad formerly been in the Rifle Brigade for seven years, that he had bought himself out for the purpose of joining the East India Company's service, where he served with great credit for 14 years, and weg then discharged Mr. Clark said, if HI adL pleased he could have gone to the workhouso earlier and have seen the relieving overseer with the doctor's certificate. Mr. T 'wnmr said it was all nonsense to talk in that manner, and refuse the man admittance because he was not back earlier. It was certainly very sharp indeed, the treatrnent the poor man had reived. It was really pitiful to see an old soldier-a man who, according to the papers he produced before him, had done his duty and served his country, first for seven years in the line and fot 14 years in the East India Company's servioe-bandied about fron pillar to post in the WAY that thig poor fellow had been.

PICTURE OP AN ILLuioTs BA.-TIn conclusion I will depict for you an Dllinols Bank. A frame-honse, a counter so high that you can barely lay your wrists on the sharp edges of it, and so narrow that but one man can approach at a time. The spde scoop hangs high up, like the laws of Nero, but unlike them covered with cobwebs. Your check is cancelled in deadly silence. You hear some fumbling behind a green screen. A package of shinpiasters as thick as a bull's horn and 25 cents. in silver is handed you for your inconsiderate oheck. The bundle is tightly laoed, the notes are inside, so that with the other inconveniences you can hardly count them. You open the bundle and sift the Tinkhams, Almondtrees, and Wisconslns, and you are peremptorily told, " No use in assorting, that is all youcan get." You say, "Please, then, return me my check." Answer, " Your check is already cancelled." This is the return made you by the best of them for gold ad. vanced on grain. Had the grain gone down you wonld have had it, but having gone up they return you such shinplasters for your advances in gold or stand suiL-.,SI. Louit -Reubimn
MR. HASSEY, M.P., UPON THE INDIAN MUTINIES. -0 (From the Han4cWr BExaminer of yesterday.) On Thursday night a crowded meeting of the eleotors and ron-electors of Salford vas held in the Town-hall, to hear en address from Mr. W. N. Massey, ALP. for the borough. The chair was occupied by the Mayor. Mr. MAcsx;r, on rising, waa very cordially received, and after a brief reference to the events of last session said, it was his good fortune to congratulate them at length upon the triumph of our arms inlndta. (Loud cheers.) The last accounts they had received satisfied them completely that rho two great objects which were to bo achieved by the British arms had been successfully aocomplished. The great resort of the mutineers-of the savages of India- had been reposseased by the British Government, and the hordo of miscreants had been driven forth; those who had escaped the sword and the bayonet had been driven into the wilds of the country, to be hunted by the British cavalry 'to death. (Cheers) 15ome people had said, in a murmur- ing spirit, but not in a manly spirit, that these wretches deservedmercy. If any punishment short of death was any punishment for them, then be said the laws of civilized countries, from the commencement of civilization to the present moment, had been barbarous and cruel laws. (" Hear," ard cheers.) They had ever recognized the propriety of lnflicting the last dread sentence of the law for offences of the highest description. Whensuch offences had been committed the severity of the law had been visitod upon the criminals; but had such offences in this or in any other civilized countryat all equalled the barbarities in India? If death was properlj iniicted by Christian men upon human beings it had been inflicted properly upon those peopie in India, who had earned four-fold the death that awaited them. (Loud cheers.) As mutinous soldiers, transgressing military laws and their duty to, their officers, they had deserved the stern sentence of military law. As rebels against their Sovereign, they had deserved to die the death of traitors. (" Hear, hear," and " Good lad, Massey.") As men who had perpetrated the vilest acts of robbery and murder, they deserved to die the death of the felon; and, as men who had outraged all the feelings of nature aDd humanity, they deserved to be held up as an exaLmple to future ages as a dreadful specimen of the vengeance a Christian nation could inflict. (Cheers.) This was what England had done. Was England blameable for having revenged the deaths of their innocent conutrymen and their unoffending and trasting countrywomen? ("No, no I") He could not advert further to the subject; it was too painful for them to hear, and too shocking for him to enter upon. Their feelings had been harrowed, and they had been distractedbythe intelligencewhicheverymail duringthe summer had brought them. ThisDelhi had fallen; Lucknow hadbeenrelievedjust intimebythegallantaDdgloriousHave. lock. (Loud cheering and waving of hats, followed by three cheers for Havelock.) Good fortune seemed from the first to have blessed the arms of that good soldier and good Christian, for at the same time that he put his trust in his good sword and in his professional knowledge, he never forgothis duty to his God. Many of the unthinking popalation of India had cast some reflections upon Havelock for his devout attention to his Chrlstian duty, bat it had been reserved to this brave Christian officer to triumph at last over the enemies of England, and to plant the banner of Christianity and civilization on the blood-sained and lustdefiled city of Lucknow. (Loud applause.) In the midst of the triumphs which had attended our arms they must not repress a pang at the fate which had befallen the great, galIant and evoted leaders upon whose courago, wisdom, and consistency the hopes of this country were pinned during the whole of that struggle. They could not express the nF they felt at thefate of General Neil (hear) and General c olson-those two great men, whose efforts had been devoted to the organization of the Indimaarmy under difficul. ties that would have cowed the best me Theyhad found themselves suddenly assailed by a mutiny whichhadescaped the observation and foresight of all the Indian authorities. They found themselves without adequate forces at their disposal, the great arsenal of Indiain the possession of the rebels, who also occupied the strongly fortified posts in the North-West Provinces. They were surrounded by Sepoy regiments who had borne a treacherous aliegiance to their Sovereign and their miltary oath, and in those circumstances they had to decide whether they should disarm the soldiers or trust them. If they disarmed them they deprived themselves possibly of some most valuable military ai - and if they left the arms in their hands they left them in t e hands of traitors. They had to aid them in their decisons on this momentous question only a small scattered Europoan force; and It seemed impossible to hold out until succour could arrive from England. They had to stand against 200,000 of those trained mutineers, men trained in the arms and discipline of European warfare. Well, then, surely if ever greatness was exhibited, if ever qualities which entitled men to the gratitude of their fellowmen, and qualfied them to rank as great men, as saviours of the human race-in the human sense-they were the qualities of promptitude, decision, and courage-qualites which were displayed by those great moe in this unparalleled emergency. (Cheers.) He belleved, when the history of this mutiny came to be written, the names of Neill and Nicholson would stand forward with that of Havelock as not only three of the greatest soldiers, but three of the wisest statesmen that were ever intrusted with authority In India or any other part of the world. The death of General Neill (he said) had deprived us of the happiness which we should have enjoyed-which the people of England, who, above all I?eople, were calculated to appreciate great merit, whether m military or civil life-his untimely death had deprived us of the gratification which we Should have felt in showering those honours and rewards upon his head which he so richly deserved. He did not knowr what might be the circumstances of General Nicholson, but General Neill had left a family to bewail their bereavement. And we should take care, this generous country should take care, to show its gratitude for the services of General Neiil by a liberal provision for the family he had left. (Cheers.) He would have had such honours as his Sovereign could bestow hWd it pleased Providence to spare him that bloody day. But it was not to be. He was not to be raised to the great council of hereditary legislators, in which we might have expected him to take his seat; but his name would be embalmed in the memories of his countrymen, and be assocated with the brightest triumphs of the British arms (cheers); associated with those words which had ever been dear to Englishmen-duty to his Sovereign and his country. Well, such were the draw. backs upon the glorious news which on the previous day the telegraph wafted from India. he great military demonstration made by this county had, as every man who knew the people of India expected it would, completely subdued this insurection. (Cheers.) The speaker referred somewhat in detail to the particulars which had been forwaded to England respecting the grand strale at Delhi and the happy relief of Lucknow, at a time when the otadel was undermined and Its heroic defenders were apps rently on the brlnk of destruction. He proceeded to observe that, the work of vengeance completed-the work of the soldier being ended, the work of the statesman must begin. (Cheers.) This work would be one of even greater difficulty, anxiety, and responsibility than that which devolved upon our military heroes. (Hear, hear.) A great number of theories had been propounded as to the cause of these frightful transactions He had, as he dared say most of thoee present had, examined all those theories, and had arrived at the conclusion that scarcely a soul could give any satisfactory solution of the matter; that by futare ivestigation, based upon a view of the whole of these transctions, wemust arrive atjust and accurate oinions as to the cause of these extraordinary events. (Cheers.) He had heard of people who almost despaired of arriving at anything like a plausible theory as to the origin of the mutiny, and who, looking at the vast, incongruous, unwieidly empire we have to reconstruct, and dwelling on the fact of a whole nation being up in arms against us, had been disposed to run from the portentous difficulty-to say that England had better give up India to the Indians, and desist altogether from any attempt to reestablish our authority. He would say, far be it from Englishmen to entertain any such pasilanimous counsels. It was a political maxim of a great people of antiquity never to despair of thu supremacy of the commonwealth; and should we be less wise and patriotic than the Pagan Romans7 (Cheers.) Was our history so deficient in triumphs achieved over almost insuperable difficulties that we should hesitate for a moment inputting forth all our eneres to the accomplshment of the great task now before us? (Cheers.) We must reconquer India, and reestablish an ascendancy there. (Cheers.) It had been said that our misrule was the cause of our difficlty. (Hear, hear.) Partiall, perhaps, that might be true. He wavs not going to denylt, or to be so absurd as to stand there an say that everything done in the past, by the home Government, respecting India, was reconcileable with true policy, much less to say as much of the acts of the verument of India. (Cheers.) But faulty as that Govern. ment might have been, it was ten thousand times preferable to the native rule of the Eastern despots. He considered that the King of Delhi had only been put forward by the mutineers as a convenient handle for rebellion, and said that, though on first hearing that the life of this old villain was spared he felt a thrill of indignation, the conasi deration of his age and imbecility, and the fate of those who might have perpetuated the same ignoble race, Induced him to regard the clemency shown in his case as wise and worthy of the British Government. (Cheers.) There was an ead to the ancient dynaaty of India, and upon its ruins, he believed, would be securely founded the throne of our Christian Queen (loud cheers); and if the ascendancy of Britain was of the gretest importance to Euroe, vwas it nos oxinn zymr imprtnc toth pepeOCdafr fio tel MO mu rmociportAnDe to the people of India, for any regeneration that Asia could receive in religion mnust come from the British nation? (Hear, hear.) He had told them that he was not in a condition to say what were the causes of this great rebelion; and he believed that any man who pretended to say what the causes of these most extraordinary transactions in India were wonld impose on bis audience. The causes must be ascertained through a long and painful investigation. He vas going to make a proposition which would perhaps startle them; he believed that toleration of their faith, the superstition which they caUed religion, by the British Government had been in a main degree instrumental-(har)-had had the effect of retarding the aseendancy of the British name and preventing the salutary- growth of Christianity. (Hear.) But they isust not misunderstand him. Toleration was the great corner stone of the religious liberties of this conntry; but don't let them abuse theat precious word toleration. As he understood it, it mneant the complete liberty to all, freedom of -worshiip among Christians who worshipped upon the same fournda tion. It meant toleration of all sects and denaominations of Christians who believed In the one mnediation ; bttt o apI the word toleration to A people who worshipped miseralile and bloodstained idols, whose religion was founded on principles shocking to humanity and disgraeful to humaan nature-to say that toleration was to be extended to such supErstitonswas,In his opinion, a gross abuse of the term. ear. Hi beiefwas that Christianity and Bhuddism coud nt louishinthe same soil-where the one flourished theothr mst erih;and, therefore, although it had been the racice f te Goernentof India, from its first instiutin o te resntmoment, not only to tolerate, but he elivedto hersh,to show marks of public respect to thtmiserable, gross, and ridiculous superstition-so frfrom that consolidating the people of India. to our rule-so far from making them respect us, he behieved that it had been Interpreted as a mark of fear and of subserviency, and of a want of sincerity in those professions of faith in the undoubted trutth of the Chrstian ADeslation whxich we hakd inAstructed the missioarzies to =prech.(Elcar, hear.)

(Hisses, cbeera, and great oonfuson whichlasted some time.)

("H Hear," and hisses.) They knew as much as he knew upon that matter. They had been promised by the Minister of this country a measure of Reform, and he no doubt Lord Palmerston would keep. his word. (Hear, hear.) BUt what that memure might be he knew no more than they did. (Great confusion.)

.PASSPORTS. TO THM EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-However painful it may be to one who loves hia oountry as well as I do to find fault before stragers with any of its political customs, I must on this oocaion raisa my voioe with yours agabnst the stupid pasport system advocated by the Constitutionnel, and which has beea so ably eposed in your paper. I call it myself a shameful nulBsa - I live half the year in England and the other liat in France, and I am in consequence obliged to go frequently through the horrible ordeal of the passport formalities; and I assure you that the so-called easy process of obtaining the right of moving is every time a regular torture to me. Thm know as well as I do the annoyances one has to go tbrough, at the police-offioe. I only want to relate to you what hap. pened to me the last time I had to return to this coUntfv. I had been to see my father In one of the western depart. ments, and there staid till my passport became p6r&im (out of date). Wishing to avoid, if possible, the police vexations in Paris, I procured a passport in the plae (a seaport town), where everybody knew me and my family, and I went to. Paris. There I waited till the last day for getting a passport a 1'6tranger, persuaded I could easlly do it by showlng the new passport Ih,d already with me. Bet alas ! j'arait compm sans le commissaire. I was told at the Pr6fecture de Police that my passport a Vird#ieur was of no use at all, and that I could not have one 4 l'tranger without a certificate of the commissaire de police du quartier. Now, ithappened Iknew nobodyin the quartier whereIwas acidentally lodging, and could not prove my ldentity without the asest. ance of two t6moins,paten&. I was pressed for time, hatiung an appointment in London at 12 o'clock on the morrow. Fortunately, I remembered there was in the next street a shirtmaker who had once worked for me. I went to his shop at once, bought a couple of cravats, and begged of blm to accompany me tothe commissaire's. He brought with hIm. a hairdresser who had never seen me before, and both assured the comnisaire that I was the min I sad I was, and that I lived where I said I did (of which they had noproof), signed their names to it, andufour hours after I had the desired passport en rgle, at the cost of 10f. for the newpassport, 2f. for the one I had taken at home, 5L for the cab, six hours of my own time entirely lost, one hour of thetime of my poor temoins patentes, without reckoning the anxiety I felt from the fear of being detained one day more in Paris. This is what, the 'Consiautionnd2 calls simple and easy. But, after all, this is nothing. There is a secret feeling which they have like everybody else, but which they wiu not acknowledge boldly. I will. Well, Sir, speaking for myself-for I have no right to express other people's feel. Ings-all the time I travel in France I fancy I am a child, with the eye of a troublesome and scolding tutor constantly upon me; in England, on the contrary, I know I am aman, perfectly independent, and enjoying to the utmost the privileges attached to the dignity of a man. I have during the last 10 years crossed the channel many, many times, aud entered Eugland by Southampton, Newhaven, Folkestone, and Dover. I have never entered my name in any book on landing at any of these parts, and never through the units kingdom have I been asked for a passport. The day I can travel as a man in France I shall sign myself with rmore genuino pride thanI do this day, A FRENCEHXN.
rAiuarAu xNArYL REFoR.-It s imsipoible to, add anything to the forcible appel to the national judg. ment which was urged by the leading jonrnal (2he True,) at the beginning of the week " What have we been taldng about ever snce Parliament was prorogued ? for that is the best test of what we shall want to talk about when Parliament meets again. Has the question of Parliamentary reform been onoe alluded to in any public speech for the last three months ?' That is the true test. If there be anybody who armong his constituents or neighbouts or private friends has been talking about property alifications or the baUot let him speak, for he is offended by the proposal to postpone the discussion of these questions to a, future occasion. If there are none then none are offended. But is the cause at an end which has diverted the attention of the English people from home affrirs and held it enthralled by the terrible attractions of an unexampled crisis in a distant part of British territory s On the oontrary, we know that for many months at least it must continue to operate, becoming wider if not stronger as thediscussion of Indian politics supersedes the observation and criticism of eur present military effort. The question, then, arises, whether it is desirable or prudent that plans for remodelling the reprewentative system of such a country as this should be brought forward in the intervals of a more exciting occupation, to be taken up with indifference and examined with a yawn; to be grudged every hour which is conceded to their consideration - and, in all probability, to be ado ptedi or thrown aside with little justice to their merits, for the mere sak-e of getting them out of the way, that the deck may be clear for the action on which all real interest is concentrated? The completion of the great fabric of 1832 had certainly better be deferred than be hurried over in a slovenly manner, or undertaken only to be easily and ignominiosly obstructed. If we cannot assure ourselves of being animated bya genuine impulse our condition as citizens is really not so bad that we need force an inciination for a change of circumstances. Nevertheless, we believe Lord Palmerston will have to vindicats the position in which events have placed him, by offering to the House of Commons the measure which he Is pledged tointroduce. There are many things which are right and proper to be said by everyone, except by the person whom they tend to release from an obligation. So It is i4 the present instance. The argument for the further pOStponement of the long-promised reform is overwhelmingly strong, but the task of pressing It to its practical conclusion will better become the independent politicians of any or all parties than the Government to whom it will be represented to bring an acceptable relief from all kinds of imaginarr perplexities and adngems Lord Palmerston will do wisely not to subject himself to suspicion or misrepresentation CZ this score. He will probably avow himself willing to per. form the part which has been assigned to him inu te programme of 1858; but it wvll not follow that he should resist a distinct expression of the desire of Parliament that, for reasons of public convenience and propriety, the execution of his promise should be suspended. Such a seaSonable exercise of the dispensing power appears to us not more than mnay be expected from the patriotism and good sense of the House of Commons.-lfanchester Guardian. A Punn Pop LiFE.-The crew of the Anj Maigaretta, of Leith, arrived at Hartlepool in a small boat on Wednesday morning, in a most exhausted condition, having lost their vessel on the previous evening under the followlng circumastances :-The muter reported that the vessel left Leith for Bordeaux with a cargo of coal and wine on the 6Uh inst. All went on well until Tuesday evening, when the cabinboy went below for some article, and found to his surprise that the cabin floor was covered with water, and some articles were floating aboutt He immediately gave the. alarm, and the pumps were set to work, the crew aboarin with a hearty good will to get the water under. The vessei at that time was about eight miles off Hartlepool, the light_house bearing N.W., and her head standing to the laud. The wind was fresh, and a stiff breeze was blowingi from the S.E. The crew made the most strenuous exertions to overcome the water, but their efforts werteunavailng. The night turned out very dark, and a light was hung out for assistance, but nono came. Finding that the leak was gaining upon them, and there was no chance of making Hartlepool, asthe tide was on the ebb, thecrew took to the only beat on board, a small one. They were unable to bring away any of their clothing, and only the logbook was saved On getting about 300 yards from the vessel sho gave a heavy lurch and fell over on the port side. With a strong tide and the darkness against them they made their way to Hartlepool, wearied by their six hours' rowing, rendered all the more arduous from the smallness of the boatb which there was great danger of ,pulling under theheavyseas The poorcabinboy was kept oailing the boat during the whole of the six hours, the sea coming into the beat continually. The crew were urempitly attended to by the agent of the ShipwreckedaMariners Society and sent home.-JanchetWem Gmuardian. Thr'ROVXNXTS mN FETTRnt-LAiN-The block of houses adjacent to Clifford's-inn, at the Fleet-attrt end of Fetter-lane, is to be removed during the course of next week. The effect of the removal of these houes will be to throw open to view from Fleet-street the new Recordoffice, and to afford an esy approach to the Judges' Chambers and the rumerous offices connected with them. It will also tend very much to facilitate the traffic along that hitherto most inconvenient thorolughfare.
ZiO iT-MIA BKET and CI Y Y LLLGENog. Friday ]gvening. The coudition of the various markets to-day has shown X considerable resumption of steadines, slthbough there has been no tendency to great con fidence or a rapid revivaL With the return of gold Mrom Scotlad which may sneedily be expected to commence, and the delivery of the large amounts amnounced from Australia, there can scarcely fad, ho0wever, to be a decided improvement, and an 5snpresslon is entertained that the Bank Charter Act, which bad not been practically overstepped up to last evening, may still, as in 1847, be kept free from actual infringement. Consols for money, 'WhIch left off last evening at 89k, were first quoted :39j to J, and there appeared to be no particular pressure of stock upon the market, but various :uctuations soon occurred, and at one time the price touched 89. Prom this they went again to S9s, ancd the final operations were at 89i to i qfor money, and 89a to i for the 7th of December. For a short time in the early part of the day loans on Stock were in demand at 10 per cent., but subsequently the rate ranged between 8 and 10. Bank Stock left off at 209i to 212 ; Reduced, 88 to iJ;, New Three per Cents., 88k to i; India Stock 210 to 213; and India Bonds, S0. to 40s. discount. Exchequer-bills experienced a considerable recovery, partly from an anticipation that a large funding may be proposed on the assembling of Parliament at'the beginning of next month. The arrival of the North Star with New York dates to the 31st of Oqtober was telegraphed in the afternoon, but not before the close of busineEs. The statements were that the money-market was gradually recovering, that no new failures had been reported, and that yinslow, Lanier, and Co., a large banking firm connected with the West, were to resume on the 1st of November, the day after the departure of the packet. At the Bank of England to-day the applications for discount, aithoughfar beyond the average amount even of the busiest times, were altogether moderate as compared with those of the two preceding days. In the open market the best bills were negotiable at lOj per cent. in the morning, and at a later hour transactions might posibly have been effected at the Bank minimum. The drain of gold to Scotland has ceased, but it Is believed about 100,000 sovereigns were despatched t .-day to Ireland. Business in foreign stocks has been confined to a vew tr1 actions for money, and the market shows increased weakness, especially in Mexican and -Russlan. Turkish opened at an advance, but aftervards receded, and closed the same as yesterday. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98i and 99i; Grenada New Active, 18; Mexican, 18 and :17k; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Centa., 74; Russian Four-and-a-Ealf per Cents., 94 and 95; Spanish, 39j and 40; ditto, New Deferred, 25i; urkish Six per Cents., 87A, B, and j ; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 96k, #, and j; Belgian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 93; Dutch Two-and.a-Half per Cents., 63i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 96i. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates were generally the same as last post, and on the whole a better feeling prevailed. In the corn-market this morning there were scrcely any transctions, but prices were nominally 2s. to 3s. lower. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a further fall of id. to Id. per lb. The final quotations of the French Three per 42:ent&. on the Paris Bourse this evening were o6f. 35c. for money, and 66f. 50c. for the end of -the month, showing another decline of an eighth. 4On the Vienna Exchange the prcssure continues to increase. The suspension has occurred of the respectable 1irm of Draper, Pietroni, and Co. Their busines was connected chieflywith Italy and Russia, and their liabilities are estimated at about 300,0001. Of this sum, however, a considerable portion-perhaps half-consits of letters of credit granted to house3 of high standing, who will doubtless at once with4draw them. Annexed is the circular Issued:- "' 81, London-wall, Nov. 13. "Our connexion with the Trausatlantic Steam Naviga tion Company of Genoa having very much embarrassed ths fimancil position of our general business, and that com. pany seeking at this time to press us to an unfair settlement, the effect of which might prove injurious to our creditor i generally, we have (however painful at this moment) determined on suspending our payments, feeliag assured that by- this step and the forbearance of those parties who may be interested In the reahzation of our assets, we shall (althoughvwe may cause temporary inconvenience to oar coriespondents) be enabled to discharge all our obliga. "1 We hbve availed ourselves of the assistance of Ieasrs -J. E Coleman and Co., and have requested them to place the statament of our affairs before you with as little delay as possible. " We are, younrs faithfully, "DRAPER, PIETRONI, AND Co." The suspension was likewise announced of Messrs. Bowman, Grinnell, and Co., of Liverpool, engaged in the New York trade. It is stated that it will be (nly temporary, and that It has arisen from a Eudden lock-up of a considerable sum in the Borough Bank, where they kept their account, the impossibility of selling any description of produce, and dissp;ointment in money remittances from the United %3tates. The liabilities are not large, and are under2 tood to be wholly upon bills of exchange drawn In New York. Mr. Grinnell, one of the partners, lately sailed for that city to hasten home funds, and an assurance is expressed that when the acceptances are returned there with protest they will be promptly provided for. Messrs. R. Balnbridge and Co., in the American trade, have also stopped, but their liabilities on this side are thought not to exceed 30,000t. or 40,0001. ;ubjoined is their circular:- "§14, Size-lane, Novr. 12. "Sir,-I. Is our painful duty to inform you that, in con. sequence o' the suspension of Messrs. Dennistoun and Co., -whose bills weohave taken to a large amount, and of tho inability of our house in New York to make remittances at -ahe present time, we are undor the necessity of suspending busnmoss. W We beg further to Inferm you that our books have been placed in the hands of Mr. Jay, the accountant, who will immediately commence his investigation. He will be prepared with the result on Wednesday, the 18th inst., when -the opinion of a meeting of the creditors wil be taken upon ihe best eourE to be adopted for the realization of our asset In the Unitd States and the payment of our engagemnents. " We are, &c, "R. BATINBRIDGE A-?D Co." The suspension of Munro, Grant, and Co., timber merchants, at Swansea, and of Steegman and Co., mtnufacturers, at Nottingham, is mentioned in letters from those places. A rumour was strongly circulated to-day from Glasgow that an attempt is in progress to resuscitate I he Western Bank of Scotland, that a million has leen subscribed for the purpose, and that it will Iprobably reopen on Monday. Many persons doubt the statement from the fact that a million seems an inadequate sum for the demands that would have to be encountered. A similar arrangement is also alleged to be contemplated with regard to the City of Glasgow Bank. The following from Messrs. Fitch and Skeet, whose stoppage was mentioned yesterday, explains an ambiguity in the wording of their circular:- "23, Rood-lane, Nov. 13. "Slr,-In reference to our ciroular issued yesterday, we beg to ay Me=ssr. Sanderson, Sandeman, and Co. discounted our bill and placed the proceeds to our credit, of whioh in a flw days after we took a small moiety, and did not make further appliation until the day of their suspension. " Our surplus, as shown at the meeting of creditors, was 17,000W over and above all labUitism Your obediently, " FITCH AND SKEET." 2he quot&tli of the rate of oxohange from Bombay by the present mail is apparently less favourable to the extent of about a half per cent. The figures presented in the monthly return of the Bank of France to-day seem to have created heaviness on the Bourse, but are not very much worse than had been anticipated. The bullion, which in the previous account showed a decrease of 896,0001., Las experienced a further reduction of 1,440,0001., and the sum now held in 7,580,0001. This, however, is 310,0001. in excesm of the total at the Bank of England according to the return published this evening. At the same time there has been a decrease of 968,0001. in the note liabilities. The discounts present a decline of 807,0001., but in the deposits there is apparently an increase of nearly 2,500,0001. The Government balance has fallen off 602,0001. In the advances on Rentes there has been no alteration, buat those on railway shares have been augmented 167,0001. The premiums paid for purchases on gold, which last month amounted to 10,1201., have been on this occasion 15,0001. The bar silver brought by La Plata has been sold to-day at 61id. per oz., showing a decline 'of id. from the price realized for the previous arrivaL, In the produce-markets during the week business has been almost suspended, and prices are again generally lower. The raising of the Bank rate of interest to 10 per cent. on Monday, together with the numerous announcements of failures, tended to increase the feeling of uneasiness noticed in the last weekly report, but to-day there appeared to be less disposition to force sales. The business in sugar has baen upon a very limited scale, at ls. to 2s. decline. Consumers are now quite bare of stock, and this morning there were symptoms of a revival in the demand. Further supplies have arrived from the TJnited States. In coffee, coloury plantation Ceylon has receded 2s. to 3s., but the market now presents a firmer appearance. Native is almost neglected. Scarcely any business has taken place in tea. A public sale of about 700 packages, "without reserve," attracted some attention, and the trade purchased at fair prices. Ultimately there was a rather better feeling in the market, and several parcels that were offering have been withdrawn. Common congou is moreinquired after. Cocoa has experienced a decline of about 2s. to 3s. A Government contract for 100 tons is declared for the 17th inst. In rice the few transactions reported have been at slightly lower priaM; and the market, although 3s. 6d. per cwt. bel6v the late highest point, is'still inactive. Saltpetre has been purchased only to a very moderate extent at about 2s. tp 3s. under previous quotations. Fine Bengal last went at 45s. per cwt. A considerable portion of the stock appears to be in strbng hands. Nearly all descriptions of spice have suffered aw further depreciation where holders have evinced any desire to realize. Cassia lignea is offered at a fal of nearly 203. per cwt. in consequence of arrivals from the United States. A special meeting of the Mexican and South American Company was held yesterday, in consequence of the position in which the company is placed by the state of the money-market. and the ditbiculty of realizing their assets in time to meet their ocourring liabilities. As the whole amount of the shar6s is paid up, and there was no power to make a call on the shareholders, it was unanimouiy' resolved to place the company under the operation of the Winding-up Act for the protection of the shareholders, and with the view of making an immediate call. The Calcutta and China mails left Marseilles this morning at 10, and may therefore be expected tomorrow afternoon. Intelligence has been received of the arrival of the European and American Company'a steamer Golden Fleece at Point de Galle, Ceylon, on the 8th of October, with 901 men and 33 offieers of the 34th and 42d Regiments. She left Spithead on the 8th of August, and has therefore made a fine passage. At the Court of Bankrluptey to-day Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque gave judgment on a long pending inveetigation into a proof against the estate of J. Windle Cole, a bankrupt, by Messrs. Laing and Campbell, for6,8741. Theproof was upheld, The decision removes from Messrs. Laing and Camnpbell any Imputation of having wronged, or intended to wrong, other creditor of the state. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 11th of November gives the following results when compared with the previous week:- Public Deposits ... £5,314,659 ... Increas 2442,715 Other Deposits ... 12,935,344 ... Increase 1,024,S74 Rest ... ... ... 3,364,356 ... Increase 58,777 On the other side of the account :- Government Securitles £9,444,828 ... Decreae £675,276 Oher Securities ... 26,11,3453 ... Inerease 3,485,202 Nober unemployed ... 957,710 ... Decrease 1.197,605 The amount of notes in circulation is 20,183,3551., being a decrease of 83,3901.; and the stock of bullion in both departments is 7,170,5081., showing a decrease of 1,327,2721. when compared with the preceding return. The extreme premure which has prevailed in the money-market is indicated by the unprecedented increase of 3,485,2021. in the private securities, while the extent to which the amounts thus drawn out have found their way back to the Bank is shown by the increase of 442,7151. and 1,024,6741. in the ptublic and private deposits respectively. Sales of stock appear to have beenmade to the extent of f,5,27GI., and the reserve of notes has been reduced by 1,197,0051. The present reserve is 219,0301. less than the lowest point to whlich it fell in the panic of 1847, and the stock of bullion is now 1,142,1831. les than at that period.
RAILWAY AND MINING SRABRS. Friay Evenng. The railway-market opened buoyantly, and, although rather flatter towards the close, left off at a general advance of from lOs. to 25s. Caledonian and South-Eastern showed the greatest improvement, the last price3 being respectively about 41. and 31. higher than yesterday. T'he large sales on banking or other accounts durinz the last few days bave been met by more than corresponding investments on the part of the public. A further recovery was ebtablished of abont 21. ia Grand Trunk, and of 11. in Great Western of Canada. East Indian, Ceylon, and Geelong and Melbourne also advanced. Foreign descriptions show little alteration. Eastern and Southern of France and Dutch-Rhenish slightly improved, while a fractional dedine took place in Northern of France and Lombardo-Venetian. Arnerican securities were quiet; Illinois Central shares were quoted $1 higher. Mines were flat, with little inquiry. Joint-stock banks also show increassd heaviness, and a reduction occurred in Australasia and Bank of Egypt. Miscellaneous securities were rather actively dealt in; Australian Agricultural and the discount companies advanced, and Electric Telegraph left off at a nominal decline of 11.

The gross receipts for tbe bh-year endirg the 30th of June last amounted to 57,278l.,and the exbenses=to 32,2671., or 561-3d per cent., leaving 25,01. net revenue. The receipts for the corresponding period of 1356 amounted to 53,3081., and the expenses to 29,o16l., or 55o. per cent., leaving 23,7921. The sum of 1,2501. has been set aside to meet any losses that might arise from bad debts. After payment of interest on debentures, preference shares, and outstanding debts, and other charges, a balance remains of 9,0181., out of which the committee recommend the payment of a dividend on the 31st of December next at the rate of 5 per cent. per anum on the ordinary shares, leaving a balance of 449l. The engineer reports that the railways and canals are in a good state of repair. The share and loan account shows that the company have power to raioe 825.000L on shares, and 27O,000l. on loans, together 1,100,00M, of whiohi 778,3001. has been raised on shares, and 207,500l. on loan, leaving 114.1991. to be raised.

A meeting has been held at Worcester of deoutations from the Worcester and Hereford Company, the Worcester Town Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and landowners from Ledbhry, Eereford, and Malvern, at vwhich the raUway company announced that they required 25,0001. to enable them to proreed with the works, anid after some discussion the deputation undertook to raise the required amount in shares. The company intend to apply next session for an | extension of time, and it was stated that Mr. Brassey had undertaken to execate the works on terms below the engineer's estimate, and to take shares to the amount of onefourth of the cost of construction. CORK AND YOUGIIAL. It appears that eminent contractors have offered to find 120,000l. of the capital required to complete the main line from Cork to Youghal, and the mranch to Queenstown, provided the landowners and other parties locally interested subscribe 80,0001. towards the undertaking. A committoe has been appointed to confer with the landowners and others with a view to raise the rennii ^A ^

" Thoy have been in hopes that Uhe choek given to tra ns actions of a speoulative charnoter, the transfer of eapital from other countries, the influx of bullion, aud She feelfing' which a knowledge of these circumstances might have heex expected to produce, w;ould have removed the prevailing' distrust. "They were encouraged in this expectation by the spea ceation of a similar state of feeling in the month of April last. "These hopes have, however, been disappointed, sad Her MajestWs Government have come to the conclusion thaV" the time has strived when they ought to attempt by' some extraordinary and temporary measure to zestore confidence to the mercantile and manufacturing cotrmunnity. " For this purpose they recommend to the directors ot tho Bank of England, in the present emergency, to. enlauo the amount of their discounts and advances upon approved secwity but that, in order to retain this operatioa within. reasonable limits, a high rate of interest should be charged. In present circurnstances they would suggest that the rAte of interest should not be less than 8 per cent. "If this course should lead to any infringement of the existing law, Her Mjestfy's Government will be ared to propose to Parliament, on its meeting, a Bi1F of "They will rely upon the discretion of the directors to reduce as soon as possible the amount of their notes, if any extraordinary issues should take place within the limit prescribed by law. "lHer Majesty's Government are of opinion that any extra profit derived from this measure should be carried t6 the accoant of the public, bat the precise modo of doing acs must be left to fature arrangements, "H er Majesty's Government re not insensible to thes. evil of any departure from the law which has placed the i currency of this country apon a sound basis; but they feel' confident that, in She present clrcnmstances the measurewhich they hagve proposed may be safely adopted; and that2. at the same time, the main provisions of that law and the - vital principle of preserving the convertibility of the bank. note may be firmly maintained.

NARROW EsoAFi FRO)i S}FFOOAnoz..-In Stai- ford on Monday morning two of the servants of Mr. Henry Smith, of Tinwell-road,were disoovred in a sate of suffocation from the fames of a small stove in their bedroom. Tho facts of the cm appear to be as foows -.The wall, of tho servants! bedroom has lately been undergoing repair, and. in order to dry the new plasltor, 2smal cabin stove, fed with common pit-coal, had been placed in the room during the daytime and removed at nigh; strict orders being als. given to the servants on going to bed not to shut the door close. On Sunday night thm ashenrworan, having ocm^slon to sleep in the honse, retired to )ed with the servant, and on finding tho fire was very werly all buwnt out, sbe took away the 'pipe of the stovo, which had been placed out at the open winadow, and left the shovo in the room, thinking so small a portion of fire touid do ao harm; nor did she consider it necessary to adhere to the instructions of the mistress to leave op,en the dooz, (n fidirg ia the morning that they did not rise at thi usual time, nor answer to a call, Mr Smith opened the door, and was grt alarmed at seeinz thern botb, to all appearance, dying from suffocation.

LOfDOAVp, SAURDAY, NVOVEMBBR 14,1857. It was an extreme thing to say that next to a ,aefeat a victory was the most melancholy event in the world; yet, as we turn a victory over, and roll it round and round in mind, we become aware that, like most things in nature, it has its light and dark side. A marriage and a funeral have some features and produce some impressions in common: they both call up the irrevocable past; both are partings; both are ends of one state of things and beginnings of another; both are mementos, spgnals, and warning notes of time; both remind us of chasms, past and to come, in the wocial circle; both impart regrets; both produce solemnity; and both, in their own way, lift up the veil of the future, and direct the look to that dim horizon beyond which no eye can plerce. We will do the English public the justice to say that of the millions who have read the news of the victories of Delhi and Lucknow there is not one but has paused in the rush of congratulation and triumph to pass a grave and sad reflection upon the fates of NiCHrOLSOz and NEmL-the first just allowed a gEmpse of the result, one short moment of a soldier's triumph, before he was carried off; the second killed on the field. Men like to see their own work when it is done, and we know they like to see it; we know that this is their chief and proudest reward, in comparison with which honours annd decorations, stars, crosses, and ribands, are tinsel; and therefore there is a touch of natural pity when those who have done or contributed largely to a great end die before t4ey see it. While we live to exult in the work, are they gone who did it ? This is the reflection of nature. Tbere is not a single sentiment which altaches to Nmswo dying on board the Victory which does not attach to NicnoLsoci and NEiLL under the walls of Delhi and Lucknow. These were brave men, cast in the true British type; diligent in their calling; faithful to their high employer, the English nation; devoted excellent servants; men of business; men of thought; men of will; high-principled, upright rmen; true representatives of British honour, intelligence, modesty, and- simplicity; able to command, but willing to obey; content to work their way quietly and regularly in a remote field, and with the sterling rewards of such service, with the satisfaction of work done and the well-earned approbation of commanders, friends, and comrades; men who felt the motive of glory far less than that of duty; who only valued distinction as the echo of self-approval, the token of past honourable labour both of body and mind, and who fostered beneath the cover of a professional code and standard the sacred fire whichr makes the patriot and the hero. Such were the men who, with a storming party one-fourth of the nuniber of the besieged, took Delhi, relieved Lucknow, and fell. The fatal ball struck each while heading the unequal and desperate assault. W1xHOrsoN was the " iron officer of the Punjab" -a specimen of that combination of the man of budines and the man of war, the civilian a-nd the soldier, which was more common in the was of two centuries ago-in our own civil wars, for example, when our Generals, rnd good ones, too, came straight out of civil departmernts, and only applied the clear heads and strong nerves of able administrators to the business of war as the emergency required. The field of India has in some degree revived this type, and raised up a clams of men who are civiians or soldiers as they are wanted-the CrrVE and the WAnRnmr HASTiNGS of a former day, and the L.kwnncrs and the NroHoISoNS of the present. The active and energetic administrator of the Punjab, the clear-headed civilian, rescuing the threatened siege-train on its road, fighting his way at the head of his troops up to the walls of Delhi, storniing the city, and falling in the victorious amault, is quite the revival of an ancient picture, and brings back the statesmensoldiers, the comrades of the STRAF"opDs and CROiWrnx of two centuries ago. N"EILL was a soldier of the stern school; a rigid disciplinarian, but at the same time a self-sacrificing one; strict with his troops, but also unspaTing to himself, and ready to share in all the toil, the difficulties, and the privations of the humblest common soldier. The middle classes of this country may well be proud of such men as these, born and bred in their ranks,-proud of such representatives, such reflections of their own best and moost sterling characteristics-proud of men who were noble without high birth, without the pride of connexionz, without a breath of fashion, and without a single drop of Norman blood in their veins. These men, and those like them, wherever they are, in whatever class they are, in whatever department they are, are the true aristocracy of nature and the true nobility of the earth. The real aristocracy of a country-that which raises a country-that which strengthens a country-and that which dignifies a country-that which spreads her power, creates her moral influence, and makes her respected and submitted to, bends the heart of millions, and bows down the pride of nations to her-the instrument of obedience, the fountain of supremacy, the true throne, crown, and sceptre of a nation,-this aristocracy is not an aristocracy of blood, not an aristocracy of fashion, not an aristocracy of talent only; it is an axistocracy of character. That is the true heraldry of man. It is the character which was portrayed above-that of solid simplicity and quiet strength, -a powerful, commanding character, controlled by modesty, tempered by thought and reflection, and subduing its native fire till the proper moment comes ;-it is this character, uited with intellect, 'which has won and which keeps India. And this is the character to which our middle claases should aspire. The repository of the Roman or Imperial type of character Is not the aristocracy specially of this country, but its middle class. Well may this class, then, be proud of these exemplars of it, and of those, like them, who have from time to time isued from the ranks of middle life in England to found, or preserve, or consolidate our Indian empire. The Indian empire is the triumph of the middle clas of England; they won it, and they have kept it. CLv was a man of the middle Class. WAnnMN HASTrGS was of a faMily reduced to that rank; almost all our great Indian statesmen and soldiers have isued from this class. The first English ruler of India was bred in a factory. Men of countinghouses, ledgers, and desks,-men who scrutinized account-books, and blotted their fingers over inkstands,-founded that mighty empire. Well may the middle ciasses of England be proud of their great creation, and proud of their great intruments and representatives in the work. It ax the business-like talent, the energy, the will, the sobriety, the justice of this class which has conquered India. it is that combination of moral and intellectual characteristics which is the type of excellence with our middle classes, and a type attained and fulfilled by many of them in a certain degree, and by not a few in a very high degree, which has been the instrument of conquest and preservation in the East. Well may the middle class of England be proud of their work-proud of that power and justice combined which has kept India under our rule ! Well may they be jealous of thee slightest movement, and watchful of the slightest omen which threatens that mighty work. And well may they glory in those high representatives of themselves, who have been their agents in constructing or maintaining it,-be grateful for their services, stand up for their just rewards, and mourn their noble and patriotic deaths. Even in the midst of our triumphant acclamations, while joy is in all hearts, let us " toll the bell" for NICHOLSON and NEmL, and those who have taken Delhi and Lucknow for us, but have not survived to rejoice in the capture. Toll the bell for them. Toll for the brave-Plangimus fortes, periere fortes. May their example be powerful, but, in order that it may be, let us show our reverence for it, and perform our pious work of praise and mourning !
At a moment when the principles, practice, and proprieties of banking appear to occupy the attention of the country and its Government our readers will look with considerable Interest at the I story of a Bank which has gone through all the phases of good and bad fortune, and at length presents an account of the oircumstanoes attending its collapse. Particular examples are always more impressive things than general dissertations, and some instruction ought to be gained from the reports made on behalf of the Liverpool Borough Bank which we yesterday published. Expectation, indeed, in this respect will not be absolutely disappointed, though at the most critical point of the confession there is a remarkable void. The Bank in question was a Joint Stock Bank, and two large classes of persons are consequently interested alike in the liquidation of its affairs. Not only are there the creditors of the Bankpeople who have intrusted their money to its keeping; but there are its shareholders-people who have also inveted their property in the concern, and probably in many cases with as much innocent confidence as the depositors themselves. The system of Joint Stock Banking, in fact, has introduced what may be almost termed a new class of creditors-a body of persons who ocoupy, indeed, the position of debtors aq regards the ordinary customers of the Bank, but who have themselves lent their money to form the capital of the establishment. We have seen what complica. tions of misery could result from this double arrangement in the case of the Royal British Bank, where, although depositors could not recover their deposits, shareholders were plunged into ruin just as helplessly and as unexpectedly as the creditors of the coneern. The Directors of these Joint-Stock establishments lie under a twofold recponsibility. On the one hand they receive and are acoountable for the moneys of their customers in the ordinary way; but, on the other, instead of trading like private bankers with no capital or risk but their own, they are answerable for the application and security of a second decription of funds intrusted to their management in the form of share. A man who has scraped together 1001. and desires to invest it can go into a Joint Stock Bank either as a shareholder or a depositor. He may iraply pay his money over the counter and receive interest upon the deposit, or he may buy shares in the market and participate In all the profits of the establishment. It is quite true that in the latter case as he stands to win indefinitely, so also may he stand to lose; but it is also true that an things go the shareholder is in most instances just as much a creditor of the managing body, morally speaking, as the depositor himnelf. In theory the shareholders delegate their authority to the directors, and maybe considered, therefore, as acting in their own persons through officers appointed by their nomination and governing under their control; but in practice they constitute a class utterly unacquainted, for the most part, 'with the buiness, and liable in ase of miscarriage to the same distress as the ordinary creditor. The widows and orphans re duced suddenly to destitution are as lkely to figure on one side as the other. Now, in respect of these impending coxmplications, the accounts of the Liverpool Borough Bank exhibit a prudent and judicious course of policy, the proceedings having probably been materially facilitated by the Act of last session. In the came of tIhe Britih Bank shareholders and depositors cut each other's throats for the benefit of none but the lawyers. As no member of the former class could see his way to saving himself, by any kind of sacrfice or effort, from uttar ruin, there was naturally no disposition to make any effort or sacrifice at all; so that resources which should have proved the security of the depositors were virtually unavailable. Against this evil the Liverpool establihment has attempted to provide by timely and obligatory arrangements. The depositors are to be gratified by certain terms not ilDiberaDy devised, and the shareholders are to be protected by undertakings from the depositors which it is hoped may obviate ruinous proceedings. In aid of these transactions a new class of functionaries has been called into being. Four gentlemen of known independence and integrity have accepted the benevolent office of " mediators," and what with committees on one side and the other, and interceusora operating between them, it is conceived that things will, at any rate, not be made worse than they need be. Three-fourths of the shar eholders, we are told, and a large proportion of the depositors have already agreed to the terms arranged. So far so good, therefore; and we trust the unfortunate shareholders in the Iiverpool Borough Bank may escape the misfortunes by which this class has been visited in other concerns. But there is another part of the "accounts," which receives very little elucidation in the reports before us. We have the atatement of the directors to the meeting of shareholders ; we have the statement of the shareholders' committee, and we have the statement of the professional accountant 'Whose services were engaged ; but in none of these documents do we find aany explanation of the proceedings or system of business which brought the Bank into its present position. There is no disguise attempted in the simple matter of fact; the actual result is expresed, beyond a doubt, in terms admitting of no misconception. "ISince the last report to the "shareholders," says the directors' statement, '; it "became apparent to the directors that the "poition of the Bank in respect to lomes "incurred and capital locked up and "unavailable rendered it imposible to carry "on the Bank, except at the risk of being sud"denly stopped by a run that might at any time "ensue from the dislosure of these losses." Again-" With reference to the pecuniary posi"tion of the Bank, the directors have to state "that more than one-fourth of the capitai is "gone . . . . and that three-fourths of "the capital is so locked up as to be at present "unavailable for banking purposes." The shareholders' committee announce analogous conclusions .-" So far as the shortnes of the time "they have been able to devote to the inquiry "and their previous utter ignorance of the real "state of the accounts wil admit of their "arriving at any conclusion whatever, they ven"ture to express their opinion that of not only the "original capital of the Bank, but also of "the asets held by them, a considerable por"tion is so locked up in various kinds of "euities that much time, great forbearance, and "good management will be required to insure their "advantageous realization." But how came all these losses to be incurred, and all this capital to be locked up7 There was no need of a catastrophe to show that the capital of a Bank never ought to be so treated. Losses, of course, all establishments must be exposed to in the way of business, Dut the very rudiments of banking teach that its capital funds should not be placed out of reach. Hov, could a. Bank have been managed in which, according to the confesdon of the directors themselves, threefourths of the capital has been "rendered un" available for banidng purposes," ie, the iden. tical purposes for which it was subscribed? The accountants have compiled a statement of the Bank affairs, but it has been considered that the interests of the shareholders-in the present deprecited condition of all kinds of property-might be injured by its publication,-a very natural apprehension. The shareholders' committee allude to "the origin of the present difficulties," but have been too much occupied to make any researches on the point, and conceive that " the time had " not arrived for such an investigation." On this we will only now observe that we trust the period in question will arrive at some time or other. What is done will certinly not be undone by any proces of inquiry, but the example may be of some benefit to the country. Whatever is said for the utility of public executions may be said for the publicity of accounts like these. At present the best steps appear to have been taken for pioling as much as possible out of the fire, and it is but fair to state that the private accounts and transactions of the directors and managers have been pronounced by the accountants to be free from the discreditable features exhibited In other instances. The failure, however, of such a concern as this must carry its leson, and that lesson the public ought to improve.
The telegrams which we print to-day add little to the news previously received from India. The chief incident is the situation of Lucknow. The East India House has received from General OuTRx a message to the effect that, though the R'esidency of Lucknow had been relieved, yet cons;derable difficulties remained tobesumoountedo The sick and wounded, the women and children, numLeiaid more than 1,000, and it was impossible to carry them to Cawnpore without the protaction of a larger force. As the small English army of 2,000 men was unable, without reinforcements, to capture the town, it was thought better to strengthen the garrison, revictual it, and then to fall back on Cawnpore. We may therefore expect that General OuTiAm has thrown up works around the Residency sufficient for its defence, has laid in a quantity of provisions, left several hundreds of men, and then retired to the southward to wait for reinforcements. The position of the garrison wi'l then resemble that of more than one other which has held its own in the midst of a vast army of enemies. While we must regret that it should be necessary to leave these unhappy women and children once more in their dreay confnement, it is yet reassuring to be able to point out that the trial is but for a r.hort time, and that the danger is far from menacing. The besieged will, no doubt, have been supplied with guns and ammunition, their forces will have been largely increased, and the Residency well stocked with provisions. If even, then, the force of General OUTRA'r should retire the garrison would well be able to hold the place until it should again be able to make its way from Cawnpore. All the anxietiea which attended the blockade of the place as long as the building was weak and the defending force insufficient may now pass Away, and the garrison of Luclmnor may be considered in the same position as that of Agra and of one or two other places in the ct.untry. But the fact that Oude is still overrun by the enemy, that Rohilcund and Rajpootana are in the sane condition, that the Mahratta States are in disorder, that, indeed, the whole of Central India is still unquiet, shows how necessary waS the de-patch of large forces from England as soon as the real magnitude of the mutiny was known to us. We learn that the Caledonian and the Carthage had reached Ceylon, but up to the latest dates there had been no fresh arrival of troops. From the middle of October, however, it might be expected that troops would be pouring into the country almost daily, and we trust that with several months' notice, and with the whole resources of the country at command, the Government has made arrangements for sending the reinforcements as quickly as possible to the seat of war. The Naval Brigade, under Captain Pm, had reached Mirzapore, and, whether the heavy gun be useful or not, there can be no dloubt that the 400 blue-jackets will be able to render good service. The news from the country generally is extremely good. SCINDI had crushed the Gwalior Contingent by means of his own troops, and this force, amounting to about 15,000 men, may be considered to be disposed of for the present. At Mundree, near Azimghur, the rebels were attacked and defeated by a body of our Ghoorkas. They lost 200 men, and were driven out of Mundree. We are sorry to say that the 52d Bt-ngal Infantry have murdered Lieutenant M&cGRLEGOR. It will be remembered that this regiment niutinied and marched of, carrying with them Lieutenant MacGREGon, and that a short tirme afterwards they wrote a letter, coolly asking for six weeks' pay, and declaring that they would not kill the Englishman, but only take him to Delhi. However, they were attacked by the Madras troops, who defeated them, with the loss of 150 men. In revenge for this check they have barbarously slaughtered theirprisoner. We may trust that theywillbe exterminated to the last man. All accounts agree in saying that Scinde is undisturbed, that in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies tranquillity is still maintained, and that in the Niz,'s country everything goes on well. It is also to be noticed that all the news we have is of events which took place about the time of the fall of Delhi, and that we have yet to learn the effect produced by that event, by the capture of the KING and the execution of his relatives. From the whole intelligence we learn two important facts; firstly, the insurrection is circumscribed in area being confined to certain districts in Central India surounded by British provinces or the dominions of faithfulRajahs; secondly, that the mutineers, though numerous and swarming throughout the country, are stiU given up to division and dissension. Oude, as the latest annexced province, the principal seat of the rebeUlon, and the country where the Sepoys were chiefly recruited, may be expected to hold out longest; but even here it is evident that it only requires a very few thousand of the troops sent from England to scatter the bands which still hover round Lucknow. By the next mail we hope to hear that Generals HAVuLocx and OUMAXu have been able to hold their ground, and that reinforcements from the mother country are hastening up the Ganges to crush the mutiny in its last remaining stronghold.
A bargain-a most foolish and disadvantageous bargain, as it seems to us-has just been concluded by the British Government. It has been long evident that telegraphic communication with our Eastern poseons is necessary to the wellbeing of the empire, and many have been the criticisms on what seems the inexplicable delay in carrying out the great enterprise. At last, when the Indian mutiny Is nearly over, we learn that the telegraph is to be constructed, but on such terms as must cripple the development of the system not only for a generation to come, but absolutely for ever-in all perpetuity. The Treasury have come to an agreement with the Austrian authorities that if the latter will make a submarine line from Ragusa to Alexandria the British Government Will use that and no other, wiU send all its telegrams by Ragusa to Alexandriri, and will complete the telegraph from Suez to Burrachee or Bombay. The obligation is, as we have said, in perpetuity, and therefore when this Austrian line is completed the Government will be unable to encourage, or even to sanction, any other project which may be formed to facilitate or extend commnunication. Now, we have notldng at all to say against the Austrian line and the use of it by our Government. On the contrary, we are very glad to see that Austrian enterprise in the Mediterranean is equal to such a plan as that of joining Trieste with Egypt. Nor have we any predilection for either of the two roads of telegraphic communication which have been advocated by projectors. For the last three or four years a war has been going on between the partisans of the Euphrates Valley route and the Red Sea route. The former party wish to carry the line from Constantinople through Asia Minor, or from the coast of Syria into the interior, and in both cases to follow the course of the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf. The scheme has this advantage, that it would give the shortest line, and this drawback, that it would carry the wire through countries where as yet the authority of the PoaTm is limited, where the Kurds and Arabs are nearly independent, and where the line would consequently be unsafe unless a kdnd of blacknail were paid to the heads of a great number of tribes. The Red Sea route involves a vast quantity of submarine wire, the laying of which is difficult, while great expense is incurred by any breaking of the line. Still it has only nature and accidents to contend with. When once submerged in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, or the Indian Ocean it need fear nothing from the bigotry and barbarism of neighbouring races. The stations may be fixed at Perim, or Aden, or some point near Muscat, and the line worked by our own authorities. This seems to us a fair statement of the respeetive merits of the two plans, and, should either or both be carried out, they might legitimately receive support. But as yet neither party has effected anything. The Government has, however, adopted the Red Sea system, and is prepared to carry it out. If this were an isolated avt we should have nothing to say. Out of two plans the Government would have selected one, and the other must be given up or executed by other means. It is when we find the Treasury declaring that this line from Suez to India shall be only used as a pendant to a certain line from Ragusa to Alexandria that we are obliged to ttep in and denounce the bargain. Let Austria make her telegraph, and let us use it as long as we want it, but let not our freedom of action be limited. Undoubtedly, the projected Austrian line will be useful, and if it be constructed it may for some tiue be the principal means of communication between England and the East. But why should our Government promise to make it the only means ? Surely, the intercourse between the United Kingdom and Its greatest dependency ought not to be at the mercy of any foreign Power? We presume that by this line mesages to and fro will pass through Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, and Belgium before they reach their destination. Can we not conceive circumstances arising which may break a communication which thus depends on the goodwill of each of a number of dlistinct sovereignties t Surely, it would be only right to have more than one string to our bow. And not only from political reasons, but for the sake of economy, for the despatch of business, and to guard against accidents, it would be advisable to encourage the construction of several lines. The French have a wire to Africa which may be extended along the coast to Alexandria; the Turks are contemplating a line to Bagdad, and an En3glish company has a concession for a sea line from Constantinople to Egypt; one or more of these schemes may be carried out, and it is the height of folly for the British Government beforehand to debar itself by solemn treaty from the use of them. At the present crisis it is, no doubt, right to use any means which is likely to facilitate communication with India, but this great advantage is indeed dearly bought when it limits the expansion of intercourse for an indefinite time to come. It is to be hoped that our Government will find some mean3 of altering the terms of this most Improvident agreement. It is due to the political interests of the country, to the private interest of individuals, to the great communities which will be affected by any deficiency in the means of transmitting intelligence. We have not only ourselves to consider, but the inhabitants of all Europe and aU Eastern and Southern Asia, not to mention the great colonies of the Antipodes. The line from Suez to India will connect the whole European and American yem with regions which are every day entering more and more into close relations with civ;lisea man. At what rate the progrems for the future wil be made must depend on circumstances which we cannot foresee; but there is every reason to believe that a period of rapid development hals begun in the East, and that in a few years commerce and political interests will growr to a magnitude of which there is now hardly a conception. This country is, of course, the Power which is most deeply interested, and which must play the most important part, and it its a most grievous mistake that our Government should consent to weaken its authority and fetter its freedom of action by binding itself for ever to use but one line of communication, and that line an Austrian line, which may be interrupted by any change in the political relations of Central Europe.

FIxZ AT LimTHOuSE.-Yesterday morning, about 3 o'clock, a fire took place on the premi3s belongIng to Mr. J. Buchner, a hat mauufa ctnrer, No. 24, in the Causeway. Owing to the highly combustible nature of the stock In trade in the place the flames progressed with unusual rapidity. Fortunately, upon the arrival of the engines, an abundaut supply of the EAst London Company's water was flowing from the firemains of the district, and the firemen, under the direotion of Mr. Fogo, the foreman of the A district, and Mr. Connbrton, of the West of England, set their engines to work, but, In spite of their exertions, the flames continued their ravages, crosdng completely the carrbge.road, and attacking the pre mises of Mr. J.

The meeting twas numerously attended, and as ahowina the Importance of the assemblage tho fact may be saetel that it included gentlemen representing firms who employ about 30,000 workpeople in ordinary thnes. Mr. W. E. lForster, one of the vce-presidents of the Chamber, presided. Anmong the other gentlemen in attendance were Messrs. Edwrard Akroyd, bl.

Mr. Al;RoYD, M.P., submitted a series of resolutions embodying the views shadowed forth In his letter which had been previously read by the secretary (Mr. Darlington). The steps which Mr. Ackroyd proposed the Chamber should take was to appoint a deputation to wait upon the Government (in conjunction with deputations from other Chambere of Commerce) for the purpe of asklng the Government to grant a suqpension of the Bank A-t of 1844, as wAs done during the panic of 1847, in order thatthe note issuesmight be increased. A discussion ensued, in whioh about a dozen gentlemen took part. Varions opinions were expressed as to the cause of the present tate of thin It was arguod that the Bank of England, undr. the circumstances, had taken the only proper course with a view to stop the drain of gold from this country, and some of the speakers were of opinion that the cause which had produced this crisis was to be found in overtrading, speculation, and the scarcity and high price of the rarr materiaL Several gentlemen remaed that the great thing required at the present moment was something which would remove distrust and restore confieenoe; and, though all agreed that this was a very trying period, even in the case of the soundest conerns, and that it was highly desirable they should watch the course of events, yet the general feeling of the meeting w against the proposition of Mr. Akroyd.

The unprecedented stringency In monetary affairs, which hua reached its cUmax during the present week, has brought business in colonial produce to a perfect standstill, holders, although anxious to realize even at any srifice, having been unable to effect sales. In sugar nothing worthy of notice Is reported, and of molasss 300 puncheons Cuba of indirect Import were sold early in the week, chiefly at 13s. per cwt duty pald for clayed.

Thesuspenslon of theBank Act, which was only known late yesterday, produted an immedlate change; stocks were withdrawnv; and to.day a re. eavery of 4d. per lb. is auparent upon some of the previous low sales.

AMERICA. SOUTHAMPTON, Nov. 13. The United State.' steamer North Star, Captain Lefebre, arrived at Cowes this afternoon with advices from New York to the 31at ult., being two days later than thore previously to band. She brings 10 paengers for Southampton, 14 for Havre, and 14 for Bremen, and a small cargo, but has no specie. The following is extracted from the money article of the New York .Uerald of the 31st ult:- "The stock.market to-day wag an improving one from the opening. With more aciHvity In all the leading railroad stocks better prices ruled. At the first board Ohio Sixes, 1860, advanced i per cent.; Msour Sixes, 1i; Erie bonds, 1871, 2i; ditto, 1862,1; New York COntrl Rail. rood, 1; Erie, i; Reding, 1I.. Pennsylvania Co fell off I per cent.; Cleveland and Toledo, i; Michigan Southern, preferred, 2; Galena and Ohicago, L Illinoix Central Railroad opened at 82 and closed at 83 per cnt., with moderate sales. All the moat prominent Westorn Rilroad stocks appeared to be in demand, and were freely offered. Almost the entire movement in the market is confined to the brokers. Outsiders may be picking up some small odd lots for investment, but there is a stong 'bull move. merit, which is resistod by a few determined spirits, who are not satisfied that we are wet out of the wood In our financial troubles. The leading 'bulls come from tho old ' bear' party, but there ar a few of the old grizzlies left, who have an abiding faith in the dishonesty of managers of incorporated oompanies generally, and of rail. road companiees in particular. The earnings of our rairoad companies for the month of October thim year will be far behind those for the same month last. We understand that the New York Central receipts will show a decrese of more than $100,000. The Harlem receipt for the month will be about $90,000, nearly one-half of which will, we are informed, be net income. This road is now well managed. The mileage has been largely reduced, and a great saving In this way effocted. On the same amount of receipts the not earnings are nowx much larger than hereto. fore. The whole secret of this can be found in the fact that there is now a practical man at the head of the manage. ment, and he eemws to know how and whore to save aoney without injuring the efficiency of the road Fe wat active, scientific, and practical men as preddents of our railroad companles,and not fancy financiers Let afinnce committee of the directors attend to that, and let the predl. dent attend X the actual operating affairs of the line of route. At the second board the market was rather weak, and for some railroad stooks closed heavy. New York Central Railroad decline di per cent.; Reading 1; ErIe Railroad ad. vanced J per cent.; Cleveland and Toledo J. The movement in Erie this afternoon was to some extent, and the sales were principaDy for csh. The most irregular and uncertain stock on the market just now is Reading. It runs up and down 2 and 3 per cent. without the slightest difficulty, The onlT State stock sold this afternoon was Missouri Sixes, at 69 to 694 per cent. The prompt and decided course pur. sued by the Governor and Legislature of Missoarl In providing for the paymont of the January Interest on the pub. lie debt, independent of the different railroad companies, and for the prompt payment of interest when due, for all time, has had a favourable effect upon the market, and wil soon place Missouri State Sixes as high upon the list a3they ever were. " The banka of Now Orleans on the 19th were, It is be. lleved, in a stronger position, and were anticipating the re ceipt of $400,000 in coin by the Cahawba from Havannals, and $40,000 by the Phliladelphia. The Bank statement for the week discloses a oonsiderable decreas in every main Item, the precise changes being &A follows Decrease In short loans ... ... $1,038,803 Decreasein specie ... ... 2,179,155 Decrease in irculAtion ... . 1.332,025 Decroase in deposits ... ... .. 2,05,586 Decrease in exchange . . . 105,166 Decrease in amount due distant bank .. . 58905 Decrease in deposits proper ... ... . 1,999,681 " The officers of the Connecticut banks are to hold a con. vention at Hartford, next Monday, to take into considera. tion the proposed cutting loose from the Suffolk bank, and to see what they can do to help their oustomers. " The interest on the State debt of Pennyslvanla, due February ], 1858, wll, we understand, be paid in specie. InthelBank Suspension Law passed by the Pennysylvania Legislature, it is stipulated that the deposits by the State Treasurer, or to the credit of the commonwealth, in the several banks and other corporations, and all banknotes which are now or may hereafter bo in the Treasuy, during the period of suspension, shall, from time to time, on demand of the said Treasurer, be paid by the said banks, or other corporations, respectively, in specie, in such amounts as may be required by the Treasures to enable him to pay the interest accruing on the public loans of the commonwelth. " The dry goods trade the present week hsa exhibited rather more vitality than has been witnessed before since the panio set in. The first auction ale of importance sinoe the panic came off on Wednesday, the 28th inst. The sale comprlsed an assorted and valuable catalogue of French goods of late importations, chiefly by Messrs. Curtis and Co. The terms of the sale were four months for approved endorsed notes, payable In the city of New York, for ad sums over $100, or 5 per cent, discount for cash. All biUs under $100 to be settled in ash without discount. The catalogue comprised about 725 lots. The sale drew a good company, and the bidding was in may oaws quite spirited. Some lines of the cheaper qualities of siks, such as sell for $1 or less, were wanted, and wore quick of sale at steady prices. Common styles of goods, Inclnding cotton plaids, &o., suob as were dull before the panio set in, were heavy, and several lots were passed. Broche shawls and some lines of mouseline3 de laine were sold at fair prices. The sale, however, taken as a 'whole, was said to be about 10 or 15 per cent, below the prices obtained for similar goods sold by auotion earlier in the season, or before the pressure came on. One or two eales of considerable magnitude are to come off next week, one of which is to comprise a catalogue of French goods, imported by a leading house on six months' credit. A hexvy sale of cotton domestio sheetings and shirtings Is also to come off next week. The jobbing trade has been irregular this week, some days loolkng brighter and promis. ing, though late in the season, quite an improvement In business, and again becoming dull and unsatisfactory. With some exceptions, with regard to certain localities, collections were coming In rather better than whet might be expected. The disposition of the large auction houses to resume sales at a credit of four and six months was considered to be a token of returning confidence. The cards still appeared in front of wholesale dry goods jobbing houses offering to sell by retail at wholesale prices. These cards also were hung out by wholesle clothing houses, offering to sell at 'tremendous reductions in prioes,' Thiscourso of the wholesale houses has been very In. jurious to the city and adjacent country rot.?Al trade, who had lid in supphes before the panio set in. The export trade of American piece goods continued to bo llght. The domestic trade In American cotton goods was moderate, and prices without change of moment, 'while sales wero light. The auction sale next week will ho some test of the market prices. Woollen goods were heavy. The declne In wool has had a depressing influence both upon manufacturers and upon prioes. The depressed condition of the wholesale clothing trade has caused certain lines of woollens to be neglected and prices depressed. Fancy goods of nearly all descriptions have been lees active and the trade duLl. Should the present stock of Ameriean goods be much reduoed, and cotton decline much in prioe, we may expect to witness ere long more or less resumption of work by Eastern mills, many of which have been driven to work short time, or have suspended operations." The New York- Mornin gBxpress of the xame date says "Money for all practical purpoe continues without change. Some of the banks wil increase their discounts upon satlsfaotory paper-which means the paper of partlies of known wealth, and in no noed of accommodation. "The use of currency by the otybanks ba thus hr boee of disadvantage to the country banks, whose cIrcubtion is now locked up In bulk at the metropolitan, a-ld represented in the city banks by certificates, of which $5,000,000 in value are required for the settlement of balances. The country banks desire to buy back their bills, but are unable yet to do so from the fact that asserting has not been commenced by the metropolitan. The currency of the State steadily diminishes, and so far from an improvement the reverse is the case with the money market of the Interior. "The city Indebtedness In the hands of the country banks Is considerable, and the country indebteness to the city is very large. Forbearance is due between the city and country, and no friend of either will now cultivate anything but good feeling between the two. "We have been very sorry, therefore, to lear in some few cases of a disposition on the part of the country banks, holding city indebtednegs, to press the debts to a point showing neither forbearance or good feeling towards the city of New York, Our country institutions should remember that the city of Now York banks are receiving and paying out all their notes at par value, and that the city abounds in currency issued by itose Inetitu. tions. They no more meet their promise to pay than the persons whose paper they hold, and axe pressng to immediate payment. Any spirit which refuse accommoda. tion where security is ample Ia unworthy of the institu- tions, and of the persons who Indulge in it, and we hope will be geneally diaountenanoed. " Eustern money goes slowly, and the Suffolk Bank fnds difficulty in gtting New York Exchange to redeem the moderte sums sent home for redemption. "The large amount of Engliah certiicatee of depoest sdd by the lecrald to have been brought over In the Persa, has not ben heard of in Wall-street among bankers and exchange drersw There is perhats a smAl increa of argnal acceptanoes here by the seamer, but no millilon of dollars as tated. " We ar able to annunooe that Winslow, IsnIer and Co., will resume payment in full this morning. It should be added that during the rupendon the basiness ha3, in fact, been uninterrupted, and that they retain tho great mas of their correspondenos. The known wealth of the houe made It rewonable to suppose that resumption would take place at an early day. It Is now apparent that sun pedion at all waa not necewary,-aud was under the In. fluenos of 'panio' " Exchange Is very firm, and sterling has sold at 106, andhield Mgher by leading houses None but names of the highest chracter can be und." The Eapress of the 30th rays:- " The most disouraging ne w we have to day is from New Orlean The cotton factors ar in trouble, and money is no asier. The $300,000 in specie we sent them yesterday by the Black Warrior, wi be something to mend matters. Can is feeing the pinch. From Toronto we lean that Mesers Ross, Mitchell, and Co., importers, kave failed. Their liablities amount to about $1,250,000. And the worst of It Is that their failure wrll be likely to pull down many country houes. The reported failure of Mayor Hutchinson is incorrect." The Philadphia Press of the 30th says " The Coliecter of NewYork and others capable of givlng reliable information state that Itis their opinion the reoeipts at New York from Customs will run up in three or four weeks henoe to the rate of $100,000 a-day, and that the receipts at other ports will Increase in proportion. Iu this event, then, the will exist no necessity for the Govern. ment to segotiate a loan or to isue Treaury notes; the revenue from Customs will be ample for the economical administration of the government. Nor will thero exist any ground for refusing to carry on works for whic appro. priatlons have beon already made, if any such desg was ever contemplated by the Administration." The Baryord Times says the following Conneeticut banks are still paying specie - " Neow Haven County.-Meriden Bank, Marlden; Home Bank, West Meriden. " Lichfield County.-Norfolk Bank, at Norfolk ;Hurlbut Bank and West Winsted Bank, at Winchester. " Hartford County.-Connecticut River Badning Com. pauy of Hartford. "M iddlesex County.-Mliddletown and Central Bans Middletown; East Haddam and New England Banks, FAA Haddam; Saybrook Bank, Essex; Deep River Bank, Deep River. The bank at Clinton and the M{iddlesex County at Middletown are the only two in the county that do not pay. "New London County.-New London Bank, New Lon. don; Coloheser Bank, Colcheater." The Bartford Press says that from six manufacturing establishments In that city no less than 700 persons have been discharged, and more have been put on short time. In Boston, as in New York, wholesale dealers i;z ik and millinery goods have decided to limit credits to four months. The dry goods houses are reducing their prices. At Wheeling, Virginia, the Belmont, La Belle, and Missouri Iron Works have determined to sspend. At Browxnsvile, Pennsylvania, upward& of 40 men have been dlscharged from Snowden's foundry. Pringle, Cook, and Lunhart's establishment in the same town has suspended. The Phidelphia Ledger of the 30th Usays "The investigadon which ha been going on for a week or two past by the directors of the Bank of Pennsylvania into the affairs of that institution, we understand, has been brought so near a elose that an Invitation was yesterday extended to the preddents of the other banls In the city to examine the result. This was declined, on the ground that the city banks had appointed a commlttee of their number to represent them on the aubject, and to interfere in the matter until that committee had made Its report would be indelicate and improper. We understand generally, how. ever, that the exhibit ts not favourable. The immediate liabilities of the bank, In round numbers, independent of capital stock, we are informed, are about $2,000,000, to meet which there are assets appraised at $1,750,000. If this appraisement and amount of labilities are oorrect, the bank would seem to be unable to pay Its debts, leaving nothing for stockholders." The Bostom Traveller of the 29th says " There was quite a reaction in mining shares, and the few orders to purchase, inducedby the very low quotatlons now ruling, had an electrio effect upon the mnarkets. Wm. nesota advanced $10 per share; Rockland opened at 16k, but closed at 20. Pittsburg sold after the board at 168, an improvement of $3 per share over the auction price of yesterday.' The New York Life IAlustraed says " There is scarcely a publisher who has escaped from the lst of 'f ailed or suspended.' Wo may name without discredit the following :-Harper and Brothers, J. H Colton, and Co., E. Cowperthwalft and Co., John P. Jewett and Co., J. S. RMsifield, Philip J. Cozzens, Miler, Orton, and Co., Richard Manr, J. M. Emerson and Co., Miler and Curtis, Bangs, Brother, and Co., G. P. Putnam and Co., Sanford and Swords, H. W. Derby and Co., Fowlers and Wells, and others, who found It imposdble to meet their engagements during this unprecedented panic, which so completely deranged the currency throughout the whole country." The Secretary of the Navy was said to have made arrangements whereby the mechanics attached to the various navy yards will be kept fully employed throughout the winter. The United States' steam frigate Saranac, which recently sailed for the Pacific, encountered a severe gale, during which she sustained such damage to her machinery as to compel her to put into Norfolk for repairs. The Democratr of Newbury port had nominated the Hon. Caleb Cushing for their representative i the State Legislature, and he accepted the nomination. The city of Baltimore had been placed under martial law by the Governor of Maryland, In order to put a stop to the outrages committed by gangs of rowdies during the election. An immense meeting of the democracy of the city of New York was held on tne evening of the 29th, in and around Tanmany HOll, when resolutions were adopted ratifying the party nominations for county officers, endoraing the Kansm policy of Governor Walker, and recommending amendments to the banking system of the State. The steamahip Granada arrived at New York on the 29th ult., with Havanah advices to the 24th. She brought $156,358 in specie. It was thought that the Quaker City would take a large amount of specie for New York. The money crIsis in the city of Havannah had caused Government to Issue a decree ordering an examiation to be made as to the solvency and capital of all the newly formed joint-stock speculation concerns on the island. Sugar had declined in price, and trade generally Was dull. There were no freights for American vessels in port. The reports of the sugar crop were favourable. Colonel Blythe, the UJnited States' ConsulGeneral, had returned to his post. A large cargo of slaves had been landed in a starving condition. The steamship Star of the Wast, from Aspinwall, for New York, with the Californa malls and trea sure, had not reached Havannah at 6 o'clock on the morning of the 24th. By way of Havana,ah we have news from Sau Jose, Costa Rica, to t}:e 23d ult.-20 days later than previous accounts. General Canas had left the capital on a diploraatic mission to Nicaragua. It was evident that the relations subsisting between Costa Rica and 'i.'icaragua were anytbing but cordial, and it wSf, announced as very probable that the two old part:ies in the latter country would soon again be arrr -yed in arm against each other. The ste. rmer Tennessee had arrived at New Orleamn with news from the city of Mexico to the 18th, arid from Vera Cruz to the 21st ult., and, a quarter of a million in specie. A new Cabinet had been formed. The rebels in the south had been. roAtbed by Alvarez with great slaughter, Tie entire coast of Yucatan was reported to be in the hands of the revolutionists. A letter from Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, dated the 8th inat., says that- " The pressure i the AMerlca,n MnaMy-market has canued a decline in all kinds11 of produceo here.

From Buenos Ayres there is not much poUtical news. Recent intelligence from the Azul and Patagones repreeented things as perfectly quiet in the South, with rumours, however, of projected invasions on a largO scale, in which Cdcua was to be aided by t* ChilLan Indians. In oommerolai matters there was verylittle to notice The arrival, andtransactions inthedrygoods markets had been very moderate. For articles of daily consumption there was more activity, but the demand still exoeeded the supply. The saladeros were at a standstill, and doomed to remain so for the remainder of the eurrent year at least. The se"on promised to be very late. Dry hides arrived in great abundance from the interior rivers, and also heavy supplies of epidemia hides from the country districts, notwithstanding which the demand increased and prices oontinued to advance. The case was different with salted hides, ox and horse. Hardly anything was doing in wools, holders being irm and speculators chary-the difficulty being enhanoed by the oourse of the money-market. Our oorrespondent at Buenos AYres, in his letter of the 2nd of October, Says : "The Government here has presented a Bill to the Chambers, sanctioning the arrangement made with the Lon don bondholders. It will, no doubt, be sanctioned; and the es Interested owe a debt of grstudetoMr.Riestra, the Ministr of Fince, for the oourage and pseverance with which he has prosecuted that negotiation. ' News arrlved yesterday of another Indiln invasion to the north-west, but we are as Yet In the dark as to the rerl detils, albeit Pergasnino is within a days ride of the capitaL "This packet takes home a strong representation to Her Majesty's Government on the National Guard question." From Rlo our commercial advicoe are to the 14th ult. In the Import-market business had been exceedingly limited since the departure of thePetropolis steamer. There had been but little movement in the wine-market, and prices continued depreed. Of Mediterranean red wines, sales were reported of about 145 pipes Port Vendres at from 190$ to 240$; Malaga white had been placed at 220$ to 230$, and 240$, according to quality. Stocks in first hands consisted of 2,773 pipes red and 50 pIpes white. Recent ales of second quality Lisbon red wine at 230S had tended to depress the market stUIl more, and, although the stock of red Lisbon was not excessive, sales to any extent could not be effected unless at very reduced rates. This steamer having brought bat 70 firklns butter, and expected supplies belng small, an unfavourable impression was produced on prices, and rates hAd risen from 640$ to 680$ and 700i. In first hands 700 firldns. Quotations for flour were :-Baltimore, 18$ to 18$500; New Orleans, 19g to 19g500; Philadelphia, none; Richmond, second, 22$500 to 23$500; ditto, first, 24$ to 25$; Stock, 32,QOu barrels, of which 16,000are Richmond. In the coffee-market a fair business was done after the Medway sailed up to the end of the month, since which loss dispoition to operate had boen manifested, as the quality of the lots at market was not suffciently good to meet the views of buyers. Really good and fine coffees, both old ana new, continued to arrive very sparingly, which was the more strikng as at this period of the crop a far better selection is usually looked for. Supplies had in genera been moderate within the past foktnight. From the 1st to the 13th of October the sales had been 18,000 bags, and from the 15th to the 30th of September 155,000 bag, maklng together 173,000 bags, of which 96,000 were for the United States, 43,000 forthe Channel and North of Europe, 30,500 for the Mediterranean, 3,500 for the Cape of Good Hope. Round lots raled up to the 9th of October for the States from 5$200 to 5$450; Channel, 5$100 to 5S200; North of EuroPe, 5$400 to 5S600; Mediterranean, 5$2D0 to 5$40D. SInce then nothing had been done, and quotations were entirely nomina, in consequence of the unfavourable news received from Europe and the United States by the Teviot, which arrived on tho morning of that dAy. There was no alteration in the prices of Campos sugars. In hides nothing had been done beyond 500 at 480 reis; stock, 3,147. Freights were very dull, and home chartered vessels hung heavily on the market. Exchange on London 27id. to ad.; binls to some extent drawn at six months were passed at 27ld. and subsequently at 27d. At Bahia considerable activity had provaUed in the flour. market during the week preceding the deprture of the Teviot and stocks amounted to 7,500 barrels. There had been no fresh arrivals of jerked beef, and price ruled from 6$000 to 6$400 per azroba, according to quallity. Irish butter sold at 740 rels per pound. No supplies of Dutoh cheese In hand. Stocks of wine were considerable, and dealers only purchased to supply their immodiate wants, OX. pectlng aconsiderable decllne in price; quotations were almost nominal and flat. Of sugar no sales of importance bad been effected, with the exception of about 6,400 bags of brown Nazareths, which were purchased at 2$800 and 2$900 per arroba; of good browns in cases a few small lots changed hands st 3$200 per arroba; of whites no sales had trans. pired. All other descriptions being neglected, prices were nominally 3$800 to 4$ per arroba. There had consequently been a decline of about 60Ors. per arroba since the report by the last Soutbampton steamer. Sales of coffee had been effected at 8$400 per arroba for Maced6s,and 8$800 to 9$ per arrobs for Bahlas, being 400rs. to 600rs. above. quotations by the last steamer; there was little left in first hands, but the demand had been less brisk latterly. Supplies of coffee -were coming in regularly, but there was leon demand; stocks were small, conisting of about 1,000 bags;J last sales were at 4$900 per arroba. Small lots of ooooaui whichb had appeared In the market found a ready sale at 7$800to 8$ per arroba. Hides were selling at 330rs. to 340rs.. per lb. for dry slted, and 380ra to 390rs per lb. for. dry. I There was more inquiry for dry hides, and holders demanded,] 400rs per lb. No tapioca In the market, anud good qualities were mnch inquired after, and would fetch high priew. Quotations of freights were nominal. In exchan.7, tngsactions were effected at 27jd., 60 days, for cash; bill3weom still offerlng at 27'd. on easy terms of payment.

TRE ORIBI&. MANOEESTER, Nov. 13. What effect the virtua suipension of the Bank Charter Act may have on trade here it is too early yet to predicat&, but it haB calmed public feeling on commercial rmatters considerably to-day, and we have bad a more cheerful and hopeful feeling in the market, leading spinnens in. some instances to put up their prices a little. It has not gli*en confidence to buyers, how. ever, and both spinners and manufacturehs compelled to realize havo had to make further concesions. Where males have been effected they have been made at rates below those of kat week a good deaI, and shirtings maybe quoted Is. to Is. 3d. per piece below the rates prevailing a month ago. Even with these exceptional instances, business has been on an exceedingly small scale. The suspension of a house in the American trade here is mentioned, and the particulars will probably be before the public soon. BRISTOY, wav. Im. The intelligence that Government had authorized' the Bank of England to extend its issue of notes upon securities was communicated on Thursday. afternoon to the President of the Conmercialrooms by Tr. Josiua Saunders, manager of the Bristol braneh Bank of England. The information was at once posted on the reading stands, andc spread through the city with electric rapidity. The gloom which had been caused among eommercial classes by the disastrous advices of the morning was at once dispelled, and the general feeling waa that the right step had been taken at the right ime for preventing the ruinous consequences of a monetary panic. The intention of Lord Palmeratom ninmediately to convene Parliamelt to sanction the course which hehad adopted (announced i-a 1 Times of yesterday) has also been received with extreme satisfaction. The change in the aspect of commercial matters here within the last 24 hours is very gratifying. EDTNBTJRGHi TIhunsMDy Evmimo.. This morning the banks were again visited with heavy demands for gold, but the panic had already shown symptoms of considerable abatement- whex in the afternoon an announcement was iasued by the Lord Provost -to the effect that, at an interview between his Lordship and the managers and. directors of the various banks, they had agreed to. accept the notes of both the Western and eity of Glasgow Banks whenever offered in the ordinary course of business. This gratifying and ressuring intimation had of course the effect of restoring full value to the notes in circulation, and as arrangemente are said to be in progress to retire the- notes of the Western BanLk, and to resume payment by the City of Glasgow, there seems every remon for hoping that tha crisis, so far as regards the ourrencr of banknotes, is at an end.
THE BAAY FAILURES IX SCOTMLIDA (From the .orth BrUtkshDayl. Atail), The block-up in money is extending wider and wider. Theuspension of the City of Glasgow Bank aggravates- m- smensely the embarrassment and distrust arising from the stoppage of the Western, and shows In what lamentable results want of confidenoe, when once it breaks looe, may involve this community and the whole kingdom. The same cause which has compelled the City Bank so closs its doors may foroe a similar course upon any bank in Scotland or the world; and one of the first duties we bave to perform in alluding to this matter is to point out clearly for the Information of the public in what the suspension of tho City ofGlazgow Bank consists. It is not because the bauk was unable to conve:t its notes into gold that itclosed its doors.. Every pound note which the bank has in circuation could havc been exchanged at the counter for gold. The City of GIasgow Bank, indeed, is one-of the few bauks in this country whlch could converts its whole paper circn-. lation into gold on demand immediately from its chest, because it has grown np chiefly.under the Banking Act of 1845, which requires a deposit in gold equal to every note above the average issue of that year. It is not because th, bank did not afford in the liabiity or meansof its proprie-. tary an ample security to its creditors that itwa-dnven to, shut its doors, because ita shareholders are very numerous, in. ny of them very wealthy, and all of thema we liable to the last penny of their fortune for, the obligAtions. of the bank. Nor Is the suspension to be attributed to bad debts in the books of the bank, for. ths assuanoe of the direstors,-a body of highly honouabloe men,-has. been published that this is net the cause, and no looses. sustained by the bank have been named that could maake any impression on thelarge pr-id-up capital (1;0,O000t sterling) and the reserve of the bank, The City of Glag-- gow Bankin short, has suspended because there was a ran upon it fen payment of its deposits in gold-a demand which Is clearly impossible to any bank that pays an interest on its. deposits1 ana the inablUtyto implementwhichatamoment's notice does not in any degree affect pmr e6 theperfect aol. vency sad solidity of the bank. Iteeems to ns important to pointout these circumtnes, for, in ddition to themnisoonception which they may remove in oountr7,towns where there ar braches, they will show-to the adilrers of the presentbanLkIng law on the other. side of the border thAt. there isno seurity whatever in the issue of notes upon an equivalont basis of gold against -the most. srious cstas- trophe which can befal-a commercial corasunit. No. case oDnld illustrate-thie better than the City. of Glasgow Bank, because, as we have said, its notes, under the Act of 1845, are based almost wbholy c soverelgns. The-present is hivdly the time for -blame or.recrlminatlon as to-tiecauses of this Ldditicual catastrophe. An oppor-- tunit3 will come when.the whole history of, these banking difiznultes will !ive to be- opened up with unPa.ring honesty. The City of Glasgow lank has been forced temporaffly to suspend in consequence of the distrust by the fall, of the Western,, and the faiof the Weste migbt have bee vverted by thetimely cooperation. and assistance of the leading Scotchbanks. The whole community is disgusted at the pride, selfishness, isolatics, and utter want of head displayed by the directors of our monetary. institutions, and the callousness and. stupidtyith which- thiey sacriflee -the. bonour and Interestb of thia immense city deay after day to -a ml-iserable vani!t and egotzism. The present crisis will lease. an indelible lsson on te minds of the cizens of Glasgow. as to the m to be "posed in certan banks, but the c-noernof tbemoment is imply what isto be done to lift. aiffast out of this dead,ock.

FORBIGfN GENCE. -FRANCE. (FROM Our OWN CORRESPOXDX1T.) (A porion of the following appeared in our seoon edl C-o of -t-A- --I_ r&±ue, -CHURSDAY, NOV. 12, 6 P.M. M. Abbatucci, whose death I announced this morning, is the fourth (or rather fift Miiter of the Imperial Government who has paid the debt of nature, M. Di'cos, Minister of Marine, xL Bineau, of Public WVorks, M. Fortoul, of Public Instruction, all died at their posti; and Marhal St. Arnad was Minrster of War until the day he left for the Crimea. M. Abbatucci was in the 65th year of his age, and his robust constitution seemed to promise yet maDy years of life. An absces in the intestines, which attacked him hardly a nARnth ago, baffled all the reso s of the medi cal art. M. Abbaticci belonged to an old and repectable family of Corsica, several of whose mnembers were in the service of the Republic of Venice when Venice was yet an indepen- lent State. The Abbatucci family, it is said, otcoe possessed much influence in their native iand, so much as nearly to counterbalance that of the Paolis during the war of independence which Corsica waged against Ganoa. The father of the deceased Minister, however, served under the orders of that distinguished patriot. In 1790 he was made night of the Order of St. Louiic and Major-General, and took part against Paoli and the English in 1793. General A.bbatuccl, who died in 1812, left four sons, three of whom fell in battle. The youngest was he whose death is now notioed. He vas born in 1792, received his early education in the Lyode Napoleon, and studied law at Pisa He was named Procureur du Rol under the Restoration, and was subsequently appointed Councilor to the Court of Appeal at Bastia, in Corsica He became one of the Judges of the Court of Orleans after the Revolution of 1830, and not long after was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies for his native island. His origin and his family traditions attached him to the Bonaparte party, of which he was considered as one of the representatives In the Laegilative Afssembly. After the PRevolution of February he was promoted in the Court of Cassation to the post which he bad declined in 1840 in order to keep his seat in the Chamber. He retired in 1849, after nearly 33 years of judicial functions. He was named representatlve of the people to the Constituent Asembly, and was one of those who opposed with energy the motion in favour of the rights of labour, and advocated the nomination of the President of the Republic by direct suffrage. His devotedness to the Napoleon family gave him a high place among the partisans of Prince Louis Napoleon. He believed, and there is reason to think his belief was sincere, that in those days of anarchy and danger the fortunes of the country were intimately allied with that of Napoleon III., and it is hardly necesary to add that he devoted all his faculties to promote the interesbt of those with whom I believe he was connected by family ties. In recompense for these services the Emperor raised him to the important post of Minister of Justice, the duties of which he did not cease to perform until he was prostrated by the malady which has carried him off. x Abbatucci's career was, I believe, fair and honourable throughout, and I have never heard his name aasociated with the doings attributed, rightly or wrongly, to others who have been in high places. The Emperor, T have no doubt, sincerely regrets the lows of one of his most devoted servants and friends. The funeral obsequies will take place on Saturday, just a fortnight after those of General Cavaigna, and preparations are maldng at the official residence of the Minister of Justice for the ceremony, the expense of which will, it is said, be defrayed by the State. The Presidents Delangle and Troplong left Paris this morning for Compiegne. A decree in the Moniteur announces the oonvocation of the legislative Corps for the 28th inst. It is believed that this is more a matter of form, and from a desire to eomply with the letter of the Constitution, than anything else. The meeting for what, I presume, we may term "6the despateh of business" will take place in January, at which period the Senate will also be convoked. On the present occasion nothing more, it is probable, will be rone than taking the oaths and the verification of powers. The session will, therefore, be brief. We are told that it is owing to the scrupulous anxiety of the Emperor to respect even to its very letter the Constitution of 1.852 that the deputies are summoned to the Palais Bourbon, the Council of State not having got through its preparatory labours. The weather in Paris has undergone for the last two or three days a marked change. Only a few <days ago it was so warm that people began to return to their summer clothing, and some days were nearly equal in warmth to the month of June. The present temperature is more natural to the season, but the change has been unusually sudden. Frost hax vsited the capital and the country in the neigh. bourhood, while autumn still lingers in some of the southern departments. The air In Paris is keen, but it is healthy and bracing. The Moniteur de la Flotte has a long article headed "English Humility with respect to the Capture of Delhi," with a running comment on the speeeh of Lord Palmerston at the Mansion-house. Thie Mimiteur de sa Flotte is not, It says, among those who looked upon the generai fast and humiliation as an act of hypocrisy, for, though individuals may be hypocritical in their external devotions, a whole people never is so. It approves that solema manifestation, and admires the sentiment of contrition expressed simultaneously by milons. The Moniteur de la Flotte thinks that there was good cause for it, for " English policy in particular may utter more than one mexl cUlpc, and we need not go very far to discover faults which she herself feels, since she deems it her duty to humble herself before God under the terrible visitations which have afflicted her." The moment approaches, it believes, -when the 'world will be able to judge of the reality of that humility, and whether it has borne all its fruits. It examines Lord Palmerston's speech. It says:- " The Premier has attributed extreme importance to the taking of Delhi, and has all but declared that the Iudian insurrection has received its deathblow by it, To hear the noble lord one would suppose that the greateet difficulty Is actually overcome, and that, with the formidable army which England has just sent out to Ihdia (in all 85,000 Europeans), and which is to be maintained In that country, there is nothing more to fear. The Prime Minister of England is more capable than any one can be to judge cor. rectly of the state of affi%irs; and, until the contrary be shown, we are bound to believe that he Is not mitaken. Placed so as to have the most positive sad the most copious information, he must know exactly how matters are, and, under present circumstances, it is not probable that he desired to lead public opinion astray in stating what he' did not think." The Moniteur de la Flotte exprerses a hope that all wiU boe as Lord Palmerston says; the time for receiving ample details from India is near at hand, and the public wiiU then be able to judge how far the assurances of the Premier are borneout by facts. It then touches on the other part of Lord Palmerston's speech. It saysc- "The second point Is more delicate ; but here again we are bound to say that we approve what he said. We remember the clamnour that was raised among the English public against the pretended clemency of Lord Canning. With the frightful atrocities of the Sepoys before them, to speak of justice seemed a weakness, and all but treason. No word should be uttered but that of vengeance-of pitiless vengeance, and, perhaps, even of reprisaL We could under. stand the blind exasperatiou on the part of families wvho count so many victims in India, and anguish so poigasnt may well silence, at least for a moment, not only the feelings of humanity, but even all respect for oneself. But we less understood that fury-or rather we blamed It-lof the English press; and we agree with some of our confrares In France that the savage expresslon of such implacable determination did injury on the continent to the English cause. It cooled the sympathies which such misfortunes naturaly awaken, and theEndieh journals thatwent to such estremes have rendered no service to the interests of their country, to which they believed tLey were so faithfuL At a moment when the effervescence of passion has not yet sub. aided, though it Is less warm, the Premier has shown no little courage in speaking as he has done. It is true that on a recent occasion Lord Granville and theDukeof Cambridge gave an example and pointed out the route to be followed. Lord Granville, in particular, was bold enough to defend Lord Canning at a time when every one was indignant at the Indian Administration. It showed mun h courage on his part, but it ao evinced much justice. Lord Pslmeritos with his habitual prudene, did not tread this slppery peth nntll othens had passed before him. Hle saw that he ground was firm, and he marchd in thefootktp of.thoia t pre eeded hio, perhaps wlth some bautation, but not writhet lltce Now, the approval of Lord Cmi's 0o0dwt mesAS tMin htEe represson of the Sepqy JziaiinW at the victory modQration wMll be obeerved-a moderation which the insurgents certainly do not merit, but which be- I comes a oivih'zed and Christian people. England sets much value on that oharacter.which justifies her presence and her domlnation in India. But that situation imnposes on her obligatlons in the eyes of the World; and if her army passed certain limits in the act of repression, it would exclte against Itfeelings analogous to thoseroused by thebarbarous acts of the Sepoys, Even individuals are wrong in avenging themaelves by the frightful means employed by ferocious enemies whoare rather wild beasts than human beings: a Government would be muth more to blame, and the proclamation of Lord Canning, which hu been so much censured, is in reality worthy of prase No person should individually take justic into his own hbnds In India. Whatever his wrongs maybe he should intrust his case to the firmness and juEtice of his Government, who are strong enough to decdde with equity and calmness." Thus far the Moniteur de 1z Fotte approves. Now for the censure- " We fear that the triumph of England In India may iLcretae the pride of the men who are now at the head of affairs They have exhibited real humility under the hand of God, and under the pressure of events In which the finger of God is dlearly traced. But if that humlity is profound and deliberate, It ought to gard against the pride which victory engenders. English diplomacy is not habitually very complying in it relations with other Powers. It must not become more bitter and more haughty because the canse of England triumphs in India. It must not by an increase of exactions and Intolerable pride make Europe pay for the fears whlch have existed In Asia. No orower has thought of profiting by the embarrassments of England; and England, on Its part, mnust not profit by her triumph to press with a still heavier weight in international discus. sions. We mention this zeserve after success as a duty of pradence, and of good conduct on the part of the states. men who are at present at the head of theEnglish Cabinet, without, however, any very strong hope of our oounsels being listened to, reasonable and useful as they may be. But, (as al know, what English policy and English diplomacy are particularly reproached with is the excessive pride wbich does uot hesitate to hurt the feelings of others, and which too harshly reveas the selfishness (egoinme) with which It is animated. At the height of power which Great Britain has attained, It is a sc't of giddiness which affects those who govern her. But lw strong soever she may be, it is no good calulation to provoke just hatreds In spite of what Ttoe Tmem hai recently sid, Englad is not envied on account of her wealth and her prodigious prosperity. In France, above all, there are none of those envious feelings, because, after all, France is quite as power. rul and as glorious as Great Britn. But If England be not envied, she Is In general but little loved, and the mauner in which her aitesmen act towards other nations enters much In that unpleuant dispoeition which they sometimes aprielously excite. Lot us hope, then, that the day of fast and humilation will have Imparted a salutary leson, and that, afteX the victory which is preparing, they will know how to remain as truly humble as they promisea to be in a moment of sinoere contriton." It has been already announced that the Flronch Govemment sent cornnisioners to study the navigation of the Danube. The following ia an extract from the report recelved fron them : " The waters of the Danube were lower this season thn at any period during the last 40 years, and It was found that the bed of the river, which was never before examined with due attention, presented difficulties and dangers not previously known. The Austrian Company only who navigate the Danube have competent pilots, and even these feel it aecessary to use the lead constantly. By observing this precaution the pilots have learned to pass the dangerous points, and perceive, moreover, whenever a sandbank shifts its place which frequently produces serious consequences, but even with all their care these men frequently run aground. When foreign vessels acend the Danube they experience great difficulty in finding a pilot. An inexperienced per. son may steer a boat along the lower Danube when the waters are high, but when they are low it requires a practised pilot to navigate the river throughb banh of shiffting sand, where there is not even a buoy . to direct the steeormn. The captain is then forced to en8gage IOosi pilot. These men are sufficlently acquainted with that part of the river near which they llve; but it frequently happens that they have not for months made the passage through which they undertake to steer a ip, aud ihey commit serious mistakes in oonsequence of the shifUng of the saudbanks since their last expedition. When a boat is descAnding the Danube the ourrent ncreas the speed of the vessel, and it is neoeessary to takeo rt preoautions In sounding. It often happens that a boat, havmbg enterd one passge, finds it obetructed, and is forced to return to discover another passage. It is particularly when those pasages cross the rlver that the navigation becomes diffioult. The river generally becomee wider, and the depth of water isnot more than two f6st, and sometimes les. 'Under such ocrcumstances the slighte dedation of the helm may cause the destraction of the boat. Itis diffiault, as may well be Imagined, to Indicate precisely the position of the paasages. There are 17 of them between Galtz and Tourno.Severin. The first is opposite to the mouth of the river of XostendJ6, the second I5iles below Silistria, another 10 miles below Oltenitza, another, very difficult, n miles below Glurgevo, another at the same distance below Roustohuk, and asother a' sight miles below Sistova. At two miles below the latter town, if the waters are low, navigators should be cautious of a rock which Is placed precisely in the centre of the river. and is not indicated on any map. A bad passage is likewise found above the banks of Sistova, a second at two miles, and a third at eight miles above that town. There are two bad passages at two and eight miles below Nicopoll". There are lkewise two at nine miles above the same to"n4 Thence to Tourno-Severin there are but two, one before Czibra and the other at Ioun-Palauka. The depth of the river, except In these difficult passes, is from 15 to 18 feet. In order to render the navigation of the Danube safe it would be necessary to have experienced pilots stationed at several points along its course. If that measure should be considered too expensive, the gard houses which are established on the left bank of the river by the Wallachian Government for the defence of the frontier might serve to point out the dangerous passages. It would likewise be useful to place scales on several points of the river to indicate the depth of the water. Throughout the course of the Danube the river is in a state of nature, and everything is still to be done to render it navigable. The Iron Gates, which are the most serious obstacle to the navigation, consist of a succession of banks of rocks which extend across its course to a distanco of 12,000 feet. The most of these rooks are visible above the water, and some of then rise to thre feet above the ordinary level The oarrent runs between those rocks from five to sit mile3 an hour. Other banks of rooks are found at 20 miles from the Iron Gates, before reaching the Austrian town of Drenkova, which render the navigation imposslble when the waters are low." The report suggests the expedienoy of turning the course of the river by outting a canal through another valley, and thus avoiding these obstacles.

The present commercial and financial crisis appear by the last advices from St. Petersburg not yet to have extended its paralyzing iniluence to the Russian capital. There have been as yet no annouxacements of housee stopping payment or factories knocking off hands, still less of bankruptcy and panic. Discount was still 5 per cent.; exchange on foreign countries wa- falling, in consequence of the excellent harvests in the west and of the smaller demand for bills brought about by the cessation of exports, which the approach of winter has already almost brought to a stand-still. The number of vessels that have visited and left St. Petersbsrg this year has also not been so large as during last year; but it mut be borne in mind that the unusual lIerese of that year was due to the sudden reopening of the Ruian trade at the conclusion of the war. The aTrivals this year have, up to the date of the last advlce mounted to 2,252, asnd the departure. to 2 316 In a ry few da a the navlNption wras t4 be dlosei for ti gemone TS GJtW for has commenced issuing its ahares in return for the preliminary scrip hitherto in the hands of its shareholders; it was left optional to the latter to pay up the calls in full at once or not, and in eOnsequence4s 908 shares have been paid up in falu, and 6,911 in part. This eircumstance has led to some very sensible questions being asked as to what the company c%n want with this amount of capital paid up, and which bears interest, just at the momentwhen all its works are being suspended by the return of winter. As yet no satisfactory answer has been given. The Grand Steam Navigation and Commercial Company, too, is described as having Prospered as far as its operations have been extended at present. Its receipts in Augast last amounted to 109,000 roubles, which considerably exceeded itereceiptsin aDy former month. According to the present result of its transactions the company is making a net profit of 5i per cent. per annum; and as the amount of dividend would not seem to justify the high price the shares bear at present, it must be supposed either that the public entertain great expectations of the future working of the company, or that there is a plethora of capital just now in Russa. Prince Menschikoff has just been saved from the impending oblivion of all clases of Rusian soclety by an ImDerial rescript, which confers on him a reward for former meritorious services-not for his nmssion to Constantinople, nor for his defence of Sebastopol, but for his preceding services as GovernorGeneral of Finland. While inthe exercise of his functions there he gave the first impulseto the project of the Saima Canal ; the canal has since then been completed and opened for navigation; the Emperor has now, therefore, conferred on him the privilege of weng the uniform of the FRnland Engineers of Roads and Ways. That Prince Menschikoff should have been intrusted. with the defenoe of Sebastopol in the late war maybe looked upon as a providential punishment for his towering arrogance towards men who, though of lower rank than himself, were far" better informed than he on matters of trategy and fortification, and equally a punisament to the 7m peror Nicholas, who preferred the flatteries of Menschikoff to the less pleasng truths of better men. It happened, shortly before the Crimean war broke out, that when the Emperor was at Waraaw on a tour of Inspection, the various Generals in attendance on the Emperor conversed on the merits of various strong posts in the empire In the preenee of the Emperor, who entertained the delusion that be himself understood something of fortification. On this occasion General Dehn pointed out that Sebastopol was far from being the impregnable place it was supposed to be, inasmuch au it had one entire side, viz., the south aides unprotected. To please the Emperor, with whom Sebastopol was a favourite piece of fortification, Menschikoff averred that " such an idea was aU nonwense,that Sebstopol required no further protection, and that he would engage to hold it against any enemy." The two Generals soon got to such high and hard words that the Emperor ordered them to finish their -angling and wrangling somewhere else, and not in lIa presence. The operations of the Allies in choosing the south side for their point of attack subsequently showed the correctness of Dehn's judgment, and had they not been withheld from attalking Sebastopol lznmediately on their arrival before it by an over estimate of its powers of resistance and of their own deficiency In siege guns, it would have been taken at once, to Menswhikoff's l,asting disgrace. WVhen he returned to St. Petersburg, after being recalled at the conclusion of the first campaign, Menachikoff always threw blame on Prince Dolgorould, the Minister of War, for not having forwarded him ammunition enough. This was amply refuted by the official documents, showing the dates and quantities despatched, with the dates, &c., of arrival, and Menschikoff once so far lost his sense of deceny as to tell the MinLter before the Emperor that if he (the Mnister) had in. ceed sent off the powder, as he stated, he was not the man to invent it. The Russian journals are as unanimous as they are persevering In assuring the world not only of Russia's pacific policy, but of the Improbability of the peace of Europe being disturbed again for a long time. The Invaltids says:- " Apartfrom he auspicious meetings of crowned heads, there are three circumstances that at the present moment secure the peace of Europe, at any rate for some years to come. The pre-eminence among these must be accorded to the events in India, which have brought England into the position in which she is just now. We ee that even those political jonals which expross themselves with the greatest respect and delicacy with regard to the power of Great Britain admit the necessity of eAgland straining every nerve, If she Intends to be victorious in the conflict; tho conviction has] also gained ground in England that, in order to attUin this victory, every fresh conflict, every fresh complication on the contlnent,must be avoided, so as to prevent any division of her resources. It my therefore be assumed that Englandwll strive to remove all scruples and misunderstandilngs that might lead to collisions, even supposing that Lord Palmerston should long continue to occupy tho post of Premler. Bussia requires quiet to complete her rallways to fortify her harbours agains' the new projeotiles that have been invented by modern sdenoe, and to refcim her fleet and her army. Earope knows very well that che war lately brought to an end has not exhausted the resource5 of the Russan empire, and in this last oonflict a new conviction was acquiredEurope can look on Russia with confidenoo. When we loo&c at the financial position of Europe the tbird circumstance which serves as a pledge for lasting peace, reveals itself to us clearly and plainly. A glance at the exchanges of London, Paris, and Vienna will suffice to convince one that war is for the present an impossibility. France will find dfficulty enough, when she wants to raise > loan of a few hundred milions of fTanes, to keep her public debt account square: is she likely to borrow milluirds for war purposes? Numerous railways in Brance have suspended their works, and shaU new credits b, opened to enable her to cast bullets and manufacture powder? Quiet is indispensable to Europe; It is an essential for all and every one. Tacitly, but nateLtly to all the world, Europe has come to the agreement to avoid all collisions that migh possibly militate against the quiet so essential to her." In harmony with theses ex;tremely pacific professions, the lealn or asun of the Russian press treat the promiinent questions of diplomatic warfare with great mildness and reserve. The Northem Bee, for instance, while spealdng of the Danubian Principalities, employs language that leads the reader to conclude the Russian Government is no longer so bernt apon an union of Moldavia and Wallachia as it formerly was. Nov. IL The activity that has reigned through the naval departnents of the Russian empire, and also in the Bhipbuilding yards of the commercial marine, with a view to repairing the loss inflicted on its naval resources during the last war, has been very grea; indeed; and may, if not wholly, certainly for the greater part be attributed to the unthring energy of the Grand Duke Constantine. This ativity of the Grand Duke appears not to be confined to the mere spurring on of lazv officials or, the execution of praoticabusiness, but to the scientific improvement and development of the forces under his command. It was only very lately that, at ths request of a French naval officer who was com piling a polyglot nautical dictionary, and desired to collect the Russan sea-phrases, he selected two particularly well qualified Russiau officers to work out a fulfilment of the Frenchman's recueat. In te course of the summer two squadirons have been despatched,-viz., to the Pacific Oce and to the Black Sea, each of them consisting of six screw corvettes. The Pacific Ocean squadron conDsists of the Wojewoda, Navik, Bojarin, Plastin (marksman), Dschigit (hero), and Trelot (arrow), to which is attached the screw frigate Askold, whicb is to be at the special disposition of Admiral Count Putiatln. The object of this squadron is to protect and advance the interests of Russia in the Chinese and Japanese waters; aad before it sailed frorm Cronstadt was especially visited and inspected by the Grand Duke and Duche3s Constantine. Captain Kusmetzoff, under whose command this Pacific squadron has been placed, takes with him the most extensive and careful instructions with a view to advancing the knowledge of the geography and the navlgation of the coasts of the Pacific Ocean. TheBlack Sea squadron consists, as above-mentioned, of six screw corvettes-Ryss (lynx), Udan (sea snake), Subr (bison), Wehr (boar), Buiwol (buffalo), and Wolk (wolf), the first three of which, under the command of Captain Ligatscheff, arrived off Sebastopol on the 18th of September. The popula- tion of this town has in this year attained to 15,000 souls, a large portion of whom are old sailors, who have returned to the ruined object of their late courageous defence, after having had their woundi cured or haning spent a short timne of absence in the north of Rumia. The American company that has got the contrac for raising the vesels sunk In the harbour hs undertaken to tomplete its ope"ations in the cours of two yeam.; the emolaiM't lte Amnericans are to receive is to consist of one-half of the proceeds of the vessels raised. The Minister of the Interior haa lately issued a circular to the inhabitants of the whole empire for the purpose of lncitingthem tosubscriptions for theimpoverishedinhabitants of the Crimea and the southern provinces. In addition to Sebastopol, Eupatoria, Kertch, and Balalkava, there are no less than 100 villages laid waste, which looks very much as if the Tartar population had availed themselves of the presence of the allies to wreak their vengeance on the "Moscows," and although the Emperor, in addition to the gratification and bounty to the military, has already allotted 1,500,000 of roubles, and private charity ha also done much towards the alleviation of diress there, there is still nearly as much to be done. The commercial flotilla already engaged in the navigation of the Sea of Azoff Is stated to consist of 900 new vessels, of course necessarily vessels of amall draught. The flotilla of the Caspian Sea has lately received a reinforcement of three steamers, the Eirgls, Lesghin, and Tatarin. The report lately sent in by Lieutenant Lund, who, at the command of the Governor-G(eneral of Finland, had made a tour of inspection through that province for the purpose of aw&rtaining and reporting on what was doing in the ship-building yards on the coast of the Bay of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia, shows that there are now beiong built there a screw frigate of r0 guns and a screw corvette of 13 guns, both for the Imperial navy; 57 merchant vesels of an aggregate capacity of 38,700 tens, on which 3,000 shipwrights are employed, and there is further a large number of smaller vessels, from 50 to 100 tons, be3ng built on the bankss of the Saima lake and canal, and along the coasts of the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Finland, and the AlandIsles. The losses which the Russian marine has suffered in this year from natural causes seem also to have almost rivalled those entailed upon it in preceqing years by the state of war; or, as the language of our rnarine policies says, the losses arising from "God's will "and those from the "Emperor's enemies" seem to be nearly equal. There have been vessels launched at Arc4angel so leal-y that they could not live an hour on the sea; others from ths same latitudes that contrived only by inceBsnt labour at the pumps and frequent repairs of the engines to put into some Danish port on their passage to the Bay of Finland; and numbers have foundered, or, at least, have gone aground in the difficult navigation of the Sound and Belts. The greatest -losses of all, however, have been sustained in the late equinoctial gales, and in consequence of the thick fogs that visit the Bay of Finland and the Baltic at the approach of winter; the only itIgation to these losses is the circumstance that they ococrred late ln the autamn, when the navigation was nearly over for the year. In that fearful conflagration which I lately r6ported to you as having taken place among the ahipping in the river Wolchow, at the entrance to the Iake of I4doga, there were no less than 39 vessels burnt and 131 sunk, 91 floats of timber burnt and 225 injured. Had not a steamer and different parties of shipwrights been as prompt as they were in their assistance the loBS must have been much more fearful, as there were no less than 172 vessels and 245 floats of timber at that time in the Wolchow. The damage done as it was amounta to 300,000 silver roublea. The line-of-battle ship Lefort, whieh lately capsized in broad noonday in the Bay of Finland, when closely surrounded by numerou vessels of the fleet on their way from Rsevel to Csonstadt, has since been extamined by EnRglish. divers at the order of the RUBSsan Government. It will probably be still in the recollection of your readers that the vesl had, in addition to about 800 troops and cresr, full 400paxssengerson board, chiefly women and children, who, with quantities of bulky house furniture, occupied the whole 'tween decks. Out of consideration for these uwonted pasengers the portholes of the man-of-war had been left open, and when a sudden squall came on could not be closed in time; and so, when the wind took her the yessel heeled over, filled, and at once capsized. Such person. &i were on deck at the time were of course at once washed away, but the divers found no less than 1,100 corpses in the cabins 'tween decks, and in the hold of the ve4sel, al clinging to some portion of the timbers of the ship or to each other. Tbe horror of this fearful sight apdper to have been aggravated by the circumstance that the bodies ,Fere already tar gone in decomposition, aud, with few exceptions, the eyes of all the corpses w ere wide open and glaring. The effect of this dreadful spec- on the divers was such that one of them was tally unable for many days to recount the ghastly scenes he had witnessed down in that hive of putrefying corpses, and on his persistent refusal to repeat hs vist there was sent home. ITALY. (raOM ovn OWV coxRrsro-IDMT.) TURIN, Nov. 9. As the day fixed for the electons approaches the excitement increases, and the acitation and anxiety in some of the provincial districts are, as we learn, very great. In Turin people take the matter more 9uietly, but still the coming contest is almost the sole I pibject of conversation in the clubs and cafes, anda werever men assemble. It is well to be viglant, .n d to avoid the overcoonfidence which sometimes eads to a reverse, but in reality there seems very little doubt how- the elections will go, or that the Governmentwillobtainagoodworking majority. Itis expectedthatabout 6Odeputieswill bereplacedbynew men, but that this change will scarcely produce one in the strength of the respective parties in the Chamber. The clerical party is actively at work, but with little appearance of success. Some of its principal members, including Solaro della Margherita, are put forward as candidates for several places at once, in hopes that in one at least out of the number they may prove successful. It is said to be certain that Della Margherita will be beaten at San Quirico, which he represented in the last Chamber. The various means, direct and indirect, employed by the priests, the pastorals and letters sent to newspapers by high church dignitaries, do not seem to have much effect on the electoral body. The manceuvres practised will work only on the most ignorant. Generally speaking, the Piedmontese have too fresh in their memory the system under which they suffered knowingly to do anything that might tend to restore It. The more educated and reflecting part of the nation clearly se what the results would be of the ascendancy of the retrograde party; and if the other and leas intelligent class does not reason the matter so closely, still a wholesome instinct preserves it from being misled. Although their hopes of success must be slender, the priests display great activity and tenacity, but their zeal is apt sometimes to overrun their judgment. Thus it may be questioned whether the letter which the exiled Archbishop of Turin, Monsignore Fransoni, has just addressed to the ArnAnia will not have the comtrary effect to that which its writer has proposed.to himself. Even a good causemay be injured by an obnoxious advocate, and the name of Fransumi-s too closely associated with clericalop- pression, and with intolerant acts of no remote date, to be of much service to the party in whose behalf it is now put forward. The intemperate conduct of the Archbishop in 1850 is still fresh in the memory of the Piedmontesem It is well remem- bered by whose direction it was that Count Santa Rosa, when on his death bed in August of that year, was denied, as a framer of the Siccardi law, the last consolations and eacraments of the Church, unless he confessed that he had sinned in lending his hands to that measure, and renounced the principles up to which he had conscientiously acted. Although a man of strong religious feelings, he refused to recant, and died unshriven, to the grief of his family and scandal of the ountry. It was in consequence of the great exasperation roused by this glaring example of tyranny that the Servltes were expelled from Turin and Fransoni sent to a fortress -the latter measure being necessary to save him from popular fury. The action brought against him by order of the Government ended in his banishment from Piedmont. From his exile he now addresses the Armoia, with reference to the pastoral recently published by the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Turin. The children of the Devil, he says, are to-day immoderately powerful in Piedmont, and they have, over good men, the double advantage of having&all the means of infiuence at their disposal, and of considering every meaus good that serves their purpose and may promote their alima So he greatly fear that the afor aid Devil's children-tbit is to say, Count Cavour and his colleaguee, the grat majority of the late ('asnber and of the whole nation-will come victorious out of the opprowlag atruggl.. In aonequal a struggle his chief hope is in the efficacy of prayer; but the measures counselled by mere worldly prudence ancd experience are not on that account to be neglected. So he exhorts the Armona to follow up the work without wearying, and supplies a string of injunctions to be constantly and earnestly impeed upon the electors, who are to allow no favour or affection, no consideration of friendBhip, or of gratitude for services rendered, or of the talents and qualities of the candidates, to influence their votes. If they are in doubt, they are to consult ecclesiastics, and especiaUy to avoid listening to the counsels of those men who would fain conciliate God with Belial. In short, the reverend exile would have all those who desire the good of the Church and the welfare of Piedmont to put their shoulders to the wheel and make a strong effort to counteract the pernicious influences whiue he fears, with much appearance of reason, will, nevertheless, have the upper hand. It is much to be feared (by those' wvho espouse the vies of M; Fransoni) that Count Cavour andtheother descendants of the demon will find inthe Chamber which is to be elected on the 15th instant the same support that was given.tothemin the last, and that the retrograde party have still very long to wait before seeing Della Margherita in the Premier's seat, a concordat with Rome concluded, and Piedmnont reverting to old abuses andexchangingitspresent progress and liberty for a state of things not far dissimilar from that which exists in the Italian provinces of Austria and in those italian States where Austrian influence is paramount. A letter from Milan of the 8th inst. announces an earthquake on the 4th at hIenagglo, on Lake Como. It was at 2 o'clock in the morning. The moon was shining brightly, and the wasters of the lake were perfectly tranquil, when suddenly three or four gigantic waves arose and fell with such violence on the shore that aU the boats which lay at anchor were carried to the tops of the neighbouring houses and dashed to pieoes. At the. same moment a shower of stones fron the bottom of the lake was cast against the houses with a fearful noise. A huge rock was cast Into the lake at five miles from Mensggio and increased the violence of the waters. Fortunately there are but two lives to be deplored.
Ai-rry MURDIM.-A most murderous assault was committed in Torquay on Wednesday evening. The name of the unfortunate victim is Jane Stone, a young woman about 20 years of age, who had for the last three months been in the service of Mr Wills, of Warley-cottage, Tor; and the circumn stances connected with the deed, as far as they aro yet known, are these. She was for eight months In the service of Mr. Philip Michelmore, wino and spirit merchant, Union-street, and left in a state of pregnancy about three mnonths since, shortly after which time she appears to have been engaged by Mrs. Wills. A respectable young man, 21 years of age, named Jonathan Roose, nephew and assistant to Mr. Michelmore, she alleges to be the father of her forthcoming child and she farther states that he had been in the habit of supplying her with medicines with the view of pro. curing abortion. At 8 o'clock last evening she met him by appointment in a garden at the back of her mistress's hoase, and had some conversation relative to the approaching birth, an event which she anticipated within another month. The young man, she states, professed his inability to do anything for her; and then, without altercation, put his hand on her mouth, threw her to the ground, and commenced a most murderous attak, the nature of which is presumed from the subsequent discovery bard by of a large stone of a wedge-like form, weigh. ing between 41b. and 5 b and clotted with hair and blod. Mrs. Wills (who is a wviow lady), alrmed at a strange noise in the back garden, desired a neighbour to asoertain the cause; and then the poor young woman was found weltering in a large pool of blood. The sight was iutenselyhorrifying; her face and head, literally pounded, had swollen to hideous dimensions, rendering identlfica ion from her features altogether out of the question; tho skull was fractured, the jaw broken in, the nose smashed, and the temples battered in She was conveyed on a stretoher to the Torbay Infirmary, and the medical staff, deeming her chanees of recovery hopeless, sent for the magistrates. Mr. Edward Vivian and Mr. H. Phillpotts were soon in attendance, and proceeded, with the assistance of Mr. F. K. Carter, solicitor, to elicit the dying declaration of the poor safferer, from which is derived the principal portion of the above information, She distinctly averred that Jonathan [Roose had Inflicted "e injuries upon her ; and the lpoice at once apprehended bim at his uncle's residence, brought hin into the gl's presence, and at the conclusion of her deposltion removed him to tha statlonhouse, the young woman being commaitted to the care of the medical men, who were most assiduous in their attentions. This morning the magistrates attended at the Townhall, and learning that the poor girl was still sen sible determined to endeavour to obtain a more complete dgposition. The re-examination took place before Axr. a. C. M. Phillipps, Mr. B. Vivian, and Mr. H. Philipotts, and in the presencs of Roose * after which they returned to the Town-hall to complete the evidence, the only essential portion of which, so far as it affected the prl. soner, was the correspondence of ore of his shoes wit-h a footprint in the gaden. Throughout the examination, which occupied several hours, the court was most deusely crowded. The prisoner, who maintained a respe¢tfal composure, and was professmonally assisted by MAr. Prancis, soUlsitor, of Exeter, was fully comnitted to the assizes for trial on the charge of an assault with intent to oommit murder. The condition of the sufferer is at present hopeless.

This was a motion to dissolve an injunction granted two days sinoe by Vice-Chanoelior Stuart, staying an actlon in the Court of Common Pleas brought by Meea, Balfour and Anderson against the official manager on a bill of exchange for 500W. The above-named company and the Port of London Assurance Company joined their busines3 on terms, and after a long series of litigation the agreement be. tweenthemhas beenheld by the House of Lords void. For the purpose of the present motion it will be sufficient to say that the bill, among other things, sated that the defendants, Alessrs. Balfour and Anderson, had dealings9 with the Port of London Company before the complete registration of the Sea Fire Company, in respect of wbich they claimed M0(X. from the Port of London Com. pany. During the whole of the time of such dealing Mr. Alexander Davis was a shareholder in the Port of london Copmpany, and as suoh liable to that sum. That on the 1st of November, 1849, Messrs. Balfour and Anderson applied to the directors of the Sea Fire Company for payment, and obtained from Mr. A.D avis and Sir William Ogilvie a bill of exchange as follows:- "To the Mebir No. 4,D 0 Marine Departmen, Se a sre Ufe Assuraoce Port 0 lo NLon. 1, 1849, £n00. 60 dbsu after date.erdib t me-sa.

VICE-OTA TOLLTTRoP fonThrc a, t2 TORLEXY V. COOKE. (Beforc iccCkhanceUlor Sir J. STUART.) TeeUO1: V. VORLEI. These sut6 consisted of an original and a cross suit. The original suit was instituted by Vorley as assignee of a mortgage dated in December, 1851, and which purported to have been given by Cooke, the defendant in the first suit, and the pLdntiff in the second suit, to his late solicitors, for secur. m!g a balance of 780. alleged to be due from Cooke to thosegentlemen; andthe bill in the first suit prayed that Cooke might be decreed to redeem his mortge or be foreclosed. The secondsuitwasinstitutedbyCooke aainst Vorley, and the bill in such suit prayed that the alleged mortgage deed of Decoember, 1851, might be delivered up to be cancelled. It appeared that Cooke, in consequence of his having been the largest purchaser, was entitled to the custody of the title deeds of certain lands which had been sold in a great number of lot in 186, and that he was therefore called upon to enter into covenant with the pur. chasers of the other lots for the production of those title deeds, and had accordingly executed a great many of such covenants. The case on behalf of Cooke was, that his signature to the mortgage in question had been obtained upon a representation made to him by one of his solicitors that be was only about to sign a covenant for the production of title deeds. Mr. BacoD and Mr. Schomberg appeared for Mr. Vorley; and Mr. MalIns and Mir. Baggallay for Mr. Cooke. The VICECne"cLLOR said, this was a very painful case. It was a case inwhlch a bill had been ified by an assignee of a mortgage, who took his assignment withoat any communication with the mortgagor, or without his concurrence, and who now. sought to recover the amount due on that security. The alleged mortgagor made it his case that he never agreed to execute any such mortgage, and that the mortgagees of that deed were his own professional advisers, but he said that he did execute a deed which had been pus before him by one of his oonhides.tial advisers, and which he ws I tld by him was a covenant t preduce title deeds. On hehaif of the alleged mortgagor it had been stablished to the satisfaction of the Court that no right existed on the part of the alleged assignee of the mortgage to recover as against the alleged mortgagor. The difficulty in the case was that the only direct evidence on the subject was the evidence of the mortgagor himself. The Court had before it A bill filed by a person who executed the deed in question, alleging that he was defrauded in the matter of that execution, and that it was executed by him in the belief that the representation made to him by his own pro. fessional adviser that it was simply a covenant for the pro. duction of tite deeds s true. The law had made it imperative on the Court to receive as evidence a state. ment on oath made by the plaintiff himself; but he be. lieved that every Court acting on it had felt deeply im. pressed with the difficulty in adjudicating on a case where no other evidence but his own was produced in support of the case made bya p arty; therefore it seemed to hun to ba the duty of the Court to look most carefully at every collateral fact and circumstance which would tend to throw the least degree of doubt or shake the credibility of A statement on oath made by any person alone in support of his own case. The plaintiff had sworn in the Plainest and most direct terms to the truth of that case which he had averred, and his evidence had not been in the least degree shaken. Indeed, everything that had been done by the assgnee ef the mortgage went to confirm the statement made by the plaintifi The plaintiff swore that he had been invited by his solicitor to go to a ocrtain place for the purpose of executing a covenant for the production of title deeds, he (the plaintiff) having previously executed many -uch, perhaps a hundred, prep4-ed by the same solicitors, and, in eplyto a questionby him,he wastoldths.this was thelas' of these deeds. There was nothingtoshow that his solicitors had appedeb to him to execate a mortgage for any sum which might be due by him to his solicitor6, or that indeed any snm was due by him to them. The Court always regarded with great jealousy any mortgage transactions which took place teween solicitors and clients without the intervention of another professional man to protect the interests of the client. Another view tended materially to strengthen the plaintiff's case. These solictors were men in embarrassed circumstances, and they had so misconducted themselves that they on account of otber frauds and improper conduct, had felt themselves obliged to abscond. The plaintiff and the defendant the asignee of the mortgage were, moreover. two honest and respectable farmers, a class which of all others was most in the pow;er of professional men. Here, then, was a case in which the plaintiff had never agreed to give 3nmortgage and had never acknowledged that a debt of 7801. was due by him, and theref ore the claim of the assignee of the mortgagee to recover upon it could not be enter. tamced.

COURT OF OUSNS EENOFw.L W -v w- , THE ROYAL BRITMIH BGANK. (SWings in Banco, before Lord CAlPBXeLL and Justices COLPIXRGN antd WIaHTMN.1 TE QUEEN V. ESDAILE AND OTHERS. Mr. EDWIN JAMES, QC. (with whom was Mr. Aapland), said he was instructed on the part of the defendants in this case to apply to the Court for a role calling upon the Attorney-General to show cause why he should not deliver to the defendants a particular and statement of the offenees and charges intended to be made against the defendants. The learned counsel said that this was one of several informa. tlons which had been filed against certain directors and others connected with the Royal British Bank. The first was the case of " The Queen v. Esdaile and Others " the second, " The Queen v. Brown and Others ;" and the third, " The Queen v. Stapleton and Others." The present application was inade in the first case (" The Queen v. Esdaile aud Others"), and it was for a rule calling on the AttorneyGeneral to show cause why he should not deliver to the defendants particulars stating the specific charges intended to be made in support of the second, fourth, 8ixth, eighth, and tenth counts of the information filed by the AttorneyGeneral Pgainst certain directors for a misdemeanour alleg-ed to have been committed in reference to the Royal British Bank. The information contained 12 counts, and the 12th count was a general count for a conspiracy. An application had been made to Mr. Justice Crompton that theAttorney-General should give thepartioulars nowapplied for, but though his Lordship made an order that particulars should be given of the 12th count, his Lordship referred the applcants to this Court with respect to their application on the other counts. The learned counsel said, he thought it reasonable that the Attorney-General should either say that the counts referred to were counts on whioh he did not intend to rely, or that he should specify the charges. The learned counsel then referred to the information, and said that each specifio count setting out the charges was followed by a general count. Lord CAMP3ELL.-The odd numbers are specifio, and the even numbers are general. Mr. JAES said that was so. The first count alleged certain speciafc charges, and set out a report which it alleged the defendants published to the world, &c. ; and that was followed by a general count, in which it was alleged that the defendants, being evil disposed persons, and with a wish to defraud, confederated and aeed together to publish certain statements to the shareholders with intent to defraud. That was a general charge, and the defendants wished to know whether the evidence in support of that count was the same as was applicable to the special count, or whether it was intended to make a specific charge. In the former case the defendants would be satisfied; but it it was intended to make another specific charge under the general count, they wished the particulars to be given; otherwise an enormous net would he thrown over them. Lord CAMPBELL said the defendants ought to know what they were charged with, and if the charge was so general that they did not know what it was, they ought to have the particulars. Mr. JAMSs then cited the decision of Lord Denman in the case of the " Queen v. Kenrick " in support of his application. Lord CAanPBELL observed that In that case Lord Denman miht have referred to the case of Queen Caroline, but probably he did not like to do so. It was much to be regretted in Queen Caroline's case that a particular of the evidence was not given to her before what is caUed her trial came On. MIr. JAscEs.-Some of the general counts charged the defendants with obtaining money by false pretences, and of those false pretences they were entitled to have the particulars. In the case of " the Queen v. Hamilton and Others" (7 C. and P., 748), where the indictment contained a count for a conspiracy in a general form, Mr. Justice Littledale dir,cted particulars ol the charges to be given, and that the defendants might have the same information in resuect to the general count as was given by the spe¢ific count. Lord CAMPBLELL said that, as Mr. Justice Crompton had allowed the particulars on the 12th count, the learned counsel wished the same principle to be applied to the other counts. Mr. JAScEs said that was what he desired. Probably, the Attorney-General might say that the alternate counts were only a repetition of the specific counts; and if that was so It would be sufficient. The learned counsel said the eighth count was a general count, for obtaining money " by fabe pretences j" and he wanted particolars of the false pretenc. Lord CAMPBELL Said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. THE QUEEN V. K1N'EDY AND VALIANT. At a subsequent period of the day, Mr. D. D. KEAN made a gimilar application to the Court on the part of the above defendaRts. 'i'he COURnT granted the application. Rule nisi granted. TSE NORTH STAFFORDSHIlRE RAILWAY COMPANY V. THE LONDON AND NORTH-WESTZEN RAILWAY COMPANY, This was a special case for the opinion of the Court. The action was brought by the North Staffordshire Raiway Company against the London and North-Westen Raia way Company to recover damages for the breach of an agreement which had been made between the parties, under 'which it was alleged the defendants were bound to send. their through traffio to Manchester along the North Staffordshire line, and to make up a dividend of 4 per cent. to the shareholders of that company. The declaration a2so contained a count for the use of the plaintiffs' line of railway. The defendants pleaded as many as 39 pleas. The case came on for trial before Lord Campbell at Gaildhall on the 26th of February, 1856, but the case was no sooner opened than it was agreed that all the facts should be stated in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court. This had accordingly been done, at very great length, referring to numerous documents connected with the proceedings of Parliament, &o., but finally raising five questions for the opinion of the Court, as folows:- 1. Whether any such contract as is stated, in any and which of the special counts of the declaration, was entered into by the defendants ? 2. Whether the application to Parliament for the amalgamation of the two companies has been rejected three times by Parliament upon merits, and not merely on formal points ? 3. Whether, if any such contracts were entered into, the same, or any, and which of them, are or is legally binding upon the defendants? 4. Whether the action with respect to the sum claimed for the half-year ending on the 30th day of June, 1855, has or has not been brought too saon? 5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover any snm under the common counts of the declaration, and, if so, upon what principle the amount is to be ascertained? Sir F. THESGEsR (with whom were Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Quain) was heard for the Vlaintiffs; and Sir F. KELLY (with whom were Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Phip. son) for the defendants. The discussion turned chiefly on the question of ultra vires, raised by the third question, and on the second question, as to whether, under the circumstances, an application made to Parliament for an amalgamation of the two companies had been rejected "upon merits," or "merely on. formal points." The Court decided the latter question in favour of the defendants, and as it was understood the case would be taken to a court of error, the Court gave judgmont generaly for the defendants, but without expressing a distinct opinion on the other questions. Lord OAats'nguL said the Court was called upon to say whether the application to Parliament for the amalgamation of the two companies bad been rejected three times by Parliament " upon merits," and "not merely on formal points," and his opinion was that ithadbeenrejectedthree timesupon raerits, and not merely on formal points. It was alowed that it had been twice rejected, and the question was whether what took place on the first proceeding was a rejection of the BiUl " upon merita." What were the words of the agreement? They were these:-" The two companies to apply to Parliament at their joint expense in the next Eession for immediate powers to the above elFect, and in caee of failure to renew the application in succeeding sessions-; should Parliament three times reject the application upon merits, and not merely upon formal points, the engagement between the two companies to cease." What was the meaning of that stipulation ? That might be satisfactorily got at by looking at the words, " and not merely upon formal points," which meant in case the standing orders had not been complied with, or that some notice happened not to have been given, or that there had been some irregularity. He (Lord Campbcel) thought that the Bil had been rejected on the merits, and not upon formal points. That it was rejected was admitted, hut was it rejected upon }erits within the meaning of the agreement? It was rejected because the House of Commons thought it ougbt not to pass,-not on any formal points, but because they thought no amalgamation BiUs ought topag during that session of Parliament. They thought it contrary to publio policy that any amalgamation Bills should pass during that session of Parliament. That ground applied to all amalgamation Bils as weU as to this particular one. His Lordship here referred to the proceedings in the Hotse of Commons, as set out in the special case, as follows -In the said session of Parliament of the years 1853 (in which eession the aforesaid Bill for the anmalgamation of the plaintiffs and defendants' company had beer. Introduced into Pari ment-s,17 on the ith of December, 1852) a select commnittee of the House c ;omicons was appointed to consider the principle of amalgamation as a.pl=ed torailway or railway aud canal BmUe about to be brought under tto consderation of Parliamnnt, and to consider the psintiple which oup ht to guide the Houee In railway legislatlon," 'What was done by that committee? It was stated that- " Eidence, as bearing upon the general principle of amalaomation and the courne of legislation with sespect to arnalgasnation Bills, Wa tone Into touehing various Bills then before the Hones. annc amour others the plaintiffs'aLd defendants' BiUll which was sPeciallY referred to; and particular objections were made to it by the partiea connected with the canl nteresetoon the ground of the Inexpediency of aulowing the aciniattln by the defendants of the cana'!, then Yested in the It appeared that this very Bill was bronght before the committee, and its merits so far considered, and that they zeported to the House against the passing of any amalgamnation Bills. The House of Commons, upon that report, came to a resolution- "That no rallwayorcanal Bih containiganypowersofamalgat atl purchase. lease. workiog arrangement, or other combination of interest etwcen different railw& orcanal couspaltes heretofore incorporated, be funther proceeded wit1, unless the parties interested in promoting ecuh Buil ehsal elect to proceed with the tame on the terms ot striking out in cimmittee all such powers aforesaid," &c. Having considered the subject of amalgamation BiUs, and this very Bill, they came to a general resolution which applied to this Bill, as well as to all the others. He (Lord Campbell) considered that that was a rejection of the Bill "uuon merits," and " not merely on formal points," th in tho meaning of the agreement. He therefore felt bound to answer the second question in the affirmative, and to give judgment for the defendants. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE and Mr. Justice W Ir G&N gave judgment to the same effect. A long discussion then took place as to how much the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover in zespect of traffic under the money counts; but it wars eventually agreed that this question should b0 settled by an arbitrator, upon the prinolpie hereafter to be laid down by the Court of Judgment for the defendants. BAIL COURT. (Sitg8 at Ki8i Prius, before Mtr. JuAstice EBRT and Common Juries.) BARETT V. CLAPKE. Mr. Keane and Mr. H. T. Cole were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Berjeant Parry and Mr. Needham for the dtefendant. This was an action brought by a provision dealer againmt another tradesman for slander, in saying that what the plaintiff sold was very bad, and that he would sell anything so that he could get a profit, although it was only fit for dogs' meat. In the course of the tzial Mr. Serieant PARRY said that he could not justify the defendant's conduct, and must ex- esshis regret that he should have used suoh language. We would consent to a verdiot for 40s., as there was no wish on the part of the plaintiff to have any triumph. Mr. KEAXN said that the plaintiff only wished to protect himself. He did not wish to oppress a neighbour; all he wanted, therefore, was to be indemnified from the costs, and to hope to live on good terms with his neighbour, Mr. Justice ERLs said in his opinion the defendant's legal advisers had acted with great good sense and much for the defendant's benefit. The plaintiff had acted with great forbearance and kindness, and had the case gone on the defendant might have had better teason for remembering his gthe Judge's) observations to the jury and their verdict, and he trusted this would enter into the defendant's mind.| Verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 40s., with the judge's certificate for costs. AUSTEN V. BRIDGET. Mr. Iilley and Mr. Pearce were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine for the defendant. This was an action for breach of promise of marriage. The plaintiff was the servant of the defendant, who was' a person of some property. She became in the familyway, and then the defendant several times stated that it was his intention to make her his wife. He was In the habit of saying to her when she was living with her father, previous to her confinement, " Well, Polly, it won't be long before I take you away," and she would answer, "I don't care how soon, for BIm not comfortable here." The defendant, however, said he could not marry her until his youngest son was settled. He kept his ca rie. It was stated that there were no letters, because thc defendant could not write. Upon one occasion the defendant said the plaintiff was in the familyway, and if she could love him well enough to be his wife he would marry her. The father of the plaintiff sald,-I called at the defendant's and walked about the garden with him. My daughter was in the familvway. We were going to her cousin's to tea. She took the defendant's arm, and I walked by their side. I was once in the defendant's drawing-room and had a glass of gin and water, and then I went Into the kitchen to supper. I rode in the defendant's carriage with him. He brought my daughter to my housecin his carriage, and said he wanted her to stay there about a month. She then went by the name of Mrs. Bridget. He told me if she could love him well enough he would marry her. When I afterwards told him of his promise he denied it. Croexaezmined..I had no idea of her being in the family. way untl I saw it.

She was very ill and obllged to leave her lace. y cousintook care of my daughter's child until it ed. The defendant allowed her 78 a-week fortaking care of the child. I do not know that Polly has another lover, a tailor in the Strand. She never said a young man was courting her. I never heard a yotng man say it wa his child. Re-examined.-The defendanttold mehe must wait tllhs son was married before he could take her home. My daughter is 25. Jane Austen.-I am ccsin to the plaintiff'g father ; he lives with me and my husband. The defendant brought the plaintiff and the baby in his carriage to our house at =attersea, and he took me in his carriage to Bermondsey. He told meI should nothave my cousin morethana month, and then his son would be married, and he should take Polly away and makeher his wife. Polly saidshe did not care how soon, as she was tired of leading that kind of life. I was godmother to the child. The chid died at my house. The defendant wanted me to bury it as though it was my chid. I told him I could not think of doing any such thing. The defendant told me hfs'son wasmarried, and I said, " Then, I suppose you will takeccousin home ?" He said, " It won't be ong first." He afterwards wanted me to persuade cousinto go and live with him again as his servant. I said I could do no such thing, as I did not think it proper. I told him I did not think he was a gentleman for not keen- ing his word. He said, " Well, I think you are pretty jol blunt." He afterwards said he could not marry her, as he found he should have hell upon earth. Cross-examinod.-We summoned the defendant for LZ. for rent. He paid It into court. No one used to court Polly but Mr. Bridget. I don't know the young tailor in the Strand. James Clarke.-I am a baker living opposite the defend. ant, who carries on business under the firm of Bridget and Co. I believe he has no partner. I consider it a smaU affair, He keeps three business horses. I nevor knew him keep a carnlage. He )ives in the Deptford Lower-road. I bfve seen hira work as a common man in his mll. Mr. Serijeat BALLANMJ addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant. Ther was no doubt the defendant was a person of moderate means. Hewas sure they would not adopt a story because It was sworn to. If they found the witnesses were worthy of credit it would give weight to their testimony, but if they did hot approve their conduct it would alter that opinion, and would induce them to find a verdict for the defendant. The parties to a case of this kind could not be called as witnesses; they must therefore fall back upn the evidence and look at the probabilities of the case. Te father did not appear to be very indignnut on hearing the state of his child. He had a conversation, and then went to the drawing-room and took a glass of ginand.water with his daughter's seducer, and finished off with a supper. What wae the probability of the promlse being then made? Would not the father have said then, "Let us have it over before her character has been inured b her giving birth to an illegitimate child?' Couldh. have allowed the matter to go on until after the birth? The defendant could do no more than he had done-deny it. He submitted that the whole of the circumstances were so improbable that the jury would not believe the siory of the promise. Mr. Justice ExLE summed up. The question was whether the promise was made. The plaintiff allegedthat there was a promise, in consequence of which familiarities were pernitted wbich ended in pregancy, and that that promise waa reqently repeated. The wa In which the matter vas disolosed to the father was wortKy of their consideration. Certainly it was received by the father with uncommon equanimity. Would the jury ask themselves what was the meaning of this fact, that from October, 1856, down to October, 1857, no demand was made by this young woman or her friends for the fulfiling of a promise which had been previously made? Instead of that she went into service, and went to Paris. They must look at it as men acquainted with human nature. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damag 501. This Court will sit again on Monday.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WvsmTIw 1'hnv 1- CABRPNTER V. PARKERX. (Sittings in Banco, Mi4uzdmas Term.) m SIns case tile (OURT this morning delivered judgment for the plaintiff. The case came before the Court as a special case, and t-he question raised was whether the defendant, who claimed under the lessor of the plaintiff b tite paramount, was a disturber of the plaintiff under his lease ot certain premises, and had broken a covenant in the lease for quiet enjoyment in having evicted the plaintiff. Judgment for the pla1ntIfft BEDFORD V. THE WARDEN AND SOCIETY OP SUTTON COLD. FIELD. This case came before the Court in the form of a special case. Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Garth appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, nd Mr. Serjeant Byles for the defendant. The questions raised were whether the plaintiff, as rector of Sutton Coldfield, was entitled to recover from the owners, as distinct from the occupiers, the whole rentcharge for which his tithes were commuted in respect of the whole property. A second question was whether the rector was entitled to recover, as against the same owner, a rentcharge ia respect of lands acquired since the commautation, under an Enclosure Act; and, thirdly, whether the plaintiffs remedy was by action or distress. These questions turned on the construction of an Act of Parliament passed in 1824 for the purpose of enclosing the waste lands in the pariah of Sutton Coldfield, and ahgo for commuting the tithes into a rentoharge. The argument occupied the day. The COURT took time to consider its judgment. It was announced that two of their Lordlhips having to ;at in the Court of Criminal Appeal to-morrow, the Court will not Sit. (tSing8 at Nisi Prius, at Westminter, before Mr. .TuW CrESSWELL and a Common Jury.) RIX AN1D WIFE V. LINWOOD. Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Wood for the defendant. On the morning of the 17th of February last Mrs. Rix, -vho is a weaver, was proceeding along Edward-street, Bethnal-green, and on passing the manufactory of the defendant, a fringemaker, she fell on to a grating which gave light to one of the lower rooms of the building and injured herself seriously. Both she and the other witnesses called to support the case for the plaintiffs stated that the accident waa to be attributed to the fact that the wooden frame of the grating had become decayed and out of repair; that it had sunk below the level of the footway in such a manner as that the iron bars of the trap stood up from the surface of the road, and it was urged that Mrs. Rix had caught her foot in the depression or hole so formed, and that it being the duty of the defendant to keep the grating, as an adjunct to his premises, in good repair, he was liable for the damnage which had ensued by his negligence in not having done Several witnesses were caUed to prove the plaintai case and among other things It was sworn that after the accident to Mr Rix the grating had been put in repair, and the defendant had been seen overlooking the workmen who were engaged on the work. On the part of the defendant, however, although it was admitted that Mrs. Rix had fallen on to the grating, and that if such fall was occaioned by the bad state of the frame he was liable, yet it was entirely denied that the grating was ever out of repair, and Mr. Linwood said that t was now exactly in the same state as it always had been for years,-namely, in goed order and seoure. Some trifling repair had been done to the roadway by the commissioners, but that was alL. MX. Justicoe CRESSWELL having summed up to the jury with great minuteness, they foand a verdict for the defendant. TOOREY V. THE LON-DON, BRIG}ETON, AMD SOUTH COAST PULILWAY COMPANY. This was an action brought by the plaiatiff, a hawker, to recover damages for an injury which he sustained at the Forest-hil station on the night of the 11th of June last, on which occasion, while wandering about in search of the door usually labelled " For Gentlemen," not being able to read, he entered that marked " Porters' lamp-room," and fell down a ait of steps, Bo fracturing his ribs and other. wise rziou1yg surtrng himself. In the course of the trial, It appearing that the platform was well lighted, so that the inscriptions on the doors were legible, Mr. Justloe CRSt w1!:LL said that he should tll the jury that there was no evidence of negli ence. Mr. Serjeant PiGoTr observed teat the company might have looked the door of the porters' room. Mr. Justice CRESSWELL then suggested that the amount of damages should be agreed upon, and that the defendant should have leave to move the Court to enter a verdict for such amount, if the other learned judges should consider that hirulng was wrong. This course was adopted, and the plaintiff was nonsuited accordingly. Mr. 5erjeant Pigott and M1r. Pearce were counselfor the plaintiff, and Mr. Creasey appeared for the defendants.
COURT OF EXCHEOTER. 'rAv vn, 1¶i N1r% TRIAL PAPE:B (Sittiva inrBang.n. ABBOT V. FXARY. This was an aetion on a blll of exchange for 3501., -which purorted to have been accepted by the defendant, but had really been forged by one Elarradine, and by him discounted -with and endorsed to the plaintif lt appeared at the trial that the defendant and Harradine were neighbourina farmers, and that, after a series of accommodation bins hag bcen drawn and accepted between them, Harradlne took upon himself to forge the defendant's name to renewaQs, and even to draw checks on the defendant's bankers, always, however, taking up the first, and paying In moneys to meet the latter. Eventually Harradine came to a dead. lock and absconded, leaving various forged acceptancts in the market. Among others was one in respect of which the defendant was sued at Cambridge besiWs by the holder, whio recovered the full amount. After that the present action was brought and. tried before the Chief Baron in Middlesex, when it was shown that the plaintiff, being the holder of another acceptance of the defendant, which, though not produced, was almoet assumed to have been forged by Harradine, for whom be had discounted it, wrote to the defendant a letter stating the fact that his acceptance would fall due on a certain day. The defendant dd not take any notice of this communication, and a day or two after the bill had been presented at the bankers and dishonoured some one called and took it up. It was also shown that the defendant was cognizant of the fact that Harradino bad forged checks upon him as above stated. The defendant denied that he ever had autborized Harradine to use his name on the present bill, but it was left to the jury by the learned audge to say whether by his general conduct towards Harradine he had accredited his acts and the form of acceptance, so as to hold himself out to the plaintiff as liable for those acts and signatures. The j7ry found for the plaintiff, and this was a rule to enter a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that there was no evidence to go to the jury of any authority by the defendant to Harradine to accept this bill in his name, or for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection generally. Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Serjeant Wells, and Mr. Hawkins showed cause; Mr. O'Maley and MIr. Couch appeared in sup,port of the rule. The COURT, at the conclusion of the arguments, which occupied nearly the whole day, Intimated that they would take time to consider. (Sftings at Nsi Prius, before Mr. Baron MAjavrs and Common Juries). MYERS V. HART. This was an action brought to recover a aum of 1221. 12s. inr goode sold and delivere The defendant pleaded never Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Petersdorff appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Hawlkins represented the defendant. It appeazed that both of the parties were members of the Jewish persuasion, and the action arose out of a dispute between them relative to the sale by the plaintiff to the defendant of some damaged canvass which the former had bought at a sale of old Government stores. The chief questions were whether there had been an acceptance by the defendant of the goods, and whether there had been a warranty of the goods by the plaintiff. The jury eventually returned a verdlet for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.
ADMURALTY COT.T w A - 0 Tr7n: RfVA r. r (Befo^re D-. LVS;m.N This was en action `up1on a bottomry bond for 4,000 dollars and interest, dated the 5th of February, 1856, held by Mr. Mahlon Vail, of Nevw York, whose claim was res d by Messrs. Black, of Halifax, in Nova Scotia, the holders of a mortgnge of the vessel, dated the 4th of Jume, 1856. It appeared that the Royal Arch, having sutained consideable damage on her voyage from Glagow to New York, the master, Kenney, applied to l*. igleo Vai to advance a sum sufficient for the necessary repair The money Wa advanced by Mr. M. Vail, who required a bottomry bond as security. The master communicated with Mr. Archi. bald Camupbhel, adpdart Nower and the managing owner of theessl, ho esiedin ova~goia,a~Mr, A, Campboll, after Borne hesitation, authorized hism to give the bottomry bond. By that instrument the sum of $4,000 with interest woa agreed to be paid on or before the expiration of five days next after the Arrival of the bark at a port of discharge in the United States, or a port of discharge in any of the bsh provinces in North America, to one of which the muter bound himself to return. The veesel did return aecordingly to the port of New York; but five davs having elapsed without payment of the no'nev an agreement was entered into, on the 29th of May, l856. between Mahlon Vail, Archibald Campbell, and Mr. Ken iey for the extension of the timae for the payment of the money until five days next after the Arrival of the hark at a port of discharge in the United States or t a port of diechrge in any of the British provinces in North Amezics, "excepting her present trip to Liverpool, In Nova Scotia." The vessel tben proceeded to Liverpool, in NovaScotia, the gort of her ownerp afterwards to the West Indieg, and then back to Liverpool, in Nova Scotia.

The interests, if not the neoessties of commer.e supported him in that opinion. A more inportant objection had, however, beei taken to the bond-viz., that this t.-ansactionwanotorigi a botttomry transaction. But lotong atall the rcumstanc of the cas he wastunable to pronounce against the validity of the bond upon that ground. It was also objected that this could not be pronounced a bottomry bond, because the interest payable uponthemone avaneedwasnot morethan the legal interest aliowed o the State of Noew York But the rate of interest ws acmere matter of agreement,etweenthe partie and the Court would not, merely on account of the rate of Interest tierted, pronounce that an instrument denomienatin ttse a bottonmayt bond was not a bottomry bond. For lthe reasons he was of opinion that the bond was originally valid. It was not necessary for him to say whether it would have been valid without the consent of Mr. Camp-, bell, andh hethought thatthe consentof thateentlean, as the managng owner, was sufficient to bind the other par' owner Btxt the most difficult part of the case remained to be cponsidered. The paymet of the bond having been postponed what was the legal effect of that postponement? Abtmieg that the agreement of the 29th of May was bind'n upon the owners, would it avail against the maortgagees othe 4th of June? The agreement waswanting in allthe Ingredients necessary to constitute a valid bottomry transaction. The maritime risk contemplated by, the original bond was at an end at the date of the agreement, and there -was no proof of distress, of want of necessaies, or absence of personal credit, The agreement did not create a new bottomiry bond, but postponed the payment of the money secured by the old bend, and the present suit could hardly be said, therefore, to be founded upon a bottomry bond, as It was founded upon a bottomry bond and an agreement. Great inustice anid inconveeniene might arise from the postp-onement of the claim of the mortgagees to that of the bondholder, and the Court had always been exceedingly cautious in dealing with the Interests of persons in their situation. By pronounaoing for the claim of the bondlholder the Com- would be giving effect not to the original bend, but to the agreement, and that he was clearly of opinion was beyond his power. He should therefore declare that the Court had no powver to enforce the bond and the agreement, but he should give no costs, because the case raised several difficult questions The consideration of those qestion had cost himf a great dealof abor, ad, lthug¾ e hd nt be en able to find anyautoriy barig drecly ponthecase, he thought This was a vesse which had been found at Kertch abandoned by her crew and scuttledl.

COUET OF BANKRU.PTOY, B nghall-st. Nov. L IN IL TJ WflTIMT.R AT.V (Befomr JAf. I The bankrupt w as a merchsat of Birch) nole. A nroof having been admitted against his estae by Messrs. Laing and carpbel, there bas been a long pending investigation, the object being to oreatly reduco the amount, or to show indeedthat Messrs. mLing and Campbel hwerevdebtors to thbe estate. The case will be best understood in the form of a narratire Itapperedthat in the year 1864 Joseph Windle Colecrre on business in the city as a merchant. He occasionaly required accommodation in thte shape of advances upon securities, and among the persons who v ere in the habit of thus accommodating him were Messrs. Laing and CampbeUt. Cole, howvever, does not appear to have pur8ued as legitimate trade, for about Augut, 1854, he was arrested upon a charge of obtaining advances upon fictitious warrants, and of which charge he was subsequently convicted. He was, immediately after the charge had been preferred, made bankrupt, and in September Messrs. Laing and Co. duly presented their p roof against the estate for l1,8551., being in respect of a balanto clue to them on advances. The proof was on that occvslQn admitted, "sabject to investigation," aud Mr. Lai4g was c.hosen assignee. Upon the goods held by Messrs. Laing at the time of the bankruptcy being realized more favourably than wras anticpated it was found that a less sum was dte from the bankrupt than the p roof had been admitted for, andtheamountwas reduced, at the instance of Wesszs, Laing and CampbelL. A further reduction of 2001. was subsequently made, in consequence of an error in a charge of interest. Matters then restedi for ssveral months, and, a dividend being in course of payment, a letter from Mr. John H. Preston, solicitor, of 9, Carey-street, was received by Mr. Murray, the solicitor to the ssignees, applying on behalf of the bankrupt for a day to be fixed for the bankrupt and all other parties to be examined in the investigation, which, in justie to the bankrupt and his estate, Mr. Preston considered ought to be proceeded with in respect to Messrs. Laing and Campbell's and other parties claimus then standing over for Information. An inquiry was then proceeded with bv Mr. Preston, and the evidence of Mr. Laing was taken at much lengtb, the main point at issue being as to whether Messrs. Laing and CampUellhad dtly accounted for all the cochineal and other goods the bankrupt had deposited with them. Mr. Laing pledged his word that everything had been duly accounted *or, andprodnoed his books to support his statement. On the part of creditors who instructed Messrs. Preston and Webb it was contended that Messr. Laing and Co. were bound to produce a list of all the cochineal and other warrants received by him. Mr. laing, however, alleged that this was not the castom of business, and tbat the vouchers had been destroyed. Mr. Laing contended that the whole affair was an attempt at revenge on the part of Cole, whose fraudulent career he had tut a stop to. y means of the charge, it was urged, Cole ad frequently obtained for himself a sort of fcte-day at the Court of Bankruntcy-a great relief from the position in which he was placed in his prison quarters at another part of the town. On the other hand, it was urged that the reductions already made in the amount of Mlessrs. Laing and Co.'s proof furnished strong grounds for investigation. tis HoNaO E, in now giving judgment, said that, although Messrs. Laing and Campbell had not been quite so cautious as they might have been, by preserving the vouchers of the cochineal, &c., he acquitted them of any ill or dishonest m-otive or intention to put other people's money into their own pockets. Up to the third examination into the matter the proceedings of the creditors prosecuting It might have been bond jfde enough, but after that time it was nothing more than what might be termed a " fishing" expedition. The proof of Messrs. Laing and Campbell would stand at the sum of 6,8749. Is. 9d., to which it had been reduced prior to the investigation. The costs of the assignees, except as to those of the three first meetings, would be paid by the creditors m oving in the proceedings, because by that time the creditors in question must have felt that the statements of a person like Cole would not weigh against those of Messrs. Laing and CampbelL essrs. Laing and Campbell would pay their own costs in the matter. He must say that he (the Comamissioner) having to act both as judge and jury cowld not credit Cole's statements, which were entirely unsupported by documentary evidence. Mr. Bagley (instructed by Messrs. Preston and Webb) appeared to prosecute the inquiry; MIr. Lawrano appeared for Messrs. Laing and Campbell, and Mr. Murray appeared for the asgnees. There were several meetings befor other Commissioners, but the proceedings passed off without any feature of publi¢ interest.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-3r. Edoa-rhas issued a manifesto and declared war against the Exeter-hall services. Though the " dutiful and obedient servant" of the Bishop, he puts his veto on the movementwhloh his diocesau not only expressly sanctioned, but publicly defended in the House of Lords. The grounds on which Mr. Edouart tries to justify his undutiful con duct are, obedience to the Canon law and maintenance of the parochial system. As to the first Few people have taken the trouble to rummage over t hat venerable relic of antiquity, and probably Mr. Edouart himself is indebted for his present legal acquirements to some attorney who has a penchant for ecclesastioal suits. This attempt to oppose an earnest and authorized effort for the spread of Christianity by some intricate subtlety of the Canon law is like attempting to turn out the reporters of the press by enforcing standing orders of the House of Commons, which forbid the introduction of strangers. As to our parochial system, which Mr. Edonart seems to consider the chief means by which we can "hold fast the form of sound words," it was established to secure the preaching of the truth to every one. It was not intended to enthrone certain funetionaries in a position in which they could hinder others from supplying the deficLieuios of the less zealous. Stil less did it authorire these would-be monopoLsts to say that their opposition to the Divine command, " Preach the truth to every creature," was "holding fast the form of sound words." If Mr. Edonart's and other churches were filled with the working classes there would be little need of these services. But! alas! but few workdng men are to be found in London churches. Mr. Edouart says they failed on a former occasion. Was it a failure for a hall holding 3,00 or 4,000 to be crammed, and hundreds going away who could not get in? That a large proportion of these were of the working classes any one who knows them would acknowledge. This is confirmed by the clergyman of one of the poorest parishes, who says that his congregation was increased by working men who had been induced by hearing the Exeter-hall services to attend their parish churoh. And now that a etep has been taken E towar adapting our machinery of preaching to the wants of the masses for whom It was pre-eminently inteuded-a step which has been encouraed by the highest ecclesiastical authorities, and hailed with delight by the public at largeIt is illtimed to attempt to check a national movement for a astional benefit by individual tenacity to an antiquated system of medizeval Law. I subscribe myself vour obedient servant A JiEAL SUPPORT. O rMvva. nrrDnr -Nov. 13.
1SPZ AL& SnRVICES FOIB TrE WORKON CLASSSS.- The cominittee being advised that after their prohibition by the incumbent, the Rev. A. G. Edouart, the services In Exeter-hall would be held by the ecclesiastical law to be Ilegal, have felt themselves under the necessity of suspending, them. The services will, however, be renewed as soon as some other convenient pLace can be found, of which due notice will be given. *EXvIiDI)D EPISCOPL AND MISSIONA RYZ OPERATIONS IN INhDIA.-The Archbishop of Canterlbury has consented to preside over a public meeting which is to be held on the 26th inst. for the purpose of aiding the Society for the.Propagation of the Gospel in carrying out the following measures:-I. To double (at least) tie number of the society's European rnissionarias in India, and to promote by every avMAkble means the education, traif zv, and ordination of e 9more advanced native converts .ar the work of the ChrL. .si m iistry among their own countryr_on. 2. To found new =& engthen existin" missions in the predldential and other principal cities of India wherever there may appear to be the best opening, with a view to bring the truths ox Christianity before the minds of the upper as well as of the lower elasss in those great oentres of population. 3. To press again upon the attention of the Indian Govern. ment the argen tmecessity of a subdivision of the enormous dioceses of Calculia and xadras, and especially to insist upon -the.desirableness of establishing a bishopric for tie Punjab, auother for theNffith-Western Provinces, -and a third for the Province of Tinnevelly. 4. To encourage the establishment of industadal boarding schools, both for boys and girls, as the bedt mems of improving the habits and tone of mind of the nAtiveCnristian community. In addition to the new bishoprwcs akove mentioned, the archbishoe and bishops who form the council of the society are of oplion that ere many years it wil be necessary etill further to provide for the extension of sees, and that anew bishopric must be ereated for Arraean, Pegue, and Tenasserim* oae forAssam and the North-i bst frontiQr; one for Orissa, and one for Eerar, Saugor, and the ceded districts on the Ncrbudda. These, however, they do not intend at the present to )ress upon the attention of the Governrment.

IRBLAND. (sFox oUR oWN CORsPOwnrn I DUIBLIN, PFRnAY MOREMIG. THE MONETAIY CRIasS. A highly influential meeting of the leading merchants and manufacturers of Belfast was held there on Wednesday for the purpose, it would appear, of declaring their full confidence in the stabihty of the lbanks of Belfast. There being no dissenting opinion upon the isubject, the proceedings of course were characterized by the greatest possible armount of unanimity. Commenting upon this step, the Whig, the leading commerial journal, observes - I Everyone who has read anecdotes of Curran is familiar with the story of the witness who, before entering on his orosa-examination by the searching advocate, handed into the Court a certificate of good characetr, thus defending himself by anticipation from any asperafons that might be cast upon him. This is jst what has been done in the case of the Belfast banks, A number of ourleading merchants and I manufacturers, representing the wealth and worth of the community, assembled yesterday to do what it strikes ua was a very aupererogatory piece of business-to declare their full confidence in the stability of our local baning institutions. So far, at least, as regards the town of Belfast, any vote of confidenoe of tho kind w&a3 wholly unnecessary-of which, indeed, the names of the gentlemen composing the meeting is the 3most convincing proof. It may, to be sure, be the case that, in some of the country districts, a panic has been created, and a 'run,' as it is called, on the branches of the Belfast banks ensued. If there has been anything of this kind, the meeting yesterday should restore confidenoe, though it is Just possible 4 that, among the timid and ignorant, it may produce the very consequence that the resolutions passed sought to avert. We earnestly trait, not so much for the sake of the banks, but for the sake of those doing business with them, that this may not be the cae. Any unnecessary 1 alarm must have the effect of paralysing, to a greter or less degree, commercial operations, and would produce a general stagnation, of which the commercial classesL ould be the firdt to feel the injury. In these days, when concerns have failed which have long been lookea upon almost as secure as the Old Lady oI Threadneadle-atreet herself, it is somewhat hazardous and presumptuous to spenk with anything approaching to certanty of any establlshment. Forfitew, however, as we are by the aTthority of the gantlemen who met in the corn exchange, yesterday, and by the general expression of feeling in the town, we shall not be considered rash if we express it as our opinion that the Belfast banks are as sound and stable-as able to meet any liabilities-as the Inost eminent jointstock firms in Great Britain. We shall obtain all the more credit for sinoerity in saying this, when it Is remembered that we have never been in any shape the organ of the Belfast banks; but that, on the contrary, it is not so very long since that we devoted a series of articles to what we considered abuses and shortcom. ings in tho management of them one and all; and for which we assure our readers we did not win the special favour of bank directors. We have not ourselves heard of any considerable run on the country branches of any of the Belfast banks; but if there have been such a foolish movement, the meeting of yesterday sbould check it, so far as sensible, intelligent men are concerned." The Banner of Ulster commnends§ the object of the meeting as being tcalculated to strengthen confidence durinzg the prevalence of the monetary crisis, and adds these remarks . "The caution and prudence of the directors of the banks in Belfast have had the best effect on their castomers; and hence, for several months past, the latter asn a class have Iheen aCting with the greatest wariness. Overtrading, as it is termed, has had no existenoe in thi quarter; nor are the stocks of goods held by the most sanguine of our manufacturers so large as to cause them to force sales at ruinous discounts. e hear a great outcry about the rate of interest charged at the banks, bat high as that cost of accommodation is, it falls far short of the deductions caused by ' jobbig off goods. Let us take a case in point. A manufactuer hard pushed for cash sels a parcel of goods at ' thirty off'-in other words, at 30 per cent. discount from the invoice value. Say the amount of the sale is 5001., the net proceeds just amount to 3501. Now, had that manufacturer taken a 500OI bill to his bankers, and paid 10 per cent. on four months' paper, the proceeds of the bill would be 4831. 6s. 8d. It is evident, then, that, hard as it is to pay 10 per cent. on the cashing of biLls, forced sales of goods are considerably worse; and ultimately the public must suffer if the jobbing system be continued to any great extent. On these points, then, the banks of this town have not beon most fortunate, and while their customers have not been permitted to run riot, as was the case with some of the manufacturers across the Channel, they have acted with the utmost liberality in all instances. It is certainly a source cf great satisfaction to tbe people of the north of Ireland that, at a time when, in far more higp-famed seats of commerce, distress and panic so large.ly preval, there should be such lsn1mle1ttconfad placed' in the strengtih and safety of the The same journal gives the following amonog other commercil rumours:- 0 " It was reported yesterday, and generally believed, that a house extensively engaged in the linen trade had suspended business in consequence of its connexion with houses in New York, which have been crushed in the commercial crash of that city. The liabilities are large, but it is said the assets vill also be large. t was rumoured further that parties in Belfast hed been advised by their friends in Scotland to refuse Scotch notes of every kind, in consequence of the uncertain state in which business and banks were now placed. Rumours of other failures nearer home were heard, but we dismiss these, believing them to be unfounded." A communication from Limerick, written last night, thus speaks of the effects of the pressure in that quarter :- "The Chamber of Commerce of this city has been numerously attended by members during the iast three days, anxiously perusing the inteligence 'turned in' every half-hour from the offlce of the Magnetic Telegraph. The uneasiness felt by the mercantile and commercial interests is unprecedented: and as each succeeding aunounceoent of extensive failures on the other side of the Channel is received great consternation prevails. The monetary panic has had its effect in this locality to only a trifling extent. In the first place it considerably reduced our market prices, especially for grain, butter, and pork. In grain a decline of 4s. per barrel has been experienced; butter, 6s. per cwt.; pitgs, 4. per owt. There has beens aelght run for gold upon all the local banks; but itis confined to the frightened portion of the farming classes, who until recently knew not what the possession of money was, but can now count it in hundreds. Intelligent and discerning persons have not had recourse to such an absurd movement. The increase of discount by the bailks here to 10 per cent, has not tended to either inconvenience or annoyance; on the contrary, more confidence is felt by men of business, who look upon the course ptusued not only as Justifiable and prudent, but also as well-timed, udicious, and indispensably necessary at this momerntous crisis; calculated as it must io to pprove beneficial and advantageous, insuring increased stabity and confidence in trade, while tending at the same time to the public THE LONDON COMPAXIMES n U5TE5lt. the Der-ry S&andurd, the old Presbyterian organ of Trenant Right, prefers the following indctuinent againlst the Worshipfull Clothwtorkers Comtpany of Lontdon, A satisfactory explanation on the part of the accused wvill nto doubt be forthcominlg at the proper time:- '-A public meeting of the tenantry on the Clothworkers' estate is to be held in Articlave, on Friday the 13th Inst., for the purpose of taking into consideration an eA:traordinary nLotice which the bailiff has been directed to serve upon them. This notice is, that if they durig the present month the rents now due, they be charged anadvanced rent of 5 per cent., andi if pay, ment be delayed till next month an extra charge of 10 per cent. will be made. A proceeding more monstrous than this it is hardly possible to imagine. In cOnseauence of the monetary convulsion that is now agita- ting the British empire agricaltural prodace cannot bedisposed of except at ruinouely low prices, and the slection of such a time s this for an arbitrary nandate of the nature described is .nough to excite universal indignation. ,es5des, it is not long since a new valuation of the company d estates was made, Pad the rents were then adjusted to the iir%A-oved st',-dPar, Fo tthat the late proceeding is without any reasonable e v se.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE 2'IMES.

THE Soairy oF ARTs.-In consequence of differences of opinion existing betveen the councU of the Society of Arts and their ohairman, Dr. Booth, which precluded the hope of his delivering the opening address at the commencement of the approaching session, in accordance with their opinions, the council have fortally requested that gentlemnm to resign the chair. It had previously been suggested to Dr. Booth in a friendly way, by several members of the council, that, in consideration of that want of unanimity, it was dedrable that he should retire from the chairmanship, but that he declined to do; and the result is that a requition in writing to resiga his ofrice, bearing the names of Mr. Harry Chester, Mr oenry Cole, ted several other members of the council, has been addressed to him, with which he has complied, feeling, on further reflocton, that It was abrolutely essential to the welfare and progress of the society that a coincidence of opinion should exist between the council and their official organ. The immediate cause of this step on the part of the council was a notice given by Dr. Booth last month that at the next meeting of councZ he should move that the subscriptions received from the mechanics' and other institutions in union with the society be set apart from the ordinuary income of the society, and that out of such subscriptions-amounting, it is said, to between 7001. and SOOI. a-year--all the necessary expenses incurred in the management of the examinations, or other measures for the benefit of the mechanics' iastitutions, should be defrayed, When Dr. Booth proceeded to bring forward that motion at a special meeting of the counctl, summoned at his own request, he was met in ILminc with an objection, taken by one of the members, that what he proposed to do was illegal, as his resolution contemplated a control over the funds of the society other than that of the council-a measure which, it was contended, was opposed to the spirit of the society's charter, and could not thereforebe entertained. He refused to accept that view of the case, and a resolhtion was thereupon moved and carried that his motion could not be put from the chair for the reason mentionedL. Binoe the roedgnation of Dr. Booth the council have again met, and after carefully considering the subject passed an unanimous resolution that the constitution of the Board of Examiners, of which Dr. Booth was also chairman, erabodied in con. nexion with the society a few years ago, for conducting the examinations of candidates for the society's certificates and prizes coming from mechanics' institntes, is illegal, as being at variance with the soCety's charter; and they have, as the only alternative left them, altogether suspended the existence of the board until its constitution and the bylaws affecting It can be brought, by a general meeting of the society, into conformity with the charter. The council have intimated that they wll take withont delay the stes necessary for this purpose. At a recent meeting of the rd of Examiners Dr. Booth characterized this as "an arbl'rary proceeding" on the part of the council, and complaineTdof the board having been "unceremoniously, ungracously, and abruptly dismissed;" and there the matter rests for the present. THE SUPPOSED MI1PDER A2ND MUTILATION i FRA2Nc&-The Monicur du Loira gives the following detaUs of the discovery of a human body at the railway station at Choisy-le-Roy :-" The cask containing the body was found about two months ago standing among packages which had come by a goods train from Paris, bet was not inserted in the waybIL As it was, hovever, directed to a person at Choisy, it was on the foUowing day sent by one of the porters, as directed, but It was brought back again by him in oonsequence of no such name being knownx in the place, and it was then stored away in the warehou:e. There it lay for several weeks, and as no one came to claim it the stationmaster, havinthis suspicions arousod perhaps by the accounts which he had read in the papers about the Waterloo-bridge tragedy, resolved to open the cask and ascertain its contents After knocking in one of the heads an envelope of oilloth was seen, and on this being removed the next thingwhich came to view was a quantity of ha7. Into this he plunged his hand, but withdrew it again in horror, from its coming ia contact with something like flesh, and of deathlike coldness. On the hay being removed the half putrefied body of a woman was discovered. The afterexamination testified to a dreadul atrocity in the oomrmssion of the crime. The head had been cut off and was wanting. The legs had been bent up towards the sides so as to make the body fit into the cssk; and, in order to shorten them, the feet had beon also removed. In order to lessen the emanations which would naturally proceed from the body the entrails had been taken out through two orifices, one on either side of the abdomen, and in order as It were to reduce the size the hands were forced into the orifices on either side, as if into pockets. As the station is close to the river it is snpposed the ca sk must have been brought In the night and placed where it was found so that a supposition might be entertained that the crime had been oommitted at Pari The fact of no emanxtions proceeding from the cask is explained by the manner in which the body was envelopedfin a thick layer of hay, and afterwards covered :over with oilcoth." Another paper asserts that the body was nothing but a mummy, and mnst have been that of a person dead at least 50 years ago. IDLAw PAm2rNQ g.-A very interesting collection Eaintings, recently brought from India by Mr. G. P. te, E.Z, is now on view in the shop of Mr. Boore, silversmith, Strand.

Under these circumstaoe she presIeted hersel at the bedroom window lookng to the north, attired in her nlghtdress only, and had the courage to desacnd from tai window to the plecting top of an oriel window below of the third so The fiames bunrting throughd the winou she ha tan1e, some doubt of her utite eae was entertained for a time, but the house sewarhd, rememtbering tbat a lader was near the Hall, it was sent for and reared up agaitst the wailL It was parocely long enog h to reach the bottom of the oriel window Of theth story, but acn i i atelydne Itthrew a rope r, to neendof which she seuredncths window-frame, and by means of this rope she lowered herself sfely down to the ladder and escaped without in jury. MosA of the female domestics escaped without Any, clothng beyond their night dresses. As from the torrents. of water penetrting toh lower rooms the Hal had now, become no longer tenantable, the Earl and Countees of ha esmnere, who d splayed great cacmn ieand self-possesson throughout directed the reoocupatioa of the old Hall-a mansion situated at only afew hundred yards distance, and thither most of the femnale, poetionmoathe hiousehold retired. Whnu the flames had beenftire guisbeaet twas found that four of the bedroom attics had be en entirely destroyed, but oul3e in one place had the fire broken through the floor below, and there not sufficiently to do much damage. The damage by water, ito fact, will probably be greter thani that from the 111ames6 The closet whece the fire commenced is immnediately over the great staircase, and consequently the principal rooms of the house lying contiguous to these stairs have been drence with tons weight of water. The bdroom l of the th atory, the sleeping and other rooms on the secondl floor, occupied by Her Majesty and the Prince Consort, on their recent -visit toWorsley, and magnificently furnished, together with the drawing and diniing room under them, on the first floor, have suffered severely, especially so far as the cornices, mouldinga of the ceiligs, and other decorations are concerned. The entire damage done by the fire will probabl reach 3,000l. to 4,0001., but it is difficult at present to formi an estimate of it. The building is insured . The cause of the fire is a perfect mystery, for the hot water was conveyed. to the closet-cistern by means of copper pipes, and it cam harlytbe supposed that they would ever he hot enough to intthe woodwork it camej in contact with.

THE EARL OF CARDrGA1 T. LAWBIE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I must say a few words in correction of part of your article in to-day's paper. You say, " Lord Cardigan's law. yer, before the first trial, wrote to a certain Mr. HRary i for some private letters of Major Lawre, with a view to their use at that triaL" lNow, the facts are that Mr. Hayward, who had been agent of pert of the estates a' the same time as Major Lawrde, was dead, and I wrote to his widow for any letters which had passed between Major Lawrie and' her late husband beaing on the affairs of the agency; but when she attended at my chambers with them I begged her to retain every one whch she considered private or confidential, and she did so acoordingly and although in the first instance, she had offered that f should read them and judge for myself, I distinctly refused to do so. This was stated in court on the Uth inst., and fuly admitted by Major Lawrie's counsel; and Vice-Chancellor Wood rew marked that it was evilent that Major Lawrie had acted under a false impression with respect to this point, and had been totally misinformed when he supposed that there had been any intention, either on the part of the Earl of Cardigan or any of his advisers, to put in evidence, or even to look at, any letter of 3iajer Lawre's which was of a private or confidential character. Trusting to your sense of jusicoe to insert this correction, I am, Sir, your obedient eervant. _RICHARD MILLS. Gray's-inn, Nov. 13. . b ,, , uLaroUgn TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM.E. Sir,-In your leading article of this day on the case oE "Lord Cardigan v. Lawrle" there are some statements which are calculated to convey to persons who have not read in e:zUn" ur report of the judgment of the ViCeChanee'ilor wood an erroneous impression prejudicial to our client, Major Lasvrle. They may be shortly corrected as follows:-Major Lawrie's "threat"'before the trial of the first action was, not to publish Lord Cardigan's Crimean letters, but, in case of his (Major Lawrie's) private letters being used on the trial of the first action, to produce on the same trial, and on all otber occasions when he should see fit, the letters In question, after he should have askied the officers alluded to in the letters whether they objected to such productionletters which, be it observed, although private and confidential, contained matters relating to hIajor Lawrie's management of Lord Cardigan's estates, and wourld have been of use to Major Lawrie on the trial of that action, but which, from a sense of honour, Major Lawrie had intended to withhold even to his own prejudice. Major Lawrie di4 not consult the officers reflected npon. The "thrt" was, as you correctly state, on explanation, immediately withdrawn, it was never acted upon, andit was never repeated. On thce contrary, it vwas a staterment recently made, withoult explanation of the circumstances, by Lord Cardigan to a brother officer, that Major Lawrie had threatened to publish his private letters, which led to Mlajor Lwrie's recent-not threat to publish the CrLmean correspondence (hich would have bee n committing the very offence the intention of' com itting which he so In. dlgnantly repudiated) but-announLcemoent of his intention to publish, in his own vindication, "the correspondence on whEich the accusation could alone rest"-vi., the letters containing the original "threat" and its withdrawalletters Which, as the VIce-Chancellor distinctly stated, Major Lawrie had a perfect right to publish. Lord Cardi. gan's injunction was not, as you state, obtained last term in. court, but in vacation, in private and ex parta. hXajor lAwrie had no opportunity until the presen term ot explaining the true facts of the case publicly in court. It is true that Lord Cardigan and his legal advisers app to have fallen into the niistal-e of supposing that the last sqnnoace nent was a threat to publish the Crimean correspondence, and it was so represented in Lord Cardigan's bil and in the affidavit on which the injunction was granted. But wrhenL the letter itself w.as prodcoed to the uourt7 and the circumstances to which it referred were explained, the Vice-Chancellor was perfectly satisfied that no such threat had been made, and on that ground he dissolved the injunnction. We are. Sir, your obedrent ar,arnt AILK15X AND HORN. 7- St- AfAAAW-l- Tzafalgar-squaro, Solidtors for Major Lawrije.
