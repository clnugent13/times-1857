GREAT NORTHERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company wa held yeaer. day at the London Tavern, Mr. B. Denison, P., in the
Yr. owatt, the seeetary, read the notioe conyening the i meeting.
The C ktPRXAxsaid it was customary at suchmneetings to affix the seal of the company to the regixtry of sharoholders, and it wa necessary to go through the form In ac cordanoe with the Act of Parliament It showed that the amount of consolidated sock, as it appeared in the books of the oompany on the 31st of Deoember last, amounted to 8,412,880l, and that there were 6,163 shareholders. The amount of stock issued-namely, 841%2,M80-was also 217,0001. in excess of what it ought to be, and the number of shareholders was six in exces. He proposed to affix the seal to the register.
A discusion tben enued, in which Mr. Knight, Mr. Hughes, Mr. J. Wilson, Mr. Waters, and other hareholders took part, in the course of which it was stated that affxxing the sel wouldnot bind them to anything, that it was merely a ministerial act, and could be affixed by the chairman without the authoritY of the meeting.
Mr. LoYD, the legal adviser, recommended that the seal sbould be affixed to the register as a protection tothe parties who had a right to the stock.
It was then agreed that the shareholders should neither assent nor dissent, but leave the matter in the hands of the chairman, who accordingly performed his duty by affixing the veal to the register of shareholders
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in Thc Tima, was taken as read.
The CnAiscAie said he had never met them, he was rsoW to say, under mnore unavourable eircumxnces since the (ormation of the~ Great NXorthern Comra. Wibnth
.pn.Wtithe lat six months frauds and forgeries bid cometolight which were enough to alarm the h lders of stock, and also more than enough to axlrm and mortify the directors. The investgations that had taken place were more than enough to exhaust the energies and ability of the clerks in the office, for he was bound to say that the whole of them had worked till 11 and 12 o'clock at night most willingly. As far ss the directors could at present juadge, the oompny had been robbed by Leoolad Redpath to the extent of 2200001L and, although the judges before whom he was tried haQ passed a most severe sentenoe upon him, it was no gratification to the shareholders The sentence was transportation for life. Deeply did he grieve that so grave an offence should have been committed, and that sugch enormous frauds should hAve been added to the numerous frauds which had arisen lately from speculation on a large scale. It wass melancholy thing that specxlation should lead men into such crimes and to ultimate punishment. He honad thA mAt;n,f-
wouni DO enabled to go through the ordinary business before they went into a discussion of the frauds. He would ask them to go through the accounts in the first instance, and, irrespective of the question to which he had alluded, the condition of the raillway was very satisfactory. They were told in the report that if tho dividend earned dtring the past half-year were added to that of the preceding hal-year it would amount to 5 per cent. for the year 1856. While in addition to that, the traffic on the line went on increasing, and were it not for those frauds, and he trusted the like would never occur aain, it showed the value and rogressive prosperity of the railway. He would say that fhey must not look behind them, but forward with confidence of success. Their property in the railway was placed on a safe and sound foundation, and was entitled to stand as a firstclams investment on the Stock-Exchange. The traffic receipts on the line amountodinthe year 1853 to 868,8991., in 1854 to 1 050 070l. in 185I to 1,137,6121., and in 1856 to 1,218,1771., alowng an increase in the receipts of 349,0001., or above 40 per cent., in four years. He thought that was a most satisfactory state of things, and far more than many of the shareholders present ever expectod in so short a time. With regard to Mr. Gladstone's award, mentioned in the report, it had not yet been received, and he could Fay nothing about it. The next matterrelated totheDoncasterandWakefield line, which would come before them at another time. The reception of the report would hind them to nothing. Should the Damfries and PortpatrickBillproceed, the consentof the shareholders would be asked to a permissive clause allowing the Great Northern to subscribe 160,OOOL towards the underta3dug. He was of opinion that if the railway from Damfries to Portpatrick were sanctioned, and that they would make certain agreements with the Great Northern it would be wise to render the proposed assistance. If he were to retain his present position he would take care to get an ample return. They would not by any means be bound by letting that part of the report pass. He then concluded by moving the reception of the report and accounts.
Mr. HL PACKX, deputy-chairman, seconded the motion.
Dr. Ruaw said they were told at the last meeting that from the engineer-in-chief down to the stoker and the secretary to the porter they had not a dishonest man in their employment, and, considering what had occurred, he would ask them how they could rely upon such statements. He contended that the directors should be made responsible for the frauds that had been committed. (Cries of " Down, down," and uproar.)
Mr. HvGusn said they were driven by necessity to give validity to those forged and fraudulent shares. He thought they should investigate this fresh iUustration of railway mlsmansaement; it was quite apparent that the directors and auditors had been informed, by the state of the accounts, that they were not correct, although they had been signed by the chairman and voubced by the two auditors. He thought that tho directors and auditors should be held personally esponsible, and he would move a resolution to teateffect. thought that MIr. Clark's statement, inreplytothe aUegations ofthedirectors,showed thathewas free from all blame. Heconsidered thatthe directors and auditors had been negligent, and that the latterhadbeenenthusiastic in praise of the accountant. He concluded 'y moving an amendment to the effect that the directors had not taken proper precautions to aocure the property of the shareholders, and that they should be made personaUy responsible for what had taken place.
Dr. BILEY seconded the amendment.
Mr. 3MORGAN said there was a net balance of 243,9231., ana it appeared to him that, as they had divided in December, 1855, a surplus of 3,2401. more than they ought, they could not inur much risk in dealing with the sum they had now in hand. He had been an original shareholder, and had held his stock from the commencement. He contended that those frauds should not be capitalized, but paid for out of revenue; it was evidently a revenue charge, and the had high legal opinion to tha6t effect. It was, as they
reat loss arising fom the fai of a viaduct or a tunnel and should be provided for out of revenue. He proposd that they should set aside 15,000L every half-;ear, ana that Redpath's frauds would by that means be paid off in about five years. He then moved a resolution to that effect.
Mr. ilALuS seconded the motion. He thought that by the adoption of such a course much trouble and litigation would be avoided. They should consider the various propositions with great patience in order to arrive at some practical result. Some lad propcsed to pay off the whole at once out of the present revenue; that course might suit the rich, bat there were many poor persons who would feel the loss of the dividend. Re was of opinion they might pay the whole of the logs out of traffic by means of a small increase in the charge. There was the coal traffic which he believed was by no means remunerative, although the receipts amounted to159,ODOl. He then went into a calculation to show that the expenses in every way, including interest on rolling stock, amounted to 1.D3,0 vu respect of the coal traffic, lesving only about 29,0001 profit. The small item ofreasefor the wheels of the coal trucks amounted to4,0001., and he believed, on the whole, considering the wear and tear of the permanent way. that inwtead of a profit Thess were probably losing by it. H^e thought they should look into this traffic,andseewhetheraprofitora l6sswas derived from it. He had no doubt that the directors believed the coal traffic was remunerative, but he wished to ;^,ress the subject on their attention, and to have it properly fivestigated.
Professor Eloppus could not understand how the directors could have been duped so long as eight years by those frauds. He thougbt there must be something wrong in the constitution of the board, and that a few well paid directors who should be held responsible for their management would bave discovered those frauds at a much earher period, and have managed the affairs of the company much better.
Mr. G LsuR proposed that a committee be appointed to investigate the accounts and square up everything to the present time. There were many points of which they knew nothing. He wished to know howF much they gained or lostly the East Linconshire, how the coal traffic sto^, what they erer doing with the ARoyston and Hitchin and the mneergate. If they appointed a committee who would look into matters at men of business he thought some good
The Rev. HL SIBTIIORP advised them, whatever they did, not to go to law but to settlo the loss as soon as possiblo by paying it off out of the money in hand.
The CRIAnL x was not at all surprised to hear some of the observations that had been made, but he was not rrepared to admit what Mr. Hughes had stated, that theyha
neglected their duty to the shareholders, and he had no intention whatever of undertaing personal responsibility for the loss they had sustained. Be bad done everything he could, and his colleagnes had done the same, to promote their interests and to protect their property. He wisbed that Mr. Clark, their former reg&trar, was present, in order that he might go into the matter and set Mr. Hughes right as to how far he was justified in defending Mr. Clark, who waa appointed to the responsible situation of registrar at 6001. a-year. That gentleman was better paid than any other officer of the company, and spent ferver hours in the offoeo; his duty was to examine transfers, sollers' stock account, and see that they were properly signed. He had nothing else to do. He (the chairman) could produce 50 clerks in their employ who would have done it much better. It was meroly a mechanical and ministerial business. He would show them a transfer that took
lace d rig the time he was in their service that bore upon to face of it tbo most unmistakable signs of forgery. The fact was that Leopold Radpath had forged three of the eignaturas, and if he had examined those transfers he would have seeL what theywere, and the frauds would have been prevented; but he had never looked at them at all. It was the duty of the registrar to see they were right. Who was to be responsible if the registrar was nott Corld it be expected that the directors should from
UAY 10 Gayanc Week to week see that those things weredone when they paid a gentleman 6001 a-year for doing the work?. HedM not see bow the directors could"be blamed for that, or held personally responsible for theneglect of the registra. There were many mercantile men present who, no doubt, bemtelyd confidential clarlks foi the aimple reason that they ould not do the work themselves. In every lbrge establishnment there were men trusted to a considerable extent, snd ke contended, as tated in the report, that if Mr. Clark had done his duty the frauds would have been diseovered. Redeath had continued his courme with impunity, because he ha a dupe for a superior.
After considerable noiso ana confusion the anenaiment of M[r. Hughes was put nan rejected by a large majority.
M1r. BM.nIMG proposd an amendment, that the charge. for religious instraction merged, in the general aoconntse eWahcr
va 4, ow of lumas this was rojechd by a large maority,
and the resolution for theroeputonof te report c*ar2 vtnEtnuolmOuy. -
The CHXRrWr then explafned that there was . balance of 2439001 of met refohte to be disoed of, and they were advised by the Attorney-General t nt under e3B cir
cmtanoes they could not make a dividene legally wioatan Act of Parliament. He thouht to follow up that opWLonj by brgng in a Bill, and obtaning the spension of the standing orders, but the approsehinf disolution of Parliamnent rendered that conrse unmvalab at present, andtberefore ieb noill thento submit. Heooncluded bymosing a rsolution that no diyidend be declar, and the directorg be requestdd to apply for an Act of PArli'ment as oon oa. posm e.
Mr. PACL seconded the motion.
A long diwsion ensed, in vhich Mr. Morgan, MrZ Hghes, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Denison, Q.C., took pert,
in the couse of which an amendment by Mr. Huhe . seconded by Dr. Fumy. va rejected by a largem;jority
An amenament, propowed b Mr. NichoCon, seconded by Mr. Fenton, ws amendd and eonverted, at the auggestion of tho chairman, into a substantive motion,to tlb effect that no dividend be declaed, but that the balance of, 243,9231. be applied to meet the losses caused by the frauds and forgeries or Loopold Redpath, In such manner as the directors may oonulder mest conducivo to the interetts o-
the compeny requemting and authorizing the directors to' apply to Pariaient for a Bill and take such steps in respect thereof as they may deem advisable,
Several shareholders expressed themr.lves in favour of paying the losse out of revenue, and it ws believed that that course would be approved by Parliament.
The motion was then put and carried.
Mr. GntaR propoed tht a committeo of shareholders, not being directors, be appointed to examine the accouqt
nd aSffis of the company, an report the rsult toa pecil ineetin.
Mr. WATERS thought the operation of such a committea would be to retore confidence in the undertaking.
Mr. J. FOSTm protested against the course adopted by the Chairman with respoct to Mr, Clark, the former registrar of tho oompany, and requested the shareholders. to suspend their judgment with respect to him nntil they had well considered his reply to the stateinent of the directorls
Tne CAIMUN said he had no wish to renew the subject,
but felt compeled to do so in eonsequenoe of the inter-' pition Of Yr Foster, whoec father ws ihe frien of Mr.,
6ark,aid,ad insited on 1s it provided for at 600r.. *-year by the Great Northern Company, under an arrangement with the Direct Northern -Comany, of whicli'he ws FeCretary. He then went more parti rry into tho tubject,
andentered into various details with a view to strengthenhe observations alread made by the directors in their, report with respect to th ay in which the business of the transfer department had been attended to both by Mr. Clark and Mr. Bedpath.
A long discussion ensued on this queston, in the course of which it appeared that even the present systemi in the transfer deprtment was far from perfecL A legia opinion. was read wth a view to show that the requirements of the Act of Parliament were compled with by intustinmg a stereotyped signaturo of the xecretary, " J. R. Mowatt," to the custody of Yr. Clark, and afterwards of Redpath, as regitrar.
The CanLuX then adverted to the subject before the. meeting, and stated that he had no objection to the appointxnent of a committee provided its objecta defined, and
the names of the members of it werostated. He had no ob-: jection to an impartial committee, and, followlng the rulea of the House of Commons, members at both sides should be placed on the oomnittee. In that case it should consist of directors and shareholders. He had no idea of appointing a committee with a roving commistion.
Mr. GIESLXR had no objection to have one-third direc. tors and two-thirds shareholders.
It was eventually agreed that the business of the com.
mittee should consist of examining the ccounts and theregistration dopartment, the comrittee to consist of fourshareholders and two directors.
The CnAr.AN took that opportunity of stating his.e opion wth reard to the constitution of boards of directon. Re considered that all boards of direction should be very much reduced in number and much better paid, for in a large body what was everybody's business was nobody's
business. He woula naLme a board of five members, andwould bring down all boards to the position of oommis. tioners, pay them well for their labour, and place all the responsiblUity upon them, by that means they would be able to avoid such fellows as Iedpath.
A committee, consisting of hr. Giesler, Mr. Waters, Mr.. Nicholson, and Mr Malins and two directors to be named by the chairman, was appointed to investigate the accounts. and registration department, and to report thereon as soon as possible.
1'he retiring directors Mr. Packe, Mr. Arbouin, and Mr.
Parker were unanimously re-elected, and Mr. A. Paul was. elected a director to flU a vcancy at the board.
The proceedings concluded with a yote of thanks to the chairman and directors.

UNITED STATES.
Tle Earl of ELGIN gave notice that on Tuesday next, in sooving for certain papers, he would call the attention of sta House to our relations with the United States.
SUCCESSION DUTY RETURN.
Lord MONTEAGL,E said, that the succession duty had been -aleulated to produce a considerable sum by this pzriod, and yet it had been stated on very good authority that it had produced only about one-third of the sum calcalated upon. Nevertheless, a return on their lordships' able represented that no separate account of the produce ofthe succession duty wvas kept, though statements had been madein Parlament onathe sapposed amount of the apecession duty. Ho should call the attention of the Go. versment to this subject at a futare sitting of the House.
THE COMING ELECTION.
The Earl of DERBY gave notice that on the second reading of the Income-tax BiU, which might be taken as a
iotiLo of the approaching dissolution of Parliament, he should trouble their lordships with a few observations on the cirecmstances under which an appeal was now aboat to jbi made to the country.
CEaNA.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said, he intended to xaove for cortaia returns respecting the execation by British authorities in China of the supplemental treaty of 1843. It appeared to himn that, when they -were very strict with the Ch7iese Government as to the execution of treaty obligalions, it behoved the British authorities to be sure that they were strictly correct in the performance of their obligations. Those obligstions were imposed with the view of preventing Illicit trade. There were three articles which bore on the subject. The first was the 12th, audit commenced with the expression of a hope that, inasmuch as a tariff fair and regular had been established, smuggling would entirely cease. .Tow, as regarded the articles to which that tariff referred, it 'a reasonable to expect that when a fair and regular tariff ws established smuggling should cease, inasmuohas the only mode to put an end to it was by the establishment of a fair and reasonable sale of duty. But it did not appear extremely reasonable that smuggling generaUly should cease, that is, on articles which still remained under prohibition 'without the imposition of a fair duty; and that hope must have referred to the expectation that in thecourse of negotiations some duty would be imposed on opium, as was at one time considered probable. The article, however, apeared to have been agreed on in the terms he bad mentiored. The article went on to say that the plenipotentiary ihould instruct the consuls strictly to watch and carefully to scrutinize the conduct of every British subjecb trading umder their superintendance; and that those consuls should instantly apprise the Chinese authorities of any potitive instances of smuggling coming to their knowledge, Now, he thought it desirable to know whether in point of fact the coDsuls had scrutinized the conduct of persons shading under their superintendence, and whether there had been cases in which they had apprised the Chinese authorities of positive instanoes of smuggling. The 14th article providedthat an officer should be appointed at Hong. kong to examine the registers and passes of Chinese vessels, and not to allow any without passes to trade, and to report the circumstances to the Chinese authorities. It was clear with what object this provision was agreed to by the Chinese Government, for it was stated at the conclusion of the article that, by that agreement, it was hoped that piracy and iUegal traffic vould be prevented. Therefore it was essential to be ascertainEd whether the British authorities had performed the obligations imposed by that article. There was a farther article, the 16th, and under that the Customs' officers in the five ports were to make a monthly return of the passes granted to trade at Hongkong, and to communicate once a- inonth to the proper officer, who was to make a similar return to Canton of the Chinesevessels trading to and from Hongkosng, and the Chinese authorities were to apprise the authorities at the five ports in order that by these arrangexnent3 and precautions all clandestine and illegal trade under tbe cover of passes might be prevented. It was therefore desirable to be ascertained whether, under this article the British officer at Hongkong had performed the duty impoeed by it. (Hear, hear.) The object of the article was to prevent all illicit trade under the cover of passes. Sir J. Bowring, in writing to the Government at home, directed attention to some observations submitted to him by the colonial treasurer, which, he stated, appeared wel worthy of attention; fi r while, on the one hand, it was desirable that the privilege of hoisting the British flag should not be conceded without proper security, it was also desirable that the Chinese settled in the colony should be able to appreciate the advantage of their position in possessing the substantial benefits it conferred. The colon ltreasurer stated that if anything had been or would be pre-emi. nentIy beneficial, it was that very system of granting colonial register, particularly to respectable Chinese settlers and persons entitled to hold the registers, since it had already added to and stil tended to increase the coastJagtrade in British and Indian goods and produce, such as cotton, opium, &c. Now, these passess were to be granted at the five ports to Chinese vessels, and were to be investi-
ated by sBritish authorities for the purpose of preventing llicit traffic; but, as appeared from the report of the colonial treasurer, these registers had for thesr effect the encouragement of the illicit trade in opium. (Hear, hear.) And opium was not to be treated as merely one amOnR other articles. I- R as the great article of trade. It was zhough the enormous increase in the trade of opiunm that the British were able to draw such greatly inereasedexports from China. Ee did not wish his motion to extend over more than five er six years, but this he would leave to the convenience of the noble ea-l. It seemed that their lordships were not to have many opp )rtnnities of expressing their opinions before the " final diss lution" of Parhiament, and he wished, there. fore, to say a few words with respect to the expedition which it was the intention of the Government to send to China. As far as he could gather from the newspapers, that expedition was to consist of some heavy vessels of war, four regiments of infantry, and four batteries of artillery. When the noble earl (Clarendon) received on the 3d of January despatches from SirJ. Bowring, giving an account of the entry of the British troops into Canton, the visit to Commissioner Yeh's house, the destruction of the Bogue Ports, of the public and private junks, and the shelling of Canton, the noble earl must have been satisfied that there existed a state of war between this country and the authorities and people of Canton. The noble earl must have known that Sir J. Bowring had advanoed claims under the supplementary treaty of 1843 to which the strongest reaistance would be offered by the Chinese, and he could not have supposed that any means at the disposal of Sir J. 33owring could compel the Chinese to concede those points, We were, then, clearly at the commencement of a serious tonrlict, and it was by the mail of the 10th of January, and niot by the mail of the 10th of March, that the intentions of the Government ought to have been communicated to India, and tbe requisite preparations made for an adequate
aval force to support the force to be sent from this country. In military operations time was of the greatest importance. If preparations had been made on the receipt of these deSpatChe-, and if by the 10th of January orders had hieen sent to India for the preparation of an adequate force for the support of troops sent from this country, it might have been posuble, by great exertions in India and in this country, to place that lorce in Singapore by the second week in April, which would be a favourable season for operations, But if orders to this effect were only sent out by the mail of the 10th of March he regretted to inform the Government that their orders would be of no avaiL There would be no vessels at Madras wlhen the despatches arrived, and very few at Calcutta, as they would have sailed for their destinations. There would be no means of conveying troops to the extent required, for little less than 20,000 tons of shipping would ,be wanted. The vessels sent would meet the monsoon in the bay of Bengal, and would arrive in a scattered atate, Let their lordships consider the danger to the British population, British property and character at Hongkong in the midst of that great Chinese population, and the encouragement given to the Chinese by any delay in brin forwari that boasted power of England on
we had rather tio much relied. He was afraid that the troops would now arrive at the most unhealthy peried of the year, and that the sickness which vas so fatal to the army and, in a less degree, to the navy in the late war, would be again fatal to our forces. He did not know whether the information glven in the newspapers was to be relied on but he trusted that the Government -would not send on hcard the vessels about to embark for India more troops than they ought to carry, considering the climate and the length of the voyage. He recollected some troops coming out by the Blenheim and the Apollo, who tore the voyage tolerably well, but on their arrival the 98th Me 'ament fell to pieces and was not efficient for service; rnd this would be the case with any detachments who were a long time at sea in a orowded vessel. The troops would pass the Cape in the middle of winter. They might be dezained on their voyage, and the date of their arrival would certainly be'exposed to great risk. He would recommend the Government to supply these vessels now going to the Chinese seas in the hottest months of the year with awnings; not, however, the aingle awnings ordinarily furnished, which kept out neither sun nor rait, but double
awnings, running from stem to stern, and sufficiently thick to keep out both sun and rain and to enable the rain to be collected when It fell. There was also a great want of ventilation between decks in such vessels, and if the Government wished the troops to arrive in an efficient state the means snggested byreason and experience for seeuing the ventilation of troopships ought to be adonted In the present state of feeling i China it was quite idle to expect, unless, perhaps, in a few of the islands, that the troops would be able to obtain fresh meat, for want of which their health would be most seriously affected. He would, therefore, strongly recommend that some means should be adopted not merely for providing preerved meat by contract. but for testin its quslity, He emembered that even on the banks of the, iver Plate it ws ixpoasible to obtain fresh meat when the natives were unfriendly, even when thwaowete droves of tattle aroundl. In such a case preserved 3meat. Might be furnihshd -with great advantage. He had
oeoisidered wito disntya the probbility that the operations in China woul be carried on b Eupean troop without the foratano of native troops, ceause it wa necelary Ina fnfc ib climate And at such a shon of the year that duties under-the sun should be 4lseharged by native troops.

ever. The ships could not get within reach of the enemy, and the troops would have to be immediately tran,sferred to sWmaller vesieCs or put on ihore without anything to cover them. The Minister of War, he thought, would acquire some useful nformatiom if hewouldtk te trouble to read the orders sent out and the dei.patchese xent to Englhud during the last Chinese war. All the despatches from Lug. land of which he ha cognizance -were written with the approbation of the late Du e of Wellington and Sir Gcorge Cockburn, and he hold frequent communication with them as to the mode of conducting operations. At the earliest ossible period he gave directions for the preparation of folowers, for without 300 or 400 native followers to each regiment the troops would be useless. He was not recommending anything which he did not himself observe in conducting the last Chinese war. Followers for all the detachments were prepared, and everything was done which knowledge of India and Eastern service could suggest to make the force efficient. He thought that another matter of very great inportance was to take precaautions to prevent the action of fire vmessls gainst large ships in confined waters. He knew that in 1841 it was a Bubject of the greatest anxiety, and that the strongest precautions were taken which the exprience of Sir George Cockhurn could suggest. When heardof a revesselcoming underthe bows of one Her Majesty'sships he thought it absoltely necessary instructions should be given to the admiral and officers engaged in the service to take greater precautions than appeared to have been taken. It was not creditable that any fire vessel should have come into such close proximity to one of Her Majesty's ships. (Waar, hear.) It was with regret that he heard the noble lord at the head of the War Department attempt to defend the destruction of the suburbs of Canton, and at was with great satisfaction that, in looking over the par connected with the last war, he read a despatch from rd Palmerston, then Foreign Secretary, directing those who had the conduct of operations in no case to burn or destroy a town. It was to be a war against the Government-not a war against the people. (Iear, hear.) It was said to bo theintentionof the Government to send a force up the Yang-tse-kiang, and to do exactly what was done in 1842; but the circumstances were altogether altered. We were not at war with the Emperor of China, but with the people of Canton; and, further than that, Nankin was no longer in possession of the Emperor. If we took possession of it we added nothing to the embarrassments of the Chinese Government, but probably assisted the Emperor by turning oat the rebels. T erefore, in his opinion, nothing could be more contrary to reason than such an expedition. (Hear, hear.) Our operations, whatever they might be, should be confined to Canton, for with Canton oly at presentb hat we a cause of war. He heard with very great regret that there was an intention of sending out a great Plenipoten. tiary-some very important person in the confidence of the Government, who was to go with some person on the part of France, and some person, probably, on the part of the United States-to exact from the Chinese Government some concessions which we had no pretence for demanding. He objected to that, not only because it was most unworthy to take advantage of a supposed period of difficulty to require concessions from the Chinese .Govermeent for which there was no pretonce, but because he deprecated any conjoint operations and any conjoint negotiations. (Hear, hear.) We had had enough of both. ( ear hear.) We had seen the inconvenient manner in whica conjoint operations affected the character of our arms and the result of our negotiations, and he most earnestly trusted that, whatever the Government might determine on doing, they woulld do it by themselves; that they would exact only those terms to which they thought, as Englishmen, we were entitled, and that having obtained those terms they would retire from the conffict. (Cheers.) The noble earl concluded by moving for the following retunms:-
" Return of the number of cases in which the Consuls in China have, under the 12th article of the supplemental treaty of 1843, apprised the Chinese authorities of any
ositive instance of smuggling transactions coming to their
o wledge.
" Copy of any instruction to the Consuls in China, issued by the British Plenipotentiry under the said 12th article, directing them to strictly watch over and carefully scrutinize the conduct of aU persons being British subjects trading under their superintendence.
" Copies of any letters from the said Consuls reporiing the measures adopted by them for carrying out any such instructions.
" Copies of any reports made by any British officer at Hongkong, under the 14th article of the supplementary treaty, to the Chinese authorities of any Chinese vessels repairing to Hongkong to buy or sell goods without having a pass or register from one oft the five ports.
'"Copy of any return or communication made to the Chinese authorities at Canton, under the 16th article of the said supplementary treaty, showing the names of Chinese vessels arrived at Hongkong or departed kom thatport with the nature of their cargoes," frmtapo,
Lord PANMIURE said it was impossible to conceal tba, operations in China at this season of the year were matteri which must attract the most serious attention of Her Majesty's Government; but Her -Majesty's Government conceived that the state of affairs at Canton -was such that not only the honour of England, but the sa fety of British property and the support of British trade demanded that that state of affairs should be brough t to as speedy a conclusion as possible. He had no hesitation in saying that the policy of the Government was in the first instance to use every endeavour to bring those affairs to a satisfactory conclusion in a peaceful manner, and only to have recourse to force in the last resort. It was quite trua that It was the intention of Her MajesWs Government to send out an officer of high character and position, who could negotiate with Cbina for the renewal of those treaties already existing, but, he lamented to say, never duly observed. It would not be the object of Her Majesty's Government to extort from the Chinese Government, even if we had force enough to do it, any terms which were not just, fair, and reasonable, and such as the justice of the people of this country would approve. But should the Chinese Emperor refuse tograntto our envoy those just and reasonable demands, it was not only the opinion of the Government, buhe was certain it was the opinion of the country at large, that the honour and character of the British nation in that great empire demanded that we should not stop nuntil we had succeeded in obtaining them. (Hear, hear.) For that purpose it was intended to send immediately a force to China. The nuestion had been consideied whether that force should be sent from India or direct from this country. Under all the circumstances of the case it appeared to him to be more advisable to send troops from this country, and also more economical to operate from this country. They had at the present moment four regiments under orders for relieving and reinforcing the troops In India. Those regiments were completed to the full strength, and were now quite ready to saiL Byseuding those regiments to China, ifupon arriving there the state of affairs had improved, they would be sent on to their original destination, in which event the expense of their transport would faU upon the East India Company. If, however, circum. stances should render necessary the continuance of those troops in China, the expense of their conveyance thither must be borne by the mother country. He had the satisfaction of informing the noble earl that the transports which were to take out the troops had been measured, so that no more should be taken on board each ship than could be conveniently and safely accommodated, and every precaution had been taken to insure the comfort of the men, not only during the voyage but after their arrival, as the vessels would be used as barracks until the services of the troops were required on shore, so that the men would not be exposed to the ravages of disease by being quartered in Chinese villages or in tents on land. He also proposed to send out, to arrive long in advance of the troops, the head of the commissariat department, the head of the medical department, and the head of the store department, to make preparations and secure supplies, that the troops might be su plied with fresh meat, which was so absolutely necessay for their health. Orders had also been given to convey to China a sufficient quantity of salt provisions and preserved meats, of vegetables, flour biscuit, and everything necessary for the wellbeing of the troops. There certainly was no intention of directing any demonstration against either of the four friendly ports of China, with which we were not, as the noble earl had truly observed, in a state of war, and he hoped we never should be so. The whole quarrel was with the Cantonese, and none, he believed, were more anxious to see lowered the pride of the Cantonese than the inhabitants of those four ports who had hitherto been taunted by them with allowing barbarians to enter within their walls. With regard to what feU from him on a previous evening respecting the destruction of a suburb of Canton, he did not defend such an act in the abstract, but what he did say, and what he repeated, was that he felt tertain Admiral Seymour would not have resorted to such a step had it not been necessary for the defence of his position and the security of his fleet. With respect to any intended operations againat Canton, he was gur that to decide upon any fixedplanof operationsatatimewhenthe oonductofaff'airs was to be intrusted to an officer in whom all must feel confidence would be premature, if not a work of supererogation. No doubt when the commissioner arrived out he would survey the whole state of affairs, andAhis first act would of course be to endeavour to resume negotiations. If be failed in thoseo endeavours he would direct, with a view to bring the
Cantonese to reason, all those pr-oe-eedi-ng-s o'f a-r-wihic-h would be most likely to secure that end with the least pos-
sible amount of bloodshed-such as by cutting off the supplies of the city. To give any particular orders at this distance from the scene of operations, in ignorance of what might be the state of affairs upon the arrival of the commis.
soner in China, would be essentially wrong. All that the
Government _t home could do and would do was to make the force sent out as efficient as possible, and to take every precaution that could be adopted to maintain their health. with regard to the mode of dress and the protection of the men from the heat of the sun the noble lord might rest assured every precaution had been and would be taken. More could not be done, and they could only hope that those precautions would, under the Almighty Providence, be found effectnal in preserving the troops from the dangers attendant upon the climate.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH wished to know whether it was intended to carry on operations in China without the assistance of the native troops of India ? If that were so, we should certainly loso one-half our force and fail in our object,
Lord PANMURE said that, as at present advised, it was the intention of the Government to carry on operations without the aid of the pative troops of India. Considerable difficulty had been experienced upon a former occasion from
the admixture of forces. I pon the occasion of the lastwar in China the British and the native Indian troes were ike bnckets in a'well-wihen one was efficient the other was lieffcient, During the hot season the native Indian troops were able to do duty, *hile the British soldiers failed and
died; bot directly the cold weathersetin the Indian soldiers bcame, ntterly useless, while the English recovered their health. In his opinion, hoeveer, if we maintained the com nand' or the Canton river there -would n noie theysion tolaonpd te troo°psuntil the season 3u .hi9 thy clsl oprAt wih* ffiieny,st *which
time native Indians wo u retl Mei The noble earl had complained of the lrge size of the vesses inwhich the troops were to be sent out. It was necessary to send out large vessels, because they would be required iU China as barrack aommoda5ion and s a base of operations. Smaller vessels, however, would be on the spot, including 16 ganboats, drawing five or six feet water, and conntry vessels would be taken up, whicb, being towed by small steamers, would convey troops to any point where their presence was needed. With respect to the statement that the reinforcements were two months too late, al he (Lord Panmure) could say was, that immediately upon intelligence being received of the necessity for additional troops orders were given.
Earl GREY remarked that, as far as he could perceive, no orders were given for the dospatch of a large force t) Cbina from this country until after the arrival of the last mail, about a fortnight since.
Lord PANMURE.-One regiment sailed about a month &go.
Earl GREY repeated that the large expedition now preparing was not ordered until after the arsival of the last mail. Since that mail reached this country a noble admiral in that House had repeatedly asked for tho production of the despatches sent from China, which could scarcely be objectionable at this distance from the rcene of operations. Those despatohes, however, had not been produced, and therefore he (Earl Grey) wished to know whether any inteDigence had been received of so serious a character, of whichthe public had not been apprszed, as to lead the Government to believe that a considerable increase of our military forces in China was necessary ?
The Earl of CL &RBENDON said there was no objection whatever to the production of the despatches referred to by the noble earl. He had already stated oa a former night that by tho-e despatches the Government became for the first time acquainted with the fact that the admiral had found it necessary to withdraw from the positions he had held in the Canton river. That was the first intimation they had received that the admiral did not consider his positions teiablewith the force then at his disposal, having regard to the threatening aspect of affairs at Hongkong and the necessity for his stationing a portion of his force at that place. There was nothing in those despatches of which he (Earl Clarendon) had not already given a summary iri his reply to a question which had been put upon a previous evening, but at the same time there was no objection to produce the despatches if it were desired, He would take that opportunity of stating, in consequence of an observation which had faUen from the noble earl (the Earl of ElUenborough), that he had made inquiry at the Colonial-office, and that nothing was known there about any passe; which had been granted with reference to the fulfilment of the treaty. If the treaty had been carried out stictly according to its letter, whatever was done would be done by the harbonrme.sters of the different ports, and of course their proceedings would not have been made the subject of reference to this country. With regard to notices being given on the subject of smuggling transactions, he had heard from inquiry that the correspondence or ua derstanding between the Chinese Commissioner and the Britisa plenipotentiary on the conclusion of the treaty had never beea sent home; therefore at present there was no means of knowing what had led to that somewhat unusual article to which the noble earl had caUed attention, with respect to guarding against smuggling or to giving notice when smugglng transactions took place. There were three or four despatches which contained records of notices given to the Chinese authorities under the treaty; and he had been informed that iu 1851 instructions were sent sent out to Sir George Bonham with reference to the numerous notices which had been given by the British plenipotentiary and consul to the Chinese authorities about smuggling, of which no notice bad been taken by the Chinese authorities. There was, in fact, no doubt whatever that the smuggling took place with the connivanoe of the Chinese authorities. (Hear, hear.) There was not a siagle provision for giving notice in the case of transactions of this kind in the treaties concluded with France and the United States; consequently British subjects were really placed in a worse position than the citizens of France or the United States. He repeated, it was perfectly manifest that the smuggling was connived at and shared in by the Chinese authorities. (aear, hear.) The result was that his noble friend, who was then at the head of foreign affairs, sent out a long despatch reviewing all that had been done, stating the terms of the treaty, and adding that if the Chinese would not collect their own revenue and assist in carrying out the terms of the treaty it was impossible for this conntry to give effect to its provisions, seeing we had never had their co-operation in carrying it out. Notice was given to the Chinese authorities to that effect; but the Chinese Commissioner returned a very vagne answer, intimating that he was not aware that any smagghng had taken place. That was the position in which the matter had remained since 1851, and since 1851 there had been no despatches on the subect; but he (the Earl of Clarendon) would lay on the tabe the despatch to which he had alluded.
The motion was then agreed to.

THE BURGLARY AT ASHOVElM
Mrr. SPOCtNlR aisked the Secretary of State for the 'Home Department 'wheth'er it was not a factihat for some time befoire the recent notorioui btarglary at Ashover the Recorder of Birmingham-had sugge&Ae to him that, as the man who had, been committed for thAt burglaryhad nso ostensible means of living, and continuallyassciatod with thievesp, the ticiet of leave which he-lheld ouglbt t bewithdrawn? 4
Sir G. GRBY'vsaid, the facts were these :-In February, 1856, the Recoerder of -Birmnodghad ftantinitted to him a
report from the police of that borough relative to 16 persons who held tickets of leave there. 'From thet report it appeared that eight out of the 1S had con.- ructed themselves honestly and well. With regard to t*o others, tbeir characters were doubtful,althoughnothing was known abont theta which called for the revocation o; their tickets of leave. But as to the remaining eight the epo-rt stated in general terms that their conduct was bad. ge therefore desired inquiries to be made with regard to them, and it turned out that three of them had committed indictable offences. One of them had been convicted, and his ticket of leave was necessarily withdrawn according to the general rule, whilo two of them were sentencec to terms exceeding those to which they were originally sentenced, and their tickets of leave were of course revoked. That left five of the eight whose conduct was reported to be bad, and, with regard to those five, two of them had been cautioned by the police, and one of them consequently 'disappeared from Birraingham, but, as the other kept a res;cctable house, bis ticket of leave was not withdrawn. Wit regard to the remaining three, he (Sir G. Grey) directed the policc to warn them. The police thereupon informed them that if they did not discontinue their course of life their tickets of leave shonld be withdrawn. Hehad not received any further communication from the police with respect to those three. The Recorder of Birxmingham suggested that, notwithstandin- the suspicions against the eight out of the 18, it would be harsh to withdraw their tickets of leave without affording them an opportunity of showing that thes. suspicions were groundless, and he (Sir G. Grey) concurred in that suggeStion. The Recorder suggested that it would be desirabie to remove these persons from Birmingham. He (Sir G. Grey) desired the police to communicate with them, and inform them that they were being observed, and that in the event of their continuing a dishonest course of life measures would-be taken for the withdrawal of their tickets of leave. He imagined that, with regard to this man, the obiect which the Becorder had in view ws attained, and he had left Birminghar because the place at which he had committed the crime was in another part of the cotmtryat Ashover, in Derbyshire.
MILITARY PRISON.
Mr. COGAN asked the hon. gentleman the Under-Secretary for War whether there was any intention to establish a military prson in connexion with the camp at the Carragh, and, if so, whether any steps had been taken as yet with respect to it ?
Mr. F. PEEL replied that two propositions had been made for the establishment of a military prison, one for the purchase of an existing civil prison, and the other for the erection of anew prison within thelimits of the camo of the Cmrragh. No decision had yet been come to upon those propositions.
THE JUDGES IN MALTA.
Mr. KINNATRD asked the right hon. gentlemaan the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he had taken any steps to event judges holding the office of member of Couneil at zllta?
Mr. LABOUCEERE said that he had thought it expedient to recommend that an order in Council should be passed by which it should be provided that in future judges of the superior courts in alta should not bo eligible Jor seats in the Council of Government.
THE SITE OF S3iITHMELD MARKET.
Lord R. GROSVENOR asked the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government was prepared to give effect to the recommendation of the Smithfield Committee-viz7, "That the best appropriation for the general benefit of so much of the site of Smithfield as reverts to the Crown would be to adapt it for the enjoyment and recreation of the public."
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-In answer to my noble friend's question, I wil state the course which has been taken by the Government with reference tothis matter. On the 26th of July, 1856, tho report of the committe3 was sent to the City Remembrancer, for observations, with an intimation that it would be the duty of Government to consider before the meeting of Parliament the propriety of introducing a Bill for the appropriation of Smithfield. On the Sd of December the cityreplied that they dissented from the opinion of the committee, and that they could no. recognize the claim of the Crown to the site, and submitted that such right must be substantiated by law before any legislative proceedings could be taken. In order, however to avoid such proceedings, they requested the Treasury to assent to their plan for a dead meat-market. On the 20th of December the Treasury repEled that they could not consent to the proposed appropiation of the site. But, before taking measures to establish the right of the Crown, they requested to be informed "w hether the corporation could
roposeanydestination-ofthe siteto apuhlcohject,in -which
jer Iaestys Government may be able to concur." On the 27th of July last the City Remembrancer replied that the Corn and Markets Committee hoig at an early periot to lay some propocition before Her iajesty's Goveratment
That proposition has not yet been received, hut a letter has been addressed to the city authorities, calling their attention to the tate of the question, and asking for information as to their intentions concerning it.
THE DUTY ON HORSES.
Mr. T ER SEYC ER a-ed the right hon. gentleman the Chmcellor of the Exchequer vwhether, in the event of the Yeomanry Cavalry not being called ont for eight days' permanent duty during the ensanr. year, he was willng, in accordance with precedent, to remit the horse duty to the enrolled members of tho Yeomanry corps ?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER replied the a if sunicient cause were shown for not calling out the Yeomanry for eight days duty the Government would, as had been the practice on former similar occasions, remit the duty for the ernamg year.
Sir J. PAKINGTON{..-For the ensuing financial year?7
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-The communication I have recived from the Inland Revenue Board only says " for the ensuing year."
THE CRIMEAN COMMISSION.
Mfr. J. EWART asked the noble viscount the First Lord of the Treasury whether it was the intention of Government to make any furthei recognition of the services of Sir John MINeill and Colonel Tulloch in the Crimea ?
Lord PALMERSTON.-Her MaesWs Government hava made what I conceive to be ample recognition of the merit of these services. We have acknowledged them in thil House. They have been acknowledged by letters to those hon. gentlemen; and, moreover, Her Aajesty's Government intimated to them their intention of recommending the Crown to present to each of them a sum of 1,0004. as a more material acknowledgment of the services which they performed during the three mont hs that they were in the Crimea. They have thought fit to decline this gift. I do not question their motives, but it seems to me that the Crown has done aU that it can properly be advised to do,
SUPPLY-REPORT.
The report of the resolutions agreed to in the CommitLea of Supply yesterday was brought up and agreed to.
SUPPLY-COMMrrTEE.
THE CRIMEA- COMMISSION.
On the motion that the Speaker should leave the chair, in order that the House might go into Committee of Supply,
Mr. PALE. rose to move resolutions recognizing the importance of the services renderod by Sir John M'Neil and Colonel Tulloch to the army in the Crimea. The hon. member aid that no one could have forgotten the return of tho Guards to London, and any one who witnessed that eveut muA have been struck by the bronzed and martisl appearance of the men, who had gathered fresh laurels in every encounter in which they had been engaged, and must still remerAber how the caps of the Grenadiers of England were thrown up in order to testify their loyalty to the Queon. It was, however, a Ostil more thriUing and remarkable sight to see the population of London throw aside the bounds of conventional respect, and with lond exies welcome th, Guards to their native land, On that occsion The people of London were the faithful representatives of tho nation at large. Eng. land Wasnot a warlike nation; it delighted most in the arts of peace and in the enterprlses of commerce. Yet go wherethey would-to the manufacturing cities or to the agricultural counties-but one feeling prevailed throughout thelengthand breadth of the land-namely, honour, re-aPet, and regard for our brave army. The Guards were welcomed to this city on that memorable day, but amid the just elation with wbhich those who ha fought for their country were univerlly reoeived the sad thought intruded itself unbidden of hof many of their heroic comrades had been left behind on a distant shore-allant men who had died, not at the Alma or at Inkermann, not in the trenches or onxthe battle field, but by the misery and destitution which the inefficiency of our establishments occasioned. It wasinthe beginning of 1854 that the sad accountsfirst
reacnea us which toon convulsed the country from one end of the kingdom to the other. They told of disasters greater than had ever before been encountered by any British force
.~-di~sst so great that the miseries of the fatal Waleheren expedition paled before them; and men stood aghat at the prospect of the further horrors which awaited our army. So extreme was the crisis that an event then hap-
pened which was wholly unparalleled. 27w Tirsi newspaper assumed the Exocutive of England, and, by its wide circulation andthe aic of the means at its dispo6al, raised a lrge gum of money, and Instantly sent it to the relief of the sufferers. Tho Country w aroused; Parliament was called together; and the hon. and learned member for Sheffield demanded and, ln spIte of aUl tho reistance and the [evasions of the Government, carried in that House a cormmittee of inquiry as to the state of the British amy. The result of that committee's labours was well known t then all; but one argument used against its appointment, and the argument whieh, lla bi opinion, had the greatest. forte, was that it was nfair- for- a onitte at home to judge of the act and proooding of our offiers. abroad In senrequenceOf thistheGovernmentordered a commision of their own, and- sent out Sir J. cill and Colonel Tl. loCh to investigate the state of Affais on the spot. These
t6o ommiMioners acordingl9 examined, peraonally or collectively,the comanmding ofieer, sgeon, and quxrter. master of -everycorps intheCrimes andtheyreportedthat -the sufferings of the army must have been intense; that the strength of the men gave wayunder exceesiv, watching,eposure, and privatIon, They stated that the
defective departmental arrangements in the Crimea had contributed in no inconsiderable degree to the sufferings of the troops, nd they'pointed out that the system hitherto ralied on failed under the exigencies of the Crimea campaign. They further stated that the 3nortality of the army on al previous occasions ank into comparative insignificanoo, and by a return lately presented to the House they had a detailed list of the losses austained. The newspapers of January, 185, asserted facts connected with the mortality of the army, which were over and over again contradicted in that House; but a few months afterwards the Crimean commssoners came to conclusions precisely the samo as those wh.ih had been published by the press ; and latterly the statements of the commissioners were corroborated, ir a manuer that could not be controverted, by the returns whlich had been laid before Parlament * r
"The generaal total of all the regiments or corps vwhich originally lanlded, in the EALst was 55,550; the tota of noncommissioned officers and men who were added to these during the progress pf the war was 27,371; thus the total of British troops from first to last amounted to no lesi than 82,901. Of these 18,927 were lklled or died. But in anotber column we have the number killed returned aS 2 593 and, as of the 11,361 returned as wounded only 1,848'sub sequently died, we can well believe the statemen,t of Colonel TIlloch, that up to the time of his inquiry 10,000 mucn had perished, independently of the losses inflicted by the enemv. But there is one fact,which has not yet been sufficiently brought forwatd,-how many men were dis-bled by sickness without actnrlly finding a grave in tho East ? The answer given in the return is statling. No less than 11,374 men were invalided, or became non-effective up to September
1855. Put, then, these two numbers together-tbe 1i,927 who actuall died, aud the 11,374 who were disabled, and we have the total loss of the British army 30,301 for a period of 18 months, only 12 of which were passed in presence of the enemy. In round numbers, out of 80,000 men we lost .30,000 during the war."
This,fearful mortality ronsed the people of England as one man, and induced the Government to send out commissioners to investigate its causes. The British army landed in the Crimea on the 14th of September, and the first step was t
leave their knapsacks behind. He was told th%t this was sometimes done in order to relieve the soldiers,and that, when done in certain circumstances and under careful provisions, no great misery resulted from it. In this case, however, the commonest precautions were unfortunately omitted. The knapsacks left on board the different transports remained there. Some went to Varna, some to Baltshik, the rest were scattered over the sea; and. the soldiers did not receive them for months afterwards, and, indeed, some never received theirs at all. Another cudious fact was that the knapsacks on that occasion did not contain the usual amount of necessaries carried by the men. A large quantity of those atticles was left in the squad-bags at Scutari. Why these squad-bags were not collected together and conveyed from Scutari for the use of the troops, as they easily might have been in a very few days, he was unable to gather from the voluminous reports before them. This neglect, he firmly believed, was the origin of the disease and distress to which the army was exposed. They commenced a siege without a change of clothing, without the indispensable means of cleanliness, without a second pair of -shoes; and from this cause alono they were reduced to a state of wretchedncsssuficientto account for a great portion of their mortality, even if there had been no fault to find with their supplies of food. The kmalsack of the soldier was, perhaps, of more importance to him than any of his other accoutroments, because through the want of it he was unable to keep his change of linen dry, or to collect and preserve the various articles essential to the maintenance of cleanliness, and therefore of bealth. Tho result was that, after two months, the army which had received the adiens of its Queen; which it was the boast of the Minister of the day that he had sent out equipped with everv necessary, and rich in everything that could make a force effective; which was, in fact, an expedition the i-c of which had never before left the British shores-this proud army, the discipline-of which no suffering was able to relax, was allowed gradualUy to sink under cold, starvation, and disease, until it was at length brought by the accumulated neglect cf those whose duty it was to administer to its wants to the lowest point of human wretchedness. Thb next circumstance which a careful examination of the reports had strongly impressed upon him waq, that although warm clothing to a great amount was upon the spot, yet, for some reason which was not explained, it was never received by the troops. Their clothes were threadbare, their shoes were worn out, they were shivering in the cold, and drenched in the rain; andyetatthisverytimetherwasanample store of greatcoats in the Quartermaster-General's department. The commissioners examined Major Wetherall, the Assistant Quartermaster-General, on this point, and on being asked bow it was that out of about 12,000 greatcoats in store only 2,376 had been issued to the army that officer stated that, as far as he was aware, it never had been contemplated to give more than one regimental greatcoat to each soldior, especially at a time when additional warm clothing was daily expected, and that he thought it absolutely neoessary to keep a supply of greatcoats in store, to meet the demands which might be made in the ordinary couse of the service. To those who were notsowellaccustomod to all thedetaiisof military regalation as this gallant officer it must appear somewhat strange that, because thearmy might perhaps snffer at some future time for want of Feateoxts, its present necessities wero thorefore to be entirely uncared for and unrelievedL Most certainly, had that galLant officer given out to the sol. diers that additional clothing which was then in his stores it would have saved the life of many a poor wretch who had died, not from hunger but from cold. The next point which remained unexpianed, and of which he at once acquitted the heads of departments of the army in the East, was the supply of green coffee to the army. The name of tho offieW who had given that unfortunate order had never yet been mentioned, and for his own sake it wVS to be hoped that it never would. In the papers laid before Parliament no reasons nor aguments for ssning green coffee to the troops were to bo found; all that appeared there wan the order itself, which was given by the Treasury, bat by what department or what person in the Treasury he had been unable to ascertain. Sir J. NNeill and Colonel Telloch attributed the mortality and distress to certain departmental inefficiencie, The Board of General Offlcers attdbuted this distress mainly to the want of forage for the mules and horses of the Commissariat department. Taking the view of the Board of General Officers first, whose fault -was it that the forage was not sent out? CommissaryGeneral Filder made repeated req'isitions to the depart
ment at home for pressed hay; it was totally impossible for him to carry unpressed hasy, nd without it the transport animals could not be maintained. So far he agreed with the rnaLrd of General Officers that CommissaryGeneral Filder had made out a good excuse for himself, but still there was a fault somewhere. He was the last man in the world to bring an accusation agaist absent persons, but it appeared prettyoertain from the papers that.ommissaryGeneral Filder had made repeated requisitions to the de partment at homo, but Sir Charles Trevelyan, reasoning for himself, judging for himself, and believing himself to be a better judge of the wants of the army in the Crimea than the Commnssary-General, failed to send out to Mr. Filder those supplies on which, according to the Board of General Officers, the efficiency of the army mainly depended. Sir J. MINeill and Colonel Tullochtook a different view and thought that though hay and chopped straw minght Lave been difficult to procure, yet barley might have been got to any amount, and upon that the transport animals might have been maintained for somu mouths in full vigour. He was not prepared to say that the view of Sir John M'Neill and Colonel TUlloch was correct, but certainly, however generally free from blame Mr. Filder might have boen, there appeared to be a great want of ingenuity and contrivance onhis part in this matter. After making al alUowances for the difficulty of the position, he was most reluctantly brought to the opinion that the Commissary-General had failedto make those great exertions which the exigencies of the crse demanded. He had no wish too narrowly to scan the actions of public men, for it was impossible alwAys to be aware of the difficulties which they had to overcome; but it was udficieut for him to have shown, as he thought he had, that the mortaliLy of the British army was great, excessive, and unusual. fle did not wish to fix the blame upon any one in particular, but heo hoped that the next Parliament would undertake to apply to the British.army the only remedy which could insure it against the repetition of disasters of this kind. This, in his opinion, was a eomplete revision of the army departments-not so much of the regulations and arrngements of the departments themselves as of the officers who were intrnsted with the dnties of them. If he had the honour of a seat in the next Parliament he should be able to prove to the House from the evidence lxtely published in the report of the commissioners sent to inquire into the education of foreign armies that our system of officering the British army was not adequate to the wants of tbe present day. For the future tho army must be officered by men who had been educated for a military career, s,nd who had been trained from early life to strain every nerve and to exert all their abilities in difficult and trying circumstances. If this could be done the efficiency of the army would begreatly increased without anysacrifice of the hih character andgentlemanly bearing which had
alwys Oatngm shea tho British offices,. We could no longer be considered an unwarlike nation, and the improvement of our army ought to be regarded as one of the most im-
tant topics which could be considered by the Legislature. ore sitting down he hada few words to address to tho right hon. member for fanchester. It was a sad thing to see a great man irn distress, nd it was almost as sad to soe the right hon. gentleman in want of a cry with which to go to the hustings. "Peace, retrenchsnent, and reformnI the right hon. gentleman said would no longer do Peace bad been concluded.

" Sir,-I havo the honour to state that, when under examination to-day before the Court, I was questioned as to whether I had any evidence to sho w that the renort of Sir John 'WNeill and myself had been approved by Lord Panimure nnd Her Majesty's Government. I replied that I underseood the publication of the report inferred such approval, as also that Lord Palmerston had expressed it in the lonse ; but as neither of these assertions seemed ta be sufflicient, and the only evidence I have on the subject i.e to be inferred from private memoranda, it would be of much service and save discussion if you could forward to me a. letter to the Board of General Officers early to-morror, stating that the report was approved by Her Majest!'s Goverument before oeing madcepublic.

dnr. BLACK said, his constituents took great interest in this subjec, and he had presented three potitions-one frol
the Lord Provost and mnagistrates of Edinburgh, another from a company of merchants, and a third from the Deanl of Faculties, members of the legal profession, clergymen and merchants, urgng the Goverment to bestow some suR. cient mark of their approbation upon the commissioners. At the time the commissioners were sent out the honour of Britain wa at stake, and the very existence of one of the finest armies that ever left these shores was imperiled. He thou ht the Government adopted a t dicious course inl eputing two gentlemen possessing such undeniable qualfications to i oVestgate to r cause of the calamities which had befairen the army. The commissioners resolved -to give up all the comforts of home in order that they might beiuseful to the armay and their country, and the way in which they discharged the duty intruted tothemdid themthe highsthonour. They examined 200 witnesses, anl spent 55 days in the investigation, which they desistod from only when compelled by bad helth. What added greatly to the credibility of the evidence was, that the notes o every witness's examination were submitted to him to be revised and corrected, and he beleved that, with the exoeption of two, all the witnesses revised in this way their evidence, The commissioner.thad conferred an incalculable benefit on their country, and had embodied in the records of that House Anxinvaluable account of tho mode of remedying errors and defects which in future times might be the means of saving the ltves of thousands of our countrymen. (Hear,) Innmiaking their investigzations they did not purse their inquiries among the men who were grambling and discontented, but they examined the commanders, the doctors, the adjutants, and all whose position was such as to make them acquaintedt with the facts, Wellxmight Sir J. I'Neill say 'at the Crime-an banquxet in Edinburgh that if the Government in. tended that this inquiry should be a shami they ought to. have employed other instrumaents for that purpose, becausen for anything but an honest purpose these menwere incapable, of acting (Har, hear.) After the report of the inquirywaslaid on. the table certain.officersthouhtthat it conveyed a censure upon their conduct, and, belonging to high andL influential famiies, they procured a boardl of inqcuiry. with thle view of vindicating their conduct. That board came to the conclusion that for what had occurred in the, Crimea, there was nobody to blamae, but that all the disorders and evils there had arisen from causes which no foresight and no inge-Cnuity could have prevented. But, while they thus vindicated the conduct of the officers, they did not show the same tenderness for the Crimean Corn. Now, if genLtlemen employed in the public service inthisway did not find their labeurs appreciated and rewArded as they ought to be,- how could it be expected that others wouldt engage in similar labours ? (Hear, hear.) At the present. 3moment, whoocould have been betteremIloydasso ommissioner in China than Sir J. M?Nel? (erha.)it had been said these gentlemen did n oeta hi uy but.he would ask whether Loyd Lucn oLrdCdia,orGeneral Airey, or Colonel Gordon, l fwo hdotie
honursor romtios,had done meretha thir duty?2 (Her, ear) Iecould not but think that thee ust ho somne barrier in the way which preventedths two commissioners from obtaining such arecognition ofthei services As they desrvd but he trusted the noble lord would break throu,gh altese invisible fences and that he would not fail to honu thos to whom honour was due. (Hear, hear,)
Lord PALIAERSTOIT.-I am anxious to remaove an - pression which seems to have been produced on the mind of mny hon. friend who has just sat downx that, either in point of intention or in point of fast, there was anything in the instructions given to these two commisaloners that could be called a sham,. There was nothing In the manner in which they were appointed, or in the manner in which their instructions were given to them, or in the manner in which the investigation was conducted and inL which their report was received that could in the slihtest degree justify such anassertion. (Hear, hear.) They were selected from a regard to their knowledge andl their compe. tence for the task which they had to discharge. That task was accomplished with rcrit to themselves andaAdvaatageo to the puLblc, andthe Government have fullyexpressed theirsense of the gret services so rendered. (Hear.) With zegard to the speech of the hon, mnember opposite (Mr. Palk), it really seemed to me to be a complete anachronism. It was a spoeeca that would have been very mauch in point two
yeara ago, whoe tho sufferings Of the ar-my weresuch as he has described them to have been-when all the attention of the Government, Atimulated, by the impulse of this House, was neessary to relieve those sufferings at a moment when they had not yet roceived their appropriate remedies. But really, at this time of day, whenthe war has been concludet and peace established, when a year has elapsed since the termination of tho war, to go back upon thoe Ate of things that existed in December, 185I, does seem to me to be not tho most ueful applictionof the time of this House. (Hear, hear.) My first answer to tho hon. gentleman is, that these sufferings ces nearlytwo months beforethe commissioner3 got to tho Crimea; that whereas In the nrst winter the army was In a state of great mIsery and desUttution, and severe Suffering, after that it Wa in a condition. that excited the e' vy and admiration of all who saw it (hear, hea)infnitely bette than that of the French army, iafinitely better than that of the Russian army; and that at the end of the wat it was in every respect in a condition not equalled by sny iumber of troops in any pert of the world, not even by troops at home, (Hear.) Therefore, the speech of thehon,gentlm nisonlyarecitspof ealanes pastand gos0ejaud which wereremediedonthe veryspot and in tihe ver' *rvice to whichhis spech zelates. It iB quite true that th muerig of the army were great. The hon. gentlEmLn hat gono through al the details with whioh -wo are familiar, It ia qite true that tho knapsacks Were lefi on lO d the ships at the landing which took place before
the bato of the Alma, and it is quito true that those knapacs:did enot reach the men for two or three =onths after thty had ltpded, At.tAh same time that is not.
-h pioed stato of things. I Was conversing a day or two ago %ith an hos. and gallant friend of mine who served in one <f the campaigns at the Cape, and he assured me that throughout that campaign the troops had no knapsacks and no tents, and had only their blarnkets to screen them from the weather; but that, nevertheless, they did not suffer from 1.he exposure. It is true that ample supplies wvere sent from this country to the Crimea, but that from want of arrangesnents on the spot the troops there derived no advantago from them. (EIear, hear.) It is true there were 10,003 great coats sent which might have been served out, but were kept in store. (E[ear, hear.) It is quite true, likewise, $hat there wero boots in store that no one knew anything about, and that there was foragoeat Constantinople while the animals were starving in the Crimea. (Hear, hear.) It is tue, also, that a ship loaded with rice was sent to convey an ofiicer from Constantinople to Beicos. (Hear, hear.) All this arose from local confasion springing from great and important services being performed by men not accustomed to the details of such services. (Hear, hear.) That was the real cause of the confusion that occurred-not any want of arrsngement at home. The different departments sent rout ample stores of all kinds for the wants of the army; but, partly in consequence of the rapid transfers 'of the army from one scene of operations to another, as from Tarkey to the Crimea, the necessary sepa. ration of parties, and varions other reasons, it is true there was not that arrangement and that foresight exhi. bitod which afterwards, when the offcials became accus tomed to their duties, fortunately prevailed. (Hear.) The supply of anituals for fresh meat was at the beginning noproperly arranged, the hospitals were not properly arranged. -or cleansed, or ventilated, and the sick did not derive that advantage from them which they ought to have done. {Hear.) But when the hon. gentleman speaks of the mortalityof the army and of the great losses we sustainedwhich losses he thinks aight have been greatly lessened by bette1garrangements on the part of the Government-he s< mauch mistaken if he imagines that those losses wera at all greater than those of the French or the Russian amy. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the two commissioners, no doubt they did their duty exceedingly well; but when did they go out? They went out in April and returned in July. These gentlemen, no doubt, suggested very material alterations while they were there; yet in so far as their report furnished the Government at home wvith the elemssents of better arrangements, those arrangements had already been carried out, many important improvements dmsingtaken place beforethecommissionersreturned. ( Hear.) Moreover, they were not the only commissioners. There was a medical commission, consisting of Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Gavin, who unfortunately lost his life, and Alr. Rawlinson, an engineer, who was wounded in an action in which bhe had unnecessarily placed himself. I am bound to say, without disparagement to Sir John M'NeUl and Colonel atlloch, that the medical commissioners conferred greater advantages upon the public at home and upon the army in the Crimea than it was possible for them to accomplish. Dr. Sutbesland and his associates took the medical arrangeraents of the hcspitals and of the camp into immediate consideration, and suggested improvements which were of the uimost consequence to the troops in the field as well as to the sick and wounded. (Hear, hear.) Then it is said that it was a great iDjustice to Sir John lsi'Neill and Colonel Tulloch to appoint the Board of General Officers which held its sittinugs at Chelsea. That Board, horwever, was not al&ointed to reviEe the report of the commissionrs. T.lhere were certain officers of rank-rank, if yenu will, both social and military-whose reputation was dear to them, who had left the Crimea before Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch began their inquiries, whom, therefore, they could not examine on the spot, but with regard to whose conduct certain statements had been made to the commissioners which were included in their report; and whEn that report was published those officers, jealous of their henour and reputation. asked for an opportunity of
iing that explanation of their conduct which, not having ben in the Crimea at the time when the investigation took place, it was absolutely and physically impossible they could nave given to the commissioners. That request was not made in sesrret or without public discussion; for it was in this House we were called upon to appoint somse authority te whom these officers should make their statement. It was held net to be decorous that they should vwrite letters in the niev. sajpers in answer to the report of the Crimean Commissioners, or that those who happened to be members of Parliament should take advantage of their position as such to deliver speeches in their own defence. It was felt thab the onlv just course towards them would be to appoint some beard of military officers, competent to be judges, to receive their statements and to hear what they bad to say in exoneration of that part of their conduct which they believed to be impugned by the report of the commis-sioners. The Board of General Officers, therefore, was not appointed to sit in judgment upon Sir J. M'NeiU and Colonel Tulloch; on the contrary, its appointment was an act of simple juseice to those officers who desired to explain their conduct in the Crimea, and was an act, moreover, which seemed to receive the sanction of Parliament at the time. (Fiear hear.) The motion of the hon. gentleman is not one which ought to be assented to by the House at the present moment. The first part of it records facts which nobody disputes -viz., the sufferings of the army at the time to which the motion refers-but the latter part consists of censures upon certain officers belonging to certain branches of the service. I think it w oulld be ungenerous at this time of day to go back and cersure their conduct after it has been subjected to investigation, and after the whole subject lias, to a certain degree, passed into the domain of history. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman, towards the conclusion of his speech, expressed a hope that arrangements migbt be made for the better instruction of officers of the army; that young men might no longer enter the army intending to remain for two or three years only, but that all officers might in future make the military profession the serious business of their lives, devoting their whole thoughts to it. That is the system in foreign countries, but it has not been adopted in England, and, you may depend upon it, never will be, .(Hear, hear.) In foreign countries large standing armies are kept up in time of peace' when a man embraces the military professicn he knows that he will be a soldier as long as health and strength remain, and he therefore devotes a.l his thoughts to it, in order to obtain promotion in the service and reputation among bis fellow-citizens. In England we purbue a different course. WVe have in times of peace a very small army, and when war -comes 'we are obliged to increase it, sometimes very rapidly. Officers who enter the army during war must expect when peace arrives to have their services dispensed 'with. It is a great object also to have our service voluntary, not compulsory, for voluntary service has something inspiritiDg in itself, and if it has its inconveniences it has likewise its advantages, the loss of which would be -dearly purchased by the adoption of the Continental system. (Bear, bear.) Therefore, -whatever arrangements we mav snake-and I trust the Government will be able to make them-for imparting to our military officers more professional instruction than hitherto they have had either the means or the inducement to acquire, depend upon it that tht system which the hon. gentleman wishes to Eee prevail, -viz., that none should enter the army except those who intend to mahe it the study and business of their livescannot be adopted in England. Ib is not consistent with the nature of our institutions or with our nationalcharacter and habits. We must take advantage of the voluntary -service of those who go into the army, wh ether they mean
to remain a long or a short time. We cannot be a military nation, but depend upon it we are a fighting nation ("Hear, hear l" and a laugh), and those very men who in times of peace join the army, as the hon. gentleman says, for the pleasure of wearing a fine coat, are found when war arrives as distinguished for their bravery in the field (hear, hear), for their endurance of fatigue, and for their submission to all the hardships of military life as the officers of any Con. tirental army who have been driled and tutored and lectured, who may answer better to the abstract notion of soldiers, but who, when placed at the head of troops in battle, or when told to charge or defend a position, are not -euperior to our own officers, whatever may be the difference between them in point of technical instisaction and knowledge of the minute details of the service. (Cheers.) I hope that the hon. gentlemarn having satisfied himself by making ihonourablementionof the commissioners-in which Ientirely -concur with him-having expressed his regret at the sufferlngs of the army in the early part of the Crimean. war, and not having-though I trust it passed through his mind; very often hon. gentlemen sit down without saying what they meat (a laugh)-congratulated the country upon the great improvement which subsequently took place, will not press his motion to a division, but will al ow us to go into Com asittee of Supply. (Hear, hear.)
Sir J. FITZGERALD thought that the inquiry conducted 'by Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel Tullooh in the Crimea was subversive of the discipline of the army, and he certainly ,would never consent to a resolution which censured officers who acted under the authority of official superiors.
General PEEL.-I cannot agree with the noble lord at the head of the Government that the time of this Hous3
cas be wasted by inquiries into the causes of the calamities 'which occurred in the Crimea. (Hear, hear.) I am aware of the ridicule to which I should naturally -and justly expose myself if I were to offer any vrofesdional opinion upon the ovents of the Crimean campaign, and I am awarealso of the difficulties under which I labour in speaking in the presence of so many offM. -cers who served before Sebstopol. But we may depend upon it that the military profession is as subject to the rules of common sense as any other (hear); and I see no reason "why any member of this House, who has carefully examined the evidence laid onithe table, should not be in a condition to torm an opinion upon the question before us. (Hear.) Fox my own part, having pmased two whole summers in investlgating this matter, contrary, I may be permitted to say, to my own wishes, and contrary to my expressed opinion as to any advantage to be derived from our inquirioa -I havo arrived at the opinion that the calamities which occurred in the Crimea arose from circumstances which it was not in the power of any individual in the Crimea to control. (Hear, hear.) Iam happy to find that Lord Pan. mire eressed the same opinion in the speech which he made iTArbroath. The mistake of those who have been for*emoet in demanding inquiry into the sufferings of the Crimean army coneists in the attempt to throw the blame upon individuals. (Hear, hear.) I am certain that any. body 'who reads the evidence given by the hbad bf the War Department must admit that he did every. thing in his power to avert the calamities that befell the ariny, and that he was only responsible with the rest of the Government for what took plac. I dlso believe that 4dmil Boxer, Captain ChriLtie, and Lord Ragl&u icU
victimis to that senseless clamnour wl;.cl was reised against them in this country upon anonyou auhrt Cer.
2No, Sr, hve lwas atepted to remodel- bad sysems, instead of attacking the inaividueai who had to workc them.W Let itnotfora moment be supposea that ltmderratethehard. shiPs and PrivatiOns to which the army- wasisubject during I he winter of 1854.5. So far froma undlerrating them, I thi'nk it is impossiblo to exaggerate them ;and equally impossible would it be to exaggerat the patience and heroism 'with which they were endured. (Cheers.) BuLt, adusittiug, theo hardships endured by this army, I believe that nlobody was responLsible for them. I am perfectly a ware that when I SaY so I mnay well be asked, 1 ~t then were, in your opinion, the causes of those hardships?'p I think that the time hlas gone by when there ouLght to be any delicacy whatever in answering that questin I eiv ta
chief cause was Your commencement of a great war with little means. (Loud cries of "tHear, hearI") Thc army was deficient in everything but in the bravery, discipline, and boldness of its troops. (Cheers.) With that army suffering niucha from sickness you undertook a great military operation 'without any reserve whatever. The Government were not s-i rea~poisible fo,r that as the country, which raised the unive-rsal cry that the war should be carried on with vigour. I think that the GovernLment were to blame for not having foreseeli at an earlier periodl the poisibility of the army baving to remain in the Crimsen during the winter of 1851-5. 1 am perfectly aware that there was a general beli ef that the army would iiot have to rerami there during that winter, and that it was not till after the battle of inkermann that it became certain that it would have to winter in the Crimes. It is to the position in which the armay then was that I attribute the calamities which afterwards inevitably occurred. Lord Raglan had nio resources whatever with which to overcome the dbfficulties by wvhich he was surrounded ; nor could he abandon his guns, his allies, and the honouir of his country by endeavouring to re-embark his army'. I do not think that he would have succeeded in that endeavour. Her er)But, 'whatever might be the severity of the lorsbp bic he had to endure, ari7body who knew Lord Raglan must feel that ke would minatain hins position as long as he had a single regiment. (Hear, hear.) The
arywas exlhausted by work beyond its strength. It was not a'ule to keep u's that road of conamunication.whlch lay between it and th; harbour of Balaklava, 'where the 'provisions intended for it were landed. An outcry 'was raisd in this country againstthe War Department because that road to Balalelava was almost impassable; but that cry only showed the injustice of blaminmg individuals for occuLrrences over 'which they had no control. From wanit Of a system of sufficient land carriage the horses belonging to the cavalry had to struggle to their knees in mud unader buirdens of provision for the army. The want of that land carriage is admnitted, I bielieve, on all hands, to have been the principal cause of ine misfortunes 6f the army, and it therefore well deserves the consideration of this House. It does n-ot appear to have orii ted, in the first instance, from a 'want of IT-Irfor y OuL had 2,000 at C~ n- stantinople. It appears to have originated from the impossibilty of providing forage for in. re than a small number of the animals in the Crimea. I think, then, that a common-sense view of that positionx of affairs 'would have led to the reduction of the number of the horses, as -you had not the power of keeping them in the Crimea. This brings me to another great cause of the hardships endured by the army. It struck me from the fiast momnent that the 'wisest plan under these circumstanices would have been t-o re-emnbark- the cavalry and send them to Varna or to Constantinople during the winter, and to take ba ggag anml t the Crfimea for the purpose of affordinig communaication between the army and Balaklava. It struckc mie that it was 'worse than useless to keep th~e cavalry horses in the Crimealduring the winter, for, supposing even that there had not been any danger of their starvatio~n, the mere exposure of them to a Crimean winter, and use of them as baggage animals, would render the'm useless in battle. I therefore put the question to the first cavalry officer that was examined before the Crimnean Commission, whtther I had not formed a correct opinion as to 'what ought to have been donae in this respect? His answer was that it would have no doubt been beneficial to the cavalry if such a course haad been adopted, hut that the moral effect of it would have been had. It seerasto me, however, thatthe maoral effect of nur horses dying of starvation and eating one another's tails could not have been very bsneficial.I perfectly understood the meaning of that answer to be, that it would have had a had effect upon our allies if we had endeavoured to re-embark any portion of our army. And this brings usie to another subject, and that is the evll that always must arise from the actionx of combined armies servinguderf ore head. (Cheers.) Depend upon it that howeve cRdIa, however perfectly allied, however perfectly united the forces miay he, there always must arise qluestioisa the settlement of 'which by the one person mn comimand of those combined armies will give dissatisfaction. It must be evident to everybody who has read the e,vidence laid before the House, that the loss of th~e Light Brigade of cavalry duming the earlier part of the winter was in consequence of the position whichi was assignt d to the Brli5h army. That position -was the result of an agreenient between LordaRaglan andathe French General.
Te danger to which the cavalry was exposed was poinited out to Lord Raglan, but he dida not coniider himself at liberty to ehbsoge its position. I believe that the agreesment is no secret ui hatever. I have heard it reneated 50 timnes. I have lheard that its history 'was this-whien Lord Itag!an found his army sinking from overwork and dyinig int the trenches he applied to the French General for assistance, or rather -for a fresh division of the labour according to the strength of the army, the French army having received an accession of a great number of troops that were carried by.our ow,n transports at a time when they'were most reqisireidfor our own army. (Hear, hear.) It is said that the Mivsio of labour 'was psomised on condition that our cavalry was to he at the immediate service of the French army. The difficulty of foraging thte cavalry wspited out, but the answer was very laconic--"Nlo cavalry,no divison of labour." Although our cavalry was then put inx a position w-here it must of necessity starve, yetlIthink that it perfectly fulfilled the purpose for which it, was used, mnamely, that of acting lie a scarecrow and frighteninog the Russians away. I believe that the calamities 'which befell our arniy during the winter of 1854-5 are a-ttributable, not to the heads of our military departments, but to the organization and a-rangements of those departments, Into the Commissariat Department there have already been introducd changes 'which I trust will prove to be beneficial. Tha Commissariat has already been removed froux the Treasury and placed unuder the control of the Secretary for War. The Tranlspoist Service has been removed from the Commissarist. I trust that the uLnomalic-s in the Quartermaster-General's Department will be done away withi. There is no departmnent on which the comfort of the army is more dependent than on that of the Quartermaster-General, andl yet he has not the power of executing upon his own responsibility any one of tie duties which he has toDperform. He is dependent upon other departments for the performance of those duties for 'which he is responsible. I believe that we shall profit by the experienice 'which we gained in the Crimea. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the Crimean Commission, I beg to observe that 'we had no power whatever to enter upon fresh inquiries, but merely to receive explanations from certain o fcers who thought that their conduct had beeni impugned by the report of Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel Talloch. It seems from the first paragraph of a work lately pubIlshed that considerable excitement has been created by the report of the commission against the c.fflcrs supposed to be responsible for the CrimEan report. Great objections have beer taken to the formation of that beard ; and the Judge-Advocate has stated that the officers composin it wvere all of the sa-me political opinion as the two noble lords who appearedabefore it. I don't Iknow 'where may right hen, friend obtained that information ; but Ilam afraid that if Colonel Tulloch had known the real truth we should have been subjected to a much graver charge-that of being a coalition. (Cheers and a laugh.) Persons of the same political views may come to any conclusion they please without being stigmatized; but if the case he so strong& as to induce persons of different political opinions to agree there maust be a coalition. I ama afraid, then, that I coalesced upon that occasion, for I have the authority of three out of the other four officers who composed the board for denying altogether that they are of the same political opinions as myself. (Laughter.) At all events-we were not in a position to show our politics there, end-what Is more -a soldier has no politics connected with his profession. (Cheers.) IE am really surprised, therefore, at the repetition of such a charge, even in this book, 'which professes to be an attack upon the board of general officers. I should be quite ready, if necessary, to go through and to verify every opinion which was expressed by that beard - but that would be only a waste of time, and I shall cZonln myself, therefore, to dealing vesy shortly wvith eceh case, showing the best reasons whY we came to the conclusions that we dlid. With reference to LordLucn'seas, i is nlynecssay Ithinkc, to quote one authrit, 'hic it s iposibl 1~oppose, and 'which Coloel Llloc, wo ha conraditedeverything else, will, I hae n dobt,admi. Te athoityto which I allude is thefolowig sateen, 'hic 'ws mdeby Lord Lucau in
"For himself he felt little concern, because immediately after the conclusion of the evidence Colonel Tulloch came over to hiim, and, although he had never sad a word or commaunicated 'with that gallant officer before, he, Colonel Tulloch, said he thought it due to him (the Earl of Lucan) to state that had he not been misled by the evidence given him in the Crimea by General Airey and lieutenant Gordon, he or the other commiissioner would never have said a word to his (the Earl of Lucan's) disadvantage."
I Ceers.) Therefore it a prs that, according to Colonel >'ulloeh's owinviewv, Lord Incan had perfectly justified himself. (Hear, hear., With regard to Lord Cardigan, it seems to me that his is just the case of a man vho gave the Ivery good reason for not paying his debts that he had no money. Lord Cardigan did not do certain things that were suggested, because he had no authority; and it was ptoved thabt he had no power to do more than he did. (Hear, hear,) As to General Airey, the House will remember that when these commissioners went to the Crimea to inquire into the case of the stores and the Commissariat Department,another offlcer was sent out with the full authority of the Govern. ment to inquire into the conduct of the staff officers; and 'when I read to you the instructions which were given to General Simpson and his report upon the subject I think that the House -ll see tha-t that is far botter evidence as to the conduct of the staff officers than any 'which could possibly be given by the commissioners, Mloreover, those offlcers never received any intimation of any chaTge boing bronght against them, and the first syllable hichthey.eard about it was upon the appearance of the blue-book. (Hear, hear.) The instructions which were sent to General Simpson 'in the Crimea, at the same time that the commissioners went out, were iu these words:-
"It will be your duty to look into the composition of the general staff of the army and report your opinion of any change which it may ococr to you to think necessay to Field-Ilarshal Raglan. AUl appontments and removals from the general staff of the army will rest with the officerr., kin supreme comniand; but you. will not fail, if youl find D.sy ,officer inyour opinionunnlit on trial for the duties intru'Msie
o rttheame without favour or affeotiont othe !Commander-rn-Chief."
Theu' General Simpson, on the 26th of April, r'jported to Lord Raglan as follows _
4" Ever since my afrival in the camp it h.a been my daily Ontom4 bY 0ionI intorcoume, to mikqe yself acquainted
with every efficer employed on the general staff of th:s army, and there is not one of them I would Wish to see removed. I confess myself to have come among those offcers with some degree of prejudice against them in ml mind by the gross misrepresentationS current in England respecting them. I do not think a better selection of staff. officers could be made."
(Hear, hear.) Now, l really would asw my hon. friend who bronght forward this motion whether with this testimony before isnm he would ask the House to commit such an act of injustice as to say that the calamities in the Crimea arose from the conduct of tbo persons who have been mentioned. V'hatever he does with the remainder of his resolution, I trust that he will strike out that portion of it. (Hear, hear.) Allow me in justice to Mr. Filder-whom I never saw in my life-to say that I think he was exceedingly hardly pKd; because jUst at tho moment when things were improving and the wvhole Commissariat Department was rearrarged, he was removed, aud others were sent out to the Crimea who reaped the benefit of his experience and of aU that he had done. (Hear, hear.) I am perfectly willing to admit that the commissioners have done their duty most conscientiously and most fearlessly, and no doubt that duty u as a most anxious one; but I must say that I think the extent of their services has been somewhat overrated. I see, for example, that the hon. memaber for Liverpool and some hundred other most respectable gentlemen connected with that great town have agreed to the following resolution .-
" Looking back to and comparing the condition of the armay previous to the commencement of your labours with the state in which you left it, it is not too much to say that to your exertions we owo the preservation of the remnant of that noble body of men and the rescue of the country from impending failure and disgrace.'
I beg to say that the army never heard before that they had been rescued from " impending failure and disgrace" by the exertions of the commissioners. (Hear, hear.) Those gentlemen did not arrive in the Crimea until the 13th of March, by which time the former evils had been remedied, and the men were aetualy over-laden with lothing. But it was not in the power of the commissioners, according to their instructions, whatever their intentions might have been, to have done what is supposed. Their instructions were to inquire, report, and make suggestions; and the only suggestions which thoy made upon the spot which I can trace were Eomething about ovens and quinine. The commissioners never themselves attributed blame to any of those gentlemen who appeared before the board at Chelsea- but they were in haste to submit their roport to iue House before it was laid before the Commander-in-Chief, and if, when presented, ithadbeenaccompabied by that expression of the noble lord at the head of the War Department, that the calamities in the Crimea arose from circumstances which no one could control, I think that that would have been quite sufficient, and that the inquiry which took place at Chelsea never need have occurred. With reference to that inquiry
I will only add, for myself, that I have been actuated by no personal eelings whatever respecting any person. (Hear, hear ) I had as many friends and near relations, perhaps, in the Crimea as most people, and they were all regimental officers serving in the trenches; but, owing to the length of time tbhat I have been on half-psy, I had mot the honour of anything but the slightest personal acquaintance with a single officer on the staff in the Crimea. Regardless of private friendships, however, I trust that I shall alwavs havo moral courage enough to do justice to everybody. (Cheers.)
MIr. S. HERBERT,-Although I would willingly not trespass upon the time of the House, I think, considering my past relation with the Military Department, that I may be alUowed to say a few words with respect to the motion under discussion. I agree with a great deal that has falUen from my gallant friend opposite, and I confess that the first im pression which the proposed resolutions made on my mind was one of regret at the re-opening of questions which I hoped had been settled, and were not again to be adverted to. I think that woe must all feel a desire, having passed through the Crimean campaign, to draw the veil of oblivion over everything which would appear to imply blame or consure to individuals. (Cheers.) No doubt, when, after a long
I eaco, an army takes the field there must be great inexpeisnco, great deficiencies, and great confusion, and I agree with the gaUlant officer that the error which was made by the Government of which I was a member was in attemptng too much. I say frankly that I think we were to blame for so doing, but it appears to me that the main difficulty which besets us is that we never have a clear idea whom we are to try. (Hear, hear.) From the speeches of some hongentlemen it seems to be their opinion that we ought to try the Chelsea Board, but with that I have nothing to dothe general officers who constituted that board havo concluded their inquiry, and I have no doubt that they have
acted conscientiously to the best of their ability. They may have faUen into some errors, but with that we have nothing to do. It is quite true, as has been stated, that the changes which were made in the management of the army-such as the division of the Land Transport from the Commissariat, the ordering of the railway, theimproved clothing, and so on-were made previously to the arrival of the commissioners in the Crimea, because they were carried out in thu auturmn, and the commissioners did not arrive tiul the following March. I think that aU persons in this House, not excepting the hon. and gallant member for Hontingdon, will freely admit
the faithfulness and ability with which these two gentlemren fulfilled a difficult, a deheate, and a most invidious task (herr, hear), and the question we have to consider now is, not whether certain officers were to blame-not whether the Board of Officers at Chelsea were to blame, but whether two gentlemen who were sent from this coumtry to discharge a most arduous and invidious duty did discharge that duty faithfully and ably; and, if so, has the country, and has the Crown, marked in an unmistakeable manner their appro-
bation of the services performed? (Hear, bear.) I confess Iheard with great pain the noble lord at the head of the Government speak depreciatingly of the services of these
gentlemen. [Lord Palmerston denied having done so.l
Well, I am willing to do justice to the noble lord, and I hope he will do me the justice of admitting that I have done my utmost to prevent this question being brought before
the House, and that I have repeatedly pressed upon him in piivate the course which I hoped he would have adopted with regard to these gentlemen. The question however now is before the House, and I am bound to express my opinion with regard to it. The noble lord spoke of the report of Sir J. M'Neil and Colonel Tulloch as being a valuable report, but at the same time as not being more valuable than other reports which had been made. Now, the report of these gentlemen contained a mine of information upon which, no doubt, many important changes in our military administration will be founded; but was the preparation of that report the only service rendered by them I (Bear, hear.) I have been toldbymedicalmen, in whose
judgment I place great confidence, that although without
doubt a great deal of suffering was produced by privation and overwork, yet if there was one cause which morc than
any other led to the disease of scurvy among the
troops it was that they were kept so lon'g feed-
ing upon salt meat, (Hear, hear.) I believe that it is net denied that when Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel
Tulloch arrived in the Crimea the Commissariat were stil isuinghardbiscuitand salt meat, and hard biscuit was entirely useless to men whose gums were affected by scurry. It appears from statistics that deaths among the troops arose from a great variety of diseases, but I believe that those diseases were only the result of scurvy, and that scurvy wastherefore the original causeof thedestruction of the arm
Well, Sir, these gentlemen immediately commenced the introduction of fresh meat and bread in lien of salt meat and biscuits. I have heard military men say that there is this peculiarity aoout every commissariat, which is, that as long as they can get people to eat it they will always issue salt meat and biscuits; and thereason is, obviously, because it does not entail the trouble of collection. This being so
Sir J. M'INeill took measures that tenders might he sent in to Mr. Filderfrom persons offering to supply fresh meat, and at the same time Colonel Tulloch introduced the practice of
baking fresh bread, and establshed bakeries to supply the troops with fresh bread two or three days in tho week; and
thus these two gentlemen rendered a mostimportant service (hear, hear) in audition to preparing their report. Now, Sir, do not let us consider who wa to blame. I have fr"ankly
said that in one respect I think the Government were to blame, and with regard to other matters I wish to cast blame
upon no man. The report of the commissioners, except in one single sentence, and then only by implication, brought no charge against any one; andI bring no charge, for Ihave too sirong a feeling of sympathy for men engaged in so difixcult and dangerous a task as to wish to impute blameto
thewhen then thendeavour to discharge their duty to the utmost of theoir ability. Lethme, however, ask the'ouse tf it does not think it fitting that it should express some
opinion in approbation of the service of these two gentlemen (Cheers.) I would ve nture to suggest to the hon. gentleman who has moved thetoe resolutions to withdraw all bt the first, and to engraft upon that the resolution of the
hon. m ember for Liverpool, wi the exception of the iirst
tswo lines, EO that it wrould read thus:-
"That Sir J. MNeill and Colonel Tulloch ably fulfilled the duty intrusted to them of inquiring into the arrangement and management of the Commissariat Department; and that, considering the able services rendered by them as commissioners in the Crimea, and the testimonyin their favour of Her Majess Government, an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that some especial mark
of approbation be conferred apon them."
(Loud chees.) I confess that I entertain strong feelgs upon this sabject. It is by no means easy to find gentlemea who will make a roport which by implication affects persons of great standing and of high rank; and if you wish in future to have true and faithful reports you must show your appreciation of men who are 'dllig rather to encounter obloquy than to conced or gloss over that which they ought in duty to make known (loud cheers); and I must say that,
looling at the services which have been rendered by these gentlemen, it does not appear to me that they have received Justice at our hands. (Hear, hear. I again repeat that wo are not here to sit in judgment upon the Chelsea Bosad of Officers, but the question forns Lto eonslder is, ough not these commissioners, who had to dischargeo a most Meiicate, a most difficuit, and a mpt invidious duty, and who discharged that duty with the ttmost faithfulness and ability, to receive from the eountry some mark of aMobatiou ? (Cheers.)
Sir J. PAX GTON.-I agre generally with what has faller, from the right hon. gentleman the member for WVilts, but I am not quito sure that I agree with bim
Jiat a veil of oblivion ought to be cast over all the trans-
ictions of the campaign of 1854-5 ; bat, althoain, I hops and believe that those events will never be ftrgotten, I so far
agree with the right hon. gettleman as to consider that it is not advisable now to bring them un'aer the consideration ofthe Hose of Commons. There, an be no doubt as to the
sympathy entextained by the Horm e and bythe country for the sufferings of the Army, but, I am disposed to agree with my gallant friend that the events of that campaign should only bb;efeerd fo tQ . Stpurpeso of effectingcertain-hange&
I
in theomganization of oUrzmilita&ydepartments; butl take,
different view from him s to whither the services of tibe!3 gentlemen ought to receive a fuller measure of recogmtion thin they have received as yet, The question is one whlch this Hous, and, I believe, the country generally, regard *ith great interest. Sir J. M'eil and Colonel TUlloch were selected by Government at a moment of great anxiety to conduct a most delicate, a most difficult, and a most in. vidious inquiry, and I believe that no two functionariesever discharged a difficult duty with mnore abilSty or with mor3 honesty than they did. (Hear, hear.) When they published their report the Board of Officers at Chelsea was appointed to inquire into certain charges which it was alleged werO contained in it against certain officers holding a high position in the army. I have not the least intention of casting any censure upon that board; on the contrary, I heard with gi eat interest what fell from my gallant friend, and I am quite convinced, and I believe that the country is convinced, that the duties of that board were ably and bonourably discharged. My gallant friend has stated that it vas not the intention of that board to inquiwre into the conduct of Sir J. MrNeill and Colonel Tulloch; but, at the same time, they communicated to those gentlemen that they were at hberty to appear before them. I think that in that respect the Board of Officers acted with perfect fairness; but I must confess that, under all the circumstances of the case, I think thit Sir J. 'leill exercised a wise discretion in trusting to the opinion which had been privately expressed to him by the Government and not appearing before the board. Oclonel TUlloch adopted a different course, animated, I believe, by a. feeling highly becoming to him as an officer, but still I thirk that he I would better have consulted his own dignity if he had followed the exarnple of Sir J. 3rNeilL The right hon.
gentleman cpposite has borne testimony, and the Houe! responded to his statement, to the services of these gentlemen; and the question now before the House is whether those services have been adequately rccognized ? I will not enter into the rumours with regard to some supposed understaniding with Colonel Tuiloch before he went out, that higher military rank would be conferred upon him on his return. [Lord Palmerstonmade a gesture of dissent.]
I see that tho noble lord dissenht from that proposition, and I I am not prepared to say that there was any such understanding. After the language of the noble lord this evening I am not disposed to impute to him unwillingness to do justice to these gentlemen; but I must express my opinion, which I beheve is one very generally entertained, that the Government have not recognised their services with the promptitude or generosity, or to the extent which they ought to have done. (Hear, hear.) It is perfectly truo, as has been stated by my hon. friend behind me (Mr. Palk), that, on the part of the noble lord at the head of tho War Department, no public recognition of these services was made until, I beleve, a year after the report was presented, and certainly sic months after the appointment of the Chelsea Board; and, if I recollect rightly, it was not until this very se;son that the noble lord opposite made in Parliament any declaration of the approbation of Her Majesty's Govern. ment.
Lord PALMERSTON.-Last year.
Sir J. PAKINGTON.-I beg pardon; but, beyond that verbal recognition, no reward, no compensation has been given to these officors, and I heard this evening with very great regret the answer which was given by the noble lord to the question put to him by the hon. member for Liverpool (Er. J. Ewart). (Hear, hear.) Wben I saw that question on the paper r did most earnestly hopo that the hon. gentleman had some good reason for putting it, and I anxiously expected that the answer of tho noble lord would
have been different from what it was. Under thesecircum-1 stances I would join my right hon. friend the member for Wiltshire in pressing my hon. friend behind me (Mr. Palk) to alter the terms of his motion. I am not disposed to be a party to the unnecessary revival of painful questions with regard to the conduct of the war; but, on the subject now before the House-the claims of the commissioners-I am disposed to have a very clearopinion. I believe it would be inconsistent with the forms of the House for the hon. member for Liverpool to move the amendment of which he has given notice upon the motion of my hon. friend, which is itself an amendment, but I think the objects of both hon.
gentlemen wiU be answered if my hon. friend behind me | (ir. Palk) wil drop the paragraphs of hisresolution referring
to the conduct of the war, and add to his first paragraph' relating to Sir John M`NeiU and Colonel Tulloch the words of the amendment of the hon. member for LiverpooL
(Hear, bear.) If my hen. friend will adopt that course I I sball give him my vote.
Mr. J. EWART said that he had heard with great pain the answer given by the noble lord at the head of the Government to the question which he had put to him that evening. Be should certainly never have asked that question ha he not had strong reasons for believing that some proper mark of distinction would be conferred, at all events, upon Colonel TuUoch. The Crimean Commissioners undertook a most painful and arduous duty, and they discharged it in a manner which justified the confidenco which had been reposed in them by the Government, and entitled them tothe eternal gratitude of the country. (Rear, hear.) Far be it from him to say anything against those offlcers who were aluded to in the report. The judgment of the country was, he believed, against them, and that was sufli. cient. (Hear, hear.) He could not, however, help exprossing his deep regret that the distinguished men who undertook that arduous duty should have been so entirely passed over, aud that no proper recognition of their merits should have been made. He had hoped that the noble lord would have met this question in a different manner. He could assure him that there was a very strong feeling about it in the country, and that the people would not be satisfied until there had been made to these two gentlemen some proper recognition of the valuable services which they had ren-
dered. He entirely approved of the course which had been' suggested by the right hon. gentleman the member for Wiltshire (Mr. S. Herbert), and he hoped that, altered as that right hon. gentleman had suggested, the resolution would ba agreed to by the House. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. PALK said that if the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman the member for Wiltshire had not fullvycoin-
cided with his own opinions he should still have considered i it his duty to defer to the judgment of those who had much I better means of forming an opinion upon this subject than I he himself possessed. As it was, however, that concurrence did exist, and he, therefore, had no difficulty in acceding to thesuggestion which had beenmade. (Hear, hear.)
The amendment was then withdrawn, and the question was put by the Speaker in its amended form.
Two or three hon. members rose to address the House. but they were received with loud and general cries of "Divide," and "Question."
Lord BALILERSTON.-I had hoped to have had a moro decided expression of the opinions and feelings of the House upon the proposal of my right hon. friend, but if I am to infer from the calls for a division that the feeling of the House is decidedly in its favour (cheers) I shal noo oppose it. I have no wish to stand between the generous feelings of this House and the accomplishment of its wishes. Nobody more heartily desires than I do that the services of these two gentlemen should be recognized. I did certainly think that the offer made to them was the more natural and appropriate acknowledgment of services of that description; but, at the same time, if the House is of a different opinion I for one shall not go to a division. (Cheers.)
The question was then put, and the resolution, as amnended, was agreed to without a division.
PRO MOTION FROM THE BA-WKS.
Sir J. FERGUSSON rose to call the attention of the House to the position of the non-commissioned officers who had received commissions in the army during the late war. The hon. member said that as the session wuas so near its conelusion he should not go into this question so fully as he had intended to do. He would only state the facts, and he trusted that before Parliament met again some steps would be takea to remedy the grievances to which he was about to call attention. When, during the late war, commiesions were first offered to non-commissioned officers of regiments serving at the seat of war great difficulty was experienced in finding men who would accept them, and in the battalion with which he (Sir J. Fergasson) served one commission wsJ offered to and refused by eight non-commissioned officers.
As the war went on, and many of the men who ! had, received commiadons rose in their regiment3 and obtained adjutancies and quartermasterships. this difficulty diminished and many non-commissioned officers accepted commissions in different regiments. The greatest benefit had accrued to the service by non-commissioned officers accepting commissions, because, where a
regiment had lost a large number of its officers and men i andhad to be filled up by recruits, it was important to have j experienced men to lead it in the field. But when peace was res'ored these men were left in a worse position than the one they had occupied as non-commissioned officers, fozr
they then lost their field allowances, and the officers r- I turned to their more expensive style of living in barracks on home service. Thus, men who had been accnstomed to frugal habits, and to have their rations supplied them at a
very moderate rato by the Government, found themselves I
oblgedI to live on the,same scaeas o ffisclers whoenere t
service with large private fortupes. Moreover, the soldiers
who had been promoted from the ranks had often families to support, which was seldom the case with the junilor otficerg having private means; and the consequence was, that the former had to struggle with poverty to, maintain themsdves as gentlemen. Promotion from the ranks had
hitherto been so rare that no provlsion had been miade for the contingency which had arisen of so many officers being in this situation. There was a great difference between the py of non-commissioned officers and that of the junior omcers to whomho had referred. A sergeant'sclothin was given tohim, and the whole cost of a non-co oned
officer's rations was 6s. 6d. per week, while his pay wa, 1s- 7d.; consequently, he had maore than Ss. left to spen
upon his family, or toplac in the savings bank ; and t4 accounts of the regimeutal svings bans showed how largely the non-commis ioned officers availed themselve of the facilities thus afforded them for sving. On tho other hand An ensipn's pay at 5s. a-day w-as U. 13s..per weeI4 from wbich had to be deducted, at the lowest CDMpo - taion, 4s. a-day for mess expenss, leaving hin only To. with which to provide himself with clothing, pay a servant, and defray every subscription which he was compUelle to make to his regiment. A further heavy expense to which these officers were put was t'he cost of remo'vizg their wives and families when their regimnents verc. ordoerei to the colnime,s, or only from one home statiopAto another. How' then, was it viossible for a non-eommisA~onea officeu who htd receved proiaotion, even with the savings he-had accuma.' lated -while In the ranks, to lay oy any money, or evetn to maintain. his family in deoiw. -with his present rate Of pay?2 Nobody, had shown "a 'grete eet In this clasq of persons than the Alstir,guisSed individual now at the. kesd of the HorsQ (UArs, and who had rescued dsscr;ip

whc a greatly reduoed by the war. and afterwards ,fillEd up by recruiits fr;,m home, and which he disciplined and brought to as high a state of *eiciency as it originally displayem This offier, however, from the difficulties just pointed ott beingunabloto remove his fatnily to our Eastern empire, whither his regiment had been ordered, was obliged to quit the service and sacrifice all his prospecta of further distinction. Luckily this man was provided for by his Royal Highness in the way above described; but the country, .fter inducing a man to accept a commission, and benefiting by his services, ought not to leave him in want. The remedy he would suggest was that nobody should be promoted from the ranks except those whom long and meritorious services had entitled to high reward. Comminons ought to have attaehed to them the means of maintaining the position they conferredi and being given in exceptional cases, and not for mere disinguished service and allntry-which might be the act of a moment-care should be taken that those obtaining them were not losers by their promnotion. The rule shorld bo adopted which applied to other services, where men raised from the rark-s receivednod scrvice pensionn and it was aatonishinghow little would be sufficient-. say 5O a-year-to enable a mnan to sustain his higher rank without suffering materially by it. Promotion rom the ranks of the army at present entirely failed in its object. Thoe who had gained it were allowed at the close of the war to sell their commissions. To an ensign, however, this only produced 4501, which would not place the recipient in as good a position as a no -commissionedo&clr retiringafter21years'service. The latter was entitledto 2s.6d. a-day pension, with ls. more, by regimental regulation if he was in the Guards; whereas, all that the prce of an ensign's commission would yield if invested was only 1S8, per annum. Having himself served several years in the army, and known many officers to be promoted from the rAnks who were exellent and useful men in their regiments and men deserving of allthe rowardsthathad beenbestowed npon them, he could not help bringing this subject forward before the present Parliament expired, feeling strongly that, however desirable it might be to reduce the expense of the army in time of peace, tke ery last way in which they should practi economy was by ctting down the hardly earned recompence of those who had struggled through a long period of meritorious service to the envied position of a commission in Her Majesty's sernice. (Hear, hear.)
ARIMY ESTIMATES.
The House then went into Committee of Supply, when
Mr. PEEL rose and said that, in proceeding with the motion which stood in his name on the subject of the army estimates, it was not his intention, as the committee were aware, to invite them to agree to the whole of the sums which the Government computed would be required to carry on the service of the army throughout the ensuing financial year. Having regard to the circumstances in ,which the Government and the House were placed, and folloving the precedent set in the case of the navy estimates, it would be snfficient if the committee voted money enough to cover the payments likely to fall due in the courso of the next four months. As the majorpartof each voto would have to be submitted to the ensuing Parliament, and as even the money now to bo voted on account would have to he re-voted in the sacceeding House of Commons, he should best consult the convenienoe of the committee by not anticipating the discussions and explanations which were sure to arise when the estimates were again brought forward hereafter, and by abstaining, therefore, from now entering into any deails with regard to the various items and services comprised in those estimates. With respect, however, to the number of men, which formed the first vote, he was under the necessity of pursuing a different course. The number of men which he should propose to ask the committee to sanction for the ensuing year was 126,796. Last year the number voted was 246,716, so that there was a reduction this year in round numbers of 120,000 men. The reduction in the Guards and infantry was 78,510, the number proposed this year being 84,063 against 162,573 voted last year. This reduction was effected byvoting a diminution of the rank and file of the various regiments. La3t year the average strength of the regiments in the Crimea was 2,000 men, and the average strength of aU other regiments of thepine, except those in the East Indies, was 1,200 men. This year the average strength of each regiment, not roantin3 those in the East lndies, would bo 840 men. m the cavalry there would be a reduction of 7,495 men, 9,325 men being asked this year, against 16,820 voted last year. This reduction was efectei by diminishing the number of troops in each regimentfrom eight to six, and the number of men in each regiment from 640 to 350. In the artillry and en
neers there was a reduction of from 28,221 of aU raks to 21,924, and in the military train and hospital corps there was a reduction of S,191 men. The Foreign Legion, consi4ing of 21,719 men, which had been disbanded in the course of last autumn, completed the total of the reduction. No doubt, it would be asked whether a real reduction had been effected during the last 12 months to tho extent of 120,000 men ? The numbers proposed this year were certainly less by 120,000 men than the numbers voted last year, but it did not follow that that nuniber of effective men had been discharged in tho course of the year. In the case of the Foreign Legion and the Iand Transport Corps 30,000 men had been discharged, and that left a reauction of JO,000 to be accounted for. The number which was voted last year for the Guards and cavalry wvas 173,000, but the effective force nover reaUy reached that strength The army was at its strongest about last April, and at that time it numbered 129,857 men, which was 43,650 below the establishment vote. This left a reduction to bo effected of 42,35a men. Up th the lst of February in this year 19,594 men had been discharged, and two regiments of cavalry, numbering 1,361 men, which had been brought from Iudia to the Crimea, had been replaced on the Indian establishment. In addition to these it was anticipated that between the 1st of Fcbruary and tho commeRcement of the ensuin financial year between 10,000 and 12,000 men would be discharged from various causes, and there would then remain about 9,000 men to be reduced. From a return which had been made up of the annual diminution of the army in time of peaco for the 10 years ending 1853 it appeared that, upon the average strength of the infantry and cavalry during those 10 years, which was 121,532 men, there was an annual loss from deaths, discharges, and desertions of 12,700 men, or rather more than 1,000 men a- month. If the army, therefore, were at once to be reduced to the strength voted by Parliament, it would have to be kept up to that strength by recruiting to the amount of 1,030 men a-month; but, as this was an expensive precess, it was proposed to suspenad recruiting for the present, and to kee
these 9,0 0 men as a sort of reserve on which to draw To fill ap the ordinary loes, These men would in this manner be. absorbed in from six to nine months; after that, of course, recruiting would have to be resorted to to keep up tho army at the strength voted by Parliament. As to the Axrtilery and Engineers, their present numbers only exceeded the strength proposed to be voted by Parliament by about 2,000 men, and these would be discharged before the commencement of the financial year. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving that the number of men for the ensuing financial year be 126,796.
3tr. STAFFOItD expressed his regret that nothing had yet been done to carry out the recommendations of the committee which sat last year in reference to the medical officers of the army. Their position in the army remained now exactly as it was when the war broke out, although the present Government, when it came into office had given a distinct assurance that the department shoaid bo completely revised. Under the Government of the noble lord the army in the Crimea had been brought into a state of the highest efficiency, the comfort and health of the soldiers had been promoted in every way, but now that other topics had taken possession of the public mind he was afraid that tho Government might put off army medical reform on the score of economy. The state of suspense in which the Army Medical Department had been kept for nearly two years had created among them a feeling of disappointment, vexation, and a disinllnation to continue in the service; and they desired to be told one thing or the other, -either that the Government were going to do something for thom or nothing. If the bravery of the British soldier, his fortitude, discipline, and good conduct rendered his lifo and comfort very precious, and if his lifo was mado stiU more valuablo by the impossibiity of filling u gaps in the ranks proceeding from death by conscription, then he called upon the House, by the remembrance of the Crimean difficulties and tho recollection of the Crimean glories, to see that the care of the soldier's life was not left to a class, into which the rcale of pay and position obtained were not calculated to attract young men of the greatest eminence and promise, while, at the same time, the sAst India Company, the largeo steam-packet establishments, the requirements of the colonies and of an increasing population, drewr from the army medical profession many men of ability. The time had .ome when he must protest against any further proorastiation onthoa1art of the Government, anil he hoped tho Eovornmcnt would stato distinctly their intentionss with regard to the Army Medical Department.
Sir D. L.EVANS said, that no department hadbeen more Ixposed to difficulty in the Crimea than the Medical Dapartnent of the army, and he trusted that when the army estinates came before the next Parliament some general statenent would be made in reference to that department. For fhe sake of the efficiency of the army before the enemy it waa important that tho utmost attention should be paid to die state of the Medical Department. In reference to enother department-the Conmissaria,t the discussion
Prhich had taken place had brought to tho painful recolleo. "on of the Eouse that that branch had been almost entirely aeglected before the recent. war. Publin attention bad beon drawn to this sub*ct very mnch, and he had eon in an extromely sensible work, published by a Comnissariat Officer, the sugjeation that, instead of being a yvil department, the Commissarke, with the exception of ffie accountant branch,ahouldbo altogeter military. Suh, wAs the case in India, and in respect to his divisiol in the Crimea great advantago waa dewived from the assistance fon DomMLeaxriat purp*ges of two or three mUitary oftmr, who, however, eould not continue that aid when,i tlir Alivsion eame before the enemy. He ventuted, to hope that th. Government would tako this polnt under consideration before tho meeting of nowt Plrlia. zimer.t. With resect to the Transport Corpn it. seemed oF.jection&ble that that should be totally iidendent of
ter Vorcq siat, for t hat the Commidaet we to wsthouh the Transport Corps be did uet how. He thouRwt that the case ot the non cormmysied officerst wht wad reeived commissions and wersow redCnsced calle
for liberal consideration. With respecthiO to t number oe men requited for the army, he detemed it osi the duty of the executive Government to propse thu arlount en their
own responsibility. IIe rememubered it -5 statedat the beginning of the tloastwar tthatbuif *oE a'yC tas nsicEnt theoexecutive Government. HE a'nede to suh astatno the GOvernmeinttas.ytai*bclenm lfQ thew aryen

w;son was whether due economy had beea observei j inxtit.deportnmcts EHo was afraid there had been 9o9!1 c xtrava, 'toe with respectto the Staff, bttt the only mode of reconciling etonomy with efficiency was by restricting alt dispensable v Irvices. He hoped this point would receier the consideratm on of the Government, and that measst-ei would be taken for improving tho Commissariat Dapa t- mcnt, which he tl ought was not in a satisfactory stae.
Sir J F.RGUSLON observod, that the committea of i which he was a mem. ber had rcoommended that an extra-
assistsnt surgeon shoult1 be Xppointed to every regiment, for it was found that, as the -e was only one assistant-surgeon to each regiment, not only *. s it impos.ible for the surgeon and his assistant to discharlse their duties efficiently, but those officers were unable to obtain leave of absence. If from sickness or any other Pressing causo the medica! officers were compelled to absent L hemselves from their red
ments for any length of time, ti, ey were obliged at their own cost, to rorde for the modica charge of the troop duning their absence. He believed the Duke of Cambridge hid expressed a decided opinion that an extra assistantnurgeon should be appointod to every regiment, and that rnedical officers ought to receive leavo of absence oa, tbsame scale or the other offioers. At the commeneement of the late war there was no department of the army in which there was so marked a deficiency as the Medical Department. Aftr the battlo of thoe Am the wounded remained on the field for at least 24 hours before theyreceiven medical attention, owing to the want of a sufficient number of mnedical officers. ie thought that, in Whatever depirtments of the army reductions were effected, there ought to be no diminution in the number of regimental medical ,officers.
Colonel NORTH said, he was a member of the committea referred to by the hon. baronet, which was most fairly constituted, and which had recommended an increase of pay to medical officers of the rmy; and he hoped the UnderSecretary for War would be enabled, when the report of rupply was brought up, to state whether the Government intended to take any steps to carry out the recommendas. tions of the committee with regard to a most meritorious class of officers of the army.
Mr. PEEL could assure the committee that the state of tho Medical Department of the army continued to receive the attention of tho Government. He had himself been a member of the committee, but he did not remember that they recommended the employment of an increased number of medical offioers. If that were the case, however, the Government had carriod out their recommend4tion - for there had not only been an increase in the number oi surgeons attached to infantry regiments, but there had also
on a very large increase in the medical staff. Comrin the expenditure for thbe medical staff of Great Britain anc Irland in 1852, 1853, and 1854, with what it was at presnt, it would be found there had been an increase amounting to about 40,000. a-year. The bon. and gallant general (Sir D. L. Evans) had rtated, that although the number of mnfaDtr was now less than it was before the war, the expenditure for that branch of the service had increased. There was undoubtedly an Increased charge, whic'a w!s attributable to the fact that, although the number of rank and file was less than in 1852 and 1853, a larger number of officrs and non-commissioned officers wtS retained, in consequence of the change in the conistitution and organiztion of me,fmentz. Before the late war each regiment consisted of ong10 companies, but in 1854, on the proposition of the rnght hon. member for South Wilts (Mr. S. Elerbert) the number of companies in each regiment was increoe;
from 10 to 12. The right hon. gentleman urged that that should be a permanent increase, andthe recommendationwar concurred in by the late Mr. Hume. The retention of the extra companies and the additions to the Ridle Corps occasioned the increased expenditure to which the gallant officer referred.
Mr. STAFFORD said, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Peel) hbd not given an answer to his question. Hle had not stated what were the Intentions of tho Government with regard to the Medical Department of the Army.
Sir W. CODRINGTON was glad to hear that the reductions of the army would be carried out in such a manner as not to deprive the country of the services of good and established soldiers. Considerablo reductions had becn effected since tho war, bat the men discharged were generally those of weak health, of indifferent character, or whose term of service had nearly expired. He had feared that they were also going to discharge some 8,000 or 9,000 men whom he regarded as the pith of the army, but ho was glad to hear that the Government would not adopt such a step without further consideration. With regard to the regimental medical officers, he could assure the committee that they were not adequately rewarded for their services. He knew many of them ;who had served during tho whole wvar with the army in the East, who had encountered what he might term all the medical difficulties besides the war difficulties, who had grappled with the cholera in Bulgaria, who had subsequently attended the army in the Crmea, who had discharged arduous daties on battlefields and in the trenches, but who now remained at home without reward, promotion, or distinction of any sort. (Hear, hear.) He wished strongly to impress upon the Government tbe importance of providing an efficient military train. If during the war with Russia there was one corps whose deficiency was commented on more strongly than another, it was the absenco of a land tiansport and military train. The evils which befell tho army in the Crimea were all at-. tributable to an entiro want of any organization of a military train. He was afraid that this corps were to be reduced too low in strength, for a force of 1,200 men with an armyinx the field would be about enough for one division,-that was, for 5,000 or 6,000 men. He supposed that some reduction was necessary, in consequence of the pressure put upn the Government by the ouse of Commons, which looked with an evil eye upon military expenditure. These 1,200 men would be, he supposed, spltup a.nong different camps of instruction. He trusted that they would oe called upon to discharge not only tho minorpart of their duty, such as carting gravel, but that they would be exercised in carrying ammunition, whi which on ht to bo handy, and ambulance, which ought to be close. atters ought to be so arnged that the milita trains shonld be practised in marca g in the camps to which they were attached with these articles. If they were accustomed to march with the brigade, the regiment, or the division to which they r a hey would know here they ought to be in a diviwon, and they would learn how to oo after their own tents and their horses. It was not by separating them, but by bringing them together, that they would be made efficient. All the evils of the first winter iL the Crimea were traced to the absence of an efficient lardI transport, accustomed to military drill, and knowing their horses and their duties in support of regiments. The mili. tary train should bo kept up, and whether an expeditiot were small or large it ought not to go out without its land transport corps. Of course, if the war 9d. were taken off roductions in the expenditure must be,made. An enormous reduction was taking place in the factories at Woolwich, and gre-%t misery and distress were inevitablo when as many as 5,000 workmen were discharged from one (-overnment ar(senal, some of whom had been forthree yearsandupwards in the Government service. He thought it would bo worthy the consideration of the Government-whether some facilites for emigration might not be fairly offered to those labourers and artisans who wrere thrown out of gwork, not from anuy fault of theirs, but from a cessation of employment it consequence of the peace. uany of these persons had no resourco but the parish, and it was a questiox wfhether the Government, which had so great an extent ot frontage and roads contiguous to its establishments, shouldc not contribute something either to the maintenance of the roads or towards the poor-rates of a parish so-situated. At .resent thero was a great pressure, from these circumstances, upon the rates of the borough-which he had the honour to represent.
The vote was then put and agreed to.
On the question that the sum of 1j407,000l. be granted on. account, for pay and mony allowances for HIer Majesty's land fores at home and abroad for the first four months of the ensuing financial year,
Sir D. L. EVANS said that the expenditure for staff pay and allowances was very high and if ho had-the honour of a seat in tho next Parliament he should bring the subjectbefore the House. In the field a general could scarcely have too many aides-de-camp, if they were efficient, but at homo he did not think that any general officer required more thau onO aide-de-camp.
Mr. MACGREGOT. hoped that the attention of the Government would be given to the position in which a noncommissioned officer. woe placed when he received a-commission. He kne a-case where a distinguished soldier had refused his promotinon account of the pecuniary positiorL in which ho would have been placed by accepting a com. mimsdon.
M1r. M. CHA?3BES said the present regimental-arrange. ments were such that the expenses were more than any officer could afford who had no private resources. The only alternative for non-commissIoned officers who were pro. mated for dis5indshed services was retirexent, or assist, anee from the Governmenti. He thought the subject re. qulired immediate attention.
General CaDRINGTGN. asked whether ib wvs consistent with the character of this-country that son-commisaionedE officers pr^omuoted to commissions should be in a woaseposi. tion than, before they we-re promoted.

'Was no mew expense, but an expense which had been cheer. fully and wiUingly defrayed for many year The yeomanry cavalfy had been caUed out for duty more or lew every year since 1818. The present estimate was 7,2001. for the ataff and 21,5001. for contingent allowances, making together 28,700!. The whole expense in former yearsvws,000?. Therefore the raving to the country was only 60,000., derived from the two items of 22,000o. for clothing and 38,OM0. for permanent duty. Was it worth while to save 60,0001. at the expense of ianuri i the efficienoy and imang the seal ofa force which the a Government could not deny had from time to time rendered important servies to the country? In 12m and in 1 the Government of the day tried to economize by putting an end to the yoomanry ca , and the result in both cases was that they were sp y obliged to retrace their steps, and to restore that force in many resPects to greater strength than before. He was afraid that if the yeomanry were not called out for the next two years the Government would take advanthe of that circumstance, and when the estion came to be discussed in 1859 would maintain that hmere Wa no loner any occasion for their services. If the Government tou htth st in consequence of the msore general esblishmaent of an improved police, the yeomnre force had become obeelete he could understand their proposition; but such was not the 0a d upon which they recommendedy their measure tothe trfouse anc for his own part, while he did not deny that an Improved oiorce might lessen the demand for military assistance in aid ao the civil power, he was not prepared to admit that the servics of the yeomanry would not be reqaired hereafter to put down riots in the more populous districts of the country. There was another point which he wlshed to no-ice before he concluded The Propositino the Government, whether they the it or oth would amount to a breach of faith with the e Officers Of Yeomanry regimaents.

Mr. B. COCHRANE urged the claims of the two regiments of yeomanry in Lanarkshire. At the present emoment there was only one regiment of recvlars in Glasgow, and if, as reported, it was the intention of Governhent to 'withdraw it, and at the same timne not to calu out the yeomanry for permanent duty, the whole military force in Lanarkshire would consist of two or three 'troops of horse atilery. Now, Lanarthire contained a wopulation of nearly 700,000 n aheyeo and it was of the utmost importance that there saruldb a proper mifitsry force at hand to aid the civil power in cases of emergency. in a rcnt return it was stated that one of the local yeom~anry regiments had never been called upon to assst the civil power, wheream so recently as last year it was on duty for two months in aid of the civil service.

upwards of 40 years in the yeomanry, that if the
yeomanry were not to be caled out regularly for train-
ing of some deesription the efficiency of the corps and the ;service would be materially deteriorated, and it had better be dispensed with altogether than be dealt with in such a manner. With respect to clothing, he (Mr. Deedes) was -one of tlbse commanding officers of yeomnnry wholaboured under heavy responsibility. In 1880 the regiment to which he originalU elo onge, and in which he served as major, was raised, and in 1837 two troops of it were reduced. Be then became the commander of the regiment In 1837 it was in -a very effiient state, but iquever recovered the reduction wrhich then took p le It dwindled dow n until, in 1853, -only two troops remained, which he still commanded.

He was compelled to clothe the whole regiment, and the hardship of the case was that he had no advance made to him whatever in respect of the two troops whiohhaa belongedtothe oldestablishment. The conse qee was that he was ldft personally responsible for a con drabl.e amount, and he asked whether this was a state of things which ought to he allowed to continue.

We ad laid ou upwars of 106comece in two ears upon Enfield, and he believed that not one single rausket lead yet been sent out from that establishment. (Hear, bear.)
M[r. PEEL said that it was not surprising that no com-. pleted mutskets had been turned out by the establishment, because the building was only commenced in the autumn of 1855, and of course some time was occupid in completing It and in fitting it with machinery. ough no complete mauskets, had yet been turned out, parts of the arm had been made in considerable quantities; and now that the machinery for maaking the barrels had been completed, there would be no difficulty in finishing them, and he believed that in the course of the present year as masny as 40,000 rifles would be manufactured at Enfield. (Hear, hear.) He was not informed with respect to the charge of entidng men away from private eaploners in the neighbourhood ot Birmingham; but he would cause inquiry into the subject,
Mr. MUcNTZ said that the manufactory at Enfeld had been in every way a deception. In the first place, a better article would never be manufactured there than was sup. plied by the trade in the next place, a mnuch larger an of money had been Lid oudt thanwas contemplateed, with no advantage to the State; -and lastly, the arms manufactured there would, he believed, cost miore than they might be bought for. 'He begged to ask whether, and at what period (the manufactory at Enfield being now complete), the hon. gentleman would furnish an estmpate as to th quantity of arms produced, and their cost? (Hear.)
Mr. NEWDEGATE trusted the commaittee would bear in mind that there had been a distinct pledge given that the details of the expenditure at this estabuslinent should be furnished as soon as it was in working order. He now understood the manuiactory to be in that state, and it was only fair that, as the establishment competed with the manufacturers at Birmingham, a comparison should be drawn between the relative cost of the weapons furnished by each, so that hon. members should be enabled to judge from correct dcta whiether the Governmnent were suppliedI more cheaply fromEnfe than by thetrade. There was another point tvowhichbe wished to call the hon. gentlemWan attention. Ho long were the Government to continxue the emaployment of three or four staffs of the best BTirmigham workmen in instructing foreigners to mnake arms after the patterns adopted by this country? It was well known that he had been decided advocate of protection, hut surely it was something mnore than free trade to devote public money in instructing foreigners to compete in the manufacture of aran with the trade of this country.
Mr. PEEL said that if the hon. member for Birmingham Mr. Muntz) would move for areturn of the entire expenditure at Enfield he should be quite ready to grant the fullest information on the subject. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the manufacture of arms upon the continent, it was the fact that during the war contracts to a considerable extent were entered into for the supply of rifles from Liege and other places. In 'he present estimates no provision was made for entering into any new contracts on the continent or in America, but only for payments arising out of contracts not yet expired.
Mr. COWAN calledattention to the item of "lodging money for men quartered on the inhabitants of Scotland," from which he inferred that the system of billeting soldiers in Scotland, upon which the House had already pronounced a tolerably emphatic condemnation, was not yet at an end. The noble lord at the head of the Government had assured him that a will and a way should be found to do away with this miserable practice, and he had also understood from the hon. gentleman that an alteration in the Billeting Act would be proposed. He should be glad to know what the people of Scotland were to expect on this subject ? Money was voted for feeding and clothing our gallant troops, and he could not understand why they should not also be provided with comfortable quarters. He believed that 1id. per night was allowed for their lodging, but what kind of accommodation could be expected for that miserable pittance ?
Mr. A. HASTIE complained also of the billeting system in Scotland. People had no objection to troops on the march being billeted upon them, ut it was hard that they should be saddled with troops permanently quartered upon them.
Mr. PEEL was understood to say that a provision would be introduced into the Mutiny Bill to remedy the existing system.
Sir C. NAPIER observed that there was an amount of 84,5271. for officers of the Manufacturing Department, but he did not see any provision for the pay of the men.
Mr. PEEL explained that the salaries of of ficers in the Manufacturing Department amounted to 19,1951., and the remainder of the sum referred to by the gallant admiral was
Eor n t Store Department. The provnsion for the men would be found in another vote.
In answer to Mr. He?nalo,
Mr. PEEL stated that 25,000 riles of the pattern of 1853 would be delivered from the continent dureng the year, and while the existig contracts were being carried on the coi
mittee of officers to superintend them would be maintained, but there was no provision in the present estimate for enterng into any newv contract.
The vote wras then agreed to, as was also a vote of L1,0001., r f the payment of workmen, labourers, and 2rtiiicers.
The followingvotes on account were also agreed to140,0001, for clothing, necessaries, sc.

RETIREMENT OF THE SPEAKER.
MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN.
Lord PALMERSTON.--Mr. Speaker, I have to acquaint this House that their address of Tuesday last to Her Majesty, praying that Her Majesty would be graciously pleased to confer some signal mark of her Royal favour upon the Right Hon. Charles Shaw Lefevre, the Speaker of this House, for the great and eminent services which he has performed to his country during the long and Important period in which he has with such distinguished ability and integrity presided in the chair of this House, and assuring Her Majesty that this House wMil make good every expense which Her Majesty may think proper to be incurred on that account, has been presented to Her Majesty, and that Her Majesty has been pleased to receive the same graciously, and has commanded me to acquaint this House that Her Majesty desires, in compliance with the wishes of her faithful Commons, to confer upon the Bighb Hon. Charles Shaw Lefevre some signal mark of her Royal favour; but, as the same cannot be effectuaUy granted and secured without the concurrenoe of Parliament, Her Majesty recommends to the House of Commons the appliance of suoh measures as may be necessary for the accomplishment of this purpose. (Loud cheers.) I move that this House do resolve itself into a committee of the vwhole House to-morrow, to take into consideration Her Majeety's gracious message.
The motion was unanimously agreed to.
WAYS AND MEANS.
The House went into Committee of Ways and Means, and a vote of 21,049,7001. Exchequer-biUs for the service of the year 1857 was agreed to.
INCOME-TAX BILL.
Iu moving the third reading of this Bill,
The CHANCELLOP of the EXCHEQUER said that the hon. member for Southwark (Mr. A. Pellatt) had on a previous evening mentioned the case of a Mrs. Smith, in which he thought the Commissioners of Tll and Revenue had acted with some harshness. As these very meritorious functionaries had very delicate, difficult, and not very popular duties to discharge, be hoped the House would listen to an explanation which he had received from Mr. Pressly, the Chrman of the Board of Inland Revonue and which he would rcad. That statement was as fol-
"On the 4th of February last Mm Smith attended at this office, and stated that a levy had been made upon her goods for 11. Is., due from her late husband for income-tax.
t3he represented herself to be in great distress, and, without waiting even for a report of the facts from the surveyor of
the district, I gave a written direction to that officer that the levy should he immediately withdrawn without any expense to the party. To avoid any delay, this order was delivered into MIrs. Smith's owvn hands, with directions to
carry it immediately to the surveyor of the district, and is. wasS given to her to pay her omr,bbssfare.The order was accordingly delivered to the surveyor, and he on the same day (hem 4th of February) reported to me that he bad in. structed tlo collector to wihvthdraw the levy; adt app ear from Mrs. Smith's own letter to Ar. Ae ey PeeU a tt, dated
the 12th of February, that this wassdode. The sarveyor, in his report on t , s tate h he bevd the levy had ben mad ith a t o the broker's o wn Profit, andu that he would take care and make a fitting re pres en
of the facts to the commissioners of the distraet I may mention that the arrear in question arose from a return of profits made by the husband of Mrs. Smith before he died as a dealer in hats; and, as he held the situation of a letter sorter in the General Boat-office up to the time of his death, at a salary of 901. ayear, making, with profits of trade, upe wrards of 1001. a-year, the arrear wfas clearly due from him. At the same time, having died leaving bin widowr in great
distress, wre should, upon a representation of the facts, have abstained from enforcing the tax, and we did all weeccould d
the verymoment the case was brought before us. The woman's complain t is that she was put to some expense for the m an's keep while In ssn I have taken the neece. sary steps for ascertaining this amount, and will do my beat to compel the colector, under the c ircumstances, to reimburse Mrs. S mith. I my mention that the c ollector is not an officer of this department, but appointed by the district ommisesoners.
esCffARLS PRxsSLY, "Inland Revenue BoArd, March 122.
He thought that after that statement the House would be of opinion that no unnecessary sever ity was exercised by the Commissioners of Inland R evenue ; but that, on the 0ontrAry, Whoe th e rcuinstPance were brought to their
notle they behaved towards two is unfortunto widlow with g 0t consideration. (Hasr ear.) The right hon. gentle toan concluded by moving the third reding of the Bll
Admiral PECEELL add that having had to represent the cirtmaetanes of a case onMewhat similar hdi this at Somerset-house, he could bear testimony to the courteous, zealous, and kindly disposition of Mr. Presly, who did honour to the Government under wbech he served.

mr. L. EYWOa TH said that an income and property tax was the most just and least in urious to the obest interests of the country that could be devised It was true that schedule D was objfctionable, but it must be remem. bored that the portion of the tax raised under that schedule was only as 4,000,0004.tol16,000,0001. Of those 4,000,000
2,ODO, o0. were taken from the profits of joint-stoKWcompanes railways, &c., in the case of which there could be no deoe tio ad no inequality, while of the remaining 2,OCO, 00'0,1',09.001OOwas equally protected from those evils by being levied upon the incomneg of various officers whose salaries were well ascer tained and well known. Surely the Government could make such arrange. meutsawith regaxdto theremainingl,000000O4asto render tb
tax acceptable to all parties. He would earnestly request the House not to lose sight of this imp ortant mnode of taxation. He regretted that the 9d. shoul have been ta'ken off, because had it been continued they might have takea off 12,000,000,. of indirect taxes and thus have relieved our trade to an extent which wudhV nd h hl
coutr flmihin ad rosperous.Ifi were objected thtb hoaoistino indirect taxes and the substitution of an snconie-tax the wvorking elasses would escape all taxation, his reply was that we might continue the taxes upon
sirits and tobacco, the duty upon which, amounting to TW 0,01 per annmn, was paid~principally by the working classes, and was quite a sufficient sum to be contributed to the revenue by that portion of the community.
Mr. KUNTZ wished to say, as it was just possble that that might be the last timse he should have the honour of addressing the House (a laugh), that he did not object to an. income-tax per- se. On the contrary, he believed such a tax, if well reguilated, was the best that could be imposed. Anybody who thought this tax would be abolished, according to the plan of l8-3, at the end of three years -a f~huggilg0 lezdelusion that wouldbherudely dispelled; frhn 6came round, if they had not previously readjusted the impost, they would have no alternative but either to re-enact it in its present most vexatious shape or revert to the systemn of taxing the necessaries of life. Tere could be no difficulty in maending the tax: and making it equitable, and even agreeable (a laugh); and nothing could be more absurd tbhan to fold t eir arms and say the thing was impossible, in Boston (United States) the system prevailed of assessing every maan according to his means, and if the taxpayer objected to the amount p laed against his name he was put -upon his oath, and the ncome to which he positively swore was the one for which he was charged. That system entailed no difficulty, injustice, or dissatisfaction.
The Bill was then readl a thirdltimi aP AnA "-
EXTRAPAROCHIAL PLACES BfLL. On the motion for the third reading of this Bi,
Sir J. PAXKINGTON asked whether he was to undertand the principle of the measure to be that no property on the ground of its being extraparochial, should escape the fair burdens for the support of its own poorto which, under thel Poor Law system of this country, property otherwise situated was at present liable? In many parts of the country extreme hardship and difficulty had arisen from extraparochial districts being unable to levy poor-ratesand if the object of this Bill was to remedy that evil he should cordially concur in its adoption.
W.i BOUVERIE said that the right hon. gentleman had coreti stated the scope of the measure, which simply decl1re that all property of the same character should be called upon to relieve the destitution arising within its own boundaries.
Sir G. PECHELL complained that the BiU had been hurried on before its provisions were properly understood, and pointed out some instances in which individual proprietors who would be affected by it, apprehended that Ft would operate injuriously upon their interests.

POOBs IWW Ms)rCA XnRJBoB AsSoCtroN.-An aggregate meeting of medical students was held last night at St. Martin's-hall, Mr. Layard, M.P., in the cbair. In addressing the meeting, the chairman said he considered the question not a professional, but an economical one in which all classes were interested. By the present system medical men were great losers, ratepayers had to pay an increased taxation, and many persons made themselves paupers for the sake of obtaining medical relief. The whole question resolved itself into one argument,whether the members of the medical profession were properly remunerated for the services they renderedand it had been decided by the Poor Law Boara on two occasions, in 1829 and 1847, that medical men were not sufficiently paid for their services when employed by the boards of Poor Law guardians. He thought the movement a great but moderate one, and would afford it all the ssistance in Parliament which lay in his power. A report, read by lMr. G. Evans Earr, honorary secretary, entered into a statement of the endeavours of Poor Law guardians to be continuall reducing the salaries of their medical officers, and of the efforts repeatedly made by the profession at meetings held in the London and provincial medical schools and elsewhere to procure an adequate rate of payment, and no doubt was entertained but that the matter would be set right by the public when it became acquainted with the injunous effects resulting from the present system, not only to the profession, but the suffering poor. A number of resolutions (no less than eieht), spoken to chiefly by medical students of the various hospitals in London, and from Manchester, Bristol, and York, were unanimously passed. The sub. stance of the first four of these resolutions was as follows - That reform was caUed for in the Poor Law medical reiief system, as, in the first place, it injured the efficiency of relief by crippling the resources, limiting the powers, and lowerinng the standard of skill among the administrators of that relief; that the remuneration of the medical mnen employed was inadequate, and the supervision of their labours improperly referred to unprofessional persons * and that the grievances set forth closely touched the medical care and wellbeing of the suffering poor. The last four resolutions were, that the delegates obtain petitions dgned by all the students in England and have them presented to Parliment, and that thanks be given to Mr. Groffin for initiating the movement, and to the chairman for his kindness in iiresiding. Among the members of the profession connected with the metropolitan hoBpitals who were present, but who took no part in thoproceedg, were Dr. Hare and Pro. fessor Quain, of University College; Messrs. WWhlnnie and Holmes Coote, of St. Bartholomew's - Dr. Fraser and 3r. Critchett, of the London Hospital3 15r. O'Connor of the Roy,al Free Hospital - Mr. Spencer Smith, of St.Mrys Dr. Gibb, and Mr. J.

To The Electors Of The City Of London.
TO THE ELEC1tOS OF THE MIY OF LONDON'.
Gentlemen,
QIXTEEN years ago I ww~ called upon by a con-
P'ddferable bodY amnong Yost to come forwrard aso a candidate to reseentyon. It was supposed that my election for the city of London would oontribute to the promnotion of free trade, and the cause of civlt andnelgiouslberty.
Accepting your invitation, I relinquisbed a seat which was high!? honouLrable and independent, and ahortly became one of your repre.- sentativer.
The meweure which I have brouLght forwarLIad supported durinl that time have generallymiet with youLr faTvour.
The reductIn of import duteies, the repal of the corn lawrs, the abo. ltlon of the differential dutieg on auzu the vep iof the rehiUo
contained in the navigation laws, have been approved by the great ma. jority among you. I have laboured earnestly, with your ooncurrence, though without success, for the removsl of thle disabilities affecting thaejewe. Equa&lfavour hasu totatnded the coursewhlrhlhsve - cetLy pursuod. Before Ispeak of it, you mustpermit me to o1,eff
that, whether popular or otherwise, my vroles have been the result of deep convictions formed onL no inconsldembtle experienco of public affairs I will not Tenture to say th at I may not have been frequently In error all I can pretend to is a laborious study of the questioneia agitation, and an hooestt desire to promote the honour and welfare of the country.
The time hau not arrivod for explaining fuIly the course I took after the conferences at Vienna. I believe it would have been Impogaiblis toliaTemadeapeacewhihwoufld have satisfied the expectatIons ot theocountry before the fall of Sobasto poLl.Icoldmnot,bhowevr,rdescline the misson which was proposed to mne In the name of my Sovereign and it Is my opinion that the terms I was prepared to recomnmend would sub6tantially, though in an incosirenlest manner, have secured Turkey agin&ist the aggressions of Rtsisa, sad would have been
honourable to Great Britalin. Whether Russias would have accepted
themIisdoubtful.
The question of hoettlltes In Chins has made it the duxty of Parliament to examine bowand for what purpose, those hostilities were commenced. On lookig crfully over the papers relating to this subJect I found that in the miserble affair of the Arrow reprisals bsad been resorted to, and reparation offered. The Chinese Commissioner had proposed an arrangement for the future, which was declared to be "'very proper'"Iniettercof Consul Parkes of the l2dof October. But on the x4th. when all wag on the eve of adlustmaent. Sir jobn Bowelng wrote as follows to Sir MfichaelSeymour,_." I1 cannot doubt that the Imperial Commissoner will now feel the absolute necessity of coDmplyIng with the demands which have been made, aid I have to add that if Your Excellency and the Consul should concur with mne In opinion that the circumstances are auspicious for requiring the fulfilment of treaty obligations as regards the city of Canton, and for arranging an official meeting with the Imperial Commiisciener within the city walls, I shall willingly come to Canton for that purposte," ko.
The consequence was a demand for an official mneeting with the ImperialCmmiseiouer withinL thecity walls, and that demand not having teen compliled with. fire was opened en the CoDmnlecioner'o resfidence at I1p.m. of the same day upon which the demand had been made.
MY objections to these proceeding sare,-let, That the new demand was grafted upon a quarrl which might otherwise have been amicaLbly settled; 2d, that It led to cenes of blodsebd and destrutlonwherein many innocent persons perishied; 3d, that such a demand ought to have been addresse to the tm-peror, and that due time should have been allowed for an answer; 4th that before hostilIties wero commnenced due prepartion-s sbhoud Lave been made in concert with lbs authorities at. home for the protection of the Ilves and properties of British subjeets: 5th, that the demand of acces to the Commissioner was xot authorized by the instructions of the Secretary of State.
WheRs the tidinigs of these events arrivtd in England the Ministry ha a question of some difficulty to determine. There isseine hazard and some discouragement attendanit upon the disavowal of publio sear'rants Performing their duties at a distance. On the other hand, the entire and coDmplete adoption of the proceedinps at Cantonl inVOlved the iscrditof snctong acts of Tiolence whirb juatice could not approv, an thedan er f xtnding partialhbostilities ntoa sanguiar war Itwoud sem hatthe error of either couwrse miht have bee

the majoit of the House of omn,Fa a the fabsehood of a day, whic few hours of reflection must dspel. For my owng?rt, I took the same view of these lamentablo affairs as Sir Franci sng, my old friend and conleague, and I willingly borrow from his vindication of bin vote the followingnpssge r-"I had no coiceo left, and deliberately, and as if I had ben in a jury-box, I gave my vote that the Dpepsi laid upon the table failed to esftablish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resented to at Canton on the late affair of the Arrow." I Fhall be told that, however true ttsee words may be. still the motiom war practically a censure on the Government, and it was may duty to vote against Jt. I have been a party man all my life, and am not wllintg to underrate party considerations. In mnany case I perfectly undersisnd that, weighing the erils or advantages of two alternatives it may be perfectly justifiable to prefer the retainin a good dMOveLnet In office rather thani the carrying any particular motion. however good. B3ut there must be arme limit to these Party feelings. I cannot race war and all Ita horrors assa light mnatter. Perthe shedding of the blood,even ofour enemies, Ibelieve we areresponsible to ahigher tribunal;webhave no rsghttog%otowarv without a Justifiable cause; aLnd I do not reckon at a justlfa le cause the desire to keep my friends in office.
Then agatn, it is said, that although the Canton hostilities milght niot be issatlflabls, Lord Palmesston ought to be supported in continuin them because he conducted thie war against Russia with great rigour, and brought it to an honourable termination. I cheerfully, applauded his vigour in carrsing on war, and his moderation In maling peace ; but to ssupport wanton and munncessarybostilities on account of the merit of the Minister in a, contest whih is past seems to mesa loode of testifying national gratitude utterly indfensible.
BItl not probable. however, that the concens of China wil occupy mnuchk of the attention of the new Parliament. But the conduct of foreign affairs is closely connecte with our noling at home.
B3y a cours at once firm and conciliatory, the steady maintenance of ouir own rights, and a6 just regard to the rights of Other nations, we shall best preserve peace
BY establishing peace on lasting foundations, we sallU obtain the means of enforcing coonomy in the public expenditure. With peace an ,cnm we shall obtain leisure to pursue the work of legal social, eccle5iciszA, and political reform.I am perrfectly aware that the terms Peace, Economyr,and Reform have fo the moment lost their charm to the ears Of thle piresent generation.r But I maustyet declare that, if agatn elected your Representative, you mustunot expect from me an abjuration of my old creed. In eofice and out of offlce I have pursued the objects which three three wrords are Intended to designate. The p resent Government, sprung from tho Liberal party, cannot found their pwr-.antlonnyotherbasi than that ot the godold principlees aenrthe g&o3o7d oldcauase. Whatever maybe your determination, it is my purpose to adhere to them for the remainder of

LONDON, P'1rDAY,. MARCH 13, 1857.
In the Houso of Lords last night
The Earl of ExiNBORoouoH moved for certain returns connected with the execution by the British authorities in China of the Supplemental Treaty of 1847. Those returns related to three articles of that treaty, which aimed at the prevention of smuggling and ilicit trade ; and, now that we were dispoied to be severe on the Chinese as to their execution of treaty obligations, it was desirable to know whether British officials had been scrupulous in their observance of those obligations. The noble lord then passed to the subject of the reinforcements about to be sent to China, and contended that they would arrive too late, or, at any rate, at such a time of the year as to render the troops liable to great mortality. He trusted, too, that the Government would take care that the troopships were uot overcrowded, and that proper arrangements would be made for their ventilation. ie had heard with great regret that it was intended to send out some nmportantpersonage as a Plenipotentiary, that therr. was to be an expedition directed against other part, of China besides Canton,andthat there was to be ^ oint interference in Chinese affaim with other nations. All those propositions, if carried out, v ould only L iQW0 pllr operaRiQoA gad embitto our qu
which, in his opinion, ought to be brought to as tpeedy a settlement as w s ossible. The ole I lord concluded by moving for te returns
Lord PAmruE said that the present Season ef the year was, no doubt, the worst for Sending troop to China with a view to military operations. =3 Government, however, on mature consideration, had resolved that the course about to be pursued wa
the only one suited to the emergency. The troopa about to be sent to China were aIready under orders for India, and to India they would procoed if on their arrival in China it was found they were not wanted. Every precaution would be taken to send them out in a state of efficiency. It had also been determined not to make use of any native Indian troops on the present occasion.
Earl GREY wished to know whether the Govern ment had received by the last mail despatches of an alarming nature.
The Earl of CLARENDox said that Admiral SiEY3IOUR, as had been already stated on a former occasion, had announced to the Government his intention of abandoning some of his positions before Canton ow;ing to the threatening aspect of affairs at Hongkong. With regard to the returns moved for by Lord E«LLE sosouG}I, there could be no objectioz to prodncing them.
The motion was then agreed to.
Some other business was afterwards despatched,' and their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, on the order for goininto Committee of Supply,
Mr. PALx moved a series of resolutions to the effect that Sir Jons M'NzmL and Colonel TuLiLoo
ably fulfilled the duty of inquiring into the management of the Commissariat Department; that the evidence in their report proved the intense ferings of the army, and that great mortality was occasioned by overwork, exposure, and want of food and clothing, in December, 1854, and January, 1855; that the examinations of the Board of General Officers materially supported the conclusions of the Commissioners as to tho want of
organization in the Quartermaster-General's, Commissariat, and Transport services; and that, frora the report of the Board, this inefficiency must be attributed to the imperfect arrangement or conduct of those departments. In support of these resolu. tions Mr. PALK wvent over the sad details of thel "horrible and heart-rending" suffermags, and the great, excessive, and unusual mortality of the Crimean army, contending that the conclusion of the Commissioners, that they were attributable to departmental inefficiency, had been, by implication, confirmed by the Board at Chelsea.
MIr. BLACK eulogized the services of Sir Jonw MNErLL and his co-commissioner, whom he thought had conferred incalculable benefit upon the country; and he strongly condemned the treatment they had experienced.
Lord PAL-XRRsT0N, after repeating the testimony he had already borne to the merits of the Commissioners, observed that the speech of Mr. PAIE would have been very much in point two years ago, but since peace had been made, and so long a time had elapsed, a recital of calamities past and gone was at this moment out of date. The events had passed into the domain of history. Without disparagement to Sir JoinN MNN.rt and Colonel TuLLocn, he thought the medical commission had rendered more important services than the former could have rendered. The motion was not one which the House, in his opinion, ought to accede to, and he hoped M1r. PALK would not press it to a division.
The motion was strongly opposed by Sir J. FiTz-
GERALD.
General PEEL said he had arrived at a strong opinion that the calamities which had visited our troops in the Crimea were not in the power of any individual in the Crimea to control, and he complained of the clamour and unjust outcry which had pursued individuals. RLedid notunderrate themizeries of our soldiersin 1854 and 1855; but individualswere not answerable for them, and he proceeded to enumerate the causes to which he thought they were attributable, the main causes being, in his opinion, the commencing a great war with httle means, and undertaking a military operation upon a large scale without any reserve, in compliance with the cry for carrying on the war with vigour. He vindicated the proceedings and the conclusions of the Board of which he was a member, and he urged that Mr. PALKZ, in his speech as well as in his resolutions, had cast undeserved imputations. The services of the Commissioners, in his opinion, had been somewhat overrated.
Mr. S. HERBERT said his first reaection upon reading the resolutions was regret at questions being reopened over which a veil of oblivion should be thrown. He admitted that the Government oE which he was a member had been to blame for attempting too much. With respect to the Commissioners, the question was, had they executed an invidious duty ably, and had the CROWN marked in an unmistakeable manner its sense of their services ? He was of opinion that those services were important, and that the Commissioners had not received justice ; and he proposed that all the resolutions 'should be withdrawn, except the first, vwhich should be incorporated with the latter part of an amendment of which notice had been given by Mr. J. EWART (but which he could not move in point of form), so that the resolution would stand thus:-" That Sir JOHN I'ETmL and Colonel TULLOOn ably fulilled the duty intrusted to them of inquiring into the arrangement and management of the Commissariat Department, and, considering the able services rendered by them and the high testimony in their favour by HERBL MArTsy'sGovernment, that an humble address be presented to HER MAJESTY, praying that some espedal mark of approbation be conferred upon them."
Sir J. PAXiNGTON considered that the services of the Commissioners had not been recognized to the extent to which they were entitled, and he supported the propositioi of Mr. S. HERBERT.
MIr. J. EwA.nT was ready to adopt the proposition, to which Mr. PALK acceded.
Lord PAinrsrToN deferred to what appeared to be the opinion of the House, and, the original motion being withdrawn, the amended motion was agreed to.
Sir J. FERBUSSON called attention to the present position of non-commissioned officers promoted to commissions in the army during the war.
The House then went into a Committee of Supply on the Army Estimates, when
Mr. F. PEEL said, the money votes for these estimates were on accouint for four months only, and, as the whole votes would come before the ensuing Parliament, it would be more convenient not to anticipate discussion and explanations upon the money votes. The case was different with the number of men, which must be voted at once,-namely 126,796 men, being a reduction of 119,920 upon the vote of last year, which was for 246,716 men. Mr. Prun entered into various details relating to the different portions of the forces.
The several votes were agreed to, after discussion.
Lord PAaRBsrON read the reply of HzR MAJESTY to the Address of the House, voted on Tuesday, signifying Han DI^JESr'S intention to confer some signal mark of her regal favour upon the SrSaaxx, and gave notice that he should this day move that the Hlouse do resolve itself into a committee to consider the subject.
In a Committee of Ways and Means, 21,009,7001 Exchequer-bills were voted towards making good the supply.
The Income-tax Bill was read a third time and passed, after a short discusion.
The third reading of the Extraparochial Places Bill likewise gave rise to a brief debate. It ultimately passed.
Other Bills passed the same stage, and some through committee.
The House adjourned at a few minutes to 11 o clock
Lord JOHN RUSSELL has changed his mind
Lord JoUw RusszLL has changed his mind again. The announcement is no longer a startling one, and only Fends one baclk to recollect the last point on which his Lordship made up his xni, and what it was abouit. So, Iet us see. Wh* did we last leMO him t We had almost lost the tiUaa of his ins and outs. The last consistenoy be b-ad aLettled to did not imniediately concern tlo de'tAiny of the British empire and its relatiorA with Ithe Rusian and several other emp,res ; it only related to the city of Loaldon. His Lordship has discovered that in pronojr cing for the ' digra -of Sir Joux. Bowiro, )F"= l1.&TE's -
advisers, and his country, he had, as they say, I been reckoning without his host. The city gentlemen did not like the look of his Lordship's paper, and refused to discount it. Some of them, or xather a good many, went to Lord PAT-MERSTON and invited him to perform the part of PERSEUS for 'the civic ANDROsrEDA. Another numerous body met and passed a resolution that, for the future, they would rather have commercial representatives. This vwas the civillest possible way of telling Lord JOHN
hUJsSML that they could do without hhi, and his
rcrdship took the hint. It was speedily announced that he would retire to Tavistock, which would put ,him so much on a par with his noble antagonist that the similarity of position itself would have told in his favour. Tavistock and Tiverton are in the samie county, both begin with T, are both trisyllabic, and contain somewhere about the same number of 101. houses and registered electors. Tiver-ton is on the Exe, which has beein honourably ementioned by the Premier for its unifornm practice of flowing downwards to the sea; and Tavistock is -on another stream which probably does the same. It was arranged, so it was said, that Mr. GEORGE Bvrw, the hope of his party, should stand for MIiddlesex, so long represented by his namesake; and, had the county been agreeable to the arrangesnent, one of the Whig families would still havehad a metropolitan constituency. Lord Jon?u RUSSELL, however, never in the whole of his long and varied career lost his original character as a man put forwad by his friends, and has always been 'well worlced in this capacity. They have latterly been not quite satisfied with his position, and were still less prepared to see him bowing before the tribunal of public opinion in the first constituency of the empire. So, 'with the temerity of devotees dragging their 'wooden idol with them into battle, -they have turned his Lordship's face once more towards the City, and at their inspiration he has ipublished " an Address to the Electors of Lon" don." It comes out just in time to read side by side with another address from hIr. RAIKES 'CuRnm:, one of his Lordship's oldest and strongest supporters, offering bimself for the vacant seat.
Lord Jonu RussmEL's Address is a histoly of his Parliamentary services, and if it were a memorial respectfully submitted " by the und^rsigned" to the head of a department for promotion or compensation, or a good service pension, or a superannuation, or anything that people memorialize for, the document would deserve the highest consideration. But Lord JonNi did not himself take either a historical, or a biographical, or any other retrospective view of the question the @ther day when, by the vote of his friends and his adherents, he placed a Government under censure, an old friend under condemnation, besides exposing Parliament to a certain dissolution. He then took the microscopic rather than the telescopic view of political affars. In fact, that is just what he proceeds to ,do in thisAddress, for, after refreshing his eyes once more with the survey of his own career in the warm colouring of a setting sun, he buries himself in what he calls " the miserable affair of the " Arrow," and strings together a column of quotations, names, dates, and everything, out of the Blue-book. A " paste and scissors" composition is never a good one, and on reading, or attempting to read, that before us, the City folks must feel very much as the French lady did on the receipt of a letter from her admirer of whioh she had read every word in his newspaper several days before. Lord JoHN had his say in the Debate, and the day is past for argument 'when there is no one to reply. His Lordship, however, is quite right in taking for granted that the question before the City of London is not now Free Trade, or Civil and Religious Liberty, or the Navigation Laws, but the honour of the British flag, and whether 'we ought to abandon or stand by HMR MAJESTY'S servants, who have maintained the honour of that flag to the best of their discretion. For that admission, though it rather supersedes the previous list of personal services, we thank his Lordship; and as for the rest, the quotations, the " etcetera," the days ard hours "p.m.," the " 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th," and all the rest, the electors of the City of London had much better read through the despatches themselves than place implicit confidence in any candidate's extracts or inferences. The five points which his Lordship undertakes to settle for the citizens of London are, in fact, five controversies, and they are not to be ruled by the ipse diri of any Ru-ssrnL under the sun. Ours may be worth no more, but it cannot possibly be worth less. So we will just back ours against his lordship's with five counter-propositions. 1st, Commissioner YEE, from first to last, refused to make a proper, unqualified reparation. 2d, the bloodshed and destruction arose directly out of his refusal, though he might have averted them by a conference in the city of Canton. 3d, as the " new demand" was only the condition on which we would defer taking just and necessary reprisals, and was siwply the discharge of a treaty obligation, there was nothing to refer to the EnrEnSon. 4th, we don't keep a naval force amounting to more than three hundred guns on the Chibese waters with the idea that a gun is never to be fired without orders from home. 5th, EBB MJEsry's servants are bound to vindicate her rights on all occasions and opportunities, if they think it advisable to do so.
But, after aU this minute detail and these broad conclusions, Lord JoHNx RUSSELL rests his case with the city of London on a proposition which, in politics, we will be bound to say is as monstrous a -one as was ever hatched in the worst extremity of -faction. His Lordship, as if he had some misgivings as to its nature, borrows it from his old friend and colleague -Sir F. BAItNG. It is a popular maxim of British jurisprudence that it is better ten guilty men should escape than that one inno-cent man should be punished; and, according to Sir F. BARING and his noble endorser, it is better ten innocent British Governors should be punishcd than that one offending Governor should escape. Sir F. BAnING, in the long extract which Lord JoHN has cut out and pasted into his Address, supposes him-self in a jury-box, and then, because some papers before him do not make out entirely to his satis-faction that Sir Jonx BOWBLNG could not by
better management have avoided bloodshed, he finds him guilty of murder, and i Mrs RAJlzsT's advisers accessories after the fact. Such a -sentiment is astounding, and, though one never knows quite 'what to expect from a BARIG, it is enough to provoke the patience of a saint, let alone an Englishman. Is the House of ConMons a jury-boxe Was Sir JOHN BOWane-G
present at the bar? Did he even know that he was on his trial? Is Sir F. BARuNiG a juryman, or, as he avows himself, " a party m an all his 4" life ?" Is it the rule of Englishmen to find everybody guilty who, in his absence, and on tho evidence of letters, cannot be proved undoubtedly inmocent ? We can only say that, though 'we have mometimes thought HB MAjEsTy's service rather a hard one, we never thought it quite so bad as
that. If that is to be the rule for colonial Governors and naval com nders twelve thousand miles off,
dealing with b =arians who cut ofi heads at the rate
of 400 a-day and poison an island at a time, then we should certainly advise any friend of ours to fly betimes from so dangerous a position and seek bread and cheese in the employ of Eome respectable City firm .
The only conclusion that any reasonable man% can come to. on this Address is that the writer is, and has been for several gears, quite at sea, under
some serious disability for making up his own mind on rational prineiples. Every obser.. of human nature knows that the most wilful people are the most capricious, and the least to be accounted for. There is a diversity of argument in the Address, a taking frst one ground, then another, finishing with none at all, that makes one almost doubt the identity of the writer through consecutive sentences. Having placed himself, by his own act, at the bar of public opinion on the Chinese question, he recommends himself as having done not quite so ill as people thought he did in the negotiations for peace vith Russia. Having dragged the Premier to the same bar. he admits Lord PALMRSTON'S Superior vigour and equal moderation in that struggle, but refuses to allow in his case the fair inference with regard to the present affair. After all this inconsistency, not to say levity, we are not surprised to find his Lordship winding up with the exceedingly light observation, " It is not probable,
"however, that the concerns o/ China will occupy "amuch of the attention of the new Parliament." What decent interpretation is it possible to put on this ? What, as Parliament is to meet next May, and half will be pledged to the opinion that England is committed to the abominable " iniquity," as the Bis'op of OxFoRD called it, and wholesale murder, and the other half equally pledged to defend the country, the instant it has decided who is to be Premier it is to drop the Chinese question al.,ogetber, and apply itself to "peace andeconomy," to "legal, social, ecclesiastical and political reform !" Cau his Lordship possibly mean that the Chinese difficulty will be over in May-i. e., that Sir JoinL BOWRING and Sir M. SEYmOUR. will have settled it before they hear a word of the proceedings in Parliament ? He cannot mean that which would stultify the whole of his own conduct in this affair. He can only mean-what, indeed, everybody knows-that, be it just' or unjust, fair reprisal or gratuitous mn'ssacre, any Government whatever brought in by the new Parliamert will prosecute the war with the utmost vigour, and that England will endure no other course. "Its murder," his Lordship says in effect, "but never mind, we " shall not trouble ourselves much about it " when the new Eouse meets, but occupy " ourselves with domestic reforms." We can only say that if Lord JoHN RUSSELL really feels that " for the shedding of blood, even of our enemies, " we are responsiblo to a fighe; tribunal," he ouglht, no matter on what side ef the House, to protest to his last breath against a causeless war, and hold all " social and ecclesiastical "reforms" as. frivolities and toys compared with national crime. His language leaves the impression that he is prepared " to stand the " responsibility" if we wiU only lay it on his shoulders. For our part, we would rat*er be spared an example of inconsistency that vworld be scandalous to the national chai-acter; and we cannot help thinking the City of London will feel with us on this point.
Although the terms of the Treaty with Persia
Although the terms of the Treaty with Persia are not tv be published until the ratification by the Government of Teheran is received, there seems no doubt that the main points have been correctly given in some French journals and in our own correspondence. Persia restores Herat, and promises to respect the independence of the Affghan Principalidies. England is placed on the footing of the most favoured nation and establishes Consulates wherever any other Power possesses them. We give up the demand for the dismissal of the Prime Minister of rersia, but, -on the other hane, Mr. MuRRAY will return to Teheran and be received with full honours. Commercial staJions will be established at the mouth of the Euphrates, and at two points in the Persian Gulf.
We need not say that we receive with satisfaction these terms of peace. They are honourable to ourselves without being gratuitously humiliating to the Persian Govermment. The indepcndence of Affghanistan is secured, the touchy honour of the British Minister at Teheran is to be soothed, and we may hope now fo; the psrmanent tranquillity of our North-Western frontier and a grear development of our cowrmerce and influence in Central Asia. But why could not aU this have been done some months ago? If we are rightly informed, Lord CowIEY has accepted in Paris terms almost identical with those which Lord STRATFORD refused at Constantinople. The most important point, the restoration of Herat, was proposed by FERU1K IHAN' himself on his arrival in the Turkish cap' al. At tb.pt time it will be remembered the capture of Herat was not known. FERuK Kn1Aw sent to the British Ambassador announcing his powers and his desire to open negotiations. Lord STItATFORD, after communicating with the Government, accepted the offer, but stated that it was strange a Persian Envoy should seek to make a trerty while a Persian army continued to besiege Herat. Then, we believe, FERuK KaA, in the most precise manner declared that the Persians would at once retire from Herat and ackno.vledge its independence if the British oper4tions in the Gulf were discontinued. Negotiations commenced, and while they were proceeding news of the fall of Herat arrived. The Persian Plenipotentiary did not wait to be questioned on the subject, but wrote at once to say that this event would have no influence, and that tlhe place would be at once restored. But the matter was complicated by the ultra-Oriental requiremen:s of the British negotiator or the Government which instructed him. Whether Iir. MUtRuxY should be received with a certain ceremonial,whether the SHAH should be forced to make a humiliating apology, vhether the SADR AzAzr should be dismissed or resign, or preserve his office, were the questions anxiously discussed. As the result showed, the demards of the British Government were considered too offensive to Persian dignity, and the negotiations were broken off. How far the blame is due to the negotiators or to the mischievous interference of foreign advisers we cannot pretend to determine.
The Persian Ambassador then came to Paris, where he again sought to open negotiations. We cannot but think that the rational view now taken of the whole matter by the English people tended to make the settlement of these differences more easy. Lord CowLnY ceased to press for the degradation of the SADR AzAm, and we believe tle reception of Mr. MUuY, though sufficiently honourable, is not to be accompanied with certain forms which would have been offensive to the Persian authorities. In other respects we have gained all we can desire. The establishment of Consulates will enable us to watch the intrigues of Russia, the right of being treated as the most favoured nation will allow our trade to expand rapidly in those regions, and the interests of the newlyplanned communications are cared for by the clause concerning the establishment of stations at the mouth of the Eaphrates, at Karrak, and at Ormuz. But it is certainly not to be denied tbat we could have obtained these very termns at lonstantinople, since we have, in fact, given up all on vhich the Plenipotentiaries then d.sagreed; and we cannot but think that our posUAion would have been higher if peace had been sig-ea before FBRux IiHAN came to Paris or the English forces had captured Bushire. The morrl victory would certainly have been greaten. To Orientals, accustomed to judge by what strikes the imagination, it would oedainly have given a higher notion of tho powv of England if Persia had
desisted from the attack on Herat or restored it in the hour of victory, in obedience to what would have seemed the command of the English Government. Now Persia merely restores the city in exchange for Bushire. MIoreover, in the former case England treated alone; now the world will be slow to believe that we are not indebted to the mediation of the French EmPEuRo for the modified success we have obtained. To come to Paris to regulate a matter connected with our Indian Empire is hardly a proceeding calculated to preserve lofty conceptions of British power among the ignorant or the hostile.
However, the affair is concluded, we have gained our objects, and with good policy may look for a solid, durable peace. But will our policy be good? Certainly not if it is only a renewal of the traditions of former Embassies. Every one acquainted with those regions is of one opinion. The State which the SuA governs is weak, and is drawn towards a protector by a natural instinct. Now, the only two Powers which can aspire to protect it are Russia and England. Persia lies between them, and would gladly be at peace with both, but long experience has taught her that from neither can she expec'u much sympathy. Russia is the more hated and the more feared, because the danger from the armies of Georgia and the fleets of the Caspian is palpable and immediate. The protection and alliance of England would, therefore, naturaly be sought by this feeble State in its extremity; but the successive English Missions have done nothing but repel
the advances and insult the prejudices of the Per-' sians. Of such a policy, so blind, so suicidal, we now see the natural results. The Russians have taken up the position of protectors, and Persia has been forced into their arms. England, on the other hand, whose part was obviously to conciliate and strengthen this unhappy Asiatic State, bas been looked upon, not unreasonably, as a restless and implacable eneniy. A country which we do not wish to conquer, and which it is not our interest to see conquered, should evidently be our ally and receive our support. Instead of this, all the Envoys of late years, forgetting the example of one or two able predecessors, have done nothing buit dispute and threaten, and assert their dignity by insisting on little matters of punctilio. It will be plain to every one that in the present state of the world such a miserable policy must cease. The late war with Russia has, no doubt, been followed by most important and happy results. The career of Earopean aggression is checked for at least the lifetime of the present generation. From Norway to the Bosphorus the Russians must give up their designs of adding fertile tracts and important seaports to their territory. They fid, to their cost, thatthe Powersof Europe, great andsmall, England, France, Austria-nay, even Prussia, together withl Turkey and the Scandinavian States, will resist, when matters become serious, any extension of the Russian frontier to the West. But it is well understood that the Court of St.
ketersburg has not awakened from its dreams of empire. It is more than confessed-it is openly boasted, that the stream which has been dammed up in Europe will turn its course and flow towards the South and East. Here it is thought that the Russian will have only one rival to meet. England alone is interested in the affairs of Asia, while the other great Powers of the world wiU be glad to look on and see the two pre-eminently conquering races confronting and neutralizing each other. In Asia, then, from Persia to China we may expect a long struggle of policy, if not of force, with the statesmen of the Cz-tn. It is our duty to make use of policy as well as force, and foremost among the plans of a wise Government will be the extension of our influence in Persia by a prudent diplomacy. If our future Ministers at Teheran do their duty we have no fear of the result. What can Russia or any other Power offer which can be compared with the advantages that we can confer ? In a few years we may increase tenfold the revenues of the Persian Government, by developing traffic and introducing into the country the means of communication which are now being established in Turkey and India. The Orientals, whatever they may be, are not waniting in acuteness, and we believe FEnu KR"N and his co untrymen know how to choose between the alliance of a grasping military empire, which only aims at bringing provinces under its desolating reign, and the friendship of a civilized and enterprising nation, which improves every land it touches, and has, as it were, the faculty of turning everything into gold. Let us do our part honestly and skilfully. So, when the Persian Government has fulfilled the conditions of peace and made the desire-d apology to Mr. MunrAy, the British Governaent will do well to look out for a man or men capable of rising to a comprehension of the new policy which it is our interest to inaugurate.
The history as well as the affairs of the Royal
The history as well as the affairs of the Royal British Bank is now undergoing authentication before an official tribunal, and the first results of this inquiry appeared at great length in our columns of yesterday under the form of an examination, still incomplete, of Mr. EDWARD ESDAILE, the Governor of the institution in question. As far as it is possible to affect any doubt respecting transactions. which have already acquired unmistakeable notoriety, we may suggest to our readers that the actual case before the public is still pending, and, in fact, the representatije of the assignees offered to defer the consideration of certain points on the acknowledged ground that more time might fairly be required for the investigation. Enough, however, has transpired, and especially in one most notable respect, to invite attention, and the reader, indeed, may well be desirous of getting at some short cut through so tedious a narrative. Let it be observed, then, that three principal features of the concern are brought into prominent relief,-its formation, its management, and the policy of its directors at an advanced period of its career.
The Royal British Bank commenced business on the 19th of November, 1849, with a capital of 100,0001., in shares of 1001. each. According to the Act for the regulation of such concerns, 50,0001, of this capital ought to have been actually paid up, but the witness admitted that this provision had not, in reality, been complied with. The subscriptions received were not all in casb, some being in " the representatives of cash," a phrase afterwards explained by the statement that the balance, or amount not paid up in money, was " represented by notes of hand, which were "deemed to be equivalent to cash." In point of fact, the representation of the c^rtificate addressed to the Board of Trade on the occasion was, : so "far as that the 50,0001. was not in sovereigns or " bank-notes, incorrect," though it does not appear, if we apprehend the case correctly,that the difference here was very great, as the cash portion amounted to nearly 43,0001. out of the whole. Another incident, however, of this part of the history is delineated immediately afterwards. Mr. LIMLATxR, who appeared for the assignees, implied very plainly that the directors were supposed to have borrowed money before tfie opening of the Bank for the purpose of placing it to the credit of the account, and to have drawn it out again directly this purpose had been answered. The witness accordingly was asked, first for his knowedge, and then for his belief ou this point, and,
wIas hrewafly pressed both by Mr. Lm'xLATER and the Commissioner. His reply was, that he " had no belief upon the subject. His mind was "a blank upon the suibject entirely; he had no "belief," and with this answer the Court was fain to be content.
Passing to the management of the Bank, we are introduced not only by description, but bodily, to the notorious "pocketledgee' of Mr. CA=Eo2, the General MIanager, which appears in the shape of a large greeu volume. It was kept in Mr. CAmRTox's private room, and " might have been accessible" to the Directors, but " it was not their practice " to refer to it." Mr. ESDAmx had been a Director of the Bank from its commencement; on the 1st of February, 1855, he became its Governor, and then, but not before that time, he became cognizant of the contents of this book. He there found that accounts had been opened in the books of the Bank with seven of the Directors, including Mr. CAvno.N himself. According to a rule of the Bank, no such accounts should have been opened, except under the precise sanction of the Finance Committee, but the witness " did not " know that that rule was strictly observed " upon the opening of drawing and discount "accounts of the Directors themselves; they " would not, probably, have gone through that " same routine." With respect to a particular transaction in which the witness himself was concerned, he said that " If the thing had been "rigorously treated, perhaps application to "theFinance Committee ought to have been made, "but that rule never applied to a Director's "account." We are not long in discovering the rVsults of this indulgent relaxation. MIr. CAmmERo
stands indebted to the Bank for upwards of 19,0001., and other accounts of a similar nature will occur to the reader's memory, but which we do not mention here, as they have not appeared in the examination before us. Already, however, MAr. ESDAnE had admitted that one of the Solicitors to the Bank, who died in 1853, had borrowed several thousand pounds of the Bank, which could not be recovered ; that he had deposited as security deeds which had afterwards to be surrendered without consideration, as the property of others; aud yet that up to the close of 1853, so perfectly were the Directors impressed with the integrity of his character, that on the 13th of December they were desirous of recording, by formal resolution, " their regard for his memory, and their lively " recollection of his social and many amiable " qualities." It further appeared, too, that whereas by law the Bank was debarred from making advances on the security of its own shares, advances were made for which shares were deposited, the explanation of such proceedings being this,-that the money was advanced, in fact, on notes of hand, but, as the Bank had an opportunity of strengthening its position by a hold upon the shares, this collateral guarantee was taken advantage of.
It is with respect, however, to the statements publicly put forward regarding the general affairs of the Bank that Mr. ESDA E'S evidence pos3ses the greatest importance. On the matter of advances he seems to represent the case for the Directors mainly by what he said concerning the transactions of Mr. CAIMEON-viz., that they were not cognizant, but had the meaus of being so. "That," said he, "is where the laches has "been, no doubt. I admit that." But in the case of the Banks position he speaks out at some length -rather at too great length, indeed, to please Mr. Lrsx..TE&R, who was for getting categorical answers to questions of a very killing ldrd. The poin:s urged are, that at the very moment the Bank was represented as prosperous, and the public wera invited to take new shares, it was well known that the concern was hopelessly insolvent; that profits were declared and dividends made when there were no profits and ought to have been no dividend; and that the accounts laid before t.e shareholders were absolutely false. In this part of the case considerable prominence is assumed by certain Welsh mining works in which the Bank had invested money, and which are made to figure in the assets for mucll more than their value. The history of this propertywe pick out as follows :-It came to the Bank in the way of security in 1850; an attempt was made to get rid of it in 1853, whieh failed; an arrangement was made with a certain person to "work" it, which came to nothing, and in 1854 it was resolved to put it up to auction with a reserved bidding of 70,0001., but no purchaser could be found. Yet, uotwithstanding all this, these precious works were represented in the accounts sent to the shareholders in June, 1856, as worth 120,0001., which estimate, together with others, would communicate a false impression of the position of the Bank. Concerning the Welsh works Mr. ESDAILE observed, that between theperiod of 1854, when they would have been disposed of for 70,0001., and 1856,when they were valued at so much more, an additional outlay had been made upon them, ard to the benefit of this consideration there is clearly some title. It is useless, however, encumbering the case with the details even of such items as these, for the inexorable interrogatory of Mr. L=ILTER extorted admissions that in December, 1854, June, 1855, and December, 1855, a large amount was represented as an asset which in truth consisted of bad and doubtful debts; that at none of these periods, nor in 1856, ought one shilling of profit to have been divided; that from June, 1855, down to the closing of the Bank profits were declared, although the whole first paid up capital was believed to be gone; and, finally, that at the time the advertisement was issued for new shares the Bank was believed to be in a state of insolvency. With such general acknowledgments there can be no occasion for our entering into particular itemis; and we proceed, therefore, by way of conclusion, to the restrictions and qualifications with which Mr. EsDE guarded the admissions above described.
Instead of recapitulating the various exprensions which he gave to his views on this subject, we shall do him better service, perhaps, by condensing them into one general plea. His argumeit is, that at the time when he and the other controlling autborities of the Bank became cognizant of its doubtful assets, its Jeopardized capital, and its
precarious position, they were placed in such a situation as compelled them to a choice of desperate expedients. To have stated the plain truth would have been to destroy at once the credit of the Bank and the chances of reovery, and to precipitate the ruin of the shareholder, whose interests they were bound to defend. On the other hand, several considerations were regarded as promising a more hopeful dourse for the future, and if with new management, a new position, and improving business, they could right themselves again, nobody would be damaged and everybody would be saved. It was no uncommon thing for mercantile establishments to have difficulties to face in the early part of their careers, and back debts and obligations to make up in more prosperous days. Why, then, should the Directors of this particular institution deny themselves the chances of fortune any more than others-why should they proclaim their own embarrassments to the world instead of taking all the mesures in their power to weather the storm and work through the rough times of the Bank's existence t This is a fair summary of MIr. ESDA.UeS exculpation, He &dmit4 that certain things were uQt justiaed by
fact, bui thinks that they were ao by circumstances and intentions, and considers that such an arnount of prosperity as it was fair enough to hope for -would in the end have covered all. We certainly, even if we desired to anticipate the results of the pending inquiry, need be at little trouble to expose the utter unsoundness of such assumptions as these, We forbear, however, at present from adding to our remarks, and hope only that we may have placed the case in an intelligible forn for the judgment of the public.
Tardy justice has at length been done by the
Tardy justice has at length been done by the House of Commons to the two Crimean Commissioners, Sir JomNz M`NziL and Colonel TULLOCH. After considerable discussion, and some ungraceful opposition on the part of the First Minister, a motion, originally brought forward by Mr. PALK, and subsequently amended by NIr. S. HERBERT, was agreed to by the House last night. This was to the effect, that the two Commissioners had very ably discharged the duties with which they had been intrusted, and therefore that an address should be presented to the QUxin;, praying that some signal mark of favour should be conferred upon them. Here, then, is the end of a very long and of a very troublesome business. Our General Officers and others whose conduct in the Crimea had been so justly and severely incriminated have been whitewashed by the verdict of a Board of General Officers; the two Commnissioners, on the other hand, whose :Report constituted the biUl of indictment against them, have been selected by the Commons of England as fit recipients for the Royal favour. We leave it to the public to determine which decision of the two is the more worthy of regard. The subject, as we are aware, is a somewhat stale one, and this was the ground upon which the Premier last night endeavoured to avoid a conclusion which, turn it as they will, conveys a heavy censure upon the persons whose conduct had virtuaUy been called in question by Sir JoHn MP'EiLL and Colonel TULLOCH. " The "events had passed," said Lord PALMERSTON, "into the domain of history." So, unfortunately, has the decision of the Chelsea Commissioners, and therefore, if on no other ground, it was important that the judgment of posterity should be better informed as to the real merits of the case. We, who have lived through all these events, are too painfully aware of the connexion between the disasters in the Crimea and the incapacity of too many of the officers in high command throughout the expedition. We, too, canperfectlyappreciatethe exact value of the gross farce which was played out at Chelsea. Fifty years hence, however, the case may be different. Posterity might conceive that the verdict of acquittal passed by the collective wisdom of the senile Generals upon Lords LJuc and CARDIGAN, upon General AiRmy and Colonel GonnDo, possessed real and intrinsic value. The future historian, however, in consequence of the resolution of last night, will have to deal with the point that the two gentlemen who had been specially despatched by the Government from this country to inquire into the precise facts were shortly afterwards recommended by the House of Commons to the CROWN for especial grace and favour. Now, these gentlemen had made a Report of such a kind that in order to clear their characters the Crimean Officer; felt it was incumbent upon them to have some kind of investigation. When al these facts are taken in connexion with each other we can have very little doubt that posterity will come to the same conclusion as has already been arrived at by every man of o-dinary sense in our own time who is unconnected with the aristocratic and high military cliques-namely, that the Crimean General Offlcers were very undeserving of the rewards and honours which were prematurely bestowed upon them before the country was aware of the exact amount of their participation in the Crimean disasters. Out of such monstrous abuse. however, we may in the end contrive to pluck that reform in military matters of which we stand in such grievous need. When the decoration which should be bestowed as the meed of distinguished courage and high capacity is seen upon the breasts of men who have not earned it, if it is a distinction at all, it is one in the same sense as the Scarlet Letter in fAwTHos;E's tale.
We have, then, as we may reasonably hope, at length fairly done with this dismal Crimean history. If anything were needed to add to the tdumph of Sir JoN M'NEiLL and Colonel TuLLocH it would be the period at which this Address has been wrung from a reluctant Ministry. The Head of the Government is about to appeal to the cou-itry, and so completely was he aware of the real nature of the feeling out of doors upon the subject that he did not care to face the constituencies without rendering justice to these two gentlemen. The question of military reform may be allowed to go to rest unless th;s country shall be again engaged in hostile operations of serious importance, but the opinion as to the gross incapacit~y of too many of the officers lately in high command in the Crimea will survive. Tho public may be too indolent to move in the matter, their at ention may be distracted by other topics of more fmmnediate interes>, but whenever the fatal word " Crimea" is mentioned the reco]ection of al that was there suffered, and of aU that need not have been suffered, by our brave soldiers will immediately arise before the minds of all. General PI'm Iast night, as the representative of the Chelsea Board, rose to defend the good old rotten cause, and in so doing injured only himself, without benefit to his clients. Sir Jom M`NEL and Colonel TuLLocH may be happy in the consciousness that they have been recommended by the House of Commons to the favour of the CROwN,-still more so in the conviction that this reco-mendation will receive the hearty approval of their fellow-subjects hroughout the Empire.

THE SUPPLY OF GUANO.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have the satisfaction to be able to announce to you that, particularly through the exertions of Mr. Evelyn D)enison, M.P., the Government have engaged to station a ship of war at the guano islands in Kooria MIooria Bay in August, and that the trade will then be thrown open to all British ships, and be protected by the Governmnent from molestation. I
Messrs. Hindson and Hayes, of Liverpool, the Gocimnment lessees of the islands, have forwarded to me a copy of the Secretary of State's letter, which I send herewith. As there is now a near prospect of an increased supply of guano and an entirely open trade (a tonnage to the extent of 150,000 tons h.aving already offered for it), I trust that the Peravia,n Xnonopaly has been foined at last.
The agericul,tural interest is rmuch indebted to Lord Palmeraton's Government for their prompt deGision, in the queston.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have read with some feelings of surprise, under the head of "1 Naval and Military InteLigence " in TVe Timer, a paragraph to the effect that among the regiments and transports selected for the Chinese expedition are the 23d Welsh Fusileers and the celebrated naval lueus a 7iin, &c., Her Majesty's ship Transit.
I have no doubt that the gallant and devoted regiment above mentioned will maintain-it can. scarcely augment-its hardly-won reputation. I fear very much that the famous slow-sailing, slowsteaming transport Transit wiU support its character, and, if possible, excel its former performances, unless she be a very different craft in engines and hull from the vessel in which one branch of the Legislature spent such a happy afternoon not many months since when the Queen reviewed the fleet ati Spithead.
Why are the 23d sent out so soon after a campaig. in the Crimea in which they were twice annihilated. -nothiug of them left almost but the name, the number, the glorious colours, and a few officers and men ' I find that they embarked for the East; 31 offlecrs, 911 non-commissioned officers and men; that they received as reinforcements 41 officers, 1,074 men during the war; that 22 officers and 704 men died in the Rast; that 21 officers and 345 men. were invalided home. The great majority of the present strength consists of young men and boya of little or no service. They are about to proceed to a trying climate, and they will have to take share in & campaign which wil open in the dogdays, in which sun-stroke, Judging from the experience of the last war, will kill more men than the enemy. This is a severe test for a regiment so constituted. Is it wise or necessary to expose them to it'?
As to the Transit, let us hope that something ham been done to her to justify the Government in trusting on board a body of English soldiers; abov& all when it is desirable that they should be conveyed to their destination not only with safety but with despatch.
I dare say there are good answers to these suggestions, but one would like to hear and know 'what they are. Until then, Sir, I, for one, hoDe that the gallant 23d will be permitted to enjoy a " little respite after all their toils," and I trust that neither they nor any of mv friends nor your obedient sar-

(FROM OUR OWN CORREVOWDNDw.)
[A portion of tho following appeared in our aeoond EdIitton of TeAte?dav:-1
PARIS, MAoRC li, 6 P.M.
Prince Daniel of Montenegro intends, I believe, to go to London as soon as he has obtained an audience of the Emperor. The Prince has been advised that the present is the most favourable moment to establish his position in a defirnite manner as regards the Porte. I cannot say what encouragement he has as yet received that the h ereditary power rhall be established in his family, and that the independence of the " Black Mountain," which has long existed in fact, 8o far as Turkey is concerned, s.hould be formaly recognized by the Powers..
Under the old constitution of Montenegro, when the Sovereign died the installation of his successor wvas attended by great commotion, and produced much embarrassment. The heir used to be named in the wil of. the deceased, who united in his own person the temporaland,spiritualauthority. BeingnecessarilyaBishop as well as a Prince, and condemued to celibacy, he left no direct descendant, and it was generally a nephew who was named as his successor by the Vladika. The choice among the nearest relations of the testator was almost invariably the occasion of disputes. He was sometimes a simple monk-sometimes a layman. In either case it was indispensable that, before his installation as Prince, he should be consecrated a Bishop, and consecration could only be conferred by a Greek Metropolitan. For that purpose it was necessary for him to repair to Carlovitz, in Austrian Servia, or to St. Petersburg, as the GreekMetropolitans who derive authority from the Patriarchate of Constantinople were regarded by the Montenegrins as mere dependents on the Porte, and consecration from them was vitiated by its connexion with Ialamis=. The Prince-Bishops of the country, who had been formerly consecrated by the schis,matic Metropolitan of Austria, gradually broke offy from him, and ended by preferring the Prelate of the Russian Church. Prince Daniel, whose name appeared in the testament oE the last Vladika, Peter Petrovitch, his uncle, proceeded in February, 1852, to St. Petersburg, accompanied by two Montenegrin senators, under the pretext of obtaining the consecration which was indispensable to his assuming the spiritual authority. As soon, however, as he arrived at Vienna he addressed a letter to his Senate informing them that he had decided on renouncing his spiritual power; he directed them to consult the people, and he added that if their decision was not in his favour he should obtain an authorization from the Czar, which must be considered as a peremptory order by the Montenegrins to agree to the change. There is no doubt that his plans had been formea previous to quitting Montenegro, with the approbation, and probably at the instigation, of Russia, for the nearest kinsmen and friends of the Prince had been previously gained over to his cause. In accordance, however, with the communication of the Prince, the Senate convoked at Cettinye a general assembly of the people, who all but unanimously decided in favour of a change in the constitution, based on the separation of the spiritual from the temporal power. The Senate issued a decree in conformity with that decision, which, besides establishing the separation, enacted that the hereditary authority should be fixed in the family of Prince Daniel Petrovitch Niegosch and his heirs male in the order of primogeniture. In default of direct heirs male the sovereignty should pass to the nearest male relative, and to the eldest in the event of there being several within the same degree. It was, moreover, settled that the Bishop, or Archbishop, in case the bishopric should be raised to that rank, should also be chosen from the family of the Prince, or from some other of the most illustrious of the country. Commissions were appointed to carry that resolution to Prince Daniel, then at Vienna, and also to the Czar. The Prince continued his journey to St. Petersburg, accompanied by the Commissioners, and announced to the Emperor the pacific revolution that had taken place, and the reform in the constitutiona that had been voted by the popular assembly at Cettinye. On his return to Montenegro in the mnonth of July following the Prince was received with great enthusiasm by his people. On the Sunday following the President of the Senate read to the people assembled in front of the palace of the Prince a communication addressed by the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, to the effect that the Czar, taking into consideration the wishes tnanimously expressed by the Montenegrins, authorized Prince Daniel Petrovitch to renounce his sDiritual authority, to assume henceforth the title and quality of temporal Prince only, and to appoint, of his own free choice, the Bishop that should take his place in the powers which he had given up. Russia therefore, formally approved the revolution effected in Montenegro, and actuaUy took it under her protection. The Montenegrins showved much anxiety to obtain an outlet to the sea by means of an extension of territory on the Adriatic, and a port nn that sea, which would, of course, be to the advantage of Russia. We know that they succeeded in possessing themselves of the Turkish fortress of Zabljak, which comnands the entranee to the Lake of Scutari. The Porte, contrary to the advice of France and England, commenced warlike operations against Montenegro; it established a maritime blockade on the coast of the Adriatic, and Turkish troops, under the command of Omar Pasha, invaded the country. The greater events that followed need not be alluded to.
The Montenegrins consider themselves, and have in fact, been independent of Turkey for a hundrea years back. Though the Porte persists in regarding that country as a portion of its territory, there is no doubt of its being in a condition different from that of 'vassal provinces. Since the period of the pacific revolution just noticed Prince Daniel has introduced a ,-gime more suitable to the people and the necessities of the time. The new constitution is a legal as weU as a political code, and it greatly differs from that which had governed the country since 1796. Montenegro has ceased to be a Republic under the authority of a Vladika, or Bishop-it has become a Principality under that of a secular Prince. According to the constitution the Sovereign promulgates the laws, not, like the previous Vladikas, m the name of the principal chiefs of the country, but only in accord with them. The appointment of the judges is no longer left to the people, it is the prerogative of the Prince. As a code of laws, the constitution prohibits all forays and acts of plunder on the Turkish territory when hostilities have not been openly declared. Among minor regulations, young men and women cannot now, as before, be compelled into forced marriages, and severe penalties are pronounced against usury.
The condition of. Montenegro was one of the topics of discusion at the Paris Congress last year. The Austrian Plenipotentiary expressed a desire for some explanations on the subject. He said that there was reason to suppose, from several circumstances OCCurring at various periods, that Rwsia meafnt to followv in Montenegro a hne of conduct similar to that which she had followed in the Danubian provinces, and that now was the tirae for the Plenipotentiaries to dissipate all doubts on that point. Count Orloff and Baron Brunow replied that there was no mention of Montenegro at either of the Conferences of Vienna the year previous, nor in the negotiations which preceded the present Congress, and that therefore they were not bound to- notice the question at all. Nevertheless, they had no objection to declare, as a questlon
bad been put to them, that the Russian Government had no other relations with MIontenegro than those whioh sprang out of the aympathies of the population towards Russia, and the kindly feelng of Rusia towards them, and, in a word, that
Montenegro had only to rely on herself. How far that declaration was true those who are acquainted with the workings of Russian policy are best able to estimate, and it i certain that the Prince of Montenegro rceives a pension from St. Petersburg. Be this a it may, Prinee Daniel considered that it was his interest to place himself in a definite position as regards the Sultan, who still claims to be the suzerain. He has already taken steps sat Constantinople with that view and the object of his present visit to Paris and his probable visit to London is, no dqqbt, to obtain the formal recognition of t #4: imependence of Montenegro, and that of the gS regime, which establishes hereditr power
LiJafamily. In the meantime thePrince, attended bj' respectable suite, thoughhe has come incognito, wnder the name of the Voivode of Liesanska, ons of-the aivisions of his mountain principality, has
tAken usp his quarters at the Hotel d Louvre. He had an interview on Monday with the French Miniter for Foreign Aairs, which laoted more than two hours. Among other arguments ia fatour of
his views, he denies thlat for centuriespest the Turks have ever received a piastre of tribute from Montenegro, or that any other act has taken place which would justify a claim to suzerainet6. The Russian pension, according to him, is merely the interest on the purchase-money paid by Austria for land belonging to hun, and which he lent to the Russian Government. The interest paid on it, however, appears to be about four or five times more than 'what is received by the ordinary State creditor.
The Moniteur de Ia Flotte has the following on Montenegro :_
" The presence in Paris of the reigning Prince of Montenegro attracts public attention to that remote region. A few facts on its present situation and its military organization may, therefore, be not devoid of interest. Montenegro (which the Turks call Kara-Dagh, or the Black Mountain) forms nominaly the sixth distdriet or Beyalet of the province of Roumelia. It is a smaU state, governed by a Prince-Bishop, styled Vladika, over whom the Sultan exercises the right of sovereignty. It is about 2,500 mUes square, and contains 60,000 inhabitants. Itis situate onthe south-east of the Herzegovina, and is nearly surrounded by Albania, a province of the Turkish empire, which in ancient times formed the kingdom of King Pyrrhus. Montenegro, which was for a long time unknown in consequence of its difficulty of access, was peopled in the 14th century by emigrants from Servia, in consequence of its conquest byBajazet. The Montenegrins defended their independence against the Turks for nearly a century, and were finally conquered in the year 1478 by Mahomet the Second. The principal town of the State is Cettinye, situate in the centre of the country, and is composed of about 80 houses, built round a convent, strongly fortified, according to the custom of the country. The reigning Prince resides during a portion of the year at the Monastery of Stagnovitcb, on the frontiers of Dalmatia, and the remainder of the year at the Monastery of St. Basil, in the valley of Schinizza. These religious houses are real fortresses, and have been often successfully defended against the Sultan. The tomb of the Princess Jeanne Kastria, sister of the celebrated Scanderbeg, is seen in one of those monasteries. The Montenegrins are all warriors, from the Princo to the humblest of his subjece ; but, unfortunately, they frequently confound the love of country with the love of plunder. They are Slaves by descent, and speak a dialect similar to the Servian language. They profess a religion which Is a mixture of the Servian and the Greek Church. This small state, of which a portion is remarkable for its agricultural wealth, has but few roads. One leads from Cattaro along the coast to ScutarL Another goes into the Herzegovina, passlng through defilme which are so well fortified as to be impregnable."
The Pays has the following on the treaty with Persia:-
" It is now beyond dispute that Persia attacked the independent State of Herat from purely religious causes; but, whatever may have been the cause of war, it was impossible that England could leave that city in the power of Persia, inasmuch as Herat, situate on the route to India, gives access, by Candahar and Cabul, to British India. The city of Herat, then, is to be given up, and the state of which it is the capital is to be placed, with regard to Persia, in the same state it was in before the war.
"The Court of Teheran, notwithstanding this restitu. tion, preserves a great moral advantage, that of having van. quished the Affghans, assisted its coreligionists, and remained the legal protector of the Mussulmans of the sect of AIlt
" The renewalof the commercialconventions between the two countries places England on the footing cf the mo3t favoured nations. As a special advantage it concedes the right for the Euphrates Railroad Company to have, on paying an annual rent, stations on the Persian Gulf,particu larly at Karrak, at Ormuz, and at the mouth of the Euphrates. The cone ession is for 99 years, the term of the duration of the company.
" Great Britain will, in common with other countries that have treaties of commerce with Persia, have the power to establish new Consular posts. The rights of these agents will be defined in virtue of a special convention, but they are debarred from taking Persian subjects under the protection of England.
" England demanded, it is said, at the first conference, the dismissal of the Grand Vizier. Such a demand was as unjust as it was impossible, for the Grand Vizier had committed no fault; and, as he was the personal friend of the sovereign, the latter would have been humiliated in the eyes of his own subjects. This demaud-which the English negotiator at Constantinople would never give up-was abandoned during-the Paris conferences.
"Persia has made a reasonable moral concession by consenting to receive Mr. Murray, to whom aU the honours which are due to foreign representatives on entering on their functions will be paid. Mr. Murray was the cause of the rupture between the two countries; it is now proved that all the fault was on his side, sud yet England was right in demanding his return to Teheran, for, in consequence of the fanaticism of the population of the capital, there would be no security in fature for English subjects if Mr. Murray had not received reparation, which, however, he does not merit il the eyes of Europeans.
" As to the evacuation of Bushire, and of the other points now occupied by English troops, it was obligatory to such a degree that it can only be regarded as a secondary circumstance."
The foUowing private telegraphic despatch has been received:-

In reference to the presentation to the Emperor Louis Nfapoleon of the ancient palace at Jerusalem, the former residence of the Knights of St. John, some particulars relative to the order may not be without interest.
The military order of the Knights Hospitalers was founded by Gerard Tour, who was born at Martigues, in Provence. After the capture of Jerusalem he established in that city, in the year 1099, a house of refuge, for the purpose of giving an asylum to the pilgrims who were in the habit of coming from all parts of the Christian world to visit the Holy Places. Raymond Dupuy succeeded Gerard as Grand Master of the order. He decided that the order should in future become military as well as hospitaller, and that it should defend by arms the Christians 'against the infidel2k The order thenceforth, assumed the title of Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. When Saladin obtained possession of Palestine, in the year 1188, the Knights quitted Jerusalem to establish themselves at Acre, subsequently at Rhodes and in the year 1530 in the Island of Malta, which was given them by Charles V. The French Government long coveted the ruins of the establshment at Jerusalem, as belonging to France by right, Which, since the Crusades to the present day, has always assumed to represent in the East the military spirit of the West, and to be in that country the most piousand most stedfast supporter of Catholic interests.
The Council of State has not yet fixed a day for resuming the discussion on the bil imposing a tax on personal property.
M. Amanthon, the Bishop lately appointed for Ispahan and Teheran, had a private audience this morning of the Emperor. He is shortly to leave Paris, and to embark at Marseilles for Trebizonde.
It is said that the Emperorihas offeredthe Spanish Government to act aS mediator in the difference3 with Mexico. Some French ships of warhave been ordered to cruise off Vera Cruz.
It is announced that a camp is to be established on the Marne, eight miles from Chalons-sur-Marne, and two miles from the small village of Suippell. It will be placed between the three small rivers, Suippe, Noblisse, and Vesle. Last autumn a Government agent was sent into the department to purchase 35,000 acres of land, mostly uncultivated. He found considerable difliculty, in consequence of the small
portions into which landed property is divided in the department of the Marne. A great number of proprietors, however, readily consented to sell on reaso3fable terms. With others it was found neces-
sary to put the law in force, and proceedings against them are being instituted by the Prefect of the department. The landed proprietors in general are well aware that the country will gain considerably by the establishment of a camp on a barren Eoil. M!anure ii very scarce in the neighbourhood of Chalons, and it is well known how much an uncultivated tract is enriched by the neighbourhood of a camp. A company of sappers are already at work, under the command of captains Weynaud and Rouband. A portion of the matried of the camp of Boulogne has arrived at Chalons, and it is expected that the troops will be all encamped before the end of spring. A wooden hut has been prepased, after
which the camo is to be modelled.
The Neuchaktel question is going On slowly. There
was no conference to-day, and there wi probably be none held before Saturday.
I have already mentioned that Marshal Randon had attended the Council of Ministers since his arrival in Paris. The subject was the long talkedof expedition to Kabylia. Marshal Randon thought the force he had at his disposal in Algeria was not sufficient for such a purpose, but it appears that Marshal Vaillant, Minister-at-War, showed clearly that with his present force such a thing was possible. MIarshal Randon is anything but satisfied with the result. The expedition, though on a small scale, will, however, be executed.
On the anniversary of the birth of the littlo Imperial Prince a great number of promotions in the army will be made, including, I believe, every grade, except of course that of Marshal. A considerable number of decorations, crosses, and medals will be distribute d on the same occasion. The little Prince himself will also, I hope, get his promotion on the same occasion.

RUSSIA.
(RoMr oUR gRLnf CORsPONDnsNT.)
BERLIN, MAxCu 10.
Very recently the new Minister of Police in St. Petersburg, Count Schuwaloff, assembled round him all the officers of the constabulary branch of the police force, and strictly charged them to enjoin on all their subordinates the necessity of observing tho utmost politeness towards all with whom they might come in contact; he had, as he told them, lately visited London, Paris, Vienna, and Berln, and had seen how politeness on the part of the police was perfectly compatible with a strict and conscientious discharge of their duties. An opportunity for the fulfilment of these orders was pointed out as likely to be offered by the revelries inseparable from the Carnival; and the privates of the force received their instructions, accordingly, only in the most extreme case to take up any offender, after previously exhausting every available amicable means for maintaining order.
Some of the orders recently issued by the police are interesting, as showing the existence of a state of things very different from what obtains with us. Thus, an Imperial ukase lately issued repeals a standing order of the .Edile police, which required that all houses should have an odd number of windows in front; it is now permissible for persons bauilding to have either an odd or an even number of windows towards the street, just as they please. A proclamation of the chief of the St. Petersburg police states that, in spite of all former warnings, apprentices are allowed to go about the streets insufficiently clad; all owners and masters of industrial establishments are strictly enjoined to watch over the due fulfilment of the existing regulations in this respect, and the superintendents and their subordinates in their different districts are made responsible for their proper execution. As the juxtaposition of other orders shows, the above regulations have been issued not so much for decency's sake as for sanitary reasons ; for instance, all police officials are required to use great vigilance in the prevention of insufficient and unventilated accommodation being provided for the working classes. It is pointed out that many establishments at their first opening perfectly satisfied the requirements of the inspectors with respect to the accommodation provided for the number of workmen at that time employed, but that this accommodation was not always extended in proportion to the increase of the *orkpeople, so that the latter were often obliged to sleep in close and circumscribed closets. Finally, the proclamation added that the surest means of preserving the health of the working classes was the observance of a regular and moral life on their part; masters and employers were therefore called upon to seek to improve the morality of their workpeople by all kind and gentle means, and more particularly to see that they do not neglect their Christian duties andattendance at church.
Persons engaged in the conveyauce of goods through the town by cart or other conveyance ara strictly forbidden to load their vehicles with greater weights than the horses can draw, and then to use violence and cruelty and loud cries to urge the poor animals forward with their excessive loads. The masters are to be held responsible for their servants overloading their horses; and the carmen themselves, who nevertheless do this aud then treat their horses cruelly and block up the streets, will be carried off to the various police-offices and there made to turn scavengers.
An officer of the Guard who lately returned to the Crimea writes to the Academy .Tour?wl a description of the altered appearance of the country from what it was three years ago. All about Simpheropol and along the southern coast the ravages of war are still very apparent; many places look II as though the enemy had left them only yesterday." The Greeks and Tartars, who formerly monopolized all trade and commerce in the Crimea, have been entirely ruined by the war, and now the great men in every branch 'of business are Jews, who have many of them made plenty of money, particularly in Simpheropol, during the war, where also the labouring classes have profited greatly by the great demand for labour during that period. According to another account, publshed in the Invalide, the progress made in the rebuilding of Sebastopol is not quite so great as certain reports had given us to understand. The indemnifications that the Government had undertaken to pay to those subjects whose property had beep destroyed there during the war are not to be paid till this summer, and in the absence of these funds there are very few persons found in a position to commence building. Such of the former inhabitants or such new settlers as liad arrived there have contented themselves hitherto with temporary habitations knocked up out of the remains of the English and French huts. During the autumn divers ha been busily at work in the harbour in their endeavours to recover the sunken ships. The correspondent of the rnvalh4e was present at the moment when one vessel was successfully hfted above the water's level, and greeted by the enthusiastic cheers of a numerous crowd assembled on the occasion. The dress of the divers employed in the harbour of Sebastopol agrees exactly with that which is familiar to all visitors of the Polytechnic EEx
ibDltlon in zegent-street,' Since JEalaklava was evacuated by our countrymen it has been taken possession of by an army of fierce rats, who not only consume every object of still life within their reach, but also at night time attack people in the streets; this native enemy has been found so formidable that the inhabitants who had returned to their former dvellings were obliged to vacate them again, and trust to the severities of winter to diminish the forces of the four-footed enemy. It is the prevailing opinion in Sebastopol at present that the town has never been taken by the enemy, and this is considered as proved by the allegation that even after September 7 the French flag was planted only on the Malakhoff, and not in the town itself.
SPAIN.
(Toxr oUR oWN eOPO!ENDT.)
MADRID, M EAnO 7. The probability of hostilities with Mexico be '
to excite a good deal of attention here. The afair is complicated. On the one hand, the Government is loth to go to war with that republic, lest its operations should in some way give a pretext for umbrage to the United States, of which Power it stands in awe. The dislike to risk a dispute 'with what the Spanish papers are wont to call the North American Clossus is augmented by a refusal whichl
I san asrd, has be-en received from En:rlaud and. France to the application made to them {o,r protec-. tion for the island of Cuba while an expedition went against Mexico.
A special envoy from the Mexican Government, Senor La FraP s, is maid to have asrved at South.
Iampton, and to be on hs way to Madrid, charged
it, explanations respecting te reoent outrages on Stpanish residents in the territory of the republic. Untihe has been heard, and until the receipt of despatches from the Spanish Minister at Mexico, now on the road and exDected here next week, no final decision wil be tiken b the Government.
leanwhile, preparations kontinue. Five large venWs are getting ready to leave Cadiz with troops, and the officers ordered on this service have received orders to hold themselves in readiness for prompt departure. The plan of the Spanish Government is the following:-lt is proposed to fetch General Santa Anna from Carthagena (South America), where he at present is, and whence he willhave sent instructions to his partisans inMexico. Vera Cruz is to be taken in his name, and with Spanish aid; his adherents wil be in readiness to join him, and to march uponthe capital. This project has probably had its origin in an application which is known to have been made to Spain a short time ago by Santa Anna for a large number of officers to head an attempt he was contemplating. It is thought that the capture of Vera Cruz is spoken of rather too confidently, as a thing sure to be at once effected. San Juan d'Ulloa passes for one of the strongest fortresses in the two Americas, and although the French, favoured by circumstances and by a very feeble resistance, captured it in 1838, it does not necessarily follow that it is to faU an easy prey to -the Spaniards in 1857.
Notwithstanding the news lately received, vid England, of a blockade by Spanish men-of-war of the Mexican ports, it is doubted whether this can be effective and sustained, the more so as the northerly gales, usual in those latitudes at this season, would render it difficult and dangerous for a squadron to remain off the Mexican coast.
AU the troops that are as yet known to be under orders for Cuba are about 2,000 men, draughts from different regiments, and which in any case would be sent later in the year to fill up the vacancies caused by deaths and oompletion of service in the ranks of the army in the Spanish West Indies. It is asserted, however, that in addition to these a sufficient body of troops could be spared from Caba to form the expedition against Mexico.
There is a strong report to-day that the present .Premier's tenure of offlice is very insecure. He is said to be hankering after the Paris Embassy, of which it has been decided to raise the salary to 40,0(O0 dollars. His wish to exchange the labours and responsibilities of President of the Council for the pleasanter post of Ambassador to the Tuileries is not, however, the main cause assigned for his possible resignation. He is believed to be in very bad odour with the Queen. There is talk of a letter written by him in 1854, in reply to an application made to him by O'Donnell to join the proposed insurrection against the Sartorius Government. His answer was, that he would take part in no movement unless one of its objects was a change in the reigning dynasty. There are strong reasons for believing that some such letter exists, and O'Donnell is said to have lately communicated it to the Queen, when urged by her to accept office under Narvaez, as a conclusive reason for his declining to do so. Such a breach of confidence would be characteristic of the man who has contrived to betray or disgust every party to which he has hitherto professed tobelong.
With the rumours of Ministerial chauges is connected the departure of Senor Mon for Rome, which took place this morning. It is thought that he is gone to consult with Queen Christina, and that he will then return to Madrid, under pretext of taking his seat in the Cortes, but, in reality, to occupy an important post in a new Ministry. Queen Christina's reported return to France will not, it is believed, takle place as yet. The Espana, usually well informed with respect to her proceedings, positively affirms this, and also that she has ordered some furniture she has here to be sent to Rome and Paris, and that she has no present intention of coming to Spain. She knows that she is anything but a favourite here, and probably has not yet forgotten the alarm and peril she passed through in 1854.

I neither lelieve in "patent (political) medicines," nor takethem. In what I do believe I may be wrong, but I am not rabid.

Inow hold houses in two parishes, and for myself and others am responsible for poor-rates in St. Pancras and St. Bride's. The poor-rates eat me up. I am kept poor by being compeUed to upport the poor. Yet, if the money went to the helpless, the sick, and superannuated I should not complain; but what doithe authonties do with It? Thev feed a w ole army of stout wenches upon it, who smash windows, turn the workhouse inside out, and now and then double up the master and matron; or they expend it upon the gastronomical department of what they candidly enopgh confess are "ablebodied" paupers-fellows ten times better able than I am to work for their bread, and who are able to di"est bread and cheese by the barrow-load and garotte the whole board of guardians when they have done. And this precious game is played all over the land. Why do you not pour a few of your detergent leaders tbrough those Augean stables of legal mendicity-parish boards ?
Blue-book readers remember the evidence of Mr. Nathaniel Driver, of Ferneux Pelhaim, Hertfordshire. Whlt a picture he drew of honest English parish Boards, reduced to dodging tricky bastardy and chasmg rn,tic rouds; and this is the kind of farce they play with pauperism. What are the Poor Laws exoept legalized Robin-Hoodism-taling from the rich and giving to the poor-a species of incoherent Communism without the organization of industry? My friend Ebenezer Elliott used to amse me by reciting his satiric lines-
"Whast a communist? One wbo has yeamrnings For equ division Of unequal earnings; Idler or bungler, or both, he is wining
To fork out his penny and Pocket Your shilling.'
Mr. Cobden and half the House of Commons believe in this epigram to this day. They ought to know better. I who have spent my life among our working class declare that I never knew a single Communist of this base quality on this English soil of ours. But I say parishes cultivate this vile growth. Havo we not London vuagistrates telling mobe of people to go to the parish, saying, ",There is no degrdation in it"? There is degradation In it. There is always de tion in living upon alms. It is a bad lesson to give the people. My counsel (which you would 4 priori suspect) zo my friends is, "N Never go to the parisb." Not because I think the workhouse masters all
ard-hearted or guardians always insolent. That is trash. The maniacal- atd the superannuated may, if friendless, honestly bless the hand that lays them on the pnrish mattrass; but as for the man with sense and strength, let him demand a manlier fate. As the mechanic passes down the street let no shopk=ee be able to say, " There goes a feUow I raised,' as the Yaikees have it, on the parish estate. The blood in his body is one stream of mendicity. The phosphate of lime in his bones came out of the poor-rates. The very nose on his face cost us Is. lOd. in the pound. Every house in the parish owns a bit of him, and, if each ratepayer had his own, there would not be an atom of him left." If the unemployed have no right to live, abolsh them honestly - but, if they have a right to life, let them live like other men-by the swvet of the brain or sweat of the brow, without charity or degradation. It has been shown in the State paver to which Is have before referred that this can be done m:England, and it will be of little use reading homilies to poverty until it is done. Mr. Charles Pearson proves that prisoners might support themselves; Mr. Rowland Hill shows that the destituto might support themselves without poor-rates on our barren acres. Iet this be done, ana a hundred wvill emigrate with a vaorous cheerfulness for one w ho now, dreary, displzited4 and incapable, finds his reluctant way to the coast. I end as I began-Home colonies would be the normal schools of emigrants.
I am. Sir. sour obedient srvant.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONBY-MARKBT4nd
Thursday Evening.
The English funds remain without improvement, and tho transactions of the day have been wholly miimportant. Consols for money again opened and closed at 931 to J, although for a moment they touched 93S. For the 8th of April the last transactions were at 93g to 1. New Three per Cents. were quoted 921 to i; lndia Stock, 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to ;; India-bonds, 3s. digcount to par; and Exchequer-bills, par to Ss. premium.
There was an undiminished demand for money to-day, both in the discount-market and at the Bank of England.
Foreign securities have exhibited greater firmness, and in some cases there was a decided improvement. Mexican advanced on purchaes a half per cent., and Peruvian was also rather higher. The general operations were more numerous. In Turkish Six per Cents. the bargains were at 97 and 971 for money, and 97j and 97 for the account; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14k; l7ew Granada Active, 22k; the Deferred, 6O; Mexican, for account, 22i and 23; Peruvian, for money, 78, 78# 79, and 781; the Three per Cents., 556; Portji
guese Three per Cents.., 46 and J; the Three per Cents., 1856, 43; Sardiian Five per Cents., go}
Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 41 ; the New Deferred, for account, 25k and 244; Spanish Certificates of Coupon not funded, Oi anu i ; butch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65k; and the tour per Cent. Certificates, 99g.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 75c. for money and 71f. for the end of the month, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent., consequent upon speculative sales.
The late arrivals of Austvslian gold were delivered to-day, and nearly the whole was purchased on account of the Bank of France. The remainder scarcely sufficed for the general wants of the market, and about 5,0001. was taken from the Bank.
The telegraphic report of the Incia and China exchanges shows no material variation since the last mail, but the tendency is rather unfavourable. At Bombay the rate is stiU 2s. lid.; at Calcutta it is 2s. 2jd., showing an adverse movement of about a half per cent. ; and at Canton and Shanghai the quotations remain respectively at 4s. 9d. and Os. 8d. Under these circumstances there is likely to be a sustained demand for silver, especially bar silver.
Although the first signs of a revival of speculation at Paris are likely to be followed by an attempt to introduce the Russian railway scheme, all apprehension of its finding favour on this side seems completely to have passed away. Never was a project of any magnitude brought forward with so few features to allow even of a temporary delusion being got up with regard to it, sand nothing could be more appropriate than the utter indifference with which it has been received. In Paris, however, it is not altogether improbable that a different result may be witnessed. All the houses most famous on the Bourse are comnmitted to it, not merely in name, but in pocket, and it will be strange if such a combination should fail after the fact, just witnessed, of a single and comparatively unimportant individual having been able to raise 3,000,001. for a Government like that of Spain, branded with insolvency and confiscation. From the circumstance of the Emperor having removed the interdict against its being advertised and recommended in the journals it may be assumed also that it will be tolerated, if not encouraged, by the Court. With capitalists, the press, and the Government united more or less in its behalf, and with all the avenues to correct information and independent discussion thoroughly closed, the concoctors of premiumts have everything in their favour, and are not likely to remain iu their present predicament from want of skill or exertion. The Russian Government, who are already believed in the concession granted to have greatly modified their terms from those first contemplated, in order to attract subscribers, will doubtless also make every further arrangement that may increase the time and opportunities of their friends. Hence, althoughhthe scheme from thelame delays in its introduction has been much tarnished even in Paris, the contingency of its being accepted is not altogether out of the question. Every week of hesitation, however, increases the proofs of the distrust of its promoters as to their being able to float it. The difficulty is that they will apparently have to assume the 3,400,0001. proposed to be extracted from England in addition to the more moderate sum of 2,500,0001. originaUy contemplated to be drawn from France. Should the
rench people suffer themselves to be pledged to supply this total of 5,900,0001., which is still ouly an instalmnent of what is to be required from them in order to complete the 45,000,0001. to be expended in ten years, it will be interesting to observe the results, both monetary and political, when the drain from its heavy and uninterrupted calls shall be found not only to depress all other securities, but to excite by its action on the money-market universal irritation among the commercial classes.
The annexed lettpr relates to the measuro contemplated by the local Government of Victoria with regard to the note circulation of that colony:-
,"Sir,-With reference to the paragraph in your monoy articleoof this -orS respecting the establishment of a
national bank of issuo m Victoria, I may state for the information of your readers that most of the existing banks hold charters from the Legislature of that colony which expremly give them tho power to issue notes for periods extending from 14 to 21 years. Tho Bank of New Soath Wales and the Bank of Victoria, in particnlar, may bo mentioned, and, as tho proprietors of these institutions aro on the spot, they are not very likely to permit any:measure so immediately affecting their interests topa without a strong opposiiton.
But, as the old rinistry did not possess the confidence of the country, the mail of the 23d of July, now expected,
lprobably inform uS that this measre has gone overboard with its authors.
"A national bank of issue was tried in New Zoaland, and has become a completo failure.
" Your obedient servant,
"March 12. " g. .
The following particuLars of the passenger traffic between England and the Continent during the past year, as compared wvith 1855, have been gathered from statements just furnished from the various ports:
XSSO. 1855.
Boulogne .99,034 13S.331 calis.. .. 53 .. 50393
Dieppe .. .. .. .. 3t s 5. 39,311
Tayre .. .. .. .. 16,415 20.765 Dundirk .. .. .. . 12.. 2,435 Ostend. 21,501 .. I5,993 Antwerp. 17017 .. 15,315
ToWa. 2 274033 .. 313,5ss
The fallingoff observablo in the French traffic is entirelyattributable to the exceptional developement it attained in 1855 in consequence of the Paris Exhibition. The augmentation at Calais and the Belgian ports seems to indicate an Increasing traffic with Belgium, Germany, and the North of Europe, partly attributable, perhaps, to the reopening of relations with Russia.
Advices from Sweden state that the traffic on the Royal Swedish Railway, so far as the line is open, is exhibiting a satisfactory increase.
The satisfactory intelligence was' received this afternoon that the Tyne steamer has been safely brought into dock at Southampton.
The Violet has arrived from Foo-chow-Foo with 584,6001b. of tea.
Among recent publications has been the ninth volume of the collection of the Treaties and Conventions between Great Britain and Forcign Pou,ers, by Mr. Lewis Hertslet, the Librarian of the Foreignofflce.* It contains many new treaties with the
native chiefs of Afriea and of Arabia, and with the nativo Princes and States of India, exhibiting our relations of intercourse, conmmerce, and navigation with their extensive coasts and countries. The new commercial treaties with Abyssinia, Japan, Paraguay, the Sandwich Islands, &c., are also included, together with the regulations of the different countries of the world respecting the exercise of religion by Protestants, and other matters intereating to British subjeets abroad, and the laws relating to merchant shipping, the whole being brought to a very recent period. MIr. Wyld has issued three new maps connected with questions of the day-namely, of the Canton River, the lEudson's Bay territory, and Livingston's dsoverles; and llIr. Effingham Wilson has reprinted the letters on Interest and Discount, by "A Merchant," which lately appeared
in The Times, and attracted attention.

FIRE IN PLEET-STREET.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A most exaggerated and incorrect statement of tho fire which unfortunatelyocourrod on our premises in Whiwe friars-street lastevening having appeared in your paper this morning, we beg to state, for the satisfaction of our customers and friends in particular, and the public in general, that, although we have suffered severely, and shall certainly be inconvenienced by the damage done yet it has been excessively magnified as to the amonnt; and so far from all tho Governmont plates and dies being destroyed, all the postage dies and e>xcise slates, and nearly all the postage plates, are preserved uninjured, as a1so are all our private plates; and there is no danger of the public being in any way inconvenienced by this calarmity.
We are, ~Sir, yomr obedient servants,

TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you permit me to correct a mistake in the report of the fire in Fleet-street in your paper of this day? In speaking of the floating steam fire engine your reiorter sys, "by setting both engines into full operation, &c, "the air-veasel of the steam float gavo way, owing to the backpressure on tho valves. This, of courso, preventod the engino being of any further assistance."
I beg to inform you that thero are two distinct steamn engines, boilers, and fira-englnes on board the float; ohe pair only were set to work when the air-vessel was blown off. All that was necessary to work the second pair was to shut one slide-cock and open another which would have beea done immediately but that the fire was nearly exEn. guished.
The cause of the accident was the rrat length of hose put on wupwards of 1,200 feet), and the evel of the fire ben 60 fet 6 inches above the float, which caused a p re o
upwards of lOOlb. on the square-inch in tho air-veasel or over 30,0001b. direct pressure on the top of it. I
So little was the floatlng-engine affected by the accident that she started at 2.30 a.m. the same moring to a fire down the river, ready to throw 1,200 gallons of water per minuto, but was stopped on the way, as her servioes were not required.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient srnmt.

BAIL WAY AND MININz4 SHiBBS.
Thursday Evening.
The general tone of business in the railway-market to-day was rather more favourable, and prices showved greater steadiness. A recovery occurred in Midland, York, Newcastle, and Berwick, and York and North Midland, but in other cases there was -partial heaviness. Indian were firmer, and French andBelgian advanced, espeoially Sambre and Meuse, on a vague report of negotiations for a guarantee. Miscellaneous shares were dealt ia to a moderate extent, quotations having been fairly supported to the close. Australian Bank shares were rather flat, owing to a few sales. Canada land were purchased at 155 and 157, and closed 155 to 100. Riga shares left off 2i to i; Punjab, i to J pm.; and Northern of Bengal, par to i pm.

The LORD CHANCELLOR intimited that his noble and learned friends Lord St. Leonard's and Baron Wenaleydale were shareholders in the London and North-Western hailway Company, and he wished to know whether any objection on behalf of the parties would be made to those noble lords hearing and deciding the cause.
Mr. ROLT, on behalf of tho appellants, said that so far as regarded his clients he was sure no such objection would be made,-in fact, as there had been a variety of conflicting decisions in the case he prayed that those noble and learned lords would hear the case.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that if ho were speaking for himself he should not have had the slightest objection to the noble lords referred to deciding the cause ; but, after a recent decision in the Court of Common Pleas, he could not assent to that arrangement without the sanction of his clients.
The LoRD CaACELLOR said that he trusted the Attorney-General would not object to Baron Wensleydale sitting as a sort of assewpor.
The ATToRNEY-GExzRAL said he thought he might assent to that arrangement.
Lord St. Leonard's accordingly withdrew, and Baron Wensleydale remained upon the understanding that he was to give no judgment.
Whis was an appeal from the decision of the Lords Justices, affirming a decree of the Master of the Rolls pronounced in a suit for the specific performance of an agree. ment instituted by the appellants, as plaintiffe against the respondents,. as defendants. The Lords Justices having degsded against the appellants, the present appeal was brought.
T'he arguments wrere not concluded when their Lordships adjourned.

James Boott 2, om oibus cnductor, surrendered to take his trial foz embezzling money received by him in the capacity of servant to the London General Omnibus Com. pany.
Mr. Seigh and Mr. F. I. Leivs appeared for the proEecution; Mr. Metcalfe was counsel for the pnsoner.
The evidence in support of tho present indictment, which contained three counts charging the prisoner with having appropriated to himself three fares which be had received as a conductor on one of the company's omnibuses on one day, was similar to that adduced on a like charge on which he was tried and acquitted on Wednesday. The -witnesses were persons who had cen specially employed to ride in the prisoner's omnibus to make memoranda of the fares paid to him by passengers.
3r. METCAI.E subjected them to a severe cross-examina. tion, and made a very forcible address to the jurv.
After the learned JuDaz had summed up,
The uiry retired, as they did in the former case, and, after de'berating for about four hours, they found the prisoner NYot Guil4,.
The prisoner was liberated on bail, to appear to take his trial on a third indictment.

GRIfLLIL.-A tal, thin young man, named Gifford, was placed in the felons' dock before Alderman ILwlmr,CE charged with the following daring robbery :-
Mr. Scanlon said,-I left New Bridge-street last night a few minutes past 10 o'clock, and was proceeding through Fleet-street towards my home, when I was stopped by a crowd near Wine Ofice-court, immediately opposite the fire. The prisoner and several other persons were rushing to and fro, and at length they surrounded me, and the prisoner.
acmg fhimself very close in front of me, looked me Iul in the face, with practised boldness pulled open my outside coat, which was buttoned, with such violence that he tore away the buttons and then thrust his hand forcibly into my waistcoat poeket and took my gold watch, which cost 20 guineas. I saw'him pass it to a man dressed in fustian, who was standingbyhim, and immediately made off with it by stooping and working his way through the crowd. I attempted to follow him, but was impeded by his associates, who closed round me, and prevented me from getting out of the crowd. I then secured the prisoner never having left or lost sight of him for an instant, and handed him over to the custody of the officer. I felt his hand pulling at my watch, and when I got out of the crowd I found my Albert guard hanging loose from the buttonhole of my waistcoat.
Prisoner.-Did vou see me take the watch?
Mr. Scanlon.-aertainy; and with the greatest deliberation and determination. There was no attempt at disguise in the matter. It was done with the most daring boldness
Police-constable 286, said,-I took the prisoner into custody, and, with the assistance of several firemen, I succeeded withgreat difficulty in getting him from the crowd. A nmob of his companions then tried to get him away, but I afterwards took him to the station.
Alderman LAwstsCE committed the prisoner for triaL Prisoner.-Cannot you deal with it summarily?
Alderman L&WsxNCz.-Certainly not. The case is too serious to be disposed of in that way.
The prisoner was then removed.
Bow-STRET.-A letter-carrier named Thomas Nichols was chlar,ed with stealig a money letter.
The prisoner was on duty that morning at the General Post-omfice, and was engaged In stamping letters, when some suspicion having arisen in the mnid of Mr. Clare, inspector of letter-carriers, he watched the prisoner very closely and presently saw him abstract a letter and put it under waistcoat. HeorderedBinghama, the officer, to bring the prisoner to his (Mr. Clare's) room and search him which was done, and the letter was found upon him. It was a genuine letter, and contained two sixpences and a tbreepenny piece.
The prisoner said that the letter got under his waistcoat by accident, as he was carrying a pile of letters in his arms pressed against his chest.
He was committed for triaL
WzST.NXSTER.-2s. were yesterday received from "A Poor Gentleman," for Mrs. Allen, with a request that it should be acknowledged in nTc Times. The benevolent donor, in reading the report of the case, a few days ago, which has attracted hLs ympathy, must have overlooked the announcement in conclusion, that the woman' in question was fairly started on the road to Brighton, and, such being the case, the 2s. cannot be given her, but will be returned on application, or applied as may otherwise be requested.
Wossap-STsRE.-Mary CarneY, a woman who has been repeatedly charged with CtR of violence at this court, was charged before Mr. HIrmna with wantonly ssaulting Mr. Brushfield, chairman of the board of guardians of the Whitechapel Union.
This case lay in a very smal compass, and was simply that the woman was introduced to the board-room to have her case investigated, got enraged upon being questioned, and hurled her shoe at the complainant, Mr. Brushfield, striking him violently on the head, and afterwards, upon an attempt being made to remove her, assaulted ono of the oflicers of the house.
Mr. Hs11m characterized the womans conduct as very scandalous, and fined her in two penalties of 54 and 40s. each, or in default three mnontW consecutive imprisonmnent in the House of Correction.
At the conclu,ion of this case Mr. Brushfiield sald,-I wil now take this opportunity, Sir, of referring to the report of a case in 27w Tames newpa.per of Monday last, respeeting a man named Wiliam Wlliams or Willson, who is alleged to have come here attended by a gentleman named Martin, to complainof having been turned out of our workhouse. I wish to say that there is not one word of truth in that reprt.
eW. HAwAuLT-Yes, Iperfectly well remember the case, and a most shocking appearance the man presented. What is your object in now referring to it ?
Mr. Brushfield.-To denythe satement; there is not one word of truth in it.
Mr. H rA ssnr..-Do I understand you rightly? Do you mean to deny that such a person,-blind of one eye, lame, and aged,-waa brought before me by Mr. Mlartin ?
Mr. Brushlield.-No, Sir, I don't say that, but I wish to know if such statements were mde here as were reported In She Times.
Mr. HAmxnmL.-Yes, the facts were rather understated than otherwise; a most melancholy object the man pre,ented.
Mr. Brushfield.-Then, I can only say that the statement is entirely false; there is not a wora of truth in it. On a former occasion I was publicly charged by this same Mr. Martin with having violated a promLise that the claims of the poor should be properly attended to, and that is utterly wrong, as all deserving obiects have been promptly attended to since I last had oocasion to attend at this court.
Mr. EL.-ms.-That is wholly irrelevant to the present matter, with reference to which I must ssy that I was extremely shocked to hear that a man 76 years of age, 'nfir, and obviously unable to sustain himself by anv x:ertion he conld make, should be turned out of a worLhouse upon the promise of ashilling a-week ad a loaf for three
Mr. Brushfield.-He was not turned out, Sir, and was allowed the option of recdving the 3s. at once, or Is. weekly, as he chose.
Mfr. HAmnsLL.-I must confess I was grieved to hear that the chairman of any board of guardians should allow sch a man to go out of the house upon those or any terms,
asit must, I should think, have been as manifest then as it as when before me that a man 76 years of age and ruptured eould not support himsel£, Who was the chrirman then, Sir?
Mr. Brushfleld.-I was the chairman, and in my opiMr. EAaIm L.-I wrould rather not hear your opinion Sir; as a reasonable man you should have known that which was quite evident to all here-the man's physical inability to earn his own living; and, even alowing he expressed a desire to leave the house, I think you should have sent him to the medied offlicer and if necessary, induced him to reason with and point out to the man the utter folly of his leavirgthe utifon, Why, he was so feeble, lame, and incapacitated while hero beforo me that I ordered him to be 'sent back in a cab.
Mr. Bru3hfield.-The man came before the board and made application for an allowance and, if persons wish to et out of the house, we have neitier the power nor right to I ock them in.
Mr. HAae-rso-But that allowance, even if the object is fit to go ont, shuld not bea shilling a-week and a loaf.
Mr. Brushfield.-Then, Sir, another part of the statement s s of the casual ward being closed, and a notification to that effect being over the gates.
Mr. HA1.L-.-And is that not so?
Mr. Brashfield.-That certainly may be the case, but the applicants are alwavs admitted. Then, again, 27e Time report states that the old man was kept at work in the stoneyard from U1 o'clock tiU 4 without food. [It is necessary to say the gentleman -was mistaken on this point; 27c Times report contained no such statement about the stoneyard. The vords were "that he had to pick oaknm fromU o'clock til 4 without food," a labour which the reporter beleves is not carnied onin the stoneyard.]
Mr. E&sn,L.-I recollect he said that he picked oakam for that time under such privation.
Mr. Bruslifeld.-And that is perfectly false. He has, since his zeadmission by your desire, been before the board anl expressed regret that he should have made any auch statement. Again, on the heel of all this the report makes allusion to the circumstance of three bodies being found in the paish, either dexa or dying; and it certainly appears as If an inncliation existed to cast a slur upon the parih authorities, whose duties, it is well known, are difficult and onerous enough as it is.
Mr. EH ieWLL-Well, I can only tell- you that all those points to which you have alluded were mentioned here by
. Martin in his statement, and greatly shocked I was to hear them. And in reference to this explanation I must say that you have yourself substantially confirmed the old mars relation to me, whereas you asserted that not one word was truLe. I mnst go on with the other business of the court
Mr. Bruadfield thereupon retired, and subsequently a careworn-looking woman, with an infant in her arms,ame cryingto the magistrate and said,-.I have been turned from the doors of Witechapel workhouse, Sir, like a dog. lam asoldier'swifeo,and he is at Lisbon, Myv name in So phis Smith, and mny husband, wvho 3s 3n the Mainns has ben Fone nine monthst. I was compelled to go to the workhouse ecauseI can get my money from my husband. There aro two 155., a-month payments owing to me, but they say at the. Admiralty that it is atorped for the present. The
gateman at the workhous pushed me away, and xaid, "Go away, go away- come to-morrow."
Mr. H3mTz.-Aut meanwhile son might starve.
Thomagistrate kindly examinedth woman's papers, and, eeing that her representation was supported bfy them, ordered the warrant officer of tho district to tee that she vas properly taken care of until sho could again engage the attention of the parish authorities.
Mr. HAINDUI in the course of yesterday received a letter from Mr. Farr, clerk to the board of guardians, containing a long enclosure embracing certain resolutions passed by the board of guardians in relation to this case, in which they stated that they had thoroughly investigated all the circumstances of it, and stigmatized the whole statement made by lr. Martin, a philanthropic member of the Corn-Exchange, and his unfortunate prottvd, whose name rightly appears to be Wilison, as so distorted that the little truth in it was scarcely distinguishable. The most appropriate part of these resolutions of the board was the conclusion, in which they express their determination to have the whole matter investigated by one oE the Inspectors of the Poor Law Board, and order a copy of the resolutions to be sent to MIr. Hammill and Mr. Martin;*but they were not so modestly couched as might have been, and read strangely a'ter MIr. Brushfield's interview with the magistratc.
CLxRKExNWE -A rough, dirty, brutal-looking feUow, who gave the name of Benjamin William Pipe and de. scribed himself as a carman, appeared beforo Mr.TTRwuT= in answer to a summons charging him with cruelly ill-treating and torturing a horse, the summons being taken out at the instance of the Society for the Preventior. of Cruelty to
Animal-,
Mr. Wemyss, the superintendent of the society, attended for the prosecution.
It appeared from the evidence of some respectable witnlesses that a few days since the defendant was driving three horses in a van alongtheBagnigge-wells-roadatarapid pace, when one of them unfortunately fell down. Instead of the defendant stoppmg the other horses and getting down to help the horse up, ne commenced whipping them both in a very furious and brutal manner, the consequence of which was that the horse that had fallen down was dragged for Eome distance along the road. Some persons went and stopped the horses, and offered to lend the defendant some assistance, but he used tho most disgusting laguage towards them, and told them to mind their own business. At this time the horse 'was in a very bad state, and bleeding from two large wounds on its knees, which had been cansed by its having been dragged along the ground. The conduct of the defendant even then was most barbarous, and called forth the most indignant remarks from the bystanders, whom the prisoner threatened to fight if thoy interfered. The moment the socioty was communicated with thev took the matter up.
The prisoner, in a wining tone, said the horse feU down nd hurt itself. He did not refuse assistance or abuse any-
k John Francis Barton, one of the officers of the Royal Society for the Preservation of Life from Fire, said he was passing at the time, and offered to fetch some water to wash the horse's knees with, but the defendant refused to let him, and used very abusive laugusge towards him.
Mr. TYnwnm[ characterized the offence aM one of the most brutal that had ever come before him. The society did great good by prosecuting these charges. To mark his sense of the prisoner's conduct he should send him to the House of Correction for two calendar months, with hard labour, without the option of a fine.
The defendant, who seemed rather surprised at the decision, was then removed.
George Johnson,who is known to the police under several other aciases, and William Jones, also weU known to tho police, were placed at the bar before Mr. TYR%vv }, charged with having burglsriously broken and entered the dwellinghouse of John ^awrence in the night time, and stolen therein a box and other arEicles, his property.
The prisoners, when called upon for their defence, said they had nothing to say.
Mr. TxsiwHrT committed the prisoners to Newgate for triaL
THAm S.-Kenuto Hostim, a Swedish mariner, aged 23, was brought before Mr. YABDr.x, charged with assaultinz and wounding Geeerdis Van EAveyk, and also cutting and wounding Charles F ehx.
llr. Young said he should reserve the prisoner's defence for the sessions.
Mr. YARDLXY committed the prisoner for trial, and Felix, who was very ill, was conveyed to the hospital.
SoumTwARx.-Mr. Thomas Lintott, described on the charge-sheet as a gentleman, residing at Swanscombe, near Northfleet, and a magistrate of the county, was brought before M1r. BuRc0Hm, charged with being drank and disorderly at the South-Eastern Railhay Terminus, Londonbridge, and refusing to leave when requested
George Graves, a constable in the employ of the railway company, stated that about a quarter to 6 o'clock on the previous evening the prisoner came to the North Kent Railway station at London-bridge, and wantedto go by the train to Northfleet. The clerk, perceiving that he was intoxicated, refused to allow him to pass. He came out of the station and took a cab to go by the Blackwal lin, but h. returned twice, and entered eir station with a determiation to go by their line. Witness, seeing that he was drunk, endeavoured to persuade him to leave quietly, but it was of no use, as he stated that he would go by the next train, and
'tively refused to leavo the station. Witness, knowing im to have been drunk before and a great annoyance to the passengers on their line, was compelled to take him into custody and lock bim up.
The prisoner, who was much excited during the time witness was giving his evidence, denied that he was drank. He never was drunk in his life.
Mr. Reece, the solictor to the railway company, here informed his Worship that this was not tho first time Mr. Lintott, although a magistrate, had made his ap p neo at a police-cort charged with drunkenness, as would be aeen from the oontents of the placard produced:-
Thoas inttt.ofSwauscembe, sear S7ortJsiieet. gentleman, was
ebiamsday tbest dayof January 1857 at the Greenwich
Polce-out, 1tbelngfound. en the 18thx of beem,~berr in one of the
coumy'scariar ina sateof ntoicaienHe was oonvicted in the foil penalty s. and osD6tsallodiwed by tg cmpaus bylaws."
The prisoner told MIr. Reece that the company had no right to act as they had done towards him. Re was a magistrate and gentleman
Mr. BUBCHM asked him if ho still persisted in denying the charge of drunkenness.
He replied that he did, and that it was an ill-feelin
against him because he put the company to an expense of 2001., and did not fee the porters ashe formerly did.
Mr. Henry Dyne, station-master at the South-Eastern Railway Terminus, London-bridge, said that the prisoner was brought to his office by the last witnes shortly after 6 o'clock on the previous evening, very drunk. He complained because the company's servants refused to allow him to go by the train. Witness saw that he was drunk, and as they had orders not to let any one affected by liquor travel on their line, he told Graves to remove him from the terminus. He was afterwards given iite custody, and loeL-ed up in the station-house. Afterwards he was allowed to be liberated on bail.
Prisoner (much excited).-I was never drunk in my life and MIr. Dyne has made a mistake. There is something in the background with the company against me.
Mrr. BuncuAs-The witnesses have xworn that you were drunk. What answer have you to mrake to the
V'soner.-None, Sir. Only I was not drunk. Mr. BURCELur-Where do you reside ?
rlwsoner.-At Northfleet. I am a magistrate, Sir, and a gentleman.
lar. Reece here informed his Worehip that the prisoner some time(aso brought an action against the company for removing him from the train when he was drunk. Mr. Iintott,a surgeon and a relative, was examined on the trial, and he proved that the prisoner was of a very excitable temperament, and that at times he did not know what he
was about. He (Mr. Reece) mentioned those facts in his Mr. BURCRA said It ws quite clear that he was drunk th time, and he must pay 5s., the usul drunkards'
Prisoner (very excited).-I sha'n't pay 6s. I'm a magis. irate.
Mr. BunRCm -Whether you are a magistrate or not, Y'ou must pay the diue or go to prison for seven days.
Prisoner.-Theu, I'll go to prison for seven days.
While proceeding towards the vicinity of the cells he kltered his mind and paid the due, grumbling about fining
John Birman and Miehael CoDllns were brought up for further examination, charged with being concerned with Dthers in brealdng into a buteher's shop in Kent-street, and stealing 13 stoe oof beef, value 21. 8s., the Droperty of CharlesgHolland; and J*mes Evanswas charged with reeeiving tho same well knowing It to be stolen.

EFlITO?; V. Pr-ARSON.
This was an action for a breach of promise of marrinae to which the defendant had pleaded that the plaintsiffiiad before any breach of th caontpracateonerated and discharged him from the performance of it.
Mr.Maauly,Q. .,andMr W.H~Adams were counsel for the plaintiff; ° 'lldor,QCHand Mr. Flowers for the defendant.
This was not a romantic caso. The plaintiff is a young woman, 32 years of age, who had for several years lived as upper housemaid in the service of a Ur. Hyde, near Louth, and the defendant, whose age verged upon 60 had until recently been in business as a miller ana baker at Louth, and was possessed of asmall independent property. The courtship between them commenced about July, 1855, and continued in a not very smooth course down to June, 1856, when the engagemnent was broken off, After wedding dresses and a ring had been purchased and a settlement had been prepared. The termination of the affair at the last was rather sudden. The wedding day had been fixed for the 17th of June; the settlement had been arranged, by which the plaintiff was to have 7001. and a house or 121. a-ear during her life, if she survived the defendant, and the plaintiff's brother, who was to bo one of the trustees, was tocome over the 11th of June to executo it; but a day or two before the defendant's sister, by his desire, wrote a letter to the plaintiff, stating that the settlement would not be ready till the 13th, and requesting that the marriage should be put off until the 19th. On the 12th the defendant in. formed his sister that he did not intend to marry the plaintiff, and on the following day he made the same communicaton to the plaintiff herself, leaving her very abraptly as soon as he had told her so. On the 14th of June th% plaintiff went to the house of Mr. Salmon, a ioiner, who was to have been one of the trustees under the marrage settlement, and complained to him of the abrnpt manner I which the defendant had behaved. She had previously consulted Salmon on the subject of this marriage, and he had told her that he considered it objectionable on account of thefdisparity of years. Aftershohadinformedhim that the defendant n broken off the match the defendant came and saw the plintiff at his house, and Salmon thereupon "impiroved the occasion" by repeating his objection to marrages between persons whose ages were verv unequal, and expressng his hope that the separation wo.ld be for their mutual benefit. He thenm added that he thought everythng was arranged, except the amount of compensation, and he would leave them alone to settle that question. He accordingly retlred for abput 10 minutes, and upon his return the defendant informed him that they had agreed, but requested him to say what be thought would be a proper amount. Salmon then said that if the defendant had been alone to blame he should have said 50M, but, as the plaintiff was as much to blame as the defendant, he thought 301. The defendant then said that they had agreed upon 201., but he woulldmake it 2., which should be paid in Mr. Salmon's hands'for the plaintiff, who thereupon declared herself to be quite satisfied, and the two lovers then shook hands and parted on the most friendly terms, Mr. Salmon adding a further word of advice that neither of them should thereafter indulge in any recrimination against the other. The plaintiff's friends, however, appear not to have been equally satisfied with this arrangement, into which it was suggested that she had entered under a suppositoin that she could not obtain any legal redress; and shortly afterwards the de fendant was favoured with a lawver's letter; in reply to which he -wrote a very long vindication of his own conduct. He, first of all, epressed his surprise at receiving a lawyer's letter, as the maer had been settled between them; and then he proceeded to complain of her conduct, and referred espech.lly to her behaviour at the wedding of SusannaJarvis a fellow-servant, where she had gone, as she herself had said, "determined to have a spree," and where she had been seen sitting on the knee of a young man named Capes, and where "her treatment of him hulbeen a laughing stock." He professed that he had been in earnest in his esire to marry her, but complained that she had treated him with so much mdifference that compensation was due to him rather than to her; and expressed a belief that if she was determined to go to law, he should be able to lay before the jux? enough evidence to satisfy them that he had acted
&f. Salmon and several other witnesses were examined on behalf of the defendant; and from their statements it appeared that while the courtshi was sti going on the plaintiff had frequently declared that she did not think she could make up her mind to marry the old man, and that she had on one or two occasions said that she behaved at Jarviss wedding In the manner stated "in order to get shut of him.' One witness swore that he had told her that she ought to miake up her mind and that he would sooner die than marry a woman who behaved as she had dono. Another witness sated that after the match was broken off, she had said to him that Pearson had given her the "1sack," but that she should not cry about it, and that she and her sister laughed about It to him.
On the other hand, her mother stated that she was a good deal hurt at the abrupt mauner in which it had been termi. nated t and it was proved that she and her sister had giver up their places for some time in expectation of the wedding.
The learned JvrnZ expres,ed his own opinion that there ws no exoneration before breach of the contract,bu tleft that question, as well as the amount of damges, to the jury, w-ho found a verdict for the plaintiff-D amages, 1001.

The prosecutor is a publican at Great Ponton, five miles from Grantham. The prisoner is the son of a farmer at Stole Bochford. The prisoner, who had for some time shown sdins of eccentricity, was on the 22d of November last riding from Grantham with one Stephen Weston, of whom he had been asking some absurd queglons,
and on arriving at Great Ponton they each proceede to putup their horses. Weston soon afterwards found the prisoner in the stable, beating his own horse, and, after remonstrating with him, rode away. The prisoner then proeeeode
o lead his horse by the bridle into tho doorway of the house,

For the defence Mr. Bell set up the insanity of the prisoner, and called Mr. Christopher Turner, formerly Mr.Pforllnoolnshire, whodeposedtthattheprisoner,whowa son ofatenant of hs, had some time soapplied to him on the sbject of his relations' poisoning hls -food and water, alleging that he dared not even wsh his hands for fear of poison insinuating itself Into the cracks or scratches. Mr. W. Eaton, mayor of Grantham, had attended the prisoner professionally, and thought it unadvisable to let
im haye wine, for fear of his exeaeding, to which he was prone; but di not treat him as an insane patient. The pi lerk of Stoke Bochford also deposed to the prisoner having come to the church before service, and knelt at the door and prayed aloud, using incoherent and strange expresons. nSone of these witnesses appeared to have given any caution to the prisoner's friends. This was the ,principal evidence o[ the prisoner's stte of mind befoie the transacion.

3nown the prisoner for several years, and that he had seenI liimat Stockton a few days before the biU became due, and that the prisoner had said nothing to him on the subject.
Severa witnesae gave the prisoner a good character up to the time of his gomg to livo at Hull.
The jury returned a verdict of Guilty of uttering, with a recommendation to mercy.
He was sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
Thomas Joseph Robinson was indicted for forging an morder for the payment of money, with intent to defraud th"e Guardians of the Nor thBurley Poor-Law Union, in the 'West Riding of Yorkshire.
p r. Price promecuted; Mr. Campbell Foster defended the gnappeareo ad fromothevidence of the Rev. Mr. Fawdtt, the chaarman of the board of guardians, that the late Mr. Morris, solicitor, of Bradford, was the clerk of this non and that the prisoner was his articled clerk, and inM-r. Morris's absence he used to act as clerk to the Board. The custom was to draw checks on Messrs. Harris's bank at
3radftrd for any hills that became payable, to be filed up bydMr. Morris or his deputy, then for a memebr of the inance committee to put his initials to it, and it was then
presented to the chairman of the board of guardians for the
i bgnature of himself and two other members of the board. In every case the PaYment was made by check, a counterfoil of which was kept. The guardians had a pauper child being brought up intheDfea andD umb Instituation at Don. cmter, and a check won properly signed, initialed, and delivered over to the 'psone fo the purpose of being sent to
.poncaster. The tfo hich it was drawn was 61. 2s. 2d., but by some meane a figure of i had been placed before the 3, thus mhaking it into 16, and the word i teen" had been added to the wrtten number "six." In consequence of something that transpired the guardians examined the counterfoil, and found that it also had been altered, and on their obtaining the check from the hankers who had cashed it they discovered that the sum named in it had been ahlered to 16. The prisoner was sent for into the boardzoom, and of being asked, "How came this 1 before the 6, and the 'teen' after the 'six' in the bedy of the check ?" the prisoner admitted that he had altered the check and -placed them there before getting cash for, the check, and that he had got the 161. 2s. 2d., a part of which he hld sinco
us( for hiis own purposes."
It was elicited on cross-exatination of the Rev. Mr. :Fawcett, the chairman of the boaurd of guardians, that the

S. Wortley prosecuted; the prisoner was It appeared froba the opening statement of thelearned counsel, and the testimony of the witnesses, that on the night in question the prosecutor, who is a razor-grinder in 'Sheffield, was returning homae shortly after 11 o'clock, when lie was accosed by two men, one of whom was the pri-soner. Being afraid of garotters, the prosecutor feigned to be drunk. The prisoner then said to him aI reckon -thou's had a rare good bull week" (the name by which the -week before Christmas goes, when the workmen wvork night and day to earn as much as they can). The prosecutor said lie had worked very hard, but had not eaLrned as mauch monoyo as he could wish. The prisoner then put his arm -ro,u'ndhis neck and. said, "1Thou can hardily walk, old lad; -we will tak thee home." The prosecutor said he could take himself home, and to get rid of them said he lived a long way off in the country. After some more similar talk the prosecutor said if they would go with him along Orchardstreet he would pay for some of the best beer In Sheffield for them. On arriving at the archway of the passage where he lived he toldthem he had a friend lived up there, andwould fetch him, and they would have a glass together; and he then turned sharply up the passage, hoping to get away from them into his own house. The prisoner, however, immediately seized hold of him from behind threw his arm round his throat, tand, putting his knee in his back, said to the man with him, " Now, Joe, do thy work ; I have him." The other man directly felt at the prosecutor's pockets. The prosecutor struggledviolently, and at last got face to face to theprisoner andthrew him, both falling; and he then caUed for help to his wife as loud as he could, " Lucy, Lucy, help mue I" His wife shortly came runnimg out of his house and mized hold of the prisoner, who was stiU on the ground. As soon as the prosecutor saw his wife had hold of the man he said to herI " Stick to him, lass; he's been garotting me;" and she saia, " All right, I have him." (Laughter. The -ther man attempted to pull his wife away, and kept runnig and stop,_ing as if he did not know wshat to do. The prisoner, on rndin himself held fast by the prosecutor and his wife, said, "H Wave I robbed thee; hast thou lost anything ." Other persons then came up and the prisoner was
.anded over to the custody of the -ow and became very " okerd" and " obstropolous" going to the station. Lucy Styring, the prosecutor's wife, a good-looking, energetic yousgwoman,confirmedthisstatement. She said at the time in question she fancied she heard a faint voice caUing en her for help. It was so faint she did not know the voice, but she listened and then heard a cry of " Lucy, help me, help me." She ran down the yard and saw twoo men wrestling on the ground together, one of whom was her husband and the other the prisoner. She seized hold of the prisoner, who said, " Leave hold; what have I done?" and kicked her on the shins, while another man pulled her back by the hair. Her husband then told her " to stick to him, lass," and she kept tighter hold. Her husband had had a lhttle to drink, but was sober.
The prisoner said he was going home from his work, and had been drinking; the prosecutor invited him to drink with him, and they fell as they were going ;and denied all intention of robbing the prosecutor.
HiS LosDsEp having summed up, the jury retired, and en their return found the prisoner Guilty.
He was sentenced to be transported for 20 years, he having been twice before transported.

This steamship, which, it will be remembered, was tranded on the rocky shore off St. Alban's Head, on her return voyage from the Brazils, early on the morning of the 13th of January last, has at last been rescued from her state of bondage, and is now once xnore safely berthed in our docks. The attempts to float her have been renewed each successive spring tide, but all in vain till this morning, when a heavy westerly swell set in, and abolut a quarter-past 7 oldock, at the top of the tide, she was found to be afloat. All the necessary preparations having previously been made, the hull was immediately taken in tow by three powerful steamtugs, which started with her for Southampton. Telegraphic messages were forwarded here, announcing the fact, and subsequently that she had passed Burst, and the news was soon in general oirculation. The consequence was that whenx the vessels arived here, about 3 o'clock, there were xeveral hundreds of people congregated in the docks. The Tyne was towed up the river by three tugs, the Friend to all Nations (of London) a-head, and the Aid and Phcenix on either side, closely attached to the hulL As she came up the river the Austraiau Company's steamer Jura, just departing on her voyage out, passed her, and fired a couple of guns as a complimentary salute. The whole of the steanships in dock also hoisted their colours. A couple of small engines were engaged on deck in pumping the water out of the hull, which flowed out by the side of the I paddlewheel in a small cataract. She was towed direct into

The Wreck Of The Madrid.
I THE WgBCK OF THE SAlDBrD. I
SOUTHAMPTON, THURSDAY.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Sultan, Captain Neil Cook, arrived here this morning from Alexandria and G;braltar, with four passengers, among whom was Lieutenant Tickell, late Admiralty agent of the Madrid. Being an extra ship, she brings no mails. The Gialtar Chronicle of the 4th inst. gives the following particulars relative to the wreck of the company's steamer Madrid:-
" The Madrid, G. Bradshawv master, left Southampton on the 17th of Fer'ssy with the usual Peninsular mails, and experienced fine weather on crossing the Bay of Biscay. On the 20-h, at 4 a.m., sho made Villano light on port bow, and continned during the forenoon running along the coast at an offing of about six miles. On the same day, at 3'30 pm., while in the act of rounding Point Hombres, entering vigo Bay at full speed, she suddenly sud heavily strrok on asunken and invisiblerock, and remained fixed there. No confusion ensued. The quarter-boats were in tle water in about two minutes, and the women put into them, while Her !Majesty's mails were brought on deck. The order 'aTur astern' wrs given, and the vessel moved off the rock, gave a heavy lurch to port, recovered herself, was canted, and, as she was fast sinking, the order was given 'Turn a-head-fuU speed,' and the ship was run stem on to a sandy beach, in a small cove, conveniently situated. All this took place in ten minutes, by which time the forecastle deck wvas jr'st awash wiith the sea, and tha vessel surrounded by native fishing-boats, the crews of which layoff and behaved well.
" 13 minutes Her Majesty's mails, women, and treasure were in the ship's boats, and, acting in concert with the captain, after the catastrophe, the Admiralty agent, Lieutenant T. Tickell, R.N., left the packet, and in about two hours after reached the British consul's house in Vigo. At 10 p.m. Captain Bradshaw had lauded, and reported
that the vessel lay stiLM in the same position, but totaly immersed.
"No lives were lost. The first-class passengers saved everything, but the second-clas lost all their private property. The cargo, consisting of bale-goods, remained under water.
" The same night the Admiralty agent proceeded with a calvacade of horses and mnles, taking with him all the mails, and, travelling without cessation, reached Oporto on the 22d of February, at 6 p.m. The bar being cloeed, the Admiralty agent determined to proceed to Lisbon by land, and horses and mules were laid on, by consular assistance, for the differentstages. He took his departare on the 24th, at 2 p.m., and arrived at Coimbra at 6 p.m. on the 25th. Here he received most kind attention from Mr. Buxton, of the gasworks.
" On the 26th, at 9 a.m., he proceeded by diligence, and arrived at Lisbon at 8.15 on the morning of the 27th, and delivered the mails correct and tmdamaged."
On the arrival of Lieutenant Tickell at Lisbon the British screw steamer Thalia, Captain J. Wilson, from Glasgow, was immediately chartered, andshe left at 7 a m. on the 1st inst., with the mails for Cadiz and Gibraltar, arriving at the latter port on the 4th. The Madrid's passengers were left at Vigo by their own choice, to await the arrival of the next packet from Southampton.

) to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggesting that the p,esent seems a favourable opportunity for submitting to the Goverment of Her Majesty the expediency of publiasing the chronicles and other sources of English history anteror to the date of the Reformation, the Treasury having already sanctioned a scheme of the Master of the Rolls for the publication of a series of catalogues of materals for hstory from that penod downwards. He propo6es that these tzo undertakings, so recessary the one to the other, should proceed simultaneously, so as to present to the public, within a reasonable time, and at a moderate expense, a complete and uniform conspectus of the sources of our national history. In urging this guhjeet on the attention of the Government, Mr. Stevenson expresses hi opinion, based on a 20 years' crtical study of our early chronicles, that the sources of our nationalhistory are imperfectly known,-that many of them yet exist only in MSS. which are difficult of access, -that the texts of those printed are often based on imperfect and inaccurate copies, andthat no satisfactory history of England can be written tiLl the materials upon wvhich it must be founded shall have been collected, systematized, and published. A proposal was made in 1M4g tn t.k-
.uvun u i sor rne contlnuation of the series of our early historians by Mr. Hardy, of the Record-office in the Tower, the Rev. J. S. Brewer, of King's College, and Mr. Stevenson himself. The first two gentlemen being otherwise occupied, Mr. Stevenison asked that the contiuation of the work might be placed in his hands. This letter was referred by the Treasury for the opinion of the Master of the BolsE, wsho reported it to Sir C. Trevelyan, K.CB., on tne 26th of January last. Sir John Romilly considers-1, what materials shall be published; 2, how they shall be oubished; and 3, by whom and under whose authority or responsibility. As regards the first, he says that the object is or ought to be the publication of such historical materials as are not, or are only imperfectly, known to the public, including not only narratives of events, but works elucidating them and the causes of them-such, in fact, as the French. Monumena in6dits pour servir & 'Histoire. Sir John subjoins a list of such materials, which are very extensive and various. In the Eecond place he rejects the plan of publishing only such parts of chronicles or documents as relato to certain chronological periods into -which the history would be divided, and casting aside "irrelevant" matter. The objections to this course are numerous and insuperable. He prefers the publication of certain materials, selected by competent editors, without mutilation or abridgment. This, in fact, would carry into effect the (apparent) object of the House of Commons in an address prisented to the King in 1822. As regards the question by whom these works should be published, and under whose authority, the Master of the Bolls objects to the proposal of the Rev. Mr. Stevenson, to continue the plan of the Monumenta Historica Brifaaznicgi and beleves that it is expedient to allot distinct and separato portions of the work to separate and distinct editors, under tbe general direction of the Master of the Rolls, in a manner similar to that ado pted for the formation and publication of calendars of the State papers, and which has already obtained the sanction of the Lords of the Treasury. Each work would be selected by the 3iaster of the Rolls (on consultation), and the work, with the name of the gentleman to be employed as editor, submitted to the approval of the Treasury. Each editor would complete his task on his own responsibility and without superintendence. It is estimated that 3,0001 per annum, for 10 years, would enable the Master of the Rolls to complete the publication of the ;reater part of inedited matter worthy of publication. It is -arther suggested that a chronological catalogue of all the historical annals and pieces connected with English kistoty be prepared, containing all -the information neces&sary for determining the historical value of each piece. This proposal has been accepted by the Treasury, subject to a few modifications, and the Rev. Mr. Stevenson is referred by their rdsahips to the Master of the Rolls.

"1Bat there is one subject of paramnount interest at the present moment to which I must specialy refer.
"ISpeaking in July last, in the Hmouse of Commons, on the Appellate Jurisdisction Bill, I used these words-
"'I When the reutations of experienced tatesmen fel scattered around lke leaves in autumn, the noble Lordp (Palmerston) stood firm, nailed his colour to the mast, threw energy into the councils of-the Crown, saintained the honour of the country and restored aeae to Europe.'
"Those vere my con-victions then, t ey have been confirmed and strengthened by the events of lasutumn. . The whole of that strange history cannot now be told hut pos. terity wil recognize the maents of a Minister by w6ose per. severing couragfe alone all the conditions of peace were carriedaout, and thanls to whom Egland retainisher proudI and rightful place amnong the nations of theo earth.
"I believe that anu immense Masority of the citizens of London are determined to supportLM' =rstoern against combinations which I forbear to designate, hut which he has called, with happy magnanlinity, 'the fortuitous concourse of atoms in tho same lobby.'
"1Gentlemen,-At your bidding I have resigned a constituency as independent, intelligent, and faithful as any man ever represented. lbelieve thatlIshallbe honoured by your generous support, and I leave my eleztion in -your hands with perfect confidenice as to the result.

I come before you as a candidate on the broad principles of unfettered commerce, retrenchment, and reform, and in opposition to a party which in name alone representa the policy of a renowned Statasman. By a recent coalition of this patty with the Tory leaders the present Ministry has been placed in a minority in a divion on the warwith China, thereby prematurely bringing on an abruDt dissolntion. Will yo by the satction of your votes, belp to perpetuate this factious aud temporary coaiitlon between two politlcal sctions essentiaUy antagonistic to each other or wfll you return ss your members men pledged to supoort aMinister who is backed by the main strength of the Liberal party? Tho real question nowV at Imsue Is this-not whether Sir John 13owring shal be recaUed and his polcy repudiated, but whether in the new Parliament Lord Palmerston hall find him self agPin face to face with the old hostile msiority.

I have so often had the opportunilty of stating to you my opinions on public questions, and been honoured by your conSdence, that it is unnecesay for me to make may general declaratlon of my politiO principles It is little more than two yars ainoe,I was lst returned to Parliament; In that time we have ooncluded the war by an bonourable and satisfactory peso -A. treaty bas beon negotiated with the Minister of the United tatest, which Itrest may put n eLud to any cause of dilfference with that country, and which will, I hope, be ratified by Its Govern. onent; and a treaty has been concluded wita the Persian Plenlpotentlary, which Puts an end to the war with that country. The unwarrantable oonduct of the Chinese authorities at Canton, and their utter disegard of treaty obligatioas, have led to hostilities in China, In which the lives and property of British and other European residents have been endangered by the barbarous and atrocious measures of the Chinese. Itisa greatsatisfaction to us to havetheassurance that the measures taken by the British authorities there for the vindication of our rights have met the unanimous appros.l of all the Euopean and American commaunities on the spot; and that even those men whose profesion renders them most averse to measures of violenco have felt the necesity of tho3e stepL On this question Eer Maljesty's Government were placed in a minority by au extraordinary aombus,a tion of different parties I am not disposed to question the honesty and pmityof the motives by which many of those Totes were dictated but It was obvious from this and other circumstances that th. Government could not conduct with advantage the budnese of the country in the House of Commons It is now for the country in Ihe election of its future representatives to defd4e whether the preaen' Government shmal continue to admnisbter the affairs of this country oz whether their guldenoe is to be trausferred to other hands, chosen rom any of the very different parties who were united In the recent majority."

This trnstt, syou well 'now, is tbe hbhest bonour to which a oommercial man connected with the city of London can aspire, and there aro specialcremstanoee, at the pre3ent moment, which might seem to encder obedience to uch call a plain publin duty. But none of tbess considerationxwould have induced me to leave my tried and faithful riends, had the return of a second lhberal candidate for Northampton been jeopardized by my dolnu so.

DUBLIN, WEDNEsDAY.
a p to yesterday there had been a temporary calm in the market for new candidates, but the dulness is not likely to bo of long continuanee, and this morning's report show some symWtoms of reaction. After a lengthened retirment from
p ic life, the veteran Colonel Henry White, one of the lagest and wealthiest landed proprietorsn Ircland I about
otake he field for Longrord of -which county he is tho Lord-LtUutenant. As thgeiant Colonel's principles are Identical with thocg profee,el by the sitting membets, Coloe nel Greville and Mr. HL G. Hughes, the contest promises to be a severe one. Major Govin nas addressed the electors of the city of Limerick, and one of the local papers suggests that a coalition should be formed betwoeen the Msjor and Mr. Serjeant O'Brien, with a view of ousting Mr. Francis W. Russell one of the sitting m~ember6, wvhose conduct since le entered Parliament entitled him to better treatment at the hands of tho Roman Catholic party. In the oounty of Clare it is believed that Mr. Cornoliuns O'Brien is to retire, but that Sir John F. Fitzgerald, notwithstanding his pfat age? will again offer himself to the electors. Several new candidates are named, -viz., Mr. Luke White son of Colonel Henry Whito, aboyeo entioned - Mr. frs Creoh, l rd T. Conyngham and Mr. W. J. Siorrett-all iberas. Mr.Whiteprobably will provo the moet formidable of the batch. Yr. Franois Brodyan, of Piltown, Is about to resfgn the abrievalty of Drogheda, with aviewof contesting the borough with r I'Cnn, he present member. Sir William Somerrille is also spoken of, and it Is said that there is a strong feeling in his favour. A fourth candidate is reportedin the rson of C&,%n Singleton, who starts on the Conservative inte res f Martin Joseph Blake, who haI represented the town of Galway for upwards of 20 years, has, It seems, sinified his intention of retiring into ivte life.

Princess's Theatre.
PRINCNSJS THEATR2.
The grand event, expocted for some time, tho revivarof King Richard IZ., took place last night in tho presenOe oE ef a crowded audience, and astonished even those who ha
been accustomed to the magnifioenoe of Mr. Charles "easyrsstyle of productions. Before the eurtin rose the ge Irj impresgion was that Heinry VIII. and the Winwzs rar4 would not be surpassed, but long before the performanae had reached its termination the opinion was' murure& through the stalls that all past glories were eclipsed by tbe, lustreactuallypresent,andtbat*hardrrI. was, in fact, "the, best thing that Mr. Kean had ever done."
As the play did not terminate till midnight, when it huds ccupied four hours with solid uninterrupted magnUficence, we do not at present attempt to give a detailed account;. of its costly peculiarities. It is not too much to say that the faU of the curtain awakens the spectator out of such a gorgeous and vazied dream of the past ages that & fewv hours of sober reflection are absolutely necessary Wfore the massive whole can resolve itself into its constituent parts. Such an attempt to bring back before the public the Royal and aristocratic life of thebaronial timnes baa never been attempted on any stage; Of theatrical convention in the contrivance of the groupw and tableaux there is not a trace. Every scene, every ituation is newly conceived, and whenever an opportunity proaents itself a picture of medirad existence is conjured npon, the stage with a truthfulness of detail that no imagination. could realize. The " effect" that wiU be moat talked about;. is an episode which is introduccd between the third aud fourth acts, and represents the procession of the triumphant Bolingbroko and the deposed Richard, as describeui in the celebrated speech of the Duke of York to his Duchess. Processions have often been seen before, but a true living picture of a popular demonstration, execeted after the manner of this " episode" at the Princeses, isindeed a novelty. It seems a real mob-nay, a real popk._ that from road and window welcome Bolingaoke, and become sullenly silent or brutally insolent on 4he entrance of Richard, so that it is hard to look and listen without being carried away by the mimic enthusiasm on the stage, and becoming for the nonce a partisan of the elder or
younger branch of the Plantagenets. Bat this trlv mnar-- vellous picture is only one among a series, vieing with each other in elaborate magnificence. The lists on Gosford. Green, in which all the glitterin pedantries of chivalry are gone through with the nicest accuracy, convert the stge into the site of an actual trialby battle, with every appurtenance lving andsynboelic. The bedroom in Ely-house, with John of Gaunt on his deathbed, is a masterpiece of scenic solemnity. A real interiinable army teems to follow the standard of Molingbroke through the wilds of Glocestershire, and it is in! a genuine Westminster Hall, in the presence of spectators actually crowded in a spacious gallery, that poor King Richard formally abdicates, Never has there been so oon. stant an attempt to give reality to the illusions of the stage. Every setail has been stuldied wfith a view to historic truth, and every act and every artifce hasrbeen employed to make the spectaltor forget that he is In Oxford-street, and fancy that he isIn one orother ofthel olden edifices associated with the sad story of the second.
At an early opportunity we shall probably attempt some description of the magnifioent scenes which we have here briefly and incompletely enumerated. There are also histrionic details connected with this revival that are well worthy of something like analysis, for llr. Charles Wean was never seen to more advantage than when depicting the sorrows of the dethroned King - and Mrs. Charles Kean, who played the little more than nominal character of the Queen, made it a vehicle for her finest acting, by the mere foroe of her own genius A. success has been attained far greater than any amount op mere applause can express-that sort of success that at once stamps a production as a topic of the day, with which every.
one is hound to be familiar. Thunders of approbation o£, course, greeted the manager and Mrs. C. Eean as they. crossed the stage last night, but the more pernanent plau. dits wMi be uttered throughout this day in the *ttsmpts which will be made by all who were present at the Princesses Theatre to give their friends some faint notion of thc wonders they saw lastiniRht.
Screw Steaming To Australia.
SCREW bTTEIING TO AUSTRALIA.
The Melhourm2e Argwus contains the follovwing interesting lettor from the Rtev. J. L. LUlie, D.D., describing the trip of the screw steamship Royal Charter from Liverpool toe Melbourne:-
"The arriral of the Royal Charter, after her geecouff voyage from England, is an occurrence of such interest to the Australian colonies that a few observAtions from a passenger relative to tho incidents of the voyage may notf unacceptable to your readers.
" We steamed out of the Hersey against a westerly wintI on Thursday evening, the 2d of Otoer. We pat our pUot on board the bark Benin, bound for Liverpool, on the fore. noon of the 4th, about 20 mnies to the westward of Waterford. We had headwinds and calms tUI the 13th, when we passed the island of Madeira. We got the north-east trade on the 16th, in lat. 24.52 N., and lost it on the 19th, We crossed the equator on the 27th, in long. 26.38 W., after being 24 days out.
"During the whole of this first part of the voyage the winds wero either light or contrary, thus causing an unexpected demand on our steam power. Tho screw propeller was in action every day except three, and such was thea xtrength of the wind agamst winch wo had to contend the second day after starting that we only made 108 miles inr the 24 hours.
" The importance of the screw as regards the health of the passengers wan very apparent when pafing through the calns to the north of tho equator, with upwards of 600 people crowded, as they must necessarily be, within the lmits of a single vessel, carrying a large cargo besides. We
shoald have been in great danger of epidemic disense had. wo been detained long in those hot and unhealthy latitudes - as it was, onl slight symptoms of illness had time to manifest themselves among the children, of whom thero were up. wards of 60 on board. Two, of very delicate constitution, died dnring the hot weather, and one, at a later period, of disease caught at the same time. The three were all very young, We had an excellent run from the Equator to the
ead, and only required to steam on four separato days.
"On the 18th of November we sailed 325 geographical miles, allowing 29 minutes for the difference of longitude; this gives 3S3 statute miles in the 24 hours, or at the rate of 16 miles an hour. In three consecutive days, including the 1th of November, we ran, making the same allowance for difference of longitude, 957 nautical miles, which gives about 132 knots an hour, or 1,108 statute miles, with a average velocity of 15.4 miles an hour.
"Our greatest run was on the 3d of December, which, after allowing ei ht miles from 8.12 difference of longitude, gave 360 nautical miles in the 24 hours, or exactly l knots an hour; changing it into statute miles we have o lessm than 417 as the result of this day's sailing-A speed of nearly 173 miles an hour. At one time upwards of 17 knots rn off tho reel showing a velocity of 20 nmies an hour, the ship all tho Whive carrying royals and studding sails, the summer season too, when the winds are from latitude 23.30 south, longitude 37.6 toCapoOtway. The distance by the roetewe ollowed is 8,964 nautica miles; this we accomplished in 34 days, and in light winds. This exceeds the celebrated run of the Lightning in the corresponding part of her voyage in the winter of last year, when she completed. 8,146 miles in 33 days, or an average of 247 miles per day, or 10 k-nots an hour weheress the Royal Charter's averag was 264.J nautical miles a-day, or 11 knots an hour.
"A remarkablo phenomenon presented itself whent running between the parallels of 43.31 and 45.3 south latitude, and 40.27 and 5 .32 east longitude. For three days and over a space of 700 miles, the sea was quite changed,
and had the dull, turbid apparance which is so well known., to mariners when in soundings. Some parts were more. affected in this way than others, but the whole was manifestly differeut from the ordinary colour of the ocean
" Captain Boyce informs me that he observed the same. change last voyage, but only for 150 miles, and when his course lay about 139 miles further south, and that, though he has repeatedly sailed over the same ground, he never saw or heard of it before. Had circumstances admitted of it it would have been highly interesting to ascertain whether we really were in soundings, a subject of inquiry peculiarly deserving the attention of future navigators, an connected with the geological question of a possible rise of the subjacent land. The same arrangemert with referenceto the compasses was adopted in this as in the preceding voyage, and with the same highlv satisfactorv results. The. compass, fixed by copper fasteninigs at an elevation of 4'
feet to the mizenmast, was found to act with the utmnost; accuracy, and altogether free from the disturbing action o4 the iron of the ship.
"As a practical proof of this, as well as of the excellence.. of our chronometers and the regularity and precision with, which the observations were tarken, I may mention that the frst land we distinctly saw was a rock called Goughba Island, ring preipitously in the midst of the South. Atlantic to the height of 4,000 feet in 40.19 south, 9.41 west. We sighted this at the very hour that had been. predicted to myself the day before by the captain, and la6fi night, when the loom of the Australian land began to appear, and, above all, when the beautiful light on Capem Otway first disclosed itself, at the very time we bad been led to expect it, a thrill of emotion passed through all on board, caused not more by the thougt of havMn it lGURtI
got within sight of our destination than by a tion fot the triumph of scienee and art winch had so strikinglysig. silized itself by our arrival at the given hour and p
afteravoyageof 13.000 miles thron h the trackdess ocean.
',The feeling of distrust which, for a considerable time- - and with too much reason, attached Itself to iron ahips on account of the irregularity and uncertainty in the action of their compasses has now disappeared-a circumstance o£' no small moment, when iron is so rapidly displacing wooy in the naval arsenals of Eurode.
" The great drawback in tho present voyage as compared with the previous one has been the unfavourable weatherwe expenenced as far as the line. We lost six days on thi'. part of the voyage. Our average speed, chiefly with seam, was rather under seven knots.
"e From the line to Australia, on the other hand, this. voyage bears a decidedly Advantageous comparin with the-
last. Inthe last themrun was made in41days inethislo t hasibeen done in 40 days, 'with the Iiyrtant difrerence that we lost severatl days b beinthrown by adve wins o
towards the coast o SoutA ica, and o a d therefore a. course fully 1,000 miles;longer to describe..
"The combination iof raoderate steam wer with firstclass sAilingqualities is undoubtedly i the slution of the problem of the AustralianT ye s as alone disejiesing with the necessity of caillin at =nMediateIpots, AN 3a the same time providing effec6tually against the Inevit-ablo, ecntingencies of calmns and unfavourablAe.wnds.
