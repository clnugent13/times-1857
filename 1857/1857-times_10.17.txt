IND I A. MThs following appered In our second editon of yes, terdzy:-] The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent. It gives an admirable summary of events sinoe last mail- "3OMBAY, SBrr. 17. " I am happy to be able to begin this letter in a spirit more hopeful than that in which I closed my last. I think the violence of the hurricane is spent. It is getting lighter to windward, and ever and again one catches glimpses of the blue as the scud drives overhead; not that our chief anxieties have ceaged to oppress us, for we do not yet know that Delhi is taken, or that! Lucknow is relieved; but we entertain a feeling of confident asrurance in the one case, and in the other of, as we believe, well-grounded hope that within a few days previous to this on which I am writing each of these earnestly-desired ends has been attained. The exciting festival of the Mohurrum has paswed over without turbulence, not merely in Calcutta and in Bombay, but also in Madras, 'with its ill-affected Mussulman suburb of Triplicane, and in Hyderabad with its Mogul traditions, its fierce, unscrupulous nobles, and its Arab soldiery. Throughout the army of this presidency no further outbreak has taken place, and, though I think we may still have losser in regiments particularly exposed to temptation by their position on the frontier, any general disaffection will, I trust and believe, be prevented by the exhibition of English troops, 'Which we are now, or shall immediately be, able to make in quarters where the temper of the Sepoys or of the people may appear unsatisfactory. " My last letter brought down the history of the force before Delhi to the 12th of August, on the morning of which day Brigadier Showers surprised and captured with the bayonet a battery of the enemy between Metcalfe-house and the Cashmeregate of the city. It was a very gaUant affair, but our loss was not inconsiderable, amounting, as I learn, to 113 killed and wounded,-many of the latter, however, very slightly. The troops engaged were the 75th, 1st Fusileers, and Coke's Rifles (1st Punjab Infantry), supported by a squadron of the 9th Lancers, some Punjab cavalry, and seven field pieces. The enemy's four guns, which had belonged to one of the three field batteries of which the gunners mutinied, were brought into camp by the infantry. The Brigadier himself was wounded, as was Major Coke-the latter through the leg. By 7 o'clockl the troops, with their trophies, were back in camp. During the rest of the day and throughout the 13th nothing particular occurred. On the 14th Brigadier Nicholson's column-lately, you will recollect, the ' flying column' of the Punjab, which destroyed the Sealkote mutineers, and rendered other good services-joined its chief, who had preceded it in the camp. Thus were added to the army the 52d Light Infantry, nea2ly 700 strong, the left and remaining wing of the 61st, Captain Bourchier's field battery-in all upwards of 1,100 Europeans, and about 1,400 Sikhs. Of the latter were the 2d Punjab Infantry, 800 strong, regarding whom an officer of experience who saw them march in writes in terms of high admiration. With them were a body of Miooltanee horse, a'.o very good. The infantry of the army was now formaed into four brigades ; the first, under Brigadier Showers, iis formed of the 75th, 2d Fusileers, and the Kemaoon Battalion; the second, commanded by Colonel Longfield, of the 8th, comprises the 52d Light Infantry, the 60th Rifles (six companies), and the Sirmoor Battalion; in the 3d, under Colonel Jones, of the 61st, are five companies of the 8th, the 61st, and Rothney's Sikhs. Nicholson commands the 4th, and has under him the lt Fusileers and the 1st and 2d Punjab Infantry (Coke's Rifles and Green's). The Guides are not brigaded.. Colonel Grant, of the 9th, commands the cavalry, and Brigadier Garbett the artillery. The latter arm had been strengthened by Nicholson, not only with the field battery, but alo with three 18-pounders and two 24-pounders, together with ammunition and stores. In all, the camp now showed about 9,700 fighting men, of whom 4,600 were English. So, at least, I find it stated, and the tale agrees pretty nearly with my own calculations and information. For many days now the enemy attempted nothing further than a few shots at our piclkets, and if once or twice they appeared in force outside the walls with an intention to attack the intention was speedily abandoned, and they disappeared again within the city. Never, indeed, more clearly than of late has it been demonstrated that the rebellion has brought forward no native of even average military ability-that the mutinous army has no leader worthy of the name. No Sivajee, no Hyder, no Cheetoo even, has appeared in its ranks. Often, like an undisciplined mob, at best merely an agglomeration of regiments, the rebels have attacked us again and again, and fiercely enough at times, when well under cover, but always with a poverty of conception and want of plan that betrayed the absence of a master mind. And now that they know strong reinforcements have joined our army, and that the day of retribution is not far distant, although they make, as we shall see presently, an r.ttempt to intercept the siege train which they know will work their destruction, still by these vacillating and abortive gatherings outside the walls, and by the dissensions and desertions that are rife within, we are assured, we learn, that the huge body of the insurrection is still without a vigorous and lifegiving spirit. One party from the city did indeed in these days proceed towards or to Rhotuk, on the road to Hansi, probably to join the rebels In that district, but they were followed by Lieutenant Hodson, commanding a body of Sikh horse, brought to action, and broken up with considerable loss. On the 21st there was a momentary display of vigour on the part of the enemy in the erection of a battery on the left or further bank of the Jumna, to annoy the left of our camp and the picket at Metcalfe-house. But, as we hear nothing more of this new battery, I conclude that the great distance has rendered it either silent or innoxious. On the 25th took place the movement to intercept the siego train to which I have alluded. Such, at least, is supposed to have been the object of the proceeding, though the line of march of the mutineers was to the westward of Delhi, in the direction of Nujuffghur, for from that point a flank march north- eastward to Soneeput wouldbringthem uponthe high road by which the traina was advancing, and well in our rear. Their force was considerable, and is said to have included the men of Bix revolted regiments of infantry and of three of irregular eavairy, with 13 guns. Other accounts say it was mainly composed of the old Neemuch Brigade and Kotah Contingent. Divining the intention with which this formidable body had left the city, General Wilson rsent a brigade under Nicholson is purauit of them. The Brigadier made all the hasae he could to, overtake the enemy, but such wras the difficulty of getting his guns through tha swampy and flooded country that it was 4 o'cloak in tho afternoon before he came up with them, posted at the villDage of Nujuffghur. He at o;aerattacked them, and with complete succems, captewing all their guns-of which nine were English lkRd-piece, the other four native, the palace guns o£ former days-their camp equipage and stores, killirg and woundingbetween 300 and 400, and driving back the rest broken and dispirited to Delhi. His own loss is variously stated, but is nowhere carried higher than 60, including casualties of all 4inds. Lieutenant Lumaden, of Coke's '{ifles, wea killed, and Lieutenant Gabbett, of the Gist, vaQ,t-y 'oujdtA, On the morning oa the fo%19.T ing day, the 26th, the mutineers in the city, knowing that Nicholaon had not yet returned from the scene of his victory over their comrades, and fancymg, as is supposed, that his absence materially Weakened our strength, made an attack on our line of posts, the first for more than three weeks. The* fighting lasted in a dersultory m3anner throughout 1 the day, with a cost to us of 8 killed and about twice as many wounded. The enemy suffered severely, both in horse and foot, by the fire of grape from our centre battery. For several dayrs after this action,indeed, up to the evening of the 30th, our latest date,-the enemy remained quiet, and our force was occupied in clearing ground to our right front, preparatory to the arrival of the heavy artillery. On the night of the 29th a breastWork of the enemy which interfered with these movements,lying between our advanoed pickets on the right and the walls, was carried at the point of the bayonet. That done, a trench was carried from the advanced post to "a ravine forming a natural parallel." Our information is scanty here, but it is clear that the engineer officers were availing themselves to the utmost of the natural features of the ground, so as to make up as far as possible for the absence of regular approaches against the place. Batteries, too, are being erected for the heavy guns about 900 yards from the Morse Bastion, and aU in camp. were in high spirits at the prospect of offensive operations. Meanwhile In the city, if the stories 'we hear are correct, all was doubt, irresolution, and dismay. Dissensions and recriminations between the unsuccersful. Ieader% and constant desertions among their cowed followers-such are the conditions under which the rebel army was about to meet the final assault. That assault would, in all probability, take place between the 7th and the 15th of this month. Many letters from the camp speak sanguinely of a date a, early as the former of these days, but none postpone it beyond the latter. At one time it appeared likely that General Wilson, even rhen strengthened by the arrival of the heavy guns, would wait for reinforcements from Havelock in the south. But, as we hoped and anticipated, he soon learnt that that spirited leader had far too much work on his hands to admit of his advancing to the north-west, and he prepared, therefore, to play out the game with his own resources alone. Let him but get his siege guns and mortars into position, he wrould crush down the enemy's fire by a storm of shot and shell, and then, whether by breaching orbyescalade, he would deliver the assault. Now, the siege train would be in camp by the 2d or 3d instant. It consisted of 32 pieces, I am told, 24-pounder guns and 10-inoh mortars and howitzers It was; being escorted by the Belooch Battalion of the Bombay army sent up from Scinde, and I believe by the remaining three companies of the Sth Foot, with convalescents of the 52d and 60th, who were halted at Kurnaul to await its arrivaL About the same time would come in the 4th Punjab Infantry, with 200 Pathan horse, the detachment of the 24th Foot and Horse Artillery from Peshawur, and two companies of the 60th Rifles from Meerut, relieved by Sikh Irregulars. Thus the strength of the army would fully reach 11,000 men, which, as I mentioned In my last, was Sir John Lawrence's estimate for the beginning of September. On the whole, then, I caunot doubt that my next letter will convey to you the news that Delhi is at last in our possession. If the enemy malke any stand at all, we rmust expect that our lo, will be very considerable; but the slaughter of the mutineers will be terrific, for, as may be supposed, the troops are in a high state of exasperation, and it will be found no easy matter to control them when they are let loose upon this vast and populous city. In the immediate neighbourhood of the capital of the revolt things were looking favourable enough. The Meerut district was tranquil, and the road to Delhi as free and open as it was before the 10th of May. The Hurrianah district, with its principal towns of Hansi, Hissar, and Sirsa, was stil held by Van Cortlandt's force, which was steadily engaged in pacifying it. The number of the petty chiefs of that part of the country had been thinned by death in the field or upon the gallows. Thus the uncle of the reigning Newab of Bhutteeana, who, having been engaged to protect Sirsa, had plundered the town and proclaimed the King of Delbi, was taken, tried, and executed by the GeneraL The Newab himself, equally faithless, w-as seized while endeavouring to escape out of the district, and was about to be put on his trial, to meet, no doubt, the same fate as his relative. There still, however, remained many restless and mutinous spirits. There had even been an attack upon Hissar on the 19th of August, where Captain Mildmay was stationed with Irregulars of Van Cortlandt's force, the General himself being at Hansi The assailants were some few thousands strong, but the besieged sallied forth and drove them away in utter confusion, cutting up some 250 of them. Lieutenant Boileau, of a late Bengal regiment, attached to the Irregulars, received a very severe sword cut in the face while leading a charge of cavalry, but when last heard of was doing well. This was almost the only casualty. The few prisoners taken were shot or hung on the following days. In Agra, at our latest dates, all was well. Closely packed as our countrymen and countrywomen must be in the fort, they appear to be in excellent heart, and to be finding amusement for themselves, under difficulties, with a spirit not unworthy of their country. Such, indeed, was at one time the exuberance of their mirth that it was found necessary to promulgate a general order condemnatory of singing and playing of flutes and cornopeans-an order the carrying out of which is not unhappily conceived in a couple of stanzas printed in the Mofissilite (now published within the fort), which I could give you but that my business lies with graver matters-lies, for instance, with the fight between Hattrass and Allyghur, on the 24th August, when-musical and martial lik-e Volker, of the Niebelungen Lied-a detachment of regulars and voluateers from the Fort of Agra, under Major Montgomery, encountered a strong body of the insurgents of the Doab posted in a large enclosed garden, known by the name of one Maun Singh. The skirmish was short, but decisive, and the enemy were driven back to Allyghur,which, it is said, they proceeded to evacuate, with the loss of 200 or upwards of their number. Montgomery fell back to Hattrass, satisfied with his success, and wisely declining to make a further advance with his little force. His loss was slight-five killed, including Ensign Marsh, of the late 16th Grenadiers, and Mr. Tandy, indigo planter and volunteer. His opponents for the most part were fanaticA. Mu3ssunans from Allyghur and the district, but a body of cavalry engaged is supposed to have been once in our service. "Turning back to the Punjab, I find that three or four more mutinies have taken place among the disarmed Bengal regiments. You will not have for- gotten what I wrote in my last of the rising of the 26th at Lahore, and their alrnost instantaneous anInihilation. Since then, on the 14th of August, the Soubahdar-Major of the regiment,oneof its Jemadars, two Havildars, and eight Sepoys, were executed, completing the tale of destruction. Butin another and later instance retribution has been even more swift, though not more deadly. On the 28th of August the dissrmed 51st broke out at Peshallur. On the following day General Cotton reported to Laboro that out of 871 men 785 were ' accounted, for,' and that the re3mainder were bein(g brought in by twos and t!Lrees by the villagers and the police. At T Woallah portions of the 5th and 60th broke away, Dnot were pursued, and 130 of them slain, At 'orQzepore, of the 10th LighIt (fvolTy, wbic for so long a period did good service against the 't,t; neors, and when disarmed as a precautionary measure offered no oppoeition whatever, 100 mutinied on the 19th of August. They murdered MIr. Nelson, their veterinary surgeon, attempted' to possess theinselveg of the guns of Captain Woodcock's battery, seriously wounding a gunner, and had captured and made off with many of the horses before they could be interfered with. But the fe* fhen ef the 61st. Deft at, the station and the Bombay Fuoileers attacked them with navige, energy, and their treason was bloodily expiated Thirteen of those who got away were taken at Loodiana, and hanged, on the 28th. At Hazar L we learn that on the 7th of AtAgtf 41 of the Ath, including seven commieioned and as many no(ncommissioned offlicers, were executed, and that43 more had arrived, brought in by Gholab, Singh's poople in Cashrmere. Thus, by the inAtrn mentality of his various lieutenints, and throughon the length and breadth of hig province, is felt the iron hand of the Chief Commissioner. SirJohn hag been of late chiefly at Lahore, but on the 24tht of August he reviewad at Juliundlu the cetingent of Sikhs furnished by Gholab Singh's suceessor, Rungbeer Singh. They Were about 2,500 strosg, chiefly infantry, with a troop of horse artiMlery and 24 zumnbooruks, or light swivel guns, all excellently dreesed md equipped. Sir John after the review callea the 3flicers to the front, and addressed to them a manlymd sensible speech expressive of his satisfaction, mnd promising regular pay and pensions for 'he wounded and the families of the killed. But now, leaving these districts, where British supremacy is rapidly regaining the ascendant, *edrop down the Ganges to Cawnpore, and approach the point of our greatest present interest and anxiety-Lucknow, with its imprisoned garrison, and women and children. I have already said that we entertained a hope, which we believed to be wll grounded, that the capital of Oude would be reached and be relieved by Havelock. Since writing t0 that Iffect this morning I have seen the latest letter reseived in Bombay from Sir James Outran. It is lated theist and 2d inst., being finished at Allahabad on the latter day, and there posted In the confident opinion both of Sir James and of General Ha'velock, with whom at Cawnpore Sir James was in constant comrmunication by the river, Lucknow would be able to hold out till relieved. Writing on the 31st of August, General Eavelock reports that his latest accounts represent the beleaguered party as safe and in good spirits. The stotiea that had been circulated regarding their distress,and their applying for terms! (the italics and the note of admiration are the indignant Sir James's own), were to be regarded as inventions of the enemy. (I should mention that we heard from native runners, who had reached Benares, that the inmates of the besieged fort had been placed on halfrations about the middle of August, and could hold out therein for about a month longer.) There would be opposition to the march of the relieving army, wrote Havelock, but all would be well ' if we take lots of heavy guns with us.' Now Outram, as I have said, got to Allahabad on the 2d. He would have probably been there sooner, but delay seems to bave occurred somewhere-perhaps from the necessity under which he lay of visiting each of the river stations of the Dinapore division, endangered by General Lloyd's culpable mismanagement-but partly also, I believe, from the fact of an advance upon Lucknow by the River Gogra and Fyzabad being at one time contemplated by him, though afterwards abandoned as impracticable. However, on the 9th he expected to reach Cawnpore. He had with him about 1,500 Europeans, consisting of the 5th Fusileers and the 90th, and a strong company of Royal Artillery. This reinforcement would raise Havelock's force to at least 2,000 Europeans. Of guns, light and heavy, there was an abundance; of cavalry, unfortunately, only about 40 men, and the volunteers from the infantry. HTavelock had made, or was making, full preparations for crossing the Ganges directly he was reinforced, and for carrying the intrenchment which the enemywereobserved to have thrownup onthe further bank. I must not omit to mention that Outram had sent word to Havelock that he should accompany him in his civil capacity only (you will remember he was Chief Commissioner of Oude when sent to command the army in Persia, and that the lamented Sir Henry Lawrence was acting for him). Not for an instant could he think of depriving his brother in arms of the glory of relieving the garrison, and of completing the work which he had so nobly begun. "But, while waiting for Sir James, General Havelock was not idle, nor alloved the ardour of his men to cool, or the terror inspired by his name to subside. ifter his final action in the Oude country, on the 12th of August, he recrossed the river the same day, as I wrote in my last. On the 16th, having heard that the mutineers had gathered in strength at Bithoor, where he had once already beaten them, the General took his little band from Cawnpore and marched straight upon them. They were estimated at more than 3,000 strong, with two. guns, outnumbering Havelock's men in, I suppose, the proportion of five to one; yet, as usual, they were utterly and disgracefully beaten. Their position was carried and their two guns were captured. The men were too weak in numbers and too much. exhausted by the fight, and a march of 12 miles in thef. terrible heatof the sun,to followtheenemy far, sothey bivouacked for the night to the south of Bithoor, and returned to Cawnpore the next day, having lost.. between 40 and 60 killed and wounded. The los., of the enemy w, s moderately estimated at 250 sdain Of the appalling massacre at Cawnpore we haver received further and fuller accounts in the statsments of Lieutenant Delafosse, of the 63d, one of the two officers who escaped by swimaming from t2h boat that was brought on shore and captured afte r the others had been sunk; of an ayah in the empl Sy of a bMrs. Greenway, one of the sufferers; and of Myoor Towaree, a faithful Sepoy of the 1st Nas ive Infantry, who suffered for his fidelity by impri s0nment. According to the account given by the 1 ttter. General Wheeler was not dead when the party surrendered to Nena Sahib, but was alive, 'though wounded, and was in the boat which was ci ptured The party thus taken consisted, he say s, of 50 sahibs, 23 mnem-sahib*, and four children.1' Tle sahibs were all shot by order of the Nena.' The poor women threw their arms around their hus bands and,' begged to be allowed to die with thern, but th a Sepoys, by the Nena's command, dragged thein away. The chaplain asked for tinme to read a pray e aloud, and the request was granted. Then the w or) was given, and the two comnpanies of Sepoys dr a,n up for the purpose fired. ' One Sahib roiee, one way and one another, btut they were not del d, only wounded; so they went in and finished th em with swords.' The women and children, toget aer with a number more, who had either been ta' ,en out of this party or other boats, or who had never been permitted to embark with the men, w are then, to the nuumber in al of 122, imprisoned in what had been the civil hospital, when the de ponent hinMelf, theu in custody, by order of the Nena, as (what he really was) a spy and friend of the English, had the opp ortunity of seeing and speaking to them. Of the fate that befell them when the mniscr" ,ant saw himself forced to abandon Cawnpore t j his victorious enemy, Havelock, he merely tol'4s us what we knew beforethat all were ruthlesl slaughtered; but in answer to the question, 'V'e ore the women dishonoured l he replieo in thG uegative, with the exception' of one yo ang la-iy whom he distinctly specifiei, and ot |whom both he and the ayah assert that previrjw to Iher de-A!,! o1iQ royenged herte]f by destro: - '4

IRIBLAND. I (FROM OUR OWN1 VORR Pwpnv- N DUBLIN, THURSDAY MOaznL.G REPRESENTATION Op WVICERLOW The Hon. Mr. Proby's address to the constituency has been published. It is brief, as such documents generally are, but tolerably explicit. Mr. Proby promises to give an independent support to the Government of Lord Palmerston, and upon the great topic of the day he observes:- " At the present crisis I should be anxious to strengthen the hands of the Executive to enable it to crush the foul rebellion which is now desolating a great portion of our Indian empire. While I am strongly attached to the insti. tut{ons of the country, I shall be ready to consider such modifications and improvements as the lapse of time and course of events may prove to be desirable, ever having in view the object of extending their scope while strengthening their foundations. To maintain abroad the honour and integrity of the British empire, and at home the utmost degree of freedom consistent with security to person and property, ought to be the end proposed by every measure of every Government. To those measures only that, after mature consideration, I deem calculated to forward these ends I should give my assent." As regards questions of local interest the hon. gentleman is all but silent. INAUGURATION OF THE MOORE TESTTMONrLM. The inauguration of the statue of the Irish bard was celebrated yesterday by the friend of Moore, the Earl of Charlemont, in the presence of the LordLieutenant, Lord Talbot de Malahide, Lord William Fitzgerald, Lord George Hill, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Justice of Appeal, Baron Greeno, Sir Philip Cramnpton, Sir Edward M'Donnel, Sir W. R. Hamilton, the RTigh Sheriff, Sir Bernard Burke, and a host of Irishmen famous in the literary, scointific, and mercantile world. EBrected on one of the most eligible sites in the metropolis, under the shadow of the gray walls of our poet's Alma Mater, and in front of Ireland's ancientHouse of Legislation, the statue of Thomas Moore is so placed that it commands the attention of every visitor to the city. At 1 o'clock precisely the Lord-Lieutenant arrived, attended by his private secretary and the aides-decamp on duty, and was at once ushered within the space enclosed aro-und the base of the pedestal. Imnmecliately hlis Excellency had taken his seat on the chair of State prepared for his accommodation the Earl of Charlemont was conducted to the President's seat, which was placed between the sedilia intended for the Lord-Lieutenant and the Lord Mayor, who, on the part of the municipality of Dublin, attended with the corporation and the civic officers to receive the testimonial from the hands of the committee. The assembly being seated, Lord Charlemont rose amid tremendous cheering, and proceeded to inaugurate the statue in a speech of some length, in the course of which he reviewed Moore's claims to the veneration and honour of Irishmen. At the conclusion of his address he directed the statue to be unveiled, and then declared it duly inaugurated. The Lord-Lieutenant next delivered an eloquent speech on the subject of the day, and was enthusiastically cheered. In the name of the Testimonial Committee, Mr. Thomas O'Hagan, Q.C., then came forward and presented the memorial to the citizens of Dublin, and took occasion to pronounce a eulogistic discourse on the merits of the national bard. The presentation was accepted by the Lord Mayor in the name of the city, and, a vote of thanks having been passed to Lord CYharlemont, at the instance of the Lord-Lieutenant, seconded by Lord Talbot de Malahide, the proceedings terminated. THE BELFAST TEA FRAUDS. Accounts from Belfast, dated yesterday evening, supply the following proceedings in connexion with the recent frauds on the Customs. The two prisoners, Messrs. Henley and Harbison, have, it will be seen, been committed for trial, Henley, however, being admitted to bail, but Harbison still remaining in custody .- " Few matters connected with the commerce of this town have excited more widespread interest than the recent tea frauds of John James Moore. Coning as it does close on the heels of the commiasion of inquiry into the Belfast street riots of Jvly and September, which liave done so much to lower the reputation of the town, it is felt as doubly to be regretted. There is nothing that the merchants and manufacturers of the town are so sensitive about as their commercial probity, and anything that even slightly trenches upon their high character for rectitude in their dealings gives them espeolal pain; but it should be remembered that Moore, the principa delinquent in these tea frauds, was only for three or four years connected with Belfast. Hetravelledsome years ago for some of the most eminent houses in the tea trade in Liverpool, London, and Glasgow, and, attracted by the prosperity of Belfast, he settled down here, became a junior partner in the house of M'Donnell and Co., and on tho retiring of the senior member of the firm, about 18 months ago, he was left in sole possession of the business. No irregularity was suspected to have taken place in the bonded store in oonnexion with his premises till the 1st of October, when a search was instituted, and it was then discovered that no fewer than 786 chests were what are technicaUy caUed 'dummics,' that Is, the chests containing the teas had been taken away and others had been sub. stituted, the contents of which were brlckbats, turf, straw. and sawdust, while the exterior coverings were branded witls the Custom-house marks, and made in every respect similar to the real chests. The duty on the missing chests is 4,4001. Moore- disappeared from town on the evening of the search, and, notwithstanding the exertions of the police, he has not since been heard of. Two other persons were arrested, one a young man named Henley, who filled a situiation as clerk In a respectable manufacturing firm in 'own, and the other a man named Harbison, who was employed till within three months ago by Moore. The charge against both these Is 'for aiding and assisting in illegally removing goods from a bonded warehouse to evade th, Customs' duties, contrary to the provisions of the Customs Coneolidation Act of 1853." There have been several private investigations, and to-day the first public examination was held in the Town-hal. A very large number of the merchants and business people of the town attended in the Council-chamber to hear the proceedings." There were but two witnesses examined-Mr. W. W. Godfrey, landing surveyor of the port, and John Rvobb, a porter in the employment of Moore-but their evidence elicited no new facts. The case for the prosecution having closed, t" Mr. Gardner applied for the committal of the parties to the assizes for aiding and assisting in the illegal removal of chests of tea, In evasion of the duty, contrary to the Customs' Consolidation Act. "Mr. Hunt said they were, strictly speaking, only charged with mlsdemeanour, and he would take the statements of the prisoners' examination. " Mr. M'Lean said he had instructed them to reserve the defence till the trial. " The prisoners were then apprised in the usual way that they might make any statement they thought proper, but botn declined stating that they reserved their defence for their trial. They were then committed for trial at tho spring assizes, and a rule of ball was fixed of each prisoner in 5001., and two sureties of 2501. each. " Mr. M'Loan applied for a reduction of the ball in Harbison's case. b' "Mr. Gardner said the amount already fixed shouldl not ho reduced. '^ Mr. Hunt then declined to lower it. "The two gentlemen who had formerly bailed Henley then renewed their recognizances, and he was set at liberty, and up to the time of forwarding this despatch bail had not been taken for Harbison. "The case continues to provoae the keenest discussion In town, and every one asks the other the ominous questions, which have hitherto rceived no solution,-' What has become of the 786 chests of tea 9'"Who purchased them 9' and ' What price was paid for them 9" THE FUNDS.

The Banner of Ulster has the following statement with respect to the potato crop in the north of Ireland. From other quarters of the kingdcm the accounts are by no means so unpromising, but it would be idle to deny that the old fatal blight has made greater ravages even in the south and west than most people were prepared to admit before the crop had reached to full maturity :- " We regret to find that, as the real quality of the ' keeping' crop of this year comes to proof on digging out, in this district, the proportion of unsound tubers is even larger than had been feared; and, -what is still more disheartening, that the ratio Is further increased on storing, especially in pits- the most common practice. Prices, therefore, of potatoes fit for table use may be expected to go upwards as the season advances, not only from this cause, tut on account of the large ex;port certain to be required to make up the deficiency in Scotland, in the east of which country-the most fertile and best cultivated portion -the disease has destroyed, in an incrediblyshrtiete hulk of the crop in some paes."shrtiete THE FULNDS.'

MON:Y-MARKEBTandCITYIN-TELLIGENOB. Friday Evening. The revival of confidence is maintained and the purchases of stock by the public to-day have been extraordinarily numerous. The arrival of 520,0001. Australian gold, and the expectation that the amount to be sent to New York by the Persia to-morrow will be less than 200,0001., contributed to the favourable feeling, and althoulgh the applications for discount at the Bank of England were stil very heavy, they were not such, looking at the large advances lately paid off, as to excite increased uneasiness. There was again an absence of commercial failures, a reckless report universally circulated during the afternoon of a large London house connected with the Manchester trade being in difficulties having been ascertained to be totally without foundation. Consolsfor money, wbichleft off yesterdayat 87 to J, were first quoted 87- to 88, whence, owing to a continuous series of investments, they advanced until they touched 887. A partial reaction then occurred, chiefly in consequence of some considerable withdrawals of coin for transmission to various Scotch and Irish '- ks, and the final operations were at 881 to j to money, and 88. to for the 10th of November. In the courseof themorning 22, 0001. Reduced, and 10,0001. Exchequer-biUs were bought by the Government broker for public accounts. The supply of money brought into the Stock-Exchange through the numerous investments caused the rate for loans on Consols until the next account to be as low as 6 per cent. In the foreign market, in consequence of the half-monthly settlement, there was more demand, and. 7 per cent. was freely paid. Bank Stock closed at 211 to 213; Reduced, 87a to I ; New Three per Cents., 87- to 88; India Stock, 207 to 210; India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount; and Exchequer-biUs, 9s. to 4s. discount. In the foreign stock-market there has been an increased demand, and prices show greater firmness. Turkish has advanced 1 per cent. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 100 and 99; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95; Chillian Six per Cents., 102i; Mexican, 19- and E; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 76 and 77; Portuguese, 43; * Sardinian, 89 ; Spanisl;, for the account, 40Q ; ditto, New Deferred, for tbe account, 25g; Turkish Six per Cents., 871, 88k, and 87k; for the account, 87i, #, 88k, and 87- ; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 97j; for the account, 971 and 98; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 639-. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Paris was a shade higher; Amsterdam and HEamburg were about the same as last post. The corn-market was weak this morning at the rates of Monday. The Liverpool cotton-market has at length been influenced by the financial pressure, and has closed heavily at a decline of id. per lb. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 85c. for money and 67f. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of an eighth. About 12,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for transmission to Spain. The Royal Charter and the King Philip have been announced from Melbourne, the former with 360,0001. and the latter with 160,0001. The Omar Pasha, from Sydney, has broupght 3,0001., and the Medway, from Brazil, 1,6901. The total is 524,6901. lt is thought that about a third will be sent to the Continent, and that a portion of the remainder will be sold to the Bank. The commercial accounts from India to-day are not intrinsically bad, the prevailing apprebensions of mischief having resulted almost entirely from mismanagement on the part of the Bank of Bengal. After making profuse advances on Government paper with a margin of only 20 per cent. when it was at a greater discount, they had suddenly found themselves with an inmense quantity of it on their hands, and had then caused a panic by endeavouring to withhold accommodation altogether. At the latest date, therefore, great anxiety existed, money being scarcely procurable on any terms. It is remarked, however, that the supplies in the hands of the native bankers were not deficient, and that they were willingly lending on opium at 8 per cent., while they were refusing 12 per cent. on Government securities-a fact tending to confirm the views expressed in a letter insertedyesterday regarding the bitter distrust perpetuated by the financial conduct of the Government in 1854, since it is attributed to that cause, and not to panic or political disaffection. The specie to be sent by the overland steamer of the 20th is estimated at 700,0001. The Orinoco, West India mail steamer, to sail tomorrow, will take out specie to the amount of 19,1301., of which 8,0001. is silver and 11,1301. gold. The advices from Sydney by the Omar Pasha are to the 25th of July, being Bix days later than the last overland maiL There was no prospect whatever of an overland mail leaving there in August. A dividend had been declared by the Australian Jointstock Bank at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, and by the Australian General Assurance Company at the rate of 20 per cent. per annum. The latter had alao increased their surplus fund to 14,3651. Government debentures were dull at 98. The Australasian Steam Navigation Company had proposed to reduce their capital by writing off 51. per share. Exchange on London had fallen to 2 per cent., in consequence of the Australian sovereigns having been declared a legal tender throughout all the other colonies. The Government had decided to purchase all their commissariat and railway sunplies in England, and had appointed Messrs. Lloyd, Beilby, and Co. their agents for that purpose. The Alfred had arrived from Liverpool with immigrants. The colonial produce-markets during the week, influenced by the further advance in the rate of discount, have been very dull at a general reduction in prices, the accounts received by the overland mail having at the same time diminished the speculative inquiry for various articles from the East which have lately attained extraordinary rates. The news from America, also, has led to the expectation that considerable supplies of goods may be shipped to this kingdom. Sugar has been almost neglected, and the various parcels offered were principally withdrawn, the remainder finding buyers at a decline of between 2s. and 3s. At that reduction, however, there is more inquiry, particularly for floating cargoes, purchases being made for Bristol. A considerable portion of the plantation Ceylon coffee withdrawn last week has been disposed of by private contract, but to-day the public sales went off without much spirit, and at a further fall to the extent of 2s. to 2s.

The former met with buyers at fair prices, but the latter passed off heavily. Privately in fine teas there have been very few transactions. Rice, owing to the excessive quantity offered, showed a fall of 6d. to Is. To-day a better demand has existed at a partial recovery. The few transactions in saltpetre exhibit a further decline, but holders now seem less desirous to press sales, on account of the uncertainty still attending future supplies. The quarterly sales of indigo have gone on steadily, and good to fine shipping qualities have fully supported the advance previously paid by private treaty.

The traffia returns of railways in the united kingdem published for the week ending October 10 amounted to 494,3061., and for the corresponding week of 1856 to 480,6761., showing an increase of 13,630l. The gross receipts of the eight railways having their termini in the metropolis amounted for the week ending as above to 203,2101., and for the corresponding week of last year to 206,2211., shovring a decrease of 3,011L The decreaze on the Eastern Counties Railway amounted to 31; on the Great Western to 1,7291; on the London ana Blackwall to 84 ; on the London and South-Westrn to 1,0221.; and on the South-Eastern to 2,472L ; total, 5,2341.

A special meeting of shareholders in this undertaking was held yesterday at the offices, New Broad-street, Mr. John Labouchere in the cbair. Mr. Cole, the secretary, having read the notice convening the meeting, The CiiaR3uN said the object of the meeting was to acouaint the shareholders with the fact that the conces5ion haa been obtained from the Government of Chili for the continuation of the railway from Pabellon to Chanarcillo, and that the Congress had granted them all the privilegea and exemptions asked for. The directors had solicited a period of 13 years for fixing their own rates of freights and passages, instead of 10 years, and the Government bad acceded to the request of the directors in that respect, but the dividends after the expiration of 15 years, were to be hrmited to 16 per cent. A provisional contract had been entered Into with Mr. Wheelwright for the construction and equipment of the road, and that gentleman had undertaken at his own risk to make his contracts for the immediate commencement of the line. The directors, feeling the importance of having at the head of affairs abroad a gentleman of influence and position, had written to Don Augustus Edwards, the president of the Copiapo and Caldera Railway, to ask him to takethe sameposltion in the extension company. Mr. Edwards had consented to act in that capacity for them, and he would cordiaUy cooperate with the London board. Mr. Edwards had reported to the board that the railway of which he was the president and of which the Copiapo Extension was to form a portion, was doing remarkably well, and paying regular dividends at the rate of from 14 to 16 percent., while the shares were at 50 per cent. premium. Cnder these circumstances the directors had only to ask the shareholdors to sanction the immediate prosecution of the works, Every step had been already taken by Mr. Wheelwright in order that no time might be lost in opening the line. Mlr. Evans, who was charged with the construction of the works, commenced his labours as soon as the concession had been obtained from the Government, and had contracted for the grading, three miles of which had been completed when the last advices left. There was every pro.pect of the line being completed for traffic in July or August, 1S5S. The chairman concluded by moving a resolution anproving the course pursued by the directors and authorizing them to take immediate measures for the prosecution of the works, to apply the deposit towards that object, and to call for such further sums of money as may be required to comDlete the line at the earliest period. The motion was put and carried unanimously, as also were resolutions conveying the thanks of the proprietors to Messrs. Wheelwright and Evans for their services.
STATE OF TRADE. MANCEiESTER, OCT. 16. The depres-ion in this market which was so perceptible at the commencement of the week continues to prevail, and business may at present be said to be altogether at a standQ stiL Prices are maintained with firmness, as there Is no pressare for sales sufficient to produce any abatement, buti actual operations are for the moment suspended in all de- artments under the present aspect of commercial affairs. P'rinting cloths and shirtings have been altogether neglected during the last few days, and in domestics the demand has been limited to the smaUest quantities. The inactirity in yarns has considerably increased during the week, but spinners have been indisposed to concession, and there is consequently no important alteration in price.

SOCIAL ECONOMY. Intbissection, Lord BRocaiMt3i, the President, read the olowing paper on " Railway Accidents:-" The time appears to be com e, if indeed it has not long since arrived, 'when some effectual precaution should be taken for the mecarity of life and limb in railway travel; and there are some propositions on this subject so manifest upon the least attention which can be given to it, that we may venture to begin by stating them, with hardly any demon stration.-1. It is nndeniable that the vast extent of railway traffic renders it not only justifiable but necessary for tLe public authority to interpose and endeavour to prevent nee less risks being run by the community. 2. It is not a valid objection to such interposition that the conduct of their business should be left to the companies themselves, and that the State has no right to interfere with private concerns. The concerns are not private. No railway can be established vwithout an Act of Parliament, and every such Act gives powers not only of an extraordinary but of a transcendental kind to the undertakers. They are authorized t, travel through men's lands without their consent, not by the vendor but by a jury. They have many other privileges by special laws much in their favour, and against the law of the land; but enough has been said on this head when we state that all rights of property, aU settlements by will or by mnarriage contract. all barrgains reviously made by the landowners, are utterly disregar , and the whole is thrown under the power and at the mercy of the companies. 3. It is equally undeniable that when the safety of the publio welfare is concerned we have no right to regard the interest or the caprices of one class any more than the interest or the good pleasure of the railwaycompanies. Suppose it were admitted that certain arrangements are required to eatisfy one, even a considerable body Of persons, if those arrangements are plainly prejudicial to the rest of the tra vellers, net ismerely displeasing to them but perilous to them, the question is decided that such arrangements should not bpermitted and the onlymatter for consideration is how they shall be prevented. 4. It may be alleged that persons unconnected with rai way administration are not sufficiently qualified to form a sound opinion upon the different matters involved in the inquiry whence arise the accidents so nmuch complained of, and how they are to be prevented. But this being admitted as a general proposition, it may very likely be also quite true that there are some things so palpably evident that any one is as capable of tnderstanding them as if he had spent all his life at a railway board, and that no proof needs be given of them, because they are next to self-evident. Now, to apply these general principles there wants hut little consideration of the subject. ln the first place. without the least railway experience, every one must be aware that the whole plant and all the carriages and tackle of a railway are Inevitably tnd cor.stantly undergoing a great wear and tear, very much greater than in any other traveling establishment, because the great velocity of the movement unavoidably increases the friction exceedingbly and causes more jolts and other concussions which directlyaffect the rails, and the carriagee, and the tackle. Secondly,-The disposition of the companies will always be to grudge the necessary outlay for repairing damage and preventing its recurrence, because the amount of the dividend is the primary object in order t) mnaintain the marketvalue of the shares; andtheir manner of grudging it will be unxiderrating the necessity. Thirdly,-Tho namage occasioned by wear and tear has an unavoidable tendency to increase the geometrical progression, each injury, if not remedied, becoming the foundation of other injuries. Fourtbly, -If there can he pointed out a cause either certain or very likely to produce injuries, either by increasing unnecessarily the wear and tear, or by augmenting the number of concu,ssions, or by rendering tbem greater when they do happen, or even only by increasing the risk of their happening, that caurse ought to be removed at once, instead of trusting to the efficacy of vigilant superintendence, or in*tuiring into the existence of injuries as actually sustained. becausesuch superintendence and injury may or may not prove effectual, whereas the removal of the cause must altogether prevent tlsc evil or greatly lessen its amount; and we are here speaking only of the wear and tear. Fifthly, -Such wear aDd tear must, if not either prevented or remedied, occadion so great a rislc of accident as almost to become a certainty. Sixthly,-The length of time that sost of the great railways have been established makes it muanifest that they have very isiuch greater chance of accidents now than they ever had before. Seventhly,The prevention of accidents otherwise than by the effects of wear and tear is most likely also to he secured by whatever lessens that ear and tear, as by accidents caiused by concussions and by collisions. Now all these considerations point to ene thing-the great speed of the mounments ; and it is too clear to require a word of proof that whatever lessens the speed dimtinishes the wear and tear. the injuries to the carriages, the risks of their running off the line, and if they do of their being damaged, and the risks of colfisioni either with other carriages or with fixed obstacles. It is enough to name the rates in order to be satisfied that they expose to serious risks of collision, and produce tho certraisty of great wear and tear. Hardly any rate is known in this country under an average of 40 miles an hour-while soiie have 50, and some as much as 60, or a snile a .minute ; and even ,wbere such is not the averago excessive speed is occasionally given to make up for lost time. So that an average of 40 implies occasionally one of GO, and an average of 00 one of 70, SO. or it may be mnore. Now, it is quite nianifest that the risks aro very great, arising from such rapid movement, both by the damrage done to the rails, carrss"es, and tackle, anud by the accidents thence arising; an& also, ,where no mischief arises from the dlsrepair, from the collisions and other consequences of rapid movement, and the prevention of such movement removes the risk, and renders the travelling reasonably safe, even If a very considerable speed shonld still be perissitted. Suppose the maxiemns of 2:5 or .10 miles an hour were fixed, and a prohibitiun of exceeding this in order to imake up lost time; in a word. suppose the inconvenience to be inflicted upon travellers of arriving somewhat later at theirjourney's end, and of occasionally waiting at the station on account of some accidental del3y, not allowed to be prevented by increase of speed, can this be put in the balance and weighed against tho absolute, or nearly absolute, securitv against had accidents which vvould thus be given? That is the only question, and it'ldes not seem to admit of n.uch douht. Let it be observed that no reference bas been made to the clear opinion given by the most experienced engineers, suob as Mr. G. Stephenson, upon the too great speed being the cause of accidents, because it is better to rely upon the nature of the thing itself, and no testimony, nor any authority, is wanted to provo that such rapid niotion must produce the consequences ascribed to it. Then it remains to consider tho justification of the proposed probibitiois. The advantases of such travelling, .^s saving time, and thus giving valuable facilitics to the transaction of business, as well as accomisiodation to persons bellt upon change of residence for other pursuits, cannot be denied. Nor can it be doubted that there are i3ary vho, iH asked whether they would, for the salie cf the speed, incur the risk, wrould answer in the affirmative. But it is equally undeniable that a very great majority of thoFe who travel would prefer the security. and declare thenuselves satisfird with a moderate speed-with going from Lonidoni to York or liverpool in eight hours, and to Edinburgh ill ten. NWhv are they to be sacrificed because some others insist on muioving vith double that speed? It is a common remalrk of thcse who reflect little upon the subiect that if accideusts happen it is the fault of the public, which calls for S(or OP nuiles an hour; and they add, rolesti nonfit i71s1rao. But the so?loftes are only few comparatively, and the body of the rravellers-that is. the public, make no such demand. The anxious vigilancowith whichourlaw, like that of all civilized coimmunities, watches over life is not to be lost sight of. Sevpre punishment is inflicted on any carelessness from which fatal cense n enes result, only less severe than v hat is intlloed when deliberate intention off mischief is proved. Nay, the act of self-destruction is regarded as a great offence, and wboever is so grossly negligent of his ow^n personal safetv as to occasion his death without intending it niay be said to commit an offence which bears the same relation to suicide 'hat manslaughter does to muyder. But suppose a person, at the request of anotber, puts him to death, tbe law treats this as murder. These remarks apply, first, to the class who hazard their own lives in the desure to save time; they are incurring the moral guilt of an offence akin to suielde; but, next, the remarks apply to the same class as risking tho lives of others. and thnus oommitting a meost grievous oflence. It is manifest that the risk which they run themselves is no defence against the charge of involving others in the same hazard, any more than a dueUist stands acquitted of risking away hlis neighbour's life by the fact tbat he also risks his own. But we have here to dea3- not ^ib41. ;+h IhO q_ . je, not wlith tile mmnon,ty or their conduot iru requiring the dangerous rate of travelling, our concern Is with the supreme power in the State, the Legislature, which is bound to watch over the safety of the wbole community, and to prohibit such conduct as exnoses its safety to unnecessary bazardshazards, too, of the grossest description. If It should be said that thae fixing of a inaximaun speed, with the prohibition of exceeding it to make up for lost time accidentally Incurred, vould diminish the security of the public by naking the companies morc carele.s, the answer is that this never couLd he the resu:t as long as the present liabilities Continued; because no one contends that by fixing the amaximuni the law shotuld declare the parties ahsolved from all other duty except tbat of no' exceeding tho prescribed rate. Every other neglect would be eitber punishable as an offence, or entail the reparation, by way of damages, aecording to the nature of the negligence; and it would be no kind of deforce. nor even any matter of extenuation so as to nitigate the sentence in the case, if the party proved that the requisition of the law respecting speed had been scrupulously complied with. There can be no doubt that in France. Germany, and Bolgium, where the rate does not exceed 25 miles an hour, sccidents are very much more rare than in this coutLtry. It can be as little denied that by better regulations tirme might be saved at the stations both here and in those countries. It may be probably found expedient for the benefit both of the shareholders and of the public to introduce a better s'stem of management by paying the functionaries more liberally, and casting more entire responsibility upon thbm, so as to suffer no interference of the unpaid directors. But this is a large subject, and connects itself with the whole railway administration, as well as the branch immediately under consideration-the prevention of accidents." In the discussion which followed the reading of this paper and of another on the same subject, Mr. J. S. WRIGliT said, that he traveUed much, and usFully by express trains, and he believed that acciden' seldom occurred from speed. Mr. G. DAWSON supported this view, and maintaiaed that speed was one of the last causes of accident. Professor MILLER expressed an opinion adverse to the continuous employment of engine-drivers for seven days a- week, which he thought a fertile cause of accident. PUBiLIC HEALTH. A paper was read by Mr. RumSEy in this section on ISome of the Deficiencies of Sanitary Legislation and Administration in England and Wales." The time, he said, had arrived when they might reasonably call for something like philosophical legislation on the whole grouD of ques- tions, when the cmlhra dijccta of hygienic lawv might be I reclaimed and connected, when the incoherent and abortive attempts to remedy particular insalubrities might yield to something like a system of sanitary pandects worthy of so great and intellgent a nation. The sources of past legislative error might, he believed, generaUy be traced to those contracted and defective views of State medicine which prevailed not only in Parliament and among the people, but, he was corry to say, in the medical profession itself. One evidence of popular misconception on this subject was that laws which were intended to ret' a e not one-tenth part of the matters included under the title were caled "Public Health Acts." The effect of this bestowal of a generio designation upon specific measures was a direct injury to the cause they advocated. The unthinking majority were led to identify the question of public health with towncouncils and town sewers, and both these often proving nuisances as impracticable as thcse they were intended to remove, the whole subject was proscribed, while the amendment and codification of sanitary law,including the organization of an effective official corps for their execution-reforms of incalculable moment to society-were treated as details of mere local management and inferior interest. Instead of limiting sanitary measures to towns, the whole of Britain should be included in sanitary districts. Were this done he believed the Legislature would find no difficulty in restricting the application of great structural works to certain parts or wards of those districts. Among the reasons which might be urged against conferring measures of public health to separate communities witbin defined boundaries were the following :-I. The rapid ertension of the areas of towns with a greater diffusion of their populations (the main point to which sanitary reforms should tend) must render those boundaries a constant.subject of change, dispute, and litigation. 2. So long as the adoption of a Pablio Health act was optional with the Inhabitants of any circomscribed spot, strong efforts would be made by a parish-vestry party to exempt their little sphere of petty authority from legal responsibility. o. The actual condition of some of the excluded *districts, especially those immediately surrounding the jurisdictions of existing boards of health, imperatively demaried their inclusion. 4. All analogy was against restricting laws of general benefit to particular places. The administration of justice, the management of the poor, the religious (he wished he could say the secular and industrial) education of the people, were happily not confined to places in which they were called for by the inhabitants. What would have been the result of limiting that great and beneficial social reform, the Poor Law Adiendout Act, to parishes which petitioned for its adoption? What would be thought of a Constabulary Act which enabled certain districts avowing themselves to be particularlv ihonest, 'moral, and quiet, to claimn freedom from visits of the polce ? Chalmers long ago showed that opposition to measures of improvement affecting the highest interests of man would in all probability proceed from the very places which most needed. those measures. The demand for ememption vwonld be the proof of their necessity. Peculiar to this country was its method of constituting local administrative bodies9-a inethod which immensely., aggravated the evils inseparable from isolated and densely peopled jurisdictions. Instead of admitting a repreEentation of all classes of the people from aU sorts of localities-instead of infusing a leaven of dlsinterested and cultivated thoughlt, speech, and action into the local boards -the riglht of memberahin was by law confined to those whose private interests woie often involved in maintaining the density of population and other local causes of physical and moral degradation-to persons, therefore, who oould seldom have wholly escaped the moral infection of their corrupted social atmaosphere. The sole personal qualification required for the arduous task committed to them is that either of owning property of a ce'rtain value ozr f paying rates to a certain aniount. No security whatever was taken by the l'ublic Health Act or thelMetropolitan Management Act for the possession of higher qualifications,-mental competency, philanthropic zeal, freedom from Interest in existing abuses, or special knowledge of the arts and sciences concerned in public hygiene. He was far from doubting that many of our local boards, bowever strangely constituted, had done much for the sanitary improvemnent of their towns. He granted that the rough and ready method of the Anglo-Saxon often led to a result much more satisfactory than could have been expected from the process; but it was also no less certain that many remarkable blunders, absurd or lamentable, or both, had been committed by the new local boards, and the general impression was unfavourable to'their efficiency. Consistently with these primary defects in our system of local orgarnization, was the adoption by the Legislature of the singular principle that unless the inhabitants should voluntarily accept the reform an excessive death rate must be shown before the Act could be applied. He (Mr. Rumsey) contended that the execution of laws for the prevention of disease ought not to be delayed -a sanitary organization ought not to be refused-until circumstances had arisen manifestly to shorten human life, In the discussion which foUowed, Dr. SramoN, of London, observed that it was for the people rather than Government to bring a proper pressure to bear upon local bodies disinclined to carry out the requisite sanitary measures. If the people were too apathetic and remiss to rebel against the blundering Bunibledom which poisoned them, letthem die. (A laugh.) He would venture to state what appeared to him somae very obvious propositions which occurred to him on this subject. First, primary rudimental sanitary powers should be possessed all over the land; no place should be without the powers necessary for its own protection against preventable disease, Then, he also thought it requisite that in this country the exercise of those powers should be by local elective autborities, subject to the least interferecxe, the least central control, consistent with the due protection of unrepresented interests. What were the unprotected interests ? What was the due protection which should be afforded them ? These were questions of detail admitting of discussion ; but about the accuracy of the general principle there could be littlo doubt. One such interest was the interest of life. He heard much of a ratepaying interest, for which he had great respect but life was a great interest too. Many lived, and, alas ! many died, who were not ratepayers. The interests also of posterity, bound by the mortgages of local boards, should likewise be considered; and an appeal to some central authority was indispensable for the protection of those interests. In other words, local autharity, as it had full awing so long as it did not burden posterity. should come to Government to sanction the purpose for which the mortgage on posterity was to be applied. Then there was another principle for which one might contend, namely, that any place which the Govermment believed to be unduly unhealthy should he examined and reported on. It was a matter of notoriety that there were parts of the country where the death-rate was double that in other districts. Three-eighths, or about 40 per cent., of all our deaths were of children under five years of age. But this mortality varied greatly according to district; for while in some places children had a reasonable chance of life, in others they died three times as fast. Then look at the long list of preventable diseases. In the seven years from 1S4R to 1854. 20,000 deaths a-year occurred from typhus. Then 135,000 deaths were assigned to the epidemics of cholera, This was in England and Wales. Now, where evidence existed of these preventable diseases prevailing to an undue extent he thought a certain responsibility devolved on Parliament. If members of Parliament had occasion to go among courts and alleys in the towns they represented, they would not, perhaps, as they sometimes did, caU the statements of medical men exaggerated; bnt unfortunately there were no votes in courts and alleys. (A laugh.) Though, however, Parliament could not inquire by means of individual members, It might inquire through a department, Such an inquiry should be made, not with a view to cercion, but ir order that the facts might be before the public. He would have this inquiry instituted whenever the death-rate in a particular locality was above the average of the country for the time being. These were obvious principles, which might be acted upon without any undue encroachment upon theliberty of individuals, corporations, and local bodies. As far as he could judge, nothing was so desirable for the welfare of the country as that there should be vigorous local Government. The greatness of England depended, no doubt, in an infinitely great degree upon what had been done by corporations of one kind and another. You could not respect this voluntary co-operation too highly, when these bodlies were willing to work honestly and steadfastly fo: the public good. But let them work, and not altogeth6r stand still. If they did stand still, inquiry and publicity, considering the great interests at stake, would ho of the utmost advantage. (H[ear, hear.)~~~~~~~~~~Her 3Ir.

I 1n early EBnglish days, when population was scanty, manufacturing on a large scale unknown, the links between man and man close and numerous-whon buslness was conducted in a leisurely and humane feahiou-when habits of life were simple. and mere property interests kept in check by influences which those intereats have now prevailed over altogether, laisser faire was a principle unknown. Checks and counter ohecks, regulations and ordinances, were the rule everywhere. The fashion and material of garments, the cost and number of dishes at meals, every proess in every manufacture, tho minutest details of home and foreign trade, were matters strictly regulated by law of some kind or other, some by Act of Parliament, some by town charter, some by guild ordinances. It is difficult for us to realize the amount of social restraint to which men submitted in those times, and without uomplaint either. "All through thesecarliertimes, it hasbeentrmly remarked, responsibility will be found the great living principle of all the social arrangements. The apprentice bound himself to obey the apprentice rules of his guild and the orders of his minaster, aild the master, in turn, bound himseli to look to the education, maintenance, and discipline of the apprentice. The members of the guild bound themselves to mutual succour,-amnenablenes.s to tho ordinances of their society and the commands of its elected and sworn offieers, and sneh obligations lasted as long as life and reached down to the nlanutest matters of business and daily usage. " Responsibility lies at the very root of our parochial system. The tithing was, under another name, the old Saxon association of frith borgh, ' pledge of peace,' or, as it was erroneously translated into Anglo-Norman, ' Frankpledfie,' by which each group of 10 householders became pledges, each to all, and all to each. for the orderly and legal behaviour of the body. The tithings were the nuclei of 'our parishes. These tithings again were greuped by tens into hundreds, and the hundreds into shires with a chain of subordinatod local authorities and courts linking them all together. From the tithing-man, head, borough, X. c., head of the mutually pledged men, borseholder or elder of the pledged men, through the hundredor, sheriff, and ealderman uptothe Eing, was a. chain of gradually enlarging links thatheld seeytgto rmislwx to its highest layer, society toether from its loweat "Eah othse ocal ecion wthlitlimitswascomplete for all the simple purposes of life, as it then was. The men of the tithing saw to the repair of their own roads, the cleansing and maintenancoe of their own watercourses, their own watch and ward, and hue and cry. They bad their a en court leet. When the country was assessed in any very extraordinary need it was by the tithings that the assessrnent was managed; when soldiers were to be levied, or an emergency requiring more men than the obligations of feudal tenure could bring into the field, it was by tichiogs that the levy was made; in short, the tithing, for aU purposes of life within its limits, was a complete social unit, ike the germ cell of animal organization, coalescing again to form higher organismns of hundred, county, and realm. "In those days there was little division of labour anywhere. As on the farm the householder raised his own food, brewed his own drink, spun and wove his own garments, was his own smith, cartwvright, mnason and carpenter; as in the manufacturing guilds every process, from the unpackiRg of the raw material to the turning out of the finished article, was generally carried on by the same hands, - so, in the organization of the tithing, every man was, in turn, judge, soldier, policeman, way-warden, inspector and abater of nuisances; instead of paying lawyers to talk for him, soldiers to fight for him, police to guard his lfe and goods, surveyors to repair his roads, sanitary inspectors to snuff out his foul ditches. He was of ten his own doctor into the bargain. The care of his soal was the only duty, of life he devolved systematicaly on a specially trained consecrated class. There is somothing in this state of sooiety so completely in controst with our own,-there is so much of completeness in its manhood when set against our own fragmentary and imperfectly developed humanity; so much of cohesion and independence in its relations of classes, when compared with our own, separated by yawning golfs and chasms so awfuly hard to brldge over-so much of unselfishness, publicity, and mutual bearing of burdens; so much that is noble and manly and genial, that it is no wonder if many of those who have studied it closely should become enamoured of it, and see in the disuse of its syatems the secret of much that is most deplorable in ocr days. "I would not confound those who, after seriously and earnestly studying the history of our early institutions write passionately in theirpraise and vehemently call for their restoration, with the vulgar declaimners, who mask under the cryr of ' local self-government' their an:eiety to win a clear field for small jobs, petty authorlty, and the unchecked rule of number one. "With the former class, of which Mr. Toulmin Smith may be taken as the organ and type, ' local self-government' is the compendious designation of a most elaborate system, which aims at securing the discharge of duties quite as much as at acquiring the posession of power and the entry to the ratepavers' pockets. " With the latter class, of which the experience of most of my hearers will suggest only too many examples, ' local self.government' is another namae for the unchecked rule of the least informed, noisiest and narrowest, or, as often, of the most self-seeking, who can achieve seats in a towncounoil or at a local improvement board. " In what follows I propose to deal with ' local selfgovernment' in the sense of the former of these schools. " Mr. Toulmin Smith, in his work on the parish, which may be regarded at once as a manual, and an eulogium of local self-government in this sense, quotes a pregnant saying ofthelate Duke of Wellington. 'IWhile everyone," wrote the Duke, ' is accustomed to rely upon the Government, upon a sort of commutation for what they pay to it, persona energy goes to sleep, and the end is lost. This supineness and apathy as to public exertion will in the end ruin us.' "No one who is accustomed to watch the workingof local institutions will dispute Mr. Smith's allegation, that there can be no greater or more deplorable mistake than the very common notion that all a man's relation to the towvn or parish he lives in is comprehended in paying rates when called upon. So, I apprehend, all sound thinkers will agree with him that the sense of mutual responsibility must be continually present to every man if free institutions are to be a reality, and not a mere name; that a necessary accompaniment of this habitual sense isthe feeling and taking an active interest in the welfare of the neighbourhood, and the direction of the intelligence of all to matters affecting the weUbeing of all. Even if local affairs were managed with some waste of time and money and some unskllfulness, when all thus participate in their management the waste and unakilfulness would be wvel made up for by the zeal, sense of duty, and invaluable practical education that is thus fostered and supplied. " But I cannot agree with Mr. Smith that the prevailing under estimnrte and negleot of local dutias are the result of attempts made of late years to overlay the institutions of England, alike in working andin spirit, by the system of bureaucracy and functionarism.' So far as such a system can be said to exist I cannot but consider it rather as a result than as a cause of the neglect of local duties. "Mr. Smith appears to think that in every department of the Government lurk certain mysterious enemies of everything ancient and English and local, always on the lookout to curtail a parochial power here, a corporate function there, equally greedy of authority and public pence-true 'hungry offiCals,' devoid alike of capacity and honesty, equally deficient in a sense of public duty and respect for private morality. " I am inclined to think-it may be because I am myself a servantin one of these departments which Mr. Smith considers more peculiarly peopled by these official ogres-that Mr. Smith, on this point, is labouring under a delusion which tends to impair the value of his books and to limit the good effect of his meritorious labours. There may, of course, be a mischievous and mistaken 'centralism,' just as there is a spurious ' localism'-the one striving to establish Procrustean systems of its own, to weaken local liberty, and to substitute for thehealthy variety of indepen- dent action a vicious and shortsighted uniformity regulated I from the centre, just as the other seeks to establish the rule of unmitigated selfishness and penny wisdom under the specious mask of local liberty. "But of these two equally mischievous inflnencesIshould be inclined to think the former infinitely iess potent for evil and less prevalent than the latter for this reason *- Central doctrinairism is absolutely antagonistic to the spirit of England; local selfishness appeals for the furtherance of its own mean ends to dispositions peculiarly and nobly -But, setting aside rare exceptions,I should be inclined to assert that in the general working of central departments, charged with duties which bring them into contact with local authorities, the tendency is rather to over-timidity I than to excessive dictation ; and, instead of the disposition of the public being to throw too much into the hands of the central power, it is rather to an excessive dislike of all its action, and an exaggerated suspicion both of its means and inclinations to intrude or encroach upon local institations. I cannot bat attribute the neglect of local duties not to ever-encroaching officialism, but to ever-increasing selfishness-the result of excessive addiction to moneymaking-of concession to the daily larger demands of each man's private business upon his time and energies-of a f orgetfulnossof theclaims of all classes of societynpon each other -of that want of sympathy between rich and poor mainly due to the vast operations of the new industrial economy created by steam power, which tends to accumulate great capitals in single hands, and to group huge masses of workmen about particular centres of labour. Owing to the joint action of these causes our local subdivisions have, in many cases, become unmanageable by purely local machinery. Think of the old relations of the tithing being revived in a district of Manchester, or of this great ' caplital of the Midlands,' in which we are assembled ! We might as well seek to restore the old trade guilds, with their liveries and feasts, tbeir pageants and mlracle-plays, or the Heptarchy, with its warring kings, its gesithas, its thegns, and theows. -Local seLf-governmcnt,in the sense inwhichit existed in those simple and primitive germs of our present local divisions, was possible only for snch communities. But, to cherish and encourae and restore the spirit which devised it aid kept it working should be the first object of any association that proposes to itself the advancement of social science. For in that spirit lies the very key-note of all social science that deserves the name. That spirit it was which taught all men to regard each other as brothers and fellow-citizens, to value local power as a trust to be administered for the good of all, and to postpone all individual Interest where it clashed with the public good. "What is still working of that spiritis the salt of English publl life; and, Heaven knows, the mass of mean and miserable shams which it has to leaven, and even then can scarcely prevent from stinking in the nostrils of all honest and earnest men! But,-in the whirl of complicated affairs, among the incessant demands of private interests, stimulated by the closest competition, the bewlldering action and counteraction of class-wants and claims, and the selfishneas bred of too excluive a pursuit of material advancement,-it is no wonder if the most public-spirited, the most anxious to do their best for the interests of the community of which they are a part, should often find themselves more and maore perplexed and baffled, and discover, to their dismay, that active participation in local affairs too oftenz resolves itself into an unsuccessful struggle with the grossest ignorance, the most offensive mob oratory, and the most sordid self-seeking. Only very stout hearts indeed can long maintain the struggle. The temptation is too often irresistible to withdraw from the town-council or local board, and to seek in the exercise of a more aecluded benevolence for a satisfaction of those inward urgings to unselfish duty which can find no useful employment in the public arena without. "I maintain that the central action may most benefictally be called in aid of local self-government when the latter is most animated by a patriotio aud unselfish spirit, It may, and should, act as an ally of real local self-government against spurious local self-government. "If we could attain the best concelvable local self-government, It is probable there would be no need for central aid, counsel, or interference. But it is a palpable fact-every man's experience teems with proof of it-that we do not, except in a minority of cases, command for local government the best local materials. 'In our greatclties-thecentres of manufacturingindustry -the same shrewdness and intelligence which are brought to bear on private enterprise are laid under contribution to a large extent for local government, But, In our second and third-rate towns the quality of the material of local government is, I fear, deteriorating rather than improving; at aU evenis, it is in daily danger of deterioration. " And it is from tho best, instead of the worst, elements of local self-government in such places that the demand is loudest for counsel, aid, and support from the centre. It becomes daily more difficult for the notables of such towns to acquire that light of wide and general experience which, ,if a central department be worth anything, it ought to be able to supply; and there are certain necessities which, as it seems to me, on constitutional principles, some central authority or other mnust be called in to meet in even the best local administration. For example, with regard to the borrowing of those large amounts of money necessary to meet the first cost of great public works, as of drainage or water supply, where this last is not in the hands of a com- pany. Parliament is the only authority which has power ti) !urden posterity. The right of local rating is limited ts the year. It is only by some delegation of the power of ParLiamert that a local authority can be enabled to impos l in thare provisions of Vethe M^unicipal CorpoPrations Act, by which the sanction of the Treasury is required to any mortgage or alienation of corporate property. * ' In local Improvement Acts the powver of mortgaging rat~ isconcdedby Prlimentliteac Cawe b a special enactment. But in any general measure of town improvement to be adopted by, or applied to, many places, the power can only be conferred by requiring the sanction of some central department to each act of borrowing. "Thecases in which Parliament does give absolute borro w- iog powers to a local authority without further sanction are those in which it has been proved in committee that the works, the proposed expenditure, and amount to be borrowed are such as should properly be allowed, `In this case Parliament Iself takes care of the local posterity in the first instance, and no further investigation or decision is needed, and this leads me naturally to the question how the central atthority is to ac' in conferring tbe necessary powers of local self-government. "Few persons will be found at the present time inclined to defend the system by which alone powers of local selfgovernment, other than those given to parishes by the commaon law and certain statutes, as the Highway Act, are now conferred by Parlianient. " The system of Local Acts stands condemned by general consent on the ground of extravagant costliness, no less than on reasons arising from the objectionable character of the Private Bill Committ-e as a tribunaL " Though Parlianment has hitherto shrank from divesting itself of its functions in private Bill legislation, it has admitted by reports of its committees the wors. evils of the system, and has applied paUiatives which, though they misy have removed some of its worst scandals, still leave the cosyt of private Bills so high that smaller towns shrink from the outlay. Under these circumstances either of two plans night be suggested in lieu of the present system of town improvement BUIS. 'Parhament mnight, asinthe case of the Municipal Corporations Act, appoint a commission to examine aU existing local Acts, to ascertain what aggregates ofpopulation practis. cally constituting towns exist, withoutt any of the powers required for town government, and thus to furnish the Government with the materials of a general measure to be applied to all towns without distinction which did not already posses the powers it should confer. " The objections to this plan arise first fromnthevery great number of existing local Acts conferring powers for town improvement, and the interest and debts which have grown up under these, and next from the fact that even if these could be dealt with in any single measure there would then remain large numbers of dense populations as yet uncomaprehended under any legal local designation, and for which boundaries must be determined before they can obtain the character of towns. "The only other alternative open is for Parliament'to vest in some central body directly amenable to its authority the duty of fixing new town boundaries, and of fusing into an intelligible whole the powers of existing local Acts and those of any general measure which Parliament may empower the inhabitants of any district to adopt. " But t!'e intervention of central authority in some form or other is necessary for conferring powers of local selfgovernment. "Again, is there, or is there not, a responsibility on those invested with such powers for their due exercise ? Are local powers a trust for the public advantage, or a means of enforcing the supremacy of local cliques, and a machinery for rewarding local partisanshlp with power, patronage, and place ? ' If, as Icontend, suchpowers are a public truat, thentheir exercise ought to be watched and recorded on behalf of the public ; the lessons which the experience of each place supplies ought to be deduced and made known for the benefit of all; glaring instances of neglected duty and their consequences should be stigmatized, conspicuous examples of activity and well-directed efforts and theoir results shouldl be held up for imitation. "This duty, to be performed not for a single town or district, but for the whole kdngdom, belongs to the central authority, which acts for the kingdom, and turns local facts to general use, whether by way, of warning or example. 'Somewouldaddto these central duties that ofactingas a court of appeal against local oppression, and as a court of mandamus in cases of local default. "1 Even Mr.Toulmin Smith, in his outUne of what he conaiders conAtitutional legislation for the public health, pro. poses an additional Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, to wlhom It should be the duty of the authorities in every place to sendcannual returns on certain specified heads, and would make it competent for this under secretary if at any tine those returns were unsatisfactory, to take proper measures,in the Court of Queen's Bench, to compel the execution of proper works, Of such an officer, according to Mr. Smith's plan, any indivldual in any place is to be empowered to demand as a right the issue of a formal requisition to his local authorities for the doing of any matter or workwhich the public welfare is thought to need, or the giving proof that such work is already sufficiently done, or willyl,1 not be needed. "This proposal must be regarded as a strlding admission on the part of one so averse as Mr. Smith to all central action in local matters that some oo-ordinatlon of the two kinds of power is necessary. It matters nothing whether this duty of conspelling the discharge of local duties is vested in a committee of the Privy Council or In the Home-office. " Reviewing what has been said, it will be found that tho necessity of central action on matters of local inprovement is maintained,- " L To confer powers for such improvement cheaply and effectuaDy; to invest with the legal character of ' towvns' areas of dense population not having yet acquired a known and defined boundary; and to fuse into a consistent whole existing local Acts, and a general measure of town Improvemnent. "12. When such powers are conferred, to forvwardI generally the wise and eficPient exercisefof them by diffusing the lgh of a general experience, and by communicating the results of such special inquiries as the central department may he charged to make, by advising In cases of doubt or diculty, and generally by assisting, butnever superseding, "3. To protect posterity by examining and deciding upon application for leave to mortgage rates. " 4. By reportlng to Parliament on the examination of local powers. " 5. By acting as a court of appeal against local oppression in certain specified cases, and a court of mandamus In casos of local default. "1I have spoken of towlinimprovement generally,forlI conceive it imposdble to picknout any particular functions of the town-improving authority which can be said peculiarly to concern the public health. "c Improvement in the healthof ga town popunlation is the best evidence that the towrn is well governed. Neither have I made any attempt to enumerate the other duties distinct from those directly relating to town improvement, which a central department may perform for general enlightenment on hygienic questions, and to forward the infant science of preventive medicine,. " In conclusion, I would wish very distinctly to reiterate the opinion that local improvement is primarily and specially a local duty; that the central authority which should attempt to supersede the fulfilment of this local duty by local agenev, instead of aiding, enlightening, and insisting upon Its fulfilment,would be-following a mischievousand mistazen course; and that unless It be found that central action Is roquired to make local action efficient, there is no reason for keeping up its machinery and employing its functionaries. In reply to a question from tr. HiELPS, Mwr. TAYLOR said that instaices had beetngivern in which towns that had admittedI the Public Health Act, after a great deal of opposition had worked well; but in other cases there had been a falling off in the zeal with 'which the Act was worked. In some cases litigation hadl been the result of the introduction of the Act, which had causefdgreat dissatisfaction, Mr. SL.%-EY, l.P., thought that one great difficulty was that of obtaining rating powers, and for which large majorities were required. He suggested that where any portion of the required sum was provided by voluntary donations or subscriptions the requisit-e majority might be proportIonally decreased. This was not a new principle, and he thought it mnight be well introdluced into sanitary matters. After observations from some other gentlemen, Lord STAN-LEY summied up the results of the cliscussion in the following terms :-The general feeling seems to be that indicated in Air, Taylor's paper-namely, that so far as any general rule can be laid down the local body should have the power of action, and the general body that of instruction and supervision-that is to say, that the position the central goverinment should assume in regard to all local authorities is that it shoulId say so long as you do your work well you shall be left to do it in your own way ; we will not interfere with youL; bitt if during a long series of years you decline or are unable to do it It will become our business to see that the duties of the office are properly dis- r OvTIIrVOOD Swsm~ read a paper on "1The Prolongstion of Life duoring the 18th Century," a recordl of which 'we possessed ini the great tontines of 1693 and 1790, the inxterval beinig exactly a century short of three years. On eachi of those occasions a loan for the service of the State was raised, thefirst byWilliam and Maryand thessecond by William Pitt. In the case of a tontine by which a person advancing 1001, was at liberty to namesa life during which he drew a certain annuity It evidently offered the strongest induceinent for the shareholder to name the youngest and healhiet inanthe culdselet. t ws clear therefore that, at al eents suh ony wuld e nmedas would justify the expecatio of on lie, Te totineof 18(910 consisted of 438 emaes nd 5t mles andtha of1790 of 3,974 females and4,17 mles Th latertoninewas not yet extinct, females and 977 iales u t of the oriinad numer,s t the difference between the mortality of the nominees of 1690 and 1790 was not yet so great as it would ultimately be. TakInthese data, Mr. Finlaison, the Government calcu. bator, wrorked out in a very elaborate manner the means of making a comparison between them and their actual prolongation, and the life in tho 17th century was proved, first, by the difference in the death rate of the two periods, and next by the addition of an ascertained number of years to the age of each individuaL It was thus shown that In the year 1690 the expectation of life of a managed 30 would ave een as 26-565,while in 1790 it would have been 33-775 while the actual addition of the excess of years which the persons engaged in the latter tontine had over the former proved that in 1790 the expectation of life was increased by fully one-fourth; that is to say, that If in 1690 a person aged 30 could erpect to live 30 years, in 1790 a person of the same age could reasonably expect to live 37 years. Au Increase in the duratlon of life was a proof of increased comforts, or increased enjoyment of certain elements upon which human life is dependent, such as air, light, food, rmth, and shelter. In fact, what we called progress in civilization was an improvement in the means of securing regularly and unfailingly, in abundance and uriy, those phy.sical agents for the bulk of the population. The accomplishment of this object was the main cause of all the activity and energy by whlch a state of civilization was characterized. It was a matter of familiar history that an extraordinary activity reignea throughout the 15th century. Forests were cleared, marshes and swamps drained, and from the more settled government of the country cities and towns, being no longer fortresses, had extended beyond the walls of their fortifications. But at this period special attention began to be paid to the well ordeng, cleaning, and paving of towns. The narrow streets were widenled, slate recfs substituted for thatch, bicks for timber, and the manufacture of glass so much in- creased that glass windows, even in the poorer towns, became common. Agriculture made a surprising advance, rusitipyinga hndrd-fod te prducionof freslx vegetable food, and increasing in a stil more remarkable degree the mount of fresh animal food by the extension of the comnparatively new art of colleoting and storing fodder for cattle in winter. The increase of manufactures gave improved and cheap clothing to the people not only conducive to wvanuth and health, but almost equally so to cleanliness, the texture compelling_ frequent washing. Accordingly disease assumed Pa milder form, and ep:demica in particular became much less formidable. Dr. Smith concluded by asking if the advancing civilization of the 18th century was accompanied by such a prolongation of life, what must have been latterly gained? It was clear that even at present the classes which formed the base of the pyramid of society lost a great portion of life; and it was the duty and noble aim of this association to remove-for it was removable-this crying disgrace to our country, to bring this unhappy class within the pale of civilization. Until that was done the columns of the Registrar-General would give no fair result ot sanitary M- provement. How far the time of life, however, in the aggregate could be extended they did not know, but it was plain that it was not possible as yet to assign a definite limit. (Cheers.) Mr. JFPiR1CI, In illustration of the facts givea in the paper, said that the average duration of life in London at present was 27 years, whereas in the last century it was only 22. The connexion between sanitary precautions and the prolongation of life was well illustrated by the healthy condition of the inmates of modern prisons. Mr. ROBERT OWVzp stated that the infant schools established by him were extremely healthy. Lord BRoUo sitAM said that he was desirous to give honour where honour was due, and he therefore took the opportunity of stating that, although a pension had been given to tr. Wilberforce, as the person who had introduced the system, the idea originated with Mhr. Owen. BIRMINGHAM, Fsxmty. According to the programme, the business of the seotions ought to have been brought to a close yesterday, but so numerous were the papers to be read, and so lively and prolonged the discussions, that much remained to be done this morning. Miss Carpenter read a paper on "Female Reformatories," and her audience was large, enthusiastic, and grateful. Though it was out of the settled order of proceedings to do so, Lord Brougham moved, and Sir J. Pakingtoa supported, a special vote of thankg to this lady for her contribution to social science. In the department of Juribprudence and Amendment of the Law Lord John Russell and the secretaries were occupied In settling the report to be laid before the general meeting; and in the section devoted to Public Health, Lord Stanley, who presided, felt so reluctant to adjourn the consideration and discussion of several papers not yet read that the proceedings were prolonged, and the large assemblage gathered together in tne theatre of the Midland Institate had not the advantage of his Lordship's presence. At noon the general meeting, which was to wind up the business of the Congress, was held at the Institution, under the presidency of Lord Brougham. There were also present Lord J. Russell, Sir J. Pakington, Mr. Cowper, M.P., Sir B. Brodie, Mr. Slaney, M.P., -Mr. Akroyd, MP., Mr. Gar. nett, M.P., Rev. Dr. Miller, Mr. A. Helps, Mr. W. C. Macready, Rev. Sydney Turner, the Mayor of Birming. ham, Dr. Livingstone, Mr. C. H. Bracebridge, the Recorder of Birmingham, Mr. Winfield, Dr. Conolly, Mr. Jellinger Symons, &c. The Rev. SYDNYy TuRNgi read the report of the General Committee, which recommended that the association should be constituted under its present name, with Lord Brougham as its president for the ensuing year, and a long list of vice-presidents and officers. Mr. G. W. Hastings was requested to aCt as the general secretary. The objecb of the association was stated to be to aid the developmuent of soolal scienec, and guide the publio mind to the best practical means of promoting the amendment of the law, the advancement of education, the prevention and repression of coime, the reformation of criminals, the adoption of sanitary regulations, and the diffosion of sound principles in all questions of social economy. On the motion of Mr. SLtxNY, seoonded by Mr. AxROYD, this report was adopted. The latter gentleman suggested that at future conferences an attempt should be made to enlist the co-operation In this movement of the intelligent portion of the working classest This proposition was received with genoral favour. A4 GRx'TLxaL. sugAgested that an engraving of the medal which had been struck to commemorate the inaugurs,tlon of the association should adorn the cover of the printed official report presently to bo issued. [On one side of this medal is a striking likenoss of the founder of the instution; on the other an appropriate insariptiono n Lord BRouuiaAss said he should have no objection to sea on the title page the side containing the inscription; but as to the reverse he could conceive nothing more contrary to all the rules of art and good taste than to perpetuate it. (Great laughter.) Mr. G. W. Hastings (secrotary) read the report from tho General Committee, which stated that upwards of 300 members had joined the association, and that 3W 10s. tickots h&d been sold. JURISPRUDENCE AND AMENDMENT OF THE LAW. The report from this department (Lord J. Russell, presldent) mentioned that 20 papers on -arious subjects had been read.

In this department thepapers communicated were dlvidcd into four groups :-Middle-class education, endowments fir educatlonal purposes, national education, and mlscellaneous. The department have received three valuable papers on Mliddle-class Education from Dr. Booth, Dr. Humnphrey, and Dr. Es-an Davis. No difference of opinion prevailed as to the importance of extending and improving thls great branch of national education, and an animated discussion ensued as to the constitution of a Board of Examiners for the miiddle schools, and to what extent the Universities, the Proceptors themselves, and other bodies, such as the Society of Arts, should be represented respectively in an educational tribunaL On the subject of endow. ments four papers were read by Dr. Humphrys, Mr. Thomas Keene, and Rev. J. D. CoUie, and a valuable discussion ensued. A strong feeling was expressed that our school endowments, including numerous smaU charities nowv nearly useless, which had been originally founded throughout the country for the benefit of the poor, should be applied for promoting the education of the working classes, but that no funds should be directed to this object which had been destined by their founders for non-educational purposes. It was also suggested that the funds provided for the education of the poorer classes woould become more extensively useful if the upper and middle classes were required to make suitable payment for their instruction at endowed schools origDinaly designed for that part of the commutity which is unable to pay for `ts education. A largo number of papers were read on National Education, and a long and animated discussion ensued, princ pally concerning the interference of labour with education and the practicability of introducing the Factory Act into the locality in which the association is now assembled. The fooling on the latter point was divided, some urging its impracticability, on account of the multifarious nature of the trades in Birmingham and the smal and numerous workshops in which artisans ere employed. A debate also arose n the question whether the remediy for the non-attendance of children at school after a certain age should ho applied by legislation or left to tho progress of social improvement and better appreciation of the advantages of mental discipeline. A paper on the Birmingham schools of King Edward's foundation by the Rev. W. Gifford excited great interest, especially in the fact pointed out that children of various religious denominations are beng educated without difficulty in the schools belonging to that foundation. But it was contended by some speakers that even in that school much may be thought to depend upon the judicious administration on the part of the head master. Miss Carpenter read an impressive Paper in reference to ragged schools, in which she urged the desirability of obtaining pcuniary aid from Government for those schools, as well as for other descriptions of elementary sehools and Professor PiUlans drew the attention of this swction to the inapplicability of the present Government system of aiding voluntary efforts to those districts in which the re- quired preliminary voluntary contribution cannot be raised. The last paper was by Mr. Seymour Tremenheere, explanatory of an important proposal to institute public periodical examinations for all boys upon finaly leaving the elementary schools. Several interesting miscellaneous papers were read, but in only one was a resolution arrived at. Mr. George Harris having read a communication on the manuscript treasures of the kingdom, it wvas resolved that the council be requested to consider the propriety of adopting measures for makiniz the valuable manuscripts of the country better knowrn and more generally useful. PFN-lSUMENT AND REFORIaATNO . In this department (presided over by Mr. MI. D. Hill, Recorder of Birmingham) 1 9 papers were read.

Symons, one of Her Majesty's Inispectors of Schools ; " On the Possible Extirpation of Regular Crime," by Ur. T. Barwick Baker: " On the Industrial Schools Aot, 1857," by gr. Alfred HilL WED1TESDAY, OCT.14. The President in the chair. Tho foUowing papers were read --" Hints on the Industrial Training of tbe Children of the Labouring Classes, and its Efficacy as a Means of Preventing Juvenile Cride," by Miss L. F.

The following paoers were read -" On Prison Punishments in County Prisons," by Dr. E. Smith; "On the Adaptation of Punishment to the Causes of Crime," by the Rev. J. T. Bnrt. A paper on " Punishment and -the Mark System," by Captain Maconorhie, was laid before the meeting and its object explained by the President, A paper " On the Reformatory and Refuge Union" was read by the Rev. H. J. Hatch. A statement was made " On the Objects and Operations of the National Reformatory Union," by Mr. G. W. Hastings. Papsrs were read "On the RCriminaltoSciety," by Mr. J. W. Wrey; and " On the Statistics of Birmingham Gaol," by the Rev. J. T. Burt. PUBLIC HEALTH. Lord Stanley, the president of this section, reported that 14 papers had been read, and that a considerable number remained yet to be disposed of. Under these circamstances it was not in his power to caUl on the section to make any report. Several of the papers appeared funl of valuable and interesting matter, and well deserred to be published in a permanent form. He suggested that a committee of selection should be appointed for this purpose. SOCIAL XCONO0Y. Lord Brougham presided in thts section. and the papers read were 22 in number. A communication by Mr. E. A)rroyd. bLP., "'on the Relations of Employer and Employed," was followod by a spirited discu5sion, and in the views entertained by the writer the majority of the speakers concurred. The voluntary inspectlon of workbouses by ldes, as suggested in a paper read by Miss Twining, seemed to be generaUy approved. In the disoussion which followed the reading of two papers on railway accidents (one by the president) Lord Brougham's suggestion to plmac a limit on the mxismum speed as a remedy received bat little support. Three paperm on the employment of women excited groat attention. Amid the varieties of opinion expresseo on the subject it was almost unanimously held that the employreon' of marrled women in manufactories produced an extremely prejudicial effect on their families. AU the speakers agreed In deploring the ignorance of domestic duties on the part of the women and girls employed In man&factorles, and the moral evils arising therefrom. Mr. Bracebridge's plan for the constraction of labourers' cottes was very generally approved. Mr. Stenthalls paper on intemperance was warmly discussed, hut the principle Of the Maine Liquor Law was not generally approved. Some of the speakers suggested that the evils of in temperance should form a specialbranch of school edutcation. The ntmost interest was excited by Mr. Acton's paper on prostitution, and a very animated and earnest discussiot ensued. All the speakers agreed as to the necessity fer a full and fearless investigation of the subject in all its bearin ge. advantages of the early closing movement, as advocated by Mr. Lilwall, was generally assented to, and various instances were adduoed of its successful adoption and the advantages resulting therefrom. The usefulness of self-supportng dispensaries, advocated in the paper of Mr. C. 1. Bracebridge, were unani. mously assented to. The G-neral Committee. in conclusion, recommended that a Printing Committee be immediately appointed to draw up and pbolish a selection of the papers and a report of the meeting. Mr. CorPxER, M.P., observed that among assemblagm of Englishmen there was generally some danger lest tho practical object in view shouildevaporate in mere compliment and spirited eloquence. As yet the association had beera free from any defect of that kind. During the last three dys a vast amount of business had been gone tbrough with earnest diligeneo and close attention, and almost every subject which could' be treated with advantage by men seeoing to improve the sochil condition of the ountry had been considered and debated. Perhaps,however, discussion had been too mush compressed; papers had been read which could not be fnUy discussed; and therefore he thought that at any future meeting they should either limit the number of papers, or else extend the period for delibeation, (E[ear, hear.) They effected in these meetings a union between men of thought and men of action, the maia result of which he believed would be to ascertain clearly the facts that ought to serve as the bases for future action. Altoge'her this congress had been a very decided success, and he cordialy moved the adoption of the report just read. Sir B. BRODIx seconded the motion. For himself, during the last few days he had not only acquired much information, but, he confessed, had found that some of his opinions on certain subjects were erroneous. It had been said that the association could be productive of no practical benefit. Now, it was true they could not legislate, but they could effect much by communicating knowledge and disseminating information. They must not be disappointed if they did no; do all the good which some sanguine persons expected from the association; but, although they who sowed the seed might not reap the harvest, the good, if it were not pro. duced now, would assuredly show itself hereafter. Lord BRouoniAai, in allusion to what had been said as to the inadequate period which could be devoted to discussion in the vanous sections, said there was some consolation in thinking what very good and satisfactory discussions might take place in a very short time. In the educational section the president (Sir J. Pakington) allowed an hour for discussion, restricting the speakers to five minutes, and had seldom had occasion to remind a speaker that he was oxceeding the statutory period. (A laugh.) So far from doteriorating the quality of the discussions, the right hon. gentleman was of opinion that for the sake of the subject, as well as of the audience this restriction was most valuable. and the conciseness imposed on each speaker was attended with no want of Information on subjects brought fprward. The Rev. Mr. BULL (of Birmingham) observed that Sir Jobn Paldngton'e own five minutes was nearly half-an-hour. (Laughter.) Lord BRorvmum.-But the Sovereign is above the law. (Renewed laughter.) A Mliranmt observed that Sir John's speech did not form part of the discussion. It was a summing up. (HleSr, ear.) Sir J. PALSGTON said that the five minutes' limit had been decided on by a majority of the members present in bis section, and he had been extremely struck by the result of what ho thonght atifirst was a doubtful experiment. There was only a slngle deviation from the rule laid down, and in that CAse an able speaker bad occupied but three minutes, and said he would give the remaining two minutes to somebody else, which he accordingly did. In all the other cases therestriction was observed. When a speech had reached the limit assigned to it up went his watch and. down went the speaker. (Laughter.) The resolution for the adoption of the report was therL agreed to. On the motion of Lord J. J. us L the secretary and two other gentlemen were appointed a committee on the subject of Bankruptcy Law Amendment, In accordance with the report gromn the section on Jurisprudence. Lord 3. RCssrEIL also proposed:- " That tbh warmest thanks os the eoittee be sftren to rorl Boughamk for his invaluable servioce a p-eedent, and fSo acowpt; tbe same offisc for the ensuing rear." Ile should not offend agalnst the five minutes' rule hn the remarks he was about to make, for he was sure that five seconds would be quite sufficient to induce those present to accede to this motion. He would only say that he did not believe there was another man in the united kingdom who would so admirably- Lord BR0OGunAlN (interrupting)-We have a rule in the Law Amendment Society that no eulogium shall be passed on the chairman. (Laughter.) We never allow that rule to be infringed, and I remember once actually, to his great discontent, stopping the Lord Mayor of London (Alderman Salomons) when he was commencing a panegyrlc on the president of one of our meetings. The Lord Mayor of London was stopped and obliged to take his seat, as I hopo my noble friend will now be. (Renewed laughter.) Lord J. RussxLL.-What has been said by the prnsident certainly very much cuts short my speech; but I wiU now refrain from all panegyrio [Lord Brongham.-I am open to any attacks you like to make, remember.] (laughter), nor, waving that privilege, wUll I indulge in any vitoperatbon or invective against the president. (,aughter.) I may be permitted, however, I suppose, to say something in favour of the association, which has neither the faults of n corporation nor is subject to the errors of an individual. One happy result of this association is that it brings together for the purpose of cooperation men who, rangod on opposite sides of the House of Commons, find co-operation there mnuch more difficult. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend (U he will allow me to caU him so) and I have found it much more easy to cooperate here than when we are drawn up in opposite ranks, which are apt to entertain the gravest, and, I believe, often themost unfounded suspicions of each otler. (Hear, hear.) When, however, meeting here we can talk the matter over we can then act in perfeot unison. I am not allowed to say that we have a president who can unite us in that way; it would be quite out of order if I were to add that the qual.- tLes of the individual chosen to preside were of great imnportanee for the accomplishment of this purpose, santhat in.

LOfDOV, SA2UBDAY, OCTOBBR 17,1857. Deep in the provinces, some 200 miles from London, in that vast temple of toil in which the pillars are a thousand tall chimneys, or " stalks," as they are there called, and the roof perpetual smoke, there has been exhibited this year such a collection of pictures, sculpture, and works or " treasures" of art of all ages as, with all its deficiencies, was never seen before. It is true that for certain schools of painting, or certain kinds of work, one might have gone with more advantage to the Vatican, to Florence, to the Louvre, to the " Green Vaultb" of Dresden, to Madrid, to Amsterdam, to Antwerp, or other places. Bat were a man driven to the dire necessity of making his choice, for good and for all, among all these collections he would probably have consulted a refined catholic taste by resting on the Exhibition of Art I Treasures at Manchester. All the arts, all the schools, new and old, were there, though the powerful geMius 1oi sho0wed itself in a large predominance of the new. In the eyes of most Englishmen, and we believe, too, of many foreigners, this has been the great charm and success of the Exhibition, for in a fair field and no favour modern art has proved itself no unequal competitor with old, and E:ngland hasheld her own against all the world. A comparison, however, with great galleries, the accumulated labour of a dynasty of kings, a dozen conquerors, several bloody revolutions, or a succession of Popes, is hardly a fair one. This was only a temporary collection, a summer's cloud, created by one happy suggestion, and existing only by a brie. monthly tenure. We should compare it with equallytransient shows. No doubt, it was a thing of a higher and finer class than the Exhibition in Hyde Park, which was eminently and almost exclusively industrial, the contents being material, raw, or in various stages of manufacture. If sculpture was adnitted, it was to adorn the long avenue of the nave, choice exotics and other plants being allowed on a like pretence. These exceptions only proved the mainly commercial character of that colossal show-room. The nobler part haa fallen to Manchester. Perhaps that is as it should be. The epigram-that is, one of the two epigrams on the subject-says that GzoBton I. sent a troop of horse to Oxford and a present of books to Cambridge, to supply the respective deficiencies of the two Universities London may have specially needed an industrial stimulus, and Manchester more knowledge of high art. The one is the metropolis of the southern, eastern, western, and midland counties; the other almost claims to be the capital of the vigorous, energetic, enterprising north. So the north and the south have in this instance lent one another what they wanted most. The success, measured by pecuniary results, has followed the rule of the collection, not the locality. Industry received miUions of visitors, and raised an immense surplus of money in Hyde Park; genius has proved a bad speculation even at Manchester. We cannot grudge Manchester the pleasure and the distinction it has gained. We grudge nobody what they have come by honestly merely by taking a step in advance, or stretching a ionger arm thaa other people. London broke ground first. It played the firat card, as some people would say, or had the first shot in the duel. Its idea was an Industrial Exhibition. That one wish fulfilled, thewishing power was exhausted, and London had to sit stil, waiting till the worldwould tolerate a second freak of the kind from her. But, while we were all waiting, Manchester stepped in, fresh and free, to have her wish in her tum. Under good advice she wished better and wiser than we did in the south. Such is the way in which great cities play with great stakes against one another, and it would take a very long head indeed to master the game. However, the idea once started, it was found that such a vein had never yet been opened. From almost every gallery, every cabinet, every notable mansion in this country, the choicest contributions were lavished on the great cotton city, and there was scarce a nobleman who did not think himself honoured by having his most precious pictures carted away by strange hands from his own dry sunny walls to the wooden partitions of a great leaky shed at Manchester. There never was such a collection; there never will be another such in our time. The occasion is exhausted. It is a plant that flowers but once In a century. Could it have been foreseen, how we should have fought for it! How everybody south of the Trent would have declaimed against the intolerable impudence and presumption of the calico people expecting to have the great show of the world's arts at their dingy, dirty city; presenting themselves at the mansions of the aristocracy, armed with the threat of public opinion, and demanding the loan of the finest pictures, the most precious or the most curious gems! However, this was done too quick for anticipation, or'prevention, or discussion; and there were but few people in this island who had not to hear of It when settled, and to accept it as an accomplished fact. We can only say the.t Mauchester deserves it, if only for the promptitude and spirit displayed. None but the brave deserve the, fair, and the more audacious the scheme the more meritorious in our eyes ; no doubt, too, in the eyes of the citizens of Manchester. Yet, in sober truth, and on an impartial consideration of the working and results, it is scarcely short of a misfortune that so great an affair should not have been in the Metropolis, instead of the distant province. The famous visit of the Olympian Deities to Ethiopia, whicn produced so much inconvenience in the more civilized region of Troy, was not so extraordinary a proceeding as a general migration of the Muses to Manchester. All Greece, says the poet, poured into Italy to do honour to AuGuaTus; but then Greece on the banks of the Tiber was much more accesible to the greater part of Europe than on its natural soil; and people had to come to Rome for other reasons besides the study of high art. They had to come for office and employment; for trade and for roguery; to plead for their kingdoms, their estates, their lives,-for everything that depended on the will of the conqueror. But Manchester is still Ianchester, and wil so remain for many a long day. To say nothing of the eternal canopy of smoke which hangs over the whole region for miles round, in comparison with which the atmosphere of London is cleamess itself, it is subject to the most violent tempests of rain which are known in this country, and against which so frail and ephemeral a building as that of the Exhibition could afford no adequate protection. Of this we fear that some of the exhibitors will bring back with them abundant evidence. This is, moreover, a question of convenience, of greater or less convenience, of the convenience of the many or of the few; and as such the decision must have been in our favour. They who have otber ordinaVr reasons for visiting the Metropolis are many times more numerous than the businessgoing visitors of Manchester. Everybody has friends in London; happy the man who had a friend even within a dozen miles of Manche,ter. So, while everybody could combine business, pleasure-hunting, friend-hunting, public amusements, and sights of all kinds enough to fill a fortnight, and pay for a journey of 400 miles out and home to the Metropolis, the only thing a southern family could combine -with a visit to the Manchester Exhibition was a round of the factories,-with good introductions,-a visit to Liverpool, the Lakes, or North Wales. The result has been that many thousands who would have appreciated the Exhibition, and were the very people to turn it to account, have been unable to go there. They could not spare a week and the expense of a good long holyday. Others have gone, and returned only to regret the lit le use they could make of it. They did it in three days,-it took three, at the least, we have heard it said by people, *with all their youthful wits and senses unimpaired and fresh, to do common justice to the Exhibition. Even they confessed that they sat down at the end of each long day thQreQughIly j adoed withx the labouir of looking at th pictures alone, putting aside the china, ivories, prints, mnetalwork, and countlem other curiosities with which the building was stored. We must say that, though numbers and magnitude have advantages of their own, in the way of Mat, and in the general impression made upon the mind, yet, for all purposes of instruction-that is, as a school of art-this Exhibition has been much over done. Seven thousand separate pictures and works of art, every one really requiring a careful and leisurely contemplation to bring out its beauties, were too much to be turned to any profitable account. Let anybody just consider what it is to go to the smaller annual exhibitions in Pall-mall -viz., that of the works of Ancient AMasters and jDeceesed British Painters-and he will have some measure of the quantity of which the |mind is capable. It is a very good day's work to study and to enjoy the two hundred pictures in that quiet, comfortable galery, where you may not see fifty people in a summer's day, and may recognize among them three or four old friends. iMoat people in London who can afford it go I three or four times to the loyal Academy; and in all discussions as to the site of the National GaUlery it is assumed that anybody who cares for pictures will often drop in and enjoy his favourites. Then, what a time did it take to go fairly through the SOULAGES Collection, and hovr tired one was ! The calm, tranquil, soothing Watercolours, with the additional comfort of chairs and settees, take the heart and strength out of an afternoon. But the Manchester Exhibition was ten times all these put together. It would take a hundred days to study it or enjoy it at the rate we have supposed necesaary in the metropolitan exhibitions. That rate we believe to be a fixed and necessary one. The most practised eye, the most ardent love of art, the keenest intelligence cannot really take In more than fifty pictures a-day. By that time the eyes and the brain are used up, and refuse to record or receive any more impressions, It is time then to sleep, to dream, to walk, or talk upon them; but there must be an interval before another meal. The Manchester Exhibition has been in violation of al these rules, all these facts, we should say ; for they are laws of human nature, and cannot be helped. We conclude, then, that this is an exaggeration not to be repeated. No doubt, it has done great good in its way, as a great spectacle of art, a review of al schools, a well-marshalled procession of pictures and sculpture of aU countries and times; but for instruction suited to every day life, as well as for pleasure, we prefer our own modest metropolitan annuals.
It is sometimes asked what is the cheapest article of modern consumption, and it is rather hard to answer the question. People used to say, " At " the price of an old song " but old songs must have risen, for twenty or thirty pounds are sometimes given for one. Then there is the saying " Cheap as dirt." But that depends, inasmuch as dirt, where you want 't, is not at aU cheap. For example, we pay the Peruvian Government near half a milion a-year for dirt. Then air is cheap, but not pure air; and water is cheap, that is in the Thames or the oceau. The collector tells you that gas is the cheapest of luxuries, but he forgets that besides burning his carburetted hydrogen we occasionally breathe it also, and so pay in lungs as weU as in pocket. Good advice is said to be cheap. So it is, and that is corming very near our answer. The cheapest thing going we believe to be Hlumanity. Of course, however, that means at the place and time of production. Humanity, where there is a run cn the article, may cost you very dear, as, for exaanple, when you let a robber go, and he pays you by breaking your head. At the manufactory it is cheap enough, and the manufactory of the article is, in this country, a snug library, an easy chair, a warm fire, a general attention to personal wants, and an equal absence of unpleasant interruptions. When the blood is 'flowing freely right to one's fingers and toes, and a pleasing current of thought begins to trickle through one's brain, hiunanity exudes as fast as gutta percha or maple juice from their sreveral trees. Following the universal law of nature, the generous liquid avoids obstacles, gravitates where it can, and finds its leveL For example, your humanity does not wear itself away in vain attempts to keep your temper with a ridiculous wife, to bear a crosagrained or prosy old relative, to teach your children their lessons or their duties, or to jog on comfortably with your neighbours. Humanity, li-e all else that is really noble, prefers a lofty flight and affects a grand scale. It scatters blessings in a nation's eyes. It dispenses peace and plenty, happiness and virtue; and very early discounts the immense returns of gratitude which are sure to flow in. But how much easier to forgive a hundred million men for murdering a million or two of their neighbours than to forget the unpleasant remarks which Mr. So-and-so has made on your rustic gait, your provincial accent, your homely manners, your hangdog look, or your general want of good presence and manners. If a hundred philanthropists make one saint, and a hundred saints one angel, it would take at least a hundred angels to make the man capable of overlooking injuries of this peculiarly infamous character. Indeed, it is evident no numerical proportion, no scale of actual wrong, applies to the case. Anybody can forgive the whole human race all the enormities it has ever committed, but few indeed can feel undiminished charity to tle Zm n] who persists in refusing to appreciate them. Such are the thoughts naturally suggested by two documents now lying before us. One of these must have been written not literally under the genial circumstances above described, but more probably under the refrigerating and soothing influence of punkahs, cold baths, ice-water, and other cooliDg draughts. It reaUy is a most amiable and beautiful document, and, were it found in the archives of an extinct race, or wrapped round the mumny of a PrLAROAn of the 147th dynasty, it would give a new and undying celebrity to the name of the Monarch or the Minister from whom it was found to have emanated. There is so much heart in the document -indeed, it is aU heart, for we cannot say we can find anything else in it. We presunae it must be called the " Clemency of CANNING," though it is our private belief that the suggestion, as well as the composition, is due rather to the other members of the Government. It is a series of resolutions of the most humane and considerate character, taken in Council, and proclaimed to the whole world, in the form of a letter to the civil authorities of the North-Western Provinces of Bengal. The humanity and consideration are for the sole benefit of the mutineers, for we must confess it quite passes our understanding to divine how it is to be carried out by the unfortLnate persons charged with the suppression of the mutiny. Their task is by no means an enviable one, at the very best. They generally die in the long run, and six weeks or so is a very long run for a General or a Staff officer to enjoy under present circumstauces. By cholera or sun-stroke, by mere and sheer exhaustion and misery, by one of our owvn rounl ehot, by one of our own greased cartridges, or by the treacherous hand of one of our own still remaining allies, iu three months we have already lost a whole galaxy of illistrious names, the bright relics of former wars, the supposed seed of future glory on Indian soil, It is not pleasant fQr a man who believes himself a CLIvE Or a WELLLNGTON to bave this eort of death always before him, and when the fearful oddcs against him make it almost a moral certainty. But his discomforts must be not a little aggravated when he receives, or rather reads in the public papers, read by a native as well as Feringhee, a proclamation putting him wbolly on the wrong side, stigmatizing all prompt and sumlnary justice as wanton inhumanity, and imposing a number of rules for the prosecution of humaTnity and the preservation of the Sepoy, which it would take fifty judges, fiftyjuries, and as many months at least to carry out, with the probability of a general failure of justice natural in the end. As a general rule-and this is the very last occasion on which the general rule should be broken-the suppression of a mutiny ought to be left to the untied hands of the military authorities. They must know not only what is best to be doDe, but what is the only thing that can possibly be done under the existing circumstances. War is generaUy a matter of necessity. The Commander has ten minutes to consider what to do in the next half-hour, with the most fearful issues, of which his own life is the mtallest part, depending on the decision. He cannot be nice at such a time. If he indulges in excemsive and malignant cruelty, let him be brought to court-martial, or visited with some mark of Royal displeasure, If he even err palpably, but not to so great an extent, public opinion will frown on him for the rest of his days. But the treatment of confessed offenders, of murderers, the accomplices, and the abettors, of plunderers, and marauders, must be left to his discretion. Of course, we shall be misunderstood, but we are happily in a position to defy wilfal misunderstanding, when we jurt point out that it is one thing to start from a principle, and the other to start from the fact; and that the latter is what the commanding officer in war not only ought to do, but must do, and always does. Take such a case as has occurred, in one place orsanother, at least once a day since the outbieak of this mutiny. Suppose the Brigadiet, having just with the greatest cifficulty beaten off ten times Eis own-number, and mastered a position. Ee is sick, utterly exhausted, expecting every moment to leave his corps in the hands of sowe officer whom he naturally does not think so able a one as himself. He has made his advance, er stood his ground, by mere audacity; he is in want of everything; he fights With a diminishing host against an increasing one. He had to fight a battle this morning, and Wil certainly have to fight another to-morrow morning,-perhaps to-night, perhaps in half an hour. He has hardly food for his men, hardly a gu;ard for his beggage, or cattle for his guns; but the fortqne of war has thrown into his hands a few score mutineers, who are found, possibly, withoub arms, in a town, or presenting themselves- for submission. Perhaps the whole village a few wree before turned out to rob and murder a party of fugitive offieers. What is he to do-immediately, without. five minutes' delay? Is he to let the vilage pas scot free,without a mark to show thab the tardy avenger has at length passed over the spot? Is he always to take the word of the rautineera that they had no hand in an actual murder, or that they had no heart in the affair, and only acted by compulsion? We may be- thought to have put an extreme case, be. few cases have yet occurred which did not demand decision, and one between very summary retribution or utter default. Everywhere and in every case there was an apprehension of further mutiny, or a reasonable expectation of having to stand an attack or make a retreat under great difficulty and with treachery all rown& But, in sober trath, the business before owr army in India is not to carry cut a scheme of justice or of humanity, but to put down a sanguinary and treacherous mutiny, and to &> so in such a way as shall prevent its early recurrence. Let this be done as justly and humanely as possible; but, in the fir,st place, it must be doe; and in comparison with that object justice and humanity are secondary considerations If burglars break into a man's house, his first busines is to destroy them. They have provoked the- colisn, and it is their own look-out. When they re fairly in custody it is time for judge and jury to discriminate between the shades of their guilt, and commute the death they deserve for a humane and remedial servitude. For our part, we shall only be too happy should the time arrive when these traitors may be safely set to railways, or works of irrigation, or deported to the West India Islands. This is simply impossile now. That, indeed, is the absurdity of this document. it is a gross anachronism. The writers forgot that all is not yet over in the Upper Provinces. The Court lord talked fine and snuffed his pouncet-box before HoTspuitas he lay exhausted after the battle. The Council talks humanity in the thixk of the war. The general voice at home, we are bound to say, takes a much more comprehensive view of the subject, and does much more justice to the unexampled difficulty of our overtaxed armies and Generals in India. After some of the stuff that has been talked on this subject we feel very grateful to Lord JORN Russzr for the manly and sensible tone of his remarks at Birmingham on Wednesday. Ilis Lordship is not ashamed to say that he feels on this occasion the same anxious hope that retribution may overtake- the perpetrators of these crimes as when a deed of horror at home awakens and baffles the indignation of the country. As he says truly, there is no vindictive spirit in this, unless it be sinful to sympathize and co-operate in a process which is declared to be a leading feature of Disr-zN PROVIDsNCZ, a special attribute of the A-iMraRTY, and half the work of the last Great Day. Let us discriminate as far as is possible; and Lord JoHN RUSSELL mentions a case-one of many we have a comfort in saying-which everybody will feel to be one for a merciful construction and a maciful dealing. But these cases are exceptions, and must be treated as such. The rule for all mautiny is death; much more for such a mutiny as tlhis so Unprowoked, so treacherous, and stained by such hideols crimes. We put this consideration irst and foremost. Let us discriminate with oppertunity and leisure, and be merciful when the danger is pa For the present British India, tbousands of Vecious lives, and the destinies of India itself, hang on tb question.
The arrival of the Indian journals, copious extracts from which we yesterday published, enables us to coUect the opinions of our countrymen in the East on the aspect of affais, vwhich they contemplate more closely, though not more earnestly, than ourselves. Both in Bombay and Calcutta the fortnight last elapsed was regarded as a period of inaction and suspenlse, but fratght necessarily witb greater advantages to the Governmnent than to the rebels. Nothing had been done at Dolhi, nothing further at Cawnpore; but Madras Nvas tranquil, Bombay under command, Lucknow re-provisioned, and the rebel army at Delbi disheartened by uniform failure and constant defeat. Perhaps the most important item inl the whole intelligence is that which relateto the continued qluiet of the Madras Presidency, and the assurances on this head become the more credible after the official notification, recentlv received, that the Government of the Niz.,j ha;l beoz acting with exemplary good faith, In Bombay the dimensions and configuration of tbeh Presidency enable the authorities to dispose of small forces with great effect, and, as troops were rapidly coming up, it was not probable that the ascendancy hitherto vigorously maintained by the Government would be in any degree impaired. It is gratifying also to ob,erve that the main body of the army still professes and exhibits unshaken loyalty, but we fear that the Bombay Sepoys can no longer be cons dered as exempt by their discipline or extraction from the delusions to which the Bengal regiments -were exposed. In the province of Rajpootana, whers Bombay troops are now quartered, they have manifested a spirit of revolt on three several occasions, and, though their insubordination did not ill any instance present the fouler features of Bengal mutinies-and much, no doubt, is to be ascribed to the unusual temptations of their position-it is obvious that in these, as weU as other native levies, the materials of dicaffection and treachery must be supposed to exist. It was probably for the sake of controlling the agitation discernible in these parts that the 89th IRegiment, recently arrived at Bombay from the Cape, had been pushed up to Deesa. The operations undertaken from Cawnpore and directed primarily to the relief of Lucknow were gradually acquiring very considerable magnitude. The original force under General HAvznocs:'s command, with which he accomplished his victorious advance from Allahabad to Bithoor. comprised portions of four European regiments-the 64th, the 78th, the 84th, and the 1st Maadras Fusileers. To the assistance of these General OUTRAm was now leading the oth and the 90th, and it is not to be forgotten that when Lucknow has been relieved its garrison of 500 or 600 soldiers of the 32d wll be disengaged and disposable. The aggregate of this force would present, therefore, between 3,000 ancd 4,000 British troops, besides a considerable body of Sikh and Ghoorka auxliaries; and we are told that Sir COLLN CAPSBLr, woulcd probably join this division after its work had ben done in Oude, and take it on to Delhi. With the united armies of Delhi and Cawnpore under the command of a vigorous and determined leader it does not seem reasonable to expect much successful opposition on the part of the enemy. General HAvEoceK's proceedings at Cawnpore hava sufflced to dispel aU apprehensions entertained about the safety of his column. It was feared that after retiring to this city he might be surrounded by countless bands of insurgents, and reduced to the same perils which had beset the former unhappy garrison. The energies, however, of his little band were not paralyzed by the presence of helpless women and children, and although he was soon, indeed, encomapassed by swarms of mutineers, he established the superiority of his strength by marching out a second time against their most formidable position at Bithoor and returning in triumph to Cawnpore after his ninth victory in the field. The interest attaching to these operations from the perils of Luclnow and the extraordinary valour shown in the efforts for its relief has almost obscured the important but less absorbing incidents of the siege of Delhi. It deserves, however, to be remarked tthat General Wmisox's tactics have been signalized by the best results. Assuming that ottr true policy in tbis position was to maintain the ascendancy until reinforeements arrived, and to inflict the greatest amount of damage on the enemy with the least possible loss to ourselves, it cannot be denied that these objects have been most successfully attained. Our casualties have been very fevw in number; the health of the camp has been excellent, and. the mutineers have encountered complete discomfiture in every operation they have undertaken. What may be the state of things within the waUs of the city is matter for conjecture alone, but the rebels certainly appear on many occasions to be respectably commanded. The regiments have lost all but their native offieers, and tbese, being indebted for their promotion. to seniority alone, are, we awe assured, almost, uniformly incapable and effete. Yet, in some way or other, the Sepoys usually seem to be weU handled. That the defects of the Asiatic soldier are visible enough in the actual conflict, that the mutineerm rarely venture upon close combat, and are invariably scared by the appearanee of European troops, we hear on al sides-in fact, it is declared that the Sepoys, as regards personal courage, show no stomach for fighting at all. Yet their ofensive and defensive operations appear, upon the whole, to be skilfully conducted. Their batteries are judiciously placed, well armed, anl by no means badly work-ed. They detect the most advantageous points of attackl, and seem seldom to overlook any opportunity. At fist they endeavoured to expose our rear by gaining the bridges over the streams which defend it; foiled in this attempt, they strove to wear us oat by a series of Incessant assaults; they then marched out of the city to intercept the siege train, and when they discovered that a detachment had left the camp toprotect the convoy they made an attack upon our position at what they inferred would be a moment of weakness. In some instances, too, their formations and manceuvres have been spoken of with decided approbation. There is one particular feature about these deplorable nmutinies which receives fresh illus-ration by every successive mail, and which is more mysterious and incomprehensible than almost any other. Bodies of men mutiny without any prsetical object, and without the slightest prospecfr of successful insurrection. They remain faithful, or at least unmoved, during periods of the greatest temptation, and then revolt, as at Dinapore, when the crisis seems to have passed. At Lahore a regiment, and that one declared by Lord ELLmUNBOROUGH the best in the service, actiaUy mutinied after having lost its arms, and the Sepoys, after murdering their commanding officer, fled into a country where every village was their enenmy, and where it was certain that the forces of the Government would overtake and crush them. It is useless, of course, to loolt for consistency or reason in the manifestations of a panic essentially irrational, but it is hardi to inder- stand howr an i-Plse which proves irresistible at last could have been withitohd at filrt. This, however, is only one among the many considerations which tell so decisively against the policy of maintaining a d.mninant Sepoy force. No Government can poesibly be secure when a preponderance of military power is vested in an army every soldier of which is inavitably liable to visitations of frenzy. Colonel SvEZs arguted the other day that the high-casi* Hindoo ought not to be singled out for opprobrium on account of his prejudices, seing thak both Jewvs andChristianshadtheir own alimentary observances. But Jewa do not become iad from error lest somebody should drive them to touch pork; nor woould any Pdpist, however rigid in his notions, conceive that an involuntary broac& of any prescribed abstinence would destroy h14) in this wvorld and the next. The dangerons elemrnt in the Sepoy character arises, * ot from his prejuadies, but from the spirit in which those prejudices are regarded. A mau may object to taste cow feshi and( yet mal;e a good soldier; but if he is perpv tually liable to the persuasion that his rilers wish to force beef dowin his throat, and withx that impression is ready to go to any length in mutiny and murder, he certainly is not an eligible recrtuit. The native populations of India may ccntinue, we hope, as heretofore, to reader
LATEST INTELLIGENCE. (BY 8U &RXA BEMSH ThLZGRAyH.) SPAIN. We have received the following telegram from -ur Pari correspondent:- "PARIS, FRIDAY EVMZNc-G, OCT. 16, 7 P.ii.

The New York Courier and Bnrquirer of the 1st aays,- " The community received with muoh satiwfaction the announcement that the banks in convention yesterday bad -concluded to extend their loans 3 per cent. upon the pre. sent aggregate. A similar move is annaounced at ros. ton to the amount of 10 per cent. upon their capital 4or $3,000,000). This is the amount of curtallment for the past four weeks, the aggregate being now nearly j0,O0,000 against S53,000,0M0 on the 25th of August. So far as New York is concerned, the proposed increase can be made with perfect safety, and that policy can be safely 3maintained nntil a check occurs in the shape of unfavourable foreign exchanges. But while the rates are under 9: per .cent. there is no occasion to fear a reveal of the specie. The redomption of umcurrentmonay goes on with uniformity and ease. There is no fu rther discredit of the banks of New England. A considerable accession of coin will be re. ported by the Black,-vi&, from Califoruia (probably), t1,S00,00 ; from the Sub-Treasury, for sales ofGovernment Sixes, $1,(00,000; from the interior towvn, $300,000. " Our correspondent at Washington reports an important decline in the Custom-house revenue for the quarter ending .this day. A reaction having taken place, the Treasury w be compelied to draw largely on existing funds in hand to neet the appropriation for the current fiscal year; the Custom-house duties will probabhly fall short sdx or eight alnlhions from the estimates furnished to Congress.

The N.ur York Jotvrnal of Cotmmerce states that 7ills on London were quoted as low as 95 per cent., and were, in fact, unsaleable. The same paper says:- " There is a better tone of feeling in the street, and a general determination to do all which courage can accom7plish towards inaugurating better times. The banks have .already commenced the expansion promised yesterday, and the faces of borrowers are visibly shortened." The failure of Butler, Keith, and Hill, of Boston, is announced. Swift, Brother, and Johnston's bank, of Chicago, had suspended temporarily. A despatch from Philadelphia says . "Thc Pennsylvania hank refuses for the p resent to come Into an arrangement with other banks, fearing that her targest depositors wrill remove their balances to other banks.

EXHIBITION OF ARTS TBSBASURBS. MAN'}CH1STER, Ocr. 16. The total number of visitors to the Exhibition yesterday was upwards of 14,000, of which nearly 30,000 were admissions by payment, so that, financiaUy considered, the reelt of the day was most satisfactory. A few minutes before the time appointed for dlosing last night a slight disturbance was cau,ed by the insolent and extortionate conduct of one of the waiters in the firstclass refrerhment room. The conduct of these men in the matter of charges had been marked by excessive rapacity throughout the day, and appeared 1to give general dissatisfaction. One fellow, who had particularly distinguished himself by monstrous levies, and had assaulted a man appointed to nail up the tariff of prices in order to protect the public from impositioD, arried off by the police, and another ejected from the building for using insolent and abusive language. Extra precautions have been taken to-day to prevent the recurrence of any similar annoyanee and to put a stop to the cauges which gave rise to it. The disturbance, such as it -was, has been maguified by the local jouinals here into a planned emeute among the waiters, and amid such terms as "s erious injuries," " desperate attack,"&c., one almost faUls to recognize that the whole affair was comprised into handing over an insolent vagabond to the custody of the police, after much the same fashion as wouild have been adopted with a more open pickpocket. The -charges of the waiters in the first-class refreshment room have, however, latterly been a source of deep annoyance to both the visitors and the members of the Executive Committee; but it is hoped that the punishment of one of them, who was this morniing committed to take his trial at the sessions, will have a wholesome influence upon the conduct of the rest. At all events, up to 3 o'clock to-day no fresh causes of complaint had arisen. Up to the same hour, also, the total numnber of vistors execeded 10,000, of 'which number 5,200 were admissions by payment, making the receipts amount to nearly 7001. The first aecident which has occurred to any of the innumerable costly articles confided to the care of the Executive Comnittee was on Tuesday last, when, owing to the excessive pressure of the crowd while leaving, a amall vase of Oriental porcelain belonging to the Duke of Manchester was thrown down and a piece broken out. It has been mended with such skill that the injury is more nominal than real, for even a close inspection fails to detect the fracture. The hope is still expressed in Manchester that the :Executive Committee may be induced to grant ano-thor day's exhibition in aid of the Indian Relief T'und, but "the wishl is father to the thought," .and the (lay of closing is fixed beyond all hope of wev-cation.

LORD BLLBNBOROUGH ON INDIA. The following address to the members of the Winchcomb Agricultural Association has been published by Lord Ellenborough:- "SOUTRAM DELABERE, OCr.T 16. Gentlemen,-I much regret my not baing able toattend your annual meeting to-day, the more especially as I was desirous of speaking to you uporn the subject nearest to my heart-the war in India, and of urging you to assist, as you and all countrt gentlemen and farmers can most powerfully, In bringing the country through the difficulties in which it is involved. " Not haviDg the opportunity of addressing you otherwise, I now write to you. "As to the war itself I need say but little, As to the conduct of the blinisters and of the Indian Government in this emergency I shaU say nothing. I must soon have ample and more proper opportunities of saying whatever I may think upon that subject. "Gentlemen,-You may not havo looked into all the details of what has taken place in India, but you mus know this-that we have there a great war forced upon us by rebels who sould deprive all our countrymen of their lives and England of an empire-that where we placed our confidence we have been met with treachery-where we acted with kindness we have encountered murder-murder, not direct-ed only against men by whom redstance might be made, and from whom wrongs might have been feared, but extending equally to unoffending, helrI. less women-to the children at their knees, and to the infants at their breasts-sparing none, and often inflicting death with torture upon the body where it had aleady | more cruelly tortured the mind. "We have seen there, in almost every instance of mnutiny, one general deliberate design, not only to deprive us of the dominion we bave so long held with honour, but to place us, as a people, under circumstances of outrage and of indignity, whic h, if we submit to them, must render us in the qyes of All living men and of all future generations a despised and degraded race. Will you submit to this? You vrWill say you never will-you will have redress and vengeance. We will say nothing about vengeance; that belongs only to a higher Power; but to punish crime so signally as to deter all hereafter from its commission, and to vindicate our sovereign authority, this is no doubt our right and it is our duty-and you will say you will not be found wanting lx the performance of it. But then what wi you do? Depend upon it, it is not enough to sit quietly at home and to pay taxes, nor to go to public meetings and pass resolutions expressive of sympathy with the sufferers and of indignation against their destroyers. You must do more than this, and I will tell you what you can do, what none but those who are in your position can do equally well, and what you now all ought to do for the honour of the country and for your own. "You have heard of the great reinforcements of troops which have been recently sent or are now going out to India. You have been assured that we shall have there a larger army than we had in the Crimea, and I dare say you expect from the exertions of this force early and complete success in the war. Everything that the noblest of soldiers can do has been done, and will be done, by ours in India; and they have now a General who knows well wrhat war is- the lions are at lst led by a lion-but be assured that this is not a sudden temporary danger to be repelled by sudden temporary exertion. What at first was a mutiny is become a revolution; to restore civil authority is more dlfficult than to repress mi3itary resist. ance, and it requires more force to occupy than It does to subdue. Be assured that the military institutions of this country, managed as they are now, are insufficient perma. nently to supply the number of men required to re. conquer what we have lost, and to hold our Empire here. after in security. It is only through a change in those institutions, which no Minister would willingly propose, or throngh a great practical improvement in the working of them, which your cooperation may supply, that the necessary force can be maintained. I am satisfied that the principle upon which our -Militia Is now founded, that of voluntary enlistment, Is the one most acceptable to the people; and I feel assured that a Militia maintained at its full complement, as it may be, and can only be, by the patriotic exertions of country gentlemen and farmers, is the beat foundation of our military system. If you, and such as you, will by your efforts keep the Militia up to its complement, the regular army will take care of itself. It may cost more to draw the recruit for the army through the Militia, but the recruit so obtained Is in most cases one who would not have boen procared at aU unless he had first entered the Militia and there acquired a taste for military service. Employ in the obtaining of recruits for the Mlitia but half the zeal you would display in getting votes at an election and you will certainly succeed. A hundred recruiting sergeants could not do what each of you can do within thesphere of his per. sonal influence. " When I tell you that you have this power I speak from my own experience. When the Militia as now constituted was first established in 1853, I took much Interest in the success of the measure, and I carnestly requested sevetal farmers I was acquainted rith to do their utmost to obtain recruits. Some zealously exerted themselves, others were more lukewarm; but in every instance in whioh an irn'duential farmer cordiaUly undertook the duty the result was uniformly the same; and I am convinced that If all who could have done so had acted as some did the country could in that year have raised, not between 50,000 and 60,000, bub not less than 120,00) men. " No doubt, you would be greatly aided In your exertions to obtain recruits if the Militia of the county should be embodied. Men will more willingly enlist in a regiment theY can see marching with all the pomp and circumtstance of war than in a corps 'which remains invisible, and of which 'he existence 1s only to be found in official records. But, let others do as they may, it isforyouto do your duty. Where you lead otbers will follow, and while you do much good by your individual efforts you will do yet muore by your example. "I ask you only to do ;wbat I know you can do and what I feel you ought to do for the assistance of the country in this critical juiicture of our affairs, " It is impossible to over-estimate Its importance. There is nothing man holds dear for which we have not now to fight. If we should not bear ourselves manfully in the contest thus forced upon us, if we should not succeed in it, we must be content, not only to lose the noblest empire in the world, but to make the name of Englishmen a byword of shame '-monsc nationu " The wives and daughters of our countrymen have been publicly violated, their children have been put to death with circumstances of cruelty surpassing all we read of in history as the pnnishments inflicted by God upon the offending Jews. It has not been deemed suficlent to destroy us. We were first to be dishonoured, and this in a country through whioh we have prondly-peshaps too proudly-stalled as conquerors for 100 years. " Do you suppose that, if we could submit to this in India we should not be threatened with it in England. Do you imagine that the great military Powers of Ecope, always prepared for war, offended by our pride, resentful of our former victories, and coveting our present wealth, would long permit us to onjoy in peace the luxuries we cling to and the dreams of irresistible strength in which we fatuously indulge? Be assured that if, under the strougest necessity ever imposed upon a people, we do not rise as one man to vindicate our national honour and to re-establish our Indian empire the horrors we read of with shsddering as perpetrated at Meerut and at Delhi will not for ever be averted from our island home. " I counsel you, therefore, to give at once your cordial assistance, as you best can give It, to the couDtry. In the prosecution of this contest which we cannot avoid-thc greatest and the most diffioult in whicb we have ever been en2aged-it wrill not do to confine ourselves to a cold corn. phi8nco with what may be required from us by the laN.

THE INDIAN MUTINIBS. The following is Mr. Beadon's letter addres_ed to the Government Secretary on the North-Western Provinces, encloeing an extract from the proceedings of the Governor-General in Council- "To C. B. Thornhill, Bsq., Officiating Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces. "Sir,-I am directed to forward the accompanying ex tract from the proceedings of the light Hon. the Governor. General in Council, relative to the treatment of mutineers, deserters, and other persons concerned in the recent and present disturbances, and to request that the observanoe of the principles there laid down may be enjoined upon the local authorities. "I have, &c, 'C. BEADON, "Secretary to the Government of India. "Fort William, July 31." " No. 1,359. "Extract from the proceedings of the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India in Conncil in the Homo Department, under date the 31st of July, 1857. " Resolution. "1. The Governor-General ef India in Council has obEerved with approbation the zealous exertions of the local civil authorities for the apprehension and condign punish. ment of the mutineers and deserters concerned in the present revolt. It was necessary by the severe and prompt punishment of such of these crminals as found their way in the districts in eour possession where the minds of the native troops could not but be in a very unsettled state, though the men for the most part had abstained from open mutiny, to show that the just fate of the mutineer is death, aud that the British Government was powerful to inflict the penalty. It was necessary also by the offer of rewards for the apprehensios of all de;erters to check the crime of desertion whioh waa becoming rife in some of these regiments, and to prevent the possible escape of mnen who, apparently mere deserters, had been concerned In such terrible atrocities that their apprehension and condign punishment was an imperative duty. "2. But lest measures of extrece severity ahould be too hastily resorted to, or carried too far, his Lordship in Council thinks it right to issue detailed instructions on this sub. ject by which all Civi officers will be guided in the exercise of their powers in the cases of mutineers, deserters, and rebels. " 3. There is reason to belleve that in some even of those native regiments -whose revolt has been stained by the most eanguinary atrocities some men may have distinguished themselves from the mass by protecting an officer. In some such cases men of very guilty regiments possess certificates in their favour from officers of their regiments; but there may be others equally deserving of clemency who xre with. out any such ready means of clearlng themselves from the presumptive evidence of their deep guilt. " a. Where the number of men gullty of what it is im. possible to pardon Is so great the Government will gladly seize every opportunity of reducing the work of retribution before it by giving a frce pardon to all who can show that they have a claim to mercy on this ground, provided they have not been guilty of any heinous crime against person or property, or aided or abetted others in the commission any sueb crime. "- 5. It is undertood that in regiments which mutinled, and for the most part went over to the rebels, without murdering their officers or committing any other sanguinary outrage, there were men who appeared to have had no heart n the revolt, though they failed in their duty as soldiers, and who have evinced their peaceable disposition and their want of sympathy with those who are now arned in open rebollion against the Government by dispersing to their villages when the regiment broke up, and mixing quietly with the rural population. It is desirable to treat such men with all reasonable leniency. " 6. The Governor-General in Council therefore deems it necessary to lay down the foUowing rules for the guidance of civil authorities in exercising the powers vested in them by recent legislation for the punishment of native officers and soldiers charged with mutiny or desertion:- "No native offlcer or soldier belonging to a regiment which has not mutinied is to be punished by the civil power as a mere deserter, unless he be found or apprehended with arms in his possession. Such men when taken before or apprehended by the dvil power are to be sent back to their regiments whenever that can be done, there to be dealt with by the military authorities. When such men cannot be sent back to their regiments immediately they should be detained in prison pending the orders of Government to whom a report is to be made addressed to the Secretary to Government in the military department. " Native officers and soldiers, belng mutineers or deserters, taken before or apprehended by the civil power, not found or apprehended with arms in their posseselon, not charged with any specific act of rebellion and belonging to a regiment which hba mutinied, but has not been guilty of the murder of its officers or of any other sanguinary crime, are to be sent to Allahabad, or to such other place as Government may hereafter order, and are there to be made over to the commandaant, to be dealt with by the military authorities. Should any difflculty arise in sending the offender to Allahabad, either by reason of its distance from the place of arrest or otherwise, the offender should be Imprisoned untl the orders of Government can ba obtained, unless for special reasons it may be necessary to punish the offender forthwith, in which case a report will Immediately afterwards be made to the Government. " Every mutineer or deserter who may be taken before or apprehended 'by the civil authorities, and who may be found to belong to a regiment which killed any European officer or other European, or committed any other sanguinary outrage, may be tried and punished by the civil power. Jf the prisoner can show that he was not present at the murder or other outrage, or, if present, that he did his utmost to prevent it, full particulas of the case should be reported to Government in the Military Department, before the sentence, whatever It be, Is carried into effect, otherwise the sentence should be carried into effect forthwith. " If it cannot be ascertained to what regiment a mntineer or deserter taken before or apprehended by the civil authorities belonged, he is to be dealt with as provided by the second rule. " 7. Lists shownbg the several regiments and detachments which have mutMned will be prepared with all practicable despatch in the Military Department, stating in each case aU known particulars of the mutiny and accompanied by nominal rolls, with appropriate remarks opposite to the names of those native officers and men who are known to have been absent from their -egiment at the time of the matiny, nnd of those who, if present, are known to have taken an active part either in promoting or suppressing the mutiny, or tohave simply joined or abstained from joiningit. These nominal rolls as soon as prepared wil be printed and circulated to all civil officers and to military officers in command. " S. The Governor-General in Council is anuxous to prevent measures of extreme severity being unnecessarily resorted to, or carried to excess, or applied without due discrimination, in regard to acts of rebellion commnitted by persons not mutineers. " 9. It is unquestionably necessary, in the first attempt to restore order in a district in which the civil authority has been entirdly overthrown, to administer the law with such promnptitude and severity as 'will strike terror into the miinds of the evil disposed among the people, and vwil induce them by the fear of death to ab. stain from plunder, to restore stolen property, and return to peaceful occupations. But this object once in a great degree attained, the punishment of crimes should be regalated witli discrimination. " 10. Tqe continued administration of the law in its utmost severity, after the requisite impression has been made upon t he rebellious and disorderly, and after order hasbeen partially restored, weuld have the effect of exasperating the people, asid would probably induce them to band to gether in large numbers for the protection of their lives and with a view to retaliation, a result much to be daprecated. It would greatly add to the difficulties of settling the country hereafter. If a spirit of animosity against their rulers vwere engendered in the minds of the people, and if their feelings were emabittered by the remembrance of noeeless bloodshed, the civil officers in every distieFt Lhn,,ld endeavour, without cannoning any heinous offences or making any promises of pardon for such offences, to encourage aU persons to return to their usual occupations, and, punishing only such of the prineipal offenders as can be apprehended, to postpone as far as possible aUl minute inquiry into political offences until such time as the Government are in a position to deal with them in strength after thorough investigatton. lt may be necessary, however, even after a district is partially restored to order, to make examples from time to time of such persons, of any who may be guilty of serious outrages against person or property, or who, by stopping the da&]k or injuring tha eltctric telegraph or otherwise, may endervour to promote the designs of those who are waging waragainst the State. " 11. Anotber polnt to be noticed in connexion with this subject is the general burning of vil1ages, which the Governor-General in Council bas reason to fear may have been carried too far by some of the ml officers employed in restoring order. " 12. A severe measure of thil somt is deobtless necessary as an example in some cases, -where thae mass of the inhabitants of a village hava aeomlitted a grave outra,. and the perpetrators cannot be punbe3d in their persons, but any approach to a wholeta destruction of property by the officers of Govornment, without due regrd to the gailt or innocence of tlhose who aze affected by It, must be stronq,ly repreheurled. Apa7t from the effect which such a practice would ',iavo upon the feelings and disposition of the eountry p,:ople, there can be no doubt that it would prevent themn from rtrning to their villages and resum.ng the uultivat',,n of teir fields- pcoint at this season of vital impr.rtance. iasmuch as if the lands temahA much longer u' .sown distress and even famino may be added to the oth,' r difflc'..-aes with 7~~ the Governnent will have to coa end.

Of the Madras establishment it is known that Major Renaud and Lieutenant Richardson, of the Fusileers; Captam Gordon, Deputy Commissioner, Jhansi; Lieutenant Grant, Assstant Commissioner of Oude; and Lieutenant Parsons, of the Oude Irregular Foroe, have fallen, Of the Bombay establishment Colonel Penny, Captain Spottiswoode, and Cornet Newbury, of the BombayLancers, tell at Nusseerabad; and Lieutenant Nicolson and Ensign Heathfield, of the 27th Native Infantry, and Ensign Stubbs, of the 9th, at Kolapore. Very little Is known of the casualties in the Punjab, and the foregoing list only inclties three who feU there. Of those who have been reported as severely wounded no sub. sequent accounts have been received except in a few cases. Of the 18th, 28th, and 41st Bengal Regiments very little is known; but it Is feared that nearly all the offlcers who were with these regiments (at Bareilly, Shahjehanpore, and Soetapore)'have perished. It is also feared that a considerable proportion of the officers in Luoknow may have faUen. They consisted of the offioers of the Queen's 32d and of one company of the 81th, of the Bengal 13th, 48th, and 71st, of the 7th Cavalry, several offlcers of the Engineers and ArtUery, and of the Oude Irregular Force. No complete list can at present be compUed of the members of the military familes who have met an wntimely end. Of the uncovenanted servioe it is knowu that Dr. Buck, of the Bareilly College; Mr. Tregear, of the Delhi Colege ; Mr. Stroyan, Assistant Commissioner in Oude; Mr. F, Hulbard, Professor of Agra College, and many more have been murdered. Among the persons unconnected with Government Mr. Heatly, editor of the DeThi GaeUe; Mr. Tandy, late secretary of the North-Western Bank; many merchants and traders, and [Mr. Newlands, the photographer, have been killed; and the foUowing list has been published of the missionaries who have fallen victims: -The Rev. A. R. Hulbard, of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the Rev. J. Mackay, of the Baptist Mission at Delhi; the Rev. W. H. Haycock, and H. Cookey, of the Sooiety for the Propagation of the Gospel at Cawnpore; the Rev. J. Macallum of the Additional Clergy Society at Shabjehanpore; the Revs. Messrs. Freeman, Johnstone, Campbell, M'Miuien, and their families, of the American Presbyterian Mission at Futteyghur; and the Rev. Mr. Hunter and family of the Scottish Mission at Sealkote. Of the civilians who have fallen the following is believed to be a correct list:-Simon Fraser, D. Robertson, T. K. Iaoyd, R. T. Tucker, G. D. Raikes, R. B. Thornhill, J. P. MWhirter, C. J. illMeraden, J. E. Hutchinson, J. Strachey, A. Galloway, G. J. Christian, J. Wedderburn W. C. Watson, M. Ricketts, H. B. Thornhill, J. M. Mac: IdUop, A. Johnstone, J. G. Thomason, A. IL Block, R. N. Lewis, R. B. Cuppage, C. V. Jenkins (9), W. H. Moore, D Grant, C. W. Cunliffe, J. B. Thornhill, and R. H. Pomeroy, The following is an extract from a letter dated tfmballa, August 2 - " I have just helped on a heavy train of siege guns-24 guns and mortars of heavy calibre, and 1,200 cartloads of ahot and shell. They should reach Delhi about the 6th of September, and, allowing them a week for getting them into position, the attaok may possibly take place about the 15th or 20th. In the meantime the rebels have gone out on a marauding expedition towards Hansi, where General Van Cortlandtis with a small force, quite ready to thrash them."

COLONEL MOUNTAIN.* A pure-minded gentleman and a brave soldier wiU come out well under every presentment of his life's story; and a Memoir which is slight and domestic may thus help us to the knowledge of an exemplary character in the person of the late Colonel Armine S. H. Mountain. Colonel Mountain was not a genius of the first force, but he had capacities which fuUy entitled him to a high professional status, while his moral scrupulousness, his refinement, and the Bayard-like chivalry with which he more than fulfilled the strict requirements of duty at aU times, justify the desire to preserve a literary record of his career for the sake of the British army, to whom it is dedicated. The memoir, which includes many of his private letters, has been edited by his widow, who has performed her labour of love with a devotion to her husband's memory which wiU be appreciated by all who knew him, and especialy by his comrades. Armine Simcoe Henry Mountain was the fifth son of Jacob Mountain, first Bishop of Quebec, and was born in 1797. His family claim to have been descended from that of Montaigne, and came over to England on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and Dr. Mountain, his father, was appointed to the dioceas of Quebec on its creation in 1793, and presided over the church in Canada for 32 years. Armine was sent to England to be educated and received his commission as Ensign in the 96th kegiment in 1815, to his vexation, just too late to take part in t7he European war. From the first his character indicated him to the approval of discerning judges, and Miss Edgeworth, whose acquaintance he was fortunate enough to make, wrote of him about this time with the following marked emphasis," If you were to cut Armine Mountain into 100 pieces, every one of them would be a gentleman." In the absence of any opening in the profession he had chosen, for seven or eight years he travelled or sojourned chiefly on the continent, acquiring foreign languages and informing hisl mnind; and various lettera to his family and friends, showing how he employed himself during this interval, are preserved in the present volume. In the summer of 1823 he returned to England to be admired, praised, and even petted as " the most accomplished, elegant, and handsome young man possible," and he then got a lieutenancy by the favour of the Duke of York in the 52d. The Light Infantry regiments, but particularly the 43d, 62d, and 85th, being then considered the crack corps of the army, as he himself says, he was generaUy congratulated on his good fortune. He spent some time with this regiment in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but on his father's death in 1825 he took his mother to England, and by the assistance of his relatives obtained a company by purchase in the 95th Regiment, then quartered in Jersey. Eis allowance from his father had now ceased, and it is worthy of mention that he not only lived entirely on his pay as a captain but scrupulously paid off the debt he had contracted in the purchase of his company. Sir Colin Halkett, who made his acquaintance at Jersey in 1826, was so won by his personal qualities and devotion to his military duties that he made every endeavour to advance him in life; and an application for an unattached majority suggested by him was granted by the Duke of York on his deathbed in consideration of Armine's high character and of his father's services. Armine made various efforts to be restored to ful pay, but nothing could be done for him at the Horse Guards unless he could give the difference, and in 1828, at the suggestion of Lord Dalhousie, then going out to India as Commanderin-Chief, by the kindness of his relative: he was enabled to get into the 26th Cameronians, then stationed at Madras; but, to secure his relatives from loss by his death, he insured his life, and yet continued punctuaUy to pay off by instalments the heavy debt he had thus contracted. On his voyage out to India he atudied Hindostanee and Persian, and details of his movements from station to station of his military duties, and of his observations on the natives and their capacities abound at this atage of his career. Among the latter, the following has considerable interest in connexion with our recent experiences, while the anticipation with which it concludes may possibly be realized at no distant date:- " These Ghorkhas are a singular race; they were first known as a mountain tribe in the neighbourhood of Nepaul, and, after having raised their chief to the throne of that kingdom, they subsequently extended their conquests over all the hill states to the Setlej. They must have been originally Tartars, or possibly Chinese, having precisely the features of the latter nation; but ae smaller men and generaUy darker. . . Thelr conquests, and the atubborn resistance which they made to the British troops, are proofs of their activity and energy. Captsin Nicholson afirms that they have all the virtues and none of the vices of the European soldier. My credulity is not wide enough to take in this; but Lord William seems to have a high opinion of them, and to prefer them to the Sepoy of the plains. The hill people, including the Ghorkhas, are Hindoos, do not kill the cow, and have a sort of inferior Brahinin among them; but they have no distinction of caste among themselves, and fewer prejudices than their lowland neighbours. In some parts of the hills they are said to reverse the order of the plair't several men being content with one wife; but this, I belleve, was more conmon in former days, when female in fanticide wras practised. I should be inclined tothiak that it would be less ddifelttointrodueeChristlanity aomong these people than perhaps any other portion of Sir Colin Halkett, who had himself come to Indla as Commander-in-Chief at Bombay, made him his military secretary, but Sir Colin disagreeingwithLord Clare, was recalled, and MountainIost his post, but was invited by Lord W. Bentinck to join his staff. When Lord William, in 1835, resolved to leave India, Major Mountain returned to England to try whether he could obtain a Lieutenant-Colonelcy, but he made many attempts in vain, and in 1840, after 14 years' service in hi, present grade, he was still M,ajor Mountain. WYhen Lord Auckland selected him to fill the post of Adjutant-General with the expeditionary force to be sent out to China, he was present at most of the principal operations there,-in fact, he bore a very distinguished part in them, having shown great gallantry at Anmoy, Chusan, and Chafoo. At the latter place, in attacking a joss-house which was obstinately defended, three musket balls passed through his havresack and three more entered his body, so that he was severely wounded, and for a time hors de comba. His agents at Calcutta failed about the same time, and he lost nearly the whole of the money he had saved. Yet when Sir Hugh Gough offered to send him to England with the despatches announcing the conclusion of the war, which would have sectured to him the rank of a full Colonel, he waived the opportunity on behalf of another officer who had unconsciously asked him to recommend him to the General for the same office. The young officer received in consequence the rank of major, while Colonel AIountain waited three years before the rank of Aide-do-Camp was conferred upon himself. Mloreover, when Sir H. Gough heard that he was to be nominated Commander-in-Chief in India, and proposed to Colonel Mountain to become his military secretary, the latter again gave way, because the previous evening a nephew of Sir Hugh Gough had confided to him his desire to fill this situation. So ready was he at all times to sacrifice himself to the advancement of others. The Duke of Wellington, however, on looking over the list of officers ;ho had served in China, put his finger on Colonel Mountain's name, saying, "' This man has done his work remarkably well; I should like to do something for him." But nothing was done for him at this time, and when the brevet for the China war was published, his name, to the disappointment of all his comrades, was not included, because he had only recently obtained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and it was unusual to give the rank of full Colonel so soon, no consideration being had for the circumstance that he had been 13 years a Major. He himself, it is said, keenly felt the omission, but he persevered diligently in the command of his regiment, which he had brought into the highest state of discipline and efficiency, repressing extravagance among the young offlcers, and at the same time providing barrack accommodation, schools, and a reading-room for the men, and trying to induce them to resist the whiskey bottle on behalf of the regimental savings-bank,-in short, proving himself in every respect a worthy and excellent officer. When the brevet for Gwalior was granted, he, however, found, to his surprise, his name in the Ga.zettr as Aide-de-Camp to the Queen, but this was because the Duke considereditwould beunjust topromoteany one else while he was unrewarded for his exploits in China. In 1847, being then in Ireland with his regiment, he was offered by the Earl of Dalhousie, who was then selected to lne Governor-General of India, the appointment of Military Secretary, which he accepted. On his departure he received a re- .3ftnoirs and Lcttcrs of tMe Late ColondArmnine S. H. Mountain, C.B., &a. Edited by Mn. A, S. H. Mountain. Longma:; 1857. markable ovation from his regiment, which he ob-. tained from the Governor-General leave to rejoin in the field when the war with the Sikhs was decided upon. At Chillianwallah he displayed conspicuous gallantry, carrying his brigade through a fire in which nearly half of them were killed or wounded. He was present at Goojerat, where, however, the infantry had little to do, and the last shots fired in the campaign were fired at hiTn as he was reconnoitring. A severe wround, which he received accidentally from the explosion of one of his holster pistols, obliged him then to retire to Simla In order to recrnit himself:- -When the GarcUc containing the honours for the campaign reached Simla, disappointment was felt by Terymany, incYuding those of the highest rank in the country, that Colonel Mountain's name was not among those who received any mark of distinction, Here, again the old system of routine was continued, and as Colonel lountain had only commanded as Brigadier, and not as Brigadier-General, in the battles of Chillianwallah and Goojerat, and As the awards to brigadiers were the rank of C.,B. and Aide-de.-Carnp to the Queen, both of which had been bestoved upon him for fosmer services, he wras nowr left unnotxoed. For it mnust be remembered that the appointment of Adjutant-General was conferred upon him from home before the news of any general action had been received. '"Some friends in England, feeing that the omission of his name in the a mit be misunderstood, brought forward thesubject in the House of Commons, when, in answer to a question from Sir H. Verney, Mr. Fox Mauls explained the reason why tho name of Colonel Mountain had not appeared in the GawrtU among the list of officers who had received honours on acoount of their conduct in the Indian war. 'It had been determined,' he said, 'that the honour of the second class of the Bath should be given to those offioers who commanded divisions in the action at Goojerat, and Colonel Mountain did not come within that category. Colonel Mountain was in the action, but com. manded only a brigade, and for that was entitled to the honour of the third class of the Bath, and also of being ap. pointed Aide-de-Camp to the Queen. It happened, bowever, that Colonel Mountain had already gained both those bonours by his gallantry in another field, and there. fore they could not now be conferred upon him. It mnst not be supposed that the gallantry and skill of that distinguished officer were not adequately appreciated. both by the Governmnent and the military au-. thorities. So far, indeed, was that from being the case that, on the recommendation of the Governor-Genera4 hacked by the Commander-in-Chief, Colonel Montain had received the offer of the highest milit appointment in India, that of Adjutant-General to the Indian army.' In 1852his health wasdelining, and ln851 he died. The last years of his life appear to have elicited from himproofsof theame 'ortitude and gentleness he had exhibited in more active scenes. He was now taxed in his endurance and refsignation, but the qualities of a Christian gentleman survived al his trials, and were cordialy honoured and admired by his comrades. "Y ou will receive," said Lord Dalhousie to Mrs. Mountain, "ass no empty words, my testimony that a truer heart, a nobler spint, a mind more refined or more trustworthy, never lived on earth or passed from earth to Heaven." Two points in his correspondence are particularly important at the present moment, and the first contains a statement which we commend to the attention of Cardinal Wiseman:- " We have some excellent men among the clergy in India, and I should say that a great deal is doing both to improve the natives and to promote good conduct among ourselves. Some of the Roman Catholic priests whom the Government pays (the Irish) are downrighi rebels, and do their utmost to foment discontent among our Romanist troops, but their success is small, for our discipline is triumphant, and our system such that, upon the whole, the men are attached to their officers." The next point is more important, for it shows that he, among others, was sensible of the disorganization going forward in the Bengal army from other causes, for he wrote thus to Sir H. Verney on the 6th of March, 1852 - " The present state of things, in Bengal particularly, needs revision. An officer, perhaps after I8 years service in the commaisariat or other civil department, on promotion, or on return from sick furlough, falls back upon his regiment as major, and commands it. All the Captains, but one, are either on furlough in Europe or on detacbed employ, so are moat of the senior subalterns, of whom perhaps the adjutant and quartermaster, and three or iour young ensigns only, are with the regiment, The commanding officer knows nothing of regimental duty, or of teaching the young officers their v;ork-is either harsh or lax and careless; and the boys run wild. This is not at all an extreme, but a very common case, and it is only wonderful that the servce gets on as -, :ll as it does. It is impossible that the Sepoys can feel attachment to commanders who have not seen their regiments for 15 or 20 years, or to boys who have their duty to learn. " The recent regulations requiring officers to pass in the language are working well, and, as matters stand, it would be perhaps undesirable to restrict the choice of Government or to deprive the military service of the sbare of political and military employments which of late years have been opened to it. The remedies might be to increase the num- ber of officers proportionally to the increase in the numberof detached employments, and to make a certain and reasonable term of regimental duty a necessary condition to regimental command, But the Company's service is a great lottery. Many men get on by merit where opportunity has favoured them and brought them into notice. The majority, however, are seleoted in the first Instance by interest. From the moment that a youngster is posted to a regiment, particularly an infantry regiment, his first object is to get away from it. Can you blame him? His regimental rank goes on the same whether he sees his corps for 20 years or not." In the main, however, the interest of this volume consists of its personal materials for the illustration of a character peculiarly worthy and estimable.

FORBIGN INTELLIGE.NUGE. IXI ANCE. (FROM OUR OWlV CORRv A,nv'v z [A porUon of the following appeazed h our second editioza ox yesterday :-] PARIS, OCT. U', 6 P.m. A report current this week, but which obtained no credit, that the British and Austrian Ambassadors at Constantirtople had protestedI against the second MIoldavian elections, on tLe ground of illcgality and malpractices, was founded, as it now appears, on the fact that M. de Prokesch received from the Austrian Commissioner in the Principalities a communication concerning the elections, pointing out a great number of irregularities. This document wau submitted to the Sublime Porte, and is to be sent to Paris, to be laid before the Congress when it assembles. That there is abundant foundation for the complaints it contains is perfectly weil known here, and by none better than by the French Government itself. If the Moldavian elections, however, were to be repeated until they were carried out withoult pressure or corruption being alleged by either party, the organization of the Principalities would be indefinitely adjourned. Perfect purity of election-hard to obtain anywhere-is not to be hoped for in Moldo-Wallachia, at least under present circumstances, and in the presence of a number of foreign agents, some of vwhom (and the French Consul at J assy may be cited as an example) seem to consider themselves authorized electioneermg agents. I suppose we shall be told that since Turkey unduly interfered in the first instance it is de bonne gutrre, only fair fighting, for France and Russia to follow her example in those second elections which they provoked and insisted upon. The late virtuous indignation at corrupt practices is all forgotten now that such practices are charged against the recently indignant parties. It is, however, pretty certain that there would have been little to gain by a protest against the last elections made, and, indeed, to have put further impediments in the way of a final settlement of this wearisome and long-pending question would probably have been neither convenient nor politic. The elections have taken place, the Divans have come together, and it is presumable we shaU soon know their mind as to what kind of government is best for their country. When the Paris Congress assembles to decide finally on the subject, the representati ma of the Austrian Commissioner will be submitted t it; and it will be for those of the Powers tb.t are not blindly wedded to a particular policy, but which desire the truth to be elicited and right to be done, to take into consideration the statements and proofs they contain, and to allow them due weight in comdng to a decision. This Moldo-Wallachian question has certainly given rise to more party feeling abroad than was to be expected from its nature. The French Government has adopted with reference to it a line of policy for which it must be supposed to have reasons that have not yet been divined. We must be permitted to pass very lightly over that conscientious zeal for purity of election which led to the annulling of the Moldavian Divan first chosen. It is presumable that some stronger motive than the desire to acquire popularity in the Principalities induced France to run counter to the views of her closest ally, and to espouse those of Russia, from whom any suggestion regarding those provinces must always be received with suspicion. If, however, she thought it important to gain favour with the Roumans, there is no doubt that as far as that goes her policy has been successful. The prestige of EZngland was a very short time since far greater in Moldo-Wallachia than that of France, which latter country was considered to have been remiss in not supporting in 1848 the national Rlouman cause. Little more than a twelvemonth ago England was the country which the Roumans regarded, before all others, with feelings of friendship and hope. Abeut that time doubts began to creep in. The French agent in Wallachia suddenly declared himself a decided and warm partisan of the Union, andthrew himself completely into the arms of the adivanced Liberals. The English agent, on the other hand, kept on the reserve, and avoided committing himself to any policy or allowing his sentiments to be fathomed. This caused many eyes to be turned towards France as their best hope. Subsequent events maintained this new direction, and already before the elections began the vane had veered completely round. French influence is now paramount in the Principalities. This Government is perfectly right to declare that should the Union, under a foreign Prince, be decided upon, it puts forward no candidate for the new crown, and wishes the MoldoWallachians to be left the free choice of their Sovereign. It has no occasion openly to set up a candidate. A hint wiUl suffice for the Roumans immediately to select the Prince whom France desires to see placed over them. Of this I do not believe that the slightest doubt wil be entertained by any who have means of knowving the present state ef feeling in the D)anubian provinces. It is very confidently stated that as soon as the question of the Danubian 1rincipalities shaU have been settled that of the Suez Canal will be again officially presented to the examinationi of the Ottoman Porte. I hear that some of the smaller German Governments, although they have allowed their subjects to receive the medal of St. Helena, have refused their authorization to wear it. To-day's French papers havo little that requires comment or merits extract. They are chiefly occupied with Indian affairs. The eccentric Unircrs, as universal in its acquirements as it is infallible in its criticism, tells us what our generals and armies ought to have done and ought to do in India. I subjoin a portion of the article containing some strange parallels and gleoly predictions. " If," says that journal,- " Less filled with that presumption for which wo Frenchmen are often reproached, the (:overnment of Indla had understood the gravity of events, it would have hastened to concentrate its troops, to march to the assistance of the besieged corps, and would not have assumed the offensive until after it had put the positions on which it relied for support inA a perfect state of defence. At the time when the Milanese rose Marshal Radetzki effected his retreat with the greatest order; he rallied his troops, and did not commence the offensive until he had well secured his position. He then began to advance and did not again stop, not even when opposed by the troops which the unfortunate Charles Albert brought to the assistance of his countrymen. In the wars of the Empire it was not until the Duke of WeUington had commenced his operations with the prudence and steadiness which characterized him that the saccesses of the British army became more and more important. It wil only be by the adoption of a similar proceeding that any hopo of reestablishing English domination In India can be entertained. It is also necessary that reinforcements should arrive promptly, and should be powerful enough to be able to sup port the corps d'earmc which shall be sent Into the Interior of the country, UIntil that tiuie the European troops will be obliged to establish themselves round the Insergent countries, to observe the movements of the enemy, and to wait for a favourable opportunity o& assuming the offensive. If the English, as they frequently do, com. mit faults at the outset of a campaign, if they presume too much on their strength and power, few nations know so well how to show energy and perseverance enough to repair the errors committed and recover the ground lost. It is not until the very last extremity that they relinquish their undertakings. This time, however, they have to contend with difficulties over which they will triumph less easily than over those which they have hitherto had to surmount. They must in a fewi months or a few years retake a country which it took them 1;0 years to conquer. We doubt whether they will succeed in this arduous task. The future may contradict our previsions. Nevertheless, we repeat that England will not for a very long time recover that undisputed authority which she exercised over the whole of the Indian peninsula, that consequently her resources and her commerce are about to be considerably lessened, and that the still vast and populous possessions over which she hopes to preserve her domination may become more burdensome than profitable." A letter of the 10th inst.from Naples mentions the arrival there of the Prince of Orange on board the Dutch frigate Frovingen, attended by the screwv steam frigate Admiral von Vastenaar, of 45 gans. Carriages belonging to the Court had been placed at the disposal of the Prince, who, after calling on those members of the Royal family then at Naples, had visited the monuments, museums, and antiquities of that capital and its environs. Excavations had been ordered at Pompeii, and a house was to be dug out in the presence of the Prince. The marriage of the Duke of Calabria, heir to the Crown of the Two Sicilies, with a Princess of Bavaria, is not to take place, it wEs said at Naples, before the expiration of a year. The duke is shortly to travel abroad, when he will have an opportunity of making the acquaintance of his future wife. The vintage in Sicily, as well as in the kingdom of Naples, had been favoured by beautiful weather, and its result was very good. The oldium, which had attacked not only the vines but the figtrees, has disappeared in various districts, and in others it has been successfully combated with sulphur. The efficacy of this application appears to be placed beyond a doubt, and it will henceforward be generally adopted in the INTeapolitan and Sicilian vineyards, although some of the growers were at first superstitiously opposed to the innovation. The Court is expected to go to Compipgne on the 18th inst. Marshal Randon, who dined yesterday with the Emperor at St. Cloud, is, as I understand, ahortly to return to Africa. It is again positively stated that Generals Montauban and Beaufort, commanding the province and district in which the Doineau affair occurred, are to be removed from their posts. Despatches from Berlin announce the arrival there of the Marquis de Moustier, French Minister to the Court of Prussia. The Marquis had expressed to the different members of the Royal family the great interest felt by the Emperor Napoleon in the health of the King of Prussia. A telegraphic despatch of the 12th from Bucha. rest says as follows:- "The opening of the Wallachian Divan has just taken place. The news of the illness of the King of Prussia has produced & deep impression here. To-morrow prayers will be offered up in the Protestant Church for the re-establishn.ent of His Majesty." The M4aonite ur publishes the official return of the amount of the receipt of the taxes and indirect revenue for the nine expired months of 1857, as compared with the corresponding period of 1856. The amount of the former period was 781,083,000f., being an increase of 2G,865,000f. on the latter. As compared with the first nine months of 1855 the receipts of the present year show an increase of 81,294,000f. The principal items of revenue which show an increase in 1857 over 1856 are Customs' duties on importation of foreign sugar, 8,275,000f.; of sundry merchandise, 6,940,000f. ; duty on potable liquors, 7,720,000f.; sale of tobacco, 7,488,000f.; registration dues, 1,942,000f. ; stamp duty, 591,000£f; navigation dues, 280,000f.; salt-tax, 1,367,000f.; Customs} duty on exports, 34,000f.; sundry Customs' receipts, 23,000f.; sale of gunpowder, 490,000f.; transit duty on foreign letters, 260,OOOf.

The following is the latest biulletin of the King of Prussia's health, received by telegraph:- ' SANS SOUCI, Ocr. 14, 7 P.M. iThe health of His Majesty the King this evening continues in the same favourable state as this morning. SCEONLEI. "WEISS." (FROM OUR OWN COR'ESON2DNT.) BERLIN, Oct. 14. In myletter of last Saturday, thelOthinst., inyour impression of Monday (second edition), I mentioned that a Ministerial CounCl had been summoned to meet that morning at Potsdam, where the MinisterPresident was to remain for the present to a certain degree en perminenec. The subject of that Ministerial Council was, as may easily be conjectured, the state of His Majesty's health, and the steps to be taken in connexion with the two contingencies of his tardy recovery or his speedy decease. This latter eventuality was, happily, soon put out of the question for the moment; but it had been firmly enough contemplated the night before, for the troops in the two garrisons of Berlin and Potsdam were on Saturday morning consignis to their barracks in order that in the event of the demise of the Crown the succes3ion of the heir to the throne might be proclaimed simultaneously with the decease of the present occupant. The result of that Ministerial Council was a resolution on the part of the Ministers to call upon the Prince of Prussia to take upon himself the conduct of public business, which was accordingly done by their waiting on hinm and laying before him the minutes of their deliberations, together with the resolutions they had come to. This step seems at first sight to one uninitiated in the state of Government business, and viewing things imperfectly at a distance, to have been unnecessarily precipitate; but I learn that administrative business is already very deeply in arrears in consequence of the King's repeated absence from the seat of government since the beginning of last June, and that the state machine is in some portions of its mechanism already very nearly brought to a standstill. This of course would justify the desire felt by Ministers to see some provision made for the transaction of business, since, even assunming the moat favourable turn to the King's illness, some long time must elapse before he can devote himself to the transaction of all the accumulations of business that await him. The course, however, which the IMinisters proposed to the Prince of Prussia was one not prescribed by the charter, and consequently opposed to it, inasmuch as t-his form of constitution contains provisions for the contingency under consideration and this the Prince pointed out to them while declining to comply with their summons. Article 56 of the charter requires that- "When the King Is under age, or otherwise prevented for any length of time from governing himself, that agnate of his, being of fuU age, who stauds nearest to the Crown takes upon himself the Regency. He has hereupon without loss of time to summon the Chambers, which shall, in a combined sitting of the two Chambers, decide upon the neces sity of a Regency." The Prince pointed ouit to the Ministers that the contingency contemplated by this article of the charter bad not yet supervened, inasmuch as there was no evidence to show that the then present state of the King's health would be of lengthy duration, and that whenever this should be the case then he would assume the Regency in virtue of the provisions of the charter, and that no summons or invitation on the part of the Ministers was necessary to enable him to take that step. On the other hand, with reference to the temporary assumption of the conduct of public business when there was proved necessity for a Regency, the Prince of Prussia declared he could only take that course at the express commandof the King his brother, which would equally supersede the necessity of any invitation from Ministers or any other body in the kingdom. The preliminary question, therefore, requiiring to be solved was at that time-Is the King's illness of such a nature as to entail upon him a lengthy incapacity from public affairs; or is he likely soon again to be in a state to exert his monarchical functions? On these Doints the physicians in attendance declared their inability to form a positive judgment until after the lapse of the ninith day from the commencement of the attack (this will not be till to-morrow, the 15th, the King's birthday), nor do I imagine that they will certainly be in a position to do so then. The contingencies are therefore-1. The immediate demise of the King, which seems at present to be removed beyond the sphere of probability. 2. The evident incapacity of the King for the further conduct of public affairs; in which case the Prince of Prussia would, on the declaration of His Majesty's physicians to that effect, assume the Regency. This contingency aIso appears, according to the very satisfactory intel- ligence of the last 24 hours, to be less likely to stipervene than the 3d,-viz., that the King will recover from this attack and attain the ample use of his bodily and mental faculties again, but nevertheless find it desirable to intrust the Prince of Prussia with the conduct of public business for a longer or shorter period. There is also a fourth contingency that must by no means be overlooked, when one bears in mind the King's activity of mind, his high ideas of divine right, &c.-viz., that as long as he lives he may refuse to nominate even his brother to take his place in the management of public affairs, although himself not able for some time to come to transact business to the necessary extent. During the whole of yesterday the King's state seemed to be improving steadily, though slowly, and in the course of the afternoon he caused himself to be led to one of the windows of his room that he might enjoy the beauty of the landscape, just then lit up by the autumn sun. The weather continues very beautiful,and favourable for the recovery of any invalid; and it can hardly be too highly appreciated as a fortunate circtusmtance that the King should have encountered this illness in Potsdam, surrounded by pure air, rather than here in Berlin, or in his own palace rather than under a strange roof, at the seat of the Duke of Augustenburg. The Princess of Prussia has not arrived at Sane Souci. The receipt of the good news on Saturday of the Kinges having rallied induced her to remain at Coblenz. The Prince of Prussia, who has for a long time past been on the most excellent terms with his Royal brother, is spoken of as exhibiting the most unremitting kindness in support of the Queen during this period of her affliction. A USTRIA. (sIaom oUn OWN connBlEONDiT. ' VIENNA, OoT. 13. The foUowing extract from the Nuremlerg Correspondent has been transferred to the columns of the principal organs of the German press .- "A according to reliable communications from Vierca, the Jate of Count BQol's health is such that in all probabilitY hewill, after having taken the waters of Carlsbad. be unable for some time to come to undertake the direction of the business of his departnent. Notwithstanding the contra. dictions of some of the papers, It is certaia that Count Buol, being induced so to do by the unsatisfactory state of his health, did tender his resignation to the Emperor towards the end of the last mont His Majesty, however, declined to accept It." The sourcefromwhich the Bavarian paper obtained its information is unknown to me, but certain it is that the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs is likely to be at his post again in a fortnight or three weeks, as the waters of Carlsbad have produced a very beneficial effect on his health. The assertion that he tendered his resignation to the Emperor is erroneous, and it is well known in the diplomatic world that the report was originally spread by the Russians residing in this city. It is a positive fact that Count Buol is still in high favour with his Sovereign, and it ix well that such is the case, for if he were to quit office the philo-Russians would get the upper hand and againmake Austria a bond-slave to Russia. The recent policy of the French Government towards Austria is a perfect mystery to me. It seems to be intent on undoing the work of its own hands, and to wish to bring about an alliance between Russia, Prussia, and Austria. Thxee or four years ago the French Cabinet was extremely desirous to be on a friendly footing with Austria, but ever since the conclusion f of the treaty of April 15, 1856, by which England, France, and Austria guaranteed the independence and integrity of the Porte, the relations between the two Governments have been cool, and somettmes positively unfriendly. A diplomatist a few days since remarked in my pre. sence that persons who wished to make themselves agreeable to French and English statesmen would do well altogether to forget that such a document as the Treaty of April the 6th wasin existence. As it is very possible that one or other of the Vienna correspondents of the foreign papers may isoon give a full, true, and particular account of what passed between the Emperors Alexander and Francis Joseph at Weimar, it may be well to state that the very best informed personsinthis city know nothing at all about the matter. It is said in some of the German papers that the Austrian Foreign-Office has forwarded a circular to its agents abroad, explaining that the meeting of the two monarchs at Weimar was a personal affair, and of no political importance, but it is not known to me that any such sbtep has been taken. As there have been many discussions in the public papers as to whether the Emperor of Austria or the Emperor of Russia proposed that a meeting should take'place, it maybe well once again to state how the affair was managed. Prince Alexander of He-se, the brother of the Empress of Russia, " felt the pulse" of both parties, and, as he found that they were equally inclined to lot bygones be bygones, the arrangements for a meeting were soon made. The only difficulty which presented itself was the place of rendezvous and that was eventually removed by the Grana Duke of Weimar. The St. Helena medal affords plenty of occupation to the German warriors who served under Napoleon I. On the 3d inst. " A Society of South German Veterans" wrote the following letter to the "V Veteran Staff" at Weimar: "The article forwarded to the Fran7fort JTurrnzl from Wei-uar on the 27th of September we must consider a mystification, for only men in their dotage could think of agitating against such a badge of honour as is the St. Helena medal. If the Weimar veterans are not of this opinion they were never worthy to belong to the Great Army." To this elegant effusion the following reply was returned by the irascible "I Veteran Staff ."- "1 If the anuthor of the letter signed ' A Society of South German Veterane was in possession of honour and courage he would have given his name. We belonged to the C-reat Army and to the now army, and if we, as Germans, hadI received any order on the spot for a deed of arms we could have worn it with honour. Now, however, after a lapse of 42 years, during which our fatherland has taken up a very different position, we reject with disdain a medal which is offered us ' by a very different monarch.' We honour and respewt the nationality of the French, and we expect that they wll also honour and respect ours. If the Darmstadt 'riter doea not feel and understand this he did not learn mnuch in the Great Army, and does not know what patriotlsm Is. Fortunately our beautiful fatherland is somewhat less in dotage than the Darmstadt veteran." Since the King of Prussia has been so ill the feeling of the Austrians towards him has undergone a most remarkable change. Formerly he was oniver. sally abused, but now people seem to remember only his virtues. His generosity towards men of science and artists is highly lauded, and his many good qualities of heart and head are brought into the very strongest relief. Information has been received here that the Russian, French, and Prussian members of the Europ can Danubian Commission left Galatz in the Danubian Company's steamer Arpad on the 25th of September. The three delegates, who were accompanied by Privy Councillor Nobiling, a skilful engineer in the service of the Prussian Government, reached Turn-Severin on the 27th, and requested the emnphnyj6s in the service of the Danubian Steam Wavigation Company to give them copies of their charts of the river, on which all the shalows and rapids are accurately marked. As the diractor of the establishment at Turn-Severin declined to place at the disposal of the " Commission for the Mouths of the Danube " the result of 25 years' labour and dearly-bought experience, it proceeded to Orsova, where another unsuccessful application was made at the office of the company for copies of the char's. M. Nobiling, the engineer, remained at the " Iron Gate," but' the three commnissioners returned to Galatz on the 1st. On the 29th of September the French war steamer Moeurtrier arrived at TurnuMagurella, near Nicopolis, and the Russian war steamer Ordinarez cast anchor at Giurgevo, as if " to rile" the Turks in the fortress of Rustchuk, which is directly opposite. The following arrangement has been made by the Credit and Discount Banks with tho firm of Boskowitz --The latter having shown that it had real property (four houses in Peath) of the value of 600,000 florins, stock in trade worth 400,000 forins, and claims on tradesmen to the amount of 1,100,000 florins, the above-mentioned establishments consented to pay 1,000,000 flormis to its creditors, and to hold Its assets as security for the time being. In consequence of the foregoing arrangement, the commercial world was quieter yesterday, but the news that the Bank of England has raised its rate of discount to 7 per cent.Inwill assuredly lead to a panic on 'Change to-day. Dr. Zugschwert haa been committed for trial, and removed froma the "PolUzel. Baui" in the city to the " Criminal-Gebaude," In the suburb. The panic on 'Change to-day was fearfuL National Loan, bearing 5 per cent. interest, payable in silver, fell to 80i; Credit Bank Shares (of 200fl.) to] 196; and Northern Ratlroad Shares to 163i.

A telegram from Amsterdam, dated 14th inst., announces that on that day the Bank of Amsterdam raised its rate of discount one-half per cent.

The bankrupt had given a bMil of se to Mr. Roberw Cooke, jun., builder, of Yassall-road, Brixton, and under 'which furniture of the value of 1,2001 had been taken in execution. Of this the other creditors complained. The bankrupt, examined by Mr. NORTON, said he had been in partnership with three others in a business at SolathalL. That partnership wag diwsolved in consequence of the sudden and unexpected failure of Mr. Frederick Hale Thompson, one of his partners.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Oct. 16. (Before Mr. BLISS, Q.C., at thc GudidhaU, Wcstminster.) At the sitting of the Court this morning Tr. Maude the deputy-clerk of the peace for the county, stated that Colonel Vaughan, the clerk of the peace for the city and liberty of Westminster, had resigned that office, and the resignatiol had been accepted by the Lord-Lieutenant. The right which the Middlesex Criminal Justiee Act had conferred upon Colonel Vaughan, as clerk of the peace for the city of Westminster, of executing the office of clerk of the peace of the county when the sessions were held in Westminster had ceased in consequence of his resignation, and the whole of the duties had devolved upon Air. Beaton Ellis, the clerk of the peace for the county, whose representative he (Mr. Maune) was. This statement was ordered to be entered upon the mlnutes of the Court. John Cox was inldicted for embezzling the sum of 11. received by him on account of his master. Mr. W. J. Payne prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor was Mr. Russell, a pinc.rforte manufacturer in Brook-street, New-road, and the charge against the prisoner was that he received 164, from a lady named Atherton on account of a piano, and represented that he had received but 151. The receipt for 16Z. in his own handwriting was produced. The jury found him Guity, and Mr. BLiss sentenced him to six monthse hard labour. Thomas Chandler was indicted for stealing a quantity of oats, the property of Michael Robinson. Mr. Harwthorn prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh defended. The question in this case was whether the prisoner, who was in the service of the prosecutor, a farmer at Heston, secreted a sack of oats in his waggon with the intention of stealing or for the purpose of feeding his horses. Mir. LtIaGIl addressed the jury in support of the latter view of the matter, and The prisoner was Acquitted Mark Spain, a journeyman butcher, was indicted for stealing a piece of meat, value Is., the propertv of his master, a butcher named Broombridge, and John Roberts, a coffee-stall keeper, was indicted for receiving the same feloniously. Mr. T. Salter prosecuted- Mr. Ribton appeared for Roberts, instructed by Mr. Gilam. o The evidence made out the case against Spain, but faUed as to Roberts, who was AcquiUed. Spain was Convicd and sentenced to two months' hard labour. Henry Baxter, a boy, was indicted for stealing a watch of the value of 51., the property of a gentleman named Hart. He pleaded "Guilty."

POLICE. MAYSI0I-flUSL.-A notorious thief, named Richard Holmes, who bas for years been known to the polIce as a robber of great coats and umbrellas from offices and countinghouses, was brought up on remand, charged with having stolen four coats and a cape from the passage of the house of MIrs. G.h.. Townsend, of 3, Suffolk-lane. The proeeutrix keeps a boardinghouse for Merchant Taylors schoolboys, and on the 9th inst. an errard boy in her service saw the prisoner leaving the house in a hurried manner, with the property in question over his arm. Ha raised a cry of "S itop thieflp" and the prisoner was stopped by a constable in Thames-street with the articles inhis po6session. It was stated that on the day previous to the robbery six other COas had been stolen from the same house, beonging, also, to Merchant Taylor school-boys. The prisoner was fully ommitted for trial, and several oicers, who sid they were in a condition to prove former convictions aainsthim, were ordered to produoe records of the same at the Central Criminl Court. B Bow-sTpe T.-2Wlliam Southeron, a well-dressed lad, who said he was 19 years old, but who looks much younger, was charged with robbing his employer, Mr. Joseph Soldano, a jeweller in Henrietta-street, of 251. in gold and a couple of waLtches. A remand was applied for to complete the evidence as to the stealing of the watches. He offered no defence. Mr. JAnniyi accordingly remanded him, MLI;BBOIROUG:-STREET.-Alexander Moody, shoemaker, was brought before Mtr. Brma.&r for final examination, charged with the manshaughter of his wife, Mary Ann. Moody. The prosecution was ordered by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, in consequence of representations made to the Home-office. The case has for some weeks pastexcited a great deal of commotion In the neighbour. ood, from the fac of the deceased having been buried without an inquest, on the atthority of a certificate from St. George's Hospital that death was the result of apoplexy, and also in consequence of the refusal of the coroner to have the body exhumed in order to hold an inquest on it. Maria Appleton occupied a room 38, Grosvenor-mews, hich adjolned the house occupied by the deceased and her husband. The bedroom of the prisoner wras next to the bedroom of witness, and everything htr e in the room could be plainly heard. Saw the dececse as'T on the 17th of August. She had been drinking, but was not intoxicated. About 3 o'clock heard the prisoner come into his room. Heard him call bis wife dreadful names, and say, " Wbere have you been ? Where did you get the drink 2 Whero did you get the money ?" The deceased replied, "I did not get paid"" Witness then heard three heavy blows gven by the prisoner, and then all was silent. In the morning pr2soner called her into his room and showed her his wfe, who was lying on the bed insensible and speechless. Her face was swollen, and the right eye closed. There was paralysis of one side. The primner said he came home the previous night and found his wife beastly drunk. Wit. nees told him she heard him beating his wife durng the night. The prisoner replied he had only struck her witl his hand; he added, " he had a -- good mind to take a ha.mmer and finish her off." The prisoner afterwards said he would give the best 201. in the world if his wife's face was not in the state It was. The prisoner afterwards went out and locked his vwife in the room all day. Witness in the evening went to the window of the room, and called out, " Mary Ann, speak if you are able; will you have some ta 7" No answer being returned, a neigibour named Tnrner fetched a policeman, and the door vwas forced open. The deceased was still on the bed, and just able to speak. Some tea was made for the deceased, and witness went away. She met the prisoner shortly afterwards in Cork-street and told him a constable had broken open the door. The prisoner said he had prayed aU day that he might find his wife a corpse. She replhed, "If that had been so you would have been hung out to dry," meaning that he would have been tried for his life. The prisoner made no reply, and went home. Witness went to see deceased again, and having vashed her she told the prisoner that he had better fetch a doctor. The prisoner went out, and brought in a doctor named Trouncer, -who prescribed for the deceased, The next day the prisoner went out on a fishing excursion, Witness saw deceased every day up to the 29th of August, when she was removed to the hospitaL Heard the prisoner teU the hospital people that his wife, who, he said, vas not a drinking woman, had got a little drop of drink and had fallen out of bed. Mr. John Trouncer, surgeon, No. 6, Mount-street, was caUed in to see the deceased. Found her lying on the bed in a partially insensible state. The prisoner said he had struc his e with his open hand on coming home and finding her intoxicated. He told the prisoner that he feared greater violence had been used. The prisoner then; said he supposed his vlfe must have faUen out of bed. He attended the deceased up to the 28th of August, when sbe was removed to St. George's Hospital without his knowledge. On the 2d of September was shown a brain at the hospltal which was said to be that of the deceased. oere was effusion of blood between the membranes, which was the cause of death. The external injuries and appearances presented by the deceased when he first saw her corresponded with the state of the brain. He did not think the injuries he noticed could have been pro. duced by the deceased falling out of bed. Mr. Holmes, curator of St. George's Hospital Museum, examined the head of the deceased and found no fracture or external injury to account for the effusion on the bra"n. The brain was not injured. There was nothing to acconnt for death except the effusion. The effusion might have been caused by disease or violence. Did not give a certificate that death was occasioned by apoplexy. A certificate to that effect, he believed, had been given. Mary Turner had known the deceased for several years. Had been out with her drinking gin the night before the injury was inflicted. The deceased was not drunk that night. Had heard the deceased say she had had an apoplectic fit about eight years ago, and another attack about 16 months ago. Mr. Henry Potter, house apotbecary, St. George's Hospital, said the deceased when brought in aprcared to be labouring under apoplexy, and the prisonef caid his wife had had a fit. The post nortem appearances were those of MEr. Rogers, hospital registrar, gave a certificate of death from apoplexy, having received no intimation that the deceased had sustained vfolenec. Inspector Webb, C division, said the prisoner said the proceedings were got up against him from malice. Mr. Leadley, the chief clerL-, read over the depositions, whbich w ere of considerable length. Tne prisoner reserved his defence, and was fully come WORsSB-STREET.-Mr. Henry Hunt, of Waltham-cross Essex, coal merchant, appeared upon summons before Mr. HA3MMILL, at the instance of the Eastern Counties Railway Companyto answer a charge of wilfully placing and using a locomotive engine upon t eir line, without first obtainin the approval of the company. whereby he had rendered himself liable to a penalty of 201. Mr. HAMsILL thought the defendant had clearly brought himself within the Act. It might be true that the com. pany's engineer had reported In favour of his engine, but that was not granting a certificate, and nothing but a certificate would justify the defendant acting as he had done. Still, however, he might infer from what transpired that the privilege had been granted him, and as the Act gave the ench a discretionary power, he should reduce the penalty of 201, to one of 51., together with the costs. The costs were assessed by the clerk at 121. 9s C,d., making with the penalty 171. 9s. Gd., which the defendant immediately paid. There were also two other summonses against George Taylor and Henry Whittaker, the defendant's driver and fireman, but, as both men were supposed to be acting under their master's orders, it was agreed that they should be dismissed. CLxExxsWxLn-Richard Ceens, a dirty, ill-conditiornr lookng fellow, about 1 years ol age, was placed at the bar before Mr. Ty RurRry, charged writh setting fire to a cowshed, at 46, Mliddlesex.street, So4ers-tow4n, the property of Mr. Thomais Harris.

It appeared from the evidence of Sergeant Devitt, 32 Y that he was in the City-road about 9 in the morning when he, saw the risoners together. They went into Great Chartstreet, oxton, where the prisoners tried a door with a key. Finding themselves disturbed, they went to the end o Murray-street, where Franclin tried the door of the rector's house, which is situate at the corner; but not succeeding there they. went up Herbert-street to Church-Street, 'where Smith opened another door, the prisoner HYett and the woman standing in front of the window. Devitt, who Is a miost active officer, at the time seeing a horse and cart in Church-street, took the whip out of the cart and standing by the horse's head, heard Smith say to the others that it was allright. At this time a boycame ;up, and standing in front of the house baulked their designs, when one of them said, "Well, we are 'crabbed' now, and if I was near him I would break his nob." After that they went over the Block-bridge, and beng again followed by the constable, were seen to open another door.

This radiant apparition, attired in all the pomp and circumstance of war, was Alexis the Succulent, and the volume now before us contains the full history of his strategic operations, from the hour when he first conceived the plan of his campaign over a supper of scaUlopped oysters and a Welsh rabbit at the Albion, to the moment when his batteries de, cuisine concentrated their fire for a last repast upon Cathcart's Hill in honour of the heroes he had fed to victorv. About a hundred pages contain the strategic and practical maxims which he bequeaths to posterity, and five hundred pages record his personal adventures, so freely does he gratify the natural desire to know all about the chief hero of such memorable achievements. The preliminaries to his departure, the family group at Stafford House, the interviews with Lord Shaftesbury, Dr. Andrews, and others, we are compelled to pass over; but it is important to the world to know precisely the manner in which the preparations of so important an officer are facilitated at the WVar-office. "Well, tell me when you can start; the mail leaves at noon to-morrow. *I should be most happy to leave to-morrow, bat previous to my departure for so long and unexpected a ionrney I have some important private affirs to settle. It will therefore be sipossible. 'Ah, truly. Then I leave it to you, Soyer; but the sooner you go the better. " 'IYour lordship may depend upon my anxiety and promptitade. Not a day or even a minute shall be lost. *' IFre you well, Soyer; come and see me before your departure. *" Of course, I will; but, begging your pardon, to whom shall I address myself for any further information I may require 1 ' To myself, and no one else,' was Lord Panmure's reply. 'I should be sorry to interrupt you in the incessant business you have from morning till night. "'tMy secretary, Mfr. IRassay, will always be here; but do not hesitate, if you require it, to see me. * ' I certainly will not.'"2 On his way to the theatre of war M. Soyer had an opportunity of indicating the importance of his department of military science by a visit which he paid to the kitchen of the house at Ajaccio in which the great Napoleon was born. Here he wrote a letter upon the identical stove " which first alimented the brain of that great hero," and " on which the most delicious fish, game, meat, and poultry were, no douebt, submitted to the highest perfection of the culinary art." He inspected the oven "in which, no doubt, the cakes and choice pastry were prepared to gratify the Impeiial infant's palate," and he brought away as prized relics "a piece of tile from the stove, and a rough wooden meat-hook " which he found in the larder, " dating, as the Signora told him, from that epoch." Touching at Athens, he visited the ruins of the Parthenon, but not to moralise idly over their beauty or fate. On the contrary, as his letter of March 18 informs us, " at the present time, in the ancient Parthenon, I am cooking with my new camp-stove on a fallen capital of the stupendous ruins a petit ddjeubter a la finirciette, -with Greek and Sicilian wines, for my distinguished fellowv-travellers." A slighter man, with a less definito sense of his mission, would have mused and attitudinized over the fallen capital without perceiving its obvious applicability, but the plate which illustrates this characteristic incident, and which records the scene in indelible colours, shows that practical genius in its moments of inspiration can produce an edible result, of which the memory is equally classic. Thus, the route of Alexis may be traced by a steam of savoury odours and by succulent drippings till he reaches Constantinople and is reminded of " chicken cages" by Sultan Mahmoud's harem, and remarks the resemblance of Lord Stratford's residence to the Reform Club. After this we may desire to know what disparaging sinmilitude he found for Mount Olympus; but here at Scutari he com menced his military operations with an awful sense of the responsibilities he had himself to discharge. How entirely, said he musingly, is the history of mankind a continuation or rather a deduction from its Bill of Fare ! The great Montesquieu, followed by our own Mr. Buckle, comes virtually to this conclusion in a broad and philosophic sense, but ML. Soyer has the hardihood to push forward into particulars. " And who can say, after all, that the late destructive war was not partly, or even entirely, caused by a dinner ? Did not the French Revolution of '48 emanate from a banquet? and upon this occasion, 1854, six years after, a most unaccountable gastronomic event occurred. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, on his return to Constantinople as Plenipotentiary, had for the first time invited his Exce.- lency Prince Menachikoff to a grand diplomatic dinner, where all the representatives of the then united Courts were to assemble. The day was fixed for the 21st of March, 1854, and the invitations were cordiaUy accepted, most especiaUy by the representative of the C7ar, he being, no doubt, anxious to read upon the brow of the diplomatist the political feeling of his nation. 'Fhat very day, towards noon, the Sultan's mothor died. In the morning she had written a letter to his Excellency expressive of her f all confidence that he would study the future welfare of her son in his relations with the British Government. On account of this mournful event, and with a most profound feeling of respect and veneration for the Imperial mourner, the dinner was postponed for a week; and while the dark veil was laid over the banqueting table and the black seal was set upon the bua-erie dc cuisine, and numerous 7,ouchcs et fcu dc I'Ambassaade Brito nnique, hls Excellency Prince Menschikoff was on board a Russian man-of war anchored at the mouth of the Black Sea, waiting, with all the dignity and defiance imaginable, for the determination of peace or war. The diplomatic banquet never took place ! The wvar did! "4 I consider a postponed diplomatic dinner to be an unlversal calamity, especially when only a few hours' notice of the postponement is given; and I cannot but quote the caatrosomie Reaene,oeor, page 342, published in the year 1842, in which I say- '- *Rien ne dispose mieux l'esprit humain ai des transactions amicales qua'un dicer bien conin at artisteluentpr6par6. iasez P'histoire. et voas y trouverez quo, dan tons les temps et chez tons les peolples, le hien qui s'est fait, at quelquefois le mal, fut toujours precedde oa suivi d'an copioux The last is a safe averment, but it is a characteristic of the Regenerator that he sometimes forgoes his loftier pretensions and conde9cends to a simple hash or a platitude like the rest of uls. The importance of his art needs no testimonial, and yet we find him in conversationwith a sympathetic friend bandy- ing to and fro " the celebrated Leilmjitz." As " one of the greatest atuthorities of the agt" (and whose Treatisc vpqut the Chymistry of Food we assuine to have supplanted Liebig's), yet turning "the celebrated Leibnitz" to no higher acconut than to represent on his testimony the regenerative art as a mere " i2smtinct which has almnost reached the dig- nity of conscious knowledge." We caunot permit the su)erb Alexis in a moment of weal.aens to do himself,his art, and achievements this injustice. The dignity of conscious knowledge was not only C" almost," it was perfectly, exhibited in the kitchens at Scutari when he hiruself contrasted his savoury products with those he had superseded, wihen he proved to the Orderlies that the water in which meat has been boiled is a broth, and that that broth is not improved in strength or flavour by boiling in it old buttons, rags, and scissors, or even by the addition of " a pair of old snuffers." In the dignity of conscious know- ledge he had the cooking apparatui cleaned; Coppers were tinned and ovens were built; cieanli- hOYer's (Uutmzart' Uampaitn ; being Historical Reminiscences of the late War, with the Plain Art of Cookery for Military and Civil Institutions, the Army, Navy, Plublic, &c. By Alexis Soyer, &c. RoutLedge, LS57. Xless superseded slovenliness, uand economy followed vwaste; a discreet hand was dipped into the salt-box and a sagacious palate 'dicerned for the uneducated the proper quantities and proportions of the most salu'-ary ingredients. In the dignity of conscious knowledge a trial was submitted to out of which the regenerator came triumphant, with his knowledge fully recognized, with this well-earned remark from General Vivian on leaving the kitchen in which these wonders had been conssiously performed, "MonsIeur Soyer, Miss Nightingale's name and your own wiUl be for ever associated in the archives of this memorable war." Nevertheless, this very artist in whom we trusted, and who thus justified our confidence, we now learn to our astonishment was so unnerved previous to the trial visit of the kitchen authorities that he was obliged to apply to Dr. Macgregor for medicine to clear his head. Be was aware, as he says, that his grand opening was a bold experiment, "for had I failed-and many unforeseen events might have caui-sed such a result-my reputation wsd have sffered. I was therefore well aware that I was risking the labour of 2Oyears against an uncertainty." But when once this uncertainty was decided in his favour he appears to have had no further misgiving, and all his enterprises henceforth were crowned with a steam of glory. From Scutari he passed to the Crimea, where his field stoves came into operation, and where he himself presided at a grand review of his artiUlery. The reader who wishes to see how he looked on that occasion may turn to page 356, and for a larger presentment of his person and apparel to the page immediately preoeding his introduction. There stands the genius of that fateful epoch, splendid and serene amid the tumult and glare of the battlefield. A complication of accessories again surrounds him,and gives to his operations a confused import. Is he considering the bunch of carrots at his feet or musing over the soup bucket that is borne to the perilous trench behind him ? In what way is the Orderly at his elbow affording him assistance, and what are those spherical objects he is handling ? Are they cannonballs to be stowed into cannon broth, or Dutch cheeses about to be fired from a mortar ? Again the culinary and combative emblems are so mixedthat our judgment is perplexed and we stumble over our history. After trying in vain to clear our recollections, we come to the conclusion that Raglan and Pelissier were chefs de ciisite, and that it was General Soyer who performed the flank march, who commanded at Inkermann, who stormed the Mala-koff, and blew up SebastopoL lVe have no difficulty under these circunistances in understanding that Lord Raglan should term him "r one of his great benefawtors," that "no less than 800 or 1,000 persons of distinction" should visit him on the day of his grand levde, and that ,General Windham should write on the 8th of September, 1855 :-" I had the pleasure after my return from leading the storming party of the 2d Division of the Redan of dining with Colonel D. WVood and meeting at dinner Mylonsieur Soyer." WVe are again puzzled when we find the trophies he | brought away from Sebastopol, the Sebastopol he had conquered, consisted of " a long iron fork, a ladle, someof the dough, biscuits, and a large piece of the black bread taken from the oven." There I must be evidently some mistake, and Soyer the Great, like the heroes and demigods of ancient nythology, must be a sort of concrete of several parties with their attributes and histories rolled into one. Here, for example, we have him as the fountain of Honour:- 'R Before leaving the battery I begged Miss Nightingale, as a favour, to give me her hand, which she did. I then requested her to ascend the stone rampart next the wooden gun cariage, and lastly to sit upon the centre mortar, to which requests she very gracefully and kindly acceded. 1 then boldly exclaimed, I Gentlemen, behold this amiable lady sitting fearlessly upon that terrible instrument of war. Behold the heroic daughter of England, the soldier's friend P' All present shouted, 'Bravo! bravo ! Hurrah! hurrah ! Long live the daughter of Eogland !"' And here we have hin as the Minister of Peace:- "' ITaUo, captain!' I exclaimed, 'whatever has brought you on board at this time of night ? I"C' I will tell you. They have sent for you from headqularters, and you have been sought in al directions. Captain Ponsonby has been looking everywhere for you. A grand djeilner is to be given to-morrow in honour of General luders' visit, I happened to hear of it where I dined, and knowing the Alar had returned with you on board I have come to inform you that your aid is required. By the by, you were suspended a long time this morning between wind and water. I made so sure you could not hold on much longer that I had one of my sailors ready to junmp over and pick yonu " ' Thanks, captain, for two eminent services in one day. t cannot, however, o head-quarters till morning, as I have no pony at Balaklava. "'All right,'said he. 'Call upon Major Ross in the mornina ; he will let you have all you require. 'At daybreak I wiUl be there.' "M'ind, the lunch is to be ready at 2 o'clock.' 'I shall not be able to assist much, as there will hardly be time to turn round. However, good-night, captain, and a thousand thanks.' * I I'm off in a few hours for Constantinople,' he caUed out from his boat,' and shaU be back in a week. Goodbye.' " The sentinels, as usual, cried, ' All's well.' I must say I did not think it was all well with me. ' What can I do.' said I to myself, 'for an event of historical importaucei' ?,either Mr. Crockford nor the captain could assist me, when an idea struck me:-' If you can't get me an idea,' said I to my friends, 'at any rate lend me a dish.' "'That I wilL' said the captain. " 'Recollect, I want a large one. "'You had the largest for your salad yesterday.' "'That one will do; it will hold enough for 2S persons.' 'Then here goes,' said I, writinr. ' To-day I shall dress in it the rUacedoinc Liiderscinne t' Alerandr-e It.' "'A very good name in honour of the event,' said Mr. Crockford. 'But pray, of what is it to be comosed ?' " ' Oh! for that,' said I, 'if I were to employ the Genius of Gastronomy, from LnucUus to Apicius and Vitellius, or XVatel to Ude and Car6me, I could get nothing from them but Inspiration, while what I require is something substantial and not arti6eial. It strikes me that a word from you to your head man at Kadik-oi (as you will not be there to-morrow) would do more for me in a few minutes than the whole of those defunct celebrities, whom I am not now incEned to trouble upon so material a subject. Pray give me carte blanhde to get anything you may have and I require for the composition of this modern Babylon, which must be constructed on a base sufficiently strong to resist the joint attack of the heads of three of the most powverful armies in tne world, snd only be destroyed affer having conquered the conqueror's place d'caru-c, the stomach, so called in military parlance.' ' The order was readily given by my friend Mr. Crockford, ard we then lay down to sleep, being both completely exbausted with the fatigues of what was called a day of pleasure. We had hardly closed our eyelids when morning caused them to be reopened; so up we got. My friend started for Constantinople and I for head-quarters. On my way I called upon Major Ross, who kindly lent me a pony and told me of the message left with him. I started immediately, bought a few things in Balaklava market, called at Crockford's store at Donnybrook, which I ransacked and despoiled of condiments of every description. Instead of going direct to head-quarters I changed my mind and went home to prepare, having decided, as the time was so shorc. to produce one good dish only instead of several small and insignificant ones. This was, however, to be worthy of the ocoasion. I was well aware that General Codrington's cook, under the liberal management and command of Captaiu Ponsonby, would turn out something worthy of the event. tp,7u arriving at my hut I sent two of my cooks to assist him, despatched my groom on horseback to Kamiesch for various things, and then begun the construction of my Lid-ersienne upon the lid of my new field stoves, the dish I had brought from the Alar being too smaL "M My novel dish was completed, and carried to headquarters by two soldiers, and at a nuarter to 2 I personally placed my culinary wonder upor; the table. It was called 'Soyer's Culinary Emblem of Peace, the Afacdoine Lidersienne a' I rander II.' This monster dish was com- posed or 12 boxes of preserved lobsters, 2 cases of preserved lampreys, 2 cases of preserved sardines, 2 bottles of pre. served anchovies, 1 ease of preserved caviar, I case of preserved sturgeon, 1 case of preserved thunny, 2 cases of preserved oysters, llb. of fresh prawns, 41b. of turbot clout6, 12 Russian pickled cucumbers, 4 bottles pickled olives, 1 bottle mixed pickles. 1 bottle Indian ditto, 1 bottle picklfd French beans, 2 bottles pickled mushrooms, I bottle pickled mangoes, 2 bottles of pickled French truffles, 2 cases of pre. served neas, 2 cases of preserved mixed vegetables, 4 do7en cabbage lettuces! 100 eggs, and 2 dozen of preserved cockscombs. The sauce was composed of six bottles of salad oil, one of Tarragon vinegar, half a bottle of Chili vinegar, two boxes of preserved cream (whipped), four ounces of sugar, six eschalots, salt, cayenne pepper, mustard, and a quarter of an ounce of Oriental herbs which are quite unkno,wn in 4 * e * * *, "Professionally I was doubly proud of tbe honour of continbuting my mite of industry to this California of grandeur and great events. My monster Alac6doine was placed in the centre of the table, and, though only a few persons were present, was much admired. ' In a few minates,' said I to myself, ' those great men whose names are echoed and re-echoed throughout the world by the trumpet-blast of fame will be here, not only gazing upon my impromptu chef-d'musiTre, but I hope also freely partaking of it, and, while enjoying the pleasures of the table, cementing the sentiments of peace and of friendship." How the Mac6doine was attacked and how it sustained the attack, how Pelissier found the olive stones too hard for him, and how the prompt Soyer saved his honour by his ready wit, must be looked for in the book itself. We can only add that General Soyer, with his compound functions, is nerertheless a consistent personage, except where, possibly from his wanting a little medicine, he Jorgets for a moment that he is the cenitre of creation,
I 1" TBLEGRAM VERSUS TELEGRAPH." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-With all deference to Mr. Shilleto, I can detect no "barbarism" in the new addition to our family of letters. If r77A signifies " afar," or " from afar," and ypdapEtv " to write," or " to communicate," then the verb rrjXeypabscv is formed aecording to the very strictest analogy of language. Assuming the verb to stand, then rrqXi-ypaooc would be " the person who so writes or communicates," r-7Xe-ypa+t., or r7;Xs-ypa04 (for both forms of inflection oocur), would denote " the act of writing from afar," and r71V-ypappa '" tele-gramma," " telegram," would signify "the message so sent," as being the neuter passive substan. tive derived from the verb. Nio one, of course, who is familiar with his Greek gram mar would think of being so "barbarous"as to use the word r7AXe-ypa(qieoc, for substantives of an active signification derived from verbs in sEiv never take that form ; but the passive, new-born, ri'Xi-ypaiLpa, I would still maintain, is precisely according to the analogy of jueoie-ypappa, (monogram), dui-yp-zjtpa (diagram), &c. ; and I fancy it is a word which would often have been heard issuing from the lips of Demosthenes had the electric telegraph been laid down in his days from the Pir.,us to Macedonia. At all events, I am surprised that Mr. Shilleto, as a " first-clas, man of Cambridge," should suggest the superior correctness of " telegrapheme" (TrA,s-yp60,jpa), which eould only be derived from yopaeiw, not from ypapw. In conclusion, let me remind the anti-telegram party, even if they stUIl dispute the strict analogy on whioh " telegram" is based, that it is quite competent to society at large to invent new terms to express the ever-changing ideas and wants of an age of " progress," aceording to the old Horatian adage, which speaks of "g cnitov UwS," and which declares quite apropos of the present controversy,- "Icuit semperque licebit "ISignatum pnwsento notft proeudere nomen."

I THB SUPPOSED MURDER. The efforts of the police to disoover a clue to the perpe; trators of this atrocious crime bave thus fhr been whoU3l unsuccessful. Inquiries were made yesterday with referenceto the statements oontained in the letter addressed by Mr. Richards, chief officer of police at Stafford, to Superin_ tendant Derkdi,, a copy of which appeared in Thc Tmes of yesterday. It has been ascertained that 31r. Patterson, th person mentioned In that letter, after his arrival in Londonf. from Stafford, transacted some business with Messsrs. Roman, of 25, Skinner Street, and left London for Glasgow on the, 15th of September, with the view of visiting his father. Superintendent Durkin has communicated with the Glsgowpolioe on the subject, but from the descriptions obtained or Ksr. Pattersonxs dress it appears to have differed in severat, material respects from the clothing contained in the carpet bag discovered at Waterloo-bridge. As imputations of apathy or negligence In the conduot; of their investigations have been thrown upon the polioe im certain quarters, it is but just to stat that, u we have. reason to know, it would be almost impossible to exceed theindefatigable efforts of the police officers, under the direction. of Mr. Durkin, to penetrate the mystery In which theb occurrenoe is at present involved. The slightest circumstances which might lead to a trace of the criminals are. investigated with such despatch and care as woould surprise those unacquainted with the vigilance of the detective. police.
THE FATAL SOUTH WALES RAILWAY COL, LISION. NEATE, FanmY. The occurrence of the fearful collision of two paasengee - trains on the South Wales Railway on Wednesday, as reported in yesterday's Times, has caused an immense deal of excitement in the district5 on account of the terrible natreof the casualty, and the peculiar circumstances under whiohl it occarred. The most exaggerated reports have been Circa- lated as to the extent of the casualties, bat, bad as the fact. are, they are happily not so bad as had been represented. We reported in Thursday's Tims that one child had been kllled. and that a number of wounded hadbeen conveyedi to Swansea Infirmary. One of these, Mr. Ashman, a pork batcher of. Cardiff, was found on the arrival of the train at Swnsea to' have died on the journey, and a second, an elderly woman, expired on the same night. Her Injuries were in. ternal, and she did not appear to have received any externali wounds. Mr. Ashman was on his weekly journey to attend Neath market when the accident occurred. A sum of 504. was found in his possession. Their bodies await an inquest. at Swansea. MIr. Cathbertson, coroner for Glamorganshire, opened thenquest on the body of the child Sarah Ann HaIrman at the. Towfn.hal here yesterday afternoon, and after viewing the body the coronerand jury proceeded in a special train to the spot wrhere the cosHson took place. The uninjured car riages of the two trains had in the meantime been removed, and the engines and tenders, or at least some portionsof their Xemains, and of the fragments of the wreck, rem&ained upon the line. It Is a remarkable and providential circumstanee ,bat notwithstanding the violenca of the shock of the meet. ing trains none of the carriages left tie rails. Had they done so the consequences would have been arwful, as at this spot the railway runs along a high embankment, with a small river running beneath. the up.train consisted of the. engine (the Bellona) and tender, twro third clasacarriages next ihe tender, one second class, one first lass carriage, and a. auard's van. The down-train was made up as follows Engine and tender, twso third class carranges, two necon& class, a horse-box, and carriage on a truck. The first of the third class carriages in the down-train had been forced nnder the tender, which had crushed in the top nd sides of the carriage, as if it bad been snde of paper, cattering the wood and Ironwork over the line. The ist of the thary class carriages of the up-train was lsot smashed nealy to the same extent th e wheeos he engines and first of the carriages were broken and lay under the Wreck; the boiler of one of the engines was broken, and the hot water ran over the line, while many of the pieces of timber were smeared with human blood. After viewving the spot, and receiving some explanation from the officials, the coroner and jury heturneu to Neath, and the inquest was adjourned to this day at II o'clock. The fohlowingesitnesses e ere then exaniined .- John WilLs. tucle to the deceased Sarah Aun Harmanc deposed that she was the daughter of William Harman,tfarirr (ailiff of Bridgend, and aas foar years and three months'old. On Wednesday morning witness accompanied her and herat from Neath to Briton Ferry in*a third-dsss ca r- riage. Witness left the train at Briton Ferry, nd thede ceased and her aunt proeteded on their journey to Bridh end. In the in t deceased as brought back dead. Her aunt ras injured, and unable to attend to give evidence. or. James Pink, one of the passengers in the down-train (wdho had his head baneaged, and appeared to have received some injuries) deposed that he got into the train at Pyle atn 25 minutes past 10 o'clock, and after waiting a fewr minuteeg the passengers were informed that a goods train In. advance on the same line had broken down, and that they must wait. After waiting about an hour he nsked the stationmaster to take bock his fivket, whi h he said he would, but w itness afterwards decided to wait h litte longer, and shortly after the guard blew the whistle for the passengers to resume their seats, .and e then got intot t erain again, whch was backed to Stormy station - and, after some signals between the guard and a man stationed at Stormy, they got on the up line and proceeded owa the journey dowin past Pyle on the up line. Passed Pyle station at about 6fve minutes to 12. Shortly after (said the witness) I heard tho "danger" signal (the whistle sounded for the guard to put on the breaks), and immediaaely afterwards the collision took pslace. On recovering myself I was satting in the widdle of the carriage, the train beine g at a stand. My head and eye iero much cot and bleeding. I got out of the carriage and wvent towrds the engine, and the first Person I spoke to was the driver of our engine, who rid, * lb ave a written order " (to go on the up line), and took out some paper to show me, but I wa3S m too confused a state to read it. The aitness went on to say that he went round to look at the shfferers, andamong tham he considered there wvee some hopeless cases. He advised a fellowt-passengh r to w;alk idth him to Pyle and fetch a surgeon. He saw th0 body of the child lying on the embankment of the railw;ay By the Jnry.-To the best of his knohledge She stationmaster at Pyle gave the order to stopeh to rain, Could not tell who gave the order to hack. Did not recollect the train stopping at Pyle station on the journey along the up line.. It proceeded slowly until it had passed Pyle the secondi Martin Langdon, police inspector on the South Tales Rail;ay, and stationed at Swansea, deposed, that at a quar ter to 1 o'clock he henrd that the 6.30 train from Chelten. ham had passed Stormy at 11.5. Port Taibot station iaslthen telegraphed to, andyreplied that theltrainhadnot leached there at 12M5. It WaiS due at Port Talbot at 10.25 I reptorted the circumstance to dir. Clarke, the genera! superintendent, who desired me to see the Swansea station-. master, and request him to telegraph to 1Neath to send a yard engine to seek the train immediately. ienore the messageo could boe gt off Mr. Clarke deternined to have out a special train and proceed to the spot. On reaching Port Talbot at about a quarter past 2 they learnt that a collision had taken place between the n.5 up-train and 6.30 down-train, about a .ile and a-half from Pyle. While 3ir. Clarke was in conversation with Mr. Turner the stationmaster at Port Tlhot, he saw a train coning in the dir.ection of Pyle, on the down line. This train brought the injured pasengers to Port T albot, and he was directed by hr. Clarke to forward them to Swansea and do all that was necessary. They started for Swansea at about 2.45, and on arrivinz at Briton Ferry, several persons slightly injured alighted. They the-n proceeded on to N'eath, and, knowiing that the aunt of the deceased, who was in the train, was dangerously hurt, he directed the body to be removed without her knowledge. lnew at Swansea before he heard of the collision that an obcstruction had arisen between Pyle and Port Talbot on the line, which had caused the downtrain to stop, but did not know the nature of the obstruction until he had arrived at Port Talbot, when he learne that the Irish goods tridn had left a numbber of truckh on the down line in consequence of ant axle of one of the trucks breaking, and that the stationmaster at Port Talbot had telegraphed to Stermy to stop any trais By Xr.
