Therest of the canvass was very favourable; and several of the Liberal party and of the Roman Catholic gentry promised their support There was a great change on the Tuesday, and a greater on the Wednesday. Mr. Smith then corroborated the account given by the previous witnese as to the acene at the nomination, stating that both he and Mr. Jordan met with a bad reception. After the nomination he made a oommunication to Captain Moore, as chairman of his committee, requesting him to retire, on the ground that life would be lost if he went to the poll. Witness added that if life were lost he should never be able to enter the town again. The more he had reflected on the matter sine the election the more convinced was he of the prudence of the decision of the coamittee. When that decision was communicated to Captain Moore he wrote a note to the chairman of Mr. 3M'Cann's committ announcing his retirement.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE; HOUSE OF LOSDS, Mo"Ay, AUGUST 3. Lord MONTEAGLE presented a petition from Portst mnouth against the Mersey Coneoreny Bill. EMBODIMENT OF THE MILITIA, Lord PANMtRE rose and said,-I beg to presest to your lordhips a Bill to enable the Government to embody the militia (hear, hear) between this and the 25th of March next without having to call Parliament together on that embodiment taling place. It would not have been necessary to present this Bill to the Rous if itb had not been that the law requires that on the embodimean of the miii Parliament, if not sitting, should be summoned within 14 days. Ia the pent ste of affairs it does not appear de. atrable to the Government to compel Parliament to meet during the reces The GoverAment always have it in their own power to call Parliament together if a necessity should arise, and if this were a Bill to enable the ombodiment of the m5iltia to take place on the occaon of a war with a, foreign country it would be absolutely necessary for the Government to cal Parliament together. There seems; to be an impression that the Government require aome special power to enable them to embody the Militia, My lords, the Government require no power whatever for that purpose, provided that they axe prepared to Meet Parliament within a certain time after that embodi. mrent haa taken place. The position of the subject is this: -Previously to the year 1854, as your lordships are aware, the militia of this country could only be embodied upon the expectation of an insurrection, or upon the invasion of the countzy itself; but in that year Parliament paswed a Bill to enable the oountry to have its militia embodied in the event of a war with aforeign country. Neither of thoseexigean. vles exists at present; but a state of things does prevail ia our exstern possessions which occasions as great a draia upon the resouroes of this oountry as if we we-re at this time carrying on a foretgn war. It is necessary, therefore, to upply the VAcuUM whichl is created by the demand In India for forces from this country. In order to do that the Government have determined in the fist place to raise 10 newr battalions to supply the place of those that have alredY left this country, and they have also determined to rAIs0 the ba'talions of the regiments at home from 84O rank and fil t 1,00, ad4 to raise those In India from 1,000 to 1,200. All that, however, can be done without going beyond the powers of the present Mutiny Act, which provides that the charge for regiments going to India shall fel upon the revenue of the East India Company, and not upon the revenue of the Imperial Treasury. But it will take time, especially at this season of the year, to raise those additional men; and, therefore, during that period, while our country is to a certain extent being drained of its troops, while our garrison duties require to be performed and while our posi. tion must be maintained in the face of foreign nations, it may be necessary to call out and to embody certain rei. ments of militia, from which it is no exaggeratio;m to say that we may expect to derive the same good service that we should derive from a similar number of regiments of the line. (Hear, hear.) It is 1nnecessary for me to recall to the recollection of your lord. ships the services wksch have been performed by the militia upon their embodiment on former occasions; but I am certan tht at this moment it would be quite possible to embody militia regiments which should do the garrison and ether duties of this country altogether as efflioiently as regi. 2cents of the line, and which -would be able satifaWtorily ta take the places of those regiments in the resent emergency. We shall not exercise the power which this Bill gIV u unles it shall appear to th overnment to be necessary to do so; but if it shall so ap'ar it il be exercised, and my noble friend at the heado the Government will lay upon the table of the other House to-night an estimate for 10,0 . to provide for the expenses of any regiments that may be embodied between this time anrd the 25th of March next. With these few observations I beg leave to present the Bill for first reading, feeling confident that there will be no objections raised to it on the part of any of your lord. ehips. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of HARDWIOKE.-I wish to say a very few words upon this ocoasion, becaue I think that the Governmnent have Again exhibited that remarikable faculty of being a little late in their announcements with respect to warlke operations which we on this side of the House have so frequently felt ourselves called upon to criticize. Precisely the same thing tcok place thr.ou6ot the last war; they were always a little too late. (Hear, hear.) Of course, we judge very nmuch of the energy of the Government by the promptitude whioh they display in carring out operations Of magnitude and importance; and It will, no dout, be re. membered that immnediately upon the arrival of the first distrous news from India we who sit -6 on the ODPOSi. tion side of the Hfouse recommended that the militia should be embodied, and that aU the disposable troops at our command should be sent to India. (Hear, hear.) But it was said, " Ob, no. This is a matter of smal i Iportance; we wnt nothlug of the sort;" and the very day after that occurrence I received a circular letter from the Secretary at War, stating that the miiti would not be wated for dill or exercise during the present year. (Htear, hear.) I DuSt say, then, that if we Are to judge of your foresight and Imowledge and power to wield the arms of this ceun try from what has already occurred we have a rht to s that you are tardy in your, operations, that you rejected alto. tether advice in the first instancewhichwewerebefore. and with you in recommending, and that you have been compelled to act at last, ea poa ought to have do be at first, with an amount of vigour aud energy which acrisis u- aralleled in the history of the countrKy appeas to me to call for.I venture to mnake these remarks in vindication of what isas been said upon this sideofd the House, and of the prompt and energetic measures wFhich we from thecoemniencement thought it to be our duty to urge upon you. (HIear, hear.) Earl GRIAN IZl.-lNo doubt, the noble earl who has just st down has a perfect right to criticize the measures of the Government, and no doubt aso it is much easier to criticise than to act. (Hear.) At the sametime, I do not think that the Government are open in the slightest degree to the attack which has been made upon them by the noble earl. The suggestion which VFss made on the other side of the Hlouse upon the receipt of the first news from India was that the mllitia should be imrnediatelf embodied; but I t thatthatwouldhave'beeavery b advice to have adopted in the middle of the hay harvest, and of course before the beginning of the corn harvest. There would have been geat difnoulty experienced in embodying the mUitia at that time; it would have taken men awa from moet use. ful and profitable employments, and it vould have given an unpopuLarity to the measure which it was most desirable tc avoi (Hear, hear.) The Government never stated that they Would not embody the militia if they should consider the step necessary, but they reserved to themselves the power of judging of the importance of the news as it arrived, and of devising such measures from time to time as they might deem essentiaL I cvn see no disadvantage which Las resuted from the delay which has taken place in pro posing this measure, but I can see great advantage in having taken our own time to mature our plans, instead of acting suddenly upon the advioe of any noble lord who jumps up on the spur of the moment, and who offers suggestions without having the responsibility of carrying them into execution. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY.-My noble friend near me did not complain that the Government had not followed the advice of a particulzr noble lord, or had not embodied the militia in Jy, vwhich probably would have been an unfavourabl, time for the purpose; but he suggested that the Govern, mnet had come very lately to a conclusion far different fror that at which they had arrived a short time ago. Towards the end of June an order in Councl was agreed to by wbiclj You sgnified to the lord-lieutenauts of counties that there would be no calling out of the militia in the present year, nd I believe that that order in Council was not uromul. gated until late in the mornth of July, by which time events had taken such a turn that it mLust have been mannifest to everyone but to the menmber, of the Government that it was morethan probablethat there would he an Urgent necessity in the course of the year for calling out the militia. Now, at the last Moment thea Government, having given that public notice to militia officers and others that their services would not be required In the ,p:eent year, find themselves compelled to take powers tor embodying the militia, and to intimate pretty Clearly the existence of A strong imrsinothrpas that the services of the militia will bP ressuirn on their parts t impression being strengthened by the annotmcemenet thtin the other House an estimate wil hseeigh presen tedo forwthat nurpose. I do not com plain of the cou r, n2ow takenL by the Government ; I only think that they might have seen the necessity of adopting it somewhat rooner. (Hlear, hear.) Lord PANMtJRE.-The noble earl has altogether mis. comprehended the object of the pres hBill; butlet me observe, in the first Place, that the Goernmethvo changed any views which they ever had on the sub- jec; ad i th seondplae tat they have not ierferedd with theordderPin Councoil to which he ha eere.I anteoinino-h ovrmn,a consequence they dispensed w ith further traini in the case otose eregIment. The Bill whieh I have presented to the House th is evenin g does not at all referztoteu resent time. It is simuly intended to give pow er to the ( ovorn. m ent to do that wh en Parliamen t is not sittin g wh ich they nave full power to do at this mo ment. d s not tr t they shall call out the m litia; bttd n gthprvidet the time may ome when that may be -- sy,i itis to meet such an emergency, and to save the necessity of P=arlment meeting again within a fortnight, if, after the prorogation, the militia were to be called out. It is merely to giv e to the Government the power of doing that after Parliament rises w hich they could do now that Parliament is bitting. I think that the Government might be permitted to take steps for enabling them to embody the militia when Parliarment is not sitting if they should see fit without being exposed to the charge that all their meaures are taken after the proper time. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DEBY- am I 't aware that thae o bject of theBil isto nale he ove.jmntto do that which a doin. (Alauh.) ed hat heyhad no inxtenton of Lord PiANMURE.-No; that is no so. o The Bill was then read a first time. PAHLIAMFNTAAY EEFORM. Lord BEOUGHAM4 in rising to maove for an electoral reur of wkich hie hda given notice, said th a , recolle cting tbhe ahue he h hsd In the great measure of 1 831-2 , h e hought it had become his duty to state one or tvo of the elrcutaiances connected with that Bil, , ad to daw the t#-rntion o f I is noble f i4* d jW MO Go Tern ment to Its re- sults. The Government had announced that It was their intention next session to preernt a Bill of Parlimentary Rteform. A measure would consequently be introduoed tffecting some chonge in the exsting system of representa. tion. Now, there w great difference between the ircaumstances of the country at the present moment and in 1830, -when the necessity for reform was believed to have arin.' It was then aid that there was no feeling is this country ur favour of reform, and hwa repetedly t-rted with never having heard the aubject mentioned in the courge of bis recent canvas of Yorkshi, though mauch had been said about slaver and the French revolution. He could not deny the truth of this remark, bht, then, how grievouly mistaken 'were those who thought the san. ject devdt ITo sooner had he given bin notice, 'which he did on the very frat night of the sessdon, than all Yorkshire, end (very soon afterwards) all England thought for some months of nothing ese. This wva owiDg not merely to hls notice but mainly to the echnge in the Govermnent which then took place and the announoement that tht Governmeut vas aboutto prepare a BiL It was said that upon the present occasion the like announcement would produce the same effect. He grs-ely doubted it, however. The great excitement which prevailed in behalf of reform in 1830.1 was owing to the long rponement of tha q,uestion, the refuml ever to cousi er it, the Duke of Wellmgton's deelaration that the present system was so perfect that if a new oonstitution had to be formed he thould wish to base it on the same principles, the total 'want of representation In the great towns, the abuses of rotten boroghs. These end other grievances were so enormous mnd unbearable that reform, it was felt, could no longer be delayed, and the countty, therefore, was bent on a large measure. Nor, he would not say that Lord Pahnerston's announcement might not have some effect in creating a disposition in favour ot reform; butthatit would produce anything like the feeling existing in 1831 he entirely denied. Se certainly thought that great defects existed fi the Bill of 1832, and he had no manner of douht that some of those defects might be sa£ely as well a ey remedied. Were he to state his own opinion on the subject, however, it would he that the preposed m;easure should he confined to the remoral of those defects rather than to the introduction of any general or s'weep stcheme of Parliamentary reform. He denied that te Bill of 1832 was a fat. Lure- he denied the assertion that it was tither revolutionary or had revolttionary tendencies. He denied also that the Reform Bill was a mock sneasure of reform. It was a very large measure of reform. He did not like to mention names, but some of its strongest supporters, though not of the Government, who were mego pealous Reformers, inclined to the opinion that it went rather too far. The defenoe of the Reform Bill was to be fonad iu the conduct of those who in this metropolis stood on the side of lawr and order on the 10th of April, 1848. Had tht Bill nwer passed into law that, day would not have pamsed over our heads in the quiet, peaceable, and even tranquil maer in which it was well remembered to have passed. It might be that the machinery set up by thut BDI had not produced goods so excellent as might have been wished. He was far from holding that opinion; but he would say lnothing upon that part of the subject beyond this-that the House of Commons, as at preset tonatitute, 'well deserved the confidence of the county. While the Rieform Bill sassing throgh Parlement he endeavouredto remedy innevi lhich then existed and still continued to eismt wth regard to our Parliamentar system-d., the nevsiy of a re-election in the case of office being conferred bthe Coln upon amteher of the Eouse of Commons. He preposed to do away with that necessity,sat all events, in the cae of a lember being merel promoted from one ofieod to another. Bat his proposal wmas not adopted. The evilsof that, sytei were soon seen after the palsing of the Reform BiD, for ail the measures tendian to improve our jurisprudenoe (introduced in the tession 9x 13 were altogeher suspehded on account of the ato tyhGeneral failing to be returned after vspctitg his seat on hms promotion from the office of Souliitor. General. He proposed th ththere should be of6dal xeats in .he House of bCmmons without votes. That, he believed, 'was the practice in all other countries having a Parliament Repugnance to it wms confined to this country. He might mention that Lord Grey and Lord Ak orpe thadno doubt 'whatever that the first-m entioned *emedy 'with respect to official members of the House of Commons would be n improvement, although they had doubts as to the other remedy. He objected to that part of the Reform Bill wrhich necessitated an annual revision of the lists of voters It might be said that that revision was necery for the sake of the poll, at which it vras of importance to have the means of knowing who had a right to vote. It was necessar, it mighti be said, that the voters should come year by year before the revising barristier, beca use e. ma 'who had on oo been a 10l. householder might, since his name ws put on the regisEbr, have become the occupant of an 81. or a i1. tenemnent. But the very fact of that man having beenl once a 101. householder proved his respectability, and he should therefore like to see this principle adoptod by the next Reform Bill-once a voter always a voter. A good deal of improvement might also be made with respect to that portion of the prenat sytem with respect to revising barristers. He had very great objection to the manner in whioh they were appointed. It vwas always bad to gi:ve patronage to judges. It was bad to the judges themselvee, to the profession generaUy, and to those persona whom they selected. It was supposed that favour rather than professional merit guided that selection. He 'would much rather see the patronage dispensed by the Home Department than by the judges Another defect in the Reform BiU was that portion which related to freemen. That put of the Bill was a concesion to some members of t'Lt UVU-LV of Oms0co,w .ho e site6. light have retarded its progress He thought it ms u:fortunate that the 'whole of the freemen's votes were zot abolished. They were not the best voters in any respect; in some respects they were the worst, and generally speaking corruption prevailed more among that than allthe other clamse of voters Among the most respectble of the voting clas were the skilled artisans of this country-men of great merit, in. telligence, and education, many of them possessed of great scientifie knowledge, and all of them, with hardly an exception, endowed with abilities and talents which zen derek them very valuable to their employers. Them men were also, by reason of their talents and skill, among the most independent portion of the community, and more independent, m fact, of their masters than their masters were of them. In 99 instances out of 100 these artisans raised no cry for the ballot; indeed, they generally treated that cry with oontempt, and indignantly disclaimed aniy desire to conceil their vote But in this great town, and in the manufacturing towns, many of theserespectable artisaus, not occupying 101. houses, or being only lodgers, woere excluded from the constitueney. if, therefore, any means could he devised which, without too muchloweringthe franchise, would extend the suffrage to a larger number of this class, the electoral system would be much benefitted, and a consummation devoutly to be wished would be attained. Some persons had recommended that there should be a reduced franchise with a greater length of residencefor example, that a residence of one year only should be required from the ocoupant of a 104.-house, while one of two years from the occupaut of a 61.-house. With this might be combined tns Pnrciple already described of '- once a voter always a voter., Another test 'which had been sug. gested was that of education, to be applied by means of an examination in the elementary branchels of knowledge. But another proposition was to confer an educationaL fran. chise, without an examination, on clergymen, medical men, retired officers of the amy and navy, literary men, and men having Universitv degrees, or belonging to scientific bodies. The suggestion was that theee persons should be gouped into classes, and allowed to return a member from different parts of the country; without, however, losing their previous right to vote as householders where they occupied houses. It was proposed that about 70 members should be chosen by these " classe," an equivalent number of seats being provided for the purpose by getting rid of the objectionable boroughs. He understood that this plan was about to be strongly pressed on the attention of Her MaJesty's Government by the parties who took a strong interest in it. He now wished to address a few words of warning to his noble friends in the Ministry. He regarded it as absolutely neoessary thatthedistinction between countyand borough electors should be maintained inviolate. Io viewed, not only with jealousy, but with the greatest possible aversion, any measure such as that which had more than once been introduced into the other House of Parlirmee't for letting in upon the counties the voteS of the 101. householders, and thereby reducing to a nullity the franchise of the freeholders and other proprietora. The inevitable consequence of swamping the counties with 101. householders would ultimately be to throw the whole of the representation into the hands of boroagh members. He knew it was asked whether anything could be mowre ujust than that persons living in 101. houses should have no votes for towns, because they did not live in any borough, and should have no votes for counties, because they were neither 40s. freeholders nor cecn- iers of 501. tenements under the Chandosclanse. He admitted that these persons complained of a verY great hardship and inequ1ality, bFot our whole sYstem Was full of such hardshb n neulte. ok o example, at the WestRidng,whih oly etunedtwo Members, with 'wha fpopulation oelf 24,O000,{O returned the samye nuaber of members. Snch inequalities were inevitable, but the aleed injustice was no ground for such a chanee as had I ocn ~rpose. Otershad ecomende th t i thea been- proposed. Others had recominended that instead of counties or borougbs returning two members thecountry should be divided into electoral districts, as in Franee, each eonsisting of a town and some portion of the country. Ba the conlseqxuence w;ould he, as in Frzance, that thEi town would return the voice of the country district would be loot. He admitted that at one period bribery and orruption werso widely spread and so deeply rooted in our electoral system that he feared they could only begot rid of by some plan of eletoral division. Bat he was gratified to find that bribery and corruption were exceedingly diminished. The Bill introduced by his noble friend nto the other loue of Parliament had produced a considerable effect, and he was entitled to say that at the last general eletion little or no bribery and oerruption bad been committed. Instances there were, no doubt, in which members had been unseated for intimidation, bribery, and corruption, but in general those abuses had ceased to prevail. H Ie was nformed by a learned person who had much experience before Par- aenry that this result was to be chiefly agcribed to the competence of parties to be witnesses nuder the Act of 1851, which being known to all the agents had had a decisive influence in putting down the great and cryini evils of bribery and corruption. Their lordahips often nerar of the great evis of an extended suffiage. There was a very great dislike to universal suffrage which was by no means confined to their lordships' oue:. A highly distin- bedfriendof his on the other side of the channelsaid b 'Above all things avoid universal suffrae." This distinguished person considered that constitutional Goivernsnent and poltical libertyiu France had been laid prostrate by universal suffrage. He agreed in the oppositioa to niersl sufibge if it 'were applied to the choice 6f an offilcer o the agreement to a measure. Bat when his fdends on the other side of the channel attributed the loss of their political libertjgs to universal suffrage, he told them that they did otH pMctrajV before n3ivs gsmu age, butbefora the recollections of 1793 and 1791-b6fore the recollections G thosVe eadfal scenes which no m-1 could name witheot shuddering, when Pris wus ruled by the mob, that worst of tYrants, baving all the bad propensities, the evil desires, and cruel nature of tvrants-equally cap,-ica0s. aad daagerous wheln elevated by hops as when depreWsed by fear, nd as much to be d&Aded when intoxicated with sunC6ss as in the paroxysmas of alarm. It was not only the recollection of those scenes that bad destroye.z constitutional liberty in France, but the later trials to which it hrA been posed-the disturbances of 1818-49. the state of siege by which they had been followed, andc ths experience thus afforded of the inability of our excelleat friends on the other side of the channel to carry on, Parliamentary Government as we did. WhY was there this difference between the two countries? Because it was chsracteristi of the nature of EZnylisbmen alwas to respect, and love, and hold by that which wAs established, and handed down from other ages as the fruit of experience. Englishmen often carried this feeling too far, as he and other Reformeer had sometimes had reason to complain. The people of thi; country were often too slow to admit what was wrong tud too tardy in applying a remedy. But on the other side of the Ohannel it was enough for an i tutlonto beesabihwed to have all men against it. It was the habit of the French people to object to every ititntion that existed; and while our motto was "Everything that is is right?" theirs wra " Everything that is is wrong." It was a zayin' of one of their wits, Paul Loufs Courier, that h verily beHeved he was the only man in France who did not believe that he ought to be the king of the country. The people had a dislike of evey one above them, and wished to bring All prons down to their own leveL Of course he did not now speak of the whole French nation, but of a great body of persons in that country, and he wizhed is aVoice might reach them so that theymight takea leaf out of our book herein, as he would have the English people iake a leaf out of theirs in many other respects. To the crumstance that in France a constitution dissinilar from our own existed, as wll as to a total absence of those paty proceedings by which the working of our Parliamenta GovenPment was distinguished, it was, ha thonght; to be attributed that so many revolations had, within the last entr taken place in that country. Here, in England, the spirit of party never went so far as to endanger the intereets of the State, and instead of causing the advocates of different views and opinions in politics to act in a direction diametreIclly opposed to one another, communicated to them, as it were, a diagonal force by which not only was a disruption of our constitutional ystem avoided, bat a manntedt bonsfit conferred uponx the community at large. In France, on the contrary, party straggles were prosecutad in a spirit of complete antagordsm by those who bappened to be ranged upon one ude of a qtiee' tion and the other. There no compromise, no yielding dpon thes of political opponents was obsevable. The re4ult hiaa n-VartleUrly in f ormer times-ageat national dlsturbanees and oonsequent national revolution, such as had convulsed that country atthe closeof thelst century. Even In more recent times the cause which he had just mentioned had not coased to operate, and to obviate the state of things whieh had prevailed iu France in1848 and 1849, as wlol a to arres the progress of socialimn and to prevent narchy, it had been found absolutely necessary to establish that stong snd able Gove--ment which sinoe continued to confer wpon her the Inestimable bleidngs of tranquity at home and peace abro That she ht long continue to flourish under a rule which b conferred upon her so many advantages was hia earnestdesire. He badonlytosayinconclusiontha hehad risen to mako the present motion without having held any communication with Her MIajesy's Ministers upon the subjeCt of his observations. The views which he had submitted to their lordshipe were but the expression of his individual opinion. Hs had deemed it to behis dutyto enter hisprotest against any measur of Parliamentar reform being proposed thetendencyof which wouIdbeto make ouroonstitition more democratic than it has been made by the Bil of 1832; bat in taldng that course he mnat beg to bo understood as entertaining no vuwlingness to afford the privileges of the franchise to those to whom it might be safely extended. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord concluded by moving for a return of the number of electors in every county and divi. sion of county, city, and borough in the united kingdom; Bar GRANVIILE said he had no objection to the production of the return, and was glad that the noble lord, in giving expression to his own views upon the subject of Par. liAmentry reform, had given their lordships to understand that he had formed his opinions without any communication with Her Majesty's Government. The motion was then agreed to. POSTAL COMMlINICATION WITH AUSTtALIA. The EArl of HARDWICKE, in rising to call the attention of the House to the contract for carrying tho Australian mail, Eaid the subject was one which had been brought under his noUce by vazions gentlemen who representd the interets of tht great colony In this country. He had therefore deemed it to be his duty to submit the sabject to their lordships consideration, and in doing so he should shortly tate that the arrangements for carrying out the postal service with Austala which hald been entered into previous to the war with Russia had been thrown overboard by tha breaking out of hostilities with that country, and thbt sailing vessels had in consequence been resorted to for the pormance of that servlce. As soon, however, as the war tad been brought to a close, the attention of the Government had been directed to the inadequacy of that mode of intercommunication; but before adverting to the stepm which had in cosequence been taken, he might peraps i e permitted to present to their lordships a fe details conneoted with the financial view of the question. The first yea fter the war the cost of the conveyance of -ls to Aust.lia. lA ben upwards of 672,000L., while during the pet year it bad amounted to 78o,3o-a veiy large drain upon thepublic purse. Nor, he would ly bcfore their lordabip3 very shortly the facts of the cas. The Government advertised for tenders for the conveyaanee f these malls, and as was usual announced that they were nct bound to take the lowest tender. Nor did they, for on the contrAry tbey took the hi het tender, and that from a company who bad at their disposal the worst possible means of perforlng the service; and not only that, but when they found that the company was unable to carry out the contract, instead of annulling It and entering into one with com- tent paetieg6 they had endeavoured to patch up the mattr, ere were two ompoanies which had offered to convey the mails-the Peninular and Oriental SteamNavigation Company andtheAustralianMaiAPacket Company. Now, astheir lordships were aware, the Peninsular nad Oriental Company was a very successful company and possessed some of the finest ships in the world, shlps as well known by name as the finest ships in Her MajeeWs navy. That comuany offered to un4ertake to perform the service of carrying the mails and for that service they proffered such ships as the Simla*, the Pera, the Bengal and others of a similar clas They hd alo the advantage of having at that time three of those vessels at the other side of the Cape of Good Hope, and of consequently being prepared to carrytSe mails at the shortest notice by merely establishing a communication between MArseilles and Alexandria; and that company offered to convey the mails for 135,000L. a-ear if Melbouroe wa to be the point of disembarkation, and for 140,0001. if Sydney were selected for that purpose. It true that the ditors ofEthat company declined to enter into any covenant for penalties for non-performance of the contract; they thought that the reputation of their ships and the fact that there would be on board an officer in charge of the mails was of itself a suffident guarantee ; bat while they declined to enter into any contract for penalties for nonperformance, thoy at the same time refused any preomium for a more speedy performance of the service than that guaranteed, and they had at a subsequent perlod offered, under ordinary circumstances, to bind themselves by a penalty of 1001. -day for every da beyond a specified time. H e wished their lordships particuarly to bear in mind thai tbat compaay had offered to perform the contract for 135,0001. a-year. Now, whO, was the proposal of the Australian na Packet Company? Why, they offered to perform the same service for 185,00O. a-year, and they proposed to plac at the service of the Government vessels of a sie and tonnage equal to those which had been offered b the Peninsularand Oriental Company, such as the Oneida, the Melbounne, the Sydney, &c., hut, the fact was that at the time some oi those vessels were not cven built. (Hear, hear.) The Oneida, a vessel exceeding 2,000 tons. wr,s reported by that company to be ready to be surveyed on the lst of August, 1856, and there was a little history connected with that survey which he wished to narrate to their lordships. The ehip was reported ready for surveying on the 1st of August, but she was not actually surveyed until the 20th of that month, and owing to circumstances which had arsen upon that occasion a question had beon put to the rst Lord of the Admiralty npon the subject, to which the right hon. gentleman had replied that the Oneida had been surved and foumd unfit for service, and he did not know how it wan that she had sailed (a laugh) ; and a few days afterwards Mr. Wilson, in reply to a similar question, had stated that the survey of the Oneida took place on the 18th of October, that the ship had sailed on the 19th. and that the Admiralt had received the report on the 2uth. (laughter.) It wias e- traordinary conduct on the part of the Government that the ship sh*ould have been allowed to go to sea on the day after it was surveyed, seeing that it was now found totally unfit for sailinz and was so reported to the Goveramlenb. 6hc srailed with the mails to take her chance. and xneqovrnmnt ppeared to have been Ignorant of that fact. She proved unfit, breakiDg down in that portion of ber mnachinery which was the foundation of her engines. Her machinmey had some time before been injured sod patched up again, and when a strain came to be put on the vessel that portion he had just aUuded to gave way. She found ber way at last to Melbourne under canvass, and again sailed, and again broke down. This company was so inefficient they were obliged to go to the PeninsularCompany to borrow aship (the Binds, we understood). No doubt, the margin which had been left them in the contract was the cause of this Australian Mall Company undertaking that which they knew they could ill perform. Bnt the company were wanting in money as well as vessels, and a ppied to Cunard's lne to know whether thab company would buy their ships and contract, and, receiving a refusal, they next applied to the Oriental Steam Packet Company, who stated their reasons why they-would nob venture to join them. AU this time the Australian mails were failing, and in the time in which five mails should go only three went. Th's broken down company at last hit upon a bright plan which he believed was not yet sanctioned, and it was in the hope of preventing it baing successfully carried out that he now mentioned the subject. This miserable company, if he might call it so by way of distinction from other coropanies, hit upon a plan of propping up their broken fortunes, and proposed to the West IDdia Mail Packet Company to unite with them and form one great company. The Australian Steam Packet Company proposed to hand over to that company their ships and property and to amalgamate and carry ou the Government business. Altogether they considered there would be a capital of about 600,0001. But the West Indis Mail Company wreo not satisfied, got something more, and suggested, aS he gathered from the printed papera, that they would be moat happy to aceede to the proposal, if two years could be got tacked en to the period of their contact. The terms were agreed to upon the condition that Government should granlt an extension of twro yeas'time to the present con- tracts of the two companies, subject to such modifications as migEt be deemed necesary It appeared to him tbat this was a proper mattr to notis eblinlgn the eonditfon in wbrich the taxpaye7s Juthiz eountr6 would be placed if this soheme were permitted to be carried out. The contraet with the West -I&i' Steam Packet Company was made in 1851 for ll years' and he remembered when he was at the Poeto?fice thinldng it might hive been well to h&ve paid- the forfeit W 60,000. and formed new contracts for carrying the Malls to the West Indies, eeing that so large a sumz sg 270,000, a-year was at present pid for that objeot. It was now proposed thakt the two companies should unite if the Government would concede two yeas additional time forI the contracts- so that in effect the country would have to1 pay an annuad sum of 445,(00l. for theservioo of the mails to Australia and West Indies, and the payment for the two years Additional would be equivalent to a bonus of 910.0001i t30imeyears ago a Parliamentary committee st to inquire i into the state of these contracts, and that oommittee reported, among other things, tha as the existing contracts expired it would be desijable to subject them toa strict revson before renewal, and they discouraged the adoption of contracts for any lengthened period, as the Government would thereby be prevented from benefiting by improve. Imentainstean navigation. He believed that now, in consequenoe of improvements in steam narvigation, the Govern- entnt would have plenty of offers for the West Inda mail servioe for 100,00W., or I S,000Oa-Ycar, instead of 270.00. Therefore, if the Government had i ermitted any of their offlcers to sanction the agreemert between the companies by which those companies would receive 445,000h a-year for two years additional, they wouldl necessarily 3affer in the opnion of the public for having done what, he thought, one of the gteatet jobs ever perpetrated, the more par. ticularly as the Government had had it in their powerI to settle the business 'without any difficulty, as this Auslian Steam Packet Company had failed in the performanoe of their duties The Government, therefore, might have got rid of the contract and fotned a new one. The only additional comment he would rnake was that when contracts were offered to the publio they should be open and bond jide, and conduoted 'ithout the semblance of a job of any kind in favour of the parties either on one aide or the other. There should be also a clear understanding that on failure inl the performcance of the contract there should bh a dismissal, with full power to form a new contract, and with no patching up of agreements and bargns with companies m an uninteliWible manner by agents and underlings in pLblic departments. The cam he had endeavoured to explairn resolved itself into this simple matter, that a company contracting with the Govermuent had been unable to perform itg obligations. Under these circumstances the duty of the Government wa clear. They ought to dismiss the company, and enter into the market for ne* on4ate. Instea of this being done the company according to the printed documents, was to be propped up y a umon with anothnr compan: and extension of the term of contract for two years. hc mentioned the circumstance for the purpose he hoped, of effectually stopping any farther progra mi txe matter; and he trusted the Government would deal with theAustralian Steam Paolet Company firmly and decidedly, The Duke of ARGyL said that the noble earl at the close of bis soeech had spoken of a proposed amalgamation between the Australian and European Company and the Wewt India Mai Company, for the purpose of extending the contract over a further period of two yeArs No such proposition, howeverI had been referred to the Post-offlice authoritie, and if it were, he believed that, according to the opinion of the officers of that department, new conditions would be required before such a proposition could be entertaied. But themainpsrt of the speech of the noble earl referred to the question whether the Admiralty and the Treasury were justified in their original contract with the company which now had the privilege of carrying the Anstralan iai. Although four tenders were sent in for the contract, pactially the question lay between two-the Australian and European, wbich now had the contract, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company. In treating of thexe tenders the noble earl had passed very lightly over the important question of penalties. These contracts were made 'withrespectto most of theirdetalls, by the Admiraltyand the Treasury; but the Post-offioe preferred in the conveyance of mnails tlatthe system of penalties should be absolute, and that lY,should operate so as to insre punctuality. He had no doubt that as a rule it operated as a premium on regularity, and in some cases as a v6ry high premium, and he was satis. fied that the public would infinitely prefer to pay a larger sum for the conveyance of the mails if punctuality were thus insured thau to pay a smaller sam without punctuality. (Hear, hear4 Under the present contract there was a penalty of 1001 to be incurred if the contractor failed to provide a stea;mveesel for the conveyance of the mails a- the time specified, and a farther 1004 for every successive day until such ateaumessel should actualy proceed to sea, In addition to these sums there was a penalty of 501. a-day, increaing by 501. for avery succeeding day consumed upon the voyage-from whatevercausearising-beyond the min;uvn time named, proTided that the penalties should in no case exceed tho portion of the subsidy applicable to that particular voyage. Those were the terms of the contract with respect to penlties, but to those terms the Peninsular and Oriental Conpanyrefused to accede, stating inplainlanguage thAttheydecline to beheld responsible for a failure asto the length of the vo age, or for any other failure arising from causes beyund tgsir controL Again, they were vague in their offers with regard to a most important point the time for the commencement of the pro service, stating that it must depend upon the release of the company's ships from the transport business, and that after that severa months would be required for overhauling and fitting u the vemsels for the postal service. The noble earl ha spoken very strongly of the character of the company to which the contract had been given, but he had forgotten to say that they had offered to undertake the whole service between England and Australa He oould nQt admit to the noble earl tha so far as we had had experience of the performances of the company any great want of sucess had marked their exertions hitherto. lIe was not exactly aware of the circumstances under which the Oneida had left thin eountry but havg unfortunately broken down and having been * fong timle deayed penalties had been exacted to the whole amount of the subsdy-upwarda of 7,0004 The second mail was conveyed in 1,246 hours, being 22 hours over the time allowed by the contract,-namely, 2,224 hours; but,as the penalties were calculated in penods of 24 hours each, none were exacted on that occasion. In the third mail the time occupied, including stoppages, was 1,257 hoarv, being 39 heurs under the time allowNed by the contrast,-namely, 1,296 hours, and a small premiam was paid upon that occasion. The fourth mail was conveyed in 1,430 hours, being 117 hours over the time allowed by the contract, and a penalty of 5004 had been enacted on that voyage. Im pressed with the great importanoe of £ecurmur punctulity in the servie, which they thoughtcould hardly be obtained without a system of absolute penalties, the Government had accepted the tender of a company whichhad assented to that principle; and,although the amount involved In the contract was a large one, it muast be remembered that one half of it was borne by the Australian colonies. So far from the couipany being unable o dlscha I its obligatior s, he d dnot think that it co;d be fairly asid, upon the experience of the nine months during which the contract had been in force, either that the company had broken down or that It was likely to breakdown. The Earl of DERBY observed, with referenes to the quetion of penalties, that it was very doubtful policy to insies upon absolute penalties when they were dealing with compames of known respectability, experience, and capital; because when penalties were strictly enforoed for all delays, arising out of circumstances over which a company had no control it was clear that a company which accepted sach a stipuation would charge more than surfiaent to cover it from the risk of those penalties; and in the present case the additional sum paid in order to sewure the company against thepenalty system amountedtobetween400uOL. and O0,0OJ. a- year. Elianoblefriendhadstated thatat the time the contract was enteredinto one ofthese companieshad no vessels ready, whereas the other was prepared to enter upon the service immediately. The noble duko contradicted this; bat the fact ws that, though the company in question was not prepared 'with vessels of 2,400 or 2,500 tons, because those vessels were in the service of the Government at the time they were prepared with vessels of 1,200 tons. He did not know 'whether this was to be considered a bankrupt company or not, bat certainly its first beginning was not avery prosperous one, for hie believed that 'whereas, accordino to the terms of the contraot, five mails were now due fromi Australia only threehad actually arrived. The noble duke said he knew nothing about the circumstances under which the Oneida was permitted to leave this country. He thought, however, that as the noble duke had undertaken to speak for his colleagues on this subject he ought to have made himself acquainted with the facts. The Oneida was reported ready for survey. She wM surveyed, and the offacer reported her unfit, but notwithstanding this she saled and broke down. Yet the Government knew nothing about this grosS case of what he might almost call fraud onathe partof the companyl Nosw,,iahis humble judg ment, the Government, having entered into a contract for the performance of a great pubic service, were bound to see that it was properly performed, And were bound also not to allow vessels to put to sea in connexion wlth it which thoir own officers had reported utterly unseaworthy. (Hear, hear.) The noble duke said he did not know whetner this was a bankrupt company or not He (Lord Derby) hoped they were able to fulfil their engagements, but the fact had not been disputed that they had been desirous of selling their contracts, and in their distress had appled to their unsuccessful rivals. The company with whch they were In treaty,,- it appeared, considered the ircumastances of tbe Australian Maal Conipany so bad that they refused to enter into any partnership with them unless they obtained the extension for two years of a very lucrative and, he might say as far as the Government were concerned, extravagnt contract. The Secretary of the Treasury had stated in another place that no official announcement of such a roposition had yet come before the authorities, but that when it did come before them it would be considezed with due regard to public interests. That was a veryeAsy mode of evadingthe question, but he(the E;rl of Derby) certainly wished the noble duke had spoken a little more positively, and he thought the Government were bound not to sanction the extension of a very lucrative contract in order that the affairs of a bankrupt company might be patched up. In his judgment, the Government ought to authorize no suach agreement, and without it they knew from the West India Mil Company's declaration that they would not take up the Australian Company's vessels and property. The simple facts were these:-There had aeen a complete violation of the contracb, and the Government, therefore, were absolately free. There was no necessity for them to enter into any negotiation. They could go into the market and make their ovwn arrange. ments for the conveyance of the mails; but, above all, they ought not to give undue advantages to the existing company for the mere purpose of patching up their affairs. He did not know that any particular advantage was to be obtained from the amnalgamaation of these oonupanies. At any rate, he was quite sure the Government ought not, in order to further it, to extend the period of what was understood to be a very extravagant contraot. (Erear.) The Duke of ARGYLL thoughtsa degree of asperity entirely uncalled for had been introauced into this discussion When she noble earl opposite gave notice of his intention to bring this subject under notice he understood that referencs wOuld be made to the prudence or improdenoe of entering lnfo the original contrect And the manner in which the omnr hd fwlfiled their engagemMnt.

OATHS VALUDrIT ACT AMENDMNT BILL. Sir F. THESIGER-Seeing the noble lord the member for the city of London In his plaes, perhaps I may be permitted to ask hima supposing thollso should gree to ibe motion of wrhich he r egiven notice for the appointmnent of a select committee to consider 'whether the Aot of the 5th and 6th of William IV., chap. 62, is applicable to oaths appointed by law to be taken by members of this House at the table, what he proposes to do with the Bill which stands for to-night in his name for a second reading? Lord J. RUSSELL-I propose to postpone that Bill for LIABILITS OF TRUSTEES. Mr. HADFIELD asked the Attorney.General whether he intended to bring in a Bill this session or the mext to relieve trustees from certain liabilities at law in respect of trust property, consequent on acts done by them in the reasonable *exercise of their judgment, and without fraud; and) from the acts of co-trustees, deposits with banlkers, and other delings, such as would be remsonable and proper in the conduct of private business ? The ATTORNEY-GERAL said he certaily was anxious to accompany the measure designed to prevent frauds by trstees with another measure almost equally necessary, of the nature indicated by the hon. member. A noble and learned lord in another place, however, had given notice of his intention to Introduce such a Bill, and he (the Attorney-General) had thought it desirable to postpone himeasure untU he had seen the Bill of that noble and learned lord. LEASES AIND SALES OF SETTLED ESTATES ACT AMENDMENT BILL. Mr. WHITESIDE said, in reply to Lord R. GRosvmzos, if he should not be able to bring on the second reading of this Bill to-morrow (this day) he shoald postpone itauntil the next session. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LONDO.I AND DUBLIN. Mr. REPTON asked the Secretary to the Treasry if he would lay upon the table of the House copies of the correspondence between the Government and the London and North-Western Railway Company relstive to the improved communication between London and Dablin. Mr. WILSON said the correspondence was very volaminous, but he should lay on the table the terms of the contract if that woould satisfy the hon. gentleman. MONEY DUE1 FROM THE MONTEVIDEAN GOVERNMENT. Mr. WISE asked the Secretry to the Treasury what was the total amount of the money advanced to Mr. Onseley on account of the Montevidean Government, by whose authority the advances were nade from the civil contingencies fund, and what prospect there was of the repsyment of the 37,395g. stated to be the bRalnce now due to this country - vhetheritwathe practiceof theForeign-office to draw on the TreaSury for pa ents of this c4arater to foreign Governments without t consent and knowledge of Parliamnent? (Esear, hear.) Mr. WILSON said, the total amount due to Her Majesty's Government from the Montevidean Government was 50, 9091., of which37,3951. had been advanced from civU contingencies and the rest by votes of that House. With regard to the prospet of repayment, all he coulId s%y was that Her Majesty's Government were doing their best to induce the iontevidean Government to rep what the English Government believed to be a just debt no to them from tie Government of Mfontevido Thmnews adva.ced by the English ons.l-en for the benefitof the oormtmuity of Ronteiedrig ieof disturbance, and his noble friend at the head of the Foreigno vlovewas doing what ho could to procure the liquidation of the debt. With regard to the last question, he thought if the hon. member would consider what the nature of the ivfil contingencies fund was he would see thst it was a sum of money voted by that Romse annually for the purpose of meeting ui(p.. Zen emergencies, and that if any emerghency arose, wrhethor at homeor albroad, it wvas to that fend Tha t MIStr looked for the pament of the expense. Te Foreign-office did not draw on the Treasury, but on an emsrency ariing the Foreign-office applied to the Treasury, andi the latter departmen t thoaght the espenditure fitting they maidei an advance for the purpose on their own kept in total ignorance of this vote since 1851? Mr. WILSON said Parlament had not been kept in total igorance of the vote. it was not a vote ;. the money was adtvanced from the civil contimngencis fund. Sir H.

RUSSELLrose and ad,-In risng to nake the motion of which I have given notioe, upon a subject whih concerns the reats of member inthis House-a motion wbkh my noble friend has allowed me to make in preoedene of the orders of the day-I should be wanting is respect to this Houe If I did not lay before it ft grounds of that motion, althongh on the other hand, it voa be higbly presumptuous In me to attempt to submit to t House anything like a complete argument upon s,queasti o law which I hope will be discued by the persom oet competent to deal with It. I shall therefore endeavour to lay such a statement befor the ouse as may justify me la' skng for the appointment of the committee which I pro. pose, leving the complete discussion and. sifting of the question to the members of the committc I haveupon the paper to-night a Bill respecting the validity of eertsn oaths Since I introduoed that Bill Baron Rothsewl hes Informed me that the suggestion hs been made to Mlm-it is not mAterial at the preeent moment to sy by whomht htthe Act to rhicth I have referred in my notice would enable this House to make an order by which he could take a declaration at the table in lieu of tie oath o£ a. juration; and that if the Hous should be pleased to adopt that course he would feel no objection to make a delaration, so established by order of this Hlome. When I wa1 thus informed I looked carefully at the ActtowhichIw rerede ad I shIl endeavour to state the general purport of gtt Act and the policy upon which It appeared -to mne to be founded. At the commenoeaent of the reign of Wil. ham IV. it was the opwion of Parliament tut sono. endeavours ought to be nade to reduoe the great multiplicitr of oaths which had become a saondal to this country, and which frequently led to an appeal to Almighty God Incese" the most frivolous, and evsn in cmes in which it wa notorious tbat the oaths were unnecessary. Among those whose specil attention was directed tothis embject w the Duke of RicbLmond, a man of very great capacity and of the hiabestintegrity. TheDuke ofIiohnondbrought thequosNow before the House of Lords, and on his suggestion, or the suggestion of tome other personx, a Bill was passed relievIDg the departments of the Excise snd Customs from a great; number of unnecessay oaths, In 1835 a further step wa taken in the me direion, andaBillwas presentedtov the Hous.e of Lords, by which it was proposed to include. all the great departments of the State, and to enable theLords Commisiones of the Treasury to appoint coert declations which were to be taken in the offioe of ths. Treasury itslf, in the offioes of the Secretaies of State, and, in fact, in all the highest and moat Important officee In. this country. The polioy, therefore, was, ea it were, ane ascending policy, mounting from the minor deputment! of Custom-house officers and excisemen to the diseinguahedK personag administering the government of the vountryn and as the Act which I propose to amend was supposed ts extend only to oaths taken in courts of justice, so tie Actto which I am now refering was one of a totaly different. deecription, and applied to aU those oaths which had been. appointed to oe taken by the great offioers of State. I shalL state some of the provisions of the 5th of William IV., cap, 8, which is, in fact, the foundation of the Aot to whi4h mymotion relates. That Act was entitled:- "An Act for the more effectual abolition of oaths anr affirmations taken and made in various departments of the. State and to substitte declarations in lieu thereof ; and for tie more entire suppreMion of oluntay and extrajudicial oaths and affidavits." It was provided in the Act thsatit should come into force on the 1st of June, but it did not receive the Royal assent tila the 12th, and therefore it was neceay to pabs another to, amend it. The latter is the Act towhich my motion refere -viz., the 5th and 6th of Wiliam IV., cap. 62. It is called an Act to amend the former Act. In the 6th-. section the oath of allegianoe ts declared to be an oah forwhich no substitution of a declaration shall be allowed.. That is very remazrkable, because it shows the intention oE Parliament with regard to the oath of alUegince, sepalng_ it, from the oath of abjuration, and various other oaths. The 7th section omits, judioial proceedings, and declares; that the Act shall not extend to them, thus stillmoreclearly confining the Act, and pointing it to the adainis. tration of oaths in the higher departments. The 8th seotlor, is to the following effect:- " And be it enacted that it shal be lawful for the Uni versities of Oxford end Cambridge, and for all other bodie corporate and politic, and for all bodies now by larrwoL statute, or by any valid usge, authoized to administer o- recsive sqy oath, solemn affirmation, or affdavit, to nah. ststutes, bylaws, or orders auenorxzing and dir tha substitution of a declaration in lieu or an oath ema affirmation, or affidavit now required to be tgkez by Jaw." The Act likewise provides a schedule showing the form of. affirmation which was to be taken Instead of an oath, whereby any proper authority the one was subituted or the, other. "I, A. B., do solemnly and sincerely decla thatp -hero there was a blank for the substoace of. the dooeara. tion-" and I Zmake "This solemn doolaration oo cientously believig the' sme to be true, asd by virtue of the provisions of au Act. nade and pased n the- year oi Iigl present Maje entitled, &C."'u rnMaet, 'Now, Sir, it is plain from those words, placing upon them. the usual OOnstruction that words should have, that the House of Commous, being a body authorizd by valil usage to administer and rceive oaths, is a body whib 13 indluded within the provisions of tha'Act of Parliament In stating this opinion I of course am only saying what oons,. to me as a plain unlearned man of tho mreanig of this Act but in proposing a oommittee.

LOA'DON, TUESDAY. AUGUSr 4. 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord PA.Nmm= brought in a Bill to enable the Government to embody certain regiments of the Militia, should the requirements of the public service render such a step necessary during the recess. After some discussion, ia the course of which the Government was taunted by Lords Dra-Y asnd HA4RDWICKa with having changed its mind on this matter, the Bill was read a first time. Lord Buou*H&i. moved, as a preparatory itep towards the measure of Parliamentary, Reform expected next session, for returns of- the number of electors in every county, city, and borough in the Inited Kingdom. Lord GRANV ;LE, on the part of the Government, had no objection to the production of the returns, which were accordingl3 oidered. Lord B ARDwroC cslled the. attention of the Government to the subject of the Australian postaI contract, and in a lengthy speech declared that the comnpany with which the existing coiitrct was mde having failed to fulfil ihs obligations, the contract. itself was void, and the Govermnent free to ente into a fresh contract. The Duke of AuGixT entered into th6 details of the question, and contnded, that the pertorbminee of the contract Lad not been hitherto so unsatisfactory as to warrant the Government iti throwing it iup, especielylas n 'elemetnt in that contract Was the entorcement of,rtamnpenalties. The Earl of DaBim thought the ystem ofPpenalties one of very dobbtMftt epediency. and warned the Governmeit -a iiiit cdntnuing wh-at was understood to be a very extrvagant contract. The Duke of AoxYxL replied, and the matter dropped. Some Bills a fe'. d i;elr Lordshipa adjourned. Lord J.

Nobody who reds the Act of Parlasu;ent brougbkt before tie notice of the Commons last night Csa deny th4t Lord JOEU RuSSELL'S question as to its bearing on the Jews is at least . A very reaonabe one. It may indeed be a matter of surp4se that its pOssible application. to the Jews was not noticed at the time, or that the House of Comffmonm from that day to tWii has not observed the application, even when 'carefuly coUleeting Snd sctalinizing all the Acts that might apply to the Jews; but this surprise will only be. felt by ihe umsophisticated pottion of the public, who imagine Parliament a perfectly reasonable, nmetodica1, consistent, and businesslike body. The cori trary is the fact. Parlianment -is lwa.ya blun4ering,-sometimes blundering into,-error, sometimes into truth; 60metimes in sjmall Ihingg, sometimes in great. By way of a. small blunder -gkeat enough, howeverj- to require a eQial, Act of Parliament to cfsrect it-it appears that the measure cited on this oecadon, ..SQlajitutlmg an affinmation for an oath, was fist pamed to come into force on the 1st of June,. and in. that shape figures in the Statute-book a the Act 5th d WtaLmEt IV., cap. 8. As, however, the Act dia not receive the Royal Asnent till Juae 12, it became necessary to ' pass anothe' Ap4, professedly arenediog it, but really. th same Act, and entitled " 5 W rxA lyi, "( cap. 62," which is tbe Aet now iunder consideration. This, it may be- said,: is R small blunder, and does not lead us to expect sucii a serious error as unwittingly and reluctantly admitting an obnoxious and suspected class -intD Parliament; still less does it justify,the attempt to act on that error, and take idvanitage of th'e Parliamentary laches.

A successful nation, like a successful man, does t'ot expect universal sympathy and condolence in its difficulties. We know quite well how we stand in that respect. Nor do we cormplain at alL It is perfectly natural that our neighbours in Europe and America should be looking, on now upon the great Asiatic conflicts in which we are engaged with an interest not wholly unpleasurable. We will not quote the maxim about the misfortunes of -our beat friends, becanse it does not quite suit the case. Our neighbours cannot exactly indulge --n the luxury of pity, because our case is not bad enough for that. We are too vulgarly prosperous -as yet. No, but there is such an attitude as that, - of standing by watching with a general idea -*on the part of the spectator that we «Say possibly get the worst of it, and that he will not be partictlarly sorry if we do. Dominant nations, j7ust like public men, are accustomed to these friendly expectations. They are aware that many eyes around them are watching their course, especially if a cloud is overhead, with a somewhat unsympathetic curiosity. We know ,that we are now formning a pleasing subject of conjecture to a wide circle. " NoW, then, what " wiU Great Britain do ' How will she get out cof this mess? How will her Jndian prestige " stand ?" &c. Prophecy is proverbially interest-ing. Religious prophecy is the most fascinating part of theology. Hundreds of div-ines become ,quite indifferent to the existing condition of the *world or the church, so absorbed are they in imagining and guessing what it will be; -Social prophecy also is very interesting. Half I *"Or gossip is prophecy. We discuss the - destinies of our friends with great hilarity, -their aims in life, abilities, tempers, connexions, thoir pecuniary resources, and wbat will Ioe the probable reault of the whole. Nor is prophecy the less light-hearted for making out that -the prospect is a gloomy one. This kind of talk is pleasant enough; it ranks by the side of ghost stonles, dreams, marvellous coincidences, and the gossip of the supernatural world. And where a .great nation is concerned the dignity of the 2moralist comes in. It is quite safe to say that 'we are a wicked nation, because upon the old,proverb, that the " majority are wieked," a nation cannot eaily avoid being so. Well, then, our great national faalts have to be punished, and a solemn judicial vista opens before the censor's -eye. A great many people never feel so comlortable as when they are talking about "jucdg. "xnents." It is the cheapest form of virtue there -is. It costs absolutely nothing, at the very time that the virtuous enthusiasm of the judge is at ,ts greatest height. .. 1 NoNv, 'we have no wish to rob our friends and imeighbours of so many interesting subjects. It -would be eruel to do so. Let them prophesy :a3 much as they please. Let them gossip about Ms ; let them judge us with all solemnity. We like 'virtuous enthusiasm, and 'would not suppress it on any accouat. But we must remind them of one feature in our case whieh they ought to know. It appeaxs very certa:n that we have no quarrel with any nation in the East-i. e., with the mass of people either in India or Ohina. Why, our fleet steamed up the Canton River amid an attendant and friendry navy of "sampans and junks." 'The invasion-if we are to call it so-seemed quite I 4a popular step. "'The boats came about us with bananas, lemon syrup, and sweet potatoes." " A Chinaman. contracted for supplying us with freak 4(meat and vegetables, charging us hardly more <' than the market price." "The husbandmen upon "the banks pursued their labours in tlheir paddyc"fields under the protection of our guns, which "for the timeshieldedthem fromthe violence of " the Mandarin sailors." This does not look like popular hatred or distrast. It is true that a fanatical party keeps- airs out of Canton, but everyv body knows the power of evenL a small fanatical aninority to overawe the mass, especially if, as in the prment ease, the interests of the Government go along -with the olaims of Isaperstition. It xemqyns to be seen what.It is wich has &hut ua out- of Canton; whether it iesifyis the popular feeling against the anger, as the Chinese Government preteuds, or whethei that'is CsIy * pretkXt of the Government to disguise its own reluctance to fulfil the treaty. tt we vre to interpret naturally the behaviour of the Chinese thronging round our fleet 'as it went up the river, the people ippear to havo no feeling again'4 -s. 'We are at war with a Cb{irt, and not "with a natiou. It will be said that the Chniess will do anything for -money, and that they know the English have money. Well, we do not inquire into the motive-we simplyftte the fact. For Borne reason or other they seem to have no objection to us. it money is their object; that only shown tbat the objection to. the society f the foreigner yields to that motive, and that what brings them into contact with us is stronger than wwhat-keeps them aloof from us. A Chinaman is. a selfish animal, 'but that does not interfere with the fact that he trasts us, believe' in our: fair deaing, kows . we will not hurt him wantonly, and courts our custom and company even when we &re invading}hdm. It is the samie in India. The' enemy-is our own soldier, and not tlhe Hindoo. Far from joining the military Mutiny, the people, so far as our accounts go, actually persecute and maltreat the mutineers when they are caught ,traggling. A private letter states that 500 of them who had escaped into the Mahomedan valley of Swat-Were first circumcisea and, then sold as slaves, an old native officer realizing only sixpence-halfpenny. This, it will be said, is Mahomedan feeling, not :ritish. It may be, but still the fact shows that there is no feeling for the mutiny. The Mahomedans have risen against us as much as the Eindoos, arid the one sect would not persecute the other if there were the slightest national bias for the mutineers, or if the mutiny were regarded. in the least as a patriotic Inovenment. Indeed, the Indian authorities have calculated so completely on the apathy of the mass in the North-West that they have offered a reward of 51. for every mutineer brought in, dead or alive, 'with his arma. Facts, indeed, appear to show that we may expect in this contest a seasonable return for that justice and consideration which have marked our Indian administration. It would seem that this has made some impression at last upon the native. He knows he is safe under us; he is not molested, he is not injured. He has had nearlv a century's experience now of a fair government, under which life and property are protected. He feels he has no interest in change, and he stands aloof from this mutiny just as he would from any foreign invasion which would be evidently and transparently for the benefit of the invader and not for hiis. At the same timae we must not forget that the FsAsxFsTxEN of our own creation is a formidable opponent, nor disguise from ourselves the difficulties of a contest with a well armed and well disciplined mutiny, wvhich may tax our resources to their utmost.
The Divorce Bill offers one of those occasional instanees in which a large majority furnishes the best answer to ingenious and plausible arguments. The House of Comnions may in many cases be imperfectly informed. Aecounts from India, tom China, even from Irish farms and Lancashire factories, must in a great measure be taken on trust; but every member of the House knows what fiarr riage is either by personal experience or by frequent observation. Roman Catholic communities have thought fit in dealing with the conjugal tie to accept the guidance of the only order in the community which stands apart from the natural relations between men and women. It is not surprising that a married or marriageable Legislature should arrive at different conclusiona from those of a celibate clergy. The common sense opinion of the country is-faithfullyinterpreted by the vote of the House of Commons. Divorco ought not to be obtained on trifling grounds; it ought not to be impossible; above alU, it ought not to be awarded by two or three successive tribunals at an extravagant cost. It is remarkable that the innovation proposed concerns neither principle nor practice, but only judicial procedure. The opponents of the meahure have habitually acquiesced in the passage of Divorce Bills, which are judicially decided in the House of Lords and guarded by standing orders in the House of Commons. Not even MIr. GLADsToxN ever objected to the sessional appointment of a Divorce Committee to enforce the regulations of the House. The 8,000 remonstrant clergy have been content to take their chance of remarrying a divorced woman, and nineteen-twentieths of their number would have felt a just indignation against the conduiet of the adulterer if he had refused to make the only possible reparation to the victim or partner of his immorality. The House of Lords, under the influence of the Episcopal Bench, has indeed habitually inserted in Divorce Bills a clause to prohibit the intermarriage of the guilty persons; but Bishops, after all, have feelings and consciencee, and the Lords would long si-nce have unalimonsly abrogated their standing order if they had not known that the House of Commons invariably struck the clause out of the Bill. The alleged oppression of the thinner-skinned clergy ought to receive fair consideration; but there is always a risk in legislating for the relief of conscientious scruples. Simple and straightforward minds prefer a positive law, which covers their individual responsibility. Atany a worthy clergyman would marry any couple in the absence of legal impediment, if he felt himself to be acting ia the regular course of his ftiections. As soon as the exercise of his office becomes voluatary he might tbink that he was countenancing immoral conduct by rendering to candidates for marriage a service -which he was at liberty to refuse. Those who really object to the desecration, as they term it, of the marriage ceremony may easily protect themselves by a visible exhibition of the austere severity within: The wretched woman who has just been renounced by her family and excluded for life from the society of her equals will scarcely turn from indulgent divines and from indifferent registrars to demand the performance of the marriage ceremony at the hands of the virtuous malcontent. Even if the request were refused, with a hint that the Church would, under the circumstances, rather administer excommunication than marriage, the sufferers would feel little inclination to assert their rights and to revive their notoriety by a suit in the Prerogative Court. The grievance wlich the petitioners deprecate would be so rare and Eo trifling that they would perhaps do well to reserve to themselves the possibility of easy martyrdom. The promiinence which so trivial a difficulty has attained in the course of the discussion goes far to prove the insignificance of the objections to the Divorce Bill itself. Mr. GLADSTO-2'S extraordinary power of oratory was again displayed by his success in riveting the attention of the House of Commons during a long theological disquisition, wbich was at the same time minute and irreleVant. Even on the Scriptural ground Mr. WALPOLE had the best of the argument, but. it was a triumph to concentratethe interest of the debate on an immaterial issue. Any interpretation propounded by the ingenuity of br. GLADSTONE or by the rival subtlety of the ATTo,NFY-GFSUAL would be perfectly compatible with the approval or rejection' of the M6verninent Divo,rce Bill ; but it j isSiply in osible, -th5t the expediency of pasing an A;et- of Parliament sahodld depend on an' e% pression ;i0*h has beenj diferentli reiortea by twra of the 'Evangelists. The House of Comne wi aeyer Wrpe alurdly pyd tlhan when, two, or three times .in a S;lon it, devotes an evening to Biblical criticisni. ; the. alleged prohibition of Divorce may. for those aho -persuade.themselves to beliove l-it be-bin4qug one, the individual conscience, 4ut, asoietyq,..panjsot abdicate theiduty of determiningon its ow)respon-, sibility the, ctvil conditions and conoequejuce!., of, marrage. The legitimacy of children, which is at-* t;he same,time the moat certain teBt and the principal incident of lawful mar;riage, in. all countzkies depends on the provisions of .the municipal.jw. The retrospective effect of marriage on.. the offspring of a . previous il ijit connexion, i! reeognized over the greater , part of Europe. The stricter law and opinion of Engiad #re. a, national-.tradition, but they have never pretended to rest on any exclusiye Scriptural autl4o- rity. There is no practice more idle and frivolgus, than the arbitrary selection of a few propositions out of various parts of the Bible for, the purpose of treatliig them 's bindinag 'nacttenti. The Puritanical zects which affected to regulate all human relations by an inspir*d and all-sufficient code w-ere at least consistent in their error, but a repository of principles is something different from a collection of specitic laws. The decision of Parliament is simply that the Divorces which have long been permitted shalt be attained at a smaller outlay. In accordance with common seuse it is still held that the corruption of the wife is a graver and more incurable wrong than the infidelity of the husband. The familiar levity of amateur divines in dealing with the doctrines which they have appropriated to themselves is pleasantly exemplified in Mr. G7"nsToNi's assertion that, the equality of the sexes is a great Christian principle. It would not be difficult to show that such aproposition, however well-founded ia itself, could never have occurred to any writer: of the Old or 79w Testament ; but in the conjugal relation at least the laws of nature have produced a dissinilarity of position between husband and wife, whatever may be their respective claimas to superiority. It, is only on one side that spurious offspring can be introduced into, the family. The. present B,ill give& an additional protection to womea by permitting Divorce on the application of the wife in cases -where the infidelity of the husband is. aggravatecd by desertion or by systematic cruelty. The Government ought, therefore, to receive credit for a partial attempt to realize Mr, Gr&sToK2'S great Christian law. Some of the opponents declared that the most objectionable part of the measure was the per, mission of remarriage accorded to the . guilty party; but the objection, if it has any validity, applies equally to the wrongdoer and to the wronged. No human or Divine law prohibits the marriage of those who 'may previously have led questionable lives. The real raeaning of the dissentients is, not that the . divorced woman is unworthy .of maTriage, but that she is mprzied already; and the same disability must necessatily .attach to' the.-injured husband. The pretended, desecration of the wedding ceremony is a frivolous afterthought. None of the remnonstrant.clergy would. hesitate to bestow the nuptial benediction on a seducer and on his repentantvictim. It would be. a. monstrous abuse of power if the Legislature were to compel a divorced woman to remain the mistress of her paramour. It is satisfactory to the promoters of a legislative change to know that all that can be urged against it has been said, and said in vain. Two speakers, "graced 'vith " all the power of words," have done their utmost to persuade either Bouse that a simplification of procedure in Divorce cases was a gross and profane innovation. .Vhen the Bishop of OxPOBD and Mr. GZADSTONE have failed in convincing Parlinment or public opinion, it may be reasonably assumed that the want of success proves the weakiiess, not of the advocates, but of their cause.
Any one of our readers whose hard fortune it was to be comupelled to move about the town jesterday; even with all the cool comforts of duck' trousers and the relief of Hansom cabs, can without any great effort of imagination conceive what his feelings would have been had he performed the: same suiltry gymnastics in the regulation dress of the British Infantry of the Line. One cannot think without a shudder of that tight regulation tunic, admirAbly adapted as it may be by its texture :for the performance of duty amidst the Canadian snowd; of that heat-conductor for the head wlhich is called a shako, and of the various ligatures and accoutrements with which the body of the soldier ia encumbered.. Well, then, intensify the heat under which we were groaning yesterday to any conceivable point under which mortality "may exist.-echa.nga the heat of the London streets for the unclouded ardour of the plains of British India-and imagine a regiment of English soldiers staggering on their way to deadly battle with .all these Northern wraps and encumbrances about them, and you have a speoimen of the results of official wisdom. UInder date from Calcutta of the 12th of June we find it stated.by an officer, that with every contrivance to keep the hot air and sunsliine out of his room, the thermometer in that room would stand at 90 deg. and 9k deg. The men of the 64th and 84th, and of otl.er regiments just arrived, were, notwithstanding, clothed in their tunics-just as though they were about to perform duty on the lIorse Guards' Parade. When sent up the country in the small stifing river steamers in which they are as closely packed as herrings in a barrel the wretched creatures are still swathed in these red 'tmuics. The sufferings the men endure from their shakoes are, perhaps, still more dreadful, and are certainly more directly destructive of life. I. it any wonder that with nothing on their heads but the shako, which leaves the back of the head entirely exposed, and which serves itself rather as a conductor of heat than as a protection .against it, our poor fellows should be so frequently struck down by cowys de soleil? Let us not deceive ourselves as to the causes which lead to the loss of European life in Indian campaigning. The slaughter inflicted by the efforts of an Indian enemy is comparatively insignificant-it is the climate1 it is the burming sun of India which is the deadliest foe. The casualties of the hospital are far more fearful both in number and in character than the casualties of the battlefield. It isnnot to.be denied that the dangers from siclness on the march are to a certain degree inseparable from Indian warfare; but at least certain causes are within our control. Why should we blindly adhere to routine when reason points to the adoption of another course? When we see the Minister of War and the Cornmander-inOhiefUgo.out grouse-sho6ting at noon on a sultry August day in the.dresses of North Sea pilots and with military sha*ces to keep their brains cool, we shall.,begin to believe at, least that our. great military authoritieet are convinced that burning, valour anxd burning fever go together, and that it is pund.plicy.. to tax a man's energies to the utrnost when lIeJhas been ingenious3y worn down to an incapaeity for WI exertion. If we leave for. a maoment but of . the question all, considarations of huminity, and of the deep responsibilitie of thoe whoremainat home towards those braveml.eB wIho go out .to fight theirceomxtry?i 'battles int£he .*eI4*.let us.look at tbis matter from an eecoixmiiipofin,;of view.

After evidence had been given to id9ntify the bedies the coroner proceeded to the residehoe of Ed6aard Elliott, the engineer at the bottom of the pi, wbo was eeverel:y burnt, pnd who lies in a dangerous condition, From the evidenoe o this 'witpess it appeared, that whilo he and a man named, Wlliuxa Nolau were winding up bome tubs they noticed that the coal had fallen, out -of there, and they thought something was wrong. It tas agreed that Nolan should go dovwn the pit Sefore they wound up any more tubs. Nolan went down, and he never saw anythingof him afterwards. The witness went into the engine-house to wait for Nolau to give him the signal to be drawn up, and before any signal. ws reocived the explosion took place.

Your obedient servant. X T. z. Aug. Z. : " W have had no outbreak " Pesbawtr, Jnne 14. ",We have had no outbreak here, bat we have had to disarm three native infantry regiments and one of cavalry, liaving discovered that they intended to masscre us all on the 22d (1:y). It was done at the same moment to all the regihnents, though atidifferent points of the station, Eumall European force, guns and cavalry, being told off to each. That night the disarmed men began to desert in numbers-a proceeding it was actuall necessary to stop lest they should raise the city and neighbourhood; so they were overtaken and brought back, and 13 or 14 hung, pour Cncourager 7es autres. None have gone since. AU their private arms, which every soldier haS, were also taken away, guns kept con-t'ntly p6iutea -,w.ad- their- ISnes, witb bodies of 1urco peans ready to turn out at a moment's notice, and a station flooded with a host of levies brought up from Mooltan by the foresight of Pdwazdes, who raised them in the last Pun. jab campaign. One of them offered to polish off all te r,-qpoys at' 6d. (foar Annas) a-head. The crisis may 1o said tOhave been ov6r on'the 22d; but ourpo8ition then 'wasia rmost.dangerons one, from wlhicih the hand of Providence, us1g as his inatrument the best soldiers and politicals in ipdi s r.ue,eus. Fancy2,00O0Europeans in astatloi with seven regiments, all, with one exception, prepared to nse on us, backed up by a cantonment populated with the. greatest scobundrel3, a city fulloof ruffians ready' to yoln the miitineers, and a chain of forts surmounding -i9, garrisoned. by four more regimenti, ready to eor4c biiie and'march down upon us ! Further on we were encircled by tho hlls, ful of fanatics, thirsting for our blood, snd in open concert with the matineers. To add to our troibles, the country people, knowing wliat was impending on that day (2PM), wrould not bring in supplies, nor woula the Mooltan levies take service till it was seen ho'W W hould fare. The immediate disarming of the regiments above-roentioned was imperative, and done aceordingly with effect. Confidence was at once restored, and supplies Anl levies came in the next day. A force of European6 witq guns wvas sent ronnd 'the fort, oue of whieh, Meerdnu, wRas heldfby the 5Sth NatXie Intantry in open mutiny; they tried to escapo when our force appeared, and some got off to Swat,. theothers were mado prisoners, 150 were killed on-th6 spot6 % tried by drmhead oourtvmartial, and instantly shot, including ,a native officer of a regiment nsot in mutiny, who would ' not act as he was ordered. Others were driven into the hills and kIlled by the hilmen, a p-ine of 10 rupees being set on their heIdu. The tcolonel of this regiment blew out his brains in disgus it the 'autiny. The villains kept their officera in eonfluemeni and, told thers if they tried to escape they would roast 1thom alive. Thqy did, however, manage to escape The force then went and disarmed all the other vegiments in the orits and quieted the district. Some of the 200 prisoneis of ''thd55th ha`ve'bben tried, and we blek 40 of then '*j from our guns in the presence of the whole force three days ago, a fearful but necesary example, whioh has strsuk -terror into their soufS. Three sides of a square were f6rsned, 10 guns pointed outwards, the sentenoe of the court was read, a prisoner bound to eaoh guD, the signal given, and the ssalro fred. Such a sedne I hope mever again to witnesshumaun trunks, head, legs, arms, &o., Jlying about in all direetions. All met their fate with firmness but two, who would not be tied up ; so to save time they were dropped to the' gtound and their brains blown out by musket*y. T±ials are going on, and the mutineer will never forget the lesson taught at Peshawur. It is not my business to dontrast or compare with scenes elsemwhere, I trust and believe we have done what duty demands."

SECOND EDITION. HEB TIMBAfOVpIOEB Tucdcj Mn4g. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following Is the letter of our Pars eorreopondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m..- The events which recently occurred in Italy have doubtlesa met, as they deserved, disapprobation from all moderate men; but while these condemn the wickednes of such attempts as Pisacane's in Calabria and the M&zzinians atpGenoa, they complain that, though it was the Congress of Paris which excited the just hopes of the Italian Liberals, the Wetemrn Powers have doue nothing, or next to nothing, to obtain from the Italian Governments the reforms which they themselves had counselled. The ModerateorOonstitntionalparty,theyallege,habeen everywherediscouragedandaban doned,anditisowing to this that theRepublicanshave made the last desperate attempt to win back the ground which they had lost, and have taken the initiative in a general mnovement. Such is the explanation given by the persons I allude to of the occurrences or Genoa, Leghorn, and Calabria. It is true the attompt ha been once more put dowix, but it does not follow that the Governaents wae right and the people wrong. It is a mistake to suppow that Mazzint is the cause of all that occurs in Italy, or that if he were dead, or exiled to some distant wilderness, the Italiza people would become reconciled to their Present rulers. Let good government prevail in Italy, and Mazzini and his band would soon diappear. If the Italian Peninsula was governed like Piedmont, if its rulers were just and liberal, revolution and revolutionists need no longer be apprehended. As long as a system of oppression prevails we must, I fear, make up our minds to witnes Other events which may not always be confined to Italy. It is not merely in the interest of the Italian States, but of Europe generally, that the Powers ihould be anxious for the triumph of the Italian liberty. Sismondi was not mistaken when he obxerved that " Europe would know no repose so long as the people who, in the middle ages, lit the torch of civilization with that of liberty, did not themselves enjoy the benefit of the light which it created." The moment sms*n propitious to perform the work of regeneration which the Western Powers eemed so lately disposedto undertake. The Constitutional party gives signs of life in all the States of the Peninsula, and everywhere is the desire for reforms which guaranteed liberty, as well as life and property. Bologna, Ravenna, Forli, and other towns of the Legations have already presented Plus IX. with addresses containing this one demand. In Tuscany unmistakeable rnanifeations have occurred in favour of the Constitution, and one on a larger scale is preparing for the Pope's arrival at Florence. JEome is also, it. is said, getting up her addresses and petitions for the moment of the Holy Father's return to his capital. At Naples the question is more complicated, as it involves not merely the form of government, but the dynasty itself; but both parties, whether the Liberals who are supporters of the Bourbons, or the partisans of Murat, join in the demand for representative institutions. The desire of the different provinces of Italy is to possess, like Piedmont, a progressive and national Government. If that legitimnate wish be left unsatisfied there will assuredly be fresh outbreaks in Italy; the foreign occupation, insteadof ceasing, will be prolonged; and may even extend so far as to menace the equilibrium of the States, and even become the cause of a luropean war. It is said there are symptoms of an approaching mnderastanding between Naples and France since the discovery of the plot to assassinate the Emperor. The prisoners Tibaldi, Bartolotti, and Grilli, o2ias Faro, were on Saturday removed from the Prison Mazas to the .Conciergerie, where they were visited by their respective counseL As M. Templier is not able to undertake the defence of Bartolotti, which had been confided to him, that office has been transferred to M. Desboudets. The conference between the prisoners Bartolotti and Gril and their counsel could only take place through an interpreter, as these individuals can only speak ItaliaU Both prisoners have declared to their counsel that they have nothing to add to the explanatious which they gave when before the examining magistrate; that they had, when in London, received money and instructions to make an attempt on the life of the Emperor, but that they had no intention of carrying out the promises which they made. Despatches were received to-day from Vienna, announcing that the Austrian Government appeari willing to make concessions on the question of the Danubian Principalities. The Minister of Marine has commanded that an inquiry be instituted into the causes which led the second officer of the frigate Sibylle to blow hi brains out after a difference of opinion with the captain. It is said that the Abbe Coquereau, Chief Almoner of the Fleet, is to be appointed one of the VicarsGeneral of the Archbishop of Paris. Captain Tardy de Montravel, of the Imperial -Wavy, has been appointed to organize the new penal settlement at New Caledonia. The Emperor yesterday received in solemn audience the Duke de Rivas, who delivered to His Majesty the letters of recall of his predecessor, Marshal Sorrano, as well as the letters which accredit himself as Ambassador from the Queen of Spain to the Oourt of France. The Emperor was surrounded by the officers of the Crown and by the principal persons belonging to his household. Count Walewski, Minister of Foreign Affairs, stood at the right of the Emperor. The Ambassador, in preaenting his credentials, pronounced the following address:- IISiro,-I have the honour to deliver to your Imperial Majesty the letters bywhich the Qaeen of Spain has degnei to accredit me as her Ambassador Extraordinary *ad Pleni. potentiary to your Majesty. I am happy to be the means of conveying the assurance of the high esteem and cordial frLendship of my Sovereign towards your Imperial Majesty, as well as of my country towards the French nation. My happiness, Bire, will be complete if I succeed in meriting your confdence. In the meantime, allow me to offer to your MZJesty the homage of my most profound rwspect. I have also the honour to hand to your Majesty the leers of recall of my predecessor, Marshal Serrano.", The Emperor replied In the following teras "1 Monsieur le Dua,-I have always had reason to be pleased with the persons whom the Queen of Spain ha' appointed to represent her at my Court. I now cowarat. late myself that her confidence has been placed on a person 6o distingtished in every respect AS yourslf. The aamr. rancee wbich you give me of the sincerity of the sentiments of the Qaesn, and of those of the Spanish people, for France, gra.ify me greatly. Be assured tbAt, on my side, no one offers up more sincere prayers for the happines of the Queen, and for the grandeur of the people whom sbe is called on to govern." The Duke de Rivas and the persons attached to his Emba.y were conveyed to and from the Taileries, with the uMal ceremonial, in Court cariages. The Municipal Council of Paris have recently purc}rijed the patent right to use in their city waterWosl &a simple and ingenious English system of cc f-acting suioke-consuming furnace," introduced to the notice of M Jiauseman, Prefect of the Seine, by Mr. Henry Bennett, the owner of the patent for France. The inventor is1 Mr. John Knowlden, a clever English mechanic. About eight monthx ago, at the request of x Haumman, and with the petmiamion of the Minister of Commerce, a furnace wag admitted into Franco, shipped from London. It wax at one erected at the City Waterworks, quai d'Austerlitz, since which, by order of the Prefect, the city engineers have superintended esperiments with English and Belgian coal, with the view of reporting on their reultL. M. Combee, member of the Institute, and President of the Board of Health (Conseil de Salubrit6) were also present on behalf of the Prefect of Police. It was in consequence of these experiments, and on the reports, which state " that the system is completely smoke consuming (comnpement fumivore) and capable of a very remarkable ecnomy in fuel," that the Municipal Council has ratified the purchae made by the Prefect of the Seine, and, under the Presidency of M. Dumas, voted the xum. A report is now under the consideration of the Board of Public Salubrity for enforcing the decrea still in existence for consuming the Ismoke of the capital. Th. machine in question is pronounced to be simple and of easy application. The fire-bar are alternately stationary and movable, with a horizontal and longitudinal movement. Thowe that carry the coal are capable of being raised slightly, and on their return are lowered rather below the level of the stationary bar. The movement is given to the bars by transmission with the engine, and the furnace is fed by a hopper. The door is kept slightly open to receive tha fuel, which is turned into coke near the entrance, and is carried on to the back-bridge in an incandescent state, where the cinders fall into the ashpit. The last system of French invention, that of Beaufame's, which is considered to generate gret steam power, was tried for Bix months at the Paris Waterworks, but was abandoned, owing to the expense of construction and the danger attending its application, being liable to explosion, besides being judged inapplicable to smaller furnaces generally. Though this is the " dead season " in Paris, the cabinetmakers and upholsterersln the Fanbourg St. Antoine have within the last few days received so many orders from abroad that they do not easily find hands to execate them. The paperstainers, bronze manufacturers, and lacemen have likewise received large orders, but the other trades are comparatively idle. No complete return to activity is expected until the end of September. The accounts from the manufacturing towns in the departments representbusiness as generally dull, excoept at Rouen. The manufacturers of Roubasi, Tourcoing, aud Lille are, of course, waiting for orders from Paris. It appears the last season has been a profitable one in these towns. The manufacturers at Lyona have a few orders on hand, barely sufficient to keep their men employed, and they are yet without news from their American customers. Great anxiety prevails at Lyons with respect to the price of raw silk for the next winter. From all we can learn the silk harvest in France is from a third to a fourth les than a fair ordinary crop. Italy does not appear to be more favoured than France ; still there is very little speculation going forward in the article. The mer chants of Paris hoped that the Bank of France would have reduced its discounat this week to 5 per cent., but the measure has again been postponed. The failure of a Greek house,announced in London, aud the large exportation of silver in bas to India, have induced the directors of the Bank of France to observe great caution, although the commercial bils presented for discount gfeatly decreased during the last half of July. The dry and hot weather which we have experienced so long, and which has dried up so many springs, has occasioned a serious rise in the price of flour for immediate delivery, but not on time bargains. There is now a difference of 8f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes between the inmediate delivery price and that for the 2montW of October. The first is 68f. the sack, and the latter 59f. Although the drought has had the effect of raising the price of flour, it has wonderfully accelerated the harvest, which is now entirely gathered in the neighbourhood of Paris. The rise in Slour has given more firmness to the cornmarket. Wheat rose on Wednesday last If. the hectolitre, and was quoted at 37f. the 120 kilogrammes for old wheat. The new grain is from If. to 2f. higher. The provincial corn markets were but moderately supplied last week, and the price of wheat rose. This is not suprising, as the farmers were too much occupied giving the last hand to the harvest to lose their time in attending the markets. The new wheat is generaly of excellent quality, and the yield is in some cases enormous, in consequence of the plumpness and drynews of the grain. The oats already reaped are much Detter than was expected a month since. The barley is shorter and less abundsnt. Rye has fallen a good deal for the last 15 days in this market. The price outside Paris Is 18f. the 116 kilogrammes. Advices from the Bordelals confirm the report of the re-appearance of the vine disease in those vintages where the use of sulphur was neglected. Nevertheless, a good crop is expected, with quality equal to the wines of 1811. In the meantime, prices decline in almost every market. The light wines of the Saone and Loire have fallen 20f. the hectolitre. The accounts from Burgundy are excellent. There are no complaints of the disease. In the neighbouarhood of Paris the grapes are magnificent and abundant beyond example. The vintage wil be 15 days earlier than last year. The Three per Cents. closed to-day at 67f. 30S. for the end of the month, and the Four-anda-Half per Cents. at 93f. 30c.; Orleans Railway Shares, 1,453f£ 75c.; Great Northern, 870f. ; Strasburg, 700f.; New Shares, 680f. * Paris to Lyons and the Mediterranean, 936f. 2§c.; Western of France 732f. 50c. ; Bordeaux and Cette, 682f. 60c.; Great &tral of Franoe, 605f.; Lyons and Geneva, 685f.; Bank of CrSdit Mobilier, 987f. 50Oc.; Austrian Railways, 67f. ; Russian Railways, 518f.

TURrN, JULY 3L The storm raised against M. Rattazzi, the Minister of the Interior, by the Opposition press, continues to howl with unabated virulence in Piedmont. Every aecident or crime that occurs in the country now is quoted as evidence of the Minister's unfitness for office. If a house Is robbed, or a man asaulted, the Minisier is held almost as personally responsible by his political adversaries, and just now they reproach him with shirking his duties because he is pasing the holydays at the Baths of Valdieri, while the Armnia finds inhi, absence from the funeral service for King Charles Albert the other day a convincng proof that ML Rattal's consience makes him fear the canonized bones of his ill-treated Sovereign should burst their cerementa in indignution at the vile conduct of the Demoeratlc Miniter if he were to appear in church on that oecasion. What gives the opponents of x. Rattazs1 an advantage in their reproaches just at preset is, that a band of robbers, supposed to be part of a gang of convicts who escaped from the prison of Genoa some time ago, have been committing great depredation lately in the province Albj not far from the Palace of Poleo, the fsaverife residence of King Victor Emmanuel, and It has consequently been found necsa to incre both the civil sad mnitary power in thoee disrtat. Since thew memures have been taken, horrever, several of these mnalefactors have been arretted, and their capture will no doubt lead to the speedy seizure of their companions, and the re-establishment of security in the province, bu-. this in nowise diminishes the abuse cut on the Minister by his enemies, who are determinea to find fault with him, even for abonting himself half a day's journey from the capital for the sake of his health. M. Mazzini's present paper, the Itdia del Popo70 of Genoa(hix originaljournal there,theIftlia ePopolo, having ceased to exist some months mince) wan sequestrated the day before yesterday, or rather a supplement of it was sequestrated, for an article written by M. Mazzinl himself, entitled " Th) Situation." In this article the author denies th3 inention on the part of himself and friends to plunder in the recent movements in Italy; he main tains that they made no mines; and that the move ment at Genoa was not directed against the Piedmontese Government, but in order to profit by the means of action afforded by Genoa, and to lead Piedmont into a revolutionary war; and he concludes by saying that he will never rest until he has obtained his object. The following extract will give a fair idea of the origlnal:- " The part whiah I took in the Genomee intentions, whether &a chief or moldier, dgnify little. I cn, however, oppose to the bas accations the affimations of one who ha never lied nor conOcmea the truth, not even when it wa i dangerons to tell t, and I do so. 7" It is faise that any part whbatver of the clfy was mined. Any officer interropted wMil state that the pur pose of sacks of powder with matchbs is to blow open door; where it b neceary to fore a pamge. ' It s false that there was any intention to libersat the convict. Special precautions were adopted even to prevenb any attempt at fhligt durng the tumult. " It is fse that there exised orders for plunder. The orders quoted by the Gozetta di Gene either do tot exist o are the work of Ca umnny. It is false that there was a list of the offioers with thelr addresss "It is fam that there was an order of mine (quoted, it I doz't mistao, by the Caeotico) which speaks of the distri bution of booty to be observed by I don't know what National Siety. "It is ale, all acusation, I won't say of muare, bn; of war against the troops. Beddes, if any instruetions of mine or others are brought forward In the prosecution every man my convinoe himself that they insisted on this-no violence; the Piedmoontese soldiers r Italians whos daty it is to fight for the common country. "It is false, that there was any list of proscription. Th3 last llnes written by me preovi to the evening of the 29th will make some of the cauinnators blush if they appear ia the prosecuion. " The design, which did not succeed, and about which ths Piedmontese Government is to-day busying itself, was an Italian design. I think I have no need to prove it Leghorn and the generous aot of Pisacane, attempted with arms psrtly Genoese, sufficiently indicate the tendency o the local movement. Now, It was a harbinger of other ua dertakings, and not an isolated proposition undertaken for itS own sako. And if the Government has sequestraied cokedes, it knows what colours they show.

Itwoould have alenforall; for the worship of the national idea; for wiath long and patiently suppressed against the tyranny exercised by Austria and her Pzo-consuls on Italians; to declare that it also is an Italian city, that it shares the grief, the hopes, the duties, and the shme which weigh upon the hea of enslaved Itay. As Pisa3ane seized the Cagliari, to avail himself o - her for the liberation of the prisoners of Ponza and a descent on the Neapolitan coast, so did Genoa wish that her materials of war, her means of aion, should [be mobi. lized for the benefit of the common country. "This is the truth, andno one can say that it is not." There is nothing very remarkable inx this explanation of tho Rpublica;ucief- The prosecutionabout to take place at Genoa wMil probably prove before long how far he is justified in terming all that has been said of his conspiracy calumnies; but his anxiety to offer a reason for the movement at Genoa agrees with the commonly received account that that attempt was tne result of his own particular plan for forcing the Pledmontese Government into a revolutionar -war, and in opposition to the views of his most iutimate confederates. According to him se'l, M. Mazzini had no desre to -se violence eithe - towards the Piedmontese troops or the town of Genoa-an attack on the outlying posts and a street rlot were to have convorted both to his politlcal theory-the stabbing a sergeant it must be sup posed was merely an excess of zeal on the part of some of his followers, who were over-anxious to make converts among the ranks of the Sardinian army, and the Piedmontese Government was pra. bably to have been won over to hWs views by haviu1 its arsenal plundered and some of its steamers car| ried of, besides the destruction of much other property. It is hardly worth while to speeulat3 on whether such means would be likely to have answered in gaining3 recruits in the Sardinian Governmaent or army for his grand " Idea," had his plans not been bluntly interrupted, but it is quite evident that the city of Genoa itself had no sympathy for his great undertadng, and it will be very long before the Genoese forget the danges to which they were exposed by his patriotic schemes. There have not been any more arrests made lately at Genoa, on ascount of the attempt on the 29th of June, and four or five persons who had been In confinement on supicion have been liberated after due examination. A private letter from Rome says that the misery of the poor there is very great. Bread is represouted to be exceedingly dear, and grain is exported in large quantities, while its importation is prohibited. Recently two ohips arrived at Civita Vecchia, laden with grain. The news soon reached Rome, and the price of grain fell immediately, and the Romans expected to have cheaper bread in consequence, but they were terribly disappointed; for It appeara that the Brothers Antonelli and Messrs. Feoli and Silenzi, who are the great corndealers of the place, managed to send these vessel on to Leghorn, and food remained as dear as before. Commercial men complain much of the vexations to which trade is exposed. Cardinal Antonelli, and his brother, the Director of the Bank, hbave the monopoly of everything, and nothing can be done without their consent. They are at the same time judges and clients in every case of commercial disputes, and it is needless to add they always gain their cause. The Pope is expected back at Rome on the 5th of September. Preparations are already being made for his reAtrn. A the DiplomaticACorps areab sent from Rome, with the exception of Count de Rayneval, the French Ambasador; Signor Mon, the Spanish Minlster; and M. Verger, the representative of the Bavarian Govermment. It was hoped at Rome that the successor of M. Farina as MinIter of War wQuld be one of a. more military turn of mind than the last occupant of the office, who, notwithstanding the eulogies of the Journal des Dftts, is represented by persons at Rome as having been utterly incompetent, and to have left a good round aum of money to his family, although he had no private fortune. lThe Qcifia Cazele of Yerona states that Marshal Radetzky left that place on the 30th uit. for Mian.

Gmm IA BARNAARD.-It wl be learnt with great sa'isfaction that General Barnard has greatly distinguished himself by the militaryeapacityhe has displayed before Delhi. Ee arrived there with aU possible speed by a long forced night marcb, and found that the mutineer, had taken up a very formidable position about two miles in front of the town. Notwithstanding that his men were suffering, ho attacked at once by a bold advance and a skilful flank movement with that hearty will which at once carries sol'iers to victory. The 71st sprang from behind two sanihills where the worn.out men had obtained a brief rest, and immediate suoces crowned the efforts of the soldiers and their gallant leader-the position was carried and occupied, the rebels being driven out wlth great loss General Barnard was complimented by those about him on the achievement due to his aldll; ana in the h&Ay council of ike battlefield was advsed to bring in his wounded, rest his mnen, who were now suffering terribly from over%fatigue, and to retrench himself in tbe excellentposition hb.hd won. Ba- the General turned a deaf ear to every counsel pointed to a ridge outside the town wherethe rebels were ap4n assemblihg, in afew words expressed his will that the ridge should be crriedand the discomfiture of the enemy be oompleted:" If this be not done, they, too, will intrench themselves, and it will cost us three times as much to dilodge them. They are now panic-strackr; but if allowedto hold that place they even might attack us at a disadvantage. No l I am sotry the poor fellows are tired, but they will take the ridgo." Again, animated by their General's will, and guided by consnmnate science, the small and wearied force marched forward with unfailing pluck Again victory was theirs. tbey rushed on the guns with devoted eourae, and captured 26 of the enemy's cannon, and drove him with grt saughter within the walls of Dedhi.-fomning Poe, JAdvert!semeit.]n-st publisbed, ce S d 6., "Letter toVounst PlWermon, 3LG on tbe IMPOPnc* e ct the Bugbr.ten Valley Railway, ana the neoemity ot the rinanewa sopport ot er Maestiy' Government," by W.

T'EA rINITAD TATB& I (nowx OUR OWN OOmOvDnu.1 NEW Yot,~ JULY 22. There is always a part of the American year when politics, bnuiness, and ne cee equally t a standstill. As dog day set in and the fever and ague with the mercury at something a little below boiling heat (Fahrenheit,Washingtonand NewYork become alike uninhabitable. The unusual duration of cool weather this year has postponed tlhi hDy season, but there are unmiatakeable signs in the temperature of tbe last three days that it is close at hand. The negotiations relative to Central America, whichl are nowr going on at Washington, arconse quently rapidly drawing to a close, and there is every reasonable proSpeCt that I shall be able 50021 to annonnce the resiult. The president of the Panama Railroad and other persons interesed In the various Isthmus routes are in Washington, and count upon speedily reaching a conclusion. Ax things now look there is a probability that the difliculties between the United States and the Republic of New Granada will be adjusted, and that some territorial acquisitions will be ceded to this country in the Pacific waters of that republic. It is also said that Great Britain may acquire rhmihr rights; but of this I am not able to speak with the ame certainty. You will wee the allusions to thes negotiations in the excellent speech of Lord Napier at Cambridge last week. On every third year the graduates of the University at that place -the oldest University In the cotntry, called after the University at Cambridge in the mother lsund -have a general gathering, dining, wine.drinking, and speechmaking. Lord Napier was caught this year as the principal lion, and was made to roar in a manner gratifying both to Englishmen and Amerncans. Hlis speech hua made a favourable impreesion here, both as an example of good taste and goodwill. From the ancestral logarithmn to the Centril enerican imbroglios everything was happily touched upon, and in a way to promote good feeling notonlyin the audience that immediately heard it, but in the muchlarger public tbat are still reading: it in the daily journals But, to go beck from Cambridge to Central America, the disposition of the other route from Newr York to California is also occupyingi the atstention of the Cabinet. It is pretty nell understood that the Administration would not view with disfavour the opening of the Tehuantepec route, notwithstanding it croses Meican territory. This has been for some time the subject of consideration at Washington. There Is no railway, nor even a good highway, from ocean to ocean on this route. But, even with the accommodations that exist it would be a great saving in dishnce over the ianama route; and the present Administration wish to have the shortest posible communication with San Francisco. The grant, too, in in the hands of persons not unfriendly to Mr. Buchanan. They have made great eforts to ret Government recon tion and asistance. 'Up to tris time nothing has been done, but the parties are still at Washington. As to the other Isthmus route, that by way of Nicaragua, it is as yet begging the attention of the capitalists without any prospect of getting it this year. Filibuster Walker in sill in the South, his friends giving out much about his plans, prospects, and means. I have seen no reason to change theopinion expressed some timo since, that the Administration are not disposed to aUoir him another chance in the settlemeut of tle compicntions which affct that part of the globe. Eansas ag,ain occupies a prominent position in merican politics. The Free State party refuse to acknowledge the force of the constitutional convention now in sessionX notwrithstanding the assurance of Governor W~alker that the consititution shall be submitted to the test of a popular vote. They persist in their adhesion to the Topeka constitution, and the rebellious inhabitants of Laurence carry their resistance tothe ractical pout of sending the taxgatherer about his buines. At the latest accounts the Governor was on his way there, with seven regiments of infantry, to put down the trouble. Everything now foreshadows a greater struggle there than even the bitter contest of last year. The Government paper at Washington is almost entirel occupied at present in the discussion of this Eses question. In New York it sinks behind the local questions which have occupied their press for some time, but its importance at the capital iY shown by the steadiness with which the columns of the Union are devoted to its discusion. The war of injunctions and counter-injunctions in the mnmicipal administration of New York continuea with unabated fury. The Supreme Court orders Mr. Conover, the Bepublican nominee, into the Street Commisioner's-offlce, and locks Mr. Develin, the Democratic incumbent, in gaol for refusing to obey the order. Thereupon the Common Pleas enjoins Mr. Conover not to do what the Supreme Court commands him to do, and orders Mr. Develin out of gaol, or, rather, issues a habeas corpus, which will result in setting him free. At the same time Mr. Conover is to be arrested for contempt of the Common Pleas Court committed while obeying the Supreme Court; and meanwhile the citizens of New York have to pay both pipers. The poor sheriff seems to havethe most difficult part in the whole play. One pocket is stuffed with the thunder of the Common Pleas, the other with the lightning of the Supreme; and he is commanded by each Court to keep safel7 about him the explosive material of the other without using it. As you watch this wavering and conflict of the Courts you will remember that the Bench of New York is an elective Bench, with short tenure of office. The Bulls were left yesterday in the possession of the stock-market, vith an upward tendency for everything. The bank balances exhibit a favourable condition; the warm weather of the last few days has assured the northern crops beyond reasonable doubt, and there is, I should say, a healthier feeling. I believe I have frequently told you that the stockmarket of New York is not to be taken as an index of the general feeling in the commercial world. The gigantic system of gambling which prevails there has diminished the confidence of the community in the quotations of the Board as evidence of the real value of the securities which they profess to sell. One of the most marked advances of the week, however-that of the New York and Erie shares-is attributable to other causes than gambling transactions. Mr. Charles Moran, the head of the house of Moran Brothers, has accepted the presidency, and Mr. Herman Gelpcke at the same time becomes the treasurer. These changea have revived confidence in the work. The new president is well known upon the continent and in London. He is to devote his whole energies to the administration of the affairs of the company, which certainly needsagreatdealof careandan able head. There is one feature in these appointments which some other companies would do awell to imitate-to a certain extent they may be said to represent the bonded capitaL The debt of the New York and Erie is about $25,000,000. The value of the shares, at the rates of a week ago, was less than $3,000,000; and yet this small sum administers the property, while the holders of the larger sum have nothing to say about it. The correspondents of the new appointees are largely interested in the bonds of the CDompay, so that the injustice of the former state of things is parially remedied.

ELECTION INTBLLIGaYCE. BIRINGHAM. MONDAY EVEUNUG. The supporters of Mr. Bright continue to be remaxrkaN active, and, so far as outward appeaanes go, the lite member for Manchester h the popular anddate. Ak meetlng of his friends ws held at the Hen nd Chickens Hotel this snorniag, and independent of the public ammblage of electors appointed for the Town-hall to-morrow evening, . oommittee was nominated with a view to secure his return.

In the meantime the Consrvatives of irtngbm edre dtoodnottobe lep.

At present SUch an Opponent hasnot appeared, but an idea prevails that, besdes r Whateley, Q.C. o has already been named, itis notnulikelythatMr. atcAiffe, the present Mayor, may offer himself. He is what is termed a Liberal-Conservative, a great patron of the charities of the town, highly popular among al lases, and would, it is thought, prove a formidable opponent to aaw stra;er, howFever deservedly well qdalified, who might Presert himself for election As a Wesleyan Methodi it it alro considered that he would conciliate a lage portlon of the Dissenting interest, while he might relrv upo the support generdhly of members of the estabishment.

Y,BY-AfARKRTatW OA-TYINTELLI( 2JcA. Mondagy Eve-ing. The general doubt. a to the truth of the fall of DOelll caused the Jun&d to open this morning at a. decline of an eighth, asid the market subsequently khowed increased heaviness. The first transactions 1nConsols for money were at901 to W, and the failure of a dealer having then led to a few sle, a further fall took place to 90k. From this there was a slight recovery, the last official price being 90o to i; but after regular hours there were again zellers at 90g. For the September account the final quotation was 91k. The extent to which the estimate of the cost of the inurectien is augmented by all the details received by the last mail-the plunder of the treasuries having according to one statement reached nearly 2,000,(O00.-was among the Causes of the increased heavines, and the news of the modification of the Turkish Winstry, looking at the influence. from which it has arisen, also operited unfavourably. Late in the day it tranBpired that the India Corpany have made a requisition upon the Government for 6,000 additional troops of ail arms, infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with the view of strengthen. ing the forces in Madras and Bombay, which *have been weakened by draughts for Bengal. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 217; Reduced, 91; New Three per Cents., 91 to i; Indis Stock, 214 to 216; India Bonds, 23s. to 17X. diwount; aad Ex. chequer-bills, 5a. to is. discount. The foreign tdock-market continues to be characterized by a total want of animation, and the few transactions that have taken place have been mostly at a slight reduction; The only speculative Wales occurred in Turkish, which closed at a parial reaction upon the late advance. Brazilian J,ve per Cents., 1843, were negotiated at 98; Russian Five per Cents., 1114 ; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98l 4; ditto, Small, 98; Turkish Six per Cents, for the account, 94* a 95; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 64 64* ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 984. The preparations for to-morrow, the 4th of the month, have beea attended with less pressure than had been anticipated, althoughL the payments will be heavy. The supply in the discount-market was in a great degree adequate, and the applications at the Bank were therefore comparatively moderate. In the Stock-Exchange the rate for advances on Goverument securities was still 5i per cent., but they were not in much demand. The corn-market this morning was without alteration. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening Were 67f. for money and 67f. 25a. for the new account at the end of the montb, showing a fractional advance. The specie receipts to-day have amounted to 663,0001. Of this total, 434,0001. (including 327,0001. of silver) is from the West Indies, 225,0001. from New York, and 4,0001. from the leninsula. The gold taken from the Bank to-day was only 5,0001. Further news from Tndia may now be expected at any moment by the Australiaa mail, which was to leave Sydney on the 15th of June. She would touch at Point-de-Galle about the 11th of July, where later inteligence may have arrived from Madras, or she night fa1l in at Aden with any steamer desoatched to that place by the Bombay authorities. The CaradoC, it appears, is waiting at Alexandria to bring any despatchei that may arrive to Cagliari to be transmitted to London by the Sardinian telegraph. One conclusion arrived at from the recent Indian newis is that under any eircumatances the course of affairs in that country must long continue to excite anxiety, and that Consequently the various measures now saggested for its future safety and advanceinent are, perhaps, not likely to be dismissed with the apathy which usually succeeds aU sudden outbursts of rebellion. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that the promoters of each neceseary work will not rely upon this probability, but will aet vhile there is a certainty of being attended to. Happily the new telegraph route by the Euphrates is bemg brought to a practical test, but whether it vill even now be completed before Rusia has constructed her line from Nicholaieff id the Caspian, which many persons believe to be already far advanced, is doubtfuL By a vigorous effort the whole might be rapidlv accomplished, but sinister efforts at Consantinople and elsewhere have to be surmounted, and the promoters of the line are left to contenad with them at their own individual risk. The first efforts to obstruct the enterprise were similar to those which shut out our people from participation in the transit route through Nicaragua. Snakes and earthquakes were in that region to ruin everything, and the wild Arabs were to do dimilar duty on the Euphrates. Intrigues also were set on foot in Turkey to delay or prevent the requiaite concession from being granted, and even to this hour the firman has not been obtained. The company, however, have resolved to act boldly. A fortnight back they despatched a large quantity of telegraph stores to Bagdad, to be followed by a proper staff of officers, and their intention is said to be to construct imnnediately about 40 or 50 miles of line from that city through the very district maost occupied by the tribes whose hostility is as_igned an an obstacle, but whose positive co-operatiou and perfect friendliness are really relied upon. The wire will run from Bagdad to a point on the 1gr of great importance to the noavigation of the native traders, and the belief is that its serviceY will be cordially welcomed. The Turkish Government, it is assumed, will at least give an immediate consent to this experiment. When it shall have been successful any further delay in the completion of the Whole is lilely to be precluded by the force of public opinion. From the Persian Gulf to Kurrachee the link with India is to be completed by a submarine cable laid down by the India Company, and we shall then have a means of instantaneous communication over which none of the natives can ever acquire control. MIeanwhile the question of the Euphrates Railway, which is to be bxought before the House of Commons tomorrow (Tuesday) evening, is entirely in our own hands. The Turkish Government could not be prevented from recognizing the safety and Importance of that enterprise, and they have done their part, both as regards concession and guarantee. The exact amount of specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Ripon is 1,012,9631., of which 843,4451. is for India, and 169,5181. for China and the Straits. Nearly the whole of it is silver, the gold being only 5,3801. It is stated that the East India Company have approved the plans of the Eastern Bengal Railway Company, and that a guarantee of 5 per cent. has been granted on their capital of 1,000,0001. in the same manner as to the otber lines. The route runs from Calcutta through the Delta of the Ganges towards Dacca, and passes in the midst of rich and extremely populous districts. It is understood the Government have thus fAr been unable to obtain any satisfactory information regarding the causes of the delay last week in the Indian telegraph. The director at Trieste cannot give any explanation, except that many messages sent about the same time experienced equal or greater detentioni. A thunderstorm somewhere between Trieste and Munich is still said to have occasioned the interruption. There is, however, a difficulty in accepting this solution. A thunder. storm might stop a succession of messages, but it is not easy to see how, when communication was restimed, it should cause them to arrive in different order from that in which they were originally transmitted. Thus, it seems that the despatch addressed to Lord Clarendon from Trieste at 1 5 a.mn on the 28th of July did not arrive in London till 12 35 p.m. on the following day, while a message drepatched between three and four hours later arrived at the India-house more than an hour sooner. Probably the whole can be made clear, but the sub*ect is hard of investigation, the ways of telegraphs being often as incomprehensible as the majority of messages they contrive to pervert. There is reacon to conclude, however, that if any fault is to be found in the present instance it does not lie with the English company. Thne follow.ing letter from Sir James Carmichael, the chairma of the Submarine line, seems to etsi- bllh that fact. Indeed, Sir James complains that opinions were hazarded of the possibility, unde any circarstances, of hw company bemg in the wrong. In reply, it must be remarked that the only quaegson was whether the delay had arisen from sA1 and UwaToidaUbl coaus or frm WegOt or worsm on the part either of continental officials, or of some one connected with the English company. Thst the Governient did not assume the firt to be necessarly the case is shown by their having instituted an inquiry, and pending that inquiry it would have been too much to demand that auch suspiions as might be entertained should be wholly conCentrated on foreigners. Even if English companies were supposed always to be immuaculate, from the cuairman and directors down to the messengers, it would still be best, especially as regards telegraphtic matters, that the Government and the public, by the exercie of vigilance, should atimulate them to mainai ti purity: nWntain thiB puri"ty,Cornbill, Aug. 3. "Sir,-On reading in tho City Article of The Times of Saturday last your remarks on the delxy in the tranamimion oc the Government telegraphic despatch from India, I was WelerDment have commenced an inquiry on thls uatter, you should without waiting the result of the ofs Investgav tion, zrd opinions that must for the most paut ba bsed upo rumour only, and, witbout seek. ing at i office for information, should proceed to hint tht a suspicion mihbt be attacbed to the directors or servants of this ompany, and suggest a remedy in the formation of 'imilr , aes on a better basis. I now ak you by the publcation of the fohllowing facts (which I am folly preo pared to substantiate) to exonerate the company and Its servants from thit 's spicion.' " The ftrt mesage recived at this offlee respeting the Indian news was addressed to a private individual. It was dated Turin, July 28,1140 a.n. It arrived atl2, and was sent out of this office to its destination at two minutes past 12. The scond masae containing Indian news was dated Trieste, July 28, 10 30 a.m., and was addrsed to .'ze Times. It rived here at 7 50p.m., and was delivered in Printiug Housequare at 8 2.5 p.m. This was a long message of 400 words, and therefore required more time in Its transmission through this office. The third mesae on the sanre subject was also dated Trieste, July 28, 1030 a.m., and was addressedtothe Daily News. It arivedhere at lo 25 .nm. onthefolowing day (the 29Nh of Jul), andwas delivered at the Vaily NZews office at 115 a, m. Ihe fourth destch was addressed to Sir James Melvill, and bore date Trniest July 28 2 30 p.m. Tihat message was transmitted here at U 1 a.n on the 29th of July, and was delivered at !1135 &.m. The fifth was directed to another private in. dividnal, dated Ttiesbe, 1030a.w.,July28, receivedhere at 12 22p.m. the folowig day, and delivered at 12 44. The sith despatch was to Mr. Clarerdon, dated Trieste 115 a.m., Jluy 28, transmitted through this office st 12 35 P.M. of the 29th of July, and delivered at the Voreign. office akt 1- 30. " Bat, Sir. yon staWe tat if a private message had been obtained by the s ame line,' instead of coming from Turin, a gross case of delinquency on tbe part of some one connected with the oompany would have been at once esatIlUhed.' Now, doubtlems the private message from Turin and the Government message from Trieste did pas over the saine wires into this office, although their arrival at and departue from Paris ocourred at very different dates I Moreover, two messages for the press reached London before the dwpatch ddressed to Sir James MelvSII, ad a secoindprivate mesge was transmitted also from Triesto before Lord Clarendon's despatch ! "Thus, your very strorg statement respecting 'gross delinque ncy,' that might be attributable to this company, only proves that The Times is unacquainted with the telegraphic rglations on the continent. " The iubmarine Telegraph Company have no control whatever over mLessges beyond their own lines, and cannot therefore be responsble for delays that occur between Trieste and Cals, or for the sins of omision or commission of Italian, German, or French employ&. AU telegraphs on the continent (with some trin exceptions) are the property of their reepective Geverunntm, and the ranagement of them fors a special department or bureau in the Administration, MKessges from Trieste are therefore transmitted through various foreign offioes before they arrive in Ion- "Of the cause of the delay of the messages to the East India-houe and Lord Clarendon I as yet know nothing, and coaeequently (uni;ke The Times) vwill not bazard an opinion, or even a 'suspicion.' But I do know that during the Crimeat war the Submarne Telegraph wires were not found at fault in their part of the important duty of eonveying the mnessagesof the British Government; and I rasy [also venture to state that since the establishment of our first telegraphic commnnication with France no per-on in the service of this company has hitherto heen suspeckd of betaying the trust reposed in him b; the public, nor has any message been either tampered nish or delayed In any one of our offices, though of course we have been liable to our fair share of delays from acoidental causes, for which we expected and received blarme, " With regard to our own Government, I can say that on severl occasions, with a view to failitate their business, we have offered to lease them an exclusive wire to the continen and when our first cablo was laid down between Dover and CalAs I myself negotiated with the French Government a clause In our concewdon giving Her hajesty's Government the right of priority in sendiug and receinug their despatches " Iregret that absence froma London on Saturday prevented me from inunediately rerplying to youlr sttementi in that day's Tiometd " l am, Sir, your obedient servant, " J. }R CARMICSAEL, {hainnan of the Submarine Teeg6rph Company." Ata meeting of the Berlin Waterworks Company to-day, M. W. R. Goschen in the chair, the report was unanimotuly adopted. A satisfactory progress in the permanent buiiines of the undertaking is stated to have taken place, the contracts for house supplies having considerbly increased. A discussion arose upon the amount of the working expenses for the past half-year-viz., 4,4161. Some of the proprietors expressed their dissatisfaction at the excess of outgoings over receipts, the difference being 5,1321. for the year ending June 30, 1857; while a more hopeful -vew was taken by others, who observed that the earnings already reach fivesevenths of the expenditure-a result rarely attained by similar undertakings in Enrgland, within the short period of the existence of the company. The palace to be occupied by the Prince of Prussia and the Princess Royal will be supplied from these works. The leather-market has become much more animated throughout the week, with an upward tendency, owing to anticipated requirements for the army and general shortness of stocks in the hands of consumers. A treaty of commerce ha been signed between Belgium and Persia. The following is from the United Mexican Mning Company 1- "tExtracts of Despatches from the Commissioners dated Guanaxuato 13th And 27th of June, 1857. "Major F&rrellwrltes,-'Jesu M"arly Jos&.-A6deterloration had oocurred in San Pantaloone and San Maximo from the presenoe of rnbbish and the narowing of the vein, and there was notto the 27th of Juja a return in all these works to their former excellence.' O the 13th of June oajor Farrell writs,-' I am happy to inform you that our works to the south and lowest level abundantly make up for the interruption I have spoken of in the pozo of Dolores, in the freute N.W., and in a new inclined pozo in the direction of S.B. The ore is not less than 6 varsa wide, and In one part reaches 10 varas. The extraction in the week ending the 6th inst. was 1,200 cargas; of this 700 of a ley from 9 to 10 men. per monton, the mema=ng 500 of 5 mes. and upwards, with a good ley of gold, which iincreased the vlueof th erae generally, The quantity of extraction will admit of our selling again in tho course of ten days 1,000 cargas or more, and this consistently with a fell supply to our two haiendas.' He proceeds to say, on the 27th, that in the pozo of San Maximo great Improvement is manifested as the work proceeds downward;a and here good ore Is in the course of extrtion, the vein being 2 varas wide. The general characterof the vein of La Lnt, as shown ina neighbouring mines, is to give its richest deposits at some considerable depth. The general state of the mine is progressive Improvemnent. During the last four weeks the yield has been 4,138 cargas, or more than 1,000 r mas weekly, being 888 cargas in excess of the previous four wzeeks' extraction. This gives a wFeekly profit to the mine of more than $1,000, besides being the source of still further profit on that ,or. tion which. is converted into silver at te two haciendas.' The annexed is from the Committee of Mlexica 'Bondholders : " The committee are without letters from Mr. Whitehead by the Parana. They must have been left behind by some accident.

VICE-ClfNCELLORS'COURTS, Mo'nDy. AuG7.R .3 bMITH V. SMITTf BetForc vce-Chancalor Sir R. T. KmDERRLRV I in tiSs case teorge Smaith, by his will, iner alia, gave as 4?Olow S:-" Itasia 'ckpen, the interest of 400!. for her life, independent of her present or any futurohusband, andat her decease 4001., to be equally divided among her children." Maria Inkpen had a daughter horn in 1819, who died in 3. The mother died in 18x5, aud the dividends had 4een received up to the last half-year. A petition was now presented by tne husband of Maria Inkpcn, claiming the egacy as the personal representative of his deceased daughter, nan the question was whether he was entitled. Mr. Nalder appeared in support of the petition; Mr. Glasse for the reslduary legatee. The VICE-CRANCELLOR said, that the question being -upon the words " eqully divided," he thought the petitioner was entitled. .ANBY V. COLZGaEAVZ This was the petition of the motUer of two infant wards, praying that she might be at liberty to take them out of the juriction of this Courtunder these circumstances .-It nppeared tuat their father had been long dead, that he aas a Roman Catholic, and their mother a Protestant. There was isnue of this marriage, the two wards, the objeots of the present application. One a son, Francis, born in 3849, and the other a daughter, Mary, born in 1850, both being educated as Roman Catholics, and Dlr. Marlby, a Roman Catholic, was the testamentary guardian. Evidence ass adduced to prove that the son was liable to attacks of illness of a pulmonary nature, and had been taken toTorquay, lut the air of Devonshire was thought to be too damp, and there was a certificate of Sir James Clark, stating that it would be of the greatest service for the preventlon of the attacks of illness to pass the ensuing winter in a mild climate. Mr. Baily and Mr. H. Clarke appeared in support of the petition. Mr. FLR3MzaG appeared for Mr. Aanby, and said that this matter was quite in the discretion of the Court. The only objeotion ho had to make to this petition wsn, that it was intended to take both infants out of the jurisdiction, the application being founded on the {I-health of one. The YICB-ChANcELLor said that with regard to the son, there was not the slighest doubt that it was a fit case for ic to go abroad for the benefit of his health. With regard to the daughter there wais no si'ich necessity, and although the Court was very unwilling to allow wards to be taken oat oa their jurisdiction, yet if they did go, what could be so proper as that their motber should go with them, and the uply question was whether, the daughter being of tender age, the family sbould be separated, This lady had acted so cpndidly and behaved so well that implicit confidencee must beplaced in her word, and on her undertaking to give them the benenit of Roeman Catholic instruction during their aBsence, and udertaking to bring them back wvithina time named, the order might be made. (Beforc Ve-Chancdcor, Sir W. P. WoOD.) THlE LZOlILNSTER CANAL NAVIGATION C031P,&SY V. THE SHREWSBURY AND SIXERFORD RAILWAY cOxsrAiqyi The VICE-CH'ec.nCLLo, gave judgment in this cse. l'he bill was tiled to obtain specific perfornanceof an agreenient by the defendants for the purchase of the Leo. sriuster Canal for the sum of 12,0CO1. Anagreement-for the archaso of the canal was come to in 1846, while the Shrewsbury and Hereford Bailway Act, 1846, was before P?arlia. ment. Pursuant to one of the provisions in the agreement thbe Leominster Canal Sale Act, 1847. was obtained, by which the railway company "were authorized and required, 'with the consent of at least three-fifths of the proprietors, at a meeting to be specially held for the purpose, to purchase the Leomister Canal." In 186P, at a meeting of the railway company, specially held, it was resolved with the consent of more than three-fiftbs of the proprietors that the purchase should be completed, and a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to complete the purchase. Some correspondence had taken place as to difficulties in the title, but the solicitor of the defendants wrote in 1854 stating that the directors were disposed to accept sach conveyance as could be made, and to pay the sum agreed uTon so soon, as the amount could be realized by the sale of shares. The purchase not having been compkted the plaintiils had filed their bill for specific performance, which was resisted .en the gronnd that there was no contrct under the corporate sl,or signed by two directors, so as to be binding upon the railway company within the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act. His HOOIJR;, after stating the case, said that it was settled that before the Act incorporating a railway company had passed the directors could not do that which they had no power to do subsequently to their incorporation. A r.bacse of the canal in 1846, after the paEsing of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway Act, was clearly ultra ir-es, and the directors could not bind the shareholders thereto. No conditional agreement sigped by the directors Wad been obtained, to the effect that in the event of the Act of 1847 passing they would bind the shareholders as to completing the purchase. Then what was the effect of the Act of 1847, to which the railway company gave their aesent under their corporate seal? The dause (ehe effect of which hls been arendy stated) was remarkably worded. It did not recite the previous agreemert, nor did it appear from auything therein contained that there was any binding agreement in existence. He mnight obeerve, howvever, that it was the strongest case he had ever seen of a public company declining to fulfil their contract. The meeting was called expressly in accordance with the provisions of the Act on the 7th of July, 1852, and a resolution was passed t9 authorise the purchase at such time and on such terms as to the directors shaould eenm fit. It had ocurred to him how far, this having been done with the consent of three-fffths of the proprietors, the company were bound under the words "are hereby authorized- and required" to complete the parchase. Two difficulties, however, were In the way-6rst, attowhether this was the proper Court for enforcing the conteatt; and, secondly, that thoerailway company hadleft tbse matbter to he settled by~ their 'direotors; and. this must be taken to be in aecordance with the provisions of the Le.nds Clauses Aet only. As suggested by Lord Cottenha.m i " Adams v. the London and Blackwall Raiway Co-an pany" (6, Railway Cases, 286), it was extremely 'doubtful whether this Court could grant specific performance, and whether the company ought not rather to be directed by a snondamus to proceed with the purchase at the price specified. Unless the agreement was brought before the Court i*athe form of a contract complete modo etfo-nd,underthe Lands Clauses and Incorporating Acts, he could not grant specific performance. kle might observe that solicitors acting for railway companies must feel themselves placed in a ,most painful position, when it was shdwnS here, asc in other instances, that no reliance could be placed on the good faith or even upon the commron honesty of the directors. They had at thls moment the power of completing the purchase, but if they refused to do so he oould not in this case compel them. With respect to the objections as to title, he could not say that tbey bad been conclaEively waived,though it appeared that the refuasal to complete thecontract was not v*on this ground. The bill must be dismissed, but without costs. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Dickinson, and Mr. SLallard appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Ralt and Mr. Giffard for the defendants, the]rs.ilway company. LEES V. JONES. Mr. CARNs (in the absence of the Attorney-General) replied in this case, which, as we have already stated, comes before the Court by adjourrment from chambers upon a stmnmopstaken ori by one of the defendants heeding an order for the dissolution of the partnership an a sale of the collier', for the appointment of a manager for the (Qharober Colliery Cawpany, and a direction for such manaever in his courso of working to cut through the " Oak l'sult ' in the pleadings mentioned. - The VxCE-CHANcEjLLoR, said that the ease, as opened by the Attorney-General, was-placed upon the ground that the colliery could not be sold as directed by the order. It 'id not appear, ho wever,, that any impossibility as to effectipg a sale bad been shown. A sale by private contract was open to the parties, and until it was concldvely showvn that a sale could not be wade the application for the ap- Iointment of a mlanager wa s omewhat premature. The main question, however, which had been raised, and as to wbich alone there vas any difference of opinion, was as to cutting through the fault. When the case was first before the Court the great'3anaority of interest was in favour of cut-. ting through he faiult. The plaintin, however, had since acquired by purchae the majority of the shares, and 'were now the rePrentatives of 27 out of the 31. They were filly-entitled to ask that thisi question might not now, until there had beer, a sale, be determined once for. aLl The do. fe,x4nt, Mr.Miar8land, had tahenuostepe mnclnjh.de no applicationon the subject from January untili May, but ia thze meantime the othier shares had been purchased by the, ptais4iffs, thus chianging the position in which he stood at te institution of the suit. lt was oxs this ground in reality, ttt.hi*Application was made, and not because his iateresto w~oud be urretrifvably injured by the Quspension of this y,uticular course of worok until the siale The present' was not ut all: a coutventent time' roei'tenmilki the qnPeredon, and until it was asoertain.&,'whether there coultd oe sale or -not the matter pught to rema!a in St1'u quo.

IN TESIE MANTi OCF TuIEH ra nUEIAL BoAlS. This was a petti*et by the Egham Burial Board'that they might be authorired and empowered to appropriiate nd ~ake aportioneof kand called the Sandpit AUotment, on Eugletield-cominen, to the extent of four acres. The questiOn which arose upon the petition was whether there had been an "approval by the vestry" vwithin see. 2) of the -Br1-c~h2 (15th and f6ih of Victoria, cap. 85). At a vestry held on't he 17th of April, 18 a'a repoirt` *its ,received from the burial board as to 'the site of land (the Sandpit Allotment) selected fot the burial grourid, the report stating that nothing would have to be pid fo the land. It was resolved at this meeting of the vestry that !the site proposed should be adopted & further meeting ! wzs held on the 9th of December, and a resolution havin been'putAnd lost, 'which would have the effeci'of rescinding the resolution of the 17th of April,-ain mendment was csarried to the effect that there was no reason for rescinding the resolution of the vestry of the 17th of Ap ril as to the tsite of the new cemetery. A petition had been rendered necessary from the land in question beiDg charity land, and upon adjournment into Chambers it was proved that the hbnrilsl boatd were ander a misapprebension when they 1stated in their report that nothing would have to be paid ifor the site. A meeting of the vestry was held for the purpose of obtaining their approval under this new state of ciroumstances. An amen(i meut was proposed to the effect that the sandpits were unfit for a burialground from their proximity to the national school and other habitations, IThis amendment, tho-a-h lost at the vestry, had beenecar. ,ried by a poll, of the whole body of ratepayers, wihich-had been demanded and held. The burial board hid obtained the sanction of the Poor Law Board, the Charity Commissiouers, and the Secretary of State, and the nuestion was 'whether there had been an approval by the vestry. Mr. BOVILL, in support of tho petition, oontended that there had been no formal rescinding of the resolutiogs of the vestry in April and December, 1856, *pprovg the site proposed to be appropriated. Mr. Giffard, for the respondents, was not called on. The Vicg*CIIACEgLLon said that it 'was impoii3ible to make any order u"po the petition. or to hold that there hadbeen an "-approval by the vestry" within see 29. -The consent to theappropriation given in April, 1856, couldnotbe of the slightest value, having been made upon what proved to be an incorrect statement of the facts. as to the payment for the land. At. the same time no wilfult misrepresentation or any impropriety could be attributed to the burial board 'who had been borne out as to their choice of site by the Poor Law Board and the Charity Commissioners, He saw *no benefit either In putting the parish into a commotion as Ito raising a rate to pay the costs (the buriil bnaud havig no ;property whatever), and the petition must be dismissed without costs.

In 1853 the insolvent was discharged vuder the Act. He had already been six months in prison. About August last he called on Mr. Jones, the attorney for Mr. Betteley, about some property in Shepherd's.bush, on whick some money was wanted. In a day or two afterwards he brought two bills, which were discounted. They were represented as good bills. The parties whose names were on the billi turned out not to be in a situation to pay. The insolvent alleged that he bad done work for some, and he himself wanted to raise money. With one person he had exehauged acceptances. The insolvent alleged that his account books had en destroyed by fire. - Mr. MAC.sct contended that the debt with Mr. Betteley had been incurred by fraudulent representation abouF the propvextyr at She,pherd s-busb. u The CmLP CommissioNXR thought that there waz no raee of fraudulent representation, but-at the Eame time was of oiniono that the insolvent~was not justified in circulating the ilisbe bad, with the partiesn tnaes thereon.

It appeared that the prosecutor is a sergeant of police at Keswick, nd on Saturday night, the 2d'of !ay last, about o'clock, e was attracted by a greaktcrowd in the maia eet, near the house of a man named John Robinson. Ou oceeding there he found that a man narlied Clark Cockbainad been caried into Robinson's house in a state of insensibility. He was lying on tbree chairs,'bleeding from A ound on his head near his right eayr, pale and insensible rem information that he then' receiv'ed that the pri- oer had inflicted this wound onx C6clkb&Mn andl be. lieving the Man to, be very seriously injured, Bird, ccompanicd by a policeman named Bowman ceeded to search for -the prisoner. About half.past 10 'olook that night they found him at his mother's ouse In Keswick, seated before the fire wiha formidable ick in bis rigbt hand. Sergeant Bird; charged him with he assa.vlti gn ockbain, and tbld him lie raust take him ,nto custody. The prisoner . immediately jnumped up and -sd evra- polic'eman should take him, and -raised stick to strike Bird. Bird seised his upraised arm.. The prisoner immediately raised his other arm and Aimed a blow pt Bird's breast, and then for the first time Bird saw in his ppitdhand a large knife, like a butcher's knife. The risoner rwas in the act of stabbing the prosecutor with this ife when the other pollceman jumped forward and paught he prisoner's wrist in his handl, preventing the blow-r he preffect, altbisogh the point of the knife pene. }rated through the prosecutor's "oat at -the breast. The rosecutor then got hold of the prisoner's hand which eld the knife, and endeavoured to wrest tha knie from , tihe Prisoner Inrlously resisting and doing his best so Fut him aId in this Struggle the prosecutor received six ,ut on one-hand and two on the other. John Robinson proved that about 8 oclock that night he heard the prisoner making a great noise in the *tree& before his door, and Mr.- Clark Cockbain rewnonstraftlng with him. He then saw the prisoner raise ir very thick cudgel be had in his hand And strike ckbain a blofw on the head with it, which knocked bn downinsensible, and he was cartled into witness's house in that condition, and there Sergeazit Bird saw him, nd witness told him what he had seen, Afterthe-blow the risoner walked off. On cross-examination of the witessex it s elicited that the prisoner had' been'a soldier at he Crimea and that he had been wounded twice, once on thehead, and thathe hada medal and -two clasps and a pension; and that he had had some drink thAt might.- The prosecutor apprehended him without a warrant, The learred COU2fSEL for the prisoner submitted the ap-. irehension wasnot lawful, the constable not having seen he assalt, and acting Twithout wirrant. Hi s LonususP overruled the objection. The constable had seen Cockbaiu lying insensible with a wound on his ead, and had received information that the prisoner had niictedit. A constable had lawful authority to appresend on the mere suspicion of a felonycommitted. _ hr.D Dviaso's then addressedthejuryfor -thedetence, tabmittiog that at most the prisoner's offepoe wa only ihs mirdemetnour of attempting to stab the prosecutor, as the woounds inflicted ou Bird's hands were inflicted in ths itruggle to-get the knife from him. His LoRDSnIIP having summed up, The jumy found the prisoner Guilty of the attempt to dtab. Mr. FOSTZR said, with his Lordship's sanction, he should d6ot now think it necessary to proceed with the other charge againrbthe prisoner, of wounding Clerc Cockbain with intent to do him grievous bodily harm.L I HIS ORDSHP -thought justice wrould be satisfied with the ver4et inthe case tried as it wras the worse of the two. I HiS LOanssn in pa g sentence said, the prisoner had I been conicted on the clearest possible evidence of a diabolical atterpt to v7Ound an officer of jestfe, and, had 1S hand not been arrested, he might have stood at the bar on a charge of murder, and the probabUity was that his liFewould have paid the forfeit of his crime. That he intended to prevent his lawful apprehension and to do grievons bodilyharm, he bad not theslightest doubt When Hee* men were discharging their arduous duties, he could not allow it to go forth that people were to reist their lawful appihnaion. Had the' prisoner been convicted of the eony charged he shoould have passed a very severo entence upon him. The lawa did not permit bm. to pass upon him a verysevere sentence for the miasderneanour of which e had been found guilty.- The sentence of the Court was that he b imprisoned for 18 calendar months and kept to bard 1-abour. Charles de Neur, aged 33 who desezibed himnelf as a trench soldier, was convicted'of endeavohrinx to obtain a tun from Mr. krwin Walls, gunaimth, of Wigton, wit intent to defraud. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and tHlis LoRDsHiP sentenoed him to be ilmpisoned -four calendar months.~ ~ ~ ~ wth -The prisoner, who is a in]!, mnititary-lool;ing man with a large moustache, on hearing the sentence, uttered a furious ' acr6-s-r.r/" as he was being removed from the dock.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. I Sir-As an old Etonian, and havin a son at that school, I could not but peruse yonr able articfe of the 30th of Juy Vith very great interest, and thoroughly agree with you -n all that you urge on tbe subject of publioschools contending, with o;e another in manly games. I think the law which, it appears, Dr. Goodford hea Iid down, that Etomanos during their hu,lydays are to be prohibited &om playing at Lord's, is most overbearing, and I ,uestion what legal right he has to enforce its observation. Hemay with as much juetice attempt to prevent Etonijka going to the theatres or appearing at any public place of amusement.I I hear it also stated (I trust this Is not true) that Dr. Goodford has intimated to the captain of the eleven, who has just left school, that if he should play in any match at Lord's he is never to be allowed to take Any partin matches that may hereafter be played at Eton. This is so utterly at variancoswith the character of an Englishman that I hope Dr. Goodford wil be found to give an unqualified denial to Ithis report. Ido iot enter into this discussion from any personal feesng, for I am sorry to way my son is no cricketer, my sole reason for writing these lines is that 1, with you, regard this As a national question. I would therefore venture to propose this plan,-that bll old Etonians who. coincide with your view of the cma thould send their names to you, in- order that they may be attached to a protezi against Dr. Goodford's arbitrary pro ceeding, And if you will undertake to print them from time to time I do not doubt that you will have a long list of influential names to publish. But as this will occupy some valuable space in your pa I hope you will allow me to enter my name as a subscrib or-any sum not exceeding 1t. towards the expenseg of this, and I trust that numerous old Etonians wil act upto this J. would gdly sign my name to this, but that Iam apprehensive of what the consequences might be to my son for his larent's thus venturing to denounce Dr. Goodford's conduct. Itherefore enclose my card, and with my best thanks to X on for having taken this matter up, I remain, Sir, your verv obedient servint- AN ENGLISH GENTLE2AN. ICax1ton Clb, .Aug. ~

RnTUSAL OF ThE PBESIAN GOVER2NMUENT TO EVACUATE HERAT.-WO have good reason to believe that the intelligence of onr Indian troubles has reached Herat I and Teheran, and has had the effect there that might be expe¢ted. The Indian papers mention that information had b received at Bashire that the Persian Commandant at Heaat bed refused to evacuate that place or acknowledge the treati. It is said that a messenger has been despatched byMr. Murray, and has reached Trebizond, who will convey to our Government a distinct intimation that the terms of the late treaty as regards Herat have no chance of being fufild.-''The affairmay-very well tide over for tho present, but as soQn is the #retched mutineers are disposed of in India,,and 'a sufficient force is collected in Peshawar, it would eb a ise step to advance at once from thence upon Hlerat; and diipose of that place as may be deemed best.
