MOA.IVY-.M AREKTand CITYINITELLIGENOB. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 5 per mrle premium, and the short exchange on London is 262) per ll. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. IO1d. per ounce for staudard gold it appears that gold is nearly 4-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424, per mark, andthe short exchange on London is 13 i per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 3-lOths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is about 1071 per cent., which, when compared with the Mlint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange iz against England; but, after mnking allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmision of gold either wav between the two countries. In consequence of the expectation of an immediate advance in the Bank rate of discount the funds opened heavily this morning at a further decline of an eighth, and, although there was subsequently a recovery, it was not maintained to the termination of business, the market closing very heavily in consequence of numerous sales of securities on account of parties at Liverpool in receipt of further adverse news from America by the Baltic. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 89i to 90, but there were as usual several orders on the market for purchasers at 90, and the execution of these caused a temporary rally to 90 to i. After regular hours, however, telegraphic inteligence to the effect that thePhiladelphia and Baltimore Banks have suspended, and that several additional failures have taken place in those and other principal cities of the Union, caused a relapse to the opening quotation. For the 10th of November the latest price was 90i to #. In consequence of the purchases on the part of the public in the early part of the day there was no pressure for money in the Stock-Exchange, loans on Government securities being obtainable at 5 per cent. In the discountmarket there was a full, but not an excessive demand. The knowledge that further large sums of bullion were in course of withdrawal from the Bank caused, however, considerable anxiety. India Stock left off at 208 to 210; India Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 7a. to 3s. discount. The foreign stock-market hasshownmore activity, and there has been a greater tendency to enter into speculative transactions. The news from Spain of the downfall of the Warvaez Cabinet has exercised little effect upon Spanish. Brazilian Five per Centa., 1829 and 1839, have been negotiated at 99k; Guatemala, 50; Mexican, 21 and i; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 541; Russian Five per Cents., 109 ; ditto, Fotur-and-a-Half per Cents., 981 and 99; Spanish, 40k; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25i , i, and i; Turkish Six per Cents., 95; ditto, forthe account, 95 and 94i; French Three per Cents., 681; Dutch Two-and-aHalf per Cents., 65i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no change of importance from the rates of last post. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 5c. for money, and 68f. 25c. for the end of the month, showing a further relapse of a quarter per cent. About 88,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to- day for exportation toethe continent. It is assumed that the stoppage of the Philadelphia and Baltimore banks, telegraphed this afternoon, is the result of a joint resolution on the part of those institutions for mutual preservation from the consequences of an indiscriminate panic. Sbould such be the case, the step, instead of causing an increase of distrust, may assist in promoting a restoration of confidence. There are certain conditions under which no banking establishments can stand, and it will soon be seen if these have been the cause of the present movement. The immediate effect will be to cause bills on these cities to be sold at New York and elsewhere at a heavy discount, and that most of the specie in circulation in Philadelphia and Baltimore will be sent away to purchase them. The stock of bullion at other points will therefore be proportionably strengthened. The event, consequently, instead of causing a further fall in securities, may operate in ai opposite direction. "With regard to the fresh failures reported on this occasion, the principal at Philadelphia seem to have been Caleb Cope and Co. and ilallowell and Co., both importers of manufactured goods. During the relapse a hich occurred after the termination of the great A merican panic in 1837 the Philadelphia and Baltimore banks suspended, as in this ;nstance, while those of :New York steed their *^round. At that timo their course had been radically unsound, and a long peried elapsed before they were able to resume. In the present case no widespread commercial inflation hass been observable, and there is room to hope that the difflculty will be speedily surmounted. The Persia is the next steamer to arrive, and she may be looked for on Saturday afternoon. An extraordinary Customs fraud, jUst described to have taken place at Belfast, seems to show considerable official laxity, together with a marvellous readiness on the part of a number of people to act as unpaid accomplices, after the manner of the twvo clerks lately sentenced to the Perth Penitentiary, in connexion with the embezzlement from the Commercial Bank of Scotland. From a statement cf one of the Belfast paperS it appears that a teadealer named Moore had let some premis' a in the rear of his office for the purposes of a bonded saore. Moore contrived to get a key to this store, and having access to the yard at all times has pursued the practice for upwards of a year of entering the place after th*X outer oflicial gates were closed, and helping himse f to such supplies of tea as he might deem expedient, filling the emptied packages with bricks and other rubbish. In this way a quantity has been removed, estimated at the value of from 10,0001. to 12^,0001. When the discovery took place it seems to have been made a subject of gossip long before any active steps were taken, and meanwhile MIoore absconded. Some of his assistants, however, were forthcoming, and these persons appear to have avowed their perfect coAgnizance of what had been going on, as if the idea that they ought to have refused to have anything to do with it had never suggested itself to their minds. Andrew Harbison, formerlya traveller in the house, Will1iam Kennedy, aclerk, and John Robb, a porter, together with Mrs. McClelland, an old housekeeper, were examnined. Harbison knew all about the false key, and Kennedy, although less communicative, was apparently not muchbehind him in information. Robb, the porter, had actually made himself handy in helping to remove the paekages,and an a pprentice named Blake only two months previously had emigrated to America so as to avoid being called upon whenever an exposure mnight occur. In fact, Mr. Moore, if the story is correctly told, seems to have scorned the thought of taking any particular precaultions, and to have carried on his proceedings as if he were confident of the sympathy and concurrence of every one around him. At present Robb, the porter, is stated to be the only delinquent detained in custody, but unless the others are necessary as Queen's evidence it will be a great injustice to the cormmercial body iE they are not all prosecuted with as much s,everity as possible. As to the A_AtA A_7 A __ __ 17 > the gross carelessness on the part of the warehousekeeper and the Customs' officers, w' ch could permit a private door to remain on the premises capable of being opened by a single key, some explanation will probably be offered.
RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Tuesday Eventng. The fall in railway shares yesterday has continued to-day, and a further considerable decline has taken place. After official hours the market was still further depressed, and closed heavily. Great Northern receded, notwithstanding the late firmness caused by the purchases of the company to absorb the stock fraudulently created by Redpath. Grand Trunk of Canada declined during the day, a transaction having been marked at 42i, but afterwards partially recovered; the debentures and Great Western of Canada boncs -were also lower. wrench shares generally improved on the receipt of better quotations from Paris, but the highest prices were not fully maintained. Lombardo-Venetian again advanced, at one time touching 4i premium, from purchases on foreign account. American descriptions show no variation. In mines the principal business was in St. John del Rey, which closed 11. higher; and a reduction occurred in Cobre Copper. In joint-stock banks there was no alteration. In miscellaneous securities, Australian Aaricultural and Electric Telegraph receded, while the closing price of Peninsular and Oriental Steam shows ar advance of 11. (n)RllMA RV QW^t^Om CANALS.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE, WRLLANT. This railway is intended to oonnect Lake Erie with rAkG Ontario, passing along by the side of the Welland Canal. It commences opposite the terminus of tho New York Cen.u tral and Erie Railway, and runs on the summit level about 12 miles, thenco it descends 336 feet to Lake Ontario, in a distance of 25 miles. The report of the directors states that; at present the course of trade has been diverted from its na&tral channel by the New York Central Railway running by the side of the Erie Canal fronm Buffalo to Albany. Tbe directors c^ll upon all wha feel an interest in the route by Lake Ontario to nnito thetr efforts in assisting thenm to regain the traffi. The opinion of tho Board of Trade at Oswego is quoted in favour of the undertaking. The report states that the capital stock of the company was subscribed last year, andc consisted of 7,000 shares of 201. lls. sterling each. OE those, 2,055 shares, or 42,2301., had been paid up ia full in Canada, and 215 shares, or 4,4181. in England, and 45 per cent. had been called up on the remainder of the shares. Contracts had been entered into for the completion of the line, four-fifths of the amount being payable li bonds of the company at 6 per cent interest, pay able in London. The capital of the company had beeui increased to 205,6004. by the amended charter, to cover the cost of construction, including rolling stock, andI warehouses repuired to accommodate the expected addi. tional traffic in grain, &.. It appears that the whole character of the road has been changed since the report im 1866, which limited the traffic to light and valuable goode and the local trade. The cost of the transit of a bushel of v heat from lake to lake is estimated at about a halfpenny, and the profit at ld. per bushel, which is expected by th@ promoters to yield an arnple return for the capital. The report of the engineer states that the works have made rapid progress daring the season, and may be finished by the opening of the navigation. TBRA C RETURNS. Mlle PA- M6r- Tol.

CoFFEE.-The auctions to-day were large, comprising 400 casks and 600 barrels and bags olantation, 630 bags native Ceylon, 382 bags Costa Rica, 545 bags Brazil, and 174 bales Alexandria Mocha, nearly the whole of which wav. withdrawn; the smaU portion of the plantation sold were of gray descriptions, which weent at Is. to 2s. per cwt. de* ollne-viz., 68s. 6d. to 71s. for fine to fine fine ordinary. The Brazil was taken in at 53s.; the MIocha at 65s. for Poddy; and the Costa Rica chiefly at 70s. to 72s. per cv;t. RICE. -The sales were unusually heavy to-day-18.500 bags; but there was sufficient demand to take off all thez better descriptions, particularly the 5,000 bags good and fine Bengal, at 1is. 6d. to 14s. 6d., which was dearer; 1,364 baus broken white were bought in at lls. 6d., but gubsequentjy sold at 11s., a full price; 3,811 bags Java were withdrawn, with the exception of a small pile of good, disposed of at 14s. Gd. to 15s., at 12s. for inferior, and 13s. 6d. for mid. dlins. The remainder was Madras, of which only abonb 1,300 bags sold, at lls. 9d. for fine quality. SALTPETRE.-2,900 bags Bengal were brought forward to-day, but only a small portion sold,-11 per cent. at 57s. to 57s. Gd., and 134 per cent. 56s. 6d. to 57s., being Is. 6d. to 2s. per cwt. decline; 250 bags Madras sold at 50s. 6d. to 52s. for 22i per cent. to 204t per cent., and 270 bags Bombay at 49s. 6d. for 37i per cent.

LEATHER AjE HIDES.-Tho leather-market at Leaden. hai to-day has been only moderately supplied with fresh goods. The articles mostly in request were crops, dressing hides, medium and ight skins, also kips, offal, and shoulders. There is no alteration to notice in lEnzlisli and foreignl butts or horse hides, and prices generallyihave undetgone hittle change since last week. Market hides werep in good supply, with a languid demand, at about late rates, The quality is now becoming , ery good.
STATB OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, OcT. 6. The market to-day is exceedingly firm in all departments; but there is no great business doing in any description of goods or yams. The rise in prices in Liverpool has caused an advance of about Jd. per lb. in yarns since Friday, and this has, no doubt, had the effect of limiting the amount of transactions; but the opinion appears to prevail that rates must become still higher. Manufacturers are not now disposed to make any concession from their latest quotations, or there would probably be a good deal of business done at the rates current last week. There are reports of three or four failures in the silk trade, for from 30,0001. to 40,0001. in each case, and the particulars will probably transpire to. morrow. Messrs. John Slagg ard Co. report as follows " There has been a good demand during the week for the betee qualities of 40-Inch shiktingr, and an adnr,ne of lid. to 3d. per pleceon the prices of Tuesday last 6i now readily obtaned. For nearly a I other descriptions we bave a very quiet mahkt, but, acs tocks ae light and the price of cotton again tending upwardr, there is no girioG way in rice." LEEDS, OcT. 6. A moderate amount of cloth has changed hands in the cloth-halls this morning, and there Was nothing either as to price or the aspect of the market deserving of notice. In genieral terms it may be stated that the market was about the same as last week, and as good as was expected. EHTDDERSFIELD, Ocr. 6. The market is generally quieter. There are many strangers in, but the operators are cautious, and the transactions limited. The latter appear to be chiefly confined to low woollens, cottons finding a much less ready sale. Wool nearly stationary-if any change, a slight tendency to advanco.

b 3MISSIOIN" IBS IX' INDIA. The followin:g Minute of the Church Missionary societv on the Indian Mutiny in its connexion with (sriatian missions and the futuire government of India upon Christian prinoiples has been forwarded to us for publication:_ "4 The oommittee have published from time to timne the 'ihIef articles of intelligence which have been received from the missions of the society in India since the lamentable outbreak of rebellion in the Bengal Sepoy army. But the period has now arr,ved when it becomes right that they should put before their friends the view they take of its inlflence upon missionary operations, and of Its results upon the future relations of India with the Christianity of our country. " Tho committee conceive that such a statement is espe-dIlUy caUed for, in the prospect of a day of public humiliatlon, in which, as a nation, we are called upon, by our Supreme Governors, to ' humble ourselves before Altaighty ,God in order to obtain pardon of our sins; and in the most devout and solemn manner send up our prayers and supplicat!ons tothe Divine Mlajesty for imiploring Fis blessing and mamistance on our arms, for the restoration of tranquillity,' " The committee, therefore, at once take their stand upon the obvious and all important truth, that God has a controversy with our land, and therefore has visited us with this Jcr. meat. " This one cons;deration leads the thoughts of Christian people above (Iue-tions respecting the alleged faults of Go. veinment, or mi.takes of civil policy, or of the military department, to fi, our contemplations upon our national reslons1bilities. The judgment is a national one, not only in the sense in. wbhihh an insult to our flag, or an outrage upon -our territory, may be so called; but because it has inflicted sa outrage and insult, unparalleled in our annals, upon our national honour, in its tenderest point,-namely respect for our women and children. i. " Amid many national sins and shortcomings, therefore, of which our country has been guUty in the sight of God, we annst especially look at this time to our relations with Britih India^, and our responsibilities, as a nation possessing in the providence of God the supreme authority formerly 'exercised by Ilindoo and hahosuedan Powers; this power haa been transferred to us a Ch-isti3n nation enjoying the 3ight of revealed truth, with its inseparable obligation to impart that ligbt to I every creature. H'ere the broad fact stands out to confront us, that -India has been lyiDg passive at the feet of Great Britain lor the greater part of a century, receiving the benefit of a just government, and of extended commerce, and many other temporal advantages. But two generationsat least of her teeming millions have been allowed to pass away mataught in the saving truths of Christianity. While tens of thousands of England's choicest sons have flocked to India to reap a harvest of temporal wealtb from the labour 3nd skill of the natives, only a few Christian teachers have been sent out, in numbers utterly insignificant, compared -with the work before them, to reap fields white with a spiritual harvest of iumiortal souls. The guilt of these neglected responsibilities must be divided between the Government of British India and the -Christian churches of Great Britain. For a long periodthe Indian authorities wonld allow no Christian missionary to reside within their territory. They compromised themselves with Hindooism and the Mahomedan imposture; and this under the profession of neutrality in respect of all religiors. Of late years this policy has been happily modified; connexion with idolatry has been for the most part severed. Iklisssons have been freely tolerated, hut the Christian con. version of the natives has been discouraged, and the prin. -lpie of neutrality is still professed. The Christian Church shared in this guilt. lor a long time she lifted up no proteSting voice, and neglected the spiritual interests of India. She has awvakened fro her guilty lethargy, bat has not risen to the occasion. It was indeed her voice which preavalled over an unwilling Government to open the door to 2nissionaries, and to separate itself from many abominations, but she has not taken full advantage of the opportunities thus gained, but has halted in the subsequent discharge of her own appropriate duty. " If it should be asked, why the judgment has been sent, mot in past seasons of guilty neglect, but now, after both the Government and Christian people have begun to amend their ways, it may be observed, that this is in the way of -God's usual dealing. Of careless and obstiDate sinners he says, ' Let themii alone,' till the measure of their iniquities is fulfilled. But He lays His fatherly correction upon those who are so far reformed as to profit by His chastisements. Thus this judgment has coulie upon us wbhen there is a more general spirit of prayer in the nhurch of Christ, and a greater readiness to turn to the hand that smiteth, and more preparednees to bring forth the fruits meet for repentance, than at any earlier period of our con. nexion with India. Here is the ground of hope that the Lord will still niingle mercy with judgment; that He wiU xnake the wrath of inan to praise Himu, and the remainder of wrath will restrain ; so that the things which bave hap. pered may eventually turn out to the furtherance of the gospel. " In this hope the committee venture to urge their friends throughout the counitry to make the approaching Day of National Humiliation one of special remembrance of our past and present sins, in respect of our neglect of the best mnterests of British India; and of resolutions to repent. Notwithstsanding our partial reformation, there is a call for the deepest self-abasemwent before God, and of the humblest confession of sin. The vast tracts of the country lying in unbroken heathenism-the paucity of missionaries, scarcely one for half a million-the gross darkness of the people, reproach our nfglect. The desperate malignity evidenced in this outibreak, the tendency of secular education without Christianity to make aii unconverted man a more dangerous enemy, evidenc(d in the case of Nena Sabib, have punished this neglect. These and many such topics wiU readily occur to every Christian mind. The committeetherefore abstain from the enumeration of them. But they venture to select a few pointa in which they conceive that the Government of India and the church of Christ are specially called upon by the prtsent judgment to show forth tho sincority of their reFentance, if lie in mercy gives us back our Indian empire. " 1. Let it be urged uponI the Government of India to honour God by avowing itself a Christian Government-not neutral or indifferent to the religion of its subjects, but wishing that all shouild have the opportunity of knowing mrd jodging of the oui.us ol revealed truth, and desirous of their becouing CDhristians, upon personal coniviction of the tiuth of Christianity. Letthisavoval heaccompanied'with the widest possible proclanmation thatnocompulsion wiU be used, no bribe will be given. The consistency and honesty of such declarations wouild he easily understood by the natives. Whereas the neutral and equivocal position which the Government of li.dia hlis hitherto attemnpted to maintain liss been unintelligible. Theo imutineers have discredited the sincerity of Goverml,u,ct, and have charged it with secret designs of naking CU'ristians. ?Not a voice has been heard against Christian wmixionaries, niot a complaint against the circulation of the Bible or of Christian tracts. For here the agents have avosved their object. The irritation has sprung fron supposed acts of Government, undor a charge equally falhe and ridiculo,us. ' Theom that honour me I will honour, saith the Lord; and they that despise me shall be lightly esteenmed.' " The avowal for which we plead would facilitate and lrsure the severance of the last links of governmental conut ioni with idolatry. Such links do remain, and must be severed, if we are to plead for mercy before God with clean hands ; if we desire to render again unto the Lord according to His mercies, when He has granted us the deliverance we supplicate. It was a noble act of Lord lfardinge, when Governor-General of India, after our deliverance from the first Sikh war, to issue an ordinance that aU public works should be stopped on the Lord's-day. The spirit of this public recognition of the Christian Sabbath is a precedent for such a declaratiozi as is here advocated. "2. Letthetoleration of aU forms of relig;ionbe guaranteed, so far as concerns a mnan's opiuions and his forms of worship, but not so far as to tolerate anti-social customs or immnnoral practices ninder the garb of religion. Let the moral law of England be the moral law of lndia. " Very much has been effected of late years in conformity with this principle. Suttees and infanticide have been prohibited, slavery has been abolished, civil disqualifications upon conversion to Christianity have been in some measure removed, the remarriage of widowvs has been sanctioned by law. But there remilain other measures of a like kind, -especialy such as are required for the rescue of the female sex from itS present degradation; for the suppression of the public exhibhiton of indecency lit so-called religious rites and for the discouragenment of caste distinctions, as forming a barrier against Christianity. A single specimen will show how Government gives legal sanction to such public indecency. a Act was passed by the Legislative Council of India (No. 1, )S56) to prevent the sale or exposure of obscene books and piutures. The preamble very properly states, that 'the practice of offering for sale or exposing to public view obscene books and pictures encourages imnorality, and it is expedient to make pr,nision for tile preventionof such practice.' Butitenacts that ' nothing contained in the Act shall applyto any representation sculptured, engraved, or painted on or in any temple, or on any car used for the conveyanc of idols. Yet these temples and cars are the most public and freelnented objects of observaticn to the whole population ! The instru:ci.-nt of livine jlidginent has been the cherished high caste Bengal army, from which the first Sepoy Christian convert was expelled tbrough caste prejudices, in the yeas- 1s19, by order of the Governor- General, after an offBcial inquiry at Meerut, in which the soldier was acquitted of every charge -except that of becoming a Christian on conviction. At hleerut the first biood was shed by S Ipoys ' he i wise shail observe tbese things,' anm will mark In this and other peculiarities of the judgnment the reflection of our national sins. " 3. Let Government education comprise the teaching of the Word of God. A systein of grants-in-aid to schools of al denominations having been establisbed, Government has given a general oncouragement to education; yet in Its own schools it excludse the Bible. The pretence that the Bible will offend prej'udices is proved unsound, by the fact that missionary schools educate far larger numbers of heathen and bMahomedean children than Government schools, and heathen Rajahs introduce the Christian Scriptures into 'their schools as an inmportant part of Western literature. Wby, therefore, should a Christian Government put such diah onour upon the Book of God ? Let this remnant of an almost offete compromzise be removed; or let the edueation of Government bo confined to grants-in-aid on a suficiently liberal scale to meet the requirements. 4. Besides these public measures, the present awful caamities call upon tho Christian chbrches to make a new and enlarged effort to send forth missionaries to lndia. If oiven batk to Britihh supremacy, it wll be with a double obigation to evangelize the land. Every consideration of aelf-interest impela us to seek to enlarge the number of thoss batives who will le bound to a3 by the surest of all ties-a -common faith. Every motive of compassion prom ta us to eud forth those vrho may exercise the ministry of mercy, and of reconciliation in a double sense; for. amid tho suffer. inps of our own sountrymen, we cannot forget the just and Ascessary, but very terrible, retribution uapon the mutineers Tnnat bring an awful weight of calamity upon the native opulation generally, and if eamino and pestilenco follow In te train the calamity will he fearfully angmented. " 5. The committee would ventnre further to sugget th%t the present would be an appropriate occsion for a great sPecial effort to give Christian instruction in the verna4lar n gee of India to the mn ea of the population, and to provide them with a vernacular, moral, and Christian literA- iThe question which now trembles on the balance is whether the masses will rise with the mutineer Sepoys or remain faithful, or at least passive. Yet few attempts have been made for the education of these masges. Missionary societies need to be aided by some separato offort for this object. Might not all supporters of Protestant missionary societies uite together to accomplish this special work ? The sea.son is favourable to such a union, as a common calamity has tended to bring all parties together for united prayer. A limited effort uDon this principle to supply vernacular schoolbooks is in operation for South India. Sach a special work would supply an interesting memorial of a season of unprecedented peril to the honour and welfare of England when the calamity shall be, through God's good I'rovidence, overpaxst. The committee venture therefore to throw out the suggestion for further consideration. "The committee must, in conclusion, allude to the |pecuniary los to the society which will be occasioned by t this mutiny. They are not able at present to calcula-e the amount, hut it will probably exceed 20.0001. or .0,0001. A large expenditure must also be incurred by the temporary removal of mlissionaries or their families, vrhile for the prasent the yearly amount of contributions f:om lorthIndia of 8,000t. or 10,0001. cannot be expected. Under these circumstances the society will need the extraordinary aid of friends at home. But they do not at present urge special efforts to raise such aid, because they are desirous of not interfering with the fund now being raised for temporal relief to the many thousand suffering European families, who have been more heavily afflicted than the missionaries, and have many of them lost together with their property aUl their mesns of support. "A A few zealous friends have already sent special donations to the society to meet the emorgenoy, which the com. ntittee most thankfully acknowledge, and such donations will be kept separate for the fund in prospect. But at present the committee desire to promote the fund for temporal relief, of which they are convinced there is the utmost need. II Several of the missionaries of the society belonging to the North Indian Missions, now In England, having expressed their readiness to procoed to their stations at once, and others in Indiia having expressed their determination to remain at their posts, while, on the other hand, it has been suggested that such missionaries might be better employed at home, the following resolutions upon this subject have been adopted. " 1. That this committee recognize the great and anxious importance ofi the question, whether missionaries labouring in the disturbed districtsof India should remain at their posts as long as other Europeains, or European troops, are on the spot, as well as whether missionaries now in Ensland should proceed to such districts ; that adverting to theoase of the native Christians, and the great encouragement which they will derive from the presence of missionaries, as well as their need of increased spiritual support and instruction at such a time as the present; adverting also to the extraordinary and urgent need for additiona spiritual ministrations for our own comntrymen in India; adverting also to the reflections to which the missionary cause woald be exposed at bore, if, while civil and military officers and chaplains are proceeding to India under Government orders, missionaries should bei held back; believing also that missionary work wvll not be long impeded, and that unprecedented opportanities for missionary labour will shortly arise, this commnittee cannot but express itseirnesthope that no missionary will withdraw from India except under medical certifioate that his health requires it; and the missionaries not otherwise prevented from returning to India, or having been appointed to Indian stations, will be prepared to go forth at once in reliance upon the Lord. "1 2. That this committee will afford every facility in their power for the removal and comfort of families separated from the mnissionaries in consequence of the prenat circunistances of India."
DOES OFFICIAL BESPONSIBILITY BXIST? TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It has been announced that General Lloyd is under arrest, and is to be brought to a court-martial for not having displayed proper activity and vigour at Dinapore. General Lloyd is a broken old man of 70! The Psalmist has told us " that the days of our age they are but three score years and ten, and though men be so strong that they do come to four score years, yet is their strength then but labour and sorrow, so soon it passeth away and we are gone." And yet we are about to try a notoriously lnfirm septuagenarian for a lack of activity and vigour ! Sir, If we try General Lloyd we shall try the wrong man. Whose duty was it to see that such commands as that of General Lloyd's were In competent bands-to report upon them if they were not-to act on suich reports? We take ahnost vexatious pains to ascertain that a recruit is sound wind and limb. We strip him naked, we pommel him all over, we make him go through all manner of probationary contortions, and we reject him at once if we espy the slightest defect in his physique, considering him unfit in such case to be intrusted with the responsibility of a private in the British army. But when we have to appoint a General to a position in which the lives of thou3ands, his country's honour, the fate of an empire may depend on his soundness of mind and body we take none of these precautions. If we see that he is an obvious cripple and dotard, we appoint him all the same; "it would be so hard upon the poor old man to pass him over." Yet if he falls when he is so appointed-as we know he must fail when put to the tes4,-we inexorably try the poor old creature by court-m Lartial ! That th ~re have been septuagenarians and octogenarians who have done good service to the State in spite of their years is true; but there have been very few of them. Pahnerstons, Napiers, and Radetzkys are rare fowl ; it will not answer to reckon on a regular supply of them in the market. I As a general rule, it is safest to assume that a man oft 70 is unfit for any public duties, military or civil. Certain passages occur in the evidence given before the Purchase Commissioners by Sir James Simpson which are so apt to General Lloyd's case that I must submit a precis of them to the public. (See qq. 2,877 to 2,895). General Simpson informed the Commissioners I that before the Russian war he was InspectorGeneral of a district in England, and ia that capacity he occasionally came across certain old gentlemen in command of regiments who were perfectly untit for their positions. Se felt it his duty to report them, officially, as superannuated, dull, and useless. No notice was taken of his reports; and the dull, useless old gentlemen thus reported on remained at the head of their regiments just as if they had been able and efficient oflicers. Two cases General Simpson specified, in which one of the incapable Lieutenant-Colonels remained in command of his reginent till he died; tlQi otler is in (0?nmmand of his regiment still, " much to the detriment of the public service," adds General Simpson. The reason that the Commander-in-Chief is thus regardless of the reports of Inspectina Generals is, we are told, twofold. In the first pRace, it is considered at the Horse Guards very hard to deprive a man of his command merely because he is officially reported to be unfit for it; and, in the second place, the officer so exected might possibly take offence at his ejection, and " give trouble." These are the ipsissimla rerba of Sir James Simpson,-an officer of great experience at the Horse Guards and elsewhere. General Lloyd appears to come up to General Simpson's idea of an effete veteran whom it would be hard and might be disagreeable to supersede. Hle is old and infirm, he is probably not very acute, and, to use General Simpson's words, "pretty useless." The Governor-General and the Commander-in. Chief have doubtless been aware of these slight defectsin an officerintrusted with an important post,but they have, with a curious mixture of good nature and selfishness, refrained from superseding him, partly because he might not like being superseded, and partly because, if superseded, he might " take offence and give trouble.' They are now, however, about to make up for their mistaken lenity by trying the poor old man by court-martial for the absence of qualities which they never supposed him to possess, and which his age and infirmities obviously precluded him from possessing. If a railway accident occurred in consequence of the want of energy and vigour of the driver, a man of 70, long known to be ruptured and gouty, and if lives were lost, what would the verdict of the jury be, supposing the directors defended themselves by alleging that it would have been hard upon the poor old driver to supersede him, and that he would probably have been very importunate for a pension had he been superseded ? I am. Sir, our ohdli ,o A CIVILIAN.

TO TEE BDITOR OF THE TIMEBS. Sir,-Will you think me very presumptuous if I ask you to insert the accompanying letter to the ladies of England in your widely-circulated paper, eitber in the evening edition of Tuesday's Times, or the first edition on Wednesday? 1 am encouraged to tbink you may perhaps do so from the knowledge that you have yourself, on at least one occasion, strongly denounced the extravagance of the present fashions. All denunciations on the subject have hitherto proved fruitless, end it may seem presumptuous in me to hope that where others have failed I should succed ; but I trust that the present crisis, and the voice of conscience which must have begun to make itself heard in every female heart, may give to my words a force and point which no mere eloquence can bestow. And when I feel inclined to smile at the absurdity of an unfashionable person in a country village daring to attack one of the most crying abuses of the day, the fable of the " lion and the mouse" rises to my mind, and I think that the mouse's part may perhaps be mine; that I may possibly be the first to break the net of fashion in -which the lion acciety is entangled. Believe me to remain, Sir, - - - --iE-~OR. " Sisters and Countrywomen !-Will you who live in 'the world,' as it is caUed, hear a few words of very plain speaking from one -who lives so far ' oat of it' as to fancy that its fashions ought not to be implicitly followed ; who. being merely a looker-on at the game of fashionable lifo, fancies that she can see and judge of its moves better than the players themselves ? " Wednesday next has been appointed by our Queen as a Day of Humiliation and Prayer in behalf of our feLow-subjects in India, to implore God's blessing upon them and upon our arms. I doubt not that by most, If not by aU of us, its appointment has been hailed with satisfaction, and that it will be devoutly and solemnly observed; that fervent intercessions will ascend to Heaven in behalf of those whom we are powerless otherwise to assist, whose past sufferings and present perils have saddened every heart. This is the first and most obvious use to be made of such a day, but it is no' the only one. Will not many look on it also as calling them to a rigorous examination, not into the blunders of the East India Company, or the mistakes of the Home Government, but into their own conduct, to discover if they are themselves indulging in any propensity which may help to draw down upon the land the chastisements of God? "' Such meditations may just now be especially profitable, since within the last few years one propensity which has always been looked upon and laughed at as a female weakness-I mean the inordinate love of dress-has risen to sauh a height, and has spread so widely through all classes, that it cen no longer be caUed a weakness-it is a siu. Is this expression too strong, when ball dresses for 1004 each are publicly advertised for sale, wvhen ladies have been known to talk of limiting their personal expenditure to 1,0004 per annum, when large fortunes are impaired and small ones wasted in the endeavour to keep pace with the daily increasing extravagance of fashion? Those vwho are very rich will perhaps say, ' We can afford a large expenditure in such matters without exceeding our income or neglecting other claims, and those who follow our example without possessing our means must do so at their peril.' But let me ask such to reflect for one moment whether it can possibly be right to expend on mere personal decoration sums of money which if differently applied might save so many fellow-creatures from misery and vice? That money well employed is thus powerful no one who reads the newspapers can doubt. Tiw Tines of a very few days ago contained a letter from Major Powys, secretary to the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, at Hampstead, stating that asylum to be already so full that without fresh and liberal contributions it would not be able to admit any of the orphan children of those brave soldiers who have lately faLen in India. Can there be at the present crisis a stronger eaull for our charity than this? And this is one oat of many similar calls. Every charitable institution throughout this land, whether it be the Asylum for the Blind, that for the Deaf and Dumb, the Asylam for Idiots, the Infant Orphan Asylum, a Sailorse Home, or a Consumption Hospital, one and all call loudly in each of their reports for more means to meet the continually increasing applicatioas for help. Many will say, 'I belong already to some or all of these ;' but, if so, they must know full well that for every candidate elected to one of these institutions there are 10 or more disappointed; there, are 10 or more blind, or helpless, or idiot children, asking vainly for help and for relief. Surely they who know this cannot think that by sabscribing, out of an ample income, one guinea yearly to five or to 20 of such charities, they have done enough for their suffering fellow-creatures. They will, perhaps, reply, ' I do not limit my alms-giving to a few subsoriptions such as these; when in the country, I always en. deavour to become acquainted with my poorer neighbours, and gladly afford them moderate and necessary help.' I am thankful to believe that many, if not most, of my countrywomen may say this with perfect truth. That personal acquaintance with the poor which is one of the greatest benefits reaped by a residence in the country makes alms-giving easy and pleasant; it is natural to every kind. hearted lady to relieve the want which she actually sees; and in the country, generally bpeaking, the want is of so much milder a form than prevails in large towns, that a little money judiciously bestowed goes (as it is commonly said) a long way. But it is far otherwise in London and the manufacturing towns; there poverty exists in such masses and takes such frightful forms that the united efforts of numbers can alone struggle with it successf uoUy. We have al read of those swarming districts where families of human beings are crowded like so many animals into the smallest possible spaoe, to the destruction at once of health and of decency; where the inhabitants, though living within the sound of church bells, never dream of entering a ohurch, being heathens in all bat name,-nay, more miserable than the heathen, for they know enough of their God to take his holy name in vain. We have, heard how such parents do not only neglect their children, bat too often deliberately instract them in aU kinds of wickedness-a lore only too quickly learnt and too faithfully retained by their unhappy offspring. I will not do more than alUade to these things; we aU know them, and cannot think of them without a shuddez, but are we therefore justified In shutting our eyes to them? Sarely not, unless it were proved that such a state of things were past remedy; and those noble-hearted individuals of either sex who are striving with aU their strength to stem this tide of misery continually assure us that it is not so,-that much has been done already, but that doubled means would produce more than doubled good. Ragged schools, reformatories, penitentiari, s, all tell the same tale,-' Much is doing; give us more labourers and more money that we may do yet more.' Few have the power, fewer still the inclination, to devote their lives to such a service; but those who have wealth and influence (and it is to these I would chiefly address myself) may aid in these noble labours most effectually if they will open their purses generously. If our time and our energies are too preocious to be sacrificed for the good of our neighbour, let us at least sacrifice largely of our gold. " Our foreign missionaries, too, aU agree in saying that the want of 'more labourers and more money' is what mainly impedes the progress of Christianity in our colonies. With the exception, perhaps, of the Hindoo race, the heathens generally show themselves anxious for instraction. The late events in India showv what heathenism is when it has thrown off the restraints of authority. ShaU we not each do all we can to plant among the heathen that religion to wbich we owe aU that is good in ourselves? "These are some of the ways in whioh those persons whose 'gold hangs heavy on their hands' may sperd it with advantage to themselves as wel as to their neighbours "-But perhaps some of the richest of my sisters will here exclaim, ' No one cxn afford to give liberaUy to all these things; they would soon cease to be rich if they did so.' Undoubtedly they cannot at once give largely in charity and spend largely on themselves. No one can give freely towards the building of a new churoh, of a hospital, or a reformatory (however grievously either may be wanted), who thinka it necessary to wear dresses of 'rich moire antique' ranging in value from 101. to 201; who reouires ' pearl trimmings' for an evening dress, and 'gold brocade' for a Court train; who would sigh for a ' flounoe of Venice point' at 841., or a ' point-lace parasor at 181. That thore are fashionable ladies who thus squauder their riches a recent trial has informed us, No doubt there are msany more who would oondemn and avoid such utterly rmukles3 expenditure; but if they themselves habitualy spend on their dress twice the sum they thought necessary only five years ago, they are lending their countenance to the very excesses they condemn. "In matters such as these, whatever may be the general standard, there wiUl always be many persons who seek distinction by exceeding it,-whose aim and delight is to ' outHerod Herod ;' but there Is a far larger number, who, either from want of thought or want of courage, seek only to follow as closely as possible the example of those immediately above them. Shall this example always be a dangerous one? Will not some of those Individuals whose conspicuous position, or whose strongor charaoter, naturally marks them out as leaders in society set themselvea Eeriously to correct the evils their put extravaganoe may have caused, by setting an example of moderation and self- denial from this day forward? There is reason to hope thab such an example would soon be widely followed. We may surely assume that one large and infuteutial body-I mean the 'wives oftthe clergy throughout the country-will gladlr welcome and forward such a movement; and there ar3 besides hundreds of ladies vwho would rejoice to see the tids of extravagance turned, though they have wanted conrage to attempt to stem it. " Can there be a fitter time than the present for attempt. ing such a reform? If laxury and extravagance were ever justifiable, they would still be grievously out of place at a time of heavy national disaster and unexampled private calamity. " Shall not, then, the Day of Humiliation see the commencement of a reform in these things? Let s not be satisfied v.ith laying aside, on that one day, our gay and costly apparel, to resume it thoughtlessly on the morrow; but let us lay aside, also, never to he resumed, the selfish vanity, the unchristian pride, and the deliberate self-indul gence from which onr sinful extravagance has sprung. Let us each mend ourselves, that all may be mended; and since our sex must ever preclude us from actively serving our beloved country, let us be doubly careful that no sins or negligences of ours help to bring down on her the judgments of Heaven, "'That if our country stand not by our skill, " 'At least our foilies may not work her fall.' "And now I vdll take my leave of my dear country. women, first thanking them for the patient hering they have given to their unknown but affectionate sister, " ELEANOR."
ABCHBISHoP CULLEN'S PASTORAL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIES. Sir,-I have just read with much surprise and regret the contents of a letter in your journal of this morning written by Archbishop Cullen, dated from Rome, and addressed to one of his vicars-general, with the object, as it seems, of inducing Roman Catholics to withhold their aid from the Relief Fund for the Sufferers in India. If he really believes that there is danger that the fund may be applied " by bigots in proselytizing purposes" his better course would be to raise by the subscriptions of Roman Catholics a separate fund for the relief of the sufferers of their own persuasion, in that respect following apparently the example of a higher authority in the Roman Catholic Charch. But could anything be more unwise ? Is this a moment to add a drop to the cup of bitterness between the two churches ? The heart of every man beats warmly in favour of our Suffering and brave soldiers and fellow-subjects in India v,ithout reference to creed. I cannot believe that any sub. scriber has considered whether his donation will relieve a Protestantor a Roman Catholic. The Sultan of Tur'keyhas set us an example in his munHicent subscription whichrmay make us Christians ashamed of insisting upon differences between our churches as a ground for not subscribing to the general fund. Roman Catholic equaUy with Protestant blood has been freely shed with a noble daring in defence of our sovereignty in the East. Christians of all denomi. nations have suffered torture and death in their most savage forms, and the object of the subscribers is to alleviate the sufferings of those who survive. It is treason to humanity to suppose that the ftnd will not be honestly dedicated to the sacred purposes for which it is designed. Still, I should not have felt it my duty to make any remark on Dr. Cullen's letter had he abstained from attacking the management of the Patriotic Fund as regards the widows and orphans of Roman Catholie soldiers duriag the period I had the honour of being chairman of the executive and finance committee. According to his statement applications were made by Catholic clergy. men of Dablin to the managers of the fund In favour of the widows and orphans of soldiers kiled in the Crimea, yet, as far as he could learn, not one shilling was then ob. tained by such applications. Now, I assert that no appiL cation for the relief of any widow or orphan of a soldier killed in the Crimea was ever rejected or neglected, although I think it probable that applications by Roman Catholic clergymen of Dublin for money to be remitted to them for distribution by them among claimants of their own creed were not complied with. But I say, without fear of contradiction, that in distributing relief no question ever arose as to the religious persuasion of the claimant, except so far as to make the mode of payment as agreeable as it might be to the recipient. Archbishop Cnlleu then states that when relief was granted in Dublin a parson was always employed to administer it, and he had heard that he generally selected a Protestant church or vestry as the place of doling it out. I never heard, during the many months of my attendance on the duties of my office as chairman of the committee, any complaint of the manner of the distribution, and the payments were made by the paymasters of pensions wherever their services could be obtained, and always so asS to meet the convenience of the claimants as far as might be. Doctor Cullen then refers to the manner in which the funds were altimatelv aUotted, and he says that they seem to be all grants to Protestant institutions and for Protestant purposes. This only proves that Dr. Callen is writing from Rome upon a subject dear to Englaud and Ireland in regard to which he is ill-informed. At every step care has been takern to extend the same reief to the widows and children of Roman Catholics as to those of Protestants. But while religious belief forms no element in the claim to relief, due regard has been paid to the religious feelings and education of the Roman Catholics. Some attempt was made to obtain a separate alotment out of the fund, to be managed by a committee of Roman Catholic gentlemen, for the relief of Roman Catholic objects in Ireland, but this was resisted, and I certainly understood that the arrangements as they now stand satisfied al classes and every denomination of Christians. If the charge of unfair conduct in regard to 2elief from the Patriotic Fund should be persisted in, it may be found necessary to enter more particularly into facts in order to vindicate the conduct of the committee, which, up to this moment, has never been impeached. I have the honour to hAb Rir ---r 1 ... ST. LEONAR'S. Boyle Farm, Oct. 5.
THE LATE MR. JERROLD. TO TEIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You were so kind as to give pablicity to a letter we addressed to you on the termination of our labounrs " In remembrance of the late Mr. Jerrold," making known their result. Mr. Jerrold's eldest son thereupon gave to a letter of his own what publicity he oould obtain for it, making his own reprasentation of his late father's affairs. We knew our forbearing and delicate reference to them (forced upon u3 by exaggerations with which we had been repeatedly met, and which the son had never contradicted) to be perfectly accurate, and we knew his account of them to be highly incorrect. We are extremely sorry to ba obliged to produce the proof of this; but it is necessary to the clearance of our own good faith. and that of the gentlemen associated with us. We have before us, under date tho 2d of this present mc nth, a letter from the solicitor to the late Mr. Jcrrold's estate (a gentleman well known In his profession, Mr. Ashurst, of the Old Jewry), in which, aft,!- mentioning that there is a life assurance of 1,0001., which is Mrs. Jerrold's absolntely, and which the estate cannot claim, he informs the correspondent to whom his communication is addressed " that he cannot understand MEr. Blanchard Jerrold's reason for writing this unfortunate letter;" that he thinks " he and his famnily ought to be set right on the matter;" and that, if a certain claim be urged of which he has received the particulars, " the facts and figures show that the estate will be absolutely insolvent." We quote this letter with its writer's permission, and we have now done with this subject for ever. Youlr faithfnl nc CHARlES DKcRENS. ARTHUR SMITH. October 6, 1357.
PORBIGf BUFFI.ANa TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Rather more than three wecks ago one of my younger soBs, about 10 years of age, was passing through London, on his way to school, under the care of an elder brother, a :ixth form boy at Harrow. The day wa extremely wet, and the little boy was carrying an umbrella to shelter himself from heavy rain which was faUing. As he was p%=ing up Regent-street, near the Circus, about 2 p.m., he accidentally pushed against, or in some way incommoded with bis umbrella, one of the numerous foreigners who swagger aboutthat vicinity, with red caps on their heads and sticks in their hands. The ruffian immediately turned rourd and followed the child, and struck him from behind a violent blow on the head with the knot or handle of his stick. His brother, who was just in front, turned round on hearing the child cry, and havine learnt what had occurred foUowedtbe assailant, and, fortunately meeting a policeman almost immediately, gave the man in charge. The policeman gave every attention to the complaint, but said that as on examining the child's head he did not find any jblood, he had no authority to take the assailant into custody. As a considerable crowd had collected, and the boys were only pacsing through London, and could not stop without very great inconvernience, the elder brother thought it better to let the mattcr drop there; and I do not kmow that he could have well done otherwise. i The only remedy for such brutality appears to be publicity in your columns, which may put aU who have the charge of children in London on their guard against the violence of these lawless men, for the assailant was walking with a companion of his own class. The violence of the blow is evinced by the fact that the child is still suffering from it, and the medical man who has been called in says that it may be some time before he recovers from it. The cowardly and un-English nature of the act will be beat appreciated when it is recollected that the man name upon the child from behind and strtck him, 'witbout speaking, upon his head, whieh was protected only by a light capy and was covered by the umbrella, so that he could not Bee the approach of his assailant; and, moreover, that the elder brother being just in front, not beside the cbild, he might suppose that the little boy was altogether un,rot_td,3 _ A MA GISTRATE FOR THE COLTNTY OF KRENT. uectber 6.
SOUTH A USTRALIAN EXPLOBATION. The following extract from a report dated the 8th of July, from the Assistant-Surveyor-General of South Australia, of a recent expedition into the northern districts of that colony, has been forwarded to us for publication:- " In the extreme distance to the north and north-esst we perceived a belt of gigantic gums, beyond which appeared a sneet of water with lands on the opposite side, evidently increasing in elevation. There also seemed to be a large lake about ton miles to the east, but this our previous experience told us had no existence. To the north-east the M'Donnell continued its course, diverging into a number of channels as the rocks neared the surface, and again converging into one as the depth of soil increased. To the south-east the extreme end of the eastern range was stiU vWisible, Mount Hopeful bearing south 32 degrees east, and apparently aboxt 30 miles distant. From Weathered-bill we descended In a north-easterl, direction to the MDonnell, folowing its course down for about seven miles, passing several large and permanent waters, the last of which, about half a-mile long, 50 yard8 wide, and very deep, was extremely fine, having a native encampment on the eastern hank at its lower end. The Wurleys did not appear to have been used since the rain, however, the floors being caked over and cracked by the heat of the sun. They are constructed in a similar manner to those described by Captain Sturt, and are warm and comfortable, the largest capable of holding from 30 to 40 people, quite round, from three to four feet high, and entered by a semicircular opening, through which we were obliged to creep. This water we named the Werta-Warta, from the name of the tribe frequenting the plains north of the Blanche. " Next day we continued our course to the north-east down the bed of the creek for about 14 miles, passing over vegetation of the most luxurlant kind, which covers the valley for a width of from three to four miles, the timbor in the creeks changing from lofty gums to a bastard peppermint, vhich was rapidly assuming a more stunted appear. ance, and the creeks bending away to the eastward. We then left the M'Donnell and made for the nearest point of what was rapidly assuming the appewrance of an immense lake, and after traveUing about six miles and a-half to the north-east our doubts were set at rest. We were in latitu de 290 13, and stood upon the margin of Lake Torrens, the waters of which were unmistakably fresh. " From the spot where my observationswero taken the lake stretched from 15 to 20 miles to the north-west, forming a water horizon extending from north-west by west to northwest; the south portion terminated by high land running south towards Weathered-hill, at once explaining the cause of the various creeks bending so much to the eastward. An extensive bay is formed inside this promontory, extending southward to west-north-west, when the land again runs out to a point, approaching and passing us by a gontle curve to the east, and inclining gradually to the.south-east, and ultimately disappearing in the distance. The north portion of the horizon is terminated by a blau headland, round which the water appears to extend to the north. This land passe thence to the east, and forms the north boundary of the visible portion of the lake; and from a higher elevation than that upon which we stood appeared to extend round to the eastern wing. It is covered with vegetation, as also are several islands seen between the north and south shores, apparently about five miles distant from where we stood, their perpendicular cliffs being clearly discerned by aid ol the telescope. " From the first I had anticipated finding large lakes of fresh water at the termination of the various creeks, or one large lake into which a number of them discharged their waters; but in such I should have discovered flood lines, indicating the rise and fall of the waters, and, even supposing them to have attained their maximum height, the vegetation on somae portion of the surface inside the water'8 edge would have revealed this fact. But in this case there was an entire absence of such marks, the water's edge being clearly defined; and the bed, changing its character so suddenly from an alluvial soil to blue loam, covered by an Inch of fine silt, renders it almost beyond the possibility of a doubt that the surface of the water is subject only to the most trifling variation of level, and the absence of delts at the embouchures of the creeks tends to show that there is no reacting force, but that the waters in times of flood flow uninterruptedly elsewhere, and I am inclined to believe in a generally north-west directioD. "In using the words ' unmistakably fresh,' vith reference to this water, I meant to imply that, not only did they appear fresh to the taste, but that also- there was no indication whatever of the presence of salt; and I only regretted the absence of the means which wound have enabled me to test, not only their extent and direction, but also their depths and action."
THE BISHOP OF ZHORWICH OX TJHE PRESENT GRISIB. At the annual meeting of the Church Missionary Society, held in the Corn Exchange, Ipswich, on Monday, the attendance of the Bishop of the diocess-hig first visit to the tovn since his elevation to ths bishopric of Norwich-having been announced, there was a large and highly influentil3 meet. the course of his speech his LORDSHIP said,-There is so much at this moment to teach every reflective mind in this country these two important truths. The first is this, that while we are blessed by God perhaps beyond any other nation now, or that ever existed in times past,-that while both in temporal things and spiritual things God has dealt out very largely His benefits upon us, yet that, as we look abroad, we are evidently taught to feel that all our mercies are held in the hand of a God of Judgment, and that while He is scattering vast blessings upon us, and. opening to us those hononrable opportunities for serving Him on this earth, He is looking upon us as to the manner and way in which we discharge our great stewardship to Him in all that He has entrusted us with. Our mercies are held in the hands of a God of Judgment. fe can as easily withhold them as He can bestow them. At a word they can be taken away, even as by a long course of providential dealing they have been so wonderfully and so largely bestowed upon us. lWhile all the events which are now taking place in India so painfully and so strongly present to our minds the truth that all our mercies are held in the hande of a God of Judgment, so, as we look out upon the missionary field at large, or as we look upon the state of our own country at home, and see the abundant evidence of God's gracious goodness to us, in our enjoyment at home and In our usefulness, through Him, abroad, we are equaUy convinced of another great blessed truth, that the rod which cbastises us, and the judgment which is to correct, is held in the hand of a God of Mercy. I think these two principles should be looked at in their combination, so that our mind is in the right attitude to deal with the great mercies which God has bestowed upon us on the one hand, and to learn the terrible judgments which we are now receiving at His hands upon the other ; and when we look at both by the aspect of these two great truths, that all our blessings are held in the hand of a God of Judgment, and that the judgment under which our nation is now bowing is dispensed by the God of aU our mercles, one should lead us to rejoice in all our blessings with trembling, and the other should lead us, not only to submission, but to humble ourselves under His mighty hand, and to do it with a feeling of confidence that if we put our cause into His hands and put the provocation of judgment away from our habits and lives, He will indeed raise us up again and will not cast us out by His hand, bhot employ us for His glory and bless us as a nation and people. I was exceedingly struck with the thought so beautifully expressed by an aged, venerable servant of God, who for a long timewas an honoured minister of our chuTch in this land, and who has now for so many years so ably, so faithfully discharged the high office to which he bas been called as Bishoo in India, when in a letter he lately sent home to this country, written from the midst of aU the terrible tidings which were reaching his ears, upon the right hand and upon the left, of the events which were taking place in India, his soul fastened itself upon this one great thought which he expressed in his communlcation," The Lord is on His Throne in Heaven raling all; and Christ, our Christ, is at lis right hand, pleading for us." This is the great object to which the Church of God in England and the Church of God in India should have her faith directed; and looking there she will learn wisdom for her present conduct, take in strength ror her present duty. and find deliverance out of her present difficulties. I will not occupy this meeting by any furtber prefatory remarks to the reports which will be read and the observations which wiiU follow; and I wil now call upon the rev. secretary to read to you the report of your association during the past year, (Applause.)

THE ARCGBISHOP OF CANTERBURY ON CEURCH MfATTERS. CAlTEBDURY, MoNsDAi, This morning the Archbishop of Canterbury met a large body of the clergy at the cathedral, when his Grace delivered a lengthened address on questions relating to the present condition of the ohurch. Referring to the Divorce Bill which passed through Parliament towards the close of the last session, he remarked that it would be of little use to open afresh the questioa of marriage and divorce, which had recently been the subject of anxious Parliamentary legislation. There were portions of the measure which had become law in which he could never concur, and he rejoiced that so many of the clergy had agreed in protesting agains the liberty granted to divorced persons to claim again the rites of the marriage office. He believed, however, that persons under such circumstances would not be anrious to present themselves at church, particularly as there had been provided for them a legal resource of which they could without dif'iculty avail themselves. Adverting to the church-rate question his Grace remarked that it was in statn quo, a circumstance not much to be regretted, as it had given time for an inquiry which could not fail to be highly beneficial, since it had tended to show in how small a proportion of parishes-only five in 100-there was any opposition to church-rates. It would therefore be no less unjust than unreasonable to abolish the impost upon the request of so small a number of persons. He, however, advised that in all cases where it was imposed the object of the rate should be plainly stated, and that nothing should be charged upon it but things which were absolutely required for the services of the church and the sustentation of the fabric. In large parishes, hovwever, there were instances in which portions had been separated and formed into independent ecclesiastical districts, having their own district churches. As they derived no special advantages, they ought to be exempt from all, except, perhaps, a very small portion of the rate, to which the mother church should be entitled, as a tribute towards the religion of the country, vith which property had been charged from time immemorial. The subject, he had no doubt, would undergo further consideration, and he hoped it would be settled with advantage to all classes of the community. He congratulated his rev. brethren upon the fact that there had been none, or hardlv any of those distressing perversions-ho might call them apostacies from the truth-to which at previous me, t;ngs he had thought it necessary to advert, although tL-:c were still portions of the Lora's vineyard where tendencies wero observable towards doctrines ant practices which belonged rather to the church from which they had separated than to that to which they belonged. It was a subject greatly to be regretted, but he trusted that the grounds of complaint would gradually decrease. He regretted to say that of late some disparagement was cast upon the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures. Questions had been raised in influential quarters concerning the Divine inspiration of that authority which for so many years had been unquestioned. If the clear statements of the New Testament were made amenable to man's judgment-if their authors could havo erred or been misled-where would be the foundation of any of our Christian rights? The subject was too important to be discussed in a desultory manner, but it appeared to him that to doubt the inspiration of Scripture, or to suppose that it contained anything not in recordance with the mind of God, was to attribonte to the Almighty a want of foresight which, not to speak irreverently, could not even be expected in fallible man. It was as if the inventor of one of those wonderful and complicated machines which the science of these latter days had conirived w,ere to deposit it in some distant land, or so to adjust it thatpersons might tamper with it to their own destruction. The gigantic plan of the Most High for the salvaton of men, laid down from the foundation of the world, at first obscurely hinted at, was utade more plain to Abrahamn, and still plainer to Moses, and the light stiil kept on increasing through the long line of prophets until the expectations of devout persona were so ripened that they ware looking for the redemption of Israel at the very time that our Lord was made manifest in the flesh and proved his Godhead by a display of Almighty power and bv a life of suflering. To doubt the Divine wisdom in the matter of revelation was to believe that God so loved the world as to give his only-begotten Son to die for our sins, and yet to make no effectual provision to acquaint mankind with the object for which his Son vas sont, or the mode in vwhich what He did was available for the salvation of sinners. To his mind, it would be less difficult to reject the Scripture altogether than to doubt the inspiration of any part of it. His Grace, having next spoken of the increase of churehes and schools in his diocess, adverted to the e-xtension of the episcopate. Since 1840 19 new sees had been founded, and this he held to be among the subjects vwhich the church had for congratulation. On the other hand, they had to deplore the spread of Ilomish principles and of latitudinarian speculation, together with the indifference and demoralization of the working classes and the desecration of the Lord's-day consequent on the introduction of railways. The Arotbishop conclnded with some practical advice tothe clergr on the manner in which their parochial ministrations should be conducted.

LONfDON, WEDNB.SDAY, OCTOBBR 7, 1857. The lwhole country meets on this day to deplore in the presence of GOD the national visitation involved in the Indian Mutiuy. It is a day of Naticnal Humiliation, and its suitable accompaniment, national self-examination. We have 1had India now a hulndred years, and what is the result ? Is it good, bad, or indifferent? The iuation is on this day supposed solemnly to review its Indian policy, to ask itself what good it has dcne, and wlhat proportion such good bears to the meaus it has had at its command. There can be no doubt that the object for -which we ought to consider ourselves to hold India is the foture Christianity aud civilization of the people. It will be said this is aiming high, and so it is, but until it is proved that tbis result is impossible we must aim at it; as a Christian nation we have no other alternative. Some say this is impossible. There are philosophical theories to this effect, theories about races and what they are susceptible of. And even before the theory about races sprang -up the institutions of Hlindostan were thought by mnany to oppose an irresistible obstacle to Christianity. SIDNEY SMITH adopted this ground in an essay 50 years ago. India has, in fact, acted like a NEDusA's head upon many persons, and some of those the most intelligent thinkers. It has turned them into stone. The sight of the stern features ,Df that rigid system, with the minds of the nativei locked in its iron grasp, has chilled their lifeblood and deadened hope. What can we do against such institutions acting upon such a race ? The aippeal to the imagination is indeed fearfully strong. Still, even apart from the plain promise of revelation, reason itself tells us that it is quite impossible that we can proncunce against the capacity of the Hindoos for civilization and Christianity. As a matter of fact individuals among them do become sincere Christians. And when we talk about the capacity of a race as such we talk of what we know nothing about. Who can posibly tell what there is or is not in a race, and what may be made of it? It is a hidden vein which facts only can ultimately disclose. And in the meantime we are bound to act with a view to the very highest result, which may, for anything we know to the contrary, be ultimately attained. But how are we to aim at the conversion of the Hindoos to Christianity ? Here is a puzzle indeed. The Gospel and the enlightened mnorality of modern times alike forbid us to use force, and the sun must roll back to the East again before we can recall to life the old theory of persecution, which effected such wonders of conversion in the middle ages. Cn Aenat,n and his Saxons are gone for ever. We are deprived of that mighty engine of conversion, and what have we in its steadc? We have the appeal to the ordinary evidences of Christianity, and to the great fact of modern Europe, which is a result of Christianity, and which an intelligent Hindoo must appreciate. He must see that Christianity is, as a matter of fact, the great civilizing and renovating principle in the world, that all the greatness and power we see in the world are connected with it, and that whatever that vigorous and strong element may be which makes great nations and auccessful ages, and which produces growth and progress among mankind, it is never found except in combination with Christianity. This is a remarkable fact which speaks for itself, and which must make a very powerful impression upon Hindoo intelligence. It must do so by the inevitable laws of reason, and the more it is dwelt npon the more must it impress. There is besides this a higher appeal to the rational religious principle in the human mind as distinguished from the blind and animal faith on which Hindoo idolatry depends. It is impossible that the view which Christianity presents of human life, its purpose, and its results, should not strike any mind in which the light of nature is not wholly suppressed by false tradition as more probable and more reasonable than such a wretched meaningless distortion and chaotio dream as that which composes the prospects and destinies of the Hindoo believer. Hoow can a monstrous system of endless tranemigrations, or eternal nothingness, compare in poinat of naturalness and beauty with the isimple creed of the Christian, of a life of trial here, and endless bliss beyond the grave? Can the two creeds be compared for a moment, in point of interest and consolatory power, in point of harmony and congeniality withour natural feelingis ? This reasonable religion, then, must, according to the principles so well laid down by the great author of the Analogy, have a natural tendency to supersede the wild and distorted schemes of Orientalism,-schemes which have no real root or basis in our nature, but which depend wholly on the external pressure of a system of observances. The true inward light of nataral faith must have a tendency to supplant the darkness of mere credulity, believing in what it is told simply because it is told it, and swallowing any monster of a fiction which the human brain can conceive. These are our means, then, of conversion for India, but we need not say that hitherto they have failed to produce any effect worth mentioning. Nor do we think that this in itself need be any ground for self-humiliation, or be among the facts for which we are to reproach ourselves to-day. Some excellent people think it in itVf a ground for the deepest humiliation that we ba not already converted a large part of India. We do not agree with them here. We do not at all know what was possible to be done in this way. We are not responsible for results, but we are responsible for any actually bad part of our policy and administration. It must be allowed, we thiink, that for a long time we took undue advantage of the necessity we were under of leaving the Eindoos unrestricted in their religion positively to encourage and flatter them in it. Those were mercantile days, in which the only idea of India was that of a source ec revenue. The nation was stupidly afraid of interfering even with the most inhuman customs, with the Suttee system, with the Juggernaut self-immolations. Nothing was to be touched, for fear lest the whole native population should rise up against us on the suspicion that we were going to overthrow their religion. This was a gross abuse of the principle of toleration, of which we are now reaping the fruit in the fastidious touchiness with which the Sepoys resent the slightest and most unintentional interference with a minute detail of ritual. We flattered them so long that now the least thing is felt as a grievance. That was one great abuse. Another wasr the state of English society in India for a long period. It is quite true we have improved on both these heads, but the effect of a long period of cowardly policy and social license is not easily removed. We may hope, however, now, in spite of the cloud at present over our heads, for better things. Our line is clear with respect to India, and made more clear by experience. We must not force our religion upon them, but we must at any rate show them that we think our religion true and theirs false. This is the very first step in the conversion of a people, and yet up to a comparatively recent period this was hardly done; indeed, it seemed as if we aimed at producing the very contrary impression upon the Hindoo mind, as if we wanted the popular impres3ion to be that we were indifferent on the subject. When this first step in the conversion of a people has been taken we may begin to thinkl7that we are doing something, though it maay still be long enough before any results follow. The future of India is hidden from us, and a veil is before our eyes. All we know is that great causes, and causes which have a bearing upon religion, are now in operation in the East. It is a new experiment altogether in history, the propagation of European ideas in an Oriental population, and we cannot possibly tell wlhat time may be required for the working of such an experiment. The experiment has hitherto, indeed, sadly failed, but we cannot judge at aU of its ultimate success from the working of one century. A century is a long time to those who live in it or near it, but it is not a long tinie in the history of the world. If English rule-with all the influences, religious, social, and intellectual, accompanying it-goes on in India and is not stopped, nobody can possibly tell what the effects of such a Government and such influences will be. It seems to stand to reason that it cannot go, indefinitely on ior all time and produce no effects, and if time is in our favour here we have a strong ally, for futilre history, like past geology, is rich in time. There are many past periods in the world's history in which a ce ntury does not figure aa a very active or producai- 'gent. A century did not do very muc . the Nineveh period, or the period of the Shopherd Kings of Egypt. A century did not do much between the reigns of Saxon EGBBRT and Saxon ATrsTA, or between Saxon ATHmsTAN and HAmRDcuTrp ; a century did not do much even between iing Joey and EDWAPRD II., or between EDWARD II. and RICIcARD III. A century did not do very much in Europe for the six centuries preceding the Rleformation. There were seeds sown throughout those times which afterwards bore fruit, but no great actual progress was made from one century to another, and the world was muec the sme at the end of a century as it had been at its beginning. It will be said that a century does a good deal when the world has once begun to advance, but the Eastern world has not begun its march, and we are concerned now with the East. A century, then, is no test of India!s susceptibility of change. The seeds of the Reformation were sown during many stationary centuries, and came up in an active and eventful one at last. It is contrary to true philosophy to despair about India. An unknown future is before us, which, under GOD'S providence, may mature and develope the seeds o truth indefinitely, and produce movements o; thought in that part of the world of which we have now no conception.
Everybody maust feel that we have reason enough this day for humiliation and sorrow. Our countrymen have been massacred by their own soldiers and dependents, our Eastern Empire has been swept by the ravages of a military insurrection, and, besides these incidents of unnatural aggravation, we are confronted with aU the ordinary perils and anxieties of a distant war. But if there is ground for affliction there is also ground for assurance, and the letters received by the last mail, many of which have now appeared in our columns, are well calculated both to encourage our efforts and mitigate our alarms. What a weelk may bring forth under circumstances like the present it is of course impomible to predict, but at all the chief points of interest and danger the position of affairs has been represented as improving. The apprehensions entertained for the safety of Lucknow were naturally great, for the little garrison had lost two commanders in succession, was straitened for provisions, and was begirt on all sides by countless bands of rebels. It was plain, however, from the very history of the siege that the defenders of the place could hold their own against any attacks from without as long as their stores sufficed for their support, and it is stated, not only that the garrison was sill safe on the 14th of August, but that advantage had been taken of General HAYE ocK's march to procure a fresh supply of provisions. The blockade of the place, it was said, had been partially raised, in order that the forces of the insurgents might be concentrated to encounter and oppose General HAvELocx's advance from Cawnpore. This destgn was successfully accompliahed, but only at ths cost of the very object for which it was undertaken. Lucknow was not relieved by the British column, but it was enabled to relieve itself. A sortie was made from the Residency, supplies were collected and carried in, and the garrison thus insured for some time longer against the asaults of their most formidable enemyfamine. These reports will appear the more important when the dates are taken into consideration. If Lucknow was really sae and tolerably well supplied in the middle of August the worst dangers of the garrison would probably be past, for at that time General HAvazocx was halting at Cawnpore, only 53 miles off, and the reinforcenments for which he was waiting were on their way to him; indeed, a commuDication which we published yesterday represented one detachment of the force as having actually arrived on the 17th of Auguist at Allahabad, a town distant only 129 miles from Cawnpore. From Agra the intelligence, under the same dates, is still more satisfactory, and admits of no doubt, as it comes directly from the place itself. There the Europeans had little to dread beyond the tedium and depression created by long confinement, and even in this respect their position had been so far improved as to permit of some little excursion during the daytime. The enemy had drawn off-in fact, the battle which was fought by the garrison at Futteypore Sikri had produced the best results of a victory by securing the fort from attack or investment. The cantonnents had been demolished by the rebels, the dweuinghouses of the Europeans burnt to the ground or dismantled, and much valuable property destroyed; but the garrison was secure, nor was there indeed "anything to complain of on the score of "health," notwithstanding the numbers unavoidably crowded within the precincts of the fort. It is a remarkable circumstance, as showing how rapidly and extensively imprebsions are circulated in India, that the writer of the letter from which we have taken these details anticipates the immediate pacification of the placeftom the mere announcement of General HAvxLocu's advance. "The very idea," says the letter, " of his being on "the road with his troops will quiet down the "district, and make any part of Agra safe to "live in." We may infer from the despatch of troops to Allahabad that the disturbances in the territories between that town and Calcutta, which it was feared would absorb the forces at the disposal of the Government, have been substantially suppressed. We are told, indeed, in a letter from Calcutta, dated August 23, that telegraphic communication had been re-established with Benares, and that the post was open all the way to Cawnpore. Another letter also, from a civilian, which we published yesterday morning, described in some detail the general restoration of order in the Eeveral districts of Behar, so that little alarrm, we trust, need now be felt for the security of the Lower Provinces. At Delhi it is distinctly stated that our prospects have been steadily brightening, and, as we have never ceased to hold our own, or mailntain the aseendancy in actual combat, every improvement in our position must turn :mmediately to the damage of the rebels. The accounts from Calcutta represent them as actually desirous of capitulating, and, though we do not observe any mention of the fact in a letter of August 13 from the place itself, it may be remarked that the Agra letter also describes the revolters as "getting " dispirited." To this conclusion, in fact, we should be naturally led by the known course of events, for it is not in reason to suppose that a body of men who are fighting with halters round their necks, and who for weeks together have bsen unsuccessfully expending their power upon an adversary growing gradually stronger under their eyes, should be otherwise than disheartened at the prospect before them. Of the Bombay Presidency this much, at aa, rate, may be said with saidty-that the progress of the contagion in those provinces does not appear such as would, at its present rate, either overt.ssk the corrective powrers of the authorities or endanger the position of our countrymen before st;cco%.rs arne When onceo the troops on their vo- rorm hm country reach the shores of India o r ay be at an end, and it certainly da -eem that the Bombay Army, ' ' A less zmrus-worthy than was supposed, likely to exhibit any .eneral disaffection before the ability of the Government to grapple with revolt has been fairly insured. The mutiny of the 27th Regiment, reported by the last mail, is represented in a letter from Belgaum wvhich we published on MIonday as not embracing even the whole of that particular battalion, and, although from the statement that another corps had been disarmed we may presume that a second example of insurrection had been anticipated, that announcement comprised all the extension of the mutinous spirit reported from the Presidency of Bombay. A third Bombay Regiment-the 12th Igative Infantry-was indeed disarmed at Nusseerabad, but this station is in the Presidency of Bengal, and the Sepoys might very possibly have been exposed there to somo extraordinary temptations. The original garrison of the place, after revolting, as will be remembered, with every aggravation of violence, some time ago, marched off to Delhi, and the Bombay corps referred to formed part of a column which had been pushed up in support of our outnumbered forces in the North-Western Provinces. One feature in these transactions deserves especial notice, and that is the absence of the ferocious spirit which characterized the proceedings of the Bengal mutineers. The two Bombay Regiments appear to have been disarmed without any bloodshed, and it is expressly stated in the case of the 12th that the insubordination displayed by the men did not amount to active violence. This is not a day on which it would become us to enlarge upon the honour and renown which has been acquired for the country by the heroism of its sons, but in the midst of the affliction which we express we may console ourselves with the hope that the worst has now been told, and that we shall hear no more of those dreadful catastrophes which have Slled every household in the kingdom with horror. There wiU remain, indeed, but too many sources of anxiety still, but if we can trust the gleams which now break upon the horizon the darkness of the crisis is passing away. Two duties wiU then be incumbent on us. We shall be called upon to provide by foresight and vigilance against the like contingencies in future, and, as a more immediate obligation, we must draw upon the resources with which we have been blesed for the work of benevolence and relief. Let humiliation and sympathy go hand in hand, and, while we humbly acknowledge the visitation of EEAVn_V, let our hearts and our hands be open for the aid of those who have suffered more directly and more painfully than ourselves.

SIR COLIN CAMPBBLL AT CALCUf2TA. We (Nsorth Britih Mail) are happy to state that, from letters received in Glasgow yesterday forenoon, dated Calcutta, August 22, Sir Colin Campbell, who arrived there on the 14th of August, was in perfect health at Calcutta at that time, and had taken the command of the army. On the 17th of that month he issued the following proclamation to the troops in India:- " By T}IE CODInA.NDER-- C}iEF. "I HerMajesty having been graciously pleased to appoint me Commander-in-Chief of the forces in India, in the room of the late lamented General the Ron. George Anson, and Her Majesty having also been graciously pleased to confer upon me the rank of General in the East Indies, I now assume the command of the army in India. " In doing so it affords me the highest satisfaction to find under my orders troops wbo have eo fully proved themselves, in the recent arduous operations in the field, tobe what I have ever known British soldiers in every quarter of the globe-courageous, faithful, obedient, and enduring. "In former years I have commanded native troops of India, and by their side I have been present in many battles and victories in which they have nobly borne their part ; and it is to me a subject of deep concern to learn that soldiers of whom I had been accustomed to think so favourably should now be arrayed in open and defiant mutiny against a Government proverbial for the liberality and paternal consideration with which It has ever treated its servants of every denomination. " When I join the force now in the field restoring order to the district disturbed by the disaffection of the army of Bengal, I shall, at the head of the British troops, and of those native soldiers who, though few in number, have not feared to separate themselves from their faithless comrades and to adhere to their duty, feel my old confidence that they will maroh to certain victory. ' I shaU not fail to notice, and the powerful Government which I have the honour to serve will not fail to reward, every instance ot fidelity and valour sown by the troops under my command. I call upon the oicers and men of both European and native troops zealously to assist in the task before us; and, by the blessincg of God, we shall soon again see India tranquil and prosperous. "C.

HANTS ANfD WILTS ADULT EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY. BASINGSTOKE, OcT. 6. Iast evening at 5 o'clock a large party sat down to dinner at the Angel HoteL The Mayor (zr. P. S. Halbert) presided, supported by a large number of the clergy and gentry of the neighbourhood. After the usual loyal toasts had been drmnk The CH.IRNIAN proposed "The Health of the Members for North Hants." (Applause.) Mr. G. SCLAATER, hLP., in returning thanks, said he did sincerely rejoice that the subject of education by commnon consent appeared to be taken away from the House of Commons. (Applause.) Various attempts had been made to bring forward a great comprehensive scheme for the education of the people of this country. He thought it very fortunate that those attempts had been uniformly unsuccessful. (Applause.) From the indications they saw arould them, and also from what they heard, no such scheme would be propounded now, or, if Indeed, it was, it would not succeed in passing through Parliament. He thought it was very fortunate no such system would answer, and for various reasons. In the first place, he thought in their eagerness after a great comprehensive scheme people were too apt to forget what vas being done by local efforts tbroughout the country (ap. plause), and local effortswere much more in accordance with the renius of English people than was any centralized scheme coming from hea.dquarters. (Applause.) Great assistance, hle believed, could be given by the Government to local eflorts; but enormous sums of money would be spent by the country at large, rather than be under a centralized system . (Applause.) It was most graL.fying to observe the immense staides wh ch education had taken Fwithin the last few years. No one could look around and see the various schools that had sprung up, and others that had been Im. proved and enlarged, and not feel that nine-tenths of them owed their existence to the educational efforts of the last 10 years, He was highly gratified to see the efforts which were being made; they were producing far more satisfactory results than a House of Commons Act of Parliament. (Applause.) The Rev. MATTrrE;W HzmRmIsoN proposed " Success to the Hauts and Wilts Adult Education Society." (Applause.) He thought the highest credit was due to those who from such small beginnings had brought the Hants and Wilts society to occupy suoh an important position in the educational movements of the country,-a society which had received the patronage of the Prin^e Consort, and evoked sentiments and opinions from the greatest men of the awge. (Applause.) The meeting that bad been held that day was of a n ost gratifying character. (Applause.) The Hon. anud Rev. S. BEST returned thanks. He said he looked with considerable satisfaction to the efforts that had been made in that town and neighbourhood by the sodety in the cause of education, and the immense success which had attended their labours. Hle did most eamrestly hope that they might be permitted to see the objects they had in view much more generally advanced even than they were at that present moment. It was not using a trite expression to say that tha society was in its infancy. Much as it had done, and he oonaidered it had done a great deal towards this work, still, if they looked at the vast number of parishes and towns of consderable importance in which it had had no praotical weight they must be aware that a very large proportion of the work had yet to be done. In future they would have the co-operation and assistance of the Society of Arts and the two Universities. (Applause.) Through the agency they offered to them he hoped that the remaining objects of the society, which they bad yet only contemplated, and hardly in any degree attained to, would be carri edont, (Hear, hear.) With the pros peo,t then, which was before them of extended uselulnees, let him say a word to those -whom he had he hn-iour of addressing. All must entirely depend upon idividual exertion in the particular sphere in v. i:h each gentleman is placed. Notwithotand.r all the anxiety he and his coadjutors felt, and very deeply felt, in the movement, it was impossible for them, living in one spot, either to know how to lookout the various energies of the country for their purpose, or where most effectually to work, exoept through the information and assistance that was offered them by the local secretaries. (Hear, hear.) It they could only get those gentlemen who took a kindly interest in their proceedings really in their own small spheres to press and bring forward the objects of the society, and then point out in which wvay the committee could most advantageously second their efforts, in which way they could so unite so to economise both time and expense, it would be accomplishing a great end. (Applause.) The hon. and rev. gentleman conoluded by proposing " Success to the Basing3toke Institution." (Applause.) m r. W. PorsTA, the president, briefly returned thank-s. In the evening, at 8 o'clock, the Earl of CABNARVVON delivered a brilliant lecture at the Town-hall to a crowded and fashionable audience, on the IAter History of Hants, in the course of which his Lordship drew a graphic pieture of the Civil Wars, Basing-house, and the impriounment and death of Charles L The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledges I the receipt of 51. from " J.

AMERICA. IIVEItPOOL, TumsDAY. The United States' mail steamship Baltice Coinstock commander, arrived at midday, with advicec from New York to the 26th ult., and 66 passengers, but no specie. On the 5th inst. (yesterday) the Baltic pas,ed a large steamer, bound west, 125 miles weat of Cape! Clear. The steamship Antelope, hence, had arrived, idI St. John's, Newfoundland, at Halifax. The Royal Mail steamship Canada, hence, had arrived at Boston. There is no general news of importance or in. terest. Telegraphic advices from Washington mention a rumour of further difference between the United States and Spain. Preparation& for the election of the future President of the House of Representatives had commenced. The Democrats were the favourites. The schooner Eldorado, the captain of which had promised to lay by the Central America at 6 o'clock on the day she foundered had arrived at Boston, but had not on board a single soul from the ill-fated steamer. The captain admits that he was within 80 or 100 feet of the steamer at half-past 6 on the eG*ning of the disaster, and could easily have taken a line from her, on which most, if not all, of the passengers could have reached his vessel hand over hand. He says Captain Herndon did not order the passengers on board, his vessel. The steamship Cahawba had arrived at New Orleans with dates from Havannah to the 19th nlt. Business was dull, and sugar and molasses were declining. Exchange on New York was quoted at 2 to 3 per cent. premium. The monetary crisis had not, as had been anticipated, ceased, and the effeats of the stringency had caused serious resulta in Boston and Philadelphia, where failures were of daily occurrence. In the latter city there had been quite a panic, and a continuous run was made on all the banks. The Bank of Pennsylvania stopped payment, and the Girard followed suit. A private despatch stated that the run on all the banks was general, the excitement widespread, and the impresion was that by Saturday every bank in the city would be uaed up. In Boston and in Providence the specie basis of the banks was reduced to an uncomfortably lowr figure, and they were drawing to some extent upon the New York banks, they responding promptly to the calL In the New York market the current quotations for prime paper were 18 to 24 per cent., and for good endorsed notes 3 to 5 per cent. a-month. The comparative scarcity of funds was owing, it was believed, in a great degree, to private hoarding. In exchange very little had been donae for the Baltic, and prices were lower and irregular, and sellers pressing bills on the market obliged to accept lower rates. The rates were 6 to 7i per cent. premium on London; 5f. 30c. to 5f. 20c. France; and 35j to 36 Hamaburg. A buoyancy in the stock-market had occurred, but it was not maintained in consequence of the state of affairs at Philadelphia.

THE UNITED STATES. (FRom OUR izw YORE COR1E8PO2OjNT.) NEW YORK, SxPr. 2G, By the Ariel, which arrived the day before yesterday, wre get the British impressions upon tho panic that followed the downfall of the Ohio Life and Trust Company. The fact that the news has had time to travel across the Atlantio and return shows how long-continued has been a pressure that atUll remaais in unabated severity. The English judgment upon this case-substantially expresed, I take it, In The Times-must be confessed to be sound, and the advice given to the pablic has been justified by subsequent results. Months ago a combination. was made for the purpose of " bearing" railway securities. The parties interested grounded their operations upon the impossibility of carrying the weight of the railway floating debt through the financial pressure that always intervenes between the two crops. Starting from this basis, a systematic attack, to which I have several times called attention, was made upon the railway interest of the country. The same thing had been attempted in 1854, 1855, and 1856, founded upon the same reasoning. Specie always flows out between the crops, when there are no produce bills to remit. This inevitably produces more or less stringency in the money-market, and it was reasoned that if, by creating distrust, that stringency could be increased to a point where the effecting loans to railways would become impossible, a handsome " operation" could be made. In former years the scheme failed, notwithstanding short crops. This year, with great crops, it has succeeded, owing to the creation of railway indebtedness faster than capital could absorb it-owing also, it must be admitted, to gross mismanagement (in some cases amoumting to fraud) on the part of the roads themselves. The failure of the Mlichigan Southern, followed by the suspension of the Ohio Life and Trust, destroyed all confidence. Those failures found the banks of New York with $120,000,000 of loans and only about $9,000,000 of specie. Within the monththat has ensued the loans have been contracted nearly $14,000,000, and the specie increased over $5,000,000. This contraction has of course been severely felt by borrowers ; but its effect has been much lessened by the diminution of deposits. The specie gains have been rnade-$1,500,000 from CalL fornia-and the rest, partly at the expense of the interior and partly by disbursements from the national treasury. The usual remittances from Call fornia by the Central America were lost; on the other hand the European export has been entirely stopped, and exchange has gone to a point where specie can almost be sent from London at a prolit. While this has strengthened the New York banks, it has weakened those elsewhere. The country banks of issue, unable to keep out their circulation, have been returning it to the Controller for redemption. The large towns which have seemed to feel the pressure most are Boston and Philadelphia. The manufacturing interest in the former has been for a long time unprosperous, and a borrovrer. The sudden contraction has operated with great severity upon those most engaged in that business, and has caused heavy failures among the oldest and most respectable houses. The Boston banks have not been strong enough to sustain the public, and there is now a serious apprehension-not well grounded I trust-that they will not be strong enough to sustain themselves. Should they be driven to suspension, it would doubtless involve the suspension of all the New England county banks in self-protection. This once done, I question whether any worse stato of things would result than we now see. The outstanding bils would give a currency, and the specie would find its way to New York by ihe Datural law of gravitation. In Pennsylvania matters seem worse thau in Massachusetts. Two of the banks -the Pennsylvania and the Gerard-suspended yesterday, and the merchants of that town are undoubtedly in a tight place, judging from the number of failures. Baltimore is suffering somewbat from the same causes. The Western Circulars quote currency as plenty, and specie at a large premiuma decidedly unhealthy state of things; and it is not an impossible thing that, if the present want of confidence continues, there may be temporary suspension of the bank-s there as well as tn New England. Th, banks of neither section will resort to this expedient unless it becomes necessary to their own protection. But vwhatever may be the result, I still think- that this country is richer than ever before, and that there is no sound cause for the spreading want of confidence; and thinking so, I cannot believe that the storm will last as long as many people's fears predict. To begin with, the South is very rich. Its cotton has for many years met with ready sales at high prices, and its negroes have advanced and are advancing in value. The planters, who some years since were poor and generally six months or a year in advance of their income, are now rich, with their debts paid off, their plantations and negroes discharged from liens, and large accumulations in addition. The West, as a whole, are not as well off. The farmers are in debt ; but they have this year the greatest crops ever known, held at present at high prices. Even if those prices come down, which I fancy they must do, the farmers will still have the means of paying the instalments on their debts. The Western towns have overspeculated and overtraded. They are suffering, and probably will suffer more. They have been overtrading, stimulated by a radicaUy false system of paper money, a system which excites undue speculation, and gives fictitious value to property. When this country abandoned protection iR 1846 it adhered to paper currency. A paper currency at the West means the creation upon a very little specie of a very large amount of corporate obligations, which are received as money. An expansion in the circu. lation is naturally followmed by an expansion in values. While foreign goods were unnaturally kept out of the country by discrimina. ting duties, and domestic manufactures unnaturally forced by the same process, an equally unnatural condition of the currency did no harnL But when the foreign and the domestic manufacturers were put upon a par, except so far as otherwise necessary for purposes of revenue, the inequality in value upon the two sides of the Atlantic began to tell. It is under this system of false wealth, by which values of every kind of property are artificially enhanced, that the foreign imports have been stimulated to the unhealthy point which produced the present trouble. Goods bought at prices based upon a specie currency are sold at prices based upon expanded paper. Thte eane in creating currency has made home paymentb easy, while the foreign balances have been paid in coin or bullion, for which we looked to Cslifornia. The last Treasury statement showed that California had failed to sipply the deficiency by about $i5,00O,000. This contraction must speedily cbeck importations. When you see how smaU is the adverse balance on the total foreign trade (only about 5 per cent), you can see that with an average cotton crop, at the present rates, and a large grain crop, it ought to take but a short time of contraction to restore the equilibrium. Next, the railways of the country, whose recklem contraction of debt has laid their managers open to the suspicion of fraud, and has been one of the main causes of the present troubles, must be got out of the way as borrowers. The line of discounts of the banks of Now York varies from $106,000,000 to $120,000,000. It is estimated that the railway floating debt ia the " street' has averaged from $20,000,000 to

IRELA lND. (FROM OUR OWN CORRVIqPONnVRNT. DUBLI2N, TUMBDAY MORcoiNxe. AGRICLTURAL STATISTICS FOR 1857. Another elaborate statistical report has just been issued from the office of Mfr. William Donnelly, the indefatigable registrar-general. It consists of a general abstract of the total extent of land under the various crops, and of the number and description of live stock, by counties and provinces, for the year 1856 and 1857. The inquiries for this year commenced on the 2d of June, being the same date as in 1856. There is therefore not any disturbing element to take into account in comparing the returns of the present year with those of the one past. The report is addresaed to the LordLieutenant, and in as follows: " May it please your Excellenoy,-I had the honour on the 15th ult. of submitting a return of the acnrge under flax in each county and province in the years 1856 and 1857, respectively, and the increase or decrease in the latter year. I now beg to submit for your Excellency's conaideration general abstraots of the total extent of land under the various crops, and of the number and description of live stock by counties and provinces for the same years. As on former occasions, the information in these ab6tracts has been ob tainedby nearly4.000 enumerators selectedfromtheconstabu. lary and metropolitan police; and it is to me an agreable duty to state that they have performed the task entrusted to them in their usual efficient and satisfactory manner. The figures given in the tables are taken from towuland abstracts furnished by the enumerators, which for all practical purposes may be considered as correct, although on pasing in review the crops and stock on each farm in Ireland-as is done in classfioation of the holdings-some alterations may here after become necessary. The inquiries for this year commenced on the 2d of June, being the same date as in 1856 ; there Is therefore not any disturbing element to take into account in comparing the returns for 1857 with those of the previous year.

This addition to the extent of land under crops is composed of an increase in cereal crops of 2,508 acres-in green crops, of 45,637, and of the land under meadow and clover, 66,634 acres-making in all 114,779 acres, from which a decrease in flax of 8,237 acres is to be taken. In the cereal crops, wheat shows an increase of 33,531 acres in 1857, compared with the previous year; and barley, here, rye, beans, and peas, of 27,536 acres; but oats show a decrease equal to 58,559 acres. In green crops-potatoes continue to be more extensively cultivated, 42,216 acres having beoen planted in 1857 above the number returned for 1856 Turnips, on the contrary, have diminished, 4,487 acres less having been sown in 1857 than in 1856, in which year there were more than 12,000 acres under the quantity returned for 1855. Potatoes would, therefore, still appear to be the favourite green crop of the Irish farmer, Mangold wurtzel, | beetroot, vetches, and rape, also carrots, parsneps, and cab. bages increase in cultivation; 1857 exhibiting an extent in these crops above 1856 of 7,908 acres, and over 1855 of 12,858 acres-thus, in some degree compensating for the falling off in turnips. "It is interesting to notice this gradual increase of theland under tillage notwithstanding the continued emigration from Ireland, owing to which cause it is estimated that the population has decreased from 6,552,385 in 1851 to 6,047,492 on the 1st of January, 1857-(as shown In the remarks on emigration which accompanied the tables recently sub. mitted to your Excellency); and this number has been reduced to 6,015,768, to the 1st of September inst, UD to wbich dat-e the emigrants from Irish ports in 1857, s returned by the enumerators, were 72,186. To this dliminu. tion of the population the advance which has taken place in the price of labour may be ascribed, and as employment increases with an extending area under tillage the means and prospects of the working classes in this country must, it is confdently hoped, be permanently Improved. "According to the returns of live stock there were 6C0,693 horses in Irelmnd in 1857, being an increase over the number enumerated in the previous year of 27,285, of wbich 16.606 were horses used for agricultural pnrposes, 2,466 for traffic and manufactures, 2,469 for amusement or recreation, 1,779 were yearlings, and 3,965 under one year old. Cattle increased by 30,686 between 1856 ra.d 1857, the number returned in the latter year being 3,618,544; of these 1,602,908 were milch cows, 801,875 two years old and upwards, 606,01o5 were under one year old, and 597,746were one year old and under two years; these last decreased in 1857 by 23,361 compared with the same class in 1856. Pigs increased 333.627 since 1856, the number for that year having been 918,f25, and for 1857 1,252,152; the increase is made up of 34,037 one year old and upwards; and 299,590 under one year. Sheep show a decrease of 245,618 in 1857, of which 119,391 were ewes, 41,714 tups and wethers, and 84,513 lambs. The decrease in sheep may, I conceive, be attributed to a satisfactory cause-their increased exportation, which is now so much facilitated by railway communication.

I am now informed. that in some localities improvement has taken place; but oni account of the unchecked growth of weeds in so many places as well as in the fields and hedgerows of the slovenly and careleas farmer, the efforts of those desirous to effect their eradicationx are, in a great measure, frustrated. To the extensive circulation of the information given in the abstracts for 1856, as authori2ed by your Excellency, and to the able appeals on the suboject which have appeared in the public press this improvement may be attributed. Until legislation, however, affords some remedy to those who keep their lands free from weeds against such partles as allow them to grow and seed, to 'he injury of the adjoining lands, the practice of clean agriculture in Ireland cannot, I fear, be hoped for, because, if a farmer sees that the expense which he incurs in removing weeds is thrown away, owing to his careless neighbour poisoning the fields around with the seeds of noxious plants, he wil naturally feel that it is hopeless to eradicate them, as they are replaced by the vigorous stock growing on his neighbours holding. With a view to keep this subject before the agricultural community, I, last spring, Issued a circular to the several assistant barristers, soliciting their aid. It was most courteously received, many of them hang addressed the parties attending quarter sessions on the greae advantages vwhich must arise owing to the in. creased yield of land when kept free from weeds, as is clearly shown by the experiments of that eminent and distinguished man, the late Sir John Sinclari. So important has the subject become, that for an essay upon it a prize was awarded by the Royal Agricultural Society ofEungland last year. Thesuccessful author.Professor Buckman, of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, gives practical methods for remaoving weeds from the soil "It is satisfactory to state that the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society, the Royal Flax Society, and the North-East Agricultulral A ssociation, and many local farmsing societies, have aided this movement for the destruction of weeds. At a late meeting of the Royal Agrioultral Improvement Society at Waterford the following earnest and em. phac observations, which cannot fail to have a most bene- icial effect, werer addressed by your Excelency to a large and influential asemblage of landed proprietors and agricultorists: " I know that the total extinotion of weeds must be a work of time, and of gradual and continued effort, like all other great works; but Delhi has not yet fallen, and IriEh weeds are not yet extirpated; and I believe the one to be a ewpent6al to the real regeneration of Irish agriculture as the otber is to the martial glory and stability of the empire.'

TIH LATH FRAUDS uf BELFAST. The Belfast Nesletter of yesterday has some fuirther particulars in connexion with the recently discovered frauds in the Customs:- " Since the discovery of the extensive frauds every exertion has been made to arrest Mr. J. J. Moore, the person 'who is charged with being the perpetrator of this robbery. As soon as it -waa found that he had left Belfast the police in Dublin and Liverpool Were telegraphed to, and a description sent of his general appearance; and on Friday evening Inspector Shields, of the local police force of this town, left by the steamer for Liverpool, as it was considered that Moore would make for that port,fn order to sail thence for America at the earliest opportunity. A little before the Belfast steamer arrived in Liverpool the A.ia left that port with the mails forNew York, and Mr. Sbields was informedbyan officerof theLiverpoolpoice, thataperson answering the description given of hloore had as they were informed, gone by a small boat on board of the Ashamme- diately before sbe sailed, and the polfce wcre unable to reach I the vessel until she had got nder wy and steamed down I the river. A telegraph t thi effect was sent to Belfast,where immediate steps weretaken to,if possible, have him arrested before the Asia would get clear of the channel. A telegraphio despatch was sent to Cork, from 0. HLnt, Eaq., . , directing the constabulary there to engage a steamer and proceed outside there to watch the Asia, and endeavour to get on board of her and search for Moore, of whom a description was also sent them. Several gentlemen interested In the arrest of this delnquent proceeded, accompanied by Inspector M'Ilroy, of the Belfast police force, down the Lough in the I steamer Wonder on Sunday afternoon, with the object in view of watching for the Asa should she have sailed northward from Liverpool, and after gobig down somo distance they exchanged totheVesta, in which they hoisted the A = flag, and proceeded in her to the North Channel, where she remained all night and returned to our quays yesterday morning without having met with the Asia; and it is confidently stated that the American mail steamer could not go by the northern route without havingleen met by the Vesta, so that it is hoped those who had been on the look-out at Cork may have seen the steamer as she pae6ed that coast, and have been able to search her for Moore, and, if on board, to of course arrest him. The Asia must have been off the Cork coastat about 2o'clock yesterday morning, and intelligence of the success or nonsuccess of the efforts put forth is expected here this morning. It has been found that in leaving this town Moore went by car to Lisburn, and, when dispensing with the servioes of the vehicle there, he directed the driver to mneet him at the Ballymena Railway Terminus at 4 o'clock, and, if he should not arrive br that train to drive out for him to Saintfield, all of whioh the driver states he did, but of course failed in meetinag with Moore. who was at the time too much engaged in evading the telegraph and detectives, a work which, as far as we have yet learnt, he has succeeded in performing, and we would suggest to the authorities and those interested in his arrest that it is more than probable he has not yet departed from Ireland, and no exertions should be left untried to hsve him secured. We are inclined to tbink that Moore has not sailed in the Asia, and we are led to this belief from several reasons which it might not at present be judicieu3 to publish. We may mention, however, that Mr. Bristow, of this town, Is a pasenger on board that steamer, and it is not likely that Moore would go in the same vessel with a person who would at once know him. We merely state these matters as baing worthy of the attention of the authorities, who we hope vwil not frelin. quish thdr efforts to have Moore taken, even should the Asia not be met with, or, if maet, that he should not be found on board of her. During the course of Saturda a further examination of the stores was made, and we undersa'nd that several additional tea-chests were found filed with rubbishlike those previously discovered. The f entire frauds, it is estimated, will amount to about 10,0004, the one-half of this being the duty on the bonded goods, and the remainder the value of the property itself." BAI=ASLOF GREAT OCTOBEP FPAM. The following account of the first day's operations appears in Saunders's Newsletter of this day:- " Ballinaloe, Monday Evening, 5 o'dock. "The 4th October baving fallen on Sanday the show of sheep took place to-day. As was expected, there was a decline in the numners exhibited for sale compared with those of last year, but the fair must be considered, on the whole, a large one; and though I make this statement as my own opinion, there are many gentlemen who are fully in the belief that there is no decrease in numbers. The Connaught flock. masters entered the racea park of GarbaUy this moraing, fully confident that prices would rale hlgher than usual; in fact, that they might demancd and obtain what they pleased. For a length of time business was very dolL Sellers held out for long prices, and buyers refased to make any concesaions. Transactions were rather dull up to 12 o'clock, when the rain commenced to fall in torrents. The previous night had unfortunately been a wet one, hut towards daylight, the morning having cleared, the sheep bad considerably improved in their appea-- ance. No doubt the early sales were affected by this ir. cumstance, but it was to no purpose after midday, for from that time we experienced a regular deluge. Notwithstanding this the prices obtained for sheep surprised Gvery one. The anticipations of a decrease in the numabers of sheep arose from the statement of the Earl of Carlisle atthe Waterford exhibition-I mean the announcement founded on the returns of the Registrar-General, to the effect that there was a material diminution In the number of sheep throughout the entire kingdom, and as a matter of course, the circumstance would have its effect at Ballinasloe, the great national emporium for the sale of live stock. When business commenced which was at 8 o'clock, there was a demand for aU classes of sheep. Wethers brought very high prioes, and the advanme over last year Was from Cs. to 6s. per head. Young ewes weze also purchased at a considerable advanoe, but towards evening there was rather a reaction, at least ia the case of old ewes." (BY SPECIAL TELEGRAPHI.)

DISCOURAGRMENTS TO RBCRUITIVG. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-These are legion. Sir Henry Hardinge, AdjutantGeneral, in his evidence before a committee of the House of Commons, showed that for a nominal pay of 13d. a-day the soldier received but a groat at most, ano he must be a carefal man who obtains more than 2Ad. This is a constant cause of desertion, especiaUy among the youngest, and not unnaturaUy, for the first step of enlistment begins with a fraud. The artifice is thus managed :-Sergeant Kite tenders a scanty bounty of 21. or 31. to the lad Simple, and, that done, retains all of it for necessaries, save some 10s.,-that is for clothing and other equipments, which, if honest, the State ought to furnlsh. There has been some slight amendment in this of late years but still the list of reductions is long-very long and dis. honest. If you could allow room I could enumerate the 16 or 18 diffesent items which the recruit has to buy oat of his 13d. The Iniquitous bargain concluded, the 10s. duly laid out In drink, the contract is cemplete. The State then oomes into the possesion of a man of good strength and stature, in the flower of life. The best thing that can befall him Is to go to India, for his pay is there doubled, and many in. dulgences allowed; navertheless, not near so many as to the Sepoys, with what result we now 4ee, and he often remain 10 years or more in that empire. The Company is, indeed, generous, but tha State niggard, for his pension is but 6dor 8d. a-day, scarcely enough to keep him from the workhouse. A nation X this, of which the bulk will not cndure to fight in peucn, which shrinks from a Militia ballot, should be thaukl bfoi such a supply of vahant and able men; but, unfortuately, we have been so nobly seecre, " and have in conqui*.satetched our a,ms sc. far," that the ungenerous grud &tbe Teast addition to this stipend, scanty as it is.

"The regulations regarding the re-enlistment of men who have formerly served remain in force. " By command of his Royal Highness the General Con. Snanding-in-Chief, " G. A. WETHBRALL, Adjutant-General." The Austria, with the 94th, sailed from Cork on Sunday afternoon forlndia; the Great Britain, with the 8th Royal Irish Hussars and 17th Lancers, was expected to be in readness on Wednesday or Thursday next; the Calcutta awaits the arrival of the 51st from Dublln; and the Pritimes Charlotte was hourly looked for to take ont the head. quarters of the 18th Royal Irish, with detachments. The 17th Lancers left Dublin for Cork by railway at the early hour of 5 o'clock on Tuesday morning. Orders have been received at the Provisional Battalion, Chatham, for accommodation to be provided for the depOt companies of the 18th (Royal Irish), 33d (Duke of `ellington's), and 98th Regiments, numbering about 300 officers and men, who are now under orders to join the battalions at that garrison on the embarcation of the service companies of their regiments for Indis. The steamship Robert Lowe was spoken with on the 26th of August, in lat. 2 N., long. 22 W., with part of the 1st Royal Regilment on board; and the ship Baliarat was spoken with on the 2d of September, with the second division of the 3d battalion of the 60th Rifles. No latitude or longi. tude stated. The rapidddem-nds now made for the supply of war equipments required by the East India Company have rendered it necessary to increase the establishment of Woolwich Arsenal to a considerable extent, the carriage department being raised to the same footing as during the Crimean war. No difficulty has been experienced in obtsining artificers and labourers of every class, and as soon as it became known that hands were ordered to be taken on the gates were thronged by upwards of 1,000 applicants. The following addition has been made in the carriage departmentSnatiely, 580 labouLrers, 240 wheelwrights, 170 smiths and assistants, 110 carpenters, S0 collarmakers, 30 painters, and 12 tinmen,-total, 1,222; making the aggregate number in that department, as during the Russian war, 2,500 men. The freightship Francis has commenced shipping war stores from Woolwich for Freemantle. The Renown, 91, new screw steamship, proceeded out on her trial trip of her machinery on Monday. Her average speed was 101 knots by patent log. Her engines made 53 to 54 revolutions per minute with 201b. pressure; vacuum, 251 to 26; pitch of screw, 29 feet; diameter, 19 feet; length line of keel, 3 feet 6 inches. Her nmachinery in every respect worked very satisfactorily. The Bacchante arrived at Sheerness yesterday, at 7 p.m. The Avon steam-ve3sel arrived at Sheerness yesterday from Woolwich to convey supernumeraries from the flag. ship to Portsmouth to join the Ganges. THE MILITIA. The Leicestershire MMiitia has obtained Its ful quota of men, and now numbers upwards of 1,0.50. The regiment was quartered at Aldershott In the winter of 1S55--6, and remained there until the conclusion of the tresty of peace with Russia. Both officers and men are anxious to be called into active service, and are prepared for any duty at the present crisis. The Roscommon Militia have volunteered for India wlthout a single exception. It is believed that their services will be accepted.
TEE RMUBDER IN CHESHIRE. The adjourned inquest on the body of James Elenderson, farmer, of Bramas (or, a9it is otherwie called, "Bramhall") Cheshire, who was aot while in bed on Wednesday morno Ing last, w held at tbe Victoria Inn, near the Bramall station of thw Xaclesfield Railway. The oroner, Mr. W. Johnson, took his seat At 10 o'clock. The jury was principally composed of farmers, and Mr. Marsand, a landowner of the neighbourhood, was the foreman. Mr. W. P. Roberts, solicitor, Manchester, appeared for James Hender. son, deceased's eldest son, who was present in custody. The, polce description of the prisoner is-" height, ft. 4in.; com. i plexioa, light; eyes, hazel, sharp and deeply sunk in the fore. head; hair sanily cheeks very hollow." He was brought from the Stockport county lookup in a cab by Ir. Soperintendent Andrews and Lr. Little, deputy constable, of the Cheshire I County Constabulary. A conslderablo crowd of country people, many of whom must have been known to him, were congregated round the door on his arrival, and on alighting trom the vehicle hi lips quivered and he appeared some. what nervous. The township of Bramall is composed of, scattered detached farms and cottages, and the population i 's about 1,800 in number. The scene of the murder is about three-quarters of a mile west of Brasmall.hall, the seat of Colonel Davenport, the owner of the farm, which is an ancient brick and timber mansion, said to have been erected in the reign of Richard III. The jury roomn was exceedingly crowded with people, some of whom had come from Stockport, and many of them from the village of Hazlegrove, which is only a couple of miles eaSt and Cheadle, about the same dstanoe west, of the town: ahip. Michael MIalockney, sworn.-I am a farm labourer, and was in the service of the late Mr. Henderson at the time of his death. I lived on the farm, and slept in the granary with John DiUon, a fellow servant. It will be 15 weekh to-mor. row sinco I entered his service. On Tuesday night last, the 29th of September, I went to bed at half.past 8 o'clock, and DiUon did the samne. I was awoke about 2 o'clock. I suppose it was by the prisoner, who called from the kitchen or pantry for me to get up quick. I commenced dressing. Mv sister also lives as servant there, and she and the prisoner came and called again soon afterwards, and desired me to "come down smart," and not to dress. I and Dillon then went down and found the prisoner in the kitohen with agun in his hand. The prisoner's brother Thomas was there, my sister, and Blaize, a servant lad. Prisoner asked if we had heard anything, and we said, we did not. He said. " Come up stairs, there are robbersabout the house." I went upstairs, but we (James, and Thomas, and I) first went into the cellar. We found that there was no one there. He then said, "Come upstairs and we'll trythe rooms." We all then ent upstairs. James (the prisoner) the went into one of the bedrooms, but not that ehihdeceased lay. He had a candle and only looked inside that room, and then he went into deceased's room. 'lhe door was not open, because I saw him raise the latch. We followed him in, his brother Thomas following first, and then myself and Dillon. The prisoner said, " Come on out, my father is killed." He had not been up by the side of the bed, but he went a little past the foot of it. Hle did not touoh his father, nor did Thomas. We then left the room. No soarch was made to see if anything had been taken. The prisoner then went into his mother's room, and 1 heard him tell his mother his father had been killed. I did not go into her room, and did not hear whether she made him any reply. I did not hear any shriek nor any ex1ressions of grief. We next went down to the back kitchen door, when the prisoner gave the gun to his brother to fire, and Thomas discharged two shots, one after the otler, outside the kitchen door. The prisoner then took us into his sitttnn room, and sbowed us his leathen desk (like that produced), which bad been broken open. He went and examined the desk, and said, " Here's where my money was, and it has been taken out." I think he said there was 151. lNs. We all then went into the kitchen, and the prisoner and Thomas told us (me and Dillon) to go and dress ourselves; we did so, and returned. We found the prisoner and Thomas, when we ieturned, in the back kitchen, and Dillon was sent with Thomas to fetch the police. The prisoner and I remained by the kitchen fire to guard the house. While I was there my sister came dowv. The prisoner asked me out after the others had gone-about five minutes after-to look at my bedroom door, which is outside the house. He said, "Come, Mick, let's go look at your door." He had a light in his hand, and went up the steps to the door before me. I was openng the door to go in, and he said, "Oh, Mick, look whats . your door," and he got hold of a piece of wood that was stuck in the latch. [The door is fastened outside by a wooden latch, and persons inside could only open it by putting one finger through a hole umder the latch.] The piece of wood he showed me sticking in the latoh was about the size row shown to me. I said, "Oh, James, what put this here 1" and he said, " That's a bit of wood put there to keep you in." We retarned to the kitchen, and soon after the prsoner asked me to come from the fire into the back kitchen. He told me to stop there while he went to look about the hedges and ditches, and I did so. lie took no light with him, nor any weapon. He remained away nearly half-anhour. W'hen he retumed he asked me to go upstairs with lim, and I went into his own bedroom with him. He went to his drawer or box, I cannot say which, and he pulled out some papers and put them into his pocket. He did not go into the deceased s chamber again, but went downstairs to the fire again. Here he pulled a quantity of papers out of his rocket and threw them into the fire and burnt them. One f the pieces fell out and he got hold of it and put it into he fire again. My sister Nancy was presentat the time. The prisoner, who was taking notes at a table behind his attorney, here handed a slip of his notes to Mlr. Roberts, but | the latter founded noquestion upon it. Witness continued.-I have seen deceased and the pri. soner together in the harvest, but I never saw them speak together. I never heard them speak together at meals, but the old man usually took his meals alone. By Mr. Roberts.-It was not long after we were called ! before we went into the oellar. I should think it might be I five minutes, bat not much more. I never saw the old man ax.d the prisoner eat together, or talk together, but I bave seen the whole of the rest of the family walking together and talking. By the Coroner.-The old man was not there then. I never saw them speak together. I never saw any falling out among them, but they never spoke. By hMr. Roberts.-The deceased was a good, tenderhearted master, and kind father to his children. All of them, so far as I saw, were well-behaved to him. The prisoner used to go out at 8 o'clock to Manchester every morning, and sometimes returned at 7 o'clock, or later, in the morning. The old man used to rise at half-past 4 soumetimes, and went out with us milking. Don't know what time the prisoner usually rose in the morning. The fire was lh vwhen the prisoner put the paper in. By the Coroner.-He did not put anythgng else on the fire besides the papers, By Mr. Roberts.-Did you see any difference between the conDout of James with his father and the others? The Coroner thought this was not a proper question, and asked the witness whether the other members of the fiamily talked with the father.-Witness said, the others talked with the father a good deal. By Mr. Roberts.-Never ssw any difference between the conduct of James and other members of the famUy towards the father, except that these two neser spoke togethor. James (the prisoner) never attended to the farm business as far as I sow, but when he came home at night he would talk to us. John Dilon, farm labourer, sworn,-I had been in deceased's service 14 or 15 weeks, and slept on Tuesday night last with Maluckney. I was called up at the same time as mv fellow-servant. I only put on my trousers. James said when we got into the kitchen that there were robbers about. Went upstairs with James, and. Thomas, and M,Iichael, and Nancy, and Blaize. James went into a bedroom, and returned, and went into his father's room. The door was shut, but I cannot say whether it was latched. Hie went to the end of the bed, or a little beyond it. He wvent furthest into the room, He did not examine the body or touch it. He said either, "M My father is killed," or "* y father is shot," but I am not sure which. NSo further search was made in deceased's bedroom, and we came outand prisoner went into his mother's bedroom, and told bis married sister, Mrs. Barlam, that his fAther had been. killed. I and Maluckney afterwards went to-dress, and I went for the police. John Blaise or Blease sworn.-I am a formlabourer, .and entered the service of the deceased last Monday week. r elept in the attic with a servant boy, and Thomas Rendor- i son slept in the same room. I went to bed on Tuesday, night about 8 o'clock, and the boy with me. About 2 o'clock in the morning I heard the dlsoharge of firearms. I heard a second discharge directly afterwards. I then got out of bed and commenced dressing. Thomas, who had got out immediately before I did, was also dressing. I beard nothirg after the second report-no noise of. any. I kind. I afterwards heda James call: Thomas, aid say, " Thomas, there's robbers in the house." Thomas- went down fire-, and I iollowed directly. When I got to the second lending, upon which the bedsooms of the flst floor open, 1 saw the prisosier James standing at his bedroom door, and he bad a double-barrellei gun in one hand and a candle in the othez, and said tbe:s were robbesm In the house, The candle flame was hll, as though it had. been lighted some time. He was in his nightgown. He had no nightcap on. I ob6arved, as we stood onthelanding, that deceaed's door was- shut. I went down with. James and Thomas into the kitchen, the prsoner Jame3 cing the gun. I did not hess him charge the gun an in.; When we got down someonemsaidthe kitchen door was open, I looked, and found it so. After this James knocked fot the i-ash men-servants, ank they came shortly afterwards. We then searched the house, Thomas anl Michae going into the cellar, and then we. went upstairs. We want into. deceased's bedroom last ,and found that bh had been shot. No examination or search cet the room wr n made. I after. wards returned to bed, being very cold. 1 did r,&t see-the gun charged again after :) came down.

All the family were friendly together. I never heard anr quarrelPng. Tbe old man was a ttige hasty, but I never took any notice. I never sawthe broken braces produced before. I do not recollect seeing James and his father ever walking alone together in the fials. All the family used to dine together on Sundays, George OAwald Ax4rows, superiotaitdentof polio&, swora. -I received information of this murder between 3 aud 4 o'clock on the morning of Wednesday lsat, September 30, and wvent to the spot immediewly. I met with the two brotbers, James and Thomas eIenderson, at the honse, I had taken 5ergeaat Cooper with me. I said, " You have had something seriote here." James aid, "Yes." I said, " Have khey taken anything r" aEd he said " Yes, they have broken open my writing desk and taken 141 lOs. in golU" The sitting-room door wLas open, and' r went In. James poioted to the writing desk produced, which lay open on tne table. He pointed rhere the money wua taken from, and he picked up tie bras fastenit g, saying it had been broken from the writing case. We had a candle, but I made a slight examination of it only. I then locked the door and brought away the key. Io the' passageI asked how the entrance had been efrectIed; and James satd that he had found the back door open, anD that he supposed Fonme one must have got in during the early part of the Light, concealedthemrelves in thecellar, aud afterthe family kad gene to bed had let the rest of the gang iato the house. ie sad he had been up last, seeing all the doors fast; that be went to bed about half-pas' twelve, and- thought he heard a shuffling noise, which caused hin to turn several steps back, but all was then quiet, and he went to bed. I examined the ontside doors, but there were no marks of violence upon them. I did not then examine the front door. Myself and James and Thomas and one or two-officers then went upstairs, and James pointed out a pne of glass on the landing that had been broken by his havmg shot at a man he had seen standing on the stair, I said, -Did you think you hit him?" lie said, "Yes, for he uttered an exclamation as if he was hurt." I examined the landing where tbo man was said to hLve been standirg, but could find no traces of blood. We then weut to the next landing to James's room, and at say request he got the double-barrelled gun and showed me. the position in which he stood when he fired. r a,kid what was the very first thing he heard, and be- said tEe report of firearms in his father's room, upon which, he said he jumped out of bed, seized a gai that was against the drawers, opened his bedroom door, and, seeing the outline of a man against the window on the landing, he immediately fired at him. I said, "Did you not call out before you cred, because itmight have been your brother or some one cf the family." He said, " No, I did not." I asked what rext took place, and he said he could see a light from his father's room, but the moment he fired it was extinguibhed and two men rusbed out down the stairs, and he believed from the noises there were two or three persons more outside the house. He said the feet of all the men were muffled. 1 then went into deceased's room. I found the deceased lying upon his back in bed with a severe wound on the face, the face blackened as if from au explosion ef powder, and I .oticed that the features were placid, so that I formed the opinion that he must have been shot while asleep. His Irms lay upon his chest and were crowsed. k table that stood under the window was pointed out by the prisoner as the place vbere the old man kept his anomey. I found the top looked, and the table had no appearanee of having bten disturbed. The room struck me as- in a remarkable state of neatness and order, considering what I had heard bad taken place. There was a piece of caryet by the bedside which had not been disturbed. I then locked the room and went to make inquiry at Stockpert about a discharged marn-servant. I returned albout 9 o'clock in company with Messrs. Graham and Son, surgeons, of Stockport, and called their particular attention to the position of the body as to whether deceased had been shot while asleep. I then made a search of the bedclothes and picked up about 12 pieces of paper on the body and bed and side of the bed, which appeared to have been used as the wadding of the firearms with wFhich deceased was shot. They are blackened with powder and singed. They are now produced in the state in which I found them. They were in places where they might be expectd to be foand if a gun bad' been discharged at the deceased, at or near the foot of the bed. I also produce two teeth found there. I then made a minute search upon the stairs where James had said. the man stood that he fired at. 1 wvas assisted in-this search by Sergeant Hamnmond, and we picked up a n-amber of pellets thathad been flattened with the diachat-ge against the wall, and Sergeant Hammond picked up what appears to have been the wadding of the gun and handed it no me. I afterwards found in the prisoner's bedroom, in the chamter-pot, two pellets. Mr. Little, the deputy chiefl-constable, was then assisting me, and I saw him take fromu the cham. her-pot the piece of paper produced, and he took from the ame utensil a spent cap. oUpon the floor of the chamber I found a quantity of shot and another spent cap. These I produce. 12 of the shot or peUets, and 12 of the flattened pellets found on the stairs I delivered to Mr. John Grabam, and saw hini compare them with pellets he had in his possession (taken from the body of deceased) and weigh tnem together, 12 of each, and they were precisely the same weight. In the dressiagrooi table I founda a numher of publications called TZ7c Cottagc Girt or the Mars-icc Dav,. A portion of one of these I DOW produce, The pages are 1185, 1186, j11 and 1200. On one of the pieces of wvad taken from deceased's bed room were the consers of pages 1,197 and 1,198, the fourth figure heing torn off. There is letterpress also on the piece of yaper. I produce a perfect uum ber of the same publcation commencing with page 1,185, and coeoloding with 1,200, which has been since purchased. Mr. Roberts said he objected to this as iot evidenmce The Coroner overruled thc objection. The witness continued.-It contains the whole of page 1,198. and on comparing the pieces of paper I found in deceased's room with this perfect copy of the work I find many of the same words on each: and on comparing the wadding found on the stirs, and the piece of the paper found in the chamber-pot in the prisoner's room, I find they contaiu the sanie matter as that on the lower parts of the same page. I examined the door of the granary, and found the pieces of wood now produced, one being in the latch and the other at the bottom of the steps, being picked up by police-constable Smeaten. The prisoner, James Henderson, was not at home at this time. Before I left the first time be said he was cashier to a firm in Manchester; that it was ef importanco he should go down there, ae he had keys and books that would hinder the husinese. I told him there could be no objection to his going; but desired him to get back as soon as possible to assist in the inquiry. He returned in the afternoon, and in a little tiine after I told him 1 should arrest him on the charge of committing this murder. He said, "Indeed I Upon what grounds 7" I said, "Grounds of strong suspicion, and you will be detained till the matter has bee5 further investigated." He said," Very well, I sappose I may speak to my mother i T said he might, and he vwent to ask her to get him a cup of tea, He also took a handful of gold and silver from his poc}et, w hich he gave into his mother's hands, bult w hich 1 took fromu her and found to be 71 l 10s. in gold and 9s. in silver, which he said he hadhad front his brother Thomas, and which the latter sa.d he had given him to pay some bills. By Mr. Roberts.-I searched aboat the house that morsing, and had several officers about and around the prentises making a minute search during that and the following day. M1y attention was not drawn to any footsteps. Two days afterwards t heard there was a faint mark of a clog under the window at ore sad of the house, butknowing one of the servants had clogs on I thought itof nO importance sv lorag after the murader, I noticed also two ladders that were in the orchard to get fruit with. One of them would reach the window referred to. From the quantlty of blood wihich had fieed from the deceased I should say a person standing ci~es by the side of the b.d wvould be likely to-e sprinkled with it. Deceased lay with his head on the pillowr, and fromx the mouth a stream of blood extended ovet the side of the bed and on to the fior, where there was a pool of it party by the side of the btd and partly under it. By the Coroner.-In deceasedla waistcoat pocket, harging at the foot of the bed, I found a key which opened the table drawer, anid there I found an order for 1001. on the Bank of Scotland, a hank receipt for 9:U., and five sovereigns and Os. in sUver and copper money. In one of tho pocket of deceased I alsfsnd a shlling. Atthis stage of the inquiry the Coroner and jury retired for refreshments, and on the re-assembling of too. Court it was found that a juryman was missing. A messenger was despatched in search of hm, but our report had to be de spatched before his return.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FIOaM OUR OWN CORRVApaPzn'T)v'P % fThe foUowing appeared in our second editton of yesterdav - PARIS. MoNaDYv, ocTr. 5, 6 P.x. It is positively known that the Narvaez Ministry resigned on the 1st inst., and there is little doubt that on the 3d their resignation was accepted. This last piece of intelligence is not official, but there are grounds for relying on the private telegram that brings it. For some time past the Cabinet has been reported very insecure, in consequence of its disagreements with the Palace. NevertheIess, only a few days ago we were assured that the Queea 'was resolved not to part with her advisers, and that she smiled on them more graciously than ever. To those acquainted with that illustrious lady's character such smiles would seem a dangerous symptom. We have as yet no authentic details of the crisis. It is said that the father of Senor Nocedal was included in a proposed new batch of Senators, and that the Queen positively objectel, saying that it was already quite enough to have the son where he was. General Lersundi, it was reported, had undertaken to form a new Ministry, 'vhich would probably be merely one of those shortlived Cabinets known in Spain as Ministries of transition. Bravo Murillo, who -was in Paris, left last night for Madrid. If he be a candidate for office, which he certainly was not when the Cortes were sitting, he has probably a good chance of being shortly Prime Minister. Things are folowing their old course in Spain-each ! successive Government more and more retrograde, until one arrives which the nation votes unendurable, and then up go the barricades. This was the way in which the revolution of 1854 was brought I about, and it will be not in the least surprising if 1858 or 1859 witnesses another, brought on in like manner, but probably more (serious and sanguinary1 in its nature. The wheel turns round till absolutism, or something tantamount to it, attains the ascendant; then this suddenly goes under, and anarchy reirns in its stead. | tt was lately reported that the charge for admission to the Bourse, which, when first imposed, caused so much grumbling and aflbrded a famous theme for the Charivari, was to be abolished, but the papers now say that no such idea has been for a moment entertained. They give at the same time some particulars of additions that are to be made to the Bourse, in the shape of four guardhouses, one at each corner of the edifice, and which are to be occupied rerpectivelyby firemen,SGardes deParis, Ser gen~s de Ville, and guardians of the building. Mloreover it is said that the iron railings on either side of the BourseI are to be thrown back, so as to enclose the two open spaces upon which peoplo can now meet and walk without payment, and that these plots of ground 'will be planted and laid out as gardens, in which speculators can agreeably saunter while discussin:. the rise and faLL This union of floriculture and stockjobbing is a noveltyworthyof originating in the tastefal capital of France, where ease and luxury are carried to their utmost limit. It wil be delightful for the weary agent de change to escape from the din and steam of the parquet to the tranquillity of shrubberies fragrant with roses, and for the couli3sier, unprosperous in his ventures, to seek relief for his agitated mind in the contemplation of natare's beauties. The cultivation of stocks will, of course, be most successfully pursued in these new gardens, and doubtless all the inmates of the four guardhouses will not be too many to restrain the bulls and bears from ravaging the parterres. While discussing-many in a friendly, some few in a hostile spirit to England-the events and chances of tbe Indian insurrection, none of the Paris papers can refuse their admiration to the heroic efforts of the few scanty battalions of Europeans scattered among and making head against tens of thousands of enemies. And while acknowledging, some few of them unwillinaly enough, the often-proved gallantry and invincible tenacity of the British soldier, they are also compeUed to applaud the energy and self-confidence with which the British nation meets its disasters. " 7Ces &rraves .egis sont dignes d'gtre Frangais r" exclaimed a French paper the other day, when recording the exploits of a handful of English opposed to a host of Sepoys. Although this may excite a smile in England, I need not say that, in a Frenchman's mouth, it is the very highest form of praise. Today a journal remarkable for its hatred of EGngland contains, in its review of the financial wreek, the following paragraph: "In London no business is doing. Nevertheless, Consols keep up, notwithstanding the gravity of the news from India. This is one of the most curious phases of, the English financial market, and can be explained only by the national pride af a country vwhich will not avow its embarrassments, or perhaps even which is so convinced that the resistance to its domination will be overcome that It awaits with patience the hour of its definitive triumph. 'What is quite certain is, that all the circumstances are formally and incontestably productive of decay and feeble' ness, and that by a moral energy for which one cannot give tro great credit (dotnt on ne' peut savoir trop grn) to the national spirit that inspires it, nothing is betrayed outwardly of the efFects of the gigantic struggle in which England sees herself engaged." The camp of Clhions now occupies very little space in the columns of the Paris papers, but one or two official journals still publish details concerning it. To-day's Constitu tionnel says that the works in progress of execution by the engineers leave no doubt as to the permanent character of the military establishment in the plain of Chalons; that it is presumed that a division of 5,000 men will pass the winter at the camp, not under canvass, as the Guard at present is, but hutted; and that the accessory buildings (ambulance, commissarlat, &c.), now of boards, will be reconstructed of brick and stone. The soldiers have been amusing their leisure by carving out of blocks of the abundant chalk rock, which is easily extracted and cut, tokens of their passage. In several parts of the camp are to be seen busts of the Emperor and Empress, eagles, castles, even staties as large as life ; and some of these images are very cleverly done. Several painters have visited the camp to make studies and sketches The tenth grand iraneumvre took place on Saturday, the Emperor commanding. The Empress accompanied him on horseback, and his suite included Marshals Pelissier and Magnan, and some foreign officers, Lord Itokeby, who commanded the Engliah Guards in the Crimea, being one of the number. The Minister of War has fixed the 18th inst. for the erection, at Nogent le Rotrou, of a statue to General St. Pol, killed at the attack on the Little Redan on the 8th of September, 1855. uiumerous foreign orders continue to arrive here for alides de Paris, jewelry, bronze ornaments, and furniture. Those received from England and the United States, however, are not so extensive as in former years. Complaints are still heard from many manufaetturers of the difficulty of finding a sufficient number of skilful workmen to execute the orders on hand. The retail trade of Paris is likewise becoming more animated. A part of the population, which emigrated during the summer, either to the sea side or to the bathsof Germany, has returned, and the fancy shops begin to exhibit their winter fashions. The accounts from the provincial manufacturing towins are likewise generally favourable. The manufacturers of Lyons have received large orders from the shopkeepers of Paris, but not sufficient to keep theru fully employed. Fortunat-ey for them there has been a rapid ail in the price of raw silk within the last 15 days, particuarly in China silk, which is quoted at a reduction of 20f. the kilogramme. This fall causes the commission agents to demand better terms of the manufacturers. The Lyons manufacturers complain that the fall is a trifling relief in comparison with the injury they receive from the manufacturers of mixed silk and woollen stuffs in the north of France, who deprive them of many of their oldest customers. Their usual orders from the United States have not arrived, and the last letters received from New York represent the market as glutted with silk goods, which are selling by auction under cost price. Trade is active at Mulhouse, with a rise in the price of cotton goods. Accounts from Rouen state that prices are kept up by the light stocks on hand. 30 balea of raw silk were sold at Marseilles last week at prices varying from 30f. to 90f. the kilogramme. The price of wheat contf-'jes to decline. The last Paris market was abundantly supplied, and sellers were forced to submit to a f urther reduction of 75c. the hectolitre. Choice samples were offered at 32f. SOc., good at 31f., and ordinary at 29f. per 120 kilogrammes. The millers refutsed to buy, and declared their intention to wait for lower prices. The price of flour has declined in the Paris market 2f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The flour factors returned 2,825 sacks sold on Saturday, of which 226 were for immediate delivery, at prices varying from 60f. to 5Sf. the sack, and 2,691 for future doelivery, at from 50f. to 56f. The reserve in the Paris market stores now amounts to 15,237 quintals. The cornmarkets in the departments are all lower. The farmers everywhere appear desirous to realize, and the average price ia quoted under 20f. the hectolitre. There has been but little change in the price of sugar this week in Paris. A cargo from Bahia was sold at Marseilles at 46f. the 100 kilogrammes. There was a brisk demand for refined sugar for exportation at 56f. Notwithstanding the storms and inundations which lately ravaged various localities in the departments of the Ardeche, the Herault, and the Var, the accounts of the vintage are in general most satisfactory. The quantity of winoe will exceed on an average all previous calculations. It is true that in some parts of the Beaujolais there will not be more than half an average crop. The price of wine has not varied within the last week at Bercy. The accounts of inundations in the south have raised the price of spirits in Paris. Fine beetroot spirits of wine are quoted at 113f., being an advance of 7f. the hectolitre.

According to the Constantinople correspondence of the Indlpendance Belge, the Ottoman Government has issued a circular note to its representatives at foreign Courts, protesting against the union of the Danubian Principalities. It founds its arguments upon the indisputable rights of the Porte and the maintenance of the integrity of the Turkish Empire. It appeals to the sentiments of equity of the Powers interested, and expresses the hope that its just request will be taken into consideration. At the same time the Turkish Government expresses its willingness to accept, as regards the internal reorganization of the Principalities, any reform compatible with the suzerain rights of the Sultan, and considers that the idea of separation does not exclude that of an assimilation in the government of the two provinces. AUSTRIA, (snOs OUnR OWN coRRsrPoNDzNT.) VIENNA, Ocr. 3. Yesterday evening it was generally stated here that the Emperor of Austria would pay a short visit to the King of Prussia, but the information which you a few days since received from me relative to His Majesty's intentions proves to be correct. The Emperor Francis Joseph left WYeimar at half-past 2 in the morning of the 2d inst., and at a quarter after 10 he passed through Dresden on his way to Bohemia. As has already been said, His Majesty will meet the Empress at Gmilnden on the 4th inst., and accompany her across the lake to Ischl. The period of their Majesties' return to Vienna is not yet fixed, but they will hardly quit Ischl before the end of this mouth. The chamois are said to be very numerous this year, and are likely to give the Emperor, who is passionately fond of shooting, plenty of occupation. Of the meeting between the two Emperors at Weimar nothing more is known than that they appeared to be on the best possible terms, and were closeted together two or three hours. Several letters written by inhabitants of Stuttgart to their friends and relatives in this city have been read to me; but they contain hardly any intelligence which is not to be found in the detailed reports of your special correspondent. The only fact of importaince mentioned by the Stttgarters is, that a alight t-emstimm'wg dissonance) was observable at Court after the arrival of the Empress of Russia. The principal topics of conversation in this city are the state of things in India, and the state of the Austrian money-market. The officers belonging to the scientific branches of the Austrian army take great interest in everything that occurs in India, and some of them seemed greatly disappointed when they learned that General Havelock had not succeeded in reaching Lucknow. Of counre, the military men who are on the spot must beat know what ought to be done, but it may be as wvell to mention that several highly distinguished Austrian officers have repeatedly expressed themselves to the effect that the commander of the troops before Delhi " ought to have imitated the example of General Haynau." When the garrison of Temesvar was reduced to extremities, and was in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the Hungarians, Haynau suddenly quitted the fortross of Comorn, which he was investing, and marched his army to the relief of Temeavar. "Now, Lucknov," say the Austrians, " was in the same position as Temesvar, and might have been saved by a couip dc 7nain, although nothing could with such a smaU force be indertaken against Delhi." By the foregoing you see that no hope is now entertained here that the gallant garrison of the citadel at Lucknow wiU be able to hold out until assistance arrives. Yesterday the Oesterreichische Zeitung, the organ of the Finance Minister, contained a leader which was written for the purpose of removing the unpleasant impression produced by the article in the Oesterreichi-sche Corrcspondenz of the preceding day; but the financiers have lost courage, and are not likely to recover it until something has been done to relieve the money-market from the heavy burdens which have so injudiciously been heaped on it. The projects of the Minister of Finance were prematurely disclosed, and the Emperor was extremely angry that such was the case. The Board of the Gallician Railroad is resolved to make a call of 30 per cent., but some of the principal subscribers will refuse to make any payments, because the statutes of the contpany were altered by Government. The Minister of Finance is said not to know what measures to take in order to restore public confidence, and it is highly probable that such is the case, for the name of his non-official advisers is legion. It has more than once been hinted in my correspondence that several persons enjoy credit here who do not deserve it, and authentic information has to-day been acquired that a member of the board of a highly influential establishment has speculated so much beyond his means that he is unable to meet his engagements. At present names cannot be mentioned, but I shall probably be able to do so in a day or two. By its new commercial treaty with France Russia has inflicted a heavy blow on its protAgi, Greece. Formerly the Greek wines introduced into Russia paid about 50 per cent. less than the French, oUt, as the duty is now almost the same on both, few perEons will continue to drink the produce of the vines of the islands of Scopelos, Skiathos, Mykene, Santorin, Naxos, &c. The Greek skippers are also of opinion that they will soon lose a great part of the Southern Russia corn trade, as the ships of France now enjoy the same privileges as those of Greece in all the Russian ports. According to the well-informed Pera correspondent of the Triester Zeitu'wn, Lord Stratford has informed the Porte that vast quantities of weapons are bought up by the ultra-Mahomedan party for the use of their fellowbelievers in India. The correspondent asserts that the substance of the reply given by the Grand Vizier to his Lordship was, that he could not possibly interfere with any private speculation which was prejudicial neither to the existence nor to the welfare of Turkey. If the Austrian papers are to be believed, Baron Prokesch is now doing all in his power to persuada the Porte to sanction the firman by which the Viceroy of Egypt authorized M. de Lesseps to form a canal across the Isthmus of Suez. Ishatn Bey, the Turkish diplomatist who signed the "preliminaries of peace" here orn the 1st of February, 1850, is now in Vienna, on his way to Berlin, where he will reside as the Representative of Turkey at the Piissian Court. Information has just been given me that the Emperors Alexander and Francis Joseph have agreed to reduce their armies. The vintage in Austria is likely to be first-rate both as to quality and quantity. The Ancona correspondent of the Augsburg Gazette writes that Austria is likely to have granted to her by the Papal Government the right "always" to keep a small garrison in Ancona. It is not probable that the news is correct, but, if it should be s., neither France nor England will greatly approve the arrangement between Austria and Rome. According to advices from Bagdad, the English Commissaries, who were accompanied by a Persiaa employf, have been received at Herat with all tha ceremony and respect due to them. Captain Bulwer, who was attached to the British Commissioner at Bucharest, arrived here yesterday, and will leave this evening for Trieste, on his way to Alexandria and India. The Vienna Gazctte of this evening contains the following despatch:- ' LINZ, Ocr. 3. "1 His Mlajesty the Emperor passed through this city a; 11 o'clock this morning, on his way to Ischl." About an hour and a half earlier the Empre3s was at Euleinmiluchen, which is the first post-station beyond Linz. ITALY. (FROM OUOR OWN COFRRBSPO1Tx)NT.) TURIN, Ocr. 3. At the end of last week and beginning of this the whole of this part of the country was visited by heavy rains, of the effects of which we are now receiving daily accounts from different -iuarters. In several places the inundations had done considerable damage to both dwellings and highways, while the watery element had much retarded the vintage, as grapes gathered in such weather would be quite unfit to make wine, and so the farmers have been obliged to postpone that harvest until the fruit is well dried again by a warm sun, which has most happily succeeded to the late rains. Neither rice nor Indian corn has suffered by the rains, fortunately; and both those crops ape being rapidly carried throughout the north of Italy. The chestnut trees are covered with fruit on the Appennines, and the olive, in theLigurianprovinces, is said to be free from all disease; and, at the same time, the crop of pears and apples now being gathered is reported as being as abundant and good as it promised aL the summer. Theinjuryto thehighways fromthe floods brought down from the mountains lately has been more felt in other parts of Italy than in Piedmont, but here the river Stura has carried away the embankment of a railway-bridge, and very much impeded the direct comnunication between Turin and Novara. It is promised, however, that this inconvenience sball be remedied in a few days, and on the 12th of this month the extension of the Turin and Novara Railway from Novara to the Lombard frontier will be opened to the public, which will, if the administration of the line be well conducted, shorten the time necessary for a journey from Turin to Milan to seven or eight hours; and it appears that on the same day the railway from Milan to Venice is to be opened throughout, thereby reducing the time required for travelling from one of those towns to the other to seven hours, so that, with proper combinations on the part of coach proprietors and railway managers (a consummation rarely occurrinrg in those regions, unhappily), it should only be a sumrmer day'a jourmey from the foot of the Alps at Sisa to Venice after the 12th of this month; and, Hf we may credit the oft-told tale, now repeated by the Milanese journals, of the Austrian Government having consented to the completion of the railway works in the direction of the Piedmontese frontier, even that time will be further reduced two or three hours in another twelvemonth. At the same time that they annoaunce this important decision on the part of the Austrian Government, the Milan papers state thit greater facilities will in future be afforded to Austrian subjects owning property in Piedmont for obtaining passports to cross the frontier; so that, on the completion of the railway from Novara to Milan, these " mixeed subjects" will be given a passport within two hours after their application; and in a couple of hours more, says the Bco della Bersa, they may reach their propertiea at 50 kilometres from Milan. 'What makes these reports more credible at the present moment is, that the Austrian Government has undoubtedly been in a conciliatory mood towards its Lombard subjects of late in everything saving the fatal matter of taxation. The passport system has been sensibly relaxed towards all travellers in the Austrian States, more especially so towards foreigners, who are now less bothered about passports in the Austrian dominions than in any other continental country, perhaps; end cseveral nominations lately made by the new GovernorGeneral, the Archduke Ferdinand, show a decided inclination to win over persons from the opposite ranks by baits and sops instead of the old style of coercion. How long this new practice will last, and whether sufficiently long to admit of the railway eommunication being eoinpleted to the westward without further interruption, is not easily foreseen. The reconciliation of the Courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna-if it takes place in truth-is likely to lead to a change of Minis'ry in Austria, it is said; and if the Emperor Francis Joseph should choose his next advisers from among those who entertain the same idea towards Lombardy and Piedmont as the military chiefs, Counts, Gyulai and Grunne, there is only too much reason to fear the present conciliatory policy will be but of short duration and barren of any good result. lVhether reasonably or not, the fact of the Emperor of Austria having worn a Russian uniform on the occasion of his meeting the Czar the other day is much commented on by politicians here, who seem to think that if the Emperor Francis Joseph bad not resolved to swallow any amount of dirt to obtain forgiveness from his bigger brother he would never have donned his livery after all that has passed between them during the last few years. A letter from Ravenna mentions a fact worthy of observation, after the denials given by the ultra-Papists, as to the existence of a Liberal party among the wealthy classes of the Legations. It became necessary the other day for the municipality of Ravenna to send in three names for the Government to choose a Gonfaloniere from, the present occupant of that office having completed his term of service, and the gentlemen who were chosen by their fellow-citizens for this honour were Counts Gamba, Pasolini, and Cusare Rasponi, all men of undoubted respectability and known constitutional principles. At the same time the letter adds, the persons chosen for the offices of Assistant-Gonfalonieri were all of them subscribers to the address presented to the Pope last summer. The Opinione of Turin says:- "The police of Milan have senta circular to all the frontier offices recommending them to exercise tte greatest vigUance over persons crossing the frontier, and to search their persons, in order to prevent the introduction of printed papers and lithographed drawings offensive to the Archduke Maximilian." SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 1st are filled with speculations respecting the Ministerial crisis. The Epoca and the Noredades say that the Queen has consented to have Count de Mirasol nominated Captain-General of Cuba, in the room of General de la Concha, but that Her Majesty had not signed the nommation. One of the papers says that'it is not improbable that General Lersundi wfill resign his seat in the Cabinet, and tnat the Duke of Valencia and M. Pidal will reconstruct a new Ministry; but the Espana declares that all the Ministers intend to stand or fall together. An extensive nomination of Senators is spoken of, and some of the gentleme 1 indicated belong to the Progresista party. Thi Queen had appointed the Marquis PidaI to be Pre- sident of the Academy of Moral and Politica' Sciences, the establishment of which has just been decreed; Her Majesty had also nominated 18 of the 36 members of which the Academy is to onaist,
ATrrEznrn MURDEF. A.D SUICIDE AT DOR.- On Monday morning week, at about 1 o'clock, a man named Frederick Bushell attemkpted to take the life of his wife by cutting her throat, buxt failing he then att-empted to commit suicide. They lived in Hartley.street, near the °Mtaryroad. On londay morning the police-officers on night duty were surprised by repeated ringing at the door. On answering the Summons they found it was rsf BusheU in her chemise, nearly exhausted from loss of blood, which -was flowing in a stream from a dreadful ash in her throat. From her state-ment, the police gathereldthat her husband had in a fit of passion attempted to mnurder her, but tbhab after a severe struggle with him she had managed. to escape from the house. Sbe also stated that hrhusa,~nd h,ad threatened to take away his own life. 'Upon this Policesergeant Geddes went immediately to Hartlsystret, and going to Bushell's residence he found hirm struggling with , policemAn (who had been on duty near the spot) for the possessmion of a razor, with which he had already in'fieted two or three cets on his own tbroat. The two saoceeded in wrenching the razor from his grasp,and he was taken into custody. Both be and his wrife were oonveyed to the hospital, ad it is hoped that Mrs. Bshell will recover, but no apprehenisions are entertained for his safety, as neithe' of the cuts inflicted on himself are danerous.-Sout Crn .aUc
TlHB INDIAN MUTINIES. THE MASSACRE AT OAWWPnPR. The followFing affecting letters were received from a lady at Cawnpore, and wilI be interesting as containinug the latest newrs up to the time of their entering Sir Hugh Wheeler'e intrenchment: "Caw-pore, -May 27. "Dearest F.,-It is not yet the mall day, nor wiU be for some days, but I am induced to write while the d .k is open to Calcutta. and we are still able to communicate, lest fresh difficulties should encompass us, and you should be Iset without a notion of the events of these days. It Is a sad history. We are living in awful realities, and we cannot see the end of them. We were apparently safe and quiet here till the 21st, when the 2d Cavalry began to show symptoms of uneasiness, and intelligence was given that a ridng of the native troops was in contemplation that night. Mr. H-, the magistrate and collector, brought his wife and children in to us in the afternoon, and we agreed aU to remain together. Up to this time, no suspicion having been entertained of the troops' loyalty, no preparations for defence had been made. Now, however, all were astir. The General (Sir Hugh Wheeler) telegraphed to Lucknow for succour, the European barrack at the depOt was assigned as a rendezvous, and some families went there for safety. We, however, determined to remain at our house until further alarm were given; but Colonel E- said he would go and sleep in the midst of his men to show that Ihe had confidence in them ; to we had only Mr. H - to stay with us, Presently, about 11 o'clock at night, he was called away to make some arrangement, so we thought it scarcely sight to remain here alone. Accordingly we took our little unconscious children out of their beds, and with the ayahs off we set in the carriage to the European barracks. There we found a number of refugees in a state of great alarm of course, but for the most part composed and resigned. It was a night of fearful suspense, yet it passed away without any disturbance, and I had the bappiness of seeing my husband in the morning alive and well, snd we went back to our house for the day. The danger had been imminent, but the posting of six guns in front of our barraeks, the state of preparation we were getting into, and the move of the offioers (at least of two) to sleep among their men seemed to have checked the ardour of the mutinously disposed, and they put off, without abandoning, their evil design. The next day (Friday) was one full of agony and dread; and thenight was more than poor human nature, unassisted, could endnre. When my husband left me that night to go to his post I never expected to see him alive again, for some of his men had been overheard wildly talking of mutiny and murder, and had made a proposal to destroy their officers ! Colonel E- himself had fully made up his mind that a deathstroke would be given, yet he fiinched not an instant in the performanee of his duty, I am happy to say. We were pre. sErved for that night again. I could scarcely believe that my husband's voice sounded outside the tent (for we had now arranred for a tent just outside the barrack for our. selves). After that miserable night the Saturday following seemed like heaven, for we went to our house and spent the day quietly there-at least with such quietness as was possible with the maost terrible rumours coming in throughout the day and reviving all our saddest apprehensions. Of course we returned to the depOt at night, and for the first time since our move exhausted nature would be attended to, and I fell asleep for some hours, and for a time shut out aU the horrid realities of our situation. All Sunday was pretty quiet. The Bede came off that day and the next, when it was expected that an outbreak would occur. Tt did not so, however, and on Monday morning our minds were somewhat reassured by all the Mussulmaa of the 1st Regiment coming in a body according to custom to salaam to Colonel B- after their prayers, and they expressed their intentions of fidelity, &c., al of which are very well, but not to be depended on now-a-days. We returned to those melancholy nightquarters; oh! such a scene. Men, officers, women, and ohildren, beds, and chairs, all mingled together Inside and outside the barrack; some talking or even laughing, some very frightened, some defiant, others despairing. Three guns in front of our position and three behind, and a trench in course of formation all round. Such sickening sights these for peaceful women, and the miserable reflec. tion that aU this ghastly show is caused not by open foes, but by the treachery of those we have fed and pampered and honoured and trasted in for so many years. Oh ! I cannot dweU upon the harrowing thoughts, I must pass on toevents. News came in of the 9thNative Infantryhaving turned, Allyghur and its treasury faling Into their hanus, Mynpoorie stiU held against the rebels by the collector and his police, but R-tawah gone, and the insurgents on their way here. Now we believed our crisis had arrived. The appearance of succeEsful insurgents amongst the regiments would be the signal to rise, and all we could really depend upon for defence were our position behind our guns and the help of abont 150 European soldiers, 40 railway people and merchants, and a few stragglers. There are two regiment3 of Oade Irregulars, but I am not inclined to pu' faith in them. There are also some Mahrattas vwth the Rajah of Bithoor who have come to our assistance, but I cLan scarcely feel a comfort at their presence either. The night passed off quietly, however, and the insurgents have not yet arrived. We are in our house. About 45 more Europeans are expected to-day and two guns, with seven European artilerymen. A regiment of Europeantinfantry is to oome up with all speed from Calcutta, but some time must elapse ere it can arrive. The General is busy now, and he spiked the guns he could not use yesterday, and laid a train for blow. ing up the magazine, should an outbreak occur. We aro getting provisions into our position and making preparations in the event of being shut up there altogether. The news from Delhi makes us very anxious, for any di3aster there will be fatal to us here, and India must for a time at least be lost. I need not dilate upon this terrible state of things, it teUs its own tale too truly. The spirit of revolt pervades the Bengal army, and it remains to be seen whether we are strong enough to put it down, or whether we must suconub to the storm. Our only chanoe here is to keep things quiet until reinforcementsocanarrive. Icannot conceal from myself that my husband is likely to be the first to fall. He says if his regiment mutinies it may walk over his body, but he wil never leave it. " For ourselves I need only say, that even should our position be strong enough to hold out, there is the dreadful exposure to the heat of May and June, together with the privations and confinement of besieged sufferers to render it very unlikely that we can survive the disasters which may fall upon us any day, any hour. lam going to despatoh this to Calcutta to be sent through our agents there, that you may know our situation. My dear littlebchild is looking very delicate; my prayer is that she may be spared much saffering. The bitterness of death has been tzsted by us many, many times during the last fortnight, and should the reality come, I hope we may find strength to meet it with a truly Christian courage. It is not bhard to die oneself, but to see a dear child suffer and perish, that is the hard, the bitter trial, and the cup which I must drink, should God not deem it fit that it should pass from me. My companion Mrs. H-, is delightful; poor young thing, she ha3 such a gentle spirit, so unmurmuring, so desirous to meet the trial rightly, so unselfish and sweet in every way. Eer husband is an exceUlent man, and of cotuse very much ex. posed to danger, almost as much as mine. She has two children, and we feel that our duty to our little ones demands that we should exert ourselves to keop up health and spirits as much as possible. There is a reverse to this sad picture. Delhi may be retaken in a short time. Aid may come to us and aU may subside into tranquility once more. Let us hope for the best, do our duty and trnst in God above all things. Should I be spared I wilU write to you by the latest date. As long as we can live in our house during the day, we suffer but little comparatively, but we may be shut up at any time. We must not give way to despondency, for at the worst we know that we are in God's hands, and TIe does not for an instant forsake us. He will be with us in the valley of the shadow of death also, and we need fear no eviL God bless you I " Cawpore, st June, 1857. "For the cbance of this reaching you, I send a few lines via Bom'bay that you may have the latest news of us. The revolt has spread since I wrote last. Etawah, Allyghur, and Muttra and Bolundsbawur have all been plundered, and yesterday came news of a serious cmeute at Lucknow, the worst thing that could have happened for us, as it seems almost impossible that disturbances so near should not create a commotion amongst the troops here. The Commander-in-Chief has disappointod all expectation . his delays may lose India. It was eesential that a blow should be struck at Delhi on the instant. There he is awaiting the arrival of a battering train from Philoor, and does not expect to be before Delhi till the 9th, Scarcely anything short of a miracle can keep people quiet for s, many days, and the insurgents are meanwhile strengthening themselves and collecting In large numbers, and of course gaining confidence from our lamentable weakness. We want a Napier now, not a cautious'calculating speculator. It is very sad, but we cannot do anything, Oar weak position here, with a mere handful of Europeans, placec u3 in very great danger, and daily and hourly we are looking for disasters. It is supposed that the oommsandants here have shown wonderful tact, and that their measure of boldly facing the danger by going out to sleep amongst their men has had a wonderful effect in restraining them. But ererybody knows that this cannot last. Any acecidental spirk may set the whole of the three regimnents of infantry and one of cavalry in a blaze of mutiny; and ever if we kcep our position vbere we are entrenched, with six guns, officers must be sacrificed; and I do not attempt to conoeal from myself that my husband runs greater risk than any one of the vbole force. " Europeans are almost daily arriving from Calcutta, but in small numbers-20 and 30 at a time. We have now about 300, I believe. Every day that we escape free of disturbance adds to our strength, and gives a botter chance for our lives. Property is not to be thought of, as conflagrxtions always accompany the outbreaks, and we may be quite sure of our bangalows being burnt down directly troubles commence. All have gone at Lucknow, they say. We bave hitherto been very fortunate in spending our days at home. It is at some risk that we leave the entrenchments, but there would be risk also in encountering the fearful heat, so we prefer ruanning the chance of a surprise to the certainty of great suffering for our children and ourselves in tents at this hottest season. The barrack is fearfully crowded, so we should be no better off there. Yoa will scarcely be able to realize the fearful state we are in. we can scarcely do so ourselves. No onecan saybow or where the trouble is to end. Mrs. H- is a sweet companion in affliction; we shall stick close to each other as long as it pleases God to spare us. Last night, after much fatigue, of mental torture and several nights of imperfect rest, I fell quite into a state of stupefaction. Body and mind alike refused to be longer active; it was neoe5sary-just nature asserting her rights to restore the exhausted powers. And there 'was my child, so restless I and Mrs. H- took her and walked about with her, and soothed the little thing, that I might not be disturbod. I believe we shall be some support to one another under every trial. Oar English letters came in a day or two ago, one from you up to April 14. I canaot reply further to it now; in the presence of these awful realities little else can be thought of. Such nights of *nirety I would never have believed possible, and the days are full of excitement. Every note and every me6sage come pregnant with events and alarms. Another fortnight we expect will decids our fate, and, wbatever it may be, I trust we shall be enabled to bear it. It is sapposed that the Lucknow mutineers have gone towards Delhi General Anson must meet the increased band of rebels as well as he may. May we be preserved from the evils that the incapacity of our leaders naturally entails ! If these are my last words to you, you will remember them lovingly, and always bear in mind that your affection and the love we have ever had for each other is an Ingredient of comfort in these bitter times." DELrI. The following is from an officer in the camp before Delhil- " Camp before Delhi, July 27. "Where the two roads to Kurnaul meet the enemy took up their first position, at a place called Badlee-ke-Serai, with sandbag batteries and about 16 guns, some of them 24pounders, and eight how itzers. We came on them on the 8th of June, and got a tremendous pounding for about halfan hour, till we stormed them with the bayonet, when the mutineers 'ded. They are good behind guns, but poor creatures at close quarters. "We then advanced unmolested, and took our position on a commanding ridge, the nearest point of which is about 1,200 yards from the Moree-gate, pitching our camp on the parade ground of the old oantonment, which is just out of reach of their shells. Our force was about 3,000 strong, and the pickets being more than 1,000 stege operations were out of the question. Only an assault remained; but General Barnard could not make up his mind to amsent to it, and so we waited for reinforcements, and are now about 6,000 strong. But our guns are still in number and calibre quite unequal to a siege. We have two 24-pounders (captured), six 8-inch howitzers, nine 18-pounders, and six 8-inch mortars. The enemy have an enormous arsenal, with 32-pounders, 24-pounders, 10-inch howitzers in abundance, and are limited only in artillerymen; and our troops are so worked that working parties cannot be procured. Taylor, at present second in command of Engineers, when he came and succeeded Laughton (who was immediately sent away), recommended an assault. We were then about 5,500 strong. The General agreed. We were to escalade at the Cashmere and Moria bastions, and to blow in the Mores and Cashmere gatea The thing was arranged in detail for the 2d of July, but at the last moment old Sir H. Barnard held back. Baird Smith, who joined next day as Chief Engineer, urged it; but the next week we lost 450 men from skirmishes and about 100 from cholera, and then Smith acknowledged that the thing was too hazardous to be tried, for there ar at least 15,000 or 20,000 men inside, and the city is enormous. Our present plan is therefore to hold our present position until reinforcomenta arrive from down country and the Punjab, and a proper siege train, and then to commence a vigorous siege on the fron t between the Moria and Cashmere bastions. We shall have our first parallel about Ludlow Castle, and the place wil probably fall in about five days, for the enceinte is very simple. The fort will give no trouble. The left of the ridge (our left) is bare and open, and, as the enemy used to occupy the broken ground in Metcalfe Park aud annoy us, we have taken possession of it, and our advanced pickat occupies the stables on the bank of the river. " The right of the ridge from lindoo Raos to the Grand Trunk-road is very rocky and covered with thick wood, and its base is a dense mass of gardens and enclosures. Here have been almostall our fights. Our troups have been about 203times engaged, sometimes very hotly. At first Hindoco Raos house was our extreme right, and almost every day the enemy used to cross up the ravines on every side and attack the batteries there. There was, of courso, only one result, but in driving them out of the Subzemundee, and from our men not understanding light Infantry work, we used to suffir heavily. But our retribution was tremendous; whenever our troops caught any of them in any of the gardens without their having time to bolt, they used to bayonet them to a man, and sometimes in this way 300 or 400 dead bod.es have been counted round the position after cne of these skirmishes. " Now that our force has been augmented we have taken possession of the Subzemundee, aud strongly fortified the Serai. We have also placed a strong picket in and fortified the Pagoda down the hIll, and have made snug breachwork right round the hills. Our men are now so well protected and their position altogether so improved that the mutineers have quite lost heart, and their attacks are becoming feeble in the extreme now. Our only heavy loss arose from the impetuosity of our officers, who pursued the enemy on one or two occasions right through Kissengunge to rhe open ground in front of the city, and so lost a number of men by grape from the walls. It has been hot fighting altogether-our Adjutant-General killed, his successor and the Quartermaster-General both severely wounded; the Guides, with a complement of four officers, have had one killed and nine wounded. The gallant little Ghoorkas are reduced from 440 to 216. Not a regiment of Europeans is more than 450 stroDg. Two generals have died. We have had one engineer killed, three wounded, one dead from cholera, and tro lnvalided. On the whole the troops have stood the exposure wonderfully, but there has been a great deal of choler. Every Bengal regiment is gone or is going. In some cases they have allowed their officers to escape; in others they have murdered every soul. But retribution, let us hope, is coming. The Sikhs are faithful, and are being enlisted in numbers. Those here with us and the Ghoorkas have fought nobly." DINAPORE. The following is an extract from a letter dated Dinapore, Aug. 1S:- " In my letter of the 2d I gave you the particulars, as nearly as I could at the time, of the unfortunate affair at Arrah. I am now able to state correctly that we had 47 killed and 31 wounded, but since then, I am happy to in. form you, the 10th have had a glorious revenge. A detach- ment of only 200, composed of the men of the Grenadiers and No. 6 company, left this about a week ago, commanded by Captain Patterson, a first-rate officer, and with great caution proceeded tbrough a dense jungle in the direction of a place called Ju,gdeespore, where the rebel Sepoys had rallied after the thrashing Major Eyre gave them at Arrah. The Rajah of Jugdeespore had joined the Dinapore mutineers with a large fore, and had placed several guns in position. A despatch camo in here yesterday from the major, announcing that the pLaco had been taken, and the muti. neers completely routod. The official despatch says the bebaviour of the men of the 10th ws beyond all praise, and that they fought like 'demons.' The barbarous cruelties inflicted upon theircomrades at Arrah being so fresh in their recollection, it was almost impossible to restrain. them, Major Eyre writes that nothing could exceed their ragethat they rushed upon the Sepoys, and for nearly two hours fought hand to hand with ton times their number, killing 400 of them, and taking three of &oomuer Sing's guns in great style, I knew the gallant 10th would do wonders when they got a chanoe, and they have given proof of that now, for it appears the Sepoys opposed to our little band of 200 at Jugdeespore oxceeded the number that escaped from Dinaporo. This smart affair willbe most gratifyingto Colonel Franks, than whom there in not a braver and more discreet offiosr in the whole army, He will be savage when he hear3 of the loss his regiment sustained by suoh bad management at Arrah. Had he been here that event never would have bappened, becauns, I am satisfied that he would have disarmed the 7th, 8h, and 40th Regimsnt*, and taken tho responsiblity upon his own shoulders. We wat such men as Colonel Franks here, I am glad he is cowing out. He will be sure to be appointed to a oommand. " Major Eyre writes in high terms of Captain Patteon and our other officers, and has lso brought into prominan~ notice the galant conduct of some our oolour-sergesud.. Our men served tho Sepoys after their faehlon towards bur unfortunate men at Arrah, for they hung up the wounded and the bodies of the killed upon trees along the road4-a mile and -hbalf,-and then prooeeded on towards the Palfce of the Rajah, where they found about 50 more of the scoundrels concealed, the whole of whom were shot down by the 10th men, who hung tho bodies of the Sepoys with their own blue shirts over the walls, and left them to wither in the sun. In this palace (if it could bs called one) two boxes of rupoes were found, each contalinng about 4,000. The whole were divided among the men, who afterwardi burnt the palace to the ground, as well as all the villages, in its vicinity, and killed a number of the people belonging to this Koomer Sing. The detachment is expected hack tomorrow. In this afr-r none of the Ith were killed-only a few wounded. " I wrote you on thel5th, vi4 Calcutta, but, being anxiou; to inform you of our saccess, I aend this at a venture, vid Bombay, and hope it may reach you. It is just poaible that the officil despatch may not arrive before this letter." MMZAPORE The following is from a gentleman in the Civil Service, dated Mirzapore, Aug. 14:- " Our entrenchments are now completed. I send you a rough plan, upon no sort of scale, but It will give you some idea of our position. We at present muster 135 souals, with provisions for a month, and all are told off to our respective posts. We have just had another gun sent us (also a 6-pounder), makinz two, with 500 rounds of ammunition, and we have bagged two small guns (native) from the city, which carry a ball of about LANb. I fear we shali not get any more troops, although It is reported we are to have to morrow 180 more Europeans from Benares. The Dinapore mutineers are stated to-day to be at Almora, 6 miles from this. It is my opinion they will not venturo here at all, their object being to get to Delhi vid Calpee; but, reinforced as we expect to be to-morrow, we can go out and meet them. Pity we have not a few artiUlerymen. I do not think I exaggerate when 1 say that the North.West Provinces and a part of Bengal are lost. We shall want 60,000 men (Europeans) to reconquer it. It is to be hoped there will be no doubts expressed.in England as to this fact, and act speedily. "It will be a startling thinR for the English people to learn that the finest possession under the Crown is virtually out of their grasp. But let them consider, and they will admit that it is their own fault; and when they remember that they have held a territory as large as Europe with some 24,000 men, at the same time maintaining an army of 100,000 natives, armed with the best weapons England could give them, and disciplined by English officers, they w1l cease to wonder at what has happened, and marvel that it has not occurred before; but I think I see in this revolution the beginning of the end. Before six months have passed over us the natives of Indilawill have learnt that buta very small atom of the power of England has been displayed in India, and when this country is overrun with European troops they will find that the last days of their prejudices have begun. " The few Europeans that up to this time have remained in India have been gradually and almost imperceptibly, by their example, working new convictions in the minds of the natives. It is not very difficult to predict the result when the number of Europeans is trebled. The natives, who are now in the ascendancy, know that they have but little time to lose, and I believe that one reason for their blood. thirstiness is tho knowledge that they cannot finally be successfuL In sx months the Hindoos will have learnt that the Mahomedans are nob gentle masters, and they will be gld to assist a people under whose rule they are sure of advantages and good faith, which under a Mlussulman Government they can never hope to obtain. They have been so long under our I government that they have forgotten what the state of their forefathers ras under the Moguls. Six months, as I have said before, will be sufficient to determine their choice, and there is no fear what the result wil be. I do not suppose that the papers would agree with me as to our state out here, but the editors ar not on the spot; they do not know everything that goes on, and everything which (to any one who observes) points ou5 the way the stream is running; they do not see the faces of 1he people,-they do not see the faces of theMussulmans, how they brighten when they hear of our reverses; they do not tee or hear the vilagers when they refuse to pay their revenue proclaim the 'Augreez Baj"* to be at au end. They do not see or hear all this, but those who are in constant and daily communication with the natives, who pass them and hear their talk,-those persons know that what I say is true. I have had myself four or five cases in which the prisoner has made public his opinion about our govern. mont being ended. If I had my way I would have hung those men, as they were our subjects and guilty of treason. The dawk- both going and coming,is so very uncertain that this is the last day (14th of August) I can venture to keep this letter. I still think we shall have no attack on our position. After the Dinapore mutineers are gone we have but few native troops in this direction; besides which itis about high time for the mutineers to be fighting among themselves. All Behar is in insurrection. Is it not wonderful how the Sikhs are sticking to us? It has been the saving of us here. Indeed, if the Sikh regiment who held the fort of Allahaabaa when the 6th mutinied, and for three weeks after, had mutinied also, the whole of this part of India would have been in the hands of the rebels. I think they deserve any. thing that can be done for them. To be sure, they only do their duty, but where eo many have failed those vwho ' stand firm' shine out all the more brilliantly by contrast. " I am sure I wish the Sikhs had never been taken away from this piace; we should have been 'all serene' then and cared for * nobody."' The following is from an officer of rank "Calcutta, Aug. 23. "We arrived on the 13th and found Lord Elgin and General Grant here. Grantwent back to hladrasto-day; Lord Elgin goes to China by next steamer. All well here, and no fear but we shall soon see Jack Sepoy put down. Good news from Delhi, Agra, Cawnpore, Allahabad, and Benares. Delhi will faU when we get a siege train there ; only 12,000 Sepoys left in that city, we hear. The tide is turning in our favour everywhere. I have got command of a Sikh regiment, and leave for the Upper Provinces as soon as a steamer starts. Grant wanted me to command the Volunteer Yeomanry European Irregular Cavalry nowvraising, but I want to get up country quick, and R- has taken the Yeomanry, only 160 strong at present, and to be (300. "M My jolly Sikhs are at present scattered, some at Rancegunge, some at Allahabad, &c.; but I am to collect and organize them on my way to Delhi with a brigade vwhich leaves this in a few days.

I have advised that the disarmed regiments should all be sent to Saugor Island and kept there till they volunteer for China. One war steamer would guard them ail at Saugor Isand, and they could have rice to live upon, and shoot the tigers with greased cartridges. The Lucknow olks hold out well, aud will, we trust, eo relieved very soon. The iohurruni is in full swing, and guards and guns are placed in all important situations; but there will be no row, I think-, and if there is the Mussulmans will get a sound drubbing.

MURDERS BY A MANLAc.-The Inverness Circuit Court was opened on Wednesday, the Lord Justice Clerk prsEiding, when Angus Macphee, Liniolate, in the island of 3enbeoula, vas brought up on the chlarge of having murdeted Mary Mlacphee, hi8 aunt, Angus Macphee, his father nud Catherine Macinnes, his mother, all of whom were pereons of an advanced age. The cirvumstaiices of this painful case will be fresh iu tho recollection of tho public.

e STATISTICS OF E'RECKIS. 7-~ The following is a synopsis of the wrecks and easnialties which have taken place during the past year on the coast and in the seas of the British Isles. The Register, which is accompanied by an engraved coloured chart, distinguishing the site of each casualty, was presented to IParliament by tne Board of Trade, and a more complete and initeresting documient has never been published "In the year lSoO the first ;VreeX Rqlietcr in this country was published. It was compiled, we believe, at the suggestion of Captain Washington, R.N., the present Hydro. grapher of the Admiralty. The startliDg facts which the Begister has in each saccessive year since disclosed have awakened general attention, have several tiiiie, been discussed in both Houses of Parliament, and have resulted in the establishment on our coast of a system of lifeboats for the preservation of the lives of unfortunate shipwrecked individuals that has never had a parallel in this or any other conntry. in this philanthropic work, in which the Itoyal National Lifeboat Institution has taken so prominent a part, much remains stUI to be done; and, if we expound correctly the views of the committee of managemiient of that institution, we believe that it is their fixed determination, if aided by the support of the public, to leave no exposed point on our dangerous coast unprovided with an efficient lifeboat establishmnent. " The follwing list gives some details of the work of destruction during the past five years:- ' Who can contemplate these lamentable details without seeing the great necessity for continued exertions and precautionary measures in respect to the preservation of life and property ? The same, too, must be pursued with untiring energy until the average loss of life and property is reduced to the minzmum attainable by human skill. The number of casualties in each month of 18cb are thus niven in the Reaiisfer for that yar *_ " We arrive at the conclusion froma these facts that our coasting trade, and our coal trade in particular, is the most dangerous and yields one-third of the whole losses or col lisions. Indeed, it is useless to disguise the fact that some of our coasting vessels are a disgrace to us as a nation. Only a few months ago a small schooner fromn Sandwich, while riding off Bridlington, was so rotten that her anchor pulled ont her bows, causing her of course to sink, and her unfortunate crew of four hands to perish. And again, on the 8th of May last, a small schooner known to be unseaworthy (as vwo are informed) went to pieces off Aberdovey, on the coast of Wales, before there was time for any aid to reach the crew. May we not presume that rigid inquiry would discover many other similar cases among the numerous details of the Zk.giser, even in addition to the large nutmber stated to have been abandoned or have foundered from unseaworthiness ? Surely a remedy night be found for such a disgraceful state of things. "' An analysis of the tonnage of the wrecks on our shores during tho past year further tends to prove our statement. It is as follows:- Vessels underMtous t .145 st aud underjes tons. 338 101 anI under aCo tvuas .472 3 51 and under 600 tons .. .. .. .. .. 137 fOI and under 9 o tons .4 901 and ur3er, 1.2Q0 tons .5 L2Q anud uward 12 "The exaot site of each disaster is given in the ?cyisicr and to prevent thoipossibility of error on this point, the wreck chart, which accompanies it, clearly and distinctly points out the locality of the wreck. What a tale of woe and misery this death chart brings to light; who can think of it without feeling a desire, by every means in his power, to lessen the causes of those black dots on it ? The following is the summary:- East Coast-Dungenega to Portland Fritlh .. West Coast-Land6s-enud to(Geenock .. . . 307 South Coamt-Laudsaead to Dungeses . 119 IriehCoat ...155 Sc;IIy Wands 2.. . Luoy Island. ... 11 Ille of M .. Northern Isles. Orkney, &c. " We believe that after this additional evidence a propo sition wvill be subniitted to Parliament in the early part of next session to build a harbour of refuge on the north-east coat of Scotland, another onthe north-east coastof England, and a third on the west coast of England. "The return distinguishes the force of the wind at the time of each disaster, which is instructive so faras it proves that it is not the storm or the hurricane that destroys tbe I largest vumber of vessels, and that more danger is to be dreaded from the carelessness, neglect, or incomupetence of man than from the act of God. " The following table gives a list of the wrecks and casualties, excluding coUisions, which have involved total loss, distinguishing the cause of loss :-Stress of weather, 148 - abandoned from unseaworthiness, 17 ; foundered from unsaaworthiness, 37 ; want of lights or buoys on coasts or shoals, 10; mistaking lights or bearings, 10; fog or current, 3i; defective compsases, 5 ; defective charts. 3; error in coarse of reckoning, 6 ; error in judgiiient, 12 ; ignorance of coast, 3 ; errors of pilots, 7; want of pilot, 3 ; neglect of the lead, 21; want of caution l1 - intemperance, 2 ; general negligence, 9; missing stays, 10; striking on sunken wrecks 1; burnt, 4; capsized or sunk, 4; cause unknown, 7; " Thus we find that no less than 2 0 ships were totally iost or stranded in 1856 from errors, unseamnashiD, or drunkenness, or other preventible causes, in addition to those from stress of weather. The lives lost from these disa-ters is not given; but the widows and the orphans of soie of these unfortunate crews in our seaports are too nuimerouis to eludle our observartion. If one out of every nine ships is lost from inefliciency whos0 duty shonld it he to see that crews are fuily equal to their duties? We have often contended that every English ship before leaving port should be subnmitted to inspection, in order that it might be certified that the ship is fully manned, and that means both simple and efficacious exist on board for the safety of the crew and passengers. " Wh'en considering thse above details, is it not a matter for serious reflection that there should have been Veasels. Abandoned from unsesworthbD . 17 Foundered from unse4wosrtbinese .. . .. 37 " Those 54 vessels lost from unseaworthiness form 5 per cent. of the whole casualties, or 17t1 per cent. of total losses. 'Whole crews are frequently sent to prison in th is enlightened country for refusing to go to sea in unscaworthy shiips; and now it is made clear that, out of 368 vessels totally lost in 1856, no less than 54 are officially affirmed on inquiry to be inseaworthy. But this is not the whole truth; we must add the vessels improperly found to that list, and there we see a little more of the mischief: Totallylosstorstrmndedfrxomdefectivecompasses 14 Ditto, from defectise charts..s. . Ditto, from improper stowage of anwhor i itrto, from conibustion or steam coai under batches and want of Peoser ventilators . 10 Dlitto, through leakage .? T?7 " A ship will leak at sea from straining, but the largo number of 87 vessels on our coast seems to be too great a percentage for such a casualty. A ship sent to sea with defectivee compasses or charts, and lost from that cause, ought to be olassed under the head of unseaworthy. * If all vessels were inspected by competent authorities before sailing, we suspect that the condemnation of existing vessels and equipment would be wholesale. We judge so from vanous reasons. In 180 the British tonnage was 4,232,!12 tons; we learn thattheships and steamers broken up in tbat year were 12!), registering 5.7( XO; tons. The vessels wrecked In 1850 were 6892. of 127.188 tons. But the new vessels registered were 6CS9, of 13:13695 tons, to which mieht be added the vessels buUt and sold for foreigners. The deaths from old age and infirmities were only 12'.) out of 3:.672. In December, 1885, the number of ships registered in the United Kingdomu from the Beard of Trade return was 2.,115, of 4,2zi, 908 tons, and the ships lost or damaged during theyear ending the 31st of December. 186f. were 884. of 151,470 ton.s, being 3-5 per cent. of locs. Foreign vessels are here excluded, so that we are still left in the dark as to the vessels broken up relatively to aggregate tonnage and loses. Fromn Lloyd's register of wrecks we gather that 1,959 vessels were lost in 185° ; this includes ships to distant ports not given in the Government return. Old vessels are made to do duty till they founder at sea. When a vessel is fit for nothing else she is put in the timber trade, and the fearful accounts we read of water-logged Ehips follow as a necessary sequel. " We thus, from the preceding considerations of definei causes, can oome to no other rational conclusion than that more ships are wrecked from oversight, ignoranuc, negleot, nd spurlous economy than from the dangers of the sea. Did we require more convincing demonstration of this attestation, we have hut to refer to the table which 'ves the force of the wind, and, as we have before remarked this is a highly intructive part of the paper before usthus:- Canu3tiie LIl3ht air and slight ateerzge wa Caul.s22 iglht breeze of one to two knots. 69 Gentle breeze of three to four knots 49 Mooerate breeze of five to Bix keots . 9 8 Fresh breeze, with royals .. . . . . 155 Strong breeze; sdngle reef and t;pZ";t sai , 140 Moderate galo; double reef and jib .. . 01 Fresh gale ; triple reefs ..n Strong zale; clmee reefsand torses ..3 .860 Wholegsale; close reefed maintopsaiand;eefedforeail 147 Storm : under storm astyasil..7 lsricane; bare polee 77 - This proves our Batemnt for,;out of 1,1iships, only 268 were lost in a whole gale, storm, or hurricane, and only 121 by the conjoint agency of the two latter. " We now a,pproach the most lamentable feature in these returns. Of the number of lives more or less lmperilled. we find them set down as 2,764. of whom 521 were drowned. Those saved by the mercy of God and the help of man were thus rescued:- By lifeboati of tho Royal Natioual Lifeboat Institu. tieo, and local bodiez ,.C2 By luegerl, Coastguard boats small craft, and ships' own boats. . .... . :_: 1,184 By th!pi and Etesmessesl. '407 From thnre, by lopes rockets, mortar `pParatus, ac. .. 26 Individual exsrtion of a meritWr:ots chbracter .. 28 " The facts clearly illustrate that great exertions are constantly being made by our lifeboat crews, boatmen, and fi-bermen, on the coast, to Eave life froru shipyreck, facts which should call forth the acknowledgtwebt of the comumunity at large, as stowing rOost satisfactorily what can be accomplished in this good work hy sustaiued and well* irected efforts. And surely an institutioni like that of the National Lifeboat Society, in addition to having granted rewards for rescuing 473 persons fron, shipwrecks, the lifeboats of which have been the means, during the past 12 months, of snatching 129 of our fellow-creatures from a watmiry grave, has only to make its clairas extensively known to be fuily appreciated snd liberally responded to by the afluent and humane throughout the land. " We thus appeal on behalf of the cause of humanity, but we ought not to be required to appeal to shipowners and underwriters to see that their ships are properly manned and furnished; for we believe that it is their best interest which is consulted in attending to that mani. sedul ty."
INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Although mytwo letters have been honoured with frequent public notice, exception has been taken only to two of the recommendations contained in them. It has been objected, first, that railroads cannot be depended upon for the rapid concentration of troops, because they are liable to be broken up by the enemy; and, secondly, that a properly organized police would be a Sepoy army under another name, which might rise against us as the last did. In a foreign war which is not combined with domestic disturbance railroads may, of course, be used at least as far as the frontier. In intestine commotions railway communication might, no doubt, be seriously interrupted if the disturbances commenced at once in every part of the country; but what usually happens is that mutiny or popular insurrection breaks out first at a particular place, where a rallying point is established and an example I is set of successful resistance to the Government. In such cases obsta prinwipiis is everything. A small force promptly applied will do what a much larger one, brought into the field at a later period, could not accornplish; and the incalculable evils arising from delay will be avoided. If the Vellore mutiny had been dealt with like the one whiclilately broke out at Meerut the whole Madras army wouild soon have been in a blaze. If there bad been a railway between Meerut and Delhi, with the Meerut terminus under the protection of the European troops, the native mutineers could hardly have injured the road enough in a single night to prevent a Enropean force from being sent to Delhi next morning; and even if the mutiny had not been trampled out then and there a railroad from Ujmballa to Delhi would have brought down our European reserve through a friendly country before the mutineers could have placed guns in position or made other preparations for their defence. In like manner a railway from Calcutta would have brought up Havelock's force in time to have enabled him to relieve Cawnpore; and the reinforcements which were slowly making their way up the valley of the Ganges when the last advices came away would have reached him in good time for the relief of Lucknow. It ispainful to readi such announcements as these, when we know that whole regiments may be conveyed by rail, with their equipments and guns, in an incredibly short space of time:- 11 It is impossible to place a wing of Earopeans at Cawnpore in less time than 25 days." *The Government dawk and the dawk companies are fully engaged in carryIng a company of the 84th to Benares, at the rate of 18 men a-day." " The bullock train can take 100 men a-day, at the rate of 30 miles a-day." The Governor-General to Sir Henry Lawrence, May 24, 1857. The permanent way of a railway cannot easily be destroyed, especially in a flat country like the valley of the Ganges; and partial injuries to the rails and bridges are easily repaired. In the SO miles which had been completed beyond Allahabad the rails were torn up in seven or eight places while that part of the country was in the possession of the insurgents, but this was soon set right by a pilot-engine with a supply of spare rails. However complete our railway system may be, a sufficient force must, of course, be maintained in proper central positions to overpower opposition whereever it may appear. To do otherwise would be like keeping too smaU a stock of gunpowder because we have the use of a first-rate gun. It is an important fact that the existing police force, which would form the basis of the new Indian constabulary, has, with insignificant exceptions, remained faithful to us. There are several essential points of difference between such a body and our late Bengal Sepoy army. The constabulary would be a strictly local force. Their families would be pledges for thfir fidelity, as in the case of the Madras army and of the Jaghiredar Horse. The first step to combination would be wanting, because the police of one zillah would be as unlnown to that of another as if they did not belong to the same force. Even the police of the same zillah would not be brigaded together. The organization would be by companies, which would be distributed in the strength required among the different thannahs or subordinate police districts ; and at the zilah station, under the immediate superintendence of the European offcer, would be a select body with a higher rate of pay, which would furnish the guards for the gaol, treasury, kutcherry, &c., and would be used as a reserve to support any of the thanahe where there might happen to be a pressure. This head-quarter company would be trained to the use of firearms, and would have a proportion of mounted men, while the rest of the zillah police would be armed with swords. In districts which have been completely disarmed and tranquillized we may even arrive at the use of the " little stick," which was the admiration of our continental visitors at the time of the Great Exhibition. Our main object should be to raise the character of the important class of police officers known by the name of thanadars. WVhether it can be done by a more liberal and suitable mode of remuneration, by a mere careful selection of candidates for the oflice, including perhaps, a certain proportion of young men from the Irish and English constabulary, expressly trained for the purpose by a more vigilant system of superintendence, or by all combined, this lies at the foundation of the establishment of a good system of police, which is only second to the reorganization of the native army, and must be undertaken in connexion with it. The European of'icers belonging to the Bengal constabulary should have a separate line of promotion, with proper rates of pay and pension, and with promotion for the ablest of them to the offices of Deputy-Inspector and Inspector-General. It rmay be expected that at the first constitution of this force many well-qualifed officers will volunteer for this service from among the supernumerary officers of the dissolved Bengal Sepoy army. I have the honour to hp A-n INSDOPHILTJS. London, Oct. 6.
TRE HIEALTH OF LONDON. (From the Weel;y Return of the Registrar-General.) In the week that ended on Saturday (October 3) the number of deaths registered in London was 1,087. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average numler of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,136, whicb, If raised in proportion to increase of population, becomes 1,250. The deaths from diarrhcea last week were 79, being nearly the same as in the previous week, when they were 83. There were no deaths from cholera among adults, but two cases of infants who died of choleraic diarrhcea are referred to this head. A potman, aged 34 years, died in the Hackney Workhouse on the 28th of September of "natural decay, accelerated by wan." On the 3d of July the wife of a sergeant committed suicide with cyanide of potassium. On the 15th of July a woman committed suicide with the same substance ; and, on the 29th of August, the son of a sergeant, aged 6 years, was poisoned by it, the bottle which held it having been left within his reach. Cyar,ide of potassium is used by soldiers for cleaning their lace. Of six nonagenarians whose deaths are returned the oldest are two men, aged respectively 04 and 95 years, and a woman who died in the workhouse, Newington, at the age (as stated) of 105 years. Last week the births of 916 bovs and 849 girls-in all 1,765 children-were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-5G the a-ferage number was 1,441. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwicb, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 868 in. The mean temperature was 58-4 deg., which is 4-6 deg. above the average. The mean daily temperature was more or less above the average throughout the week, The wind was generaly in the south-west. No rain fell except on Monday, when the amount was 0-17 in. 14,259 persons died in the quarter that ended September 26. The number exceeds by nearly 200 that of the same period in 1856; but if diarrhcea had not prevailed more in the past summer then it did in 1856 other conditions being unaffected, the present returns would have indicated a superior degree of health. In the last three summers the total deaths were (taking them in the order of time) 13,042, 14,066, 14,259; and the deaths from diarrhmea were 1,258, 1,610, 2,343. The influenceof a particular disease in raising the total mortality, which would otherwise be stationary or depressed, is palpable in these numbers; and a like increase Is traced in the deaths attributed to complaints of a kindred character, and tc some sporadic diseases affecting the alimentary system. Dysentery was fatal in the three sum. mers to 46, 73, and 84 persons; cholera to 106, 131, and 177 persons, To tabes mesenterica 262, 284, 333 deaths are referred; to disease of the liver, 122, 143, 187; and under teething, though the number decreased in 1S56 from 141 to 122, it rose this summer to 163. The unusual heat experienced in the first months of the quarter, co-operating with exigencies that are more under control, has perhaps been mainly efficacious in producing these results; but with the knowledge that cholera has been lately infesting parts little removed from our coast it may be conjectured that the epidemic virus extended itself in a milder form beyond the immediate field of action, its advance in force being only a question of time and opportunity. The speculation may be futile, but the facts must be admitted, and su ply a more than sufficient motive for preparation. The heat of the last quarter is its most striking meteorological feature, and will be described by stating that the mean temperature was 63-6 deg., which is 3 5 deg. above the average, and that there was an excess in the mean temperature above Its average in 12 weeks out of the 13, and on 1 days out of the 91. The result is a reduction in the mortality of pulmonary diseases, particularly bronchitis and pneumonia; and it will be seen also that cephalitis, apoplexy, and paralysis were less fatal than usuaL

ACCIDEENT ON THE TEENT VALLEY RAILwAY.- On Monday morning, at half-past 2 o'clock, as the Great Northern express mail train was proceeding towares Rugby, and within two miles of it, while coming down an incline at a great speed (ib being more than half an hour behind time), the train, which was a long one, became separated in about the centre. The engine being partly set free, now ran at a fearful speed, and the guard's break, which was behind the engine, also became detached. The driver, finding that his train was separated fronm him, it is said, reversed his engine, and thus the middle portion of the train became jarred between the hinder portion of the carriages that became first liberated and the engine, The consequence was that the break was smashed, and Mr. M''Geach, a gentleman from Shrewsbury, received internal injuries of a painful nature, but to wbat extent, up to 8 o'clock last evening, the Messrs. Bucknill, of Rugby, his medical attendants, were unable to ascertain, but they hoped he was progressing favourably. Mr. Jones, a travelling Post-office clerk, also received a cut which completely split his nose in two parts. Dr. Lewis was in attendance npon him, having been sent expressly from London. Mr. Ashby, of Staines, received a wound on the forehead. Mr. Grew, the stationmaster of Rngby, had the sufferers immediately conveyed to the Eagle Hotel, Rughy, where they received all the attention their casesdeanadded. Mr. Ashby left for home by the 8.30 train yesterday morning.
GLASGOW A UTUMN CIRCUIT COURT. GLASGOW, MONDAY. The Glasgow Autumn Circuit terminated to-day after a sederunt of five days. It should have been opened on Tuesday, the 29th of September, by Lords Cowan and Handy. side, but a day was lost from a curious and unprecedented circumstance. Glasgow and Stirling are divisions in what is termed the " Western Circuit," and it so happened that the recent trial of the Falkirk Bank fraud was lengthened out beyond au calculation, and extended into Tuesday, the day appointed for the opening of the Glasgow court. Lord Handyside conducted the Stirling case, and Lord Cowan came to Glasgow ready to open the court, but a doubt was raised that he conld not legaly go to business so long as his learned brother had not finished his work in Stirling; a large body of officials and witnesses and 100 jurymen consequently remained in idleness during the day, anxiously looking for a telegram announcing the termination of the Stirling trial, so that the Glasgow assizes might be commenced. The despatch did arrive, but not till 7 o'clock at night, when Lord Cowan proceeded to the Court-house, accompanied by the clerk and macer, and, having'lighted a gas-burner, formally opened'the court. He then dismissed an imaginary audience and jury, adjourning the proceedings till next day, when the business commenced legally and m earnest. In all there were 5S cases, in which 84 persons were imphcated. Few of them presented any features of interest. Some burglars and garrotters were sentenced to ten years' penal servitude. One case lasted two days-that of a batch of five Roman Catholics who were concerned in what is known as the Airdrie Riots. These took place upon the occasion of an Orange Procession on the 13th of July last, when the menmbers of it were awfully mauled and the town was in possession of the rioters for some hours. They were convicted and sentenced to-day-three of them to four years' penal servitude, one to 18, and another to 10 months' imprisonment. A second batch, consisting of four men engaged in these riots, pleaded Guilty, and were sentenced -three to 18 months' and one to 12 months' imprisonment. Three men were also convicted of being concerned in a serious riot which tookplaco at the Paisley races in August last, when several people were left almost dead upon the field. One of the men was sentenced to three years' penal serni tude, a second to 18 months', and the third to one month's imprisonment. In consequence of this and similar occurrences for years past it has been resolved formally to discontinue the Paisley races, after having been regularly held for nearly 200 years.
POLICE. MA?NSIoN.HoUsE.-John lBriley and James Pritchett5 the former a greengrocer, the latter a brushmaker carrying on an extensive buwineas in Kent-street, Borough, were brought before Mr. Alderman HR , charged with receiving two cases of bristles, of the value of 801., weU knowing them to have been stolen. Alderman HALF refused to accept bail for either of the prisoners, who were remanded. Charles Fould, alias De Fleury, aIijl)e Henry, alius M'Mabon, was brought up on remand by Inspector Emmerson of the P division of the Metropolitan }olice, chargedwith having obtained upwards of 1,0001. worth of goods from Mr. J. F. Sykes, flannel and blanket manufacturer, of 72, Aldermanbury, by false pretences. Mr. Lewis, Jnn., again appeared on the part of the prosecution, and the prisoner was defended by Mtr. Sleigh. The evidence given at the lsst examination was to the effect that the prisoner had obtained possession of the goods by falsely and frandulently representing to the prosecutor that he was related to M. Fould, the Minister of the Interior in France, and that he had a contract with the French Government to supply a large quantity of blankets for the Camp at Chalons. Mr. Sykes, the prosecutor, was further examined, and in reply to Mr. Lewis said,-In June last the prisoner gave me anorderfor l50 toilet quilts. Hesaid they mustbepacked in double canvas, asthey weregoing to Paris, I afterwardsdelivered three cases of quilts to a man named Peter Ward, who wasthe prisoner's porter. Theprisoneraskedfor samples, saylug he thought he should be able to sell a quantity of them in Paris. The goods amounted to 1041., and were delivered on the 15th of June. On the 18th I delivered blankets to him, through Ward, of the value of 1411. 3s. 6d., which he said were for the French armv. Between the 18th and the 24th be gave me an order for 100 pairs of sample blankets, bnt of a larger size than the others. The value of these w.as 1131.15s. 7d. I afterwards delivered him four bales of blankets, consisting of 222 pairs, and amounting in value to 1861. lOs. 6d. At the timethese were delivered he told me t get the remainder of the 5,000 pairs as soon as pos. sible, as he wanted to draw his money from France. If I had known that his name was not Fould, that he was not a relative of the Minister of France, that he had no order from the French Government for the supply of blankets, and that the goods were not to go to France, I should not have parted with my goods. I would not have su plied him on credit to any amount Cross-examined.-I sold the prisoner goods in May to the amount of 1441. 4s. 6d. I received a biU for those goods, which has been dishonoured. A biU I received from him of 11Y was paid. He referred me to a firm whom I saw before I parted with my goods. I received from him about 1301. on account of the balance he owed me. Peter Ward, formerly porter to the prisoner, deposed to having on various occasions taken goods from the warehouse of the prosecutor to the premises of Mr. Arnold, a packer inBarge-house-yard, where they were packed and taken to the warehouse of Mfr. Hart, in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. About the end of July he took four bales of gods direct from the warehouse of the prosecutor to that of E. Pound, a porter in the service of Mr. Arnold, a packer in Barge-house-yard, Bucklerebury, proved that many bales of goods had been brought to his master's premises by Ward, who took them away after they were packed. Mr. Solomon Levy EHart.-I am a merchant and warehouseman, and reside at 22, Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. I have known the prisonerabout four months, and have been in the habit of purchasing goods from him. I keep no bought ledger, but there is in my checkbook an entry of every payment made to the prisoner to correspond with the invoice. I Day every morning before half-past 10 o'clock for all the goods I purchase throughout the entire kingdom, and therefore I have no occasion to keep a bought ledger. Alderman HALZ.-I require you to produce whatever tooks you do keep at the next examination. Examination continued.-I was not asked by the prosecutor to show him my books. It is true that Inspector Emmerson asked to see thenm I deny that I altogether refused to let him see them. I did refuse to let him see them once because it was not oonvenient, but I did not appoint any other time when he rmight see them. I have purchased blankets, flannels, and various otber artiles of the prisoner, and the things were delivered in the course of trade. I sometimes saw the goods at 3, Cannon-street; on other occasionsi at a packer's in Bucklerabury. The prisoner carried a key with him which opened the door of the room at the packer's premises in which the goods were deposited. I recollect three cases coming to me. The prisoner showeed me three samples of quilts, which I purchased of him. I think he said there would be 50 of each size. I think there were three sizes. I purchased them of him at a price. I forget the actual price. The quilts came to me in three usual Manchester cases. I gave the prisoner 7s. 6d. or 7s. 9d. for each of them, and sold them at 8s. Gd. I don't care what they were invoiced at. That is not my business. I sold them to a merchant whose name I refuse to give. It wvould be a serious injury to me in my business if I disclosed the name of theparson to whom I sold thegoods. I have no idea how much money I have paid the prisoner. r. I,ewis.-I should very much like to know the name of the merchant to wvhom you sold these goods. Witness.-I won't give yon his name, you may rely upon Alderman IALE.-The prisoner wiiU be remanded, and at the next examination Mr. Hart must bring his books and invoices referring to these transactions. Remanded accordingly. GUILDHALL.-M. Alexandre BonviUe, a French gentleman, described in the police-sbeet as an hotel proprietor, residing at 2, Tudor-street, Blackfriars, was brought up In custody before Mr. Alderman PHILLIPS, charged with feloniously violating the person of Harriet Elizabeth Thomas, a married woman. Alderman PHILLIPS, after a most patient hearing, said, there could be no doubt this was a most painful case, but it had had a most careful investigation, and he had bestowed considerable attention in reading over the whole of the evidence in order that he might arrive at a just conclusion, and he had come to the determination to dismiss the charge. The prisoner was therefore discharged. Bow-sTnEh-.-A dissipated-looking youtb, named Frederick Woodland, was placed at the bar on the charge of being found in the cloisters of the Cathoiic Apostolic Church, in Gordon-square, for some supposed unlawful purpose. There had been a special service at the church that day, and the verger being occupied In the church, the cloisters, which form a communication with the private apartments, were left unguarded. A good deal of property is thus left exposed on tbese occasions, and of late robberies of smaU articles have become frequent. In the middle of one of the services the Rev. Samuel Hollick, one of the ministers, passed through the cloisters towards the church to take his part in the ceremony, and found the prisoner lurking about n the cloisters. He must have entered by the church door, passed through several private passages and a glass door, and descended a flight of stairs in order to reach the place where he was found. As he could give no satisfactory ascount of himself he was given in charge. The prisoner, who described himself as of no home and no oceBpation and who offered no intelligible defence, was committed to prison for 21 days. MARL1OROUGnSvTRERT.-Edward Penfold, a young man about 30 years of age, was charged with robbing his employer, Mr. WilliamHolland, of 23, Monnt-street, upholsterer to Hler Majesty, The prosecutor begged to be allowed to intercede for the prisoner, who had for some time held in his house a situation of great trust, and hoped tle magistrate would deal sumamarily with the case, and t at as leniently as he could, instead of sending it for trial. The prisoner pleaded " Guilty," and Mr. Br?zom.&,,t remanded him for a week to consider the Jamnes Williams, of 4, George-street, Sheffield; William Smith, of Alfred-place, Blackfriars, a medical student; and Alfred Bell, of Peter-square, Hammersmith, w ere charged with niotous conduct in the Turkish l)ivanl, 62, Hiaymarket, and assaulting Thomas Ingram, a waiter there, at 3 o'clock in the morning. It was shown clearly by the evidence that the defendants commenced the disturbance by a fight with some gentleman who had come in, succeeded by knocking the hats of others off or over their eyes, and flourishing chairs about, in which much damage was effected, a marble table broken, and other damage, altogether to the amount of 41. 15s. The assault, most unprovoked, was described as being of a brutl nature, the waiter being, when knocked down, kicked on thn eye, which bled very much. Williams and Bell were fined 51. each and the amount of damage, or to be committed for two months each, and Smith to enter into recognizanoes to keep the peace. Macelin Roland, a foreigner, the keeper of an eating-house in Cranbourne-street, was brouqht up for final examination charged with criminally assaulting Harriet Anderson, a girl 14 years of age. The prisoner was fully committed. yLxBoNrE-The court was crowded to excess ironsequence of its having been the day appointed by Mr. BROUG}uTON for the further examination of John Marks, ceachbuilder, Bell-street, Edgeware-road; Samuel Marks, his brother, and Abraham Simmonds, all of whom stood charged with having been concerned in the fraudulent disposal of property to the amount of many thousands of pounds subsequently to a fiat of bankruptcy against the first-named prisoner. Particulars of vvhat transpired at former inquiries have appeared in our paper. Mr. Giffard attended for the proseoution, Mr. Sleigh for Samuel Marks and Simmonds, and Mr. Solomon for John M arks. Mr. Wilding was also present to watch the case on behalf of several creditors. The first witness was William Cook, a oloth merchant, 78, Edgeware-road, who was acquainted with the bankrupt John Marks, who purchased some goods of him, the first parcel being on the 1st of January last; he subsequently pur chased anotherparcel,and the whole amount was ,061.16s.lOd. The articles were adapted for carriage lining, &c., and, at the request of John Marks, witness drew upon him a bill for the debt, which he accepted, but it had not been taken up. The last parcel was delivered on the 3d of] March. William Matthew Bywater, manager to Messrs. WiLkinson and Kidd, sadlers, Oxford-street, said, that the bankrupt had purchased of him (witness) 50 saddles, of the value of 3001, in November last, and that they wero delivered on the 19th of December. In theearlypart of the present year he bought 44 saddles, the price of both purchases being 5881. 16s When he first called he represented that the goods were intended to be shipped for Melbourne, but that as the voyage would be long, and consequently delay would take place before he could realize money upon the articles, he could not pay till the expiration of nine months, adding, that his brother was about to sail for Melbourne immediately, and that he was anxions he sbould take the goods with him. He (witness) received bills from hismfortheamount before-nentioned, and they had not been paid; he was still a creditor under the bankruptcy, and had received no dividend. Mr. Solomon.-There is now 5,000. or more in the hands of the assignees. Abraham Riddeford, 14, Basinghall-street, formerly in business as a clothier, stated that on the 3d of December last John Marks came to him, and said he required a quantity of woollen goods for Australia. Ho advised him not to purchase goods of the kind for that market, when he observed, "M y brother, who is there, must surely be a good judge as to whether they will sell or not." Witness, with John and SamuelMiarks, went to a warehouse in Milk-street, where purchases of different coloured clothes were made to the amount of 226t. 8s. ld. Jobn Marks had also woollen mats value 461. 10s. The whole of the property was delivered to the bankrupt at his premises in Bellstreet. Robert Earland, a varnish maker at Mitcham, said that on the 19th of February last he supplied John Mlarks with 5101. worth of goods, which were delivered at his place of business in Bell-street; he received a bill at six months, and had proved the debt at the Court of Bankruptcy. William Hall, agent to Noble and Hoare, Cornwall-road, Lambeth, said that he served John Marks with varnish and black japan in last December to the amount of 2391., and the goods were delivered In February. He (Marks) gave him a bill payable in 12 months; he had proved the debt in the Conrt of Bankruptcy. By Mr. Solomon.-I was acquainted with him for some time and would have given him credit, though not to the same extent, unless I had felt positively assured that they were bondjlclc intended for shipment, as the sale of so large a quantity for the home market might have injuriously affected me in my business. James Morris, 28, King-street, Cheapside, stated that-he supplied John Mark-s with cloths to the amount of from 1,OOI1. to 1,100L at different periods, the first parcel being delivered to him on the 1(;th of February, and the last on the 1st of April. IHe (Marks) told him that he wished to ship the goods to Melbourne. He was one of the assignees of the bankrupt's estate. Christopher Holt, Iron bedstead-maker, Tottenham-courtroad, stated that he supplied the bankrupt with goods to the amount of 1011. 17s. John Frederick Wust, a pianoforte maker, 15, Uyper York-street, Bryanston-square, said that he supplied John Marks with four pianos, value 1591., for which he received three bils. A man named Molloy-he had been examined on a former occasion-took away the goods from his premises; they were packed in tinned cases of the usual form, WiUiam MoUoy, whose previons evidence has already appeared, stated that the goods referred to in the preceding testimony had been received at the premises of the bankrupt, in whose service he was, and that they were packed up under the direction of his employer (John Marks). The other prisoners occasionaUy assisted him in the packing ; portions of the goods were sent to Reigate, Ipsaricb, Cambndge, and Weymouth, and he (witness) received money at different times for his trouble. Witnews here repeated a part of his previous evidence relative to his going to Reigato, and seeing some of the goods deposited there in a barn, and also to a portion of them being placed in the house of a man named Mandeville, Kent-street, Borougb. Cross-examined by Mr. Sleigh.-At the lat examination I was absent. I was in the hands of the solicitors for the prosecution. I was sent to take a trip to Brighton for the benefit of my health. It is not true that I claimed 2001, from Samuel Marks, threatening that If he did not give me that sum I would transport them all. I repeat, upon my oath, that I never made a demand of the kind, nor even a request to either of the parties to that effect. I wrote a letter, but it was by direction of Samuel Marks and in his back parlour. By Mr. BROUGGTOGS.-I mean to swear that what I have stated is true and that I will abide by it. M.. Sleigh (handing him a letter).-Is that your handwriting 9 Witnesg.-It is. Heretheletterwasread. Itranasfollows:- - Sir,-I tbink you have behaved ext;emesy bad t me *Iter workiug dsy and night to get your goods all nicely Packed for you. Yon paid me only apaltry 5s. Now, unlesa yon give nne £200 I will go to the B.nkruptay Court In Blaslugball-treeta nd wll Fend Von aU out of tie country. I kwow that you did not give mere than three parts value for the goods, and you send to mny hbouoe the £1e00. I wrll give you a few days to cenaider, and if son do not send you wi he sorry for it, for I will swear anything to get that amount, or more if I can. "Your obedient servant. -- WILLIAMi MOLLOY." By Mr. Sleigh.-The envelope of this letter is in my handwriting. BMr. Giffard.-Samuel Marks made an appointment v.t me, rcd I wrote the letter at his dictation. He wanted to send me to New Zealand. He gave me a sovereign after I had written the letter, Mr. BROUGHcTON expressed his conviction that the witness had been guilty of a gross act of permury. After some additional evidence the prironers were remanded till to-morrow (this day) week, upon which day the evidence will no doubt be completed and the case sent for trial. Application was made for bail, but Mr. BROic1i1oT refused to accede to the request. The prisoners were then removed from the bar, WESTy1NySTE'R-Thomas Basten, a pawnbroker's assistant, bearing a very good character, was finally examined, charged with stealing a gold ring, the property of Charlotte Glover, described as a single woman, living in College-street, Chelsea. He was fully committed for trial, the magistrate consenting to take bail for his appearance. The protracted case against Mr. Richard Clayton, jobmaster and sodawater and gingerbeer manufacturer. of Hugh-street, Pimlico, who stands charged with the violation of a child, was yesterday brought to a close. He had been remanded for the attendance of Mr.Blackmore, and, as she was now present, her deposition was read over and signed, It wiUl be remembered that on the previous examination the magistrate had refused to take bail, informing Mr. Solomon, prisoner's solicitor, that it was open to himn to apply Mr. PAm-rEx, upon this subject, now said that it was sometmes, in making such applications, implied that the magistrate advised that course, which he certainly did not on the present occasion. Mr. Solomon said that his affidavit drawn for the accused set forth that the magistrate had refused bail. Mr. PAvNTER wished it to be communicated that his reason for refusing to take bail was his firm conviction that if the prisoner were bailed the ends of justice would be de- feated. Mr. Sleigh, who prosecuted for the Associate Institute for the Protection of Women, said he would take especial care that the magistrate's reason for refusing bail was represented to the judge. MIr. P_A YNTER then called the father of the girl, and said he understood that large sums of money had been offered him to withdraw the prosecution. The father replied in the affirmative, Mr. Sleigh said that all tho influence that wealth could command would be used by the prisoner's friends. Mr. PAYTER observed that from circamstances that had come to his knowledge it was to be feared that endeavours would be made by zealous friends of the prisoner to get the girl out of the way. In order to secure her attendance he should require her father to enter into recognizances of 2001. for her appearance upon the trial; that would induce him to be very careful of her and not allow her to go out of doors. If any attempts were made to frustrate the ends of justice they might depend upon it they would recoil upon the accused. He had some ground of defence to the charge, and in the very able hands in which his case had been placed they would be cultivated to the very best advantage. Mr. Solomon tlanked the magistrate for the high compliment he had paid him, and said it would be his duty te use his best exertions for his client. Prisoner was then committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court. The accused reserved his defence, by the advice of his solicitor, but ho positively denied the offence imputed to him. WORS=P-STREET.-William Brownbill. a morose-looLing middle-aged man, described as a shoe and washhandstand- maker, was charged with feloniously cutting and wounding his wife, with intent to murder her. On being called upon for his defence, The Prisonersaid,-It appears to mle like a dream. I recollected nothing about it till it was all over. I had been out of my mind, I think. I had no intention to do it, and was in an unconscious state when I did it. A communication, however, was here handed up to the magistmte from hfr. Wakefield, the surgeon of the House of Detention, to whioh the prisoner had been remanded while his wife was under medical attendance, and the purport of this was that he had carefully examined the prisoner while in confinement there, but had not detected any peculiarty In his manner or conduct which would indace the belief that his intellects were at all affected. The depositions were thereupon taken by Mr. Hurl. stone, the chief clerk, and the prisoner was fully committed to Newgate for triaL CLERICPWELL.-John Lowe, a rough-looking fellow, aged 24, a horsekeeper, residing at 6, Camden-passage, Ilington-green, was charged writh committing a series of violent assaults under the following circumstances:- Mr. James Rodgers, landlord of the Barnsbary Castle publichouse, York-place, Barnsbury,said, the precdingnight, between the hours of 6 and 7, the prisoner, whom he had never seen before, entered his house and asked to be served with some beer. He being the worse for liquor, his (the prosecutor's) daughter refused to serve him; and he then made use of the most disgsting and abuaive language. When the prisoner WaS asked to go out ho refused to do so, upon which he proceeded to turn him oat. When he was put outside the door witness picked up a large int stone, and whilo he was holding the door to prevent hinm from coming in the prisoner struck him a tremendous blow on the face with the stone, cutting his nose and black- ng one of h,s eyes. A number of persons came to his assistance, and the prisoner blacked the eyes of more than a Mr. Charles Coulson said he was at the BArnabury Castle, and was rendering assistance to the last witness, when the prisoner bit off one of his knuckles, and bit through another of his fingers. Mr. Edward Thomas Foreacre said he " helped to push that gentleman out of the house, (meaning the prisoner), when he was struck on the left eye, which was blackened im consequence. It was stated by the prosecutor that several persons were most grossly assaulted by the prisoner, whose conduct was of the most violent nature. Police-constable Iarsh, 170 N, took the prisoner into custody, and en his way to the station he threw him down twice, and also kicked him. The prisoner in defence said he was extremely sorry for what he had done, and begged to be forgiven, as he was the worse for liquor. Mr. TYrWHnIT said the prisoner was a perfect brute, and a very dangerous fellowv. He should, for the first assault, fine him 20s., or 14 days' imprisonment; 51., or two montbs, fortheassault on Mr. Coulson, 10s., or a week, for the assault on the police-constable, and 20f.s, or 14 days, for the assautlt on Mr. Foreacre. The prisoner was locked up in default. THAXES.-Frederick Knack, a German, was charged before Mr. SELFE with feloniously wounding with a knife with intent to do some grievous bodily injury, Charles Smith, also a German, a seaman, living at No. 3, Frederick. etreet, St. George's-in-the-East. The prisoner w.as committed for trial, without bail being accepted. SOuTmwARAK.-Frederick Revell and William Saunders were brought before Mr. BURCILAM, charged with the following daring highway robbery. Wiliam Henry Henner said, that about 10 o'clock on the previous night he was proceeding home along Black. friars-road, when his attention was attracted to some men preaching at the Obelisk in the Circus. There was at that time a mob of persons collected about the spot, and he wentL among them to hear the discussion. While etanding there the prisoner Revell, who was standing at his left side, put his right hand across his breast, and at the same time he felt his watch go. He then saw Revell hand the witch to Saunders, and then witnees seized hold of them both, and, a constable coming up at the time, they were both. secured. His watch was picked up and handed to the policeman by a person amiong the crowd. In answer to Mr. BuRcE[Ar, witness said that at the time four men were holding forth at each corner of the Obelisk. Some were preaching about religion, and others were discussing about politics. There was considerable confusion, and he believed that nearly all the people collected there were thieves. The prisoner Saunders here said that the gentleman must be mistaken about him. He never had the watch. The prosecutor declared most positively that he saw ReveU pass it to him. James Brookes, a respectable meebanic, said he was standing behind the prosecutor when he seized hold of the rsoners, and then he distinctly saw Saunders drop a watch. Witness directly stooped down to pick it up, when another man attempted to kick it away, but he pushed him off and obtained possession of the watch, which he handed to police-. constable 86 L, who took him into custody. The latter stated that he was on duty About the Obelisk in private clotbes, when he saw Revell put one of his hands across the prosecutor's shoulders, and then they had a scuffle together. The prosecator caled out that he had been robbed of his watch, when he secured the prisoner, and received the watch from last witnesa. Mr. BCmRCH asked the prisoners what they had to say in answer to the charge9 After some little hesitation they both acknowledged their euilt, and begged his worship to deal with them in a sammary Way. Mr. BUnRCrAM inquired whether they were known ? The constable replied that they were well-knowvn thieves, but he was not aware that they had been previously ron. victed. Mr. BEuRcCAm told them tbat be had no doubt they were connected with a gang of ruffianly fellows wbo collected about the Obelisk for the purpoee of robbing the public, who might be induced to stop and listen to the blasphemous language. He was surprised, after so many robberies had been committed at that spot, that any recpectable person should be foolish enough to stop,as they might almost sure to be robbed. He only wished aU those who were attracted to the epot were as quick as the prosecutor ; then there would be very little occupation for such scoundrels. Under all the circumstances he should not be doing his duty anless he sentenced each of them to six months' hard labour in the House of Correction. LAMrBETH.-John Doyle, atias Edward Sims, alias James Hill, was brought up on remand before Mr. ELLIOTr for further examination on a charge of obtaining money by means of forged begging-letters. Mr. ELLIOTT convicted the prisoner as a rogue and vagabond, and sentenced him to three months' hard labour. adding that if he appeared again on such a charge he would be dealt with as an incorrigible rogue and vagabond, and be sent to prison for 12 months, with the additional punishment of a sound flogging.
SMUGGLTSG ON THE SusSsLX COAST.-Yeaterday T. Bruce and H. Everett, of Portsmoutb, and J. Wicks, of Angmering, mariners, and T. C. Elliott, master of a vessel called the lntrepid, were brought up at Arundel, before Mr. R. Prime (chairman), Mr. J. Evans, Mr. J. C. Fletcher and htr. E. Henty, eharged with smuggling between 50 ana G0 tubs of Geneva, with intent to defraud the revenue of 3001, Mr. Cumberland, from London, appeared for the Crown. All the prisoners except the master (Elliott) pleaded "Guilty." Air. Cumberland stated the case, andc then called James Bishop, a coastguardsman on the Littlehampton service, who deposed that about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 24th ult. he observed a boat with three men In it, coming towards the shore. At this time between 30 and 40 men, whom he did not know, were hovering about the shore. He became suspiciors that something was wrong, fired his pistol, and showed his bluelight to alarm the coast. guard service. Mr. J. D. Beach, 2lasterintheRoy.l Navy, and chief officer In the Littlehampton Coastguard service, stated that seeing the bluelight he had a galley manned and put off to sea. After puLUing about two miles fron the shore they came up to a vessel of suspicious appearance, which they boarded. On it they found only the master (EUiott), who said he was on his way from Portsmouth to Shorebam. Shortly afterwards they puUed up to a boat which had the other three prisoners on board. They had with them be. tween 30 and 40 tubs of Geneva, and in the vicinity of the boat were floating from 15 to 20 other tubs. Tbey took all the prisoners, with the tubs, into custody. The connexion of the vessel with the boat havin& been clearly established Mr. Cumberland showed by the evidence of a witness names Cownden that Elliott and Everett had been acting together recently in London with the Intrepid. Mr. James, collector of Customs for the port of Arundel, proved that 64 tube, which were found in the custody of the prisoners, had been handed over to him they comprised 38 of GeDeva and 26 of brandy, all nearly 50 per cent. over proof. The duty upon the same amounted to 3001. The bench expressed themselves satisfied with the guilt of the prisoners, and sentenced the master (Elliott) to nine months' imprisonment, and the other three to eight months' esch. The vessel and other property is confiscated. AUDACIOUS ROBBERY BY A POLICE'IA Al SnrEuDs.-On Saturday morning one of the recently appointed police officers o North Shields was apprehended by the superintondent and lodged in one of the ceUs on a eharge of having committed an audacious street robbery. His name is Robert Brown, and he came into the force about two weeks ago with a very exceUent character. It seems that a seaman named William Hoskins had been looked out of the Sailors' Home and had faUen in with the offieer Brown. Brown had taken him to the Night and Day publichouse, but the landlord could not give him quarters, and the sailor had subsequently turned on to the New Quay, where he fell asleep. He had been a6woke during the night by feeling some one taking the bandkerehief off his neck, and then discovered that the officer Brown was robbing him; and some little time afterwards, on coming to his senses-for he had been tipsy-he found that his pockets had been rifled by the polieeman of his purse and money, a ring, and several other articles of property. As soon as the superintendent heard of the robbery, as we have raid, be apgrehended Brown, who has admitted his guilt to him. As Brown has been very attentive to drunken men ince be came into the force, and had got the name of " an active officer" in that respect, it is not imnprobable but he may have eased some others of their superfluous cash who have been found in a similar predicament to the sailor. The magistrates have remanded him.-Globe. [h Advertisement, -" India," by J. HI. Stocqueler.

My Dlear lPrIend,-I amn desirous of sending a fewv lines by this 'mail on the subject of that Relief Fm-d( in which2 your attenition was 'directed last mail in the letters padcs'csed by DSr. reshlko to Sir G. vol.lock, Sir Rt. Pesel, Mr. Dluffell, Major Md'Gregor. and yourself. I tan. InrC l-A r sho-eld Ilke) enter fully into the cases that come before owr enb'commnIttee. but I should like to placo before you come of the CLi~ss.se 0ase- in which theassis,tance ofthe funtdwillboerequired. I do not doubt thLe warma sympathy af the pubhic or their liberality in 'this extraordinar emergency, lInt it tisrery desirable that the nature of tbe rewe should be well understood at home. It is comn. moonly supposed that all pe'rpi5 in Inidia have larne Incomes and are eaviug fortunes. Yeni know how differnt is the fact, and it would he vell if all others know It toe. ( Lre large class is that of young officers who were living in soountry Vistions where It had been necessary for them on their arrival to pur. rcrase or Ic buill their dwellings. These houses, with their hormses tatir ouffit, and thoir equipisent, uoually constituted their entire pro. testy, aod I in mny cases the whole has been suddenly destroyed, and they have escaped barsly wis'h their ives. The csase of this; kind are very numerouts Indeed. In thes ell relief Is necessary, unless we are WiUlrog that EUch offcerz rhuold henceforth efraggla ou in life under toe load of debt whichi nni5t be incurred if they are without asist. ance to replace themselves In their former tio;ition. Another calas Is tha; of Olrixers whose Incomes would well suilice if they bedl not famiflies at home. 33rt, burdened with the heavy expense of thece, they have aa along been in difficulty, compelled to sacrifice mnuih to that iuev:table and exprenEive necessity of an Indian residence, a borne education for their children soad now to have to replace their h'ssuse, lurniture,anid accoutremnents, appears to theom a simple matter or impossiMHilty. Very mina' more are now compelled to Eend their tamrlies home. They tiirht have gone on for yeras to come in their statiOns, with occasional vlslta to the hills, hutl now suddenly aol' prematurely, coootemrporasroously wvith the loss of all their property, comres the necesity to send their familes to England. They munnot do without help). And this hind of difficulty and the hind of losses I have menitioned are not confined to officers ; they extend to young rivilans. to indigo platers, and other traders to shopkeepers, to untovenauted servants ia a great variety or eploymnents, to engineers, surveyors, clerks, sod many more. And thiea there are the bereved ; there are children 'without parents, wives without husbands -how maany we know naot yet, but they, too, unhappily, are many, andI in most cocci tire calamity has been attended with a rtuinous lss of property. You must be aware that very mnany cantonments, and other English stations ha'so been wholly burnt, and that marauders let looze fromn%os 51, irebelliotns soldiers anid others, have been carrying on ivilhout restraint the cystem of absolute plunder. Compensation is quite beyond our powver, hut If the l3rltish pubslic assist uis we can relieve effectually and substantially. Already the sub-corn. wnittes, to whom this task haa bee-n devolved. h%vo found large scope for the benevslenes of lbs subscribers, and have had their own sympa- thies deeply excited by the, affecting nature of the suffering with which they have benimne aocquainted. I entertai no doubt that the work will crow on our hands, that we shall have to scud homie hundreds and to I-revide some assistance inv'asious forms to thousandsi. We maust embrace the whole necessity of the case in a inrge and liberal spirit, and. as far as possible, do all that Is needful to relieve the pressur of this widte-,pread calamity. Blut, sa I have said, full compensation is quite out of the qusitlon. Some have beeni suddenly deprlved of large fortunes ; some, who were hoping to retire home, have been reduoced to beggary. The prospects of many families are entirely changed, ana, notwithstanding all that we can do, there vill remain a gret number for whom lbs F%ird can riocompDaratively notbisg. And then,Ifits othick of the t(oouumerous eases of mental ailliction, the bereavemrents, the broken hearts, the shuttered rerves, the shalien reason, the desolation, tilo abiding sense of horror, the varlotsc sicknesses coaeequent on expesire and priva. ticn. whatcan we say ? We ran do nothing. Ilrman power fails, and human sympathy can scarcely, alleviate tho trial. I coul.d barrow yen witht tales of Individual sorrow such aesoedonr has been comEequent On seasons of nationeal calamity since Flugland was a nation ; brst we must do all we mae, and I entertain no doubt that your commtttee at home wWl appeal with earneetness anid with suocms to the hearts of our favoured cotirntrymere." WOLVERHjAMlPTON. A meeting was held here yesterday in the Town-hall, the mayor presiding, Lord HATHRliT(N, respnded to the call of the mnay~or. Every man, he said, must have felt the deepesi Indignationl at the atrocities and harbarities which had been perpetrated by tho miutineers. Nothing equal to whiat had just happened had been heard of siliie the frightful excesses wlrich -erer perpetrated hy those who carsied the risord of Mais hbssret, anid attemupted with it to subvert India to the creed of the Prophet. Thbe state of things over which they fiow mounried was the oriore painful as it arose during a government which it could not be questioned hsrd been inore beneficial to India. than any that had preceded it for 2,0100 years. (Hear, hear.) This might be admitted without concealing tire faults of the English Government of India, and it had btexi full of faults that had yet to be remnedied. It was hardly neoessar7 for him to say a word in suipport of some great eIor bIng made to give spirit to those who were serving their coutry in India, and by the expressiona of our sympathy to cheer those whose spirits were drooping tlrere. T~heir aid was require-d not only for theo soldiers' wives and chiildren, and for those who woer suffering in the miidst of the scene of muttiny, but for that very numserous class, the children who had been loft parentless and alurost friendless at the several schools in this countr to whiich E~n lish people in India wore in the hiabit fseding their c2ilden. From this quarter he hiad been led to under. stand that tIre applicatiorrs for relief -would ho very nunrerout3. He did no t, however, desire to dwell upon tire mielancholy part of the picture,.lie wvished rather to refer to some one or two hright gleams in the othrerwise dark sky. There were, several reasons for supposing that the efforts which this countr-y was now puttiiig forth to atop the rebellion would soon be successful. IHe had been very inuch inathe habit, from the circuzisrtance of having married into the'Wellesley family more than 40 years ago, of iriovingz among Indian officers. Among these be had found a uini. versal and decided opinion that the efforts of this country mnust soon suppress the rebellion. No apprehension seemed to be, entertained by any isran to whkom ho husd spoken that this could not he done without thei aid of any native troops,. The greatest encouragemnent was to be derived froliis the gallant spirit iuranifestedI by the English recrtuits, nine out of every ten of whom enlisted into regiments serving in India, Such recruits showed thenmselves anxious to share asspedl as~ they could the perils of their country, sod to igaieaspirit of determination to risk their own lives in the cause of the heliplets and the unprotected. Anothor .source of encouragement was found in tho fidelity and loyalty* of the Ghoorka tribes. Universally the Sikii tribes, the most admirable part of the population of India, recenitly our for-, was now so satisfied with the excellenit tendenicy of the British Government ini the Puni~ab that they had very nserally expressed their wish to he eurployed in quellng tise disturbance. (Applause,) Another iniportant fact was that the llindoo population 'were, to say the least, universally quiescent. (Bear, boar.) In no district of Hindostan had the mutineers been able to establish civil power. The residents in this p art of India-- those resident only a few miles from Delhir-.- were now peacefull following their ordiniary agricultural pursuits. One advatage which would result froini this dreadful outbreak was that we should soon know wlio to trust. (Hear.) lie presumied that the Government would for the futuire he vey backward in placing any power In theo hands of the Mahomedan population, who in the person of ono of their ,well-known representatives had recently displayed tho mnost demoniacal spirit. We now were certain that, whatever the suLrface usiight appev.r, the Asiatic character remained the same and unalterable. In conversing with persons engaged in affairs having reference to ttile governmnent of 1ndia, this was their usiAvMral congratul.%tion, that now we should know whom to trust there; for the real feelinr, of the natives could not, unfortunately, be otherwise asceiZ tained than by some such outbreak as the one which now was raging. Tire first sacrifice in this insurrection, althouigh not a sacrifioe to the sword, yet to duty, was the gallant officer who long represented that division (South Stafford. shire), General Anson. (Hear, hecar.) lie had known the late General from early life-fromn the time when he commeinced his military career at Waterloo to that when he left -this country for India, and he had never known a man who possessed such great qualities for commnand and ad. ministration of anydecito as were posees8ed by General Ancon. (Hear, hear lie was fit for any emnergency. He (Lord Hatherton) bad never knownx a mnan who ho his whole demieanour and address possessed so great a charm as universally charaterized General Anson. (Applause.) Lord Eathertona concluded by movsng,_ "That this meeting deeply symPathizes, with the many sufferers I y the late mutiny of a iarge part of the natire lodlan armyv, and deeires to expreassits utmost detestation of thle barbarous crrelties Which have been perpetraied ou our helpless coluntrywomnen and their childres, and trusts that the Governmnent of this counitry and the Heon. Ea.t lndia Company will, under the Di'line blessing, be speedily enabled to suppasem the rebLellisus spirit of the disaffoetd and punish the guilty parties.,, Mr. TIfORNRLY, i.LP., seconded the resolution. He said perhaps it would be necessary by and by to inquire how it was that our civil force and army in India were so entirely misinfonned of this mirutiny before it broke out ; but that was not their present business. They had nowr to express their sympathy in a practical manner withl the suffering -men, women, and ohildren on whose behalf the meeting had been called. (Applause.) He had no doubt that the time would come at no distant period when this corrntry would have what was called reconquered India. (Renewed applause.) When that took place he hoped that the British troop6 would not im.tate those miscreants of whom they had recently read, but would respect the women of India, and respect the children. (Hear, hear.) There was no indisposition in this country to advance the interests of India. About six weeks ago he was one of ao deputation of merebhants, cottouspinners, and other gentiemen from the north of England who had waited upon Lord Palmerston at his private residence, dearing that tibe Gosornnrent would 'take meoares to promote the growtht of cotton in India. If 'the Government soold do so, the interests of India would nb greatly puromoted, while the apprehecions of the manu- et-erer thai there would be a sea~rcity of cotton would be xremoved. Itcould not be saidthat Eugland didnot understaud how to manage her eolonies. There were 27 coloaies now attached to the British empire, and every one of these was ,now doing well amsd flourishing. (Hear, hear.) le was 6adtthat LordHa.therton had referred to General Anson. oe (Mr. Thornely) Imnew him well, and a more able, honour. able, and upright man he had never been acquainted with. (Applause.) ie had great satisfaction in making a small contribution to the fund and in seconding the motion, (Renewed applause.) Lord HATBEtRTOx wished to add some further remarks. There never was a time when our colonies were in so satisfactory a stawte. (HIear, lhear.) lIe knew from the highest authority that the Canadian Legslature, who offered to| zaI4o koop5 dUialg the C4wesn war, had expressed an J equally g,ratifylng spirit now. Although they had not gone to tbat extent on the present occasion, yet they had expressvA their warmest sympathy with the mother country ia thls 'smergeDocy, and hoped that no native troops would be employed in efforts to quell the rebellion. (AppLause.) The strongest possible ass Lranoes of loyalty and devotion had st been received from theGovernment of Canada. (Hear.) He had also been told, though not upon so high an authority, that it was in the contemplation of the Government to send a regiment of blacks (laughter) fronm Jamaica. He believed at to be a very proper work for them (the negroes} to do. (Applause and laughter.) They were subjects of this country, were attached to it, were nearly acclimated, and he had no doubt that when they were put under the commnand of British officers would prove of great service. (Hear, hear.) Better employmsnt, he thought, could not be found for them. (Applause.) The resolution was then carried uncm. con. The Hon. Captain LESG riate of the Rifle Brigade) moved- " That In order to meet the urgent and immediate wants of the Fufferers thie meeting earne3lly solicito the contributioes of the pub- lic, and recom mends that eubeeription listEs le opened at allthe banks in the borough and its neighborbood" He could assure the meeting that nothing was so well calculated to encourage a soldier who, under trying circum. stances, was endeavouring to do his duty to his country in a foreign land as the assurance that he possessed the sympathy of his fellow-countrymen at home, that they were watching all his acts and duties, and were encouraging him to do his besL (Applause.) The Rev. Mr. DALTON, Rural Dean, seconded the motion, which was one, he said, that could be sup. ported as weUl by a clergyman as a soldier. It was iS duty, both in the pulpit and at such a meeting as this, to do all in his power to show and endeavour to pro. mote the deepest sympathy with those who were caled to endure unheard-of sufferings. (Applause.) Lord Hatherton had referred to one circumnstance in the history of Idia which might be said to be nearly a parallel case ; but really he thought that nothing in the hizstory of India, or any tranEaction in which England had been engaged, had at all approached to it in enormity. fHIear, hear.) In the case of Mahomet's successors, who camed everything before them at the point of the sword, they did so in obedience to their religion at the dictate of the Koran; but the actors now were those who struck down their benefactors, men by whom they had been tended with almost a fatherly care up to the very moment when they were turned upon and butchered by the very objec'ts of their attention (applauee) and this, to add to the enormity, was perpetrated before the eyes of their benefactors' wives and children, who in their turn were subjected to the most horrible barbaritise,-barbarities varied only by reversing the order of the cruelties and deaths which were inflicted. Other speakers foUowed ; the committee appointed wero instructed to put themselves into communication with the Lord Mayor's Committee, and upwards of 64914 was subscribed in the room. WORCESTERSHIRE. Sir John Pakington has published a letter recommending that a county meeting shall be held at Worcester with reference to the present state of affairs in India. Sir John writes:- -Itwems tomo thatthe time iE come when ItIs desirable to give every possible public proof that the magnrtude of the Crids in India Is appreciated at home, and that the people are resolved to meet the danger in a spirit worthy of the nation and of the occasion. " I therefore venture to propoae that we should present a requistion to the high sheriff, asking himn to convene a county meeting ; and that the objects of that meeting thould be not only to prove oursympathy for tho sufferings and mIsfortunes of our c.untrymen In the East, but also to adopt an address to the Queen, to assure Her Majesty, in the name of the county of Worcester, of our lo;alty and devotion, and of our firm determination to afford Her Majesty all the support in our power to enable her to suppress the rebelion in India and to oonduct the struggle to an honourable and triumphant issue." t-pon this suggestion a requisition has already been set on foot, and has received a large number of influential signatures. Lord Lyttelton, the Lord-Lieutenant of the county, heads the requisition., O dHALIFAX. On Monday a meeting was held at the Town-hall, Halifax, to consider tho best measures for raising subscrip. tions for the relief of the sufferers by the deplorable events now occurring in ludia. Archdeacon Musgrave, D.D, vicar, presided. The usual resolutions were unanimously adopted, and a subscription set on foot, to which the following contributions were made in the room :-Mr. B.

A meeting of the inhabitants of Bolton, convened by the Mayor (Mr. James Knowles), in cornpliance with the request of a numerous body of influential requisitionists, was held in the Town-ball on Monday evening " To express their sympathy with the cruel sufferings of our countrymen and countrywomen in India, and for the purpose of organizing means for raising eubscriptiins for their relief, consequent upon the atrocious and unhoard-of calamities to which they have been and are subjected in that distracted part of the British empire." The mayor presided, and the first resolution was moved by the vicar (the Rev. Henry Powell.) It was to the effect that the ineeticg, deeply sympathizing with the many helpless sufferers by the mutinies in India, desired publicly to record its senso of the great magnitude of the calamity and its detestation of the atrocities perpetrated, and trusted that such onergetic efforts would be made by the British Government and the Hon. the East India Company for the repression of the rebellion and the punishment of the mutineers as would, under the Divine blessing, be speedily successfuL The resolution was carried unanimously. The Rev. Henry H. Chettle moved a resolution soliciting the benevolent contributions of the inhabitants, which was also carried unanimously. A committee was appointed to carry out the object of the mneeting. SKIPTON. On Saturday an influential meeting was held at Skipton, ! in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to aid the fund for the rehef of the sufferers from the Sepoy mutiny. The Rev. D. BR.

ROYAL SUERRY GARDER8 COMPANY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-In the confusion which took paoe at the meeting On Monday your reporbter has fallen into an ehtraordiary error in stating that the armendfment of Mr. Coppook was carried. The very reverse is the fact. My reslaution for proceeding with the real busiiness of the meoeting-viz., the remnoval of the directors-was carried by a majority of at least 5$ to 1, and my miotion for adopting the whole of the first committee on that proposed by Mr. Ilining was also farried by nearly the whole meeting, there being only three h& nds h2d up against it. The motion for removing the dir,cctors w-ozld undoubtedly have been carried had there not j)een a wish on the part of some of the ghareholders toD ascertain more fully certain facts in relation to the mortga&ges, for which purpose Air. Viningnz motion for a fuLrther iL'vestigatioa was adopted. The favour of your insertion of this letter will much oNig Yr.ca- diqntservRn I THOS, B, FLEMMCGI
MP. INGRAM, ALtP., ON THE IXDIAN RBEVOLT. On Friday hr. Herbert In;grain, M.P., presided at the annual banquet of the Rickmawsorth Agricultural Associa. tiou, and, in proposing the toast of the evening, said,Gentlemen, this is the toast of aU the toasts, and I hope 0ou wiU see the propriety of drinking it in bumpers. In undertaking to propose to you this toast I have, I think imposed upon myself a responsibility which I am ill ablo to discharge. What we have to-day seen of the good working of this association ought to be considered as a great benefit conferred upon the country, Hero we have a society for improving an important manufacture-in faot, the greatest of all manufactures, the manufacture of meat and bread for the food of the people. (Hear.) It is the greatest of al manufactures, and yet it exists without any rivalry among those engaged in it. If my neighbour has a good crop or has made any improvement in farming I am delighted to see it, but you can never find one cotton printer lock without jealousgy upon the lmDrovements introduced into that manufacture by another. We do not ticket our goods as French goods, but allow them to rest upon their own merits, and I am sure that the success of our agrcul. tural association has been greatly promoted by the absence of All such feelings of envious rivalry. (Eear and cheers.) With regard to the success of this association, I must say that I never saw such ploughing as I did to-day, andE will add, that no man who saw the description of work which our ploughmen some years ago performed could at that time imagine that it was possible to raise the labour of the agricultural workmen to its present point of eminence. This is not the only good which associations like the present have accomplished, for they have fostered a feeling of emulation in the minds of the labourers, and have, too, brought them and the farmers into a closer union with each other. Having said so much with respect to the association, I hope, as it is now the fashion on occasions like the present, to refer to what is going on in India, you will allow me without at all trenching upon politics to address to you a few words upon that important subject, concerning as it does the safety of so many of our brave countrymen, their wives, and children. These men have at this moment the greatest possible claim upon us, but I am afraid we do not think of it with that seriousness with which we ought to do, and here I must say that I do not think that Government baa been at all up to the mark in providing a force adequate to crush this unha,rpy revolt. They should have at once caUed out the M'tla, and have made every man, high or low, rich or por, assist in the defence of the country. As I before saai, we ought to have the ballot, and each one, young or old, on whom the lot might fall, should be required to join the MUitia, or, if he could not serve himself, he should be required to find a man to serve in his place. This, as a matter both of policy and economy, should be done at one move, and not by driblets, as that would cost a great deal more money. Now, it occurs to me that we have been pampering the Indian army as contradistinguished from the Indian people; and what has been the result ? We did not find the people of India, bhut the men whom we have been paying and treating with every indulgenoe, rise and massacre our men, women, and children. Why was it we kept up that army? I shall tell you. It was for the sake of aggression, to add one province to another, that so we might become the eole possessors of India. That was, I think, the very worst policy we could have pursued, aud the next worst policy was to put arms in the hands of our enemies, which they are now turning upon ourselves. It would have been better if we had had the policeman rather than the soldier in India. We should never have allowed the native troops to have been numerically stronger than the European; but instead of that we had three native regiments to one European. The man was not in his senses who established that Bystem. Again, with what kind of men did we officer those troops? With young men of inexperience and uppishness-men not having that kindliness of human nature which would lead them to make allowance for the difference of country, colour, and of creed, and who consequentlv kept away from the native officers, and so made themselves disagreeable. (Hear, hear.) What I think is this-we should officer the native regiments by men who understand their feelings, for a touch of nature makes all mankind one kindred. (Cheers.) It is, too, better that we should, as soon as the insurrection is suppressed, rule in the name of the Queen only than as heretofore, having the East India Company stepping in between the subject and the Imperial authority of the Crown. Speaking of the suppression of the mutiny, I must confess that I cannot agree with those who say that we ought without mercy to sacrifice the principal cities of India, The Christian religion teaches us mercy, and therefore, although the Sepoys have no right to expect the least mercy at our hands, let us not, by imitating their conduct, sanction their barbarity. Let us be above that, and show that the Christian religion forbids us to take into our hands that vengeance which belongs to God alone. (Cheers.) It has, however, been said that Parliament will soon be called together, and thar it will be then determined what our future policy on the Government of India is to be; but I shall tell you wihat in reality will be done. A few old stagers, much better acquainted with red tape than with what concerns the government of the people, will be appointed to inquire into the cause of the revolt; but we may expeot nothing of any moment from their deliberations. (Hear, hear.) I feel I have somewhat wandered from the toast of the evening, but, as it is now everywhere the fashion to speak of India, I have also ventured to do so, and beg leave to thank you for the attention with which you have listened to my observations, In conclusion, I give you " Prosperity to the Hickmansworth Agricultural Association," and I beg leave to couple with that toast the name of my friend on my left, Mr. Herbert Fellowes, who originated the association, and whose talents and energy have kept it in existence, and who, I am sure, will never flinch from it. Earlier in the day the hon. gentleman delivered the prizes for ploughing, farm produce, &c., and in addressing the agricultural labourers he said that the judges having made their award, it devolved upon him to say to them a few words. They said, from the length of time which the judges had occupied in deciding upon the relative merits of each piece of ploughing, how difficult was the task they had to perform. It was one of the results of such institutions that they improved not only the way of conducting the plough, but they also improved the relation between the fa=m labourers and the farm. They were, he was sure, a happy lot of men, although they might have some hard worktoperform; but they should bear in mind that he and his friends had also their hard work to perform; so that probably the labourers were, as a clams, as happy as the gentry. He was happy to see 8o many of the labouring classes present, but he wished to remind them that it was for their owvn interest that the crime of the country should cease, for it was they who had in the long run to pay for it. If the conduct of the people were improved, and if there were less pauperism throughout the country, the labourers would reap the principal benefit from the change, and not the higher classes, as they might have supposed. The welfare of the labouring classes was a matter of the greatest importance to the gentry, for it was impossible to improve their condition without benefiting society at large. It might be that the prizes which the association offered, in order to bring about that result, were small ; but it was not the mere money value of the prize, but its moral importance, which they were to regard. He felt a pleasure meeting so many of his neighbours who were engaged in the most important of all manufactures-the manufacture of corn for the food of the people-and be felt happy in congratulating those who had obtained prizes by their skill in its pursuit. Even those who had not been on that occasion successful might well be proud of what they had exhibited, for any man who would unidertake to pronounce upon the several merits of each piece of ploughing in that field would have to look over it foravery long time indeed. He could then fairly congratulate both the successful and the unsuccessful upon the result of the day; and be hoped that next year would show a stiUl greater improvement in their work, and that those who were not now successful would compete again. He now came to speak of those servants wbo had kept their places for a long time under one master. It was, no doubt, gratifying to find the servants so weU conducted as to be able to retain their places for such a length of time as 40 years, but still he did not set much value upon it, because he liked to see a man rise from being a servant and become himself a niaster, instead of stopping so long in one place. (HIear, hear.) He was glad to find that the servant-maids did not stop so long in service, the longest period being four years, but got married, and were. he had no doubt, comfortable and happy. (Laughter.) With regard to the vegetables exhibited, he might say that they were indeed very excelent, and did great credit to the cottagers' gardens. He wished, however, to see the labourer's cottage and the labourer close to each other, so that he might devote his spare time to gardening, which could not be the case if, after his day's regular work, he had to walk two or three miles from his home to the little piece of land given to him to cultivate. He spoke in the presence of the farmers, and he hoped they would do something inthat direction by giving their labourers small alUotments for gardens adjoining their cottage^. When Parliament was prorogued the members were told to go down to tho country and exert themselves in promoting the happiness of the people. If he had been of any use to thom on the present occasion they might command him on any other. ec bad a large manufactory of paper in that neighbourhood, eAnd he therefore had something to do with the employment of the people, whosetabour he required in conducting the business of it. That was now the only rural manufacture which remained to them, and was. too, the onlz one to overlook~t which they saw tbe exciseiman come in at the doer; whereas, were the trade free, they could make paper for the whole of the world. Seeing the length of time tbey had been upon the ground, he would not further detain them, but thank them for the pleasure which he felt in meeting them. (Cheers.)

SIzIrnnZEIA STAB.LNG CASES.-LiVERPOOL, Oct. 6. -The inquest on the body of John Drowery, of No. .s7 E, Block Dock Cottages, Birkenhead, was opened yesterday evening before Mr. Churton, county coroner, but no evidence was taken. The coroner ordered a post morterz examinatioi to be made, and the inquiry was adjourned until Thursday. This afternoon the prisoners Francis Smith, Peter GaUagher, and John Smith, lodging at the cottages were taken before the ilirkenhead magisltrates. There was a lengthened examination, bet no evidence was adduced ealculated to throw additional light on the commission of the outrage beyond that previausly asoertained. A lazge bowie-knlfe, supposed to be tbhe property of Smith, was found near the body, the blade covened with blood, and the clothes of the prisoners were also str.ned with beod. They were again remanded. Theother woA ded Doan, Jon Dunn, remains at the Birkenhead Hcspit41, and hopee are now entertained of his ultimate ineevary.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The other day I met with the foUowing passage in an articlo in your able contemporary the Examiner, on the Indian mutinies:- " As to the atrocities and, treacheries perpetrated by the rebels in the course of the insurrection, history, or at least European history, assuredly affords nothing paraUel to them." Just at the same tiuie I read your reply to the demand of Cardinal Wiseman for an spology for his sermon, wherein you refer to his " sneer at Piedmont ;" and in that and in a subsequent article on his pastoral *ddress you administer a wel-deserved reproof, and give him some exceUent advice- But is there no paraUlel, Sir, for this dark page, and may not this word " Piedmont" suggest the answer ? The time was, and, alas, not long ago, in this world's history, when ?,tilton thus addressed the people of England:- " ON THE LATE MASsACRE LIZ PIsMaO0T." Avenge, 0 Lord. tby slaughtered aints whose bones *- Ie rcatter'd In the Alpine mountain cold - "Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old, When aU our fathers wor,hipt stooks and stones, "Forgetnot: In Thy book reoord theIr groas "Who were Thy theep, and In their antlent told Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rol d *Mother with Infant down the rocks. Their moans The rales redoubled to the hills, and they "To Heaven. Tbeir mart,red blood and athes Bow o'er all the Italian fields, where stUl doth sway The triple tyrant; that from thee may grow "A hundred fold, who, havnDg learn'd Thy way, EArly may fly the Babylonian woe." I fear there is not an atrocity of the Indian revolt which has not its parallel In that dreadfal persecution. Todd, in his notes on this sonnet, tells us that " it occurred in 1655, in an attempt of the Dukeof Savoy to compel his reformed subjects to embrace Popery or quit the country. All who remained and refused to be converted, with their wives and children, suffered a most barbarous massacre." Cromwell was appoaled to; he instantly commanded a general fast, and prornoted a national subscription, heading it himself with 2,0001. There are several State letters in his name in Milton's prose works, and one of them to the Dake of Savoy. Owing to Cromwell's interference the persecution -was stopped, the Dake recalled his army, and the surviving inhabitants were reinstated in their cottages, and allowed the peaceable exercise of their religion. I do not seek to revive the recollections of these atrocities; my object Is to commend the spirit of the appeal of Milton to his countrymen, to be grateful that the seed then sown appears now to be bearing fruit in Piedmont, though somewhat to the disgust of the Cardinal, and to show my fellow-countrymen the example theo set of a national humiliation and national eflort for the relief of the sufferers. From another source I find the sum total then raised was 38,0971. 7s. 3d., of which Cromwell subscribed 2,0001.; the cities of London and Westminster, 9,3841. 6s. Ild. - " the particular gifts of several persone, 1,7351. 2s. ;" and the other contributions are stated from the several counties of England and Wales, Yorkshire, with 484 parishes, contributlngl,7S6C.; Suffolk, 401 parishes, 1,1841. ; Middlesex, 9501. 6s. ld., for 62 parishes Essex, with 379 parishes, 1,5121. 17s. The highest in Wales was Glamorgan, 106 parishes, 160L; the lowest in England was WVestmoreland, 37 parishes, 631. iSs.; and in Wales Rad.aorshire, 6 parishes, 11. 14s. 4d. From these items I presume the collections were made ia the parishes from house to house, and probably in the churches. The subscription was deservedly called "the Great Subscription," and, looking to the period and the different value of money, certain,ly presents to us a noble example. Cromwell sent a commissioner to Geneva, Sir Samuel Moreland, and the money appears to have been most honestly distributed. I am, Sir. vour obedipnt m nvvt c. Uctooer 6.
