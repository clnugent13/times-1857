ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. The groat musical event of the year, the first perform=co of Don Giovanni, took place last night, and drew, according to traditional custom, the aoist crowded and brilliant audience of the season. The cast, with two exceptions, w3s the same as In 156. The first exception was important, since it applied to Douna .Anna, which magnificent personage was once more embodied by Madame Grisi, who, while she can aot, sing, and look the part as she does now, ought not to think of resigning it to any other performer. The transposition of the grand dramatic air, ".Or sai che r'indegno," is of little moment, when the earnest and passionate manner in which Grisi narrates to the perplexed OttnviQ the history of Anna's wrongs and the unworthy conduot of Giovaunt is taken into account. Nor can any. thing be more intensely affecting than the grief of Donna Anna over the body of her murdered father, into the portraYal of which Grisi enters heart and soul, and the burst of anguish with which she addresses her lover in the succeeding duet, " Fuggi, crudele," one of the most exprez. sive pieces in the whole of Mozart's great masterpiece. The other variation from the distribution of last year was of scarcely inferior consequence. Mario once more resumed tho part of Don Ottavlo, which he rescues from its inherent insipidity by the manly and graceful demeanour which distinguishes his impersonat ion throughout. His great vocal display, the unequalled air "It inio Tesoro," was, as always, a triumph of expressive singing combined with a command of the florid style of vocalization in which Mario has had very few compeers. His share in the duet with Donna Anna, after the murder of her father, was equally dimirable. But why such a singer should per. petualy ignore such a song as "fDa22a sua pace" it is difficalt to explain, Madomoiselle Mara! exhibited her accstomed intelligence as the melancholy Elvira, who never appears but to be disdained by her profligate lord, or turned into ridicule by his unscrupulous servant -for which the sympathy of others who have suffered less than herself from the same unworthy source affords but Poor consolation. The difficult air, "lMi tradi quell' alma ingrata," was executed by this young lady with the facility and cloverness for which she has more than once been praised. Madame Bosio's Zerlina, in the progress of years, has grown into somethiug which, if not absolutely perfect, apProaches perfection so nearly as almost to disarm criticism, No one alive to the influence of pure and exquisite melody can listen with indifference to Madame Bosio's delivery of " Batti, batti," and " Vedrai carino," which but for one or two unnecessary and not effective changes would be quite faultless; nor can any one fail to note with satisfaction, in the charmingly natural byplay with which she accompanies both these incomparable airs, the sensible advance which she has been recently making in the histrionic department of her profession. Formerly Maadame Bosio's Zerlina and Madame Bosio's Violetta, but for the essential difference suggested in the music, would have been personages of much the same calibre; but this highly accomplished vocaliat now possesses the art of endowing with individuality the characters she assumes, which imparts an additional and a very ively attmcgion to her performance. Madame Bosio was encored unaniconsly both in " Batti, batti," and "Vedrai carino," and, if she could he made to understand that the enthusiasm of the audience was raised at least as much by Mozart's beautiful music as by her own finished singing, she would refrain henceforth from indulging in those liberties which it is our duty to condemn. Mozart's melody cannot be iniproved. Herr Formes made his first appearance for the season on the present occasion, and could not have renewed acquaintance with the patrons of the Royal Italian Opera under more favourable circumstances, since, as we bave frequently insisted, Loporello is one of those characters into which the German bass enters most thoroughly, and which show to the best advantage his qualifications as a dramatic singer. Iis conception, though it may differ in many points from that generaUy accepted among Italians, is the only true one; and how much the altered behaviour of Leporello in the last scenes-where Herr Formes, with the genuine spirit of an artist, rejects all temptations to excite laughter at the expense of dramatic probability-adds to the effect of the solemn and impre8sive musio by which Mozart has illustrated tbem, we need scarcely remind those who regard Don Giovanni as something of loftier purport than can attach to the meaning of a bond fide comic opera. The terrible climax is rendered doubly imposing by this absence of buffoonery; and In place of a grotesque farce a grave and edifying lesson is presented for the consideration of the audience. Herr Formes, at the same time, would do well to get the dialogue-recitatives more perfectls into his head. By these mneans, if nothing elsa, he would place the representative of his noble and rascally patroa, whoever that might happen to be, considerably nuore at ease. Htow ofton shaU we have the ungrateful task of insisting that Ronconi-who can embody almost every range of obaracter, from an emperor to a peasant-is altogether ont of his element in Don Giovanni ? It is not precisely that this variously gifted artist is unable to put on the semblance of a geatleman, since as Count 5ha]ais (in Afaria di RBohan1) no one will dispute that he leeks "every inch" a gentleman. It is not that the music puzzles him-since his voice, though of inferior quality, is emarkable for hlexibility, and he is a thorough master of the vocal art, It is not that his stature is short, since there are moments in several of his tragic delineations when he strides before the footlights as a giant. Where, then, ate we to searcl for the reason of that utter absence of dramatic illusion which characterizes his portrayal of the Spanish libertine ? The argument that there is now no Don (liovanni on the stage, and has not been one since Tamburini-who, if we may believe frequenters of the opera in earlier days (laudatorcs tenmporis acti), himself was far from the ideal personage-is hardly of weight enough to Dmake us accept Ronconi, who, with aU his art and extraordinary intelligence, fails in every sense to realize our notion of the character. A much stronger would be, that, in the absence of Ronconi, we must put up with the loss of Don Giovanni altogether, unleas the management persuaded lario to essay the pyart. Either alternative, however, would be lamentable, since it is scarcely worse to deprive the lyric stage of the grandest wasterpiece of dramatic music than to present that masterpiece in such a tortured shape as to suit the capabilities of a register of voice for which the music of the hero was not written. That Ronconi, in spite of his great gifts, can never be the legendary Don Giovanni, of whom every opera frequenter entertains a certain indefinite notion, is beyond a cdoubt ; but, Ds there is no other member of tbh Royal Italian opera comnpany with a chance of making even a tolerable figure in the part, we Jnust be content to accept hihu with all his defects, or bid adieu to a work which would have inimortalized Mozart had he composed no other and which has maintained its position unrivalled for'threequarters of a century. In the ball scene(finate toAct I.) the minuet was danced by Madame Cerito and M. Desplaeos. The opera was received with rapture from begining to end, and, besides the encores we have mentioned, the mask trio in the birst fnzale (beautifully sung by Madamne Grisi, Signor Ilario, and MIademoiselle Mlarsi) wasrepeated. But for these absurd and unreasonable demands on the part of the audience the opera might have terminated a little befor: midnight.
TBtiAL AND CONVICTION FOrt FORtGxY.-At the Iligh Court of Justiciarv, Edinburgh, on Monday, Josepb Manning Wilson, lately a rnerchant in Leith, was charged with forgery and utteTing six forged bills of exehange, to the amnount in all of 2,3451. 1Ss. 4d., between October 18.55 and January 1856. About the sarae period several other bib forgeries wvere coninxitted in Leith, and a merchant there nained Jacob Christiansen vas apprehended and convicte6 in connexion with them in May, 185(, and sentenced to be transported for life. Wilson had, in February or March. 18;,G. been examined by the Procurator-Fiscal in regard t. the forgeries then creauting so uch uneasiness in LeithI but there was l o evidence sllieient to detain him, and soon afterwards he absconded and took ship for Australia. In his absence he was indicted for trial, and on not appearing was outlawed by the High Court in May, 18S6. He was at length, however, apprehended at Folkestone in November last by the superintendent of the Leith police, Mr Grant, having just come ashore in a small boat from the vessel in the Channel, and awaiting the ooportuanity to proceed to America or the continent. The bills of wbich he was charged with the forgery were :-1. A bill for 2471. 2s., dated Leith, the 18th of October, 185, purporting to he drawn by J. Wilson and Co,, and accepted payable with Messrs. Coutts and Co., London, by Julius iLittre. Konigsberg; 2. A bill dated the 5th of Novemiber for 29GI. 4s ntd., dravwn by the sarme upon F. Schbell, Pillau, also payable at Contt-s's; 3. A bill for 4701., dated the 8th of November, 185S. written in German, payable to the order of Messrs. J. Wilson and Co., bearing to be drawn by Julius Zi.ttre. and accepted by iMr. George Geipel, Hartle- oo; 4. A bill tor 7401. 8s. 4d., dated the 15th of Novem- ber, drawn by J- Wilson and Co., and appearing to be accepted hyL.auritz hluller,-Esq.. lKongsberg; * . A bill for 4001., wfritten in German, dated the 7th of Decetnber, pay. able to the order of J. Wilson and Co., purporting to be signed Julius Ziittre, and to be accepted by Messrs. Holbech and Somer, Hamburg; and, 6th, a bill for 1861. 3s. 7d., dated L.eith, 1st of January, 1850, slgned by J. Wilson and Co., as drawvers, and bearing to be accepted by F. Sehnell, Fa.cq, Pillau. The prisoner was also accused of having uttered all the above bills at the office of the NMational Bank, Leith, and having had the same discounted. AUl these bills were protested by the parties by whom they purported to be accepted; the signatures un them, bearing to be per procuration of their firms, were discovered to be altogether fictitious, No trcnsactions could be found on the prisoner's books with which theforged bills had connexion, and various witnesses were called to prove the forgery and uttering of the six bills by the prisoner, including the Mayor of Pillau end several other foreigners. After a trial of eight hours the jury brought in a verdict of Guilty, and the prisoner was sentenced to transportation for the period of his natural life. COUNTY CESS IN lItELAND.-A Bill of Mr. Attorney-General for Ireland and Mr. Massey enacts that the provisions of the Act 11th and 12th Victoria, cap. 32, see. 2, relative to the collection of county aess in Ireland shall be revived and continued up to the end of the year 1859. Justices may take security for collectors, and the Lord-Lieutenant muay appoint any person to collect the charges and exoensesof an additional forco of constabulary.

THE ART TREASUBES EXHIBITION. Monday was a wet and extremely unfavourable day, and the attendance at the Exhibition fel off to 5,497 visitors, of whom 4,919 paid Is. for admission and 578 had season tickets. Of the visitors 1,563 arrived by railway. There were three railway excunion trains-one from Wellington by the Shrewsbury Railway, one from the Potteries by the North Staffordshire line, and another from Preston, Bury, and other places by the East Lancashire Railway. These trains, however, brought very few passengers. Yesterday the weather was again unfavourable, and the attendance limited. About 4,300 hadentered at 3 o'clock. The great coffee saloon erected by Mr. Donald,430 feet long, fromthe secondclass refreshment-room and railway corridor, parallel with the south side of the Art Treasures Palace, has now been connected with the south transept by a short corridor, and is a great improve. mnent as well as addition to the comfort and convenience of viitors. it is well lighted by windows on either side, and is so constructed that the canvass covering can be thrown back on a fine day, so as to admit of great er ventilation and light. This really fine and spacious saloon, the western end of which is fitted up with stalls as a first-class confectionery room, is capable of being turned to great advantages on occasion, so as to relieve the other parts of the building when overcrowded. It might, for instance, be used for flower-shows. which at Manchester are always very attractive in themselves, or as a promenade. The corridor leading from it into the transept is being fittted up with tapestry, mirrors, stained glass, and statuary.
SPOBTING INTELLIGENCE. ASCOT RACES.-TUESDAY. Sunshine and fair weather were suddenly followed by dark, lowering] clouds, and before the afternoon was far advanced a drenlching rain fell. ThiB unpropitious change in the skiey indlaences was su'idcient to deter many intending lady visitors from making the trip to Ascot, and to induce others to reserve themselves for Thursday-the " Cup Day"-when Her Majesty and Court will be present. StilL the Heath was numerously attended; the effect of the railway on the gathering was, however, apparent in the comparatively scanty muster of vehicles and the increased number of pedestrians. The Grand Stand was crowded, and, notwithstanding the inclement weather, the assmblage of ladies was perhaps scarcely below the average. In the Queoens Stand and private stands were many fashionable vlsitors, but we shall reserve our list of distinguished persons until the " Cup Day." Underthe active superintendence of the Earl of Bessborough the arrangements for carrying out the business of the meeting are-as they invariably re at Ascot-of the most efficient description. The radng, it wil be seen from the appended detailed account, was marked byJncidents of much present interest and prospeotive importance. The success of Arsenal over Strathnaver caused the old question of " Who was second for the Derby?" to be revived, while the horse was mrch talked about aiterwards in connexion with the St. Leger, for which eyent 20 to 1 would have been taken about him Clydesdale, the winner of the Biennial Stakes, is likely to play an important part in the Derby betting of 1858. Altogether the racing was in favour of the fielders, " the Stakes" being carried off by a veritable outsider, Claude Lorraine, who was backed for small sums only at prices ranging between100toB and 100 to6. The races were decidedas under:- The TRAL STAIs of 6sovs. eacb, with 50 added. New mile. 18 subs. Mr. T. Walker's The Early Bird, by Birdeatcher, G yrs, 9ft. 31b. (D. Hlughes) ... . I Mr. T.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE. All the arrangements for the Handel Festival-from the great organ down to provisioning the Chorus, from getting ready tons of music-books to painting whole acres of stands for them-are on the most extensive Ecale. A bewildering expanse of seats, from A to Z 24, is provided for sitting accommodation; and visitors are instructed to set down at the south and take up at the north, and wait at the east and movetothe west,as If a pocket-compass were an indispensable adjancttoall complete toilettes,or as if ourmodern charioteers drove rather by the PolesaAr than the rules of the road. Nevertheless, though like all technical arrangements they are dry reading and seem rather abstruse upon paper, the deta{iL are in reality so simple and have been so effectively organized, that if only carried out asintendednone will have cause to complain, and the rules for the aocommodation of visitors arelikely to become models andprecedents for future gatherings. In an especial manner has attention been devoted to perfecting the arrangements connected with the commissariat department of the Festival. From a variety of causes, this most important feature in all places of public amusement has not yet taken that prominence which the high character of the Palace itself demands. MIanagers have looked upon the Exhibition too much as a vehiole for the inculcation of high art, and have neglected to afford facilities for the supply of those creature comforts without which every Exhibition becomes a bore. It is sad, but not the less true, that bitter ale is essential to the study of ancient art. Who visits the Greek Court without wishing to resort to congenial ioes ? and of 'what avail are the suggestive dishea of the Ceramic ware, if fowls and tongue are not at hand? The Crystal Palace should be, in fact, what it is not now even in theory-the first cafi in Europe-a plae which visitos would no more think of leaving without dining at than they now think of quitting London without having seen. It appears astonishing that in a country which at all events has the reputation of beiDAg peculiarly sensitive on such points this important matter should have been overlooked, but it is nevertheless true; and directors, with a wonderful dis. regard of their interests, have hitherto limited Mr. Staples to. counter space at which not 400 people could be served. Even now, perhaps, it may surprise them to leara that hungry visitors do not regard a bust from the antique as a satisfactory equivalent for sandwiches, or look with friendly eyes upon a colossal statue occupying a space which,properly laid out, would have supplied them all with ices and lemonade. The same misjudging spirit also excludes the best dining saloons from the building,entirely, and the result is gloomy apartments, something like hospital wards, only not so airy. Visitors come down to dine at the Crystal Palace, and when there find they do not get the very thing for which they came. The entertainments which can be laid in these 8alles-&maanger are bat poor sets-off to their funerealI aspect, about as fatal to joviality as if the waiters were mutes and the place itself a vault. Surely the directors have no excnse for this. With a prospect from the building and with gardens around it which can com pare with anything of the kind in Europe, is it not a great misake solemnly and amid a pomp of waiters to inter the diners. out in a long, close room, from which they can see or enjoy about as much of the Paace as it they were under water9 That most D}-used, much-payinag, and easily-pleased cosmopolite-the publiec-has a right to better treatment than this, and so also has Mr. Staples, who yearly pays an enormoun rental for accommodation which he does not get and facilities which are only nowbeginning to be allowed. Let the directors look weU into these arrangements; they are worth their best consideration, for we are convinced that if a complete system of refreshments adapted to first, second, and tbird.class visitors, were well carried out, it would with less expense contribute more to the profit of the shareholders and general success of the company than any plan yet devised. Already we are glad to say the matter is exciting attention, and we sincerely trust that before the end of this season the arrangements for refreshments in all parts of the building will be, on a scale as satisfatory to tho public as it undoubtedly wil bo remunerative to the company. For the Handel Festival a very liberal allowance has been made of counter space. No less than 1,600 visitors can now at once set down to dinner, and, in addition, 2,000 can be served at counters; draught bitter ale will be served everywhere, and ices, quarter bottles of sherry, with glass, and packets of biscuits, will be ready for instant delivery at the intervals between the programme. If the public wish to assist in making these arrangements as comfortable as posBible, let them not neglect to provide themselves with silver, as three or four people are always kept waiting while a fifth is getting his sovereign's change. One word morm and wo heve finished our suggestions. With whom, we should like to know, rests the duty of watering the roads leading from Dal wich to the Palace? Some one is at fault here, for the visitor has generally to drive through a simoom that is perfectly suffocatng, andforanevi whichis so annoying while the remedy is so simnple no excuse can be found. As if in derision of the sufferings of visitors, the wretched little toDlgate now in the enjoyment of receipts unknown to any " pike " in the United Kingdom has just stuck up a notice that a half oenny extra will be charged for " watering." What an aggravating issult this becomies to half-blinded parties who can just distinguish the satirical announrcement through clouds of dust I It is really too bad, when the receipts from this tollgate must keep all the roads in the parish in repair, that those who are compeled to pay should have to endure a nuisance whicb, unless speedily put an. end to, even -the attractions of the Palace will not induce people to fac Thi5 M ImS.--SoumEA?ToN, Tuesday.-The RoYIalMail Company's steamship Avon, Captain Revett, sailed to-day for Lisbon and the Brazils, with the Brazilian and River Plate rnails, 60 pasengers, 800!. in specie, jewelry value .30,0001., and a full cargo.

!FE WAR IN PERSIA. INDIA BOARD. .Twr R (From the London Gaote of Tnn. Qa The following notification, issued by the GovernorGeneral of India in Council on the 22d of Api, 1857, has been this day received at the East Indiahouse:- "INOTrFICATION. " Fort Willam, April 22, 1857. "It is with great satisfaction that the Governor, General in Council directs the publication of the accompanying despatches* received from the seat of war in Persia. They describe fully the operations of the British sea and land forces in the attack and capture of Mohammerah on the 26th of March, the flight of the Persian army, 13,000 strong, and the complte success of the British arms at every point. "' The scheme of the attack was chosen by Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram with excellent judgment; it was carried through with steady precision; and it has led to the accompLishment of the object ia view at a small cost of life. The GovernorGeneral in Cuncil desires to offer to LieutenantGeneral Sir James Outram his best congratulations aLd thanks for this happy result. "The engagement was on the aide of the British ams a naval one, no land force, with the exception of one mortar battery, having taken an active sbare in it. The manner in which the task wasperformed is most honourable to tie Indian navy. " That the oficers, seamen, artillerymen, marines, and others of the squadron did their duty with intrepidity and ardour is the smallest part of the lraiBe which is owing to them. The plan of the naval attack, which was to be carried out in shoal and narrow waters, and in a rapid current, by steamers of heavy draught, some of them encumbered with vessels in tow, and the thoroughly smccessful execution of every part of it withouit miscarriage or confusion of any kind, in the face of strong defensive works at point-blank range, have given proof of a cool judgment, a well-ordered discipline, and a sklful management, of which Commodore Young and the officers and men under his command may well be proud. " The cordial thanks of the Government of India are eminently due to Commodore Young and to those who shared that day's work with him; and the Governor-General in Council wil have pleasure in expressing to the Hon. Court of Directors his hearty approbation of the conduct of all concerned. It wil be his agreeable daty to bring to the epcial notice of Her Majesty's Government and of the Ron. Court of Directors the meritoriour. services of those whom Commodore Young has named in his despatches of the 27th of March "The disembarcation of the troops above the forts took place under the able direction of Brigadier-General Havelock, C.B., rapidly and im good order; but before the landing was effected success was already complete. The whole Penrian army was in full retreat, leaving in our hands 17 pieces of orclna&ce, their tents, baggage, stores of all kinds and large magazines of ammunition and provisions: An accarate return of casualties has not yet been received. Theme were conEned to the squadron and it is believed that the number does not exceed 6 killed and 30 wounded. It is e.timated that the enemy lost 200 killed. "For the judicious arrangements by which the troops were held in readiness, and their landing facilitated, the thanks of the Government of India are due to the officers of the General Staff, aAd to the other staf and regimental officers indicated m Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram's despatch. The Governor-General in Council will not fail to call the attention of Her Majesty's Government and of the Hon. Court of Directors to the zeal and exertions of these officers, as also to the asistance rendered to Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram by the officers and others Berving on his staff. "T The Governor-General in Council cannot close this notice of the operations at Mohammerah without tendering his thanks to the commanders and crews of the transports engaged on this occasion. The alacrity with which a dangerous service, far beyond their atrict ob'ations, waa undertaken, and the courage and skill with which it was performed, entitle the officers and men of those vessels to the best acknowledgments of the Government of India. "By order of the Right Hon. the GovernorGeneral in Council "G. F. hDHONSTONB, Secrey to the Government of India." Fablished in the Londn Gac of the l5th of MAy 1857, pages 1,722 to 1,780.

CHINA. (FROM OUP. OWN COBIBSPONDXNT., HONGKONG, Arirpr 25. I had searcely posted my last letter when a vague report of a serious cAualty to Her Ma.. jestysship IRaleigh reached Hongkong. In the course of the day, but after the departure of the mail, the rumour became oertainty and the Circun - stances asoertained. It is a sa affair, indeed, tot only for thegallant Commodore e eppel, of Chinese and Crimean renown), but also for the war. Until the court-martial sits and gives sentence it will be unfair to everybody to blame or aoquit anybody,.-all thst I can Bay is, that Hera*esty's ship Raleigh is lost to tho service. She was bowling along the dangerous cot in the Vicinity of Macao on the 14th inst. when she struck upon a rock not laid down on any chart, but the same upon which Her Mjesty's ship Clio struck long ago. HIer port bow was nearly stove in by the shock, but the pumps were set going with a will, and in six hours more she was snug in the mud at the mouth of the Typa, the harbour of cMaeo. It is characteristic of the man that, immediately before " beaching" her, and with the water up to the lower decks, Captain Eeppel mluted with 21 guns the Virginie and Catinat, F rench men-of-war lying in the Macao roads. Frin them I need not say, as well as from the ships of the British squadron in these Seam, he has received every assistance possible, vain as that will most likely prove to be. On tha other hand, the Portuguese are in ecstacies at the calamity which has befallen the man who of yore violated the Macao territory to give liberty, in a solnewhat irregular way, to n inprioned British subject. All her guns have been taken out of her and brought up to Hongkong. Everything has been done to lighten her short of pulling her to pi6oes But there she lies embedded in 10 feet of mud at the least, with 20 feet, and more, of the same mate. rial inside of her, and a heavy beating sea jamming her faster and faster into the beach. She is perfectly inmovable. There cau bo no doubt that ahe will be blown up. Yet, Captain Keppel, they say, thinks better of her chance, and even offers to bet pay and allowances that he will get her safe into Hongkong harbour. I regret to say that he is the I only naval authority who entertains such an opinion. There have been no other arrivals since my last. The gunboats that were then inJava are probably now at Singapore, but we have no intelligence on this point. Ourenemies are as aive as ever. Since the departure of the last mai a plot against the lives of Colonel Caine (the Lieutenant-Governor) and Mr. Caldvell (the Registrar and Interpreter-General) has been discovered, and one of the conspirators, the " head watchman" of Stanley, was on the 17th inst. taken into custody. His chief accomplice, the " Tepo," or headborough, of the same place, has fled; but one or two more will be apprehended, I am told, to-morrow, and the trials of the gang will take place this week. They are charged with high treason. A document, found in the possession of the "head watchman" on his apprehension, ought to convict hin at least, and to furnish the clue to evidence which shall hang the rest. It is a letter from 'Tsan-kwei-tsikl himself, the Corypheus of murder and arson and kidnapping, who left Canton three months ago for Shanon,inthisneighbourhood, wwitha commisMionto leadYeh's " braves " in every enterprise against the barbarian English. The writer tells the "head watchman" and the " Tepo,"-for it is addrelsed to both,-that they are at liberty to accept help from any quarter, even from the illegal Trimds and other Secret Societies of Chinese, so thxt they accomplish their work, and earn the reward' for dging it. That work is the taking of the " heads of Colonel Caine and Mr. Caldwel1,"-rwhich done, he says, the rest may be massacred at leisure; for those two are the only mem. bers of Governmuent who " understand anything." As I nzognosticated inay last, the exchange of prisoners took place on the 18th inst., and the murderer of Air. MIarkwick is now in custody. It is a whimsical illustration of Chinese character that, on his surrender by the Chinese authorities, the latter presented a petition from the murderer's mother, stating that she, understanding that 500 dollars were offered for him, was led tg hope that the sum might be paid over to her, as he was her only son and means of support. It wax explained to the authorities that no other compensation but the surrender of their hstage could be admitted. He has implicated two others as principals but they cannot be found. Three more also at large are said to have been present. You will find it easy to surmise the inspiration to the deed when I tell you that in searching for treasonable papers in the premises of the head watchman aud those of another of the conspirators3 in the former case part of the property stolen from the murdered man's house wag found, together with a note from the murderer, dated from Shanou, and requesting the sid head watchman to Convert a portion of the same into money and hold it for the writgr's use. There was examined to-das1 at the police-station, by the superintendent of police, Mr. May, a Portuguese sailor called Joz6 Maria. He is but 10 days returned after a two or three months' captivity at Lantao and the Bocca Tigris, to which places he was carried a prisoner in Jannary last upon the capture of his lorcha by the Imperialist forces. Hi statement is not uninteresting. During the whole time that he was in prison he was frequently called upon by the mandarins to inspect the heads which the "braves," some of whom he well knew as boatmeu of Hongkong, brought in from Hongkong, Whampoa, and C i-moon, and to say whether they were or were not European heads. There vere about a score of such, including " two old ones with white hair." The children used to drag them about and play with them during the investigation. If it ended satisfactorily the claimant received 150 taels of silver for each head, with an order for the like sum on the arrival of the head at Canton. One of his crew having died in prison of a wound the mandariu ordered his ears to be cut off beforeburial, "for," said he, " I shallbe able now to detect any man who may dig him up and try to impose the dead man's head upon me as a fresh one and claim the reward." There were said to be about 30 Europeans in the Canton prison, including old MIr. Cowper. It is difficult to understand by what influence the Governor of Macso obtained the release of Joz7 Maria. When the man himself claimed protection as a Portuguese subject one mandarin said, "We are at war with all nations," and another, "You and the English are Chrisans all the same," and a third, " You are a white man." But released he is, and aU his company, and by the intercession of the Governor of Macso. Of or from the rebels I have little to add to my last advices, but that little is important. They have taken up a strong position at Fatihan, a little above Canton, upon the same river, and are threatening that capital. Fatshan is the chief emporium of the Southern tea trade. The Iorthern tea trade is,!-ac cording to the last news from Shanghai and Foochow-foo, so completely in their hands that-'the remittances of treasure usually made at this seaon to the tea-hills from those two ports have been actually brought back by the Chinese merchauts to the foreign houses from which they had received them, declazing their inability to induce the people i to trade, "sbo great is the panic." I am also informed on good authority that another large city in Keangsi has fallen to the rebels, and-|I more pregnant proof of their good eatate-that the latter are "retaining and fortifying with walls" one of their recent acquisitions in the maritime province of Fbilden.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIME& Sir,-The Rev. Mr. Goldiej in a loeter Vhich appears n The 2lmesof to-day, say8 that my statement respecting the endowment of Colnbrook is 'quite incorrect." Now, what should we expect would follow this poitive aflegation? Should we not expect a denial of the faet that 1001. a-year had been left to Colnbrook, and that Mr. Townsend was either altogether a myth, or had left some very different sum to some very different place for somo very different object? Bat what do we really find? We find Mr. Goldie himself stating tht there is an endowed lectureship at olabrook. founaed and endowed by this very MIr. Townsend, and of, the exact yearly value I d stated. But then It was a lectureship, and not the incmnbLacy thlt was endoweed; ,nd we are told very emphatically that the 1001. in question " neither must, is, nor can be part of the endowment of Colabrook." Certainly not, while Mr. Goldie ig izcumbent, because he dooe not posse the nce.. sary qualification of being a Townsend Scholar. But let Colnbrook be vac4nt, and I will answer for it that, with a good hou, four acres of land, and 1001. a-year, there is many a Towsend Scholar who would be glad to bave it, and then the impossility of the 1001. a-year being part of the endowment vnishs at once.

Earl HOWE presented a petition from civil servants at Bristol against the present superannuation allo wances. Lord BEATTCaAtP presented a petition from the guardians of the Droitwich Union against the present mode of conducting the county expenditure. Viscount LIFFORD presented a petition from the inhabitants of Horsemonden, in Rent, against the repeal of hOe Oath of Abjuration. Lord BROUGHAM presented a petition from a gentlemani who, having mirried a Scotch lady at Gretna-green, and afterwards remarried her at St. George's, flanover. square, had, on the 3d of July, 184L, obtained a sentence of divorce in the Scotch Ecclesiastical Court, and nowv prayed t,heir Lordships that, as that divorce affeoted only the Scotch marriage, he might have a dissolution of the English marrla,e, which should take effect from the same date. Lord CAMPBELL expressed the opinion that the Scotch divorce vwas sufficient to dissolve both the marriages. Lord BROUGHAM vished he could take that view of the matter. Lord CARNARVON presented a petition from the parish of King's Stanley, in the diocess of Glocester and Bristol, praying that measures should be taken to preserve the existence of, and remove anomalies in, the present system of church-rates. THE MUTINIES IN INDIA. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-I was in hopes that it would not be necessary to draw your lordships' attention, ,even for a single moment, to the lamentable events which have recently taken place in India; but snore recent ancounts, which I only perused last night, have given so grave a character to the mutiniesa which have occurred in that -country that I cannot consistently with my duty abstain from asldng a question of the noble earl who represents the Government in this House. Such of your lordships as have attended to the recent aecounts from India must have read with much regret and pain the account of the mutiny of the 19th Regimenxt at Berhampore; yo mnust have watehed with great apprehension the march of that regi. ment to Barraokpore and its disbandment, nuder circamstanoes of the most perilous character, in the presence of five other native regiments,. You mnst have looked with apprehenslon at similar appearances of mutiny in the Madras and Bombay armies; but that which has most alarmed me, and which gives a more serious character to all these appearances of insubordination, is that which has only come to our -knowledge within the last few hours. I read in the latest accounts from India, that between the 16th and 25th of April there were seven incendiary fires, and that the 3d Regiment of Light Cavalry was in open mutiny. How it can be possible that a regiment having no mnore than 400 sabres could for one half-hour be in a state of open mutiny in the cantonment of Mfeerut is wbat I cannot compreLend. At that station there is, I believe, a force of 54 guns, 42 of European and 12 of native Artillery; there is a regiment of European cavalry, the Carabineers; a battalion of the 60th Regiment, Queen's troops; and two regiments of native infantry. The officer who commands that division had the means of putting' down any mutiny in half-an-hour. Open mutiny is open war, and it is to be maet only as open war carried on by an enemy in the field. I cannot but think ihat there must have been some strange misrepresentation and exaggeration in the accounts which we have received from India. I have, however, looked most carefally into all the statements which we have received as to thesa 2mutinies in the Bengal tarritory, and I can come to no other conclusion than that the source of aU that discontent nad mutiny is the apprehension that there is an intention on the part of the Govermment to interfere with the religion of the ratives. It is impossible to come to any other concltaion. Now, what has the Government done to put an end to that erroneous impression ? When the 19th Regiment was disbanded at Barrackpore there was a passage in a long official paper emanating from the Governor-General in Council, and read to the soldiery, which was to the effect that no one could pretend that the Government had at any time endeavoured to interfere with the religion of the people; bat I cannot find that any notification has been made, as it should have been, at the quarters of every regiment and throughout the country, of the determination of the Government to adhere to its ancient policy of respecting the feelings and prejudices of the natives. I see no trace of there having been any general notification to that effect. It has been left entirely to the officers at the different stations to make any such notifiastion as they should think fit under the circumstances. When the regiznent was disbanded at Barraokpoor General Hearney addressed it in terms which it is impossible to surpass in ressoning or in eloquence, and he afterwards addressed the -whole of the native infantry at that station, and I do not recollect ever to have read at any time or in any history, attributed to any general in command of an army, or to any statesman who had to administer the Government of an empiro, any oration more thoroughly reazonable, or more completely eloquent and convincing than the speech of General Iearsey addressed to the army on that occasion. (Hear, hear.) And what should the course of the GovernorGeneral hsv-e been ? Ought he not with his own hand in three sentences to have communicated to the whole country his cordial concurrence with everything which General Hearsey had said, and should henot havemadehis concurrence with that speech aspublio as the speech itself was necessarilymade throughout the country? Iam convinoed that if the GovernorGeneral bad pursued that course we should have heard no mnore of the mcendiary fires, nor of the open mutiny at hfeerat. But that course was not taken, and although I absolve the Government of India as a Government from any intention to interfere with the religion of the natives, l must say that there have been of late-and daily increasins of late-circumstances which were calculated to excite in the minds of the natives great apprehension upon that subject. I saw in a newspaper which I read yesterday the names of six or eight colonels, and of important persons in the civil addministration of the country high in office, mentioned as being connected with missionary operations, and tomy great astonishment-I can scarcely believe it now to be true, though I saw it distinctly stated in the papers-that the Governor-General himself, Lord Canning, largely subscribes to every society which has for its object the conversion of the natives. My lords, the Governor.General of India can do nothing in his individual capacity. (Hear, hear.) He cannot separate himself from his publio character as Governor-GeneraL H e is essentiaUly the Government of. the country. No one looks to anybody else. There may be others who think that they are of importance, but they are not. The only man looked to in India is the Governor.General. It is not in India alone, but more particularly in India, that it is generally understood that if a man at the head of the Government earnestly desires anything, it is his intention :to enforce his desire and to effect his purpose. I deem that fact of these suberiptions of Lord Canning, she Governor-General of India, to societies aving for their object the conversion of the natives, if at be true, to be one of the most dangerous things which -could have happened to the security of our government in India. We must maintain that government aswe have acquired it, by acting on the principles of Ackbar; but we cannot mamntain it by attempting to act on the principles of Aurungzsb. You may depend upon it that if persons 1olding high office in the Government of India, and, above all, at the head of the Government, are permnitted to act on this principle, and to indulge t4eirown personal feelings- do not doubt but they may be acting from conscientious motives-for the pur-pose of chnging the religion of the people, you will see the most bloody revolution which has at any hte occurred in India. The English will be expelled from India, and, expelled from that country, they wil not leave behind them a dozen sincere oonverts to Christianity. The question which I wish to put to the noble earl opposite is, whether instructions have been sent orwil forthwith be sent to India directing the differentGovernmentstomakeknown at every station of the army throughout the country that the Government will for theofuture, as inxtimes past, protect all its subjects in the undisturbed exercise of their religion. Earl GRAXVILLE.-I have always been the first to express my admiration of the strong feelings by which the noble earl is actuated, and of tho sinoerity with whioh he advocates anything which he conceives to be of advantage to. the Indian empire; but I do think that he has acted -on this occasion somewhat without comsideration, and that the remarks which he has just made must have a misichievous tendency in India. Certainly, they can have no good result, and I do think that there is considerable inconvenience in bringing questions beforo Parliament based mnerely upon telegraphic information. Thero is no doubt that this great application of science is attended with this inconvenience, that it is impossible to rely entirely upon the truth of any information which is forwarded merely by telgraph. No information as to the statement made by the noblo earl having reached the Government, except by telegraph, it would be unwise of me to say how far I believea treat ded of that statement to be exaggerated. What as, topished me was the attack made upon the Governor, -General by the noble earl iu the remarks which he made -remarks in which I entirely concur-as to the sacrific of the realy important interests of the country in what may be termed misguided attempts to proselytise the zatives. I believe-although himself a sincerdy religious man-there is no man more likely to act vdth judgment in every respect on these points than Lord Canning. (Eear, hear.) I do not speak so much from my knowledge of the noble lord as from the public and private letters which I have had the advantage of reading on these very points. I do not know whether he has subscribed to -any missionary society, or under what circumBtances such subscrption may have been made, bat I know tha ho has to deplore rumours which have been circalatel ,of tho most unfounded and ridiculous character, and which will gain some strength by the attack made upon him by a person of the eminence of the noble earL It was aaid that the Governor-General had left this country under -a pledge to Lord Palmerston that he would do his best to convert the whole of the native population of India. (A laugh.) I mentlon thds jut to show the charcter of the reports which were spread abroad on this point. As a per- n ftiend of Lord Canning I rejoice that, from what I hei, the -whole community of aoutta baa been struck wivth the firmness, judgment, and courage whioh hehp shown in dealing with the beginning of these mutinous pro ceedings. (Hear.) I may mention-for it shows what is my noble friend's opinion on these points-that the first time ho I exercized his veto on a Bill of tho Legislative Council was on account of a clause inserted in the Bill-it was in a Police Bill-which he conceived affected in some degree the religious feelings of the natives. I am glad that mnynoble friendhashad this opportunity of publicly testifying-his opinion of the importance of abstaining from all attempts to interfere wiGh the religion of the natives. I entirely concur in the eulogiuim which the noble earl has pronoanced on the speech of General Eearsay. That officer addressed the troops in their own language, I believe, in a most eloquent and forcible manner, and with adegree of feeling which seemsta ,have had a great effecb on them. I know that Lord Canning had a great admiration for that speech. He has called the attention of the Homo Government to it, andto the merits of General Heprsey; andthe charge of the noble lord, therefore, on this point falls to the ground. My answer to the question with which the noble lord conoluded is that tho Govern. ment think that Lord Canning has acted with admirable I judgment in abstaining from making an such noti6cation as that suggested by the nobleh earl. ;Such a notification. issued when the mutiny wasthreatened, would have appeared to be some sort of ackaowledgment that it was a change in the policy of the Government, whereas it ought to be as patent as possible that it is, and always has been, and thaerfore always will continue to be, the- policy of the Government to afford the greatest possible protection to the natives in the exercise of their religioua rights. Tho course taken by Lord Canning has been more judicious than that pointedcut by the noble earL The Government approve his not hang issued any such notification, and no instructionshave heen sent to sndia such as those suggested by the The Earl of MALMESBURY thought that, seeing the noble earl opposite had told thesthat the most unjustiiable rumours were in circulation respecting the feelings and opinions held by the Governor-General of India with regard to the religious condition of the natives of that coUntry, they were deeply indebted to his noble friend (Lord Ellenborough) for having afforded the Government an opportunity of contradicting such rumours. The noble earl opposite said we ought not to tske, for granted the truth of all the statements transmitted by the electric telegraph; bat the rumours respecting the Governor-General of Ind ia on this sabject did not rest on such despatches only ;-he had seen it stated in lettors from India that Lord Canning had subscribed to an association having for its object the conversion of the natives. Their lordships were perfectly aware how religious a man Lord Canning wvas, and they also knew that he was a man of calm judgment and great caution. (Hear, hear.) If, however, he had been led by his consieihtious and relous feelings to join any association of the kind described, ho must say he would have committed a grave error, considering the position in which he stood. The noble earl did not exaggerate the effects likely to have been produced in India had the Governor-General subscribed to such] associations; for those persons who were engaged in conscientiousXand estimable exertions to convert the inhabitants of India would scarcely be able to refrain rom giving themselves strength and power by quoting his name in their intercourse with the people. (Eear, hear.) Knowing, however, Lord Canning's caution andjudgment, he could not believe that he had been gailty of so imprudent an act as to mix himself up personay with these associations; and, as a friend of Lord Canning's, he could not regret that the noble earl opposite had had an opportunity of contradicting the rumours that were in circulation. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH wished to exlain that having seen a statement with respect to Lord Canning having subsoribed to these societies-a statement so astonishing that he could not believe it-he thought it right at once to mention the fact, because he felt deeply that it involved a question affecting materilly the security and stability of our Indian empire. (Hear, hear.) The Marquis of LANSDOWNE agreed with the noble earl that it was impossible to overrate the importance of this sulbject. It was of the utmost importanco that the conduct of Lord Canming in this matter should stand unimpeached. One in his high position should hold himself aloof from any such associations as those which had been referred to. Indif. ference in such matters in his public position was one of the first duties of his Government, nor should he in any degree or by any act of his give countenance to such reports as seemed most unaccountably and mysteriously to have prevailed in India. (Hear, hear.) He begged their lordships to suspend their judgments tiU they had specific information as to the associations and societies to whichLord Canning had subscribed. TPheywould not be prepared to say that he shoald subscribe to nothing in India, or that the Government should define at once to -what he should subseribe and to what he should nob. (Hear, hear.) But this he had to say, from not one only, but from repeated communications, both private and public, recently received from Lord Canning, that there was not a maln in England -not even the noble earl himself-who was more aware of the danger of couatenance being given to such movements than he was, From day to day he had a fuU sense of the danger before his eyes, and he showed the greatest anxiety that it should not be poesible for anyone to deduce from his conduct the inferencethat he would be guilty of such a charge as the noble earl had brought forward. Having the strongest public and private friendship for Loi d Canning, he was yet prepared to state that if byany error or mI stake of judgment-which he did not believe, andwhich he would not believe without proof-Lord Canning had so acted as to give countenance to such a belief as the noble earl inferred he would no longer deserve to be oontinued in his ofEice as Governor-General of India. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANVILLE said the noble earl (ELlenborough) had furnished him with the newspaper from which he had derived his information rthe noble earl held In his hAnd what we understood to be an Indian nezwpaper and he must say that it appeared to him nothing coulbe more vague than the statement there made. The sabscription might have been to some scientifio society, with a religious object in view, for anything that appeared to the contrary. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-What had fallen from the noble marquis was perfectly satisfactory. He had said that if it were the fact that the Governor-General had subscribed to any secieties having for their object the conversion of the natives he ought to be removed from the office he held, and thus all danger arising from the error would be completely removed. (ea, hear.) The Marquis of LANSDOWNE was understood to dissent. He had no doubt that Lord Canning would be able to justify any subscription that he might have entered into, and that no sabscription he had given would bear the construction which had been placed upon it. PRINCESS ROYALS ANNUITY. Earl GRANYILLE, in moving the second reading of this Bil, said,-On the assumption that your lordshiDs wlL agree with me in the principle that we ought to provide for the support of the institutions of this country, and, monarchy being one of the elements of our constitution, that we ought to deal in a spirit, not of wastefulness, but of just liberality to the Royal family (hear, hear)-that the Royal family should be maintained in honour and dignity, and that those ilustrious ladies belonging to it who go abroad should have a fair and liberal maintenance, it will not be necessary that I should trouble you with many observations. This might have offered a tempting opportunity to allude to certain qualities of Her Maiesty; but, though the feelings of affection and respect which we may entertain for the Sovereign may make us more anxious cordiaUy and unanimously to adopt a voto of this description, still I should be ashamed if I based it on any such affection and reepect. (Eear.) I only ask your lordships to take that course which I believe we are bound to do, not so much for the dignity of the Crown as from a regard to what is due to the feelings and natural pride of the country. (Hear.) The provision proposed in the present instanCe is reasonable, and, being reasonable, I am sure it wil be unanimously adopted by your lordships. (Hear, hear.) Looking to the precoedents in suoh cases, we find that for the rrincesses Royal, the daughters of George IL and George IIL, provision was made by a dowr of 80,0001., and an annuity of 5,0001. In this case tho dowry is lews by one-balt than that glven in former times, while the, annuity is largr, being 8,000&, instead of 5,0001. know there arersome who have thought that to pay down a large sum at once would have been a better arrangement, but I am not of that opinion. I think that when an ilustrious lady is married into a great kingdom and into a powerful House our object should be not so much to make provision for her children as to provide for that independence and that decent splendour which Iam sure every one of your lordships must think ought to attend the eldest daughter of the Sovereign (Rear. F orthese reasons, without dwelling upon the feelings o gratif6ction expressed by your lordships on a former evening at ani event which is likely to reward Hler Majesty for the excellent educationuhe,hIasbestowed upon the Prsinc Royal, and to render the Princess Royal as happy in her future lire as we all desire, I now ask your lorsh.ps to give a second reading to this BilL. (Hear. hear.) The arlof ALMSBUY sid,although, accrding to the old proverb, silence gave consent, 'Yet in the absence of his noble friend the Earl of Derby, he felt bound on the parzt of. noble lords on that side of the Haouse to express his satisfaction with the Bill Proposed and his admiration of the manner in which Her Majesty had exercised her rule in these reaims, and of the brrghht example which she had sot to all her subjects. (Hoar, hear.) With regard to the details of the Bil, as it hAd passed the Hfouse of Commons, it would be useless to discuss the queaftin whether any better planLconldhave been proposed. Forhi own part, he was inclined to believe it would have been better to have gve around sum at once, which would have placed the Priencess Royal int a more dignified oition than as an annuitant of this country. It would beidle, however, to discuss that question now, and he therefore had only to expres hi eonurrncewith the Bill 'which was before the The Bill was then read a secnd time. DIVORCE AND MATRIMON~IAL CAUSES BILL. The House then went into committee lpnti il which had been recommsitted.potiBl, Clauses I to 16 were agreed to. 'Upon clause 17 The LORD CHANCELLOR said, ~inee the pill had been printed he had received many com4 c~ic4n Vugsting that the provisions of this clausesih ewue ohs bands deserted by their wives.Te lupeowrta wvife who had heesa deserted by her hasn ihu esn able cause to apply to the Ccurtfor a ioeas,set tlwro, and he propossed now an amennb li h 12th line, which would give to husbands deeete:ythi wives the' samie right of application to the Cut Lord ST. LEONARD'S said thisz Bill sanctioned for the first time the principle that divoroee joWd be grun1ted upon be empowered to grant tI bitt not to pro- flounce a divoree. That was a much more reasonable proposition, and he should move as an amendment in line 15 that the clause be altered to enable the Court to grant alimony to a deserted wife, instead of the divorce a piensd t thore. Earl GREY rosa to order. The Lord Chancellor had proposad an amendment in line 12, and untW that was disposed of their lordships could not discuss an alteration in e 15. They ought toproceed according to the recognized rules and practice of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Lord ST. LEONARDS agreed with the noble earl, bu e maintained that the course he had pursued was calculated to save the time ot their lordships. The clause as it stood provided that desertion by her husband should give a wife a right to divorce amessd et thero. The Lord Chancellor now proposed to extend the clause so as to meet the case of a -wife deserting her husband. Noit, his argament was that neither hasband nor wife should have a right to divorce for desertion; and if his amendment to that effect were adopted by their lordships there would be no necessity for discussing the alteration proposed by the Lord Chancellor in line 12 Earl STANHOPE thought that much of the irregularity which arose in committee proceeded from the unsatisfactory mode in which the amendments wereo pinted. They appeared, not according to the order in which they ought to be taken up, but according to the names of the persons proposing them. Earl GRANVILTE was of opinion that some latitude should be allowed to their lordships in the discussion of amendments applying to the samo clause. At the same tinie he thought the Honse would gain much if it gaverather more authority to the person in the chair. (Hear, hear.) He could not make a proposal of that kind when the Lord Chanicellor was presiding, becaue the noble and learned lord 'was a nominee of the Government; but he was at liberty to say that if the chairman of committees, an officer selected by their lordships themselves, were invested with a kdnd of mild despotism great advantage would result in the transaction of publio business. (Hear, bear.) The Marquis of CLANRICARDE desired to know what was the question before the House. (A laugh.) Lord REDESDALE replied, that the question was tho amendment proposed by the Lord Chancellor in line 12. In no circumstances would he have put any other question than that; but it was always open to any noble lord to suggest that, for the sake of convenience, two amendments beaing upon the same subject should be discussed together. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of EETZWILTZAM wished to make an ob,servation on a word in the second line of the clause. (A laugh.) He thought that " separation" should be substtuted for "1 divorce" with reference) to the prcweding here contemplated as the result of desertion. The LORD CHANCELLOR remarked that the clause, as it now stood, provided that any wife deserted by her husband for two years should have a right to divorce a msnsd et thoro. Since the Bill was printed he had received a number of letters from husbands stating that a corresponding benefit ought to be given to them. He saw no reason why that request should not be complied with, and thereforo he proposed to introduce words in line 12 giving a husband the same remedy if deserted by his wife as the clausenow gave to a wife if deeerted byher husband. lIat session great discussion took place as to whether in the case of unjustifiable, desertion there ought not to be divorco a vincdo msrimonii, as was the law in Scotland. The committee decided in the negative, but their lordships thought that some relief ought to be given, and it was at his own suggeston that, instead of being entitled to divorce a mesna et thoro for desertion, a wife was to be simply enabled to pietition the eourt, and obtain an order for alimony. Since that time he had changed his mind upon the point, and his objection to alimony was that the husband might come back sand deprive his wsife of the relief granted by the Court. Lord CAMPBELL did not object to the husband having the same l ht a3 the wife to obtain from a competent court on reasonalbe evidence a sepation, equivalent to what was known to the law as a divorce d m7nd et thoro, which was not, in fact, a divorce, because the parties might come together again and live happily the rest of their days. (A laugh.) It was proposed by some that there shouldbe no community of property whatever between husband and wife, and he was surprised that the proposal should have received the sanction of his noble and illastrious friend (Lord Broughamil1instrious for his promotion of law reform and his defence of the female sex. (Laughter) With married persons there should be oommunity of property as 'well as of persons; but whern a new icu was acquired by divorce a mna a thorso fhe commuity of property ought to cease. The wife's property would then be protecten, and they would bear no more of the cruel mnstances of husbanda returningo and swveeping away everything belonging to their deserted w ives. The amendment was agreed to. Earl FITZWILLIM said, a woman who was separated occupied a different position from a woman who was divorced.. The general public did not understand the legal ditinction between a divorce a v,inculo and divorce a meoda et thoro. He would, therefore, move to substtute the word separation" for divorce a me,ss et thor. Lord CAMPBELL suggested that, to make it more intel. lgible, itshould be separation from bed andboard. The L,ORD-CEIANCELOR wvould not pledge himself to the precise words, but thongkt they should insert the words "judicial separation, which shall have all the effect of" before " divorce 4 mn et there." Earl GREY approved the amendment, because it would maske the Bill eadily understood. Lord ST. LEONARD'S thought every one understood what was meant by divorce a inenad et Uhoro. It wa divorce so far as it compelled each party to submit to separtion. Earl FITZWILLIAM was understood to adopt the suggestion of the)Lord Chancellor as to the form of the amendment. After a short conversation, in which Lords Wnst"syDALB, CAMPBnU, and Dxmrn took part, the amendment, propoing to substitute the words " judicial separation" for " divorce a mensed a tlwro," was put and agreed to without a divison. The Duke of ARGYLL hoped it was understood that a corresponding substitution of terms would be made in the rest of the Bill wherever it was necessary. The CHAIRMAN said, that would be understood as a matter of course. On the question that the clause, aS amended, stand part of the Bill, Lord ST. LEONARD'S said, he thought the substitation of "judicial separation" for " divorce 2a mend thoroe" was a very unwise one, altering as it did, and without, as it seemed to him, due consideration, a well-understood phrase 'which had beea known to the law from the earliest times. (Hear, hear.) Their lordahips could not define what "judicial separation" was. Besides, he might remind them that an alteration of terms cid not change the substance of the thing meant, and it was therefore desirablo to adhere to tho old phraseology. The noble earl (Earl Fitzwilliam) seemed to speak of "judicial separation" as if it were something distinct from divorce a. mesad et thoro, but it .as, in point of fact, the same thing. He (Lord St. Leonard's) believed tho intention of the committee upstairs, on whose report the Bill was founded, was to ahere as nearly aspossible to the established law, buat to give a new tribunal, and readier means of access to that tribunal, to all classes of the population. The Committee divided, when there were- Non-contents 7 67 Majonty. 8 9 The clause was then agreed to. On clause 18, The LORD CHANCELLOR statedl, in reply to a question from the Earl of Donoughlmore, that he did not propose to make any alteration in the existing law relating to alimnony. The clause was agreed to, as were also clauses 19, 20, and 21. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, he now rose to propose a clause with reference to a question which occasioned considerable discusion when this Bill was last before their lordships-namely, as to the punishment of persons who 'were guilty of adultery. It was originally proposed by thts Bil that an action of crim. con. should not be brought until after a divorce had been obtained. That proposition was very fully discused, but it was not satisfactory to theirlordshipi and it was rejected. The noble and learned lord opposite (Lord St. Leonard's) proposed that adultery should be constituted a msidemeanour, and he (the Lord Chancellor) had considered with great attention the propriety of carring that suggestion into effeot. He had, however, arrived at the concluson that it was not desirable to make adultery a mis. demeanour, for on manv accounts it would be extremely diicult, if act impracticable, to carry out such An enactment. It would, for instnce, be necessry to make exceptions where the adulterer was not aware that the woman was mried, for in many cases traps migt be laid, and a man might be guilty of adultery without beingaware that he had committed any crime known to the law. A very eay mode of extorting money would thus be afforded, and he thought the evil likely to result from such a changl of the law woula counterobanco its advantages. The two1objects w'hich they should endeavour to accompHsh were, first, to render the commission of adultery less frequent; and, secondly, to take care that, when procee(iings were adopted for obtaining a divorced 2dncuio enatrimonii, there should be a bond lFde resisting party, and that no colluaion should take place. He now proposed a clause with the view of carrying out those objects. What he suggested was that any person seeking to obtain a divorce a vincuio mct-imonii should not be at liberty, as he now was, to proceed against the wife alone, unless the court should declare that there were spacial reasons for sanctioning such a course, and also a fortiori that he should not be enabled to proceed against the adulterer alone in the absence of the Wife, so as to fix adultery on her in her absence, bur that in every case when the husband- sought a divorce, & Vi2icuo matri. mioni, on the ground of adultery, he should present a petition to the court praying that both perties should be made respondents or. defendants in the case. Both the parties, the alleged adulterer znd the wife, would thus be before the court, and the ac'ion would be nOuDfde re6isted. As to the punishment, he should propose that the Court should have power to impose a fine upon the pamour, and thatfine, with the view ofindiating Shat itvsnotintanded to be merely a nominal one, be 3hould propose to limit to an amount not exoeeding 10,0001. he telieved that the amount of the fine and tho ,iubliity of the proceedings would be effectual securities against colruAon. Lord BROUGHAM entirelv spproved the snsljtuta for the action of crim.n, con. peoposed by his nto sln =ci learned friend. It was admaittetl on ai hands that that action must be abolished. That -- the opin!>n of suchI eminent men as Larxd Eldon, 1Tr ! th-e nvi:, Mr. pitt, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Ersldre; atc fi, r :iiy difficnuty 'was to yroside a sabstitnt;..

Tbey had produced upon hIs mind the most absolute convictioa that the thng was utterly and entirely impossible. Yet this action was tried behind the back of the lady, and. but for the exertions of his noble and learned friend, then not her counsel, but that of the defendant, her character might have been ruined for life, she being all the time as guiltle-s as any other human being. (' Rear, hear," from Lord Campbell.) He preferred the infliction of a fino to making adultery a misdemeanour on account of the danger of conspiracy which beset the latter course, and against which ho was afraid that no sufficient security could be provided. Earl GREY thought that the clause as amended was a great improvement on the original clause. He should be glad to see imprisonment enacted as a punishment as well as a fine, andn if no other noble lord undertook the task he should; later on in the discussion, propose a clapse to that effect. It was with great reluctance that he consented to legalie the tivorce a vincsot1. The present measure ought, howecver, to be looked on ag an experiment only, and if there rrere any signs of relaxed morality under the new system we ought at once to return to what had hitherto been the theory, not the practice, of the EnglEsh lawv. I Lord CAMI'BELL cordially approved the clause as amended, but suggested that there should be no limit to the fine, but that It should be left to the Court to apportion it according to the circumstances of the case and the means of the offender. * The Bishop of OXFORD concurred In the necessity of gdding the punishment of imprisonment to that of fine, cause itsavoured more of disgrace than a mere money payment woul and it ought to be the policy of the Legis- iature to do all in its powrer to brandthis offence vwth infmnsy. He should. later on move a clause to make it lawful for the Court to impose imprisonlment as well as a fixe, aud also to give power to apply any part or the whole of the fine to paling the coat of the proceedings. Clauses 22 to 25 were agreed to. The LORD CHANOELLOR proposed a clause after clause 25, providing for the imposition of a fine on adulterous parties. TheBishop of OXFORD proposed as an amendment, that the adulterous paies should be liable to "fine and imprisonment, or fine or imprisonment," and that it should be lawful to apply the fine to pay the whole or a portion of the costs of the proceedings. The LORD CHANCELLOR thought it would be better tolimit the puniahment to fine, as this was the first time that such a principle had been introduced into the law. Lord DUNGANNON supported the amendment, as a fine only would be of very lite effect in the case of wealthy persons. Lerd CAMPBELL thought it would be botter to keep by the fine alone. In some cases a husband might feel reluctance and even horror at taking a course which might send his wife, even though guilty, to-prison. The Duke of NORFOLK observed that in some cases a heavy fine would fall as a punishiaent upon the children. The Bishop of OXFORD reminded their lordships that imprisonment was not rendered imperative by his amend. ment. It might be infficted in extreme cases, but these would be very rare. The LORD CHANCELLOR could imagine nothing more revolting to tho mind of a man whose wife had been unfaithful to him than the reflection that he could not obtain a divorce without subjecting her to imprisonment. Lord BROUGHIA.I objected to the amendment, which gave a court power to iuflict a heavy punishment of imprisonment without the intervention of a jury. No doubt the tole action of a court was sometimes useful, as in cases of insolvency or boakruptpy, but it was not the same in Tespect fccriminal proceedings. The Bishop of OXFORD observed that, by a new clause which would be proposed, there would be a trial before a Earl GREY said, as they were about for the first time to make divorce a part of the law of the land it was necessary to guard that change by every possible precaution. A pecu- iay fine might be suffident in some eases, but there were others in which it would be totally inadequate. Therewere pecial cases in w hich justice could only be done by punish. ng the guilty parties by imprisonment. In cases where a ,designing woman had entrapped a man into adultery with the desire of being detected, a fine would be of little use. SueJx cases might be rare, but that they did sometimes occur wfas ai matter of history. The committee then divided, when there appeared For the amendment ... ... ... 43 Against it.... . 33 . Maority. ... ... ... -10 The amendment was consequently carried, and the clause as thus amended was agreed to. Clauses up to 44 were agreed to. Upon clause 45, the clause in which, on the motion of the Archbishop of Canterbury, words were inserted prohibiting persons divorced after being proved guilty of adultery from marrying again, | The IORD CHANCELLOR proposed anamendment, the affect of which, he said, would be to restore the clause to the conldition in which it originally stood, and to allow guilty parties to marry again. Without entering into the Scriptural argument, he put it to his right rev. friends, could there be anything more sandalous thanran Act of Par. liament which should compel a woman to remain single, or, what was very probable, should force her into prostitution? (Hear, hear.) Under any circumstancoes such a thing ought to be avoidV; but let their lordships observe what an in jUStiee they weore perpetratiing when they left the adulterer ree to marry, while placing ai Prohibition upon the woman divorced in consequeneo of his lieontiousness. HIe thought, for his own part, that there ought to be no restriction;* that n divorcodwsfe oughtt1o be at liberty toinarry the adulterer br any one else, for he believed there wa,s ai lare class of persons upon whom the apprehension of beig yoked for life wit their paramours would have a stronger restraining influence than either fine or imprisonment. (Hear, hiear.) L.ord BROlUGAM expressed his eordial approval of the amendment. The Archbishop of CANTERBURY, who was very imperfectly heard, was understood to say that both upon cptural grounds andfor reasons of publie moralitq he did uot think that guilty persons ought to be permitted to Inarry again. He would therefore oppose the amendment. The Duake of AEGYLL stated that several noble earls had voted for the introduction of the words proposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury upon the suppositon that they amounted merely to a prohibition of marriage between parapours, He could not believe that a msjrity of their lord. ships would wish to condemn a person guilty of adultery to perpetualcelibacy or, probably, to a life of immorality. It vwas not improbable that some so-calea amendments had been proposed with a view to the rejection of the Bill else. ,where. (Hear, hear.) I The Earl of DERBY said the amendment of the Arch'bishop of Canterbury, which it was now proposed to expunge, did not oondemn the guilty party to perpetual celibacy. Itprovidedthat the husband or wife guilty of adultery Bhoed not marry while the husband or wife who had obtained a divorce continued to live. If that provision were removed they would have the anomaly of a person divorced a vincudo being in a better position than a person divorced a menss et aoro because the latter could not but the former could, marry in the lifetime of the person from 'whom they were divorced. Earl GREY explained.that on the former eveninghe voted for the amendment of the Archbishop of Canterbury, because he did not wish to see divorce a vancudo given without rome safeguard ; but he thought it il fulfilled that purpoe, and, as they had now made adultery liable to pmabment, not only by fine but by imprisonment, he should vote witL the Lord Chancellor to have it struck out. The Bishop of OXFORD said the object should be to surround the innocent with the greatest number of guards, rather than to leave the guilty exposed to the possible inconvenience of marrying their paramours. That was most eminently the character of the proposition of the Archbishop of Canterbu. Al experience showed that the purity of civhicd society dependcd more upon the absolute chastity of the woman rather than the principle of the man. The temptation to sin assailed the mab and the woman on two opposite sides of their character. In the man the great temptation was the gratification of ;ppetite, but it was not so in the woman. The late Mr. Coleridge in one of his admirable essays on the relation between the two sexes, expressed the idea so forcibly that he would guotethe words,-"The desire of the manisfor thewom an; te desre of the woman is for the desire of theoman." That was to say, that the woman was led astray, not by the direct temptation of sensual appetite, but by the proffer of affection-by the promise that what in early life she trusted to be to her husband, but had failed inbeingnamely, the object of attachment and affection-she would be to t)he tempter. Those married wromen rwho had fallen from the direct temptation of aprpetit were very ore exceptions, and in 99 cases out of 100 they fell, because their marriage had been unhappy initsonsequences, Tosay, thereforet that the woman should not marry for the atural lifetime of the husband she disonoured was to take away from tho tempter a provailing bait and to give an additional safeguard to her remaining innocoent. Let their lordships remember what the proviso was that was embodied in the clause at the instance of the most rev. prelate (the Archbishop of Canterbury). It was not in any Eense put in as a penalty upon either parthy tat they should be prolibited from marrying longer than they would have been prohibited from marrying another if they had no, sinned, The innocent Party was allowed under the clause to mzary again, and was it an extreme punishment to say to the gnultypersonthat he or she should notmarry againduring the lifetime of the party from whom he or she was divorced I It seemed to him monstrous to represent that as an oatrageous violtion of libery. After a few words from Lords DE Ros and Dui.- GANNlON~, The Committee divided on the question that "the words proposed to be left out stand part of the clause," when the numbers were- Content ... ... ... ... ... 24 Not content ... ... ... ... ... 46 Majority in favour of the Lord Chancemor's motion ..- ... ... ... -22 The result of this division was to expunge from the Bill the proviso caried on a former occasion, on the motion of the Archbishop of Canterbury, prohibiting thS husband. or wife convictedof adultery from contracting another marriage during the life of tha wAfe or husband from wFhom they had been divored Lord WENSLEYDALE then moved to add a p2oviS that either party should not marry the person with -hom the adultery was proved to have been committed, and the Courtin its decree for a divorce was to name that person. The Marquis of LANSDOWNE could. not assent to the amendment, which he thought would not tend practicelly to promote the interests of religion and morality. He believed that In esses of this description women were generally led inboerror by pasion, and those who hd lived long in the world were awre of the feeling with which women who had so erred nreregarded by their own eex. Even if women i wllohadthus fllen remarried, they were stin * aoftion of great degrdation, and it was difficvlte estimate tbepunith. ment they suffered. The object of legislation should be to p,ovide for tho reformation of offenders after they had suffered punishment for their critmes, but he believed the effect of this amendment, by depriving a woman of the opportunity of marrying her partner in sin, would be to degrade her utterly, and to drive her to a course of prostitution. When they dealt with a burglar or or a per. jurer they always supposed that he might by repentance bo qualified to resume, in some measure, that positionia society which he had occupied before he became a criminal; and were they inthe case of a woman sloneto refusetheoppor. tunity of reformation, although experienco had shown that women who had violated the marriage vow had subsequently become faithful wives and good mothers, and had showa tbemselves deserving of that limited respect which could be gained by persons under such circumstances? He agreed .with a great legal auth'etity who had said that cases of this description ought to be dealt with accotdingto the particular' circumstances of each case, and he considered that the dis., cietion ought to be left to the court. This amendment however, if it should be adopted, would deprive the court of any discretionaiy power. The Bishop of OXFORD, in supporting the anendmenlt, observed that it was unneoewary to repeat the arguments he had urged on a former occasion, but he might remind their lordships that they were not legislating simply for one class, but for all classes of the community, and that they ought to consider the effect which might be produced by their le. lation upon what were caled the lowerg orders of society. It Was said that they thould, not iMpose too stringent restrictions in the first instance, becauseif itwere found necese. sar the law might subsequently be rendered mnore serere - hut all experience showved ehat it wras much easier to rea a lar than to increase its stringency. Lord CAUPBEL L should support the amenament of his noble wad learned friend. Their lordships then divided, and the numbers were,- For tbe amendment... ... ... .. 28 Against ... 37 3ajority . .. -9 The amendment was therefore los.

The hon. member, in explantion of the question, said that the Act itnowstood dnotsetforth out of what fund the fees which it authorized to be given to those constables were to be paid. Sir G.

TRAFFIC THROUGH PARK-LAM~. Mr. BAILIEE asked the EInt Comumisioner otf Works whether, in pursaAnoe of. the reeonmnxndation of the Me8tro. politan Improvement &ommitee of 1855, he ha beer, able to deovise any plan for relieving the great increas of traffic which now paased through Park.lane, and whichbadbecome so dangerus to the public, Also, whether thete woula be any objection .to open to 'the pnbliO the rodd through the' Park from Stanhope-street-gato to Hydo Park-corngr Sir B. HALL said that the oommittee of 1855 hiad roti' mended that one of the first operimings-hich sbogd bomAor for facilitating the trafflo of the metropolis should be a.roid from PiccadUlly through Hamilton-placeandon to Stankop. . street-gate. In cousequenoc of that recomajendaciin he, it, the course of last year, had proposed to take some step withb tho view of carrying it into effeo; he had, howvevr, . beenatoacemet byan objection tohis scheine upon the parb of eight or nine personx residing in Haznilton.place To. test the validity of tha;objection he had the cme lId before the law officers of the Crown;, and they had given it as theiF .opinion that it was valid. He had, therefore, been umnabe 'to-take any farther steps to carry obt the recommendati6nofr ithecomnittee. InTeplytothesecond qusestioo,he mnight tat0 that, in his opinion, there was serious objection to throwing open to the publietheroadfrom Stnhope-street-geto Hyda. Park-corner. If it were open for trafflc by day it shouldba open also bynight, and-the result would be that the whole, of the park would be open by night-a state of thing which he felt assured no hon. member would rish to ha-e brought about. Ho should add that it was quit obvious that great inconvenience arose from the narrow state of Park-lane, but under the Act of 1855 powrer was ve6ted in ertin yes. tries to purchase land in that quarter with the view of widening the thoroughfare, and ii that were done lie shouli not hesitate to say that a great improvement would be l tected. AUD1TORSHIP OF THE POOR-LAW BOARD. Mr. CRSAUFURD asked the President of the Poor-law Board whether the hon. member for Bo9*n still oontinued to hold the offlce of auditor under the board. Mr. BOUYERIE. said, the bon, member for Boson Ws one of the auditors of the loor-law union accounts. He had been elected last year, under the operation of an Aat of the reign of Her present Majesty, by the chairman and vcechairman of the Poor-law distict -In which he acted as auditor. He was only one of 49 other Poor-law officers who discharged duties of asimilag chracter, and whose appointments under the immnedite control of the Poor-law Board, because they were elected in the manner which had just been stated. The hon. member for Boston, however, was paid out of money taken by vote in that House on account of the Poor-law Board, and was iable by statte to disissaIY thatbor in the eac of his being incompetent to the discharge of 1U dutlis. The fact of his having been elected to represent Boson did not,he{Mr.Bonverme) believed, reder him incapable of occupying his present position. He consequen'dy retaineil. theofficeof auditor; and, so far s his experec of *the Poor-law Board went, he bad every raon to thin bnm a most useful officer. CONSOIIDATION OF THE STATUTRES [r. POWEL wished to ask what progress had been made by the commisioners appointed for consoldating the Statute Iaw in the prepartion of mesures for that pur.- pose, and whether it was intended to introduoe duringthe preset ession a Bill for the oonsoidation of any portion of the statutes; and,if such was theintention of the Govern. ment, what portion of the states would be deelt wit?

ITHE FATAL lSOHANCE AT BELLEISLM Mr. DILLWYN roe to ask the First Iord of the Tres, ntry whether Her Majs Government had reciTed any information respecting the eircnatances attending the death of James William seaman on board the John and Edward-schooner, of Aberystwith, who was idlled in the lihrbourof BeUeisle on the 24th day of May last by a shot fired from the French war chooner Maratch? He believed that the John and Edward put into the harbour of Blleisle through srews of weather, being unprepaed&with the requi. site ignals The Maratch fired two blank shots, and while. the crew were getting up the ensign a third shot wm fired at the cew, wrhich killed one of the men.

The state- the h cs ade onveys to the House pretty nearly the. co,oursof, the transaction. The John and Edward enteredt qse roads of BeUeisle without having any colour flying. I think the ommander wa wrong, for of couse no ship ought to enter the harbour of a foreign country without oolours to distinguish her nationality. Stil, the conduct of the officer in oommand for the moment of the Fxech eswcl of war was quite unjustifab, because, although his ving ordered two blank musketfshots to be fired ouald ndt complained of, yet he was not justified in the precipitaion wth which he ordered a shotted musket to be discharged in tho direction of the vesseL .His a egation in that the man was ordered to fire highand thatthe bal glsnced, brt unfortunately, the shot took effect It is but tustice to-the French Government to say that no oporft ity s given to Her Majest' Government to mae any remonstranoeto the French Government, bcuse Count 3Falewsld of his own accord volunteered to Her Maje sty Ambasador at Paris a communication of the most satisfactory and handsome kind. (Hear, hear.) He expressed Oe deep regret of the French Government at what had taken place, stating tbat orders had been iven to dismiss fom the French servioe the offioer who had given orders t> fire the fatal musket shot (hear, hear); and adding that the French Government were about to institute inquiries to 4scertain ia what way and to what degree they might mitigate the affliction of the family of the unfortnate man.

The motion was agteed to. GRAND JUP.IES (METROPOLIS). Er F. THESIGE. n ising for leave to bring ine a BE to dispense with the attendance of grnd juries at the, Central Criiail Court, aa, said, that in proposing an measure of this nd he was prepared to expect that those. who had notthad their attention called to the subject night ecgard with some apprehension an interference with a venerable institution, wrhiuhi'aey were accustomaed to regar& as essential to thefair adeilnistrationof crimimlnsjutcsc,and. one of the most important s feguards of the liberty of des subject. lno doubten i n the it ofprwsystemof grandjuries ttained those objects, but by zecentchanges in the cdminal 1aw, and wa imaproved system of preliiniar invesigtonB of charges in themetropolitnus police courts, its sefulnema had been considerably diminished, and the necesty of continuing the system Inthe metropolis bemooe extreme questionable. The qu estion was by no means newr, for the subject of grand juries had attraced public attention formiany years. A grcat deal of evidence wa taken before the commission appointed to inquire into the stte of the, Icrimnanl law, and afterwads the quAestion of grnd jude. was again investigated by a committee of that llouse. Observations had since fallen from judges on the bench, complasints had been made by advocates, which bad beenw echoed through the press, and wear after yeAr the grn^Di juries of the Centrjal Criminal Uoutt a-nd the Middlesex. 3esons had been inb the habit of presenting themnselvres, not only as of no utility, huAt as being an absolute impediment tc the administration of justice. Norhadlegisltaveattempte been anting althoug they w^ere uianuoocefui, In 1849 the late Sir J. Jernis brought in a Bill to facilitate the sadministration of justice in the metropolitsn districts, hich contsaied provisions rendering unnceary the summoning of and juries. T:hat ,Bill was referred to. a select committee, who exmined, among oth-ers ae, elerk of the Central Criminal Court, the Common Serjeant; of that day, 31r. HumphreYs, a solicitor practising in the Central C riminal Court, who had written an excellentb pam plet on grand juries; an aldermanofthe cityofLondon, the chairman of the Newington Sessions, anda merchant o the city of London who bad been foreman of grandjuries for a great number of years. These witnesses expressed aD unanimous opinion that it was deirble grnii inties should not be asembled within the metro. politan districts, and this opinion was supported by reasons which seomed to him to be nanswerable. Notbing, however, was done on this subject. Bat in the year 1852 the then Recorder of London, whose unfortunate. ilneus was deeply to be deplored, and whose high charater and sound judgment it was to be hoped would yetIheseful to his country (hear, hear), addressed the grand jury, after onsLiderable experience of the working of hs sysem, in' the followingterms:- " Tho great mas of the ces wre, as usual, o4he ordi, nary description, and many of their predecssorstn that box had expressed an opion that it was unUnceSry that the? should bo called together for the purpose of considerin ta cases.

("Hea, hear,' and a laugh.) They then went on to say " While we admit that the adoption of some of our suggetilons is likely to be productive of a certain amount of benefit, wve arm yet unanimously of opinion that the whole plan of the hospital is radically faulty, and we are persaded that the contemplated scheme of artificial ventation as explained to us by Captain T&n wMl in allpro4biaity aggravate the very evils which it is intended to remedy. We were informed that the plan of the building had received the approval of several ofthe medical officers connected with other of the metropolitan hospitals, but we have reason to believe thhb there may be rome misconeeption on the minds of the committee at the War-office as to the extent to which this is the case. In this atatemeut werefer espeoiall ytothe size of the wards, to the constuction of the corriidor, and to the proposed, but highly objectionable method of artificial ventilation,-which we may be allowed to mention are the three most important points connected with the sanitary economy of the hospitaL We think it a matter of regret that the meOical gentlemen whose opunons were desired had not the opportunity afforded to them of meeting to. getber and investigating the plans as well as the proposed I alterations, as such a course would have insured a more satisfactory result than is likelv to be arrived at by merely askrng the opinions of individuals who had had no previous interommunication, upon isolated points unconnecied with the general arrangements of the building. In concluEon we have only to express our earnest hope that your lordship will not sanction the present plan, which may, and in our opinion wvill simply ceuvert a large and costly building into a hotleacf erydpelas and hospital angrene. It was mentioned to us that this would trobably form only the commencement of extensive military uildings in the neighbonrhood of Netley, and if this be the caso your lordship. may consider.whether it would not be a more prudent, as well as eventuAlly a more economical course, to abandon the intention of oompleting the present buildings as a hospital, for which they are so ill adapted, and to convert them into barracks, or other military structares requiring less peculiar sanitary arrangements." That was the btatement of men whose character and emi. nence no one could question. He hoped it was not too late to crry into effect the suggestions which they. had made from practical experience in their own hospital. When the return was laid upon the table they would be able to see what professional geutlemen-engineers or medical menhad boldly taken upon themselves the responsibilty of a hospital open to such eriticim. (Hear.) They were supposed nowr to re founding a model hospital for the troops. He sud nothing of the difficulties of The foundation. He said nothing of the increased expense which the muddy nature of the soil had requirea or that foundation. He said nothing about the site and the muddy banks left bare at low tide. He would not enter into those questions nor give much weight to the alarm about ague, which was stated to be one reason against the situation of the building He rested his objection& upon this-that alter the buiing as they might they could never make it such a hoapital as ought to be constructed with their pre. sent knowledge of sanitary arrangements, and witb the exuerience which had been so dearly bought (Hear.) rhey had voted the money, and the building was now in progress. He commended it specally to the care of the Government. He did not wish themto take the statement of the Middlesex Hospital gentlemen as not open to contradiction. Let them examine men who had characters to lose, who had reputations to sustain, whose names would carry weight through the country, and If It were possible, even now, let them desist from spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in order to erect a building whichin site perhaps, but certainly in construction, far from beingacredit, would bea disgre, and, far fromsavig the lives and restoring the health of our soldiers, would, as m the opinion auoted, be " a hotbed of erysipelas and hospital sP^agrene. (Cheers.) He thanked the hon. baronet orbringing forward the subect. He waa glad the Government had madenp their minds to grant theroturn, and he hoped that return would speedily be laid upcon the table of the House. (Hear, hear.) No other member presenting himself the SPrAxx was %bout to put the question when Mr. S. HERBERT rose and said,-I was rather In hopes bhat the Government would have made some explanation in naswerto the statement of the hon. gentleman who has just Fat down. I confess that I am not one of those who think that anything extraordinary has happened when an estimate nade by the Government turna out to be insufficient For the ultimate completion of the works (a laugh), because I have observed that in commercial under. akdngs and in private undertaldngs invariably the ame thing happens I do notfind that railroada have been ,ompleted for the original estimate. I do not find hat a Cryal Palace has been erected for the sum orlginally ontemplated. (Hear, hear.) When works upon a great wale are in question, I think the Government must have ,hat allowance which Is made to all other men, to all com?anies aud associations, and that the difference of cost oon. equent upon the fallibiity of engineers and merchants nust be paid by those who engage in the undertaking. Hear, hear.) I make no charge upon that ground, because [ expect such a result when dealing with large surms. But bere is a ceas of really very geat importance. Our hospitals tor the army are no doubt inferior, not only to our oivil, but to our naval hospitals. The most cursory comparison.will convince any one of that fact We wirsh to remedy the evil by constructing a hospital worthy of the Dountryand of the purpose to which it is devoted. Ag far Rs we can see at present, if not failure, great doubt of success is thrown upon those charged with this construction. rhe hon. baronet, the Under-Secretary for the War Department, says he can show by the papers that the site was Eiot adopted or the construction determined upon without great deliberation. That is quite possible, but great deliberation is very often followed by failure. In one sex we know it is equivalent to being lost. (A laugh.) In par. ficular instances deliberation does not inspire confidence. rhe gentlemen of the Middlesex Hospital made representalions with regard to the constraction of this building, and Lt was fortunate they did so. The Govemnment, when they saw the objections, inquired into the plans. The army hospitals at Chathamn and Portsmouth are upon one construction, whioh has been condemned. Unfortunately in She plan fist adopted at Netley that identical construction was adopted. ( ear, hear.) The fault of the constrachon In the hospitals at Chatham and Portsmouth is ;hat they have a long corridor, from which open a series of narrow wards having only light by windows atthe extreme esds. What is now the best received plan for the construction of a hospital is,-detaehed buildings, with windows Dpoeningon either side,o asoto obtain athorough draughtfrom sLde to side instead of lengthways. If the windows are Lengthways the opening then creates a draught, like the wind paLsing through a tuannel, and causes so much inconvenience, that they must be closed and the ventilation stopped. It is only fair to say that the wards in this hospital are not of great length. Not only is it necesaTy that the wards of a hospital should have plenty of air, but plenty of lght and sun. A building with a large corridor in front may be made very architectural, the back yening upon offices, which are not very presentable. But if you make the corridor in front you must Ft the lights at t&6-bick. In this instance a handsome rontage s put facing the river, and the windows for the passage of air into the wards are in the contrary direcbion. But the result is that the windows look upon the north-east, which is a bad aspect, instead of upon the south "at, which is a good aspect. Subseguently to the remonAtrance a very great improvement has been made. The mrridor is to be oonstructed on a series of arches, which wiU be glazed in winter and open in summer So far as the defect of construcan be remediec it has been remedied. But I believe ifyou built separate buildings there would be much less ohance of infection, and that the draught and light from tho twro sides would render tho place more bealthy. (Hear.) As regards the site, there is a great difference of opinion I always understood that Southampton later was not what is called an unwholesome, but a relxing climate. If this hospital is meant forthereception only of Individuals coming from tropical climates, I do aotthinkthat a disadvantage. But I am informed that loutbampton water lies upon a bed of peat, with a coat. Ing of mud, not ss deep but that the salt water percolates through and there hubbles up 6ulphuretted hydrogen gas. Iaughter.) It is not a very pleasan' prospect for the windows of a hospital. At the same time, I believe, that the hospital has been sufficiently removed back, or the esplanade thrown so far into the -water that any noxious ?ffeet from any gas of the kind will be prevented. But diere is a radical error in the selection of the site. You ire going to build a hospital of 1,000 beds. Your object will be twofold. First, it will be made a model for army ospitas; secondly, it is to become a medical school for coung practitioners of the army. If it be an invalid hospital you will receive into it all men sent bome pensioned sand discharged from foreign countries. But it is not in counexion with any existing garrison. If man falls sick at Portsmouth you caunot compel that man to be shaken for 40 miles over a railroad, bec use yoa have built a large hospital, aud wanxt to fil the beds. And there will be this disadvantage, that those who are to re ceive iastruction in this hospital will be confined to the study of chronic cases,-of men who have come iU from abroad, and not of men taken ill on the spot. I believe the faults of the hospital have been remedied to a great degree; but upon the question as to whether tho hopital is in a position which will make it the most available for the use of the army IconfessaI am lVund to saythe choico of a dite has been most unfortunate. (Hear, hear.) Lord PALMERSTON.-No doubt, this is a question of considerable importanes, because when a large sum o0 money bas been laid out in the construction of an hospital it is dedrable that the building, both in regard to site and construction, shall be calculated to cure and not to prolong cr create disease. With regrd to the difference between the original estimate and the subsequent one my bon. friend (Sir J.Ramsden) gave whrat I thought a proper and satisSactory explanation. He sat%ed that when the estimate was first presented it had not been found possible to frame an estimate according to a given plan, but that the estimate was framed from what was assumed from former experience to be the cost of an hospital of a given size and on the old plan by practical men. A rough plan was afterwards made, and an estimate framed for a larger sum than Was criginaUy put upon the votes with regard to the building in question. With reference to the site I certainly never heard that that side of Southampton Water was called unhealthy. We all know t4hat the l?orest, which is on the oppositO side, being on very low ground and wet, has been considered to a eertain degree unhealtly; but the spot on which this hospital is to be erected rests upon gravel, and is elevated and ojpen to currents of air, and there has been no reason to suppose that it would be unhealthy, or not adapted to the purpose for which it i8 inteuded. With regard to the conatructioc; there is considerable enoe sof opinion as to the proper mode of constructing bUilding designed for a hopitl iy right hon. friend (Mr. Sidney Herbert) states thaS he most approved plan is one in which there is acorridor, with blocks of building attached sepated from each other by spaces, and strtehing away at right sngles. There are certainly advantge in that arranemont. beause it enables you to Set a draught by side windows through each ward But those blocks, aepa. rated from each other by spaces, look into narrow and confined courts, beeause the very blocks make oourts of themselves, and so preveut a frIe and complete circuation of the air. Again, it hba generally been found tAt large wards are bad, and that it is much better that thee should be a smnll number of patients in each ward. (Hear, er,) I I can only aure the Hens that this matter ha attsacted the serious attention of the Government, and that great pains have been taken to get men capable of giring an opinion upon it. The paper which my hon. frlend (Sir J. Ramsden) has agreed to produce will show what steps have been taken on the subject; but to a matter of auch imn portanoe as this great attention should be paid, so that the building shall be fit for the purpo to which it is intended, and the House may rest asured that we sball not with our eyes open erect an edific awhich hil be a sce of sickness and diseass, instead of a source of hoalth. (Hea, hear.) 3r. TITE aared the Hous tt a very general opInon had been expressed among practical men that, after al, the only good system of ventilation wa that of a fre circulation of natural air by means of open windows. (Hear, hear. A great and coAly experiment had been mado of a differeat system at Guy's Hospital, the leading feature of which was a large furnace butit had entirely filed; and, indeed, they had only to lookto the Houne in which they were msembled, where, after enotmous expenditure in experiments upon ventilAtion (hear, hear), recourse was at 1st had to open windows for a natural current of air, (Hear, hear.) So, again, with reipect to warming a building; he thought that was bmt done by means of an open fireplace in each departmenta and he saw no difficulty in applying those natral principles of ventilation and warming to the hospital at Netley. Sir D. NORREYS briefly replied. Sir F. SlITH said there had been 15 tenders sent in for the erectioin of the proposed building, and that between the bi b t, which was 266,0001, and the lowest, which was 168,00w., there had been no loe a differenco than 88,0001. The motion was then agreed to. ECCLESIASTICAL CODMSSION. Sir G. GEY moved for leave to bring in a Bil fnrther to amend the Act relating to the Ecclesiastical Commission. ers, and to continue the Act concerning the management of episcopal and capitular eates In England. The ohject of the Bill was to carry into effect the recommendations of the commissioners with regard to the leasng and management of ecdesiastical esttes The Bill was to some extent in unison with that which had been introduced by a noble lord (tbe Marquis of Blandford), and he proposed that the two Bills should be considered at the same time, with a view to the consolidation of their provisions and to the enactmeat of a measure which might effect a oonsiderable improvement in the exBting law. Mr. NEATE said he would offer his srenuous opposition to any Bill which would tend to faclitate the alienation of church property and to diminish the ability of the church to meet the demands which were made upon itis resources by an increasing population. The tenants of bishops and chapters, were setting up against the church and the publica cliUm of tenant right which was extravagant even in comparison with the wildest notions that prevailed In Ulaterand Connaught. He wished to know what discretion was left to the Church Estates Commissioners, under the existg law with regard to the sale or purchase of leases of ecclesastical property. Sir G. GREY said the Church Estates Commisdoners vere not oompelle to sell or purchase, and the object of the Iegislature had been to vest in the hands of the Ec clesiastical Commisioners and the Church Estates Commissioners such powersas would eneble them to render the property of the church most available for eccledsasical purposes. The terms upon which enfranchisement oould tepplacne wDerteflly detailed in the reports rwhich had been The motion was agreed to, and the Bll was brought in and read a first time. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS. Sir G. GREY, In moving for leaveto bring in Bim to promote the establishment and extension of reformatory schools in England, said he had introduced a smilar mneasure last session; and he had been sorry to find that it excited great apprehension on the part of many hon. gentlemen for whom he entertained sncer respect on account of the exertions they had made for the establiabment of institutions of this description. They pprehended that the powers proposed to be given by the mill to counties and boroughs tomaintain suchestablish. ments out of the county rates would tend to withdraw from existing institutions the voluntary snpport which they now received. His object was to provide for the rapid increase of these establishments. Representations had been made by magistrates that there were not in the neighbourhoods in which they resided any reformatory institutions to which they could send juvenile criminals Nothing could be further from his'wish than to interfere with establish: meints of this nature which were supported by voluntary ,contributions by creating rival Institutions to be mairitam'ed at the public expense. Hehid receivedlmany communicationsfrom gentlemen who tookan interest In the subject, and he proposednot onlyto authorize counties and boroughs to establish reformatories, but also to grant assist ance to existing institutions which had been established, or wbich it was Droposed to establish, by voluntary efforts The Bill would leave themanagement ofthe institutiousto be arranged between the originators who contributed to their support and the magistrates who made grants out of the funds at their disposal; but it would be required that when buildings were to be erected the plans should be approved by the Secretary of State for the Home Department before any aid was afforded from the public rates. Mr. ALCOCK thought this measure would entail an enormous expense upon counties. There were inthe county of Surrey last year 1,050 juvenile criminals, whose maintenance in gaol for an average period of 40 days each cost about 2,1001, but if 600 of these criminals-maikng a deduction of 450 for recommittals-had been sent to reformatories for three years the oounty would have been saddled with an expense of 45,0001. Mr. GARNETT expressed some apprehension that a charge for the maintenance of these institutions might be thrown upon the county-rates Sir G. GREY said that the only charge would be for the erection of the buildings themsdeves. Leave was then given to bring in the Bill, and it was broughtin and read a first time. COUNTY CESS (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill was read a second time. COURT OF EXCHEQUER (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill was also rcad a second time. JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES BILL The order of the day for the third readiug of this Bill having been read, Mr. BLAND moved that the order be discharged. The Bill, he said, was one which involved a great general principle, and which to a considerable extent affected vested rights. It had passed through its previous stages almost 'without discussion, and he was anxious therefore that a further opportunity of considering its provisions should be afforded before it passed into a law. Mr. WHiTESIDE said it wa impossible for him to vote forthe thirdreading of the Bill. He found the cvil estimates on the paper last might, and was informed that they would probably occupy the House two or three hours at least, but when hereturned he discovered, to his great surprisc, that this Bill had pased through committee. The was a piece of patchwork legislation, the object of which was to enable contributories to get a, person through whose instrumentality they maight compromise their liability for 5e. It was said, however, that the Tipperary Bank and the Royal British Bank would carry this Blfl against common sense and common justice. It was believed in Ireland that ever sincethe decisiou in the case of the Agricultural Bank every shareholder in a bank was liable to his last shilling snd his last acre for the debts of the bank. It was contended that this law was stil in force, and applied to the case of the Tipperary Bank. An appeal was now before the House of Lords for a decision on this question, and a petition had beea agreed to praying their lordships to fix an early day for the hearing of the appeal But w hile counselwerercady to argue this question, the Governmuent brought in a Bill which swept say aexiting rights. Hle was glad the attorney-General for England had mades up hi mind to prosecute the directors of the Royal Bnitish B,nik and he should rejoice to see them where they ought to be. He wished also that some gentlemen who were wting letters from Paris were given up by treaty, and whble the hon. and learned gentleman was preecouting criminally he should like to see Mr. James Sadleir receiv share of his attention, But what right had the House to say that any suitor who was likely to get 20s. in the pound should not have his appeal heard, and should be compelled to compromise his debt for 2s. 6d. in the pound? He believed that if the HoPse agreed to tho third reading of this BiE they would he malking a precedent of which ftey would be hereafter heartily ashamed. (Hear, bear.) Mr. MALINS said he had had chage of a Bil which applied to the Tipperary Bank last year, and from the tone ia which his lion. and learned friend spoke of that B;U it might be suppoeed that be 'as the agent of the Tipperary Bank, or that he had comeforard iu the matter for some sinister and improper purpose. (A laugh, and " No, no 1" from Mr. Whiteside.) It was true he was ussuessf,jl last year, gwing to be opposition of his hon. nd learned friend. and he believed that his want of saooess was deeply to be deplored The result of that had been that several share holders of the British Bank who were ready to pay much mnore than thesumsfor which they were rateably liable had been obliged to dispose oftheir businesses and ay their country. The hon. and learned gentleman (Mdr. 'Whiteside) had eaid that this Bill proceeded upon a princple qite newr to the English lw, but he seemed to forget that in every bankruptcy the assgnee had powrer, withe asnd o there creditors, to compound with the debtors. MIr. BA GW.ELL said that the creditors of the Tipperary Bank believed that this Bill wvould deprive them of their just rights against the shareholders of that bank, wfho w ere able to pay muuch more than 20s. in the pound. He there. fore entreated the Government not to pass it. Mr. WYLD pointed out that the representative must have the consent of the judge to any arrangement which he might make. Mr. SPOONER asked the hon. and learned gentleman tlhe Attorney-General whether this Bill, if passed, wouLld interfere with the appeal now pending before the House of Lods in the ae ot the Tipperary Bank. If it did he eouldnotsupportit. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL was very sorry thit hb had not tha honour of two minutes conversAtion with the tsinly not contraryto any rule of internationl lar (Hear, hear.) Leavo was then given to 'introdtice the Bill, which wrs afterwards brought in and read a first time. ENCLOSIURE ACTS AIiENDxENT. BIr. G.

Ellice). The reporL which had been laid Upon. the table of the House by the commissioners con. tained unquestionably a great deal that had strack the publo as both new And importnt, anad a greAt deal whioh demanded the serious consideration of the Legislature. With zespect to that report,. it was only due to the commis.ioners who prepared it to say that it- bore the marks of great ability, industry, and researchi and he thought thosegentlemen had laid the conntry under a deep obligstion for their services. As to the observations of his hon. friend (Mr. B.

Th. reportprOsented by the commissioners was never intended as, and was not, a report upon the oonduct of officials or of publdc mnen. The subject of theirinquir was as' te' the' sitat of the law and p'tactice of the lavw of hLinacy in Scotland, and the object of their report was to amenid that law,-an object for which he thought their report was mnoat admirably, calculated. To take that report, however, and make it asit stood thhe groundwork of graLve anseations against' officias who igtht be referred, to in. it, without knowing 'What explanAtion ormstement these officials m,ight make,l was to use it for an object for which it was r-everintndoed," ad for whic'h it was not idapt6d; because, while -many' of the tatLemnents contained in it were' maot Vale-' able as a basls for ' legislatihe r ir the commiseioneri, bad intended to inquire i itto the conduct of oicialrd their invSu igationH mudt have been muedh orenertensiVe and the' eXamination other p Ies much 'dex.

One would have imagined froai' the statement of his he, frienda the other evening that, while pauper lunatics in Scotland wr goss neglacw,bethe Board of Supervision had reprented the law as sofi-t rent and their administration of it as satisfactory.

Many of them were very short, becaseo they simply dsated thatthere were nolunatic asyilums rio private licended houses, and no provision whatever for tho reception of lunatics in their respective countie Sir Arcitbald Arhirn stated in. his rep l that he i -orded t( oa )oons Zeveryyear in Glasow, but that he had' been obliged.to disontianue one o them because the ommissionrs of supply woulcd not py the cost of both inspections.

(hear, hear.).. Now, one -word as to the state of matters when the commissi'on wappointod. It was well kown that Lordl Rutherforas Bil had been withdrawn in cosenqueno of the strong opposition which it had met with in Scotlnwind, ad, whstever the ground on which it was based, he must say that *i neerq recollected a more determined or general oaPosition to any measure. Whent he (the Lard-Advocateo ws a pointed to the office which henow held he was not hopetfu of being able to accomplish that which Lard Rutheiford had so completely failed to do; hut he resolved to wait and to seizethest nopportuniyof doigthat whicheach day'a experienetold him was morethaneverurgentl hre id. Irn the mantime Miss Dix, whose name no one col menrtion in connexion with this subject without the most sincere admiration (bear, hear), went to Edinburgh and requested that he woald interfare to obtain her aco to the asylrmms, asshewished torit them unaccompauled hy the sheriffi, and at a time when she was not erpectl (hlear, hear.) Her usual sagaci did not fail her ina miaking that request. In consequence of that appliation, and not ezactly seeing how he could authiorize her visits under those circumstances, he addressed a letter upon tse subject to his rigat hon. friendl the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He received in answer a statement that it wa proposed to appoin a commission; and on the lst of Marc, two cdays afterwards, he wrote stating that he should rejoica to see the commission appointed for the reonsmprentioned in his last; that it was very desirable that the smaller asylums should be suppressed (hear, hear), but that the way of effect ing the suppression required consideration, and that inqr was necessary repeting the outrages committed by lunatics at large. He h referred to the two previous measures for the purpose of showing that he was now, on the report of the commisaion to which ho had looked for aid in len lating, ouly carrying out the plan sketched byFis Predecesor about 10 years ago. le nasumedl that hont. gentlemeon were acquaintedi with the details of t'he repot, alid he thought he need not advert to the formeAr la, which was entirely and thoroughly Imperfect. The safepuards were simply these :-The sheriffs of the counties, the cltie, n some other parties had the power and duty of iseton.one or twice a-year; certain registers vere oreedt be kept and certain regulations made. But there Was no uniformaity. Every sheriff miight interret the Act as he pleased, and there was no obligation to erect asylums for the maintenance of lunatis. The dutY was thrown on the Procurator Fiscal of seeing tne Act executed, but no power was given him to ascertain whether it Was executed or not, and there was no power of visitation. He need not say that these safeguards entirely falled, and what he now kro,posod 'was that there should be appointed a commissioner, a medieal inspector, a secretary, and a 'clerk- and that these should cons-itute tho Lunacy Board of Scotland, though not under that ' name. It was not proposed to make the commissioner a member. of the board to the full extent in which, in England, a lunacy commissioner was ; hut it was proposed to mako him a corresponding momber with the ower of sitting at thoeboard, of communicating with the coard, and of writing on the part of tho board to the Englh board for the purpose of maldng inquiries.' It rasadso pro sedrgenOrallf to give the right of apeal, in case the'eorbined oonntiesdiffered from the cominisoneron certain. poits, to the Lunacy Commission in England. ' He had comm unicsate, to that comision niot all the details of the plan, but a general skretch of it, and he believed that tat commission. concurred in. it. These persons-the commissioner, the inspectorgeneral, the secretary, and clerk-being appointed, thecommissioner would have, in the first place, the power of granting and refusing licoenses, and the provisions would be as stringent as possible con, aistently with the public benefit. It was quite clear that the granting of these licenses had hitherto depended on the view which the sheriff for the time being might take of their duty. The sheriff of 31id-Lothian had stated that it vwas not the case that licenses had been granted as a matter of course, but it was obvions that the Inspector of Lunatics should, before licenses wero granted, have the power of in. uirieg into the nature of the building and the characterof the person keeping it. (Her, bear.) The commibsioner would havo the power of renewing maid ttransfrring thee licenses, and of revoking them, and also of maki%groles for the mianagement of the asylums, and of inquiring into the conduet of the officers. These matters would be reported to the Home Secretary. The commissioner would have a quasi-judicial power .1 iaqviring into cases under the Act, of sunisOnieg witnese, uan generally superlatending the district aSlums. 'he Jaspector-General would be hound to vist the aaimaa Wleait twrice a-year, and the whole of the. Fl a3ks wesmi entirely fall under the control ot the sear4iuajaSia Tb gezmerlexpenses~da b -to Scotland as thoy had been extended to Wal. (Har.) The authority of the Central Board should be conined to emng that tho law binding on tho loca authorities w7ea duly enforced. There was one paint to which the Lord Advocato had not alluded. The present horrible tem could not be effeotnaUy uprooted unleshy th p d o abomina. tion3, the licensed asylums for pauper lunatics. ond placed tho whole of their patients in ettablishment une direct control of the board. I the Lord dvocate suceded In paasing this Bill-and certainly tho public demanded the introduotion of a measuae on tbjet-h to take ca that its provnh ons werep into sriceuto He hoped that the learn R * toltho entire subject ofte ratet of pauperluais Mr. DP-Uat on D had hoard with regret the speech of the learned lord. Ita tone repemtbled the remark ox the hon. gentlemen who spoke last, who, in alusion to former niotions of his own ont this subject, said "that somethinig occurred, and so the thing -vent on," (Hear," and a lauthe les the English memnt rs to o the trouble to makerthemselves wasters of the details of this report, and nssed on justce being done to the pauper lunatics of scotland, this Bill never would be enforced, and matters would continue nt uch as they now stood. He (Mr. Drum. mendS adpreviously stated thaav there were 10 cases mon. tioed int hblue-book ofdire breachesof the law,whch it came -ithin the Lord Advocate's province to punish or correct; but the learned lord hinted that this wal an exaieretion, He had since taken the pains to rezd over again not only the report but also the appendix, end he found no fewer then 15 cases of direct and wilful breeches of e l He called attention to the aDppndix, becuse, th ogh it mas said that theze cases were not proved, there was not a single aduegation in the report which the eovience ino the appendix did net tupn 'Port. He had further said on A former occasion that ith Poor lw Board were chiefly responsible, and tbht se srtion he now repeated. The law direted that the paruhial bords should loge pauper inpatics in sutable aklsy s- end when the inspectors reported to the Board of Superva s eon, the latter bdy were empowered to act where the local authorities refused to do their duty. The blue-bock showed that the) sole aim-espocialy in the house where the patients were principally paupers-had evidently beein to acoMMOdato the gretes possible number at the smallest possible expense. The sving of money to the ratepay era, not the beefit of the poor, was the object sought 6hear, hear); and that, among other reasons, made him di,trust a separate board in Scotland. True economfy was no doubt a very right thingo but what was called economy In Scotland wa a prligi source of lnsanity. He charged the Board of Supervison with being tho creators of insnity, and the evidence before the House abundantly established that chmge. tPauperism and under-feeding acted powerfully in producing certain kinds of insanity, and many instanes mt ight be cited Iu wthich the dietary of the poor, espialy in the Highland districts, was miseambly deficient. The patients in the LU. bank asylum, inL the Lothians, were undorfedI and badly clothed. There weor numerous passoes to the same effect sattered through ther the wet ad inosquoteanother:- gIt never should be iorgotten that imperfect nutrition is one of th most frequent causes of inmsaity among the lwt the dietary of the peor was exclusively under the direction of the Board of Sup t on, and as that board did give insufficiont fvil ent fweroe manifestly more to blame in this matter than any other peison in Scotland. But the learned lord said, "True, the tredtment of these or creatures hs been atrocious---nothing eould ber mere dradfuln; but, then, there are doubts as to the construction of the Actk and evperbody has done what was right accrding to the mbst of his judgment." (A. laugh.) ehatever their other differences, they were al united on two things-n namely, in refusing to obey the law and in starving the poor. (Laughter.) He h been ix frequent communcation with the Lun.acy Commissioners in England, and they had informed him that many caes of iaproper treatment of lunatics existed which they could aot correct because they lhd no means of obtaining the necerd ary evidence Ttiht that i wastarwing eviwas apparentfrom the omany advertisements they saw in the newspapers, in which perons offered to receive old gentlemen and laes of weak minds.

Colonel CLappOeD said the Lunatic Board of Englnd was decirons of rendering to the learned lord every possible a,sstanrte In his efforts to amend the law of lued inay Scotland. the LORD ADVOCTE, inreplyto the observation that he had not anwered the cmaes of oppreon mentioned by the hen, member for St. Andrew's, sd that it was impossible to do so, because they were anonymous. The comemissioners had apped for the names for the purpose of inves. tigetion, but the.y were net given. If the Inspectors and medical officers appointed bya the Board of Supervion to report upon the sUtat of these asylums had failed in the discharge of their duty andamisled their emnployers, surely the whole of the blamea of the p resnt condcition of Scotch lunatics ought not to be imputed to the board. From year to year the board aed complained that the law was in. Mff.ctual, and itwas therefore disgraeful to the Legislature, - and not to the heard that these lunatics were hstmfully treated. (Hear.) Bat as was the state of the lunatics in Scotland, it was a gret deal worse when the Board of Super. vision began its labouisp Leave was given, and the Bill was brought in and read a fLrst time. TaRE LAW OF HIGHWAYS. p3r. manASSEY, in moving for leave to bring in a Bil to amend the lawa of highway, said that under the existing law those of the highways of the country which were not under the control of specia Acts of Parliment were regalated bv the Act of 18815, which was based on asystem of parochial management, bat which, in fact, had resulted in vesting the management of them In parochial surveyord. These officers were elected upon a low pecuniary qualification; they were men of no consideration whatever, of no special qualifications; and to say that they were unpaid officors was to say that they were incompetent officers. Besides sesit" after the repairs they had to cell vestries for assessin tle parish to the rate, they had to levy the rate, and to aischarge other duties connected with the highways, which would occupy the time of competent and skilful men. There was no proper audit of their accounts, all that was required of them bsing to verfy their accounts upon oath at the expiration of their year of office, and there was no power of disallowing their charges. The result had been to give rise to unive=sal dissatisfaction, and to a wish for the substitution of some better system for the present. The Poads had fallen into great disrepair, there had been a vast amount of jobbery, and the funds which ought to have been employed on the repair of the roads had been misappropriated. It would be perfectly idle to propose an alteration of the law which was merely based upon an amendment of the existing system, and accordingly he proposed to relieve -te parish surveyor entirely of the duties now imposed upon him, and to suabstitute a system similar to that which had been in action now for some time in South Wales, with such -alteratious as experience showed to be necessary. Ho proposed the appointment of district boards for the management of the highways. Then came a question as to the area over which those boards should have the superintendence. On the one hand they ought to avoid the narrow area that now existed, and which did not give sufficient scope for management; and, on the other, it was desirable not to spread the area over so wide a surface that the benefits of good management would be lost. He 7nad, therefore, endeavoured to attain as favourable a medium as possible. The hon. member for Petersfield (Sir W. Jolliffe), who held the same offlco under Lord Derbys Government that he (Mr. Massey) now did, left in his office Xa bil on this subject, and, knowing the great knowledge which he pocsessedregardingit.he had endeavouredasmuchas p ble to make the present BiU correspond with that of the ton. gentlemsa. The opinion of the hon. member for Petersfield was that the best mode of laying out the dis-tricts was not tofollowthedivisions of the boardsof guardians butthoseof thopetty sessions. Thisview hehadadoptedin the BilL With regard tothe constitution of the districtboards, he proposed that the magistrates in each district and the inemu bents of parishes should be cx officio members, and that the principle of representation should not be lost sight of, but theata way-warden should be elected by each parish. This, he believed, would give a board composed of persons who took an interest in the district, and who would gve their attention to the administration of the law. e next proposed that a surveyor with Competent practiealS knowvledge should be appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions, and that he, under the control, direction, and superintendence of the district beard, should have practically the maintenance of the hifrhways. Then. in order that the ratepayers should be satded that the funds wero properly managed, provision was made for an annual audit. practice had lately grown up-a very salutary practice- -of recognizing the efficiency and competency of corporate bodies to deal with matters of local interest, and therefore as regarded highwvays within municipal boundaries he pro- posed that the duty of superintending and managing them should devolve upon the town-councils. He had carefully -considered aU the objections which had been urged to former schemes, had endeavoured to avoid them, and in -this Bill had aimed at foUowing what appearod to be the sea&s of ParlAment and the exigencies of ccase Xrr. WAT f asked whether it was the intention of the hon. gentleman to interfere with the management of those roads at present under the control of metropolitan trusts. Mr. M SEY.-They are excepted. MIr. WATKIN reminded the hone gentleman that there vere 117 toilbas within six miles of the Post-office, and that 58,00.L was thus collected in 10,000,000 separate sums. This was naturally felt to be a great grievance. The Legislatr. had been applied to to remedy a simiar state of things in Dublin; and it w asfelt in London that the subject was onerequiring the attention of the Government. Hle would press ueon the hon. gentleman the propriety of adding another servie to these he was about to render, and to include the abolition of the tollbar nuisance in London in the Bill which he was now introducing. (Hear, bear.) Mr. ADAMS concurred in thinldkg that almost any ebange made inthe management of the highways must be for the better. The hen. gentleman, however, would, he hoped, avdid one great error which had inducedthe failure of other propositions; he ought to make the Board really an elective one and not swamp it by the addition of too many nominaid and ex officio members. (Hear, hear,) The area of petty sessions adopted would in many instances be far too wide a ono, and he would suggest that the hon. gentleman should extend his inquiries nmto the management of highways under the Board of Health, wben he would probably ind guite as great a necessity for making alterations there us in the pahial districts. With regard to the great majority of corporate towns the management of the highwys was neither in te hands of the parochial norofthecopoateoficrs,bu wa vstd i lca commisiner apoined nde th auhorty of local Acts of Poarlioment 'l'be hon. gentleman vvould probably find here also that there was as much misconduct aoDg these commissionen, eS amongprochilofficc, aud it would be worth consdering v,hether it would net bo necessary to izterfere ith auch locI Act, a,ud to take the management away from these commuissioners. MIr. SLANEY felt grateful to the hon. gentleman who introduced the Bill, which he believed was a beneficial one, i but suggested that some provision should be made for foot- ! h an, if posdible, that tollbar shouldi oeremoved fuzther fDom London.l leave was theu given to introduce the BilL. CONVEYANCE OF LAND FOR CHARITABLE 'USES. Mr. ATHERTON asked for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the law relating to the conveyance of land for charitable uses. The Bil he proposed was, with some alterations, and, as he believed, amendments, the same as those to which the House had agreed in 1855 and in 1856. Under the old laws land devoted to charitable or religious uses became inalienablo, and when those laws were altered various devices wereadopted to continuo the trasts. To meet the evil of land lying in mortmain the 9thof George IL, cap. 26, was pased. That statute had continued to the present time to be practically the mortmain law of the country. The main and primary object of that Act was to prevent those deathbed bequests of land to charitable and religious uses which were found to prevail t the time, and It provided in effect that nO land should be dedicated to charitable uses except by deed. That part of the law he (Mr. Atherton) proposed to leave as it stood. Tho Act of George IL thon proceeded to mnake certain provisions and to impOse certain restrictions with reference to the dadication of land to those purposes by deed; but there was a difference betwean the case of a loenu fide sale for a valuable consideration and the case of a voluntary gilt, and the reasons which rendered restrictions necessary in one case did not generall apply to the other. In this v-ew he was suprptedfby the report of a select committee whioh sat in. 852, and whlch recommended that all restrictions should be abolished in the case of bon4 fide sales. The Act of George II. imposed a number of stringent restrictions with respect to the conveyance of laud for a valuable consideration. In tho prosent Bil ho proposed to make a distinction between deeds relating to land conveyed for a valuable consideration already executed, and deeds hereafter to be executed. In the case of past doods he dispensed with a variety of restrictions, but he proposed that if not already enrolled they should be enrolled within 12 months from the psasing of the Act. In the case of futu deed of that sad he & dispensed with certain requirements of the old statute. With respcct to the conveyance of lands not for a valuable consideration the requirements) were much the same as those provlded by the Act ,of George IL, with the additional provi61on that the deed must be executed 12 months prior to the death of the grantor. Under the existing Aot the grantor or conveyer was prohibited from making any reservation for his own benefit. Suppose that in a ming district a site was wanted for a chapel, schoo or church it was not competent for the person granting tn surface for a charitable urpose to reserve theminerals for himself, nor even the right of wy. Stipultions also as to the formations of streets, or partlcularcLases of buildings, drainage, and the like, were prohibited. It was his obect to remove theso restrictions in specifio instances, wich he thought produced inconvenience. It had been the practice in many cases where persons were not dis posed to make public the objoct of the obarity to execute a deed conveying the property, and another making a trust. The deed enrolled was the conveying one, but he proposed that where the deeds of that kind existed the deed de claring the trust should be enrolled, and he proposed an analogous provision with respect to deeda already executed. Hebeieved thoeBill had been DUtinasha toca out not uncreditably his intentions, and he hcd 0557 estion eshesitation In saying so, as he had had the advantage Of some suggestions from the Attorney.General, andw also of two gentlemen cennected with the Statute L^aw Comission. Leave was then given to introduce the BiL NETLEY HOSPITAL. Sir D. NORREYS rose to move for en address to the Crown for return respecting Netley Hospital, showing by whom the site was selected, whether any reports were made on its saubrity and general eligibility for its purpose previeus to selection, and by whom; by 'whom tho original plas 'were prepared, whet her they were submitted to anymedical autority for approval, by whom they were offlcially mnctioned, and whether any report was made upon them, and by whom, previous to their bein6 sanctioned; also for a statement of the alterations of or additions to the original plans which have been doetrmined on, by whom they were recommended, to whom they were referred for approval; and for a copy of correspondence or reports relating thereto which have led to the adoption of the amended plan He said that as he understood the motion would not be opposed it would be unnecesay for him to make any formal statementon a subject respectingwhich he personally knew nothing. (A laugh.) He based bis motion on the assertion of an hon. member a few nights ago, that the site of Netley Hospital was Improperly chosen, belng most 'nsalubrious; that no reference had been made to the proper medical authorities; and that the plan had been so badly drawn up that the estimato of 150,000& orlglnallylaidbefore the Househadbeeninoreod byllO,OOO. . isobjectinmaklng the present motion was to give the Government an oppor tunity of removin that'wich was a rmot disgraceftl Imputation on the offidal departments of this country. (gear.) He was informed tha as far as the salubrity of the site Was concerned the Government made every effort to be satisfied on the point. As to the plans there could be but one opinion, that whenever plans were laid before the House they ought to be carefuRly drawn ul in order to avoid additions being made to the estimate. Bear, hear.) The estimates for the public ofimces would soon be before the House, and when the dog-days had come and nine-tenths of the members had gone out of town those estimates would be brought before them. (Laughter.) Then, when thhe House was nearly emp ,supplemental estimates would be brought in. (Hear, hear. IHe heard some gentleman talk about a niodinval pln for Netley Hospta, but he trusted that those who had to sanction the plan for the hospital, would not have the bad tastetoaricaturetheruisof 11etlAbbey by placing a medhievalhospital near it. The hon. member conduded by proposing his motion. Sir J. RAMSDEN aid there was no intention on the part of the Government to oppose the granting of these returns, which he hoped would be the means of removing a misapprehension that prevailed with respect to Netley Hospital. To the report that the site for tho hospital was chosen without proper consderation he could give the most decided contradiction. The site was not selected by any Government official at all, but by a gentleman of very high standing in the medical profession, who was directed to choose within certain limits the most eligible situation for a hospital. That gentleman made a report, and the site was chosen in accordanoe with his recommendation. He had so recently explained the caruse of the discrepancy between the original estimate and that now presented to Parliament that he should not be justified in wasting the time of the House by repeating the statement. Mr. STAFFORD said that the return moved for by the hon. baronet was exactly the return which he could wish, and, if honestly prepared, which he had no doubt it would be, could not fail to afford some important information to the House. Upon a former occasion he stated that certain extensive alterations were made, or attempted to be made, in the hospital at Netley after the erection of the foundation and a considerable portion of the superstructure. That was a serious charge to make against the Government, and it was desirable and necessary that it should be supported. If the House would permit him to read the grounds upon which he made that assertion, and upon which he now ventured to adhere to it, he would be glad to do so; but the document to which he had to refer was one of several pages (cries of " Oh !"), and there might be an impatience on the part of the House, after the varied and interesting subjects to which its attentionhad been called that evening (a laugh), to enter so largely into the paper v'hich be held in his hand. (Hear, hear.) The document in question, of which he would merely state the substance (hear, hear), was forwarded to Lord Panmure by all the medical men of the Middlesex Hospital, an institution second to none for its management and its construction. It entered into details with respect to the construction of the Netley Hospital; it stated that every one of the wards had to receive the air either through the corridor or else through windows looldng to the north-east, which was well known to be the aspect least favourable to the recovery of patients. It severely criticized the height and width of the wards, the position of the rooms assigned to the orderlies, the whole system of ventilation, and the confined court, not extending above 170 feet, into which the windows of all the wards looked. It described the system of latrines as so dangerous that there would be eonstantly throughout the bulding what was called an hospital atmosphere, inwhich it would be impossible for the attendants to maintain their health, or for the sick to escape from fever, gangrene, and other diseases. (Hear.) He would move for a return of this document, in order that it might belaid before Parliament in ea*ngo, or that Government night take the responsibility of refusing it. It was sined by gentlemen whose names commanded so much respect, and w o were of such great celebrity, that it was fitting he should refer to them more particularly than he had yet done. They were Drs. Francis Hawkins, eth Thompson, and A. P. Stewart, physicians to the Middlesex Hospital; Messr. Alexander Sbaw, Campbell, De Morgan, and Charles H. Moore, surgeons to the Hospital; Drs. S. J. Goodfellows and Henry Thompson, assistant pyicans; Mr. Mitchell Henry, assistant-surgeon; Dr. 1. T. Frere. physician aoocheur - and Mr. George Corfe, apotheeary. But, further corre- spondene htui passed between these gentlemen and the Seeretary-at- War. He held in his hand their last onm. mumocaton to Lord Panmure, which, he was sorry to say, had tot been favoured with an answrer. (Hear, hear.) It'was dated the 4th of Mlay, 1857, and commuenced as "We have the honour to inform your lordship that a deputation from our body attended, on Tuesday, the 28th, at the War-office, on the subject of the proposed Royal Victoria Hospital. Captain Laflan explained I o us the nature of certain alterations which the military authorities had decided upon making in the internat arrangements of the building, and especially in the position of the latrines; and he also entered at considerable leng-h into the system of artificial ventilation which he stwed would probably be ultimately adopted." He might here mention that the plan of Captain Laffan was to draw the cold air from a field in the vicinity by means of an enormous tunnel (a laugh), and to suck it up through the building by means of vastfurnace placedonthe top or the hospital, every window, ofounrse,beingkeptshut.

TO THE RDI1:OR OF THE TIMES Siz,-You will probably prevent sundry new members of Parliament from being " vlotimizecV if you will kindly give publiclty to the following attempt (one of many) which hua come -nder my notice since my return to the Eonus of CommoDs. A respectably dressed middle-aged woman called upon me and represented herself as the sister of one of my active constituents, and stated that her husband had died the evening before in Brompton ConsuHptio s Huopitai, and that she was anxious to raise enough mone. to pay the undertaker to take eharge of the body, which eie was obliged to remove by 4 o'clock that afternoon. The ap licant mentioned circumstances connected with myelac=o which oould only be known by persons on the spot, sad I eintertained no doubt of her being what she representea her. Eelf to be. Having, however, been repeatedly deceivecd in such applications,I declined to give her money, but offered to write to the secretary of the hospital, and that after I haad written to her reputed relatives I would relieve her if I found she dEserved it, When writing the note to the secretar, I incidentaly I named to a friend wbo sat near me what I was about, aud he explained that he had had a visit from a woman a few days before witb a precisely sim ilar tale, only bringing m. troductions from another part of the country. I intreduced my friend to the room where the woman was waiting, and he at once identified her, andan apulioation to the SecretaWr of the Brompton Bospia has confdrmed the susi,cio that shoe is an impostor.

LORDON, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 1T51. In the HIoise of Lords last night, Lord ELtB]OROruGH called t'he attention of the 13ouse to the reported mutinies in the Indian army, 'which, if true, he attributed to an apprehension oa the paut of the native population that the Gavemu
India, in common with all the rset of Asia, has ever been more liable to revolution than Europe. It has been more the prey of conquerors, and that to a much more recent date; it has surrendered more easily and totally to foreign masters, and more quickly learnt to .revere dynasties alien in religion, language, and race, than any country in this part of the world. No doubt this is owing to the gentleness of the Hindoo character, and to the original want of a political unity and faith. The lesson of such a retrospect ought not to be lost upon the present masters of India, for what they have gained in one century they may lose in another. Lord ELLnsoiouGH, however, would find it difficult to point out a precedent to justify the very grave apprehension of instant and terrible danger which he sought to impress upon Government last night. The revolutions of India have not been the work of a day; rebellion has never spread like wildfire across the Peninsula; there is not that freemasonry in its races and religions ; and, in fact, ludia never has in a moment thrown off its lords, and then looked for others. It has not even originated a spontaneous rebellion, like that of China, worldng its way at the rate of a province a-year. There is, then, no reason to imagine that the idle pretence of contact with forbidden substances caught at by a few mutinous soldiers, or even such an untoward event, were it possible, as a successful conspiracy against the local authorities or the European forces at a particular station, would produce a general and instantaneous disaster. Within a very few years we have witnessed several occasions on which our Indian fellow-subjects, had they thought themselves oppressed, had they been united and ready to co-operate, and had they felt the least wish or hope for independence, had all the opportunity that fortune could possibly offer. Our reverses in Affghanistan, the attempted invasion of the Sikhs, the long conflict between the Mahomedans and the Hindoos in the kingdom of Oude, and the Santal rebellion, all supplied the brand for a general conflagration, had India been the magazine of mischief that some have described her. Experienco rather shows that a long succession of follies, violences, wrongs, and neglects can there be committed without bearing their legitimate fruit so manifestly and presently as they would in other parts of the world. We need only point to the fact that for some generations -we have had an ecclesiastical establishment in India, clergy committed to the duty of spreading their faith, and schools in which at least the language of our Scriptures was taught. Yet India has borne it with scarcely a murmur of suspicion or discontent. What, then, is the danger? We have already expressed our opinion on this point, and nothing Lord ELLEBNOROUGu has said can lead us to think him better informed upon it. No doubt the Hindoo population, and particularly the soldiery, containing, as the latter does, all the more irregular and excitable elements of the population, and the actual survivors of predatory tribes, require to be ruled with a strong hand. The European officers ought as much as possible to be present with them, to occupy their minds, to engross their attention, and engage their affections. In the dangerous tranquillity and tediousness of peace the officers, so far from seizing the opportunity for protracted absences and frivolous or profligate amusement, ought to give double care to enforce discipline, to keep up habits of activity, to inspire respect for authority, and sustain, themselves, that military spirit which actual war wil keep up of itself. We all know what young British officers can be in their own country; we can imagine what they may become in an enervating climate, without anxious occupation, and with many opportunities of mischief; we know from sufficient sources what the Hindoos are themselves. We have only to put these things together,-we cannot help doing so, and we have at least the means of understanding how it is that regiment after regiment of the native forces is reported to be in a state of disaffection. If a master neglects his school it is sure to fall into disorganization; if the head of a mercantile business becomes slack in his personal superintendence it soon goes to wrack and ruin; if the authorities of a town take it for granted that all is right it will soon be a nest of thieves. In the East indolence is almost a necessity of the climate, vice more precocious than here, and decay more rapid. So we cannot doubt that the absence or carelessness of officers in regiments, not too well officered to begin with will inevitably tell very quic'kly in the insubordination of the simple native soldier. This, in our humble opinion, is the real danger; and Lord EiLLnsoRouan's alarm as to the missionary projects he attributes to Lord CANNING can only have the effect of diverting attention from it. A low standard of duty in the officers cannot but tell on the army. It tells even here, where the natural character of the British soldier, and the whole force of surrounding opinion, combine to counteract the bad example or neglect of those in command. It must, then, tell in India, where the soft, ductile character of the Eindoo, waits for irapressions, and in the absence of a good model and salutary instruction is sure to fall, by mere lapse, into any delusion or temptation that offers itself. There never was a people s9 easily governed. We should not have acquired the obedience, the confadence, and even the affection of 170,000,000 people, had they not possessed a wonderful pliancy of temper, and had we not also had within ourselves some natural gifts of command. Here, then, are brought together all the elements of an unbroken peace and a durable dominion, and there must be some very positive fault, some gross misrule, to produce the deplorable events said to have taken place. Even if the reports be true to the fullest extent, we have no fear of serious consequences. It is better, indeed, to be on the safe side, and we trust Government will remember that British Idia has increased much of late years, that the demands on its army have increased on all sides, and that the native forces have also been consi&rably augmented without a proportionate increae 'of the Eturopean forces. We cannot pretend to hold a seventh of the human race with no greater number of Britie soldiers than was, lately thought but a poor contingent b send to. the siege of Sebastopol. We ought to, have more men in India. But it is even more important that measures should be taken to keep the European officers of the native army fully up to their duty and their work. The very natux, of the delusion alleged in this instance convicX these officera of neglect. They cannot have had proper communication with their men, tby cannot have won the confidence of their men, or gained access to their understandings, if the htter have generally imbibed so ridiculouis an idea as that England was destroying their castes and undermining their religion by means of greased cartridges. A word as to the penalty inflicted on tle offenders. People hear in this country with much satisfact,ion of a native regiment disbanded and sent no oae knows where for a few acts of thoughtless follU,. But people are not generally aware of the w,verity of this punialunent. The Sepoys so ds'banded, lJaq all their claims on thoe ompapny, aua such as are advanced in years, as many, eipecially of the native officers, are, pay with their lives for the madness of an hour. The pension is their only resource, and without it they must starve. Will not a recurence of such examples, misemble enough in themselves, suggest a doubt of the Company's faith, as if it were seeking for a pretence to evade its obligations, the just performance of which has been always described as our principal hold upon Hindoo respect and allegiance ? Let the Company be wisely consistent; let it extend the penalty to all who deserve it. Let it put all the European officers on half-pay, seeing that their neglect is the chief cause of these misfortunes. We have heard it said that nothing would produce so salutary an effect upon the Company's service. So far from its being unpopular, or diminishing the confidence of Englishmen in the honour of the Company, we believe that it would be hailed as a triumph of juatice.
Thedebates on theArmyEstimateshave brought to light a notable piece of administrative economy. It had been resolved to provide the country with a Military Hospital-not a bad decision in itself, for events had shown how much we had to learn in this respect, and some good institution where the principles of military surgery and nursing could be practically studied might naturaUly be attended with advantages over and above the relief of its particular inmates. Well, the vote originally pioposed for the purpose was 150,0001., but it appeared that the expense of the building was to exceed its first estimate by no less than 110,0001.,andthat, inttead of lS5,oooo.,it waato cost 260,0001. This was something, but not all. Thesite selected for the new invalid establishment was Netley, on the banks of the Southampton Water, where acres of mud, as a matter of course, are uncovered for so many hours daily to the pestiferous action of the sun. Mlr. STArPoED, whose experience at Scutari has given him some insight into realities of this kind, enlightened the House a little upon the Hospital at Netley. "It was begun," he said, " in utter defiance and ignorance of all those "principles of sanitary knowledge which we had "learnt by bitter experience during the last few "years. Its site was chosenvwithout anyreference to " medical authorities. When the building was com" menced the attention of those who ought to have "been consulted, and who had the interest of the "British aoldier at heart, was drawn to it, and it " was found necessaryto make so many important " and costly alterations that the Government con" sented to spend 110,0001. more upon it. Even " this increase, he believed, would not be suffiEcient "to build it in the manner in which it ought to "be built." A very pretty story this, but there is more to come still. The expenditure already incurred upon the new Hospital is reckoned at 70,0001., and it is now rumoured that, as far as regards the Netley site, the undertaking is to be abandoned. So much for economy when there is a bottomless purse to draw upon; and yet we hope to tako off the Income-tax in 1860 ! We shall hardly be thought to make the matter much better, perhaps, when we say that the abandonment of the project, even at the sacirfice of so many thousands, is about the best course that could be pursued. Netley was never a desirable situation, and, though the establishment of a large Military Hospital was certainlya judicious design, there was no necessity for going to Southampton Water for the purpose. The fact is, we have a Hospital already built on a most convenient site, with excellent approaches, admirable grounds, and acckmmodation of the most satisfactory kind. It belongs to the nation, it is devoted to the, service of the Army, and it is even ca1led a Hospital as it is, though the terr happens to be interpreted according to the ancient, rather than the modern meaning of the word. We speak of the institution at Chelsea, and, however the idea may scandalize certain sentimental notions at the first blush, we make bold to sav that there is not one of the many interests connected with the proper administration of the Army which would not be advanced by such a metamorphosis as we refer to. Of course it will be asked what is to be done with the Pensioners-with those gallant veterans who there enjoy an honourable retreat after devoting their best days to the service of their country? We reply that if the matter could ba decided by the votes of these very people it would not be left many hours in abeyance. Chelsea Hospital was no doubt an excellent establishment in its origin, well intended and well worked; but experience has now taught us that all such institutions entail expenses which would make the objects of the inatitution far more comfortable elsewhere. What may have been the case in early times it is difficult to say, but at present it is perfectly certain that the great object of such establishments-viz., the relief and sustenance of soldiers who are past duty and have deserved support, could be attained at infinitely less cost to the country, and with far greater satisfaction to those concerned, by the simpie payment of a pension without any of this costly apparatus. If a hospital provides the discharged soldier with a residence it also imposes upon him many obligations of discipline with which he would rather dispense, and it keeps him at a distance from the scenes and kindred among whom he would naturally wish to close his days. All this while the cost of the fabric, with its staff of officera and retainers, not to mention the value of the site, so swells the demand upon the Exchequer that the mere maintenance of the soldiers is lost in the total. Half the money expended directly in Densioning the same number of men would render them all far happier and far more independent. They could carry their pensions with them to such part of the country as they pleased, and, being thus enabled not only to support themselves without appeal to others, but even to render perhaps some little service to those around them, they would tnjoy a position equally assured and far more comfortable than that of Pensioners in a Hospital. We need not be at much pains to prove this proposition. What is thought of the difference between indoor relief and outdoor relief we see clearly enough in the operation of the Poor Law. In that case the object is to make the receipt, of assistance unattractive, and outdoor relief is meaaured with jealousy accordingly ; but in the case of soldiers' pensions- the object is of an opposite kind, and it is indoor relief which should be abolished aa far as possible. To keep up a great Hospital E part of a pension machinery is to spend a sovere upon the process of giving away half-a-guinea. On the other hand, if the Chelsea establishment were converted into a Hospital irl the medern acceptation of the word, we believe, the plan.would unite as many advantages as any single schema could combine. The accommnofation, as we have already said, is excellent, the place is accessible by water, it is already Governrjent property, andwhat is a consideration of I' o small importanc-the vicinity of the metropoli j would enable its staff of surgeons to keep up ~their standard of practice by constant colummlica tion vith the great civil Hospitals of Lond,jn. All professional skill is enbanced by cent*ralization. A Military Hospital at Chelsea wonuti be a real school of military surgery, and our invKjIded soldiers would get the benefit of all thb.t science could accomplish for their relief- Yor need the change offend even the most ardent a:"mirers of the antique or the pioturesque. 29 ti'.ne-honoured traditions need be violated. UW:ea EQspita might be Chelea Hospital still- an institution devoted to -the comfort ofthe soldier, and realizing the design of. its foundation with far more completeness than at present. It cannot be maintained that a large establishment like this is a necessary instrument for providing soldiers with their pensjioxis ;'on the contrary, it abstracts and. absorbs an immense proportion of the funds which might otherwise go directly into the Pensioners' pockets; but, if it were made a laospital for the medical treatment of invalided soldiers, it might confer the greatest benefits upon the Army at large. It is quite clear that wo have much to learn in sanitary science as applied to mi'itary administration. Mr. SiDwEvYnruB tells us, that-though the Army was recruited from picked men, in the very prime of youth, and certified free from malformation or disease, the mortality among them was greater than among the average specimens of tihe same age and class in civil life. What, again, may be accomplished by good sanitary regulations in combating these liabilities, even in their very worst form, was shown in the Crimea, where improvements of this description sufficed to render an encampment once so terrible as healthy as any station at home. These are the studies which we. should like to se. pursued, and a good. Military Hospital at Chelsea, removed, as it would be, fromwtho turmoil of the metropolis, and yetwitbinthe sphereof its sientific attractions, would probablypromote these desirable objects no less effectually than the immediate relief of the soldier.
Hlow woula the Oxford "Dons" of the lut century, or even those whoruled the University at the commencement of the present, have atared in wonder and amazement could they have been present in the Congregation of Friday at the reception of the new Statute for connecting the University with middle-class education throughout the country I Those grave and ponderous gentle. men in wigs who look down from the grandeur of their gilt frames upon Hall dinners-how. would they have opened their eyes in amazement at the proposal that Oxford should enter intc relations with commercial schools, admit their aZumni to her notice, institute examinations for them,. aud reward them with certidficates, titles, and honours 1 "How are the "mighty iallen r1 they would indeed exclaim. " What has Oxford to do with such vulgar know"ledge as that of English grammar, arithmetic, " geography, and the low currictlum of middle"class schools? English literature, indeed! "English Readers! Gol&mith andPinnockJ Isthe " seat of the Muses really to be polluted with such " a connexion as this l Is classical ground to be "vulgarized in this way-the plain of arthon to "be sown with potatoes, and the very 'Academical "' Grove' which listened to the wisdom of Peri"patetics and Stagyrites to be turned into a "farmyard 1" How would these ancient worthies, from the rigid and lean scholrs in his closfitting black gown who presided ove- the theological disputations in the reign of JAmr L, to the fullblown, portly, and powdered Head of a House of 40 years ago, exclaim at such a degradation as this I What would the am JAcKsowis have said, and the Bishop Hoirs-s, and the Regius Professors of that day, and the polite Academicians of the school of GRAY and WARTOx ? How entirely would scholastic divinity have agreed with Greek Iambics, the orators with the poets, and the philosophers with the dilettanti in denouncing such a step ! Such, however, is the object of a Statute which hasjust passed theHebdomadalCouncil, and appears to have been received with favour in the University. It is generally agreed that, while upper-class education and lowe-class education have received the greatest attention in this. country, middle-class education has been. leftentirely to itself4 without any of the advantage of new thought or any stimulus from higher quarters. The commercial schools which educate the majority of these classes have suffered under the disadvantage of private speculation as their source, without any assistance from the public centres of education and knowledge. Bnt private speculation, unassisted and unchecked, is not a safe conductor of education. It is evident how much people are left under such circumstances to the mercies of qu'ackery and puffing. Indeed, the incompetence of this class of schoolrasters has been quite a jol;e for ages. The "COiizen of the World," nearly a century ag,o, complained that a man who had tried trade after trade, andbrokendown inevery one, as a lastresource set up the trade of schoolmater. And this state of things is not s9 much altered now. Bankrupti and broken-down tradesmen, men who have failed under the matter-of-fact ordeal of practical business, are constantly now the men who set up our middle-class schools, looking for success in that department when they have failed in every other, simply because there is no definite test here to try them. In the haze and mistiness of the subject they escape without detection, favoured by the mass of ignorance which still exists as to what a good education is. They have only to make loud pretences, advertise some new method, pretend to some extraordinary eecret, and puff themselves off in large capitals, and they attract a crowd of pupils. It will be a great publie advantage, then, if an influence from the highest public seats of education can be brought to bear upon middleclass education, in order to raise its present low standard, and if some good established public test can be applied to control it, and bring the chancemedley of materials into somethingHike shape. Such is the object of the new Oxford Statnte, which creates a system of examination of which these schools arc> invited to avail themselves. The examinations will, of course, be conducted by members of the Uihiversity, and will be two in number every year-one for youths of 15, and the other for youi&s of 1S; the firsb being to test the soundness of the elementary instruction given in the middle-class sshool, the- second to furnish the young men with a testimonial on their entranco into Iffe. Besides the stationary examinations held regularly at Oxford, a migratory examinatiox is. also- proposed, the University sending down exminers to the spot, when there is proper cal for them. The general relt of the s;stem 'will be a double one-that of test for the school and! stimulus for te boys. The plan wila work, iua reality, like a, plan of public inspection,. because. the resuLa of the examination will show, Ithe forwardness of the boys and the attention. whic has, beee paid to them,; and schools wAich sena up succesul pupils to these examinations will, fccourse, appealto thistest of their efficiency. It will be the best sort of advertisement for them. It is thought that the classes for whoma benefit the scheme is intended will appreciate & pubei teat like this, and naturally give their patronage accordingly, and thus that t3e stimulus of self-interest will bring the middle-clas achoolmaster under the influence of the scheme. The new Statute is one among many signs of the times,-many notes of a change passing over the spirit of our old institutions. The Universities havo hitherto courted aristocratical favour, and their great boast and pride have been that they have trained the young scion of nobility and the heir to wealth and aplendour. But now they appear to see-for the sister University is said to be joining in the new movement-that institutions which are to last in this country must make6 themselves generally useful, and encounter the dust of the active scene in which we live. They seo tbat a hold upon the g t waiddle clam in ihis country isi-znamportant advantage, and a pledge for their own stability which they cannot afford tg pas by. Farewll to the enclosed garade im which learning. rwlked of old, to' the Epicurean paradise of sebolars, and the *niooth and ffowery walks., of leisure aud criticism, iudulging, their own tastes and fancies without mympathy with the vulgar.world I . Harder times and busier calls have now opme. These choice aies o£ intellectual empIoymGot were very good and becoming in their way; socint ought never to wish to se them obsolete, anS we hope that the Universities, with ll the changeas which are coming upon them, will retai them. to~ the last. lBt other needs, and more rough:- and urgent ones, are now felt, and must be attended to. Our old. Universities posew a prestige which belongs to no other seats of education. Let tbem use it. They may make miuch of it if they come forward in time, and pat themselves at the head of the movement before another chief has appeared. This is their truest policy. There is at the bottom of the popular mind in this country, with all its progress, a respect for ancient institutions. We value what is established and haa stood the test of time; and, if our old institutions know howrto uw this feeling, they will find the benefit of it.

Vavin, eighth; EL Ferdinand de tasteyrie, ninth; and Xi. Emile Olivier, tenth. This list was adopted at a meeting of the leading men of the Democratic party this morning, and will probablybe soon given to the publicofficially. The Govermment candidates are the same as at the last election. In consequence of the recent modification in some of the districts a new one has been added, and here also an opponent to the Government candidate will probably be started. Of the success of the opposition I do not venture to say much. Paris, however, has always been remarkable for choosing, at all periods, and almost under every r6gime, Republican and Monarchical, representatives in opposition to the Government of the day. Even under the Convention the Parsians returned members whom Prudhomme described as a disgrace even to that body; and in our own day we have meen them vote for one of the prominent leaders of the terrible insurrection of June, 1848-thowe same bourgeois whose brothers, sons, and friends were sliot down at the barricades a short time previously. The nature of the Parisian is opposition, and it su&ficesforany one to be in authority to reckon upon his hostility. In the above list there are names of much respectability, and to some of whom the Parisians owe a debt of gratitude. They are mostly men of independent character and of hberal principles. At all events, they deserve credit for the courage with which they put themselves forward with such odds as are against them. Of the chances of the Liberal party in the departments it is equally difficult to say anything. There is some perplexity and even confusion among the Government nominees. The Government, or, as M. Granier de Cassagnac observes to-day in the Coasfitutionme, the Bmperor, has already proclaimed his list of candidates; but so many are likely to start in the same interest that the Prefects are puzzled what to do or whom to favour. It is a perfect embarras de richsses. There does not seem to be a perfect understanding between those functionaries and their immediate chief, the Minister of the Interior. The Prefects naturally enough recommend their own particular friends, and the Minister is charged with being too yielding to their exigencies. That there is some misunderstanding is evident from the fact that while the Siece and otherjournals of the capital discuss the question of the elections, several of the provincial papers, complain that they are prohibited from doing so. This occurs, no doubt, from the excessive zeal of those functionaries, some of whom are more Ministerial than the Government itself. Baron Mariani, Ohevalier d'Elonneur of the Princess Baccioochi, and the Government candidate for the new circumscription given to Corsica, has issued a circular to the electors. In it the Baron states that the Emperor himself supports him, and that if anybother person should present himself he would be guilty of an act of opposition to the sovereign ill. The circular is accompanied, by way of support to its contents,bythe followring letter, addressed to the Baron by the Emperor . "Tuileries, May 9. "My dear Commandant,-The Mnistr of the Interior has doubtless informed you that I have decided that you hall be the Government candidate in Corsica. You mniy therefore loudly proclaim it, for I shaU be very happy if the confidence of the electors places you inthe Chamber. Rely on my sentiments of friendship. " NAPOLEON." Dr. Conneau, the Eaperor's physician, has also written a letter to his uncle, M. Horace Sebastiani, strongly recommending Baron Mariani. The Dbt.s has at last broken the silence it so long maintained. It declares againzt abstainingfxromthe ballot. The following extract betrays some discouragement - " We have very little to expect from the elections of 1857 ; the country will elect deputies because it is oalled npon to do so. Let it not be supposed we imagine that the eleotions of 1857 are aboat to restore to Liberalsm the strength and vigour of former days, We are far from entertaining the illusion. Were we called upon to draw up the scale of heat possessed by Liberalism in the country our task would not be encouraging. In this scale the country would be below zero, at freezing point; Government would be a little above the country, and the Emperor above the Government. We shall therefore not have a Liberal Chamber. The country cannotproduce one, and, were it t) be produced, it would speedily tire out the country and be considered a burden. .. , . We do not promise our Liberal friends who may enter the Legislative Body much pleasure or glory. United to the Liberals of the former Legislative Body, they will have the sole honour of main. tabning their opinions and of biding their time. Will this honourable and obscure rUce, which speaks to the conFde ce rather than to -anity, tempt many persons? We do not consider it temptlng, but we believo that no per. son has the right to refuse it, if offered to hin, excepting a small number of men who are forbidden by the glory of their past life from entering the new Chamber. We do not see what the Duo de Broglie, what M. Guizot, M. Thiers, M. Berryer, and several others could do in the Legislative Body. Abstaining is convenient, and therefore we tremble before it. It responds to the taste of the country, which accepts and deserts things with passion. To do nothing, and to blame everything, is a role agreeable to vanity and idleness. If we are of opinion that those 'who may be named deputies should accept the fanc. tion, we hold with greater reason that the electors should perform their duties. The evil -which now preys on our country is carelessness. We have withdrawn from public affairs with inconceivable distrust, zeserving to ourselves tho privilege of coveringeverything with cruelblame. We say that we are not responsible since we do not act. This is a seri. ous error. We are responsible for our carelessness, and by the latter shall we be justly punished. Read the last volume of N. Thiers, the 15th volume of the History of ate Empire We trace in every page the great lesson that France suflereI frightfully at the end of the Empire because she had con. fided her destiny too cormpletely to the great man who governed her. She had abdicated too much, and she wa3 punished for her abdication. We do not compare periods or events, we are of those who openly prefer the second Empire to the first, the spirit of politics to the spirit of conquest. the policy which stops in good time to the policy which pride pushes towards ruin. But our preference does not extend to carelessness for what remains, and we believe that a limit exists even for carelessness. We have frankly given our opinion on the attitude to be assumed by the Liberal party at the elections, both in the capacity of candidates and voters. Letthem everywhere perform their duty without illusion, in order to obtain here and there a success without presumption.' The SiAde seeks to establish concord in the camp of the Republicans, and thus addresses the Liberal electors "Never was unity more necessary than at the present moment. The question is not to obtain the triumph or certain names over other names supported by Government, but to prove to Europe, to the world, that Democracy is stil living, that it watches over the inheritance of its fathera, and Is determined on defending it by the legal mears open to it. We are quite right in saying that the in.portance of this demonstration will be im- mense. Its result Will not only be to stop our adver. suries In their wild career, but it will also enlighten Goverament, and prove to it that the country seeks the serious development of the principles of 1789, that it desires liberty of conscience and political liberty, that France is sincerely attached to the institutions of equality, and that she does not intend that anoient customs, a hundred times con demned, should in the least degree be substituted for the young and fruitful principles bequeathed us by our fathers. Suoh will be the signification of the Union of Democraoy in the vote of June 20, and it can have no other. We do not seek the triumph of one or another shade of opinion in aparticoula name. We continue to follow the tradition of the alliance between the middle classes and the people, which forms the honour of this journal, and we say to all-vote for the welfare of all; for the triumph of common ideas and interests; vote for 1789; voto for all that has been realized by that grand event, for all that remains to be carried out by its agency. When a noble cause is at stake, rivalries, oenities, all the Ilmber of old political parties, should be cast away. We shall support all legal candidateships which may represent an honourable name, and the shade of politics will not concern us. The policy to which we shall remain faithful is-respect for all opinions, but war at tho poll to all antagonists of liberty." The IudApen&dnt de Owuest contains the following bxief statement of its intentions;-" We had been forbidden to discusg the electoral que3tion, but this prohibition has now been raised. WVe avail ourcelves of the freedom granted us to declare that we sball abstain." It is said that the King of Sardinia is about to form a matrimonial alliance with the Royal house of Saxony. The Princesa Sidonia, now in her 24th year, is spoken of as the future Queen of Sardinia; and the journey of the King of Saxony to Italy is probably connected with that expected event. The KRing of Bavaria lefa Paris at half-past 9 this morning by the Straabourg Railway. The waitingroom was decorated wfith escocheons bearing the Bavarian arms, and clusters of Bavarian and French flags. Baron Hervey and MM. Baigneres, Jayr, and Perdonnet, directors of 'the railway, received His Majesty, and accompanied him to the special train prepared for him. M. Jayr accompanied the King to. Strasburg, together with MM. Hallopeau and ramoninari, officers of the company. M. Courtines, the French engineer who has been employed in the construction of the principal French railways, and who wascommissioned formerly, in conjunction with MY. Garella, to stady the question of cutting through the Isthmus of Panama, has been admitted into the Ruesian service, and appointed one of the principal engineers of the Russian railways. The French navy appears to have rendered 2inportant services on the coast of Algeria during the recent campaign against the Enbyles. Several yesdpsel d of war watched the movementds of the tribe dwelling on the coast. Tweo steamer3, the Cacique and the Gregeois, in a fortnight transported 2,000 tons of munitions and 500 sick or wrounded. The Russian squadron in the Mediterranean hai dispersed in different directions. T!he Poikau baa gone to the Pirseus, the Philoctete to Constantinople, and the Olaff has taken on board the furniture of the Empress-Dowager, to convey it to Cronstadt. Admiral Behrens, with the Wiborg and Caator, will visit Algiers, and then proceed northward. General Count Kiaseleff, the Russian A-nbassador, having obtained leave of absence for two months, has determined to pass that period at one of the wterng-p laces of Germany. During his absence M de Balabine willcarry on the business of the Embassy. The Government has received amcounts from the frontiers of Persia to the 5th of May. At that date Fezlali Khan, the commander of the troops in Farsistan, had quitted Shiraz, his head-quarters, to return to Teheran. The Persian army was about to evacuate the province, and the Government, in consequence of the peace, was about considerably to reduce the effective force of the arny. The last week has been a profitable one for the Paris shopkeepers. The suite of the King of Bavaria, and other foreignern who visit Paris in great numbers, have mlade large purdbases of articles of luxury. The fancy shops, moreover, favoured by the summer weather, have been thronged with customers. The sale of light summer stuffs was last week double that of the corresponding week of last year. Some of the provincial manufacturers profited by the good demand in Paris, having received large orders to supply the place of the stock so disposed of. The accounts from Lyons are Inore encouraging than those received 15 days since. It would appear ihat the demand for manufactured silk articles inwreass in proportion to the Increased price of the raw material. Some silk manufactarers at Lyons find it difficult to execute all the orders received for the new-fashioned expensive articles! for which that city is so celebrated. Some Anerican commission agents havo, notwithstanding the bad accounts from NewYork, given orders for silk goods to be delivered in the United States after the 1st of July, that is, when the new Customs tariff shall come into operation. The accounts from the silkproducing districts are still contradictory. They have, nevertholess, become more cheering for some days past under the infLuence of fine weather. There exists, moreover, a large stock of raw silk at Lyons and other towns in the south, which, it is hoped, will prevent excessive speculation. Letters 1 from Valence state that the weather had been rather rainy, and that the silkworms appeared to feel the influence of the atmosphere. A fresh north wind had subsequently improved the worms, which were languishing and had passed through their third stage, and strong hopes are entertained that the silk crop will amount to a fair average. In the Ardeche considerable losses were sustained after the worms had passed through the third stage-lossea which were, fortunately, repaired after the fourth stage. Fortunately, the mulberry leaves are abundant, 6,000 kilogrammes of cocoons from Calamata were sold at Marsilles last week at 26f. the kilogramme. The accounts froma Naples, Lombardy, and Spain calculate on only two-fifths of an ordinary crop. These accounts form an unpleasant exception to the hopes excited by the appearance of al other crops. It is many years since the weather was so propitious for the frits of the earth, and, consequently, a most abundant harvest is expected of every description of corn, and likewise ani excellent vintage. On this point opinions are unanimous both in France and throughout Earope. It is probable that both wheat and flour, which atill keep up their price, as is usually the caseat the approach of the harvest, will experience a serious fall as soon as the new grain shall arrive at market. The nominal price of flour of the first quality in the-Paris market is 75f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. Hlolders, nevertheless, would will lingly sel at 74f. 50c., and some hundred gacks have been disposed of at 74f. for the end of June. The stock of flour in the Paris market stores is still low. It varies from 7,000 to 7,500 metricd quintals. The favourable appearance of the crops deters the milers from buying wheat at the present prices, except for immediate use, as they expect a very great fall during the months of August and September. This fact explains the comparatively high price of flour and the low stock in the Paris stores. Wheat throughout the departments is generally lower, but there is very little business doiog. The farmers with difficulty abandon the idea they had formed of selling their wheat at a great rise. But as they have as yet a large stock on hand we must expect to see a great quantity of old wheat offered for sale when the new wheat shall make its appearance in the market. The sale of wheat at Marseilles is difficult, since the demand from the interior has ceased. The last accounts from Algeria announce that the farmers are preparing for the harvest, and that we shaU shortly see French colonial wheat in the Paris markets. There has been a fall of 2s. the hundredweight in the sugar-market, but the grocers still keep up the price to 21 and 22 soUs the pound. There is no business doing in the wine-market. The vines promise so well that the buyers look for lower prices, while the holders maintain their pretensions. They pretend that it will require several years of great abundance to supply the void created by the late deficient produce. The price of spirits of wine still declines in Paris. The article is abundant, and there are few buyers. Beetroot spirits are quoted at 120f., and Languedoe 22Sf. the hectolitre.

(FROM OUR BERIN CORR1ESPONDENT,) BERLIN, JuNm 7. As the proposed new tariff is still the moat important topic connected with Russia, I begin to-day by informing your readers that certain advices from St. Petersburg, dated May 26, state positively that the new tariff has been approved and passed by the Imperial Council, and that its publicion may now be expected every day; on the ether hand, lettera from the same place dated the 1st of June state as al proved by the Emperor, for the very reason that the lmperial Council has not yet fiaished its examination of thfi proposed draught. In the absence of any reliable information from any peculiar source of my own, I can only add that, according to all I bear and read on this subject, the least sanguine expectations of the speedy promulgation of a new tariff are the nearest to correctness, at any rate they lead to the smallest amount of disappointment if unfulfiUed. At the same time I masit not omit to mention that the greatest impatience and the liveliest expectation are felt on the subject in St. Petersburg, and the " hope deferred" is causing, a very lamentable suspension of business. Atthedate of thelatest advices (latinst.), the Graud Duke Nicbolashad returnedto St.Petersburg from his tour of inspection made lately thrdugh the fortresses of Poland. The nuptials of the Grand Duke Michael with the Princess of Baden are now fixed to taka place this month. The Grand Duke Constantin.3 was expected back in St. Petersburg to-day, as the christening of the last born Prince was to take place to-morrow at Zavskoe Selo; but, like so many other arrangements connected with the movements of great folks, it will not be possible to keep to it. I mentioned some time back that the name to be given to the youngest scion of the Imperial family, Sergius, is one that has either no precedent in the family annals, or, at any rate, has not been adopted for a long time, andconsequently has excited eome-surprise at the choice. The enigma is at length solved by a letter wvhich the Emperor has written to the Metropolitan of Moscowv, wrhich, as it also affords uts a clear perception of the religious views of the Emperor on the subject of the intercession of saints, I give you in ezten.so: "Reverend Metropolitan of Mfoscowr, PhUlaret,-In September of last year, after the celebration of the holy coronation, I vtsited with my consort the Convent of the Mediator-Sergins At the grave of this mediator and protect3r of Russia, before whose imperishable remains we bent in faith and awe, we, together with the Empress, pronounced the vour that if it pleased God that Her 91ajesty should bo happily and safely delivered of a son he should bear the name of Serglus, in remembrance of and in gratitade to this great worker of miracles. By his inter. cession our prayer hra been duly -heard and our vow falfilled by us. In communicati this to your reverence I beg yout at the sAme timc, in addition to the sa prayer of thanksgiving on this joyful oooasion, toat up a speciat one in my name to (or in the neightbourhood of) the relics of that martyr, to whose protection wae commend our son. "Thus requesting your prayers for myself, my consort, and our children, - " I remain ever your well affectioned, The inhabitants of Moscow seet disposed to exhibit their loyalty on occason of the birth of the Grand Duke Sergius on a very liberal scale; the corporation of merchants has resolved to put ten orphans and children od indigent citizens on the foundation of the school they have established; and, further, to settle a manriage portion of 200 silver roubles each on ten girls who shall have been brought up in that establishment. The citizens in their corporate capacity have resolved to have renovated at their expense the chapel on MountEleon, in New Jerusalem, in which every year prayers are put up for the welfare of the Imperil Family, and further to devote 20,000 silver roubles to paying off the arrears of taxes due by the poorest of the inhabitants; the body of artisans, too, contributes 10,000 silver roubles to the same object, and increases the number of the pupils in the Artisans' Indigent Institution by 14. In St. Petersburg they are going at length to exert themselves to improve the state of the town, and it may eafely be averred that this does not take place until it was amply wanted; as the town is built upon piles rammed into a marshy soil the buildings that have been based on this artificial foundation suffer very niuch from damp rising up the wals. The corporation has resolved on laying down pipes to drain this ground and relieve the inhabitants of the superfluous moisture, which can hardly fail of being as beneficial to the health of the population as to the durability of the buildinas. Count Schuwaloff also has set about getting the lower, or at any rato the better parts of it, to begin with, repaved in a decent manner; 'he has -issued instructions to the owners of houses how they are to have their portions of the pavements laid down, so that they may not in future have to be taken up again after a short time, in consequence of their being impassable, to the great gain of the pavers, the loss of the 'roprietaires, and the detriment of the public. The prikas he has issued on this occasion is abundant in wain ngs to the careless and slothful, and holds out to them that he shall soon inspect the progress made and see if the public, the hodzjatschiki, and police have done their duty. Regulations have been made also for protecting the I public from a number of abuses they were hitherto subjected to on board the steamboats plying in the Bay of Finland; for instance, these boats are to be allowed to take no more passengers than can be a^commodated with six feet square of deck; further, the appointed times of starting are in future to be rigidly adhered to, while formerly the vemsels were liable to be detained an indefinite time waiting for some person of rank who might have announced his intention of availing himself of that conveyance. The same desire to provide for the wellbeing of the travelling public is shown in some new regulations with regard to the luggage on tha Moscow Railway, It is made possible now to insure the packages for a half per cent. ad ualorem, and the minimum amount of indemnification is settled when the goods have not been insured and subsequently lost. A portion of the troops of the Guard is to be employed in the works of the Petersburg-Warsaw line. It has become evident, as had been already foreseen, that in summer, the only season when works of this kind can be carried on, labour is extremely ecarce, inasmuch as at the same moment all the other out-of-door employments of building, agriculture, and navigation resume their activity. The facilities for obtaining paesports and permission to travel abroad that have been introduced of late by the Government seems to have had the desired effect, if we are correct in attributing to the Emperor the desire that an ircreased number of his subJects should have the means of visiting other countries, and appreciating a state of lems thorough pupilage than that in which his own subjects have been brought up. The total num-. ber of passports issued this spring is said to amount to 60,000. If the real number in any way approach this the revenue, at any rate, will not have suffered fronm the reduction of the price of that document to B roubles. Formerly it sometimes amounted to 500. The most numerous class of travellers appears to be young military men. Whoever has rank and pecuniary means applies now for leave of absence to such an extent that it is difficult to provide for the performance of the ordinary routine of service. Though these gentlemtn do not travel officiaUly, it is well known th it their visitine foreign parts is very aureeabVe to the Emperor, and that they have been invited to send in to their superior officers on their return an account of all they have seen on their travels. These reports, while contributing dons - derable stores of information, will at the same time furnish a tolerable criterion of the capacity of each. individual officer. The route appears to be always Germany, Belgium, France, and sometimes Switzer- lane; and hArdinia, but hardly in any case England I or Austria. This, however, does not appear to be I the result of any prohibition or intimation from bigher quarters, but rather the consequence of the political antipathies engendered during and since the late war. SARDi,-A. (FRoM OmR oWiVN OO1UWPoNDMiT.) TURIN, JuNz 5. In its sittings of the last few days the Chamber of Deputies here has got through a great deal of work' with very little discussion. It has disposed of the estimates for the Departments of War, Finance, and Public Works, besides passing severalother bills. The members seem all anxious to haaten business now, seeing that the session has ahreadylasted five months, and every one is glad to escape the suffocating heat of July and August in Turin, besides that most have their own private affairs to look after elsewhere. There are stil two very serious questions to be deliberated on, however, before the Rouse can separate-that of the Mont Cenis tunnel, on which the majority of the commission has already pronounced favourably, and that of the reform of the Excise duty called gabella, which refers indirectly to the dismolution of the municipality of Genoa, for having refused to pay the impost a, - cording toitaproportion allottedby theGovernment; but there seems every probabiity that Parliament wrill be prorogued about the beginning of next month, and, as the present Chsmber has nearly completed its full legad term of offlce (five years), the {'overnment will, it ix said, refer to the feelings of that a general election may be expected in the course of the autumn. Among the bills lately passed there was one for a railway from Arona to Duomo d'Ossola, for the constraction of which a company has already been formed, and another for a railwav in Savoy, from the Swiss froutier along the southern coast of the Lake of Geneva. Another bill was to authorize the National Bank to alter the proportion between the cash in hand and notes in circulation and current accounts, so that when thetwo latter amount togethertoless than 30,000,000 the first need only be equal to a fifth of the sum; - whenthey amount to froga 30.000,000 to60,000,000 the sum in specie must equal one-third of the liabilities; but when the liabilities exceed 60,000,000 the Bank is required to hoid specie in its chest to half the amount. Lastly, there was a bill for esta- blishing two new lines of telegraph, two in th,e idand! of Sardinia, and one from Annecy to Chamounix. Next year, therefore, English ladies and gentlemen seeking a bubble reputation onMont Blanc willhave the means of announcing to their friends at home their departure or their return with the rapidity of thought, and, if the wires are placed in communication with the Egyptian-hall, the Britiah public may profit to the fullest extent by any novelties that may occur in the ascent. It is calculated that there are from 10,000 to 12,000 tourists at Chamounix every year, and that these will ba sufficient to pay the expenses of the telegraph. In reply to a question from the Deputy Asproni, regarding the submarine telegraph, Count Cavour said that the Sardinian Goveimmeit had not thought it neec0sary to pay the interest guaranteed to the shareholders of the submarine telegraph to Sardinia, because it was not yet in connexion both with the terra firm States and Africa, but that the lFrench Government had, on the requisition of the Sardinian Government, granted further facilities to Mr. Brett, who had on his part concluded an agreement with a large mercantile house in England for laying down the cable to the coast of Africa for the sum of 50,0001., and there was every reason to hope the operation would this time be succemsful. Mr. Brett has also asked for the concession of a line from Cagliari to Malta from the English Government, and Count Cavour exprsaed his confidence in its being shortly granted SPAIN. (FROM OUR OwNr couOnRPONrD1.) rA RID, Tuxa 4. The Oorrespondenci Autografa of last night has the following passage "Several ofto-day s papers desnibe as obscure hbat which the CorreJponldncml4 has said concerning the projects of the Government with respect to Cht national debtas yet not arranged. The Correspondencia haa no mision or authorization in this delicate affair, but does not hedtate to declare again that itbolievestobe destitute of all foundation araunour of the isolated recognition of the coupons Imown au those of tbe committee, and that what in its eyes appears poisible, and very probable, is, that'the Government, by means of the solution of the questions and reclamations to which have given rise the arrangement of the debt in 1851, will try to strengthen Spanish credit, opening to its public funds, by means of equitable measures, the markets which have long been closed to them." With so many financial difficulties, the Spanish Government doubtless feels the necessity of doing something to improve its credit, but It is doubtful whether it will venture to present to the Cortes the project of financial arrangement which it very likely contemplates, for it sears the opposition this would arouse. The Bravo Murillo party and the Polacos, who at present leave the Ministry pretty quiet, and even swell its majorities, would be almost certain to attack it on that question; and in the Lower Chamber they might be able to PUt it in a minority. Something, however, will probbly have to be attempted before very long; and the question is just now very mueb talked about. Senor Salamanca wil pay the next instalment of the Mirha loan, due in the third week of this month, but he has been put to great shifts to raise the money, and has had to pledge securities and resort to extreme and onerous measures. For the payment of the last instalment, due in August, even his ingenuity in finding expedients will hardly suffice, unless something be done in the interim to put Spanish paper in better odour on the foreign stock-exchanges. Except when some particularly important discussion occurs I do not consider it necesay to occupy your space by detailed accounts of the sittings of the Cortes, which, although often animated enough, have posseesed, since the first debate in the Senate, but little interest 'for foreigners. Since that debate the Senate has sat little. In the Lower Chamber the proceedings continue to bear a character of considerable personality, and Marshal Narvae2' injunction of oblivion of the past is scantily observed. Half the time passe in what are here called rectifications, and in replies to allusions which deputies consider made to them, and under pretext of answering which they frequently contrive to inflict long speeches on the Assembly. The Ministerial majorities have hitherto been very large, but this is due in a great measure to the abstinence from opposition of large fractions of the Chamber, which, if they chose to combine and to go against the Government, would ran Ministers very hard. Indeed, there are persons who think that these retain their places merely by the toleration of certain important members of the Congress, and especially of Bravo Murillo, who has hitherto adhered 'to the determination he was understood to have come to before the opening of the Cortes, uot to attempt to turn out the present men, but rather to await their faDl from other causes than being left in a minority. It is, however, much easier to make conjectures than to say positively how the Congress would divide in the event of a strong opposition being made to Government by the combined Polacos and Bravo MuriUists. There is a host of new deputies, and it is hard to say how thingswould go. Meanwhile tbe Government does not act asif it felt very confident of its strength in the Lower Chamber. There can be scarcely a doubt that it feels the necessity of maldki some settlement of the debt, and yet it holds of, knowing the measure to be unpopular, and apparently afraid to bring it forward. In the Mexican affair it has certainly suffered itself to be acted upon by the agitation that has been got up since the Cortesmet, although that agitation has not its origin in any strongfeeling of right or of wounded national dignity, but in the intrigues of fraudulent, or at least doubtful, creditars of Mexico, and in the desireto create embarras- ment for the Government, whose fall would probably be the consequence of its allowing itself to be spurred into hostilities with the Mexican Republic. One can hardly imagine a serious and protracted war occurring between two countries so remote from each other, and, financially spealing at least, so unable to carry it on; but even brief and slight hostilities would have the effect of burdening the Spanish treasury, already in a critical position, and of imperilling the Spanish West Indian possessions.
MEI'ROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORRS. An adjourned ordinary mneeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works was held on Monday in the Council-chambar, Guildhal; Mr. J. Thwaites in the chair. PINSBXuRY PARE. The Board this day resumed the consideration of the different clAuses of the Bill prepared by the solicitors of the Board for the formation of a park for Finsbury and the northern suburbs of the metropolis. Clauses 7 to 15 were agreed to after considerable discussion. On clause 16 being read, which proposed that "The expenes incured by the Board In aDoiYing for and ping this ALL and preparatory or incident thereto, and the expense of crrying this Act Into execution, shall he and are hereby included in tbe exeenses which are authorized tobe defrayet by the Boardunder and in the manner 1,rovided by the MetropolsLoca Management Act% Mr. IEsLIE altogether objected to giving the Board power to tax the ratepayers of the metropolis for the purposes of this park. The St. George'a vestry, which he repreeented, and of which Bord Calthorpe was churchwarden-thenobleman who had lately presented a park to the inhabitants of Birmingham free of expense-was strongly opposed to this park being formed at the expense of the ratepayers of the metropolis. Tho real object of this Bill was to enable the p%triotic gentlemen of Islington to got their hpads out of a noose and to slip the necks of the ratepayers of the metropolis in. He opposed any such tax upon the metropolitan ratepayers. Mr. H. L TAYLOIt strongly opposed the clause, and contended that a resolation had been already passed which had not been rescinded, which expressly stated:- That this Board acinoirledge the importance of retaining open spices in the Metropolis, and the permanent advantace wbich woutd ararue totbe ncrtbern suburb by thepreservationxof HaiTpetead-haeeth wsd its appropriation as a place of recreation for the public; but as Of opnl(nttatfmpr,vemenls of much greater nesty end advantage to the gexeral public are more urgent and d embirle. and resolve. therefore, not to entertan the question of tbe purchase of land for the Dnr poe of a park. And, MoreoTer, it is t1e optnhn of thisBoard that the =owem conferred by the Metropolis Looal Managemnent Act do not a ttorize them to tax the ratepayers for such objects.5 That wais the recorded opinion of the Board, and whioh hAd never been rescinded; and, such being the state of things, he beheved that the Board had no power to proceed. with the present question. This question led to a long and irregulhr discussion; the clause was put and agreed to byanajority of 18 to 7. The remuaininig olausee werer all agreed to by alarge mna-.

I MOONYMARKET and CITYIrNTBLLrGE.Yag. Tuesday Ererdng. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mUle premium, and the short exchange on London is 2B.2h per ad i fterliog. H b comparing togeo rates with the shnglish int price of 3 L. U ds. oIO. per ounce for standard gold it appeats that gold is nearly 2-lOthp per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the price of goldais 423j per mark, and the short exchange on London is ISAi per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 1-10th per cent. dearer in Haamburg than in London. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 109k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint proportions between the two countries, shows that the exchange is about at par; and, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves a small profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The funds opened this morning at a recovery of an eighth, and ultimately experienced a further slight; improvement. The first transactions in Consols were 93j to 94 for money, and 94i to i for the acount, and they remained without alteration until near the close, when they went to 94j to I (or 93 to j ex dividend) for the account. The transfer books of Consols and India Stockelosed-today'. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92 to I; New 'Three-per-Cents., 92t to I India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 2s -discount to 2s. pritiun. Il thelStockMExchange loans for short periods on Government securities were obtained with comparative ease, bat for any lengthened term the rate was atill6i per cent. Inthe discount-market and at the Bank the demand was moderate. The transactions in foreign securities have increased, and prices generally are rather firmer. Turkish Si per Cents, for money, were negotiated at 9-1, and for the account at 95. The other operations oroprised-Braziliazi our-and-aHalf per Cents., 97k; Buenos Ayres, for account, 85; Mexican, for money and account, 224 ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 75i; the Threo per Oent4., 53; RusaianFiveper CentL 109i; -panish Three pr Cents., 42 and 41k; the Kew Deferred, 25k; Spanish Certificates, per cent.; Dutch Two-snd-a_alf per Cets., 65 and the Four per Cenrt Certificates, 97i. an the foreign exchanges this afternoon with the exception of Paris, which was a shade lower, no alteration of importance took place. The final quotations of the French Three per Centf. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 6Sc. for money and 67f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing a preponderance of money purchases and an average improvement of a quarter per cent. Afurthersumof aboutl05,0001., outof therecent Australian gold arrivals has been sold to the Bank to-day. Of the 305,0001. brought yesterday by 'che American steamer 125,0001. was on French account, and the remainder has been taken for transmission to the Continent, chiefly for the purchaso of silver. According to some of the letters from Paris the increase of specie at the Bank of France has been checked durmg the last day or two by further large remittances to Tuin. This, however will be counteracted by the amounts transmitted to-day from London. The demand at Paris for bar silver and five-franc pieces for shipment to the East is active, and the efforts of the police to suppress it are, of course, in a great degree futile. The suspension was announced to-day of the bank of Messrs. Gotch and Sons, of Kettering. The firm was an old one, having been established 65 years back, but its liabilities are not supposed to be very large. It was a bank of issue, Rith a circulation limited under the Act of 1844 to 9,1921., and according to the last published returns its total of notes out was8,7921. The bank was in difliculties in 1825, from which it recovered? but for some time lately its position had agan been regarded as doubtful. The commercialadvices from New York to-day describe increasing ease in the money-market, the bank returns continuing to show an augmentation of specie in the face of the large shipments to Erope. This was owing to the payments usually made at this season from dealers in the interior to the importing firms. The smallness of the disbursements for {stoms' duties pending the reduction in the tariff on the Ist of July likewise exercked a favourable influence. Nevertheless, the downward course of the railway-market continued. Erie stock had experienceda further fall of 9 per cent., the last quotation being 33. Since January the decline has been equal to 28 per cent., and, as most of the other large railway stocks take their tone from this, the distrust and depression are general. Reading was quoted 78i, and New York Central 84i. Illinois Central alone is maintained with firmness, and this stands at 38X to 39 premium. The importations of European goods during the past week had amounted only to 545,000., agamst I 827,0001. in the corresponding weekof last year; but the total since January had been 19,100,0001., against 16,757,0001. in 1856. After the preseota month they wil again probably be large, and anticipations are expressed that a renewal of stringency in the money-market may then be experienced. With regard to the harvest there was every prospect that it would be late. Wiater had suddenly [been succeeded by summer at nearly the end of May, and the usual spring sowings had been interfered with. The mania for land speculations, moreover, had caused the farmers to neglect their regular business. Unless great activity is displayed there will therefore be some danger of short crops. It was believed, however, that unusual efforts would be made, especially as, according to some accounts, there has probably not been a sping during tho last 40 yearswhen the stocks in hand were at so low a point. In general budsne there was nothing new, but the tendency was towards dulness. The next steamer to sail was the Arago on the 30th of May, and it was expected she would take 200,0001. chiefly for France. The Mexican dollars brought by the last packet have been disposed of at 61d. per ounce, being an advance of id. upon the price obtained for those by the steamer of last month. At a special meeting of theAustralian Agricultural Company, held to day, the Bill before Parliament for granting additional powers and reducing the number of directors and auditors was brought under consideration. The general principle of the Bil was sanctioned by the whole of the shareholders in attendance, althoughthe proposed modifications occasioned some discussion. It was urged that, as the number of directors, exclusive of the Governor and Deputy Governor, wiU be reduced to six, the power of appointing the Deputy Governor should remain ii the hands of the proprietors, so that it may be possible for them to abolish the office, which carries a fixed e!nolument, if they think fit. The directors and some of the shareholders were opposed to this suggestion but a resolution on the point was oventuallycarriea bya majority of 7. With regard to the developement of the estates and the coal and other mines it was stated that it may be requisite to make grants of lands to individuals constructing rail, tram, or other roads through the property, but a provision in the Bill which in additon gave authority to support by share subscriptions or loans any enterprise of the kind was negatived. The Talavera has arrived from Chins with 233,1001b. of tea and 1,046 bales of silk. Tho Commissioners of Customs have granted to Messrs. Neal and Co. a first-class sufferance for the old-estblished wharf in the Baltic trade, known as Mark Brown's wharf, in Southwark. The amount paid into the. treasury of the East India Company for bills on India from the 25th of May to the 9th of June is 72,3301. The following are from Australian companies:- " POPy PHILLIP AND COLONI&1. "The company have received advices from their reident director, dated Melbourne, April 11.

I VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS. TTm-. 9- I _ PEACOC}, V. SMuRlnR m t.HPorM Vice-ChamWor Sir RL k Tr cr. i ID this case Sarah Power, by her will, dated in 1766, gave to trustees a sum of 3001. South Sea Stock, upon trust, to pay thereout 71. per aunum to the minister of the Baptist chapel of Worplesdon or Worpleton, near Guildford, Surrey, and after his deceasm to pay to his successors and successor for ever. There was alo a gift of 20s. peryear to the minister of the Baptist congregation at Guildford for 20 years with a residuary gift over. These payments were made to Messrs. Haydon, bankers, of Guildford, for some years, but the congregation at Worpleton having dispersed, and the chapel aving been puled down, the 71. per annum had accumulated, and this bill was filed by the repreEentative and next of kin of this testatrix for the payment of the arrears and dividends due to him. Mr. BAiY and Mr. TATLTTT appeared for the plaintiff, and argued that even supposing a new congregation should be assembled and reformed it could not answer the description in the will, which applied to that congregation and no other. The ViCE-CAxcELLoR said that certainly there would be no apostolic succession. Some question then arose as to the fact of there bemg at present no Baptist congregation at Worpleton, but eventually the case went on that assumption, subject to an affidavit being made in respeot to it. Mr. WxcxEs appeared for the Attorney-General, and argued that the gift applied to all time, whenever there was a Baptisat minister at Worpleton at any interval. The VICE-CiEELLOr asked whether it appeared to what division of Baptists the teatatrix belonged, for sbe would turn in her grave if she could know that this gift would go to some other division than the one to which she belonged. Mr. WICExNs eaid it did not appear. When property was given to redeem poor captive slaves in the Barbary States the intention was the same as here, namely, for a particular purpose for ever. The V:iCE CHAxCELLoR said that the great difference be. tween that case and the present was, that in the cae of the Barbary slaves the sum required each year might vary. Mr. WIcNrS said that the failure of the gift here did not create a resulting trust for the next of kin, but that a sum of stock representing the 71. per annum might be purchased and retained, and that a scheme might be considered for some other object, or that the fund might await the time when a Baptist congregation should answer the description in the wifll. Mr. HAwlxs appeared for the trustees. Mr. BALy was heard in reply, The VICE-CHANCLOR thought that it was necessary to place yourself in the position of this testatrix to be enabled to construe her will. It must be assumed that she was a Baptist, and that there was at the date of her will some Dissenting congregaton -aud a minister, a congregation mneaning a body of persons krofessingthose tenets, meeting habitually for public worship. She naturally, therefore, vished that they and their minister-should exit for -a time, but she could not answer for that, and the question was whether she dedicated for the purpose of the charity either a fund or a perpetual annuity of 71. in the shape of a direction to pay that sum de anno in asinum, if there should be persons sustaining those characters, No doubt it was a charity, and whatever fund orproperty was given to a charlt, to the extent of the dedication, if the charity failed, the primary object of the fund was considered as impressed with a cnaritable Intention. The only question vvas, whether she meant to dedicata 71. in every year, whether thera was a minister or congregation or not - or whe. ther whenever there was and as long as there was a congregation and minister 71 should be paid in each year, and nO more paid to the persons susta]ning that character. His Honour thought the latter was the true construc- on. The second gift of 11. per year was the same in substance, one limited for the time being, the other for 20 years. If the congregation had removed to some other place of worship, or had tbere been a split among them, the case 'would have been different. Without in the least, there. fore, trenchingon the authorities on. this point, the $axin. tihffi'wvas edntitled, not only to the income, but the capital of (Before Vlee-ChanceZor Sir W. P. WOOD.) IN THE MATTER OF ARMESTRONG. The VICE-CEANCE,LOR gave judgment in this case which was argued yesterday. The question was in substance whether the ssignee of South Sea Stock was entitled to the umount of bonuses which had been decl-red on the stock since the date of the assignment. The amount had been iAd into court under the Trustee Relief Act, other petitions depending on the deciaion of the case, which was argued on behalf of one of the parties, named Smedley. The assignor, who was entitled to a reversionary interest in the stock, expetant on the death of his mother, who was entitled to a life intereat, had durin her life sold and a6signed to Snedley, the petitioner, a2 hat sum of 2,0001. South Sea Stock, and the dividends thereof, being the portion of 12,0001. to which he was entitled, andl his right, title, and interest, &c - notioe wasgiven to the trustees of the will under which his mother became tenant for lfe. The same questionhad been raised in a case decided by Lord St. Leonard's when Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1848, in a case of " Plunkett v. Mansfield" (2, Jones and Latouche, 345.' It was then decided that a purchxaer of a prtion of stock to which a party was entitled on the death of an annuitant was not entitled to the aCCretions bv way of bonus which had been afterwards declared on the amount of the stock sold, nor to the surplus dividends. If that case were in all respects accurately reported his Honour thought it not distinguish. able from this. As to one part of the case his Lordship had decided differently, observing that one of the par'ties had settled all her property and had assigned her one-fifth of a uarticular sum of Bank Stock, but said nothing of any accretion which might be made to the capital sum nor of the savings which were directed to be invested. Lord St. Ieonard's sard, " the capital of the Bank Stock invested to answer the annuity epresents by intention and by operation of law not only accretion made to it by bonus, but also all the surplus dividends and savings arising from that very stock." He further said he consldered "that the settlement of tha one-fifth of the 7,500l. Bank Stock being the fountain from which every thing flowed inmiuded in it all the accretions thereto," and that " by operation of law the bonus would form part of the capital, though not so directed to be by the deed. "Is Honour said he had the satisfaction of feeling that his Lordship's view so far agreed with his own on that part of the case. But then on another part of the case, relating to another party, who claimed under a specific contract for a particular portion of the fund, described as 7501. Bank Stock, there being a specific price laid for the speCific article, his Lordship drew a distinction between the consideration for a purchase amea sured by value and not by marriage, and held that the pur. chaser did not take the accretions. And upon this part of the case his Lordship said,-" There is some difficulty as to the bonus, for I should hold that if aman sold Bank Stock, and that afterwards and before the transfer a bonus was gven upon that stock, the seller could not claim it - for it is given to the person who Is the owner of the Bauk Stock at the time; it follows the ownership. But this (said his Lordship)is the case of a sale of a particular sum of stock out of a reversionary interest in Banik Stock, and tho purchaser was not entitled to call for a transfer at the time when the bonus was declared. I think that, M the purchaser purehased only 7501, stock, she is not entitled to the bonus. I should bo of a different opinion if this were the case of a person entitled to the entire produce of a fund selling the whole of his ruversionary interest; but as this case stands I think the purchaser is entitled to the 7501. Banktock, and no more." His Honour said he regretted that he could not see in the judgment the grounds for the distinction. It had been put in argument that the real test was this, to consider it as a transfer of a share in a trading trnsaction; the trade might fail, or it might be entirely destroyed, and then who was to bear the loss? The simple way of regarding it was as a contract by the party to trausfer stock, and with it all the party's equities and interests in it. lie did nor consider that the distinction between a consideration for marriage and for money value had much bearing on the question, exoept so far as to enable the Court to see in the case of money that sufficient value had been given. It was with great diffidence he differed from so high an authority as that of loord St. Leonard's, by which, of course, generally he should feel himself bound; but he 'was unable to appreciate the reasons forthe udgment. The party receiving this asi nt was entitled to everything the property or the stockc produced. The case was argued by -Mr. L Russell, Mr. Giffard, Mr. Southgate, Mlr. IIofSin_n, r. Dzewry, and MEr.

COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, WZSTM]NSTI, JTum 9. THE QUEEN V. THE SHBEWSBURY AND HEREI'ORD RAIL. - - - WAY COMPANY. yKVngs5 tn Uanco, beforc Lord CA14PBELL an2d Juquke" COLERIDGE, ERLE. and CROmPTOniA an z=s case sle Uowrt had granted a rule calling U the Sbrewsburyand Hereford Rai1way Colpany to sio cause why a mandamus bhould not issue commanding them to proceed under the 96th ection of the Landg-Cluseu Consobdation Act to enfranchise certain lands in the manor of Stretton-in-the-Dale, in the county of Sdo, and to aseer. tan the amonnt to be paid- to the Lady of the Manor as compensation for her manorW iaghts. Mr. SCO ND, on the part of the compony, now showed cause against the rule, and contended tbat, according to the facts as now brought before the Court in the affdavit made by Mr. Peele, the solicitor to the company, there hd been no smch demand and refumal as was neceEsary to found an application to this Court for thewritof ncdamrn. It was also the duty of the prosecutrix to send in her claim for compensation isn respect ef hereditanmenbs, fines1, &o, all of which matterflay peculiarly writhin the knowrledge of the lady of the Mfanor and hersteward. It was only in case the parties could not come to an agreemlent as to the amount of comnensation to be paid that it was provided the amount shoud be ascertained by arbitration or by a jury. Mr. Ssru YTe was heard at some length in support of the rule. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged, and that the application was ground. less and vexatious. The Lady of the Manor was entitled to bave the copyhold enfranchised, and the comDany was bound to pay her compensation for the loss of her manorial rights. But the company had always been ready to do so. The mandamgs was in effect to summon a jury, but it was not shown that the company was in de.ault and had refused. It lay on the Lady of the Manor to give reasonable evidence to the company of what she demanded; bat by her solicitor {she had refused to give information either as to the area or the rights in respect of which she claimed compensation. Of those matters the company could have no information and they lay exalusively in the knowledge of the Lady of the Manor and her steward. HisiLordship then referred to the correspondence between Mr. Wodehotie and Mr, Peele the solicitor to the company, 'and said that the letter of the latter was fair and reasonable, and that all went smoothly till Msr. Wodehouse quarrelled abont a fee, and from that time lost his temper, and sought to Iick a quarrel with the company. The suppression of Mr. Peele's letter of the 17th of April his Lordship thought was not ingenuous. Upon the whole, his Lordship thought the rule ought to bo discharged, with costs. Mr. Justioe COLERIDGE said he had not information enough to say whether or not the application was vexatious. Hr. Wodehouse had not stated his case very clearly to the Court, but his Lordship rather thought he had acted bond ,Wde. The rule, however, must be discharged, and perhaps with costs. Mr. Justice EnLE and Mr. Justice CRomtp'roN were of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged, and with costs. There was nothing like a refusal b,y the oompany to do a duty imposed upon them, and it was only on a clear refusalto do such a duty that this Court would grant a sandam7usn Rule discharged, with costs. TREHEISE V. GARbc!lM This was an action in which the plaintiff sued the Lord of the Manor of Cheltenham to recover back certain fees vhich he had been required to pay on admisdon to certain copyhold tenements. A special case was subsequently stated which laised ax questions for the opinion of the Court, who ultimately gave judgnent in favour of the plaintiff. In effect, the Court decided that the defendant was entitled to certain fees,- but lower than he had comgelled the plaintiff-to pay, the precise amount to bo settled y theMaster, npon a qwatusm meruit. The declantion contained only the general count for money had and received, to which the defendant had pleaded the general issue. On the taxation of costs the Master had allowed the defendant certain costs, and the question now raised upon a rule for the Master to review his taxation was, whether the Master had properly allowed those costs to the defendant. Sir F. XEr:ry and Mr. PHIPSOx showed cause against the rule, and contendedthat, as the plaintiff was proceeding for several causes of action, the count and plea were divisible, and the costs had been properly taxed. Mr. J. WIzDE, Q.O., in sapport of the rule, soda the action was brought to try, =t, whether the defendant was entitled to take any fee- and, secondly, whether it was a customary fee. The &our. had decided that the defendant was entitled to take a fee, but not a customy fee, but only on a quczulum meruit; and, aecordingly, the plaintif7ras entitled to recover, thongh not to the amaount claimed. The plaintiff had not failed to recover; he had only failed to establish one of the grounds on which he rested his claim.

XrnUu movea ror a rute calling on the above railway company to show cause why a railway belonging to the Eastern Union Railway Company should not be as fairly and efficiently worked and kept up between Norwich and London as the same was worked and kept up before and at the time of the passing of a prlvate ActbParliament relhting to the oompany-the 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 120. It appeared that there were two routes from London to lNorw one by Coklhder and Ipswich, and the other by Ely nd Brndon. The riUway fromBmndon to Norwich belongs to the Norfolk 3Railway Company ; that fromColchester vid Ipswich to Norwiah blonip to the Eastern Union Railway Company. The formerihas a station at a place called Thorpe, which is at a considerable distance from Norwich, and very inoonvenient: the latter has a station caUed the Victoria sttion, which is mach more con! venientlysituatod as regrds Norwich. At thetime of the g of the private Act referred to it was opposed by the =rwich people, who procured the insertion of a clause for the purpose of keeping up the traffic by the Ipswich route but since the passng of that Act a nuamber of trains have been discontinued and at present there are only two by the wich route-one express and the other Parliamentary. Tne object of the rule was to compel the company to run these triDns more fairly and efficiently. Mr. Jutice CREss*wxu said it would probably turn out to be only a local squabble. Rule niai granted.

Eule granted. NxW TRIer PAPER COLLETT V. FOSTR This was an action of trespass for fase imprisonment, aud at the trial before Mr. Baron Martin at the sittings in Middlesex it appeared that the imprisonment in question took place under an iUegal writ which had been issued against the defendant by the attorney of the plaintiff who had authorized him to take certain proceedings against the defendant. The questions at the trial were whether the defendant, not having been proved to have expresly authorized the step out of which the action arose, was liable to the plin or, or, if not, whether she did not ratify the act of the attorney bya certain letter so as to adopt it. The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 501. damages, this rule for a new trial was afterwards obtailned, on the grounds that the judge had misdirected the jury as to the liabity of the defendant, and that the verdict was excessive. Qfr. Serjeant SErB and Mr. U.N-THAws appeared to show cause against the rule, contending that the client was liable by implication of law for the acts of the attorney in a suit authorized by him, but that at aU events the defendant had ratified the act of her attorney im the present casem Mr. HAWENS having been heard on the other side, The COURT gave judgment, discharging the rule on the firTt point, but making it absolute on the second, unless the defendant would consent to reduce- the damaaes to 301. The Chief Baron ana Barons Marin and Watson entertained no doubt as to the liability of the defendant as the client for the acts of her attorney; but Hr. Baron Bramwell,while agreeing in the judgment on the ground of ratification, took occasion to express his doubts whether the defendant could be made liable for the illegal act of her attorney, simply beuse he so acted in her name while engaged in the conduct of a suit on her behalf. Mlr. Serjeant SEE accepted the sum proposed by the Court in reduction of the damages awarded by the jury, The rule was discharged generaUy. ABBOIT V. FESRY. This was a rule for a new trial in an action on an accentance for 350., in which a verdict passed for the plaintiff, on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was not warranted by the evidence. At the trial, before the Chief Baron, it appeared that the defendant, who was a farmer and landowner in Huntingdonshire, had been extensively enRaged in biU transactions and money dealings with cue Jon Thang Harradine, and that in many instanoes the latter had taken the liberty of fcrging the defendanfs name both to bills of exchange, as aeceptor and endorser, and to checks on his bankers. Some of these forged bills had been reneswed or taken up by Haradine, with the knowledge of the defendant, and the forged checks were met by payments in to the bankers', mada by Harradine, to the knowledge of the defendant. It also appeared that shortly before the brll on which the action was brought, and which was assumed to;ave been forged by Haradine, the plaintiff, being the holder of another forged bill for 300W, purporting to have been accepted by the defendant, wrote to the defendant on the subject, and that that biU was taken up at maturity by Harradine though no notice was taken of the plaintiffs letter by the defendant. It further appeared that the defendant had dealt with Harradine after these forgeries had become known to him and up to the very moment of his absconding. Under these circumstances, The CMxF BARoN left it to the jury to say whether the bill in question was accepted in the nxme of the defendant in a manner accredited by his conduct, and whetherhe had byhisoconduct given credit to the forgeries of Hardine, as in those events he was liable on the present The jury foud for the plWntlft.

It appeared that the defendant was the landlord of a person named David Davis, who lived in the neig~hbourhood of the Gray's-inn-road, andl that in February nthe Put an execution into Davis'sl house for arrears of rent. The plaintiffs, Mr. R1. Evans and the Itev. J.

On the 4th of March Davis's goods were removed to Messrs. Buolloks auction-roonis, in IHigh Holborn,. and on the sameo day the plaintiffs' attorney gave the defendant notice of the hill of sale held by thema, and ,requested him to hand over all moneys that he might recive above the amount for which they were levied, or any goodsa 'Which mnight remain in his hands when his claim had been 1l'qnidated, in satisfaction of that hill of sale.

The valtte of those goods was about 3101., and the defe',dAnt also reeeived t'hesum of 17s. from theauctioneer above the amount of rent due, but he p aid over the 17's. and returned the goods to Davis, who had sold a part and kept the rest of them.

On reaching the house he found the prisoner sitting on the sede of a bed in a baek room, and on telling hima what his daughter had told hiMM, he replied that it ws quite true, and thae the poison he had taken was oxalic acid. On inquring for the epvelope of the poison. he pointed to the freplac%, where Witness found a piece of pcr with oxalic aoid sti sticking to it. The prisoner did not con~iplain of paie *or 'sickness, but he wad very white and trembled edoemsively, anl witness thereforo sent another ofricer for medie aslistanoe to counteract the effects of what he had taken. He then said that some wordsi had curred between lhAself and a, woma in tho house, who had charged him, with beting his obcil4 in the mornin7 which he had done for stoppi; toong un e butt he said nothig.I about givin,thecid osn h surgeon soon after attended, and an andote havi been administered, the prisoner was byhis directions ten t onoe to the London Hospital. Elizabeth V>, a young married woman, sAted that she lived in the samestreet as the prisoner, who had employed her, since the death of his wife, to look after the houw and his two children. He had reoently paid her attentions of a very improper descripion, and one dav last week ex- pree his deL... ;r tion to make away with himself and is children, unless she would consent to desert her hns4 band and live with him, which she decisively refued to do. On Saturdy morning she was afraid to get up, a she knew he had poison about kim, but shortly after did so, and saw the prisoner strike the little girl so severely with a strap that she was obliged to interfere for her protection. Witness then went downstairs, baht hearing the child crying out to her, she ran, back again, and found the prisoner with the girl, who told her her father was going to dvo her poison. She asked him what he was about, to rhic e repled, "Nothing," but at the imme time thrust something into his mouth andwaswhod it down with water. She then tried to snatch tho other eid from the bed, b'at Was revented by theprisoner, onw ich she des ptched the daugfitei for a oonstable and gave the prisoner into custody. He was not a man who was given to drink, nor was he the worse for drink upon this occasion, and her belief was that his attempt upon his own life and that of the child solely arose from her rejecting his overtures. Janet Fogg, the prisoner's daughter, stated that while in the room with her father on Saturday morning he told her he wishedto give her something he had in his pocket, and whichhe was going to take also himself. He then got some water ia a teacup, and was about to mix up white powder ia it, but, as her aunt {the second witness) had previously told her she had seen poison in his possession on Friday night, she became alarmed and ran out of the room. Aniarried woman named Fry stated that she called at the prisoner's house on Friday to see Mlri. Vyse, and on asking for her was told by him that she had gone oat to seek fresh apartments, but he added that be was resolved to put an end to his life rather than part with her, and at the same time shiowied hter a packet, as an indication of the earnestness of Mr. Burch, resident surgeon of the london Hospital, deposed to the prisoner being brought there suffering from the effects of oxailo acid, but not so severely as misht have been, ian consequence of a powerful antidote having been judi. ciously gxven him before he was brought there. He could not, consequently, determine what quantity he might have taken. The contents of the paper shown to him were evidently oxalic acid. The constable said Dr. Barchell, of the Kingsland-road, d administered the antidote, and that its effect was imme- The prisoner acknowledged taking the oxalic acid, with'intet to destroy himself, hba4he hadno;design upon the chiild. He had certainly beaten her, bat they werer only a fewratri pos with a strap, for stopping a long time before lighting the The child, however, declared that her father beat her so severely that she nearly fainted, and Mrs. Vyae deposed to seeing the marks upon her after she had been so beaten. A repectable-looking man, who described himself as the prisonerabrother, here stood forward and expressed his conviction that the loss of his wife, the care of his children and other matters had so preyed upon the prisoner's mind as to somewhat weaken his lnteUect. The prisoner, who burst into tears on the mention of his wife'sdeath, waz ordered to be committed for the comple. tion of the medical eviden6e. Bo~HWAnR4toger Grogan, a tall, nrfflauly-lookin Irishman, was charged with committing a violent assault on Jane Counsell, with intent to rob her.

She here exhibited the clothes she had on at the timej,which were torn, especally near the pocket-hole. The husband of lat witness said that they had been to market and were etarning home, but just before he arrived in the Grange-road he met a friend, with whom ha stood conversiz afew minutes; his wife went on before, snd suddenly he heard a scream proceed from the direction of his house.

" The American sohooner Silverkey, with hydraulic apparatus for raising the sunken ships of war in the harbour of Sebsatopol, arrived at Malta from Boston on the 26th, and left for her destination onthe folowing day. "The Colombo, Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam-packet, arrived from Southampton and Gibraltar on the 28th of May, bringgin from Malta Captain Forbes, Lieutenants Costeer and Moore, and Lord W.

A military review and sham fight on a somewhat extensive scale took place on Saturday on Arthur's Seat, aear Edinburgh, the troops being two companies of Royal Artillery, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Crofton and Dfajor Craufurd; the 5th Dragoon Guards, under Lieutenant-Colonel M'Mahon; and the 34th Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel KeUy. The reviewing General wae Viscount Melville, commanding the forces in North Britain. The troops were put through a series of operations. The 'weather being very beautiful, the spectacle attracted an assemblage of about 20,000 persons. at the close the troops passed in review before the General, who expressed his high satisfaction with the manner in which they had conducted themselves. Owing to the large number of invalid troops who have recently arrived at the invalid depOt, St. Mary's, Chatham, from India, it has been found necessary to remove the depOts of the 81st Regiment and the 93d Highlanders, now guartered at St. Mary'; to Brompton barraeks. Yesterday the whole of the officers and men of the Royal Mfarine Light Infantry at present at head-quarters, Chatham, were assembled inthe barrack-square, and, headed by Lieutenant-Colonel R. J. M'Killop, marched to the lines, where the battaUon went through the evolutions and manceuvres of a field-day. The non-commisioned officers and men of the following depots belonging to the Provisional Battalion, Chatham, have completed a course of instruction in the Enf(ield rile previolsly to embarking for India,-viz., 24th, 27th (Ennisillens), 29th, and 32d Regiments. The United States' screw corvette Niagara, 12, Captain Hudson, has been an object of much interest since anchoring at Portsmouth, and has been inspected by numbers of critical professional and amateur naval architects, and naval men of aU ranks. They agree upon one point-the vessel's ugliness. Admiral Sir George Seymour and staff visited her on Sunday, and on Monday evening entertained Captain Hudson, First-Lieutenant Wells, and two other lieutenants, and Chevalier Pappalardo, the United States'Vice. Consul, at the Admiralty-house. The alterations of the Niagara will be effected in the harbour, and not in 'the basin or dock. A large body of dockyard artificers have been put upon -her to expedite the work of cutting away the stancheons and clearing space below to make the required room for coiling away uninterruptedly her propor tion of the great Atlantic telegraph cable. The men are to work from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. The Adelaide, steam transport, Captain Bourne, arrived at Spithead yesterday morning, four and a-half days only from Gibraltar, having on board the 96th Regiment, consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel E.

T}}E BISHOP OF EXETER.-We stated in The Times a short time ago that the churchwardens of St. Olave, Exeter, had made a presentment to the Bishoo of Exeter respecting a little book called the Hymnal iwf ted, which the Rev. R. Roper, the rector of the parish, had introduced into the service of the church, and which the churchwardens alleged to have a Popish tendency. Oa Saturday the Bishop of Exeter cited the Rev. R. Roper and the churchvvardens, Messrs. Estcott and Husband, to appear before hiao at the Palace, Exeter. The Hymnal AVoted was introduced, and the Bishop read several passages from it, dwe]lling particularly on the following, as being most objectionable in sentiment:- *Faithful crs! above all other '.

IRELAND. (FROM OUR OWN CORPUEFP'ON1ET. DUBLIN, MONDAY XOnNnE. THE OATHS BILL. The Norlher-m Whig, at all times and seasors the able and zeaous advocate of Liberalism in the broadest aense, has aome severe remarks upon the meeting of Roman Catholic peers and members of Parliament recently held in London, and upon the recommendation of certain Ixish journasil that op position should be given to the Jew Bill iunless the Roman Catholic grievances be redressed. " We hope, for their own sakes," says the Wig,qS- " The Roman Catholia members will be guilty of no such treachery to the great prindiple of civil and religions liberty. They would cover themlselves with deserved infamy by pursuing such a course. They who were only, as it were, but the other day freed from the shaokles which bigotry and intolerancs had imposed upou them, and who spoent a century olanconring for the sacrcd rights of conscience, to appear now as the abettors of religions disabilities, and the foes of freedom ! We cannot believe that they would be guilty of such 'dagrant inconsistency, such scandalouxs selfishness, such unmeasured turpitude. Because they may have grounds Jfor complaint, are they therefore to refuse their COnEent to any relief for their fellowsubjects whlose case is lOtimes worse than their own!u Roman Catholics are told by one of their woulld-be leaders that 'iii nting on this policy they would have the assurauce that they were not obstructing any great mueasure of justice, this Jew Bill being merely a put question, which private friendship has led one or two statesmen to identify themselves with, and it not being pretended, if Baron Rothschild wero kcept out of Parliament for ever, that the public deliberations would suffer very muach thereboy.' This is pretty language to come from the mouth of a frothy spouter about Romcn Catholic wrongs, yelling for their redress. 'Not obstructing any great measure of justice' by opposingthe Oaths Bill! Is not the right of the Jevwto aseat iutheLe1s lature just as cod as the right of the Roman Catholic orthe P?rotestant 9 If it were utnjust to ex cludethe Roman Catholic from Parliament, is it not equally njust to exclude the Jew . Is not the principle the same in both cases! 7And has not the Jew Bill all along been advocated simply as ' a gteat moasure of justice ?' The argument, that because Baron ~thschlld might not possess commanding senatorial ability it iS therefore perfectly legitimate for the Roman Catholic members to combine to oppress and wrong himx, is worthy of a man who could bo so false and traitorous to the great picpetovhich he owes it that he enjoys a seat in Parsimn.But we would warn persons of this class not to push into prominence such an argnment. Tested by it, we would ask how would the PRoman CSatholics themselves far.? Excluding the late MIr. O'Connell and the late Mr. Sheil, what men of first-rate ability have they retutrned since the doors of Parliament were opened to them ? We shall not press the question by going through a catalogue of names, lfor the whole Irish representation sinceo the UJnion is a painful subject. But we have thought it right when this kind of argunent was thrown out to show what was its worth, and what the consequences of its recognition might possibly lead to." LIPTNACY OF TIPPERARY.

The lease of the mines is held from Lord Bangor, of Castleward, at a royalty of one-fifteenth. Three town. ands ared omprised in it; in-whieh several mineral lodes have been discovered producing lead ores, and it is believed that others also exist fuly as productive re tose which have been partialy worked The mine was diseovered by a party of labourers accidentaly turnh g up large masses af lead ores with the seaweed, This induced a. search for mineral veins, which soon proved successful.

The rain, which set in in Dublin on Sunday, appears to have commenced generally a day earlier in the provinces. All the country papers speak of the beneficial effects of the change, and the green crops and meadowving never at any similar period of the season gave promise of grester abundace. T.e Cor1c .porteAT, of yesterday, says:- " Since we last wrote a great chauge for the better has taken place in the weather;* the cold harsh rain which fell in such quantity has been succeeded by a genial summer warmth that promises to realise all that has been prophesied by a ceiebrated French astronomer as to the effects the coming comet is to have for good-namely, doubling the products of the earth this season; and certainly we have never seen a bettor prospect of it than in the present appearance of the crops of al kinds in this district, On Saturday last our market was plentifully szpplied with neat potatoes, which sold readily for Cd. per lb.

It WaY an action by the official manager of the Newcastle Bannk aga&inst Mr. Vincent Scully, to recover 2o,0001., the amount of a judgment obtained against the official manager of the 'l'ipperary Bank. The defendant pleaded that he was not liable, not being a member or contributor of the bankyo faying made a transfer of his shares. In reply, the plaintiff pleaded that the transfer was fraudulent, as certain conditions required by the Bankers' Act were not complied with; and several facts were set out in the replication to show that the transfer was eecret, and that dividends were subsequently received by Mr. Scully. The plaintiff demurred to the replication on the ground of duplicity and embarrassment, and contended that some of the averments should be struck out. After a protracted argument, co-nsel on bothl sides agreed to have an issue raised upon two of the pleaa as to whether the transfer was covinous and fraudulent, and upon another plea, as to whether Mr. Scully was a member of the bank. A similar arrangement was come to in an action to the same effect against Mr. T. Hlone. An application was also made on the part of Mr. Hone; and acceded to by the Court, to allow.him to file two additional pleas in action against him on the same grounds, and to let his case abide the decision ~,of the Court upon the demurrer taken by the plaintiff in the action against Mr. Scully, 'with a view to determntie the legal questions.

THE PARLIAMENTARY OATHS BILL. In conformity with the aanouncenment w^h zppeared in the Tadiet and WCee)dY legister last week, a deputation, comprising Catholic noblemen, members of Parliament, and other influential gentlemen, waited on Lord Palmerston on Monday at his private reddence, Cambridge-bouse, Piccadilly, for the parpose .of urging on 'his Lordship the propriety of including Catholics in the relief from t'he objectionale passages in the oaths now taken by members of the .Legislature.. The depuataion was introduced by his Grace the Duke of Norfolk, and among thosa present were-the Earl of Fingall, the Earl of Kenmare, Viscount Campden, Lord Petre, Lord Stafford, Lord Vaux of lHarrowden, Lord Camoys, Lord Edward Howard, Viscount Castlerosse, tho Eight Hon. W. Monsell, M.P., the Ron. Charles Iangdale, the lon. the Master of Lovat, the Hon. J. F. Arundell, the Hon. G. Mostyn, the Hon.

Blount, Mr. J. Middleton, Mnr. 3 J. Lynch. Mr. J. Blundell, Mr. Berrington, Mr. Scott Murray, Mr. Woodward, and Mr. Silverto A meeting was held f ubaequently at the Stafford-;treet Club, Piccadilly, his Grnoe the Duke of Norfolk in the chair, for "1 the purpose of adopting such steps as might be deemed expedient in reference to the result of the interview -with the Premier." All the members composing the depu tation were present, with the exoeption of Sir T. Burke and the Right Ron. W. MonselL The following gentlemen also attended the meeting:-The Hon. T. Stonor, Sir F. Smythe, Sir PL Gerard, Sir T. Button, Mr. S. De Veze, L P., Mr. C. Larimaudaye (44th Regiment), Mr. BP H. Pollen, Mr. 3. H. Pollen, Mr. E. Deane, Mr. Tempest, Mr. IL Doyle. Mr. H. Bedingfield, Mr. Pugin, Mr. R. German, Mr, T. W. RiddeiL Mr. H. Doyle, Mr. J. Joyes, Mr. J. Doyle. Mr. Sills, Mr. B. Walford, and many others. His Grace the Duke of NoxRoLI, in opening the proceedings, said that, as some gentlemen present had not attended the deputation to Lord Ealmermton that day, he would state to them what had taken plae. He bad laid before his Lordship the objections which the Catholic body entertained to being excluded from the operation of bis Lordship's Bill. In replyto his statement Lord Palmerston said that he himself did not care to exclude Catholics but that he thought including them in the Bill would have the effect of endangEring its adoption. He also considezed that there was nothing in the oath at present required of Catholic members which the strictest of that communion could not subscribe to without any compromise of his religious principles. He (Lord Palmerston) was then asked whether he would support the amendment of which notice had been given,and though he promised that he would give it his consideration he would not pledge himself, assigning as a reason that tbere were Scotch members, Dissenters and otbers, who might be opposed to it, and who, If it were pressed. might be induoed to vote against the measure. The Hon. C. LA?GDALz in movnug the first resolution, said that he had to apologize for tading the initiative, not being a member of Parliament, but as he took an active part in their last meeting, perhaps he might be excused for making a few observations on the present occasion, in the course of which he would state what cournse he deemed it advisable to adopt. He did not for an instant meanto dictate to bon. members the course which they should pursue in Parlinwent, and his only object was to explain his own opinions. The noble chairman had stated in a few words the result of their interview with Lord Palmerston, and he believed no one was so sanguine as to expect any other reply from the noble lord, whoso statement that he would even give the amendment his consideration was a source of surprse. The first question which they had to discuss was the character of the noble lord's BUI. Many of its parts were insulting to the Catholics, and others were an act of injustice to their body. Won,ii Lordl Palmerston have attempted to act towvards any body of Dissenters in the way that he had done towards them ? Certainly not, aud he would not have dared to offer to even the most insignilicant section of Dissenters the insult that he had inflicted on that large and intelligent portion of Her Majesty's subjects, the Catholics of the united kingdom. (Cheers) By the noble lord's reply that morning it would appear that the only point they were to consider, in his opinion, was the question as to whether or not the Bill would be endangered, but he thought that they had a far more extensive subject to which they should direct their attention. He was an aa*ocate for civil and religious liberty, and would not say anything to the prejudice of the Jews, but they (the Cathoics) were not to be made the stepping-stone to their advancement by not offering any opposition to the continuance of the obnoxious oath, as far as they (the Catholics) were concerned, merely to forward the claims of their Jewish fellow-subjects. (Hear, hear.) He for one would never consent to such a course of action, which he regarded as derogatory to the position they were entitled to assnme. In the first place, they had a duty to discharge to themselves, and they were at the present time called upon to take a step which they were not required to do previously. When they wore emancipated they wer no parties to that form of oath which the Legislature prescribed. They were not .consulted en the subject, Xfe belecved that all that was done in endeavouring to ascertain their sentimentsvwas to refer to some bishops, whostated their conviction that Catholics might conscientiously take that form of oath. There was nothing to prevent them, under the circumstances, from endeavouring to free themselves from the imposition of an oath which he contended they must feel to be insulting to their well-known sentiments of loyalty. He thought they should consider those who were to follow them, and he had the strongest objections to imposing on the Catholic body in future an oath to which they might conscientiously object. When he used the term "conscientiously" he did not mean to say that he himself could not take the oath, because he had done so, but it contained so much that was objectionable that he would not consent to imposing it on others, and he could not see how be could act otherwise were he a member of Parliament than give this BiU his most strenuous opposition. (Chears.) Lord Palmerston said, "If you allow this Bill to proceed it will be a step in advance, and your turn willcome next." (Laughter). He believed that the very reverse would be the case, and if they permitted themselves to be singled out of the whole community, and to be marked by the imposition of a peculiar oath, so far froni promoting their cause, all their prospects of success for the future would be seriously damaged. It was only by acting with other parties that they could hope for success. He asked them again, did they believe that Lord Palmerston would dare to act towards Wesleyans, Caivinists, or any other sect of Dissenters in the way thit he had done towards the Catholics ? No, for if hekhad attempted to .do so in reference even to any body of Dissenters,such as Wesleyans or Unitarians, though not one-twentieth in number of the Catholic body, he would be pursuing a course that would bo dangerous to his position in Parliament. He believed there was an impression among some politicians that Catholics might be legislated for excyptionay to any extent. As the deputation had proved unsatisfactory, he trusted Catholic members would exert themselves to defeat the measure. He concluded by moving a resolution to the effect that, Lord Palmerston's explanation being unsatisfactory, an amendment should be proposed in committee on the Bill. Mr. MOORS, M.P.. said that an amendment was already on the books of the House, introduced by an able ii?ember, Mr. Deasy, and hethought the bestcourse would be to pledge themselves to support that hon. member, or to introduce an amendment embodying the views expressed by the noble cbairman at the deputation that day. Lord CAaovs objected to the meeting pledging them. selves to the resolution. The Earl of KREhArtx asked whether it was Intended that the resolution should be binding on members of the Legislature? Mr. EsmiONDE said that if a member did not express his dissent from any resolution of the meeting it would, of course, be taken for granted that it had his assent, and that he would act on it. Lord VAux said the resolution was so far binding that it was an expression of opinion on the part of the gentlemen present. Mr. MAGouTn, M.P., said hecould zot seewhylon. gentlemen experienoed any difficulty with respect to the matter, as they were giving utterance to an opinion, and every gentleman who agreed with that resolution was bound by it. Indeed, they would be stultifying themselves if they did not adopt it. The really important question was not whetherthey were to agree to that resolution, but what course they were to adopt if Lord Palmerston did not act properly towards them. There could be no doubt that Liberal members would vote for Mr. Deasy's amendment, but be would repeat that the question they were called on to consider was the course of action they were to take, what means for giving effcot to their views were to be adopted, and what was to be their final course. He contended that their mode of procedure was clear. If Lord Palmeraton treated the Catholic cause with derision, endeavoured to make, it farcical, and did not go into the lobby with them on a division, what ought they to do? If, on the other haud, he acted honestly in respect to Mr. Deasy's amendment, then they were bound to give him every consideration. But if ho treated them improperly be (Mbr. hlaguire) thought they were bound too oppose him. He was readg to strain a point to secure the admission of the 3ewvs into Parliament, as an advocate of civil and religious liberty. Att the same time he thought that Catholics had nothing to thauk the Jews for, as he remembered eome 7ears ago, when there was what was termedPapa,l aggression in this country, that the most indignant traducers were tobe found amongthe Jews, who, though oppressed themselves, turned round upon another oppressed section of the community, and endeavoured, because they considered them helpless, to crush them. As far as his personal feeling was concerned, he would be happy of an opportunity to show them that ha did not forget their conduct at the period to which he allnded. They owed something to their own religion and to themselves, and they certainly shonld not be made scapegoats onthe present occaion by permittiog their limbs to be fettered at the time they were assistimg in securing freedom for others. He merely shadowed forth his opinions, not having come prepared to address the meeting, and he would only add, in conclusion, that if Lord Palmerston did not act towards them with good faith he thought there ought to be an end to the Jew Bill for that session. Mr. WALLIs said he had hoped that some gentleman present would propose a resolution pledging the meeting as to the course of conduct which members of both Houses of Parliament should pursue in case protection to their honour and their interests should be refused. He thought they should take a further step, and that they should adopt means for enabling the Catholic body at large te express their opinion both in Ireland and in this country. Theyhad the doputation to Lord P&nmerston, and the matter would pas into the hands of members of Parliament without the Catholics generilly being able to give utteranoe to their sentiments on this important subject. He would suggest that they should draw up a declaration to bo signed extensively and presented in the forn of a petition to Parliament. Some difference which existed among their bodv might be evoked, but he believed the feeling was overwbeiminglyi n one direction, and that those who dissented would be found to be few, would be well known to tho Catholic and to the general public not of the Catholic body as not being the exponents of Catholic f6eling, or at any time the advocates of Catholic interes (Cheer.) Ho would move,- ,,Tbat a declaratilon be agred to, e2nodpn a resolution to the effect that the Catbollcsrould not be satiste, with their oah bentg ztained Init Prentfostn. nor untl they were laced In thebame podtion as the rest of Her Majesty's eubjetst." hr. MOORE said he fully concurred in vwhat had fallen from Mr. Langddle, Mr. Maguire, and Mr. Walls, but at the same time he conidered the resolutions now proposed for their adoption were premature. It Lord Palineton *acted towards them in a bond j.ie spirit he really did think that they should support his Bill, even if the amendment were defeated. Hethought that, tuder all the circumstancee, it would be nost unadvisable to adopt a hypothetical resolution, because their future support or opposition to the Bill would be regulated by LorT mdlerston s conduct. He would unggest that the dy after Mr. Dessy's amendment was de,ided an adjoutned meeting should be held, at which they should determine withont further delay the course they were to pursue, but he did not consider that hon. gentlemen should pledge themselves to any particular resolution at the present moment. Lord CAmOYs agreed with thous gentlemen who considered that it would be better if they did not pledge themselves to any particuahr resolution. He would not pledge himself to OppOse the Bill, even if the amerdment werce reJectnd. MIr. H~GIJIRE said that ho did not sugest opposition to the Bill unless Lord Palmerston acted falsely towards Mr. HRlTcmINs did not entirely concur in what had fallen from Mr. Moore, and would second the resolution of Mr. Wallis. He thought that the doclaration should be drawn up in favour of hr. Deasy's amendment and presented to the House. Mr. RYLEY said he entirel concurred In the spirit of Mr. WalliWs resoltion, but he would say he did not consider that it exactly met the circumstances of the case or went far enough. First of all, who was .to draw up the petition1-for there were no persons ap Dinted with executive functions to take the initiative. He would take the liberty of moving a resolution which, in his judgment, would suit their purpose better than the motions thea before them, as it would afford greater latitude with reference to their future proceeding. The present meeting was composed of heterogeneous materials. There were members of both Houses, who were respoDsible to their consituents and who would be held responsible by their constituents; but he thought, with great deference to the meeting, that the large outstnding manes should be consulted and allowed an opportunity of exercising their constitutional privilege of expressing their sentiments to the Ieisture. (Hear, hear.) He was not in favour of adoptig any esolution that would pledge them to a particular course during the psage ofthe Bill through the H ouse. In order to give effect to their iews he would move That a committee be appointed to watch the progress of the BilL, and to report to a meetin8 fterbd from time to time." g of their body Mr. Mlooe saiddt'hat the difference between the resolutions before them and that now submitted to them was, that the former proposed to do absolutely what the latter contemplated effectmg by calliig another meeting. The I only part of Mr. Ryley's proposition which was valuable, and which was not contained in Mr. Walls's proposal, was the suggestion that certain gentlemen should be appointed to draw up the petition. After afew words from Mr. LA2NGDAL4 Mr. Ryley withdrew his motion. The O'DONOGE inquired whether, in the event of the meeting agreeing to the resolutions before them, the members of the House of Commons precent would consider themselves pledged to support Mr. Dea's amendment? Mr. DE VERE said he considered the present was the proper time, when mnembers who intended to be honest should stand up and say they would hold themselves free, and be influenced only by their own conscientious opinions. Mr. LANGDALE said that the meeting was called to enable hon. gentlemen togive an expression of their opinion and he did not think any non. member would be bound, in his legsative capacity, by any resolution to wbich they might *gree that day. any resoluon of that meeting was theexpression of the opinion of the meting and of the gentlemen who composed it. hlr.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MATCHES TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-But afew days ago you gave in a prominent part of your paper * full and accurate report of the celebration of the 4th of June at Eton. Although I cannot expect that you will give this letter as prominent a position, yet I do hope that you will not too hastily consign it to that oblivious depositoryyour "waste paper basket," for the subject to which I venture to ask your " high consideration" is one, believe me, in which not a few of your readers take a deep and important interest. It is, to come to the point, the recent decision of the authorities of Eton and Winchester to discontinue the annual public school matches at Lord's cricket-ground. Of course, it is not for me to question the authority by which those matches have been abolished, nor the reasons which actuated Drs. Goodford and Moberly in arriving at such an unfortunate decision; but I wil venture to appeal to them, through the medium of your columns, to give to Eton and Winchester men some justification for so arbitrary and despotic a determination. Up to the present time not the slightest reason has been assigned for the perpetration of so dictatorial an act. Numerous reasons for it, however, are afloat, and one of the chief is said to be the " immorality" which is occasioned among the "boys" who take a prominent share in 'he matches. Sir, as an old Etonian, and one who holds the glorious foundation of King Henry VI. in the deepest and greatest veneration, I must most indignantly repudiate the notion that the slightost grounds whatever exist for fastening so base a caltmny upon the public school matches at Lord's. If it be on the ground of " immorality" that the matches have been stopped, then I maintain that it is the bounden duty of the authorities of Eton and Winchester to show upon what foundLtion they build so serious a charge. I anticipate it would be a heavy task for them to vindicate their asstions. " Not proven" would be, I am sure, the unanimous verdict of aU public school men. It is impossible, I think, to exaggerate the happiness and pleasure which the annual gathering of the public schools at Lord's created. It would be found not more in the spirit of generous rivalry which actuated the plaTers themselves thin in the friendly greeting, the cordial shake of the hand, the renewal of acquaintance long since, for various reasons, discontinued, and the interchange of goodwill among the " friends of our youth." If it be said that parents object to their sons playing-the correctness of which assertion I much doubt-then let other boys whose parents are less fastidious take their places; if it be a matter of " expense," then let a " fund" be raised, out of which the individual expenses of the matches should t be defrayed. If these be their reasons for stopping the -matches, then let the authorities boldly and fraDkly say so, for, if theyhbe the only ones they have, then the matter can easilybe rectified; but at any rate let themanot attempt to fasten upon a harmless and innocent gathering a stigma of " immorality, " which can neither be justified by fact nor qualified by proof. If I have written somewhat strongly upon this subject it Is because I feel very strongly the utter injustice and unrea. Fonableneas of the act. I have conversed with numbers of Eton men on the matter, and all express the same strong Ieeling of indignation and their utter inability to account for the change. A piprt of innovation has for some time ast taken hold of the authorities of Eton. If it continue *o be exercised much longer, then mustlEton bidfarewell to hetitle ofbeinga "public" school. Let me express a fervent hope, howrever, that the College authorities will stop before they utterly degrade her; and let Eton men cordially join in the aspiration that they will uphold, in the widese sense of thle word, the glorious motto "IForeat EEtona." Apologizing for intruding so long upon your valuable space, I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant. at VIA) COLLEGER- dune i. .b.

CITY SEWERS COMMISSIO0r. The Commisdoner of Sewers met yesterday at their chamber, Guildhall, Mr. Deputy Bower presiding. RESIGNATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OP TE COMISSION. At the opening of the business, hMr. ABfiAlA said he was deputed by their chairman, Mr. Deputy PFecock, to deliver a letter ontaing his resignation, and when that letter had been read he (ir. AbraaTm) wQuld aubmit a resolution on the aubjeet Mr. DAWV, chief clek, then read thb letter, in which Mr. Deputy Pesoock ztated that having been vidted by a severe bodily affliction, which prevented him from givinD proper attention to pdblic daties, he felt oompeUed to rein offioe as chairmau of that eommiasion, and in so doing he returned his warmest thanks to his colleagues for the kindnew which he had ever met with at their hands. Mr. A3n&HAsN cffinuted-He WAS sre there was but one feeling a.mong the members of that conmision with regard to the communication which hadjust beenroad, ard that feeling wone of deep regret that :any circumstance should have arisen to render it neeeusary for Mr. Deputy Peacock to tender his rsegnation of the chairmanship of thatcommiaoon. (Xea, her.) He (ilr. Abraham) intended to move thst tbat reignation should be no - cepted,andhe should do so from conviction thathewasper. forming his dutyt ldr.DeputyPeacock, from his conviction that that gentleman had well considered the tepa hich he had taken, and from a oonvicUon that, from his knowwsweZe of honour and atrict sene of duty, to hold tho office of chairman and be unable properly to discharge his functions would render him unmesy in his mind, while the disease from which he suffered was of anature to make it neoegsary that his mind should remain as easy and a serene as pos. sible. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Peacock ad been inpblic life for 40 years, for nearly 12 of which he had been chairman of that commission; and he had now attained the age of nearly 78 yeara, a period of life when upon the score of age alone men might well claim to retire from the active duties of public life. (Her, hear.) If honesty of purpose, maintained through a long course of public service, the possession of kind and generous sympathies constantly developed, and devotion of time and energies to the public service gave a man a claim to the regard and esteem of the public, then had Mr. Deputy Peacock clearly entitled himself to public gratitude. (Hear, hear.) But they in that commission espedaUlly,Who had had the honour and the han^ piness to asociate with him for many years of his public career, had been able to observe his deep devotion to his duties, and to experiece that kindness and uarbanity of hearing which lhe ws sre must make them all regret the mness which had compelled him to resign hs office. (Hear, hear.) In oonclusicn, he submitted the following resolu. tion: That this commsion deeply reooet the iesx of Mr. DeatyPee- coc.D and with mu relutnce aoemt his mesignation of offic teir chairman: tha thSeoMMIIon, destre hereby toeXprmtheirsaion regrdnd esteamfor hmm a oolleaiv e andafrpnbdtoeir warmest thanks.to himn for the efficient. impartlal. and fathful manner in which he hasdiechargl hizdutles'as chahirmnfor ieaI 12,as and tbeir earnaithope tbatbishealth my sooube y b ed;. an is life spared for many fean to come. (Hear, hew.) Mr. DE Jfda warmly seconcded the raoion, which, after Mr. Ross, Mtr. Elliott, Mr. H1. I. Taylor, and the Chairman had severally expressed their highi appreciation of Mr. Peacockes many private and public virtues, was carried by acclamation. An offcia op y of the vote was ordered to be forwarded to Mr. Deputy Peacock, and Tuesday next was fixed for the election of his successor in the chair of the commision. SANITARY CONDMON OF T CTY. Dr. Lm my reported on the condition of 193 houses Inspected since the last meeting of the Court, and submitted a list of 108 places reqTiing vaious sanitary improvements. He also furnished certificates of overcrowding of seyral houmes in Helmet-court, Updper Thames-street, and in Clo. ment's-place, IAmb-alley, and directed the attention ofthe Court to the condition of tenements in Chequer-yard, whete several cellars were improperly used as sleeping room. The mortality tables were referred to as indicatinga favourable state of the public health during the past fortnight, there having been but 80 deaths within the city during that period. The 1msual steps with regard to the anitary improvements referrred to in the report wereordered to be taken. On the motion of 31r. Deputy WrETESwD, the rules and regulations for common lodging-houses at present in force wvithin the city were referred to a committee for the pwrposte ocnsab{aidering thPeprorprlieOty o°f ttheir being rescinded, Letheby and better suited to present necessitles.

ST4TE OF TRADE. MANCHESTEE, JuxE 9. Yarns have generally been id. to ld. per lb. derer, and there has been a rather excitedt market in cloth. This aud, den change in the market is almost entirely due to the enhanced prices of cotton at Liverpool. There was nothiug In the recent aceoonta from India to justify any improvement, but 40-inch shirtings suitable to that market are 1td. per piece dearer. The advices from China, and the rise in cotton have affected goods moro decidedly for that market, from their being scarcer, and Slb. 4o0 CVhina shirtings ar very difficult to buy, very few of these cloths having been recently made. They may be quoted 3d. per piece dearer, but are still very unremanerative to the makers, who were recently losing 8d. to Ls. per piece on all they manufactured. There has been a more active and general demand for cloths of all kinds to-day, but stooks ame not sufliciently diminished to enable sellers to realize an advance on any class except those above referred to. For yarns the demand was chiefly for India, China, and Germany, and in these descriptions there was a good business effected in the latter part of the day at fully id. advance upon the rates paid lhst week. Home trade yarns were dul, and the business very limited. Messrs John Slagg and Co. report;-"The alight improvement noticed on Tuesday last continued, and becaue more general during the week, and, notwithstanding the holydays, a fair amount of buainess was transacted. To-day, in consequence of the upward tendency of tho cottonmarket, there is n still more active and more general demand, and prices of all kinds of goods are firmer. Wt CannOt howrever guote any setual advance, except on 40inch shirtings, which are full lld. per piece higher than they ~v,ere a week or 10 days ago.'s LEEDS, Jim-E 9. The trade of this district continues in muck the same state as has lately been reported. The cloth-halls were mode. rately well attended this morning, and about an average Tuesday's business was transacted, principally in heavy goods and mixtures for the fall trade. HUDDERSFIELD, Jums 4. Thingsare looking somewhat more promising uponthe whole here, and a rather better feeling prevailed in the market this morning. There is a slightly improved demand for fancy cloths, and Ljondon bayers have also made somie mnoderate purchases in low-priced goods. The transactions in all departmentb, howrever, oontinued on a comparativelj limited scale, Wool has not materially altered.
