To the 'ELECTOES8 of the COUNTY of DORSET. Gentlemen,
ERM jsyhaving been advised to dissolve the
H alaet, we again solicit at Your hands a renevml of that support which youbhav hitherto so generously extended to us.
We gavre our cordial ausistance to the Governiment In thepiresecutlon of a just and necewsary war, but we did not hesiiato to declare our disaPproval of a war which -we believe to be neither just nor necessary.
We especially dealre to enterour ytest against the doetzinetha a Colonial Goveror Is entitled to InToveftbia country in War,
To makce war Is the prerogative of the Sovereign, acting under the advice- of the reponslblo Mdinisters of the Crown. DIsapproving of the origin of the hoetilities and of the bombardment of Canton we, rieverthele.e, entirely concur in those measuenee which have been taken by the Government to peotect British life and iropertyagaiuat the atrocious system of reprisals adopted by the Chinese Since the formation of the Government of Lord Palmurestn. we have on many occasons glven him our support when his views have beent of a, GoD-
servative tendency. We have nko intention ef changing the course hitherto so pursued by us. and, In recording our votes on tho Chinese quesition, we were actu%ted by no factous motive, nor by a deeire to overthrow the existing Government.
Should you do us the honounr to re-elect us as we shall apply to the conelderation of the gret questionsi of the day thoese Coniservative priutiples which We hIAve alWays profeesed. Adherence to these prInciples by no meanus require oppoeltlunxto all change; on thecoontrary, the truie Conservative prinolIs) Is by a prompt redrass oni all ral grievances, and by a timelY adoption of those reformswhilch the course of events renders Inevitable, toput a stop to the agitation of thomeerevoluttnssyshemeswhichwouldendan ertecerished inttitutlonx Theatentio of te newParliment Il lmmediately callod to

$i: B.r Hall on 4ntering the Courthouse was received 'with loud cheers and hisse. Among the other gentlemen present wer6 the late Lotd Mayor, Major Reed, XP. Mr.
acob Bell,' r. Peter Graham, Mr. W. Field, Zr. T. D'Iffager, jun., and other well-known electors of the borough4
Mr. D'IYFr xnst jun., moved the frst resolution,-
'That couderiug the efficient ad *ble manner In bhh Lord fPtbent6nsustained it honouor and dignt o the eouny during therecet war, mdercirestaneos of extreme difficbIt7, this meet lug exPrees entire cot5deuoeIn the Govearment over which be pre.
Mr. P. GRAHAM seconded the resolution.
Mr. LmnGHAx, amid shouts of laughter, hisses, and up. roar, moved-as an amendment
- T' hattbe thanks Of this mneetig be given to Mr. Cobdea and the majorityrwho voted with him condening tbe Canton masuscre."
There being no seconder to this amendment, it fell to the ground amnid renewed laughter.
The resolution wAs carried amid tremendos applanse with seven or eight dissentients.
Sir B. IAit then addressed the meeting amid enthu. siastic cheering and some interruption for several minutes. 'Having expressed his thanks for bis reception, which ho
took as evidence of the fact that the vote he had given in support of the Government was in accordance with the feelings of the t of the electors assembled Licheers, and "ot no!"), a it was aconving orof to
mmr, thlat, although thetir lssdtons~ renewed and hled for a foev days, tno ol onehb eoe,n,h hoped, for *many yeas to come. They had been called together, as the bill stated, to express their confidence in the present Government, and disapproval of the factious opposition in tho House of Commons. (Chees, an"o, now") Hevas there to ad. dress them intwo capacities; first, asone of the representatives of that borough, and next as a member of Lord Palmerston's Administrationa (chees), and he begged to say he was proud to hold o9ice in lord Palmerston's Administration. (Tremendous applause, and cries of " Place I") Ay, "plaee asto the individual who thus interrupted-him, hewould defvhim or any other man in that room or out of it to say that, as a Minister of the Crown, he had ever faled in his duty to his constituents loud applause) and to the country. (Renewed cheering.) There would be an opportunity in a few days for those who differed from him to come forward and oppose him. (Eear4. He should be then prepared to defend himself, and he knew' that he should have thousands of electors lso ready to defend him. (Great cheering.) With regard to the moin * point, all he could say was that he did not believe there was an7 man in tho country so capable of takibg the helnm of affairs as Lord Palmerston. JChe6rs, and "No, no '") 'If there was any person let him be named. (Cheers.)
.In the memlbrable speech mnade at tho closo of the late discussiOn on China Mr. Disraeli told Lord Palmerston not to complain to the countr, but to apped to the country (hear hear), and LoIrd ];imerston ha taken him at his word. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston was about to appesito the country, and it was forthe coun.try to say whether he should bo supported or his Government replaced by that coalition which the vast maojority of 'the, people so loudly ahd emphatically condemned. -Sir B. Hall thentoferred to the dreadful state of affairs which ex-stedin regar to the lateorartill LodPalrnerstdn * aed to the head of affairs, and the improvements which Lt once took place in the administrAtion and comforts of the army (hear), and aid when he reflected upon what had taken place he was prepared to state that Lord Palmerston did really deeerve the confidence of the country. ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) He did not mean to say that Mr. Cobden was actuated by any other than conscientious motives; but let him ask himself what opinion the country had formed of the step he hadtaken. (Hear, hear.) The result was that he was obliged to resign the represeitation of the largest constitueney in the world-the West Riding(cheers); and in order to show the feeling which prevailed a committee had been formed At Manchester, and 10,000l. had been raised to remove one of the present members from his seat. (Cheers.) He (Sir B. Hall) believed that another great fact would prove on Friday next the confidence placed in Lord Talmerston. He believed that from the momuent he arrived at Temple-bar, and throughout the route to the Mansion-house, he would be received with the cheers of the people. The hond baronet, in reply to the taunts that he haa -accepted office, sked whether it was not of more advantage to the people that the Administration should be filled by the representatives of populous constituencies than that they should go back to the days of Gatton and Old Sarum ? (The hon. baronet resumed his seat amid loud and long-contmued avplause.)
Mr. CGcHzsTsR moved the second resolution:-
"That the ep;odtion which 'ba been offered to Her Majesty's Government on the pretext of the Chinese war, by a union of discordant parties In the Honusof C ommons, fuly juetifiel An appeal to the people, and this meeting pledges itelftoaffdLord Palmenrton 5tzealouss upport."
(Cheers and some confusion.)
Mr. TAVENEFm seconded the resolution, which was carried with three or four dissentients amid renewed cheering.
The meeting separated, after giving three cheers for Lard PaImerston and three cheers for Sir B. Hall.
LIVERPOOL
A large meeting of Conservative electors was held at the Amphitheatre yesterday afternoon for the purpose of expressing confidence in the Tory candidates, Mr. Thomas Berry Horsfall, one of the members for the boroueh, And Mr. Charles Turner, chairman of the Liverpool Dock Committee. The chair was occupied by }r. John Beck Lloyd, and the stage by a large number of gentlemen, although there was an absence of many of the leading Conservatives in the town.
Mr. JeTAs Hor3rSE moved a resolution to the effect-
"That the warmest thanks of ti3 rneetine be *ccorded to our worthy md tded representative Thomm Berry Horafall, lLP7 for the admirable mannerinwhichhehmattended to all mattersaffecting his constituents, and for the courteons conduct e hasb exhibited to aU partes who have waited uponuhim respecting aoy prirate business"
Mr. G. W. Moss-seconded the motion, which was carried by acclamation.
Mr. HoxssAF4 M.P., in thanking the meeting for this expression of their gooi opinion, said he had not, during the past four years, given a factious vote; that on the recent oansion of Mr. Cobden's motion he had thought it his duty to vote with Her Ma#esty's Government, because he could not agree in a vote which went to censure a galant admizal in the British navy, one of the most humane as well Is one of the most talented men in the aervice, who advised with Sir John Bowring in the whole proceedings - nor could he consent to vote for a resolution vwsehE had the effect of ccnsuring the noble lord (Lord Clarendon) who now presided over the foreign policy of this eountry, and of whom he had entertained the higBest opinion since 184-748, when, in the days of the rebellion in Ireland, he had many opportunities of making himself acquainted with the firmness, the decision, forbearance, and general characteristics of the noble lord. He proceeded next to explain his cipinions On various other questions.

Tho Lighting of To7ns(Ireland) Act Amendment Bill was read a third time and passed.
The Commissioners of Supply (cotland) Act 1856 Amendment Bill passed through ¢ommittee.
THE INCOME-TAX BILL.
Earl GRANVILE moved the second reading of this Bill.
The Earl of DERBY then rose and said, -I need hardly assure your lordships that it is not my intention to availmyself.of the present opportunity for offering any objection to the Bill, the second reading of which has just been moved in silence by the noble earl the President of the CounciL Ah the same time I cannot conceal the expression of my regret that it has not been found consistent with the public service to defer the consideration of a measure so important as this until the new Parliament which is about to be summoned should be enabled to take it into consideration in connexion with the whole of the financial state of the country. (Hear, hear.) That Parliament wil, in my judgment, greatly fail in one of its first duties if in tho earliest period of its existence it does not take into active and serious consideration the whole state of the finances and taxation of the country. (Hear, hear.) I need not say that with respect to legislation on the subject of taxation your lordships have nothing more to do than that which simply consists in bearing your allotted portion of the burden. I have heard in various quarters of propositions for rendering taxation andrepresentation co-extensive, but I have never heard, and I do not expect to hear, of any proposition either for relieving your lordships from the pressure of taxation, which you have no voice in imposing, or for giving to your lordships, in your legislative capacity, the power of dealing with our revenue, or, inyour individual capacity, the right, which helongs to the humblest elector in the country, to choose the representatives who enact the imposition of taxation. Nevertheless, asyou have that slight interest in taxation which is involved in having to pay it, I do not think the sub. jeot' altogether unworthy of your consideration. I confes3 I look with deep anxiety onthe present state of the finances of the country. (Hear, hear.) For some time past it has been understood on all hands that at the earliest possible moment the income-tax, so universally condemned in public opinion, and in the eye of every public man, would cease, and' that henceforth it should be considered as heretofore it had, as a most efficient and useful engine in time of war, but should be kept strictly and exclusively for the emer. gences and extraordinary expenses of war, and be strack out altogether from the system of taxation in time of peace. I had undoubtedly indulged the san. guinu expectation,andhave notyetaltogether abandoned the hope, that we might with tho year 1860 see the realization of that which I tall the pledge given by the Government of 1853, that at that period the income-tax should altogether cease and determine; bat I am bound to point out and submit to the Government the present position of the floalces, which, I confess, unless some vigorous and active measures are taken, leave me little expectation that that pledge can be fulOled. In the present year the Chancellor of the Exchequer calculates on having a surplus of somewhere about 500,0001. It was a portion of the arrangements made in 1853 that in order to provide for the gradual abolition of the income-tax in 1860 that tax should be reduced, from the 5th of April, 1857, from 7d. to Sd. in the pound, and so to remin until its fial extinction. Bat war super. vened, and so far from its being possible to reduce tha income-tax during the continuance of the war it was found necessary to double its amount from 7d. to 14d. in the first instance, and subsequently to increase it still further to 16d. in the pound. The last Act was Introduced by the present Chaneellor of the Exchequer. The Act which preceded it bore on its face that the income-tax levied for the war should continue for one year after the conclusion of the peace and no longer. The Act introduced by the present Government professed to bear the same condition on its face and to be nothing more than the extension of the amount of the tax from 14d. to 16. in the pound, but by that which has been represented to be a mere slip of the pen-a mere casual erior, it did so turn out that from the words of the Act-" the period at which peace shall be concluded and ratified"-the letter of the law, which professed to keep the extraordinary taxation for one year after the termation of the war, practically continued it for two years. It was admitted on all hands that that was not the intention of Parliament, and it was loudly declared by the Government that they would be ashamed to avail themselves of so paltry a quibble. Now, if they did not choose to avail themselves of so paltry a quibble, the simple process would have been to repeal the Act from the time it was intended to cease, the consequence of which would have been that on the 5th of April next ensuing the income-tax would have been reduced to 6d. in the pound; and I cannot but express my deep regret, on account of the principle involved, that under these circumstancoe the Chancelor of the Exchequer should have taken advantage of that casual error in the Act of Parliament, not, indeed, for the purpose of keeping up the whole wartax for',the present year, hut of making an addition of 2d. in the pound, and that for the ordinary purposes of taxation, beyond the amount to which It was the intention of Parliament the tax should be reduced. (Hear, hear.) You may say what you please, but that act on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was an act to the extent of 2d. in the pound, which means 2,000,0004, to increase the amount of the income-tax for ordinary, and not for extraordinary, revenue. I regret deeply that which appears to be in principle an invasion of the arrangementslaid down in 1853; but with this addition of 2,000,OOOl the Chancellor of the Exchequer calculates that in the year 1857-58 heowillhave a surplus of 500,000h That calculation of surplus revenue proceeds on the assumption that the expense of the war with Persia will not exceed 250,0004, and also on the further assumption that there will be no extraordi. nary demand on the resources of the country in the present year. Consequently, no provision is made for that most calamitous war-and, I am afraid, most expensive war-in which we are unhappily involved, by no choico of our own, with China. (Hear, hear.) But upon the impossible assumption that the war with Chinawill cost nothing, and on the improbable assumption that the war with Persia will cost no more than 250,0004, the balance of revenue over expenditure In the present year will give, according to the Chancellor of the Ex. chequer, a surplus of 500,0004 To mako that surplus of 500,0001. you will receive in the present year a half-year's amonnt of the 9d. war income-tax, amounting in round numbers to 4,500,000v. That source of revenue will fail you altogether in 1858. Therefore you will have your revenue in 1858, as compared with 1857, di-ninished in the first place by4;500,0004 of war income-tax. If thelaw stands without alteration that revenue will hereafter be diminished by a fall on tho.5th of Aprilnext year of income-tax from 7d. to {d., which would make a further reduction of 2,000,0001., or, making allowance for a half-year of that 2d. to be collected, it would make the reduction of 1,000,000u . Therefore you would have in the revenue in 1858, a8 compared with 1857, a defici-ncy of 5,5uO,000. But, in addition, there is a provision that in 1858 there should commence a sinking fund to provide for the debt raised by the present Chancoellor of the Exchequer, which will swell your expenditure up in 1858 above 1857 to the amount of nearly 1,50v,000. Therefore, there is a prospect that in 1858 there will he a diminished
revenue of 5,500,0001. and en increased expenditure of 1,50,0001., leaving'a balane to deficit of nearly7,000,000M, against which you have to set your suplus of the present Year of 0,0001. So you stand at preseunt. You find, by the programme of the Govermnent, that, with no extraordinary expenses, and with war with Persis and Chna,
you. have.* deficiency in 1858 of 6,500,000. I will not go so far forward as 1860, when you will recollect that to
Sary out the plan of 1853 the whole of the remaiing Income-tax is to be tcrificed, which wi make a further reduction of 5,000,000., because there will be some items lling in,-such as 1,300,000. of long anuities;
and there will be a cessation of the payments, amounting to 2,00,0001-, on acount of thor Exhequer-bonds. It I's sul,cient toASuSe tat in consequence of the further

But it ild be fllyt6anppoaetlM the increased productiveness of the existing taxes couldraise therevenue to anytbing. approaching 6,500,0001. in:thecourse of a single year. With regard tolthe second mode, I know with what distaste and distZust 'the country looks to new taxes in lime of profound peace. There remains, then, the third mode-a close and rigid attention to economy, and a strict reduction of -national expenditure. (Hear, hear.) The principal branches of ihitt national cx_ penditure are, first, the payment of the national debt, which cannot be reduced, except: under peculiar circumstances, with due regard to faith towards the public creditor. Next come the civil establishments, in which I do not think any material reduction canbe effected; and then come the three great branches of thearmy, the nasy, andithe miscellaneous estimates. My lords, it is in these three-brAnches, and in these alone, that any considerable reduction of expenditure can take place. (IHear.) I should be one of the last to wish to see the miitay establishments of this country reduced below a state of efficiency. I should be aorry to see them reduced to the point at which they were kept between the years 840 aud 186. (Hear, hear.) I think that such a state of our military establishments is not consistent either with the honour or the safety of the country. The only principle awhich I recommend is that which combines economy with a direct regard to the efficiency of the public service, and that which I am most anxious to vindicate and support isthe necessity of keeping your military and naval establishments asstrong as you can in all that relates to science, and thatwhich cannot be produced on the spur of the moment or in the efflux of a moderate space of time, but placing your army in that state of efficiency in which it is the duty of the Government and of the country to place itorganically strong, but numerically as low as is consistent with the duties it bas to perform in time of peace. (Cheers.) I lay this down as a principle, but I shall not pretend to enter into details on this subject. With regard to the miscellaneous estimates, they have increasedmost formidably in the last few years, and this not from any fault of this or that Government, but from the pressure and extravaganco of Parliament. (Hear.)It has formerly been the theorythat Parliament ougnt to be the check unon the tendency of Governments to spend money; but with regard to the miscellaneous estimates the duties and positions of these two bodies have been reversed, and the Government has been the check, but not a sufficient check, upon the extravagance of Parliament. (Cheers.) I do not propose to go further, and I will therefore only urge upon the consideration of your lordships and the country that if it is desirable to get rid of the income.tax, and if we do not wish to see it incorporated into our system of taxation, we must, in the years between this and 1860, apply ourselves vigoroudy and rigidly to such a s"stem of economy and of reduction in our expenditure as is consistent with the attainment of that object, and so as to render it possible to square your balance of revenue and expenditure. My lords, it is quite-obvious that the expenditure of this country, with respect to the nature and extent of your warlike establishments, depends upon the system of policy that is to be pursued, and more especially upon the system of foreiga policy that is to be pursued by the Government. (Cheers.) If you -determine that thaw policy shal be one of respect forthe independence and for the rights of foreign nations-of studious absti. nence from interfering with the purely internal con. oerns of other countries-of an anxiety to avoid by every possible means a language, tone, and temper which shall show you ready to substitute in case of fancied insult and injury a tone of menace and braggadocio for that of reason and conciliation-if you are slow to take offence and ready to give reparation, when it is asked forin a friendly spiritif you do this I have no fear, in the present condition of the world, and with the general feelg that prevail in nearly all foreign nations, that we must be prepared to keep up large war establishments In time of peace. But if you proceed upon an opposite poliy, and are determined to meddle in tho iternal concerns of other countries,-if you attempt to dictate the tone in-which they shal deal with their own subjects, and interfere with them when the interests of your own subjects are not concerned, -if you threaten, and bully, and use the language of menace to those who, although weak, are too proud to listen to you, when you tol them how to behave towards their own sabjets,-if you adopt such a course of conduct, I take the liberty to tell your lordsbips that you must keep your establishm ents upon a war footing-that you must be prepared to back up every petty guarrel in which you may bo involved, that you must
rea yto provide on the shortest notice for a war that mayspread over the whole faee of the world. And, my loras, above all, if you lay down this formidable and dangerous princple that your subordinate officers in every part of the worldi shal have the poer at their discretion of commltting this country to a war-if you lay down the further principle that, right or wrong, after they have done those acts they must be approved by the Government-and if you lay down the fher principle that those acts, being thus approved by the Government, it is beyond tho competenee ofPari1ament to take Cognizanee of those transactions, with the view of condenniu them upon pain of being charged with a factions combination againss the Government, then, my lords, you may give- up t e idea of reducing our army, you must hold yourselves armed eap-a-ieforthe hGght, and you must be ready to plunge into the horrors of war in every part of the world at the discretion of men proud of their brief authority, andready tomakethemostof theconfidenceof theGovernmentatbhome And this, my lords, leads me to the peculiar circumstances under which an appeal Is to be made to the country. Your lordships need not apprehend that I am about to enter into the merits of the Chiina war, or to examine tho legality of the proceedings of Sir J. Bowring, or the prudenco of the steps he has taken. I am going to assume for the present that the whole of those steps were legal ; but I desire to point out to your lordships the position in which this country is placed by the adoption of these assumed legal prooeedings of Sir J. Bowring. It is no littlc inconvenience and no slight public evil that in the month of March, just at the commencement of the session, and when the House of Commons were about to commence the business of the counts7 we should be interrupted in our proceedings by a dissolution of Parliament-a dissolution that creates the greatest possible inconvenience both to
bli and private affairs, and which involves not only the os of time of the dissolution itself, but that fuither loss of time caused by the arrangements consequent upon the meetIng of the now Parliament, and which will render this coming Parlaiment even more unproductive of beneficial measures than was promised us in the very meagre programme of the Speech from the Throne at the commencement of the present session. My lords, of course that inconvenienc is to be endured. I shall be told that the Government having had a hostile vote passed against them it became necessary for them either to resign ortoappealtothe country. But, mylords, whose fault was it that a question was ever raised involving the character or credit of the Government? I am going very humbly to offer my apology for your lordshipse House and for the House of Commons for havin so far misunderstood the spirit of the constitution rs toUbefiev that it was within theircompetencetotake notice, and, having taken notice, to express an individual opinion upon the conduct of any official with reg to whose proceedings the Government, by command of Her .ajesty, had laid
aper and documents before Parliament. I may be mistaken, but Idcertai y belived that when papers are laid upon the table by Her jesty's Government it is for the very purpose of invitin an expression of the opinion of Parliament upon them. ly lords, I conceive it cannot be said that, in respect either to this or the other House of Parliament, we have been anxious to interfere with the discharge of the duties of the executive, or that we have inter. posed any obstacles in the way of the exercise of those functions which properly belong to the Crown. They have manaed, on the contrary, to dllay a degree of forbearance which I do not blame, but which I venture to say is almost unparalleled. (Hear, hear.) What is the ease with regard to the war in Persia? A quarrel bas been entered into, troops have been despatched, war has'been declared, an ex edi on has been sent out, a fortress has been taken, negotiations have been entered into, negotiations have Leen concluded, peace has been made, and from the irst to thelast, from tehourwhenthe quarrel bean to the moment when I am addressing your lordships, the House of Lords and the House of Commons have not had one single scrap of paper or one single official document which shows the object, the cause, the intentions of the war, or the terms on which it isterminated; andtheHouseof Commons, which ought to furnish supplies upon an estimate of expenses, aro not likely to know anything about that expense until they are called on to paythe bilalready dischargedby Her Majesty's Government. (Cheers.) Therefore Isavthe House of Lords and the House of Commons bave dispTayed uo undue aiety tointerfere with the Government or to hamper or embarrass the Executive. (Hear, hear.) But,
whe paersarelai beorePariamnt,it is an invitation on the pert of etkhe iCbrefown fpor airliaments to express its
opinion on the subject matter of those papers, and if we do not, we-grossy neglect our duty, as by tacit acquiescence we mzay be assumed to sanction acts most '.pRnnttoou
hear.) What has taken plac in this instance?. lUosb theperusal of these papers a motion was made in the other House of Parliament by a gentleman usually, I believe, a supporter of Her Majiests Government, and most undoubt. edly wholly unconnected with the Conservative party. That motion expressed on the face of it-I forget the precise words-the opinion of the Houee of Commons, that tho papers laid on the table failed to afford sufficient justification for the officials in China. I gave notice and brought forward in this House a motion varying in terms, bat entirely to the same effect; and wlhat was the course pursd by Her-Kaesty's Government in both Houses' Why to assume to themselves the wholeresponsibility of the conduct and judgment of Sir J. Bowrlng; to make thomsdves parties- to insist on being sentenced, or rather to insist that P arlament should either forbear expressing an opinion or be chaged with a desire to censure or displace Her Majeet"s Government. Now, I will venture to say that., instead of .Her Majesty's Government nndicating to the uttermost the conduct of: their agnta, they ad come forward and epressed theig own honest ana dncere convictions that, -with they-s- intentions, a hasty and ifi-judged atop taken by thiplen1potentiary had inolved consequences which he woul% be the frst to regrt andth last to contemplte - that they eould notaltogether 'vindicate the courte he ka~ pursued, but allowance oughtLtobermnade for thedifrieoltof the titon in whihch he was placed, and concludingwgih a, .injTtat5io of their.. intention to do-thAt- which -they- havler done; aiubsequently,. to BenidoQIranotlher plenipotentiary with full poDwers, it iaot to anpe~iede,toovride the authorityfta ffc n

It was not we, or tbe other House of Parliament, 'but theywhomadethemselves respousible for the conduct of their agents. (5JheeraL) And here let me warn the Government. However unami
mons it may seem, however grand it may sound, to say that on all occasions a public servant-more especially an absent publie tervant-is to be defended, you onugl only to carry tbat asfar as is consistent with justice. (iear,hear.) You may carry it even as far as is consistent with indulgence
butwhen it comes to the point that by the indiscretion of a public servant the country Is plunged in a war, the expenses of which are not to be calculated and the horrors of which are not to be told, then, I say, if thit public servant is to receive the sapport of the Government to the extent of insisting on dissolving Parliament if Parliament does not concur with him, you are giving a most exorbitant premium to imprudent condact, to hasty aCtions, and to want of a due sense of their proper responsibility to every gentleman yo I employ in every part of the world.. (Lon d cheers.) Bnt if you considereda th
conduct of your agent so entirelyblameless-if you thought the papers quite justiried his pridence, *nd showed him to be the fittest man to conduct affairsfhthat'in,l whysuertede him? (Hear, bean) Inknot not whether a he dafermination to send out that stperseding officerwas come to I before or aiter the division of the House of Commons, but
in either case it affords to the m jority of that Honse af le vindication for the vote to which they came. (Hear.) of it were the intention of Government previous to thate debate to supersede Sir J. Bowring, in the first place they ought frankly to have satd so, which would have put an end to the discussion, and, in the next place, it argues £ foregone conclusion in their minds that the papers did nmoi justify the conduct of Sir t. aowr,ng. l Her,hoar.) If that intention were only formed after the mepision of the House of Commons had shown what wras the opiniSon of the representatives, of the country, I say the House of Commons prormed a signal service in cornlueDng the Govern. ment, by their vote- to do that which they ought to have done voluntarily, ln either case the vote of that majority is amply justified, if only by the fact that, having vainly attempted to vindicate his conduct, the Government roceede to supersede Sir John Bowring, Hear, hear.) Who moment, my lords, that majority was declared there arose a cryof "factious combination," "annaturalcoalition," "unprincipled attempt to overthrow7 the Government." There arose chargesmost revoltin to the feelings of every honourable man-charges which I shall prove to be as base as they are unfounded,-charges which I do not think anyrof your lordships, at all events, will have the courage to stand forward and gupport. (Hear, hear.) For myself I will only say-and I say it on the word and honour of a peer ana of a gentleman-I do not know, and I have not known, of any concert, of any combination, of any areement, of any understanding with regard to those voWeand those motions in either House of Parliament between any persons not professing precisely tho same political opinions. (Cheers ) distinctly and solemnly declare I have been no party to such concert or combination, and I as emphatically declare my solemn conviction that the vote arrired at in the House of Commons was the result of no combination, of no concert, still less of any desire to coalesce against the Government for politioel objects, bat that it was the spontaneous expe'esson of opinion, reluctan'tlv expressed by many, with regard to the condauct of officials whom the Governmeht supported. (Cheers.) What I have stated now vwll, Ihope, carry conviction to the minds of all of those with whom I have the honour of personal acquaintance, and Itrust also to the minds of many more to whom lam not personally known. But I wil proceed to stte facts which I think will convince the moet sceptical that there cannot be any coalition of this kdnd. Your lord;hips will, perhaps, have done me the honour of recollecting thatupon the firstnightof thesession, having no information but what was to be derived from the public papers, I expressed great aniet with regard to the position of affairs in China. I expressed doubts as tothe legality and prudence of the course pursued, and great ap. prehensions that the course pursued would be prodauctive of signal disaster. Shortly afterwards the papers were laid upon the table of the House, and I made it my duty most carefuly and. most anxiously to eaumine their contents. The information furnished by Her Majesty's Government strengthened and confirmed the impression which I had previousy received. I gave notice accordingly of my intention to brig forward certain resolutions, and at the same time I asked to be furnisheda with other papersnecessAry to the full elucidation of the case. I thank the Government for the ready courtesy with which they furnished every information on the subject; but, haing read thosepapers, I came to the conclusion that it was my bounden Tury to bring that case under the conasideration of your lordships. I did not mention that Intention of mine to above three or four persons of those most Intimately and politically connected withme; and, untl the time I came into this House and laid the resolutions on the table, I believe I am literally correct in saying nso hnman being had seen those resolutions or was responsible for one syllable they contained. (Hear, bear.) If the House of Commons is to be accused of factious coaltion and unprincipled combination, why is not the same charge and the same imputation made here ? The charge is as applcable to one House as to the other. (Hear, hear.) How was the party formed which supported mny resolution in your lordhiiPs' House ? Not only of thoee noblemen w ansually sit upon this side, and share to a great extent in my political opinions, but it comrised also the two noble earls a posite (Earls Aberdeen and.rey)
and the noble lord the &ntroller of the Exchequer (lord Monteagle). My resolution was also suppor,i by a noble earl than whom there is not a more stanch supporter of Her Majesty's Government, nor a mnore decided Whig of the old schLool. I waa supported by the high, authority of Eala itzwillam, an d Her Majesty's Government do not appear to have borne him any ill-will for his share in this supposed combination, if I may assnme for a fat the statement which has been made in the public journals, that his eldest son has recently been appointed Lord-Lieutenant of the West Riding of York . (" ear, " and a laugh.) I said Ohad no combination or concert with any person before I came into this House, and I spoke the exact and literal truth. But when I came into this House I took an opportunity of showing to my noble and learned friend now at the table (Lord L3Fndhurst) the resolution which I had prepared, and I had the good fortune to find that it met with his entire approvaL There was at the time sitting by my noble and learned friend a Whig peer, a man of great eminence, a distinuised and cordial supporter of Her Majesty's Government. He asked if I wold allow him to see the resolution. I said, certainl, i' be wished it.
Having read over the resolution carefuy he asked me whether hadany objection to strike out one phrase. Ireplied I had not, and gave the noble lord. a pen, with which he made the erasure he desiredL I thenlaughingly observed, As you have altered my resolution to meet your views, I hope to hAve your is pot.

ileIrefuseto go into ajustification of these ppointrments, I must declare my conviction that my noble friend bas been actuated by a desire to do that which is best for the chhurch and agreeable to the great body of churchmen, and that he has been particularly anxious in miakin*these appointments to secure harmony in the respective districts for which these prelates and others have been selected. The nob.e earl hasmade anattack ofasomewhatpersonal character uponmy noble friendatthehead of the Government. The best answer I can give to that attack is to remind yourlordships that in 1855 the noble earl offered my noble fiHend one of the most important places that a noblo lord could occupy in the service of the Crown. (Hear.) The noble earl (Derb), when a member of the other rionse, was one of the most popular membersin it; but since that time, from eircumstauces to which it is not necessary to allude, me noble friend has beaten him completely in that race. It is easy to understand why the people of this country approve Lord Pamerston and wish to retain him as Prime Minister. I have heard it said that those Sovereigns who have been raost fortunate in their dominions have been those who have shared the faults and virtues of the people whom they have governed. With regard to my noble friend, I believe that his character, his opinions, and feelings ae singularly in unison with those of
t peop e of this country. The people of this country know tbat he bas been a long and faithful servant of the Crown. When be was acting with my noble friend near me (the Earl of Aberoden) hc nover departed from a straightforward and honourable course of conduct as the colleague of my noble friend. ("Hear, hear," from the Earl of Aberdeen.) The People of this countryconsider thepositionof mynoble friend when he accepted the Government. The country was then in critical circumstances. There had been no Government for three weeks. Her Maiesty, following that constitutional maxim which she has ever adopted, sent for every political leader who had any chance of forming a Government; and it was only after she had exhausted the list that my noble frdend acceted the task of forming an Administration. Some noblelords were at that time thinldng more of their position of ease and repose than doing likewise. The noble earl has himself praised the industry of my noble friend at the head of the Government,-the spirit and vigour Iwih which he carried on the war, and the shill and firmness which, in conjunction with my noble friend (the Earl of Clarendon), he displayed in obtaining the performance of the treaty. Theposition of the noble earl'spatyLas not been improved snce the country has seen the combination formed against my noble friend and his Government; and the feeling of the country has been that there is somethig not quite English and not quite fair in such proceedings. The noble earlhas complained of the dissolution; and that Lsastrildng fact, because thenright hon. gentlemnanwholeads the noble earl's party in the other House declared that this was a perfectly riRht course to adopt. It was only after the noble ea-l had had some opportunity of reflection and of considering some circumstances to which I will not further allude that he thinks the dissolution a very bad thing. (A. lauagh.) N~ow, I am more inclined than ever to think a dissolution a very good thing. I will troulble your lordahips on this subjeotwith a memorandum, written bythe Duke of Wellington, upon the dissolution of Parliament. The Duke
" I confess that I have no feeling upon the point on which the Parliament should be dissolved. The Queen's servants will be placed in the situation of advising Her Majesty to dissolve the Parliament because, on account of the combinations against them in the House of Commons, they are no longer able to carrv on the Queen's service. The question for the country is not the particular question on which the vote has been taken, butin reality whether you are to continue the Ministerandto be supported as the Minister or the Queen is to lookhr other servants? In this view of the case I put out of the question all cries and nic}names, and the effect of them, howrever much thaT may be usd at the elections. The question at the elections wrill be the support of your Administration."
It is a matter of perfect indifference vhetaer the noble earl is able to fi= the dissolution upon the China question, on which I believe my noble friend and his colleagues-for I may claim some shght responsibility-did right in supporting the futhorityof our officials. Upon this question, too, we are borne out by thetestimony of every merchaut and every Christian mission in China. I do not care whethMr the election taL-es place upon that cry or upon the general foreign policy of the Government, or upon its domestic fmincples, or upon the question as Put by the Duke of Wellngton, whether the country i for the iresent Administration or not. I believe that the result of the appeal wmll be triumphant for the Government, and, although the majority may be diminished by a few votes in consequence of coalitions, such as have tak-en place in Tip. perary, still I have no doubt it will be a Majority lrg-e enough to support my noblefriend and the Government n all the measures that they may wish to carry for the im. provement of our existing institutions. (Cheers)
The Earl of MALMESBURY.-I do not think the speech we have just heard is worthy of a noble lord who is the leader of this House. It is to him that we trust to givea proper tone to the debates of this House; and I always remember with gratitude the course taken by the noble marquis (Lans. downe)as long as ha led your lordships. I have heard the speech of the noble earl with great regret; for I do not think it worthy of his place in this House, or worthy of the House itself, after an eminent peer has made a solemn and deliberate declaration to your lordahips that certain accusations and assertions were false, that a noble earl who holds so high a place as that of leader of your lordships' debates should have given so churlish a belief, if indeed belief it were, in what my noble friend said.
EArl GRAINVILLE sid, his belief was sinoere after what the noble eal said.
The Earl of DERBY.-I may perhaps be permitted to state that I made that declaration not on my own part only, but for all those with whom I acted; and I am certsin that not one of them had formed any combination or mnderstanding with any one who did not agree with him in political principle. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of MALlMESBURY.-I believe there never was a vote given so conscientiously by any one of us as upon that question of China. (Hear, hear.) I own that in all doubtful matters we all have a natural bias to follow our party, but upon this qnestion IL never had the ligihtest doubt; and, if my noble friend (the Earl of Derby) had given a vote the other way, I de. clare, as a peer and a gentleman, that I should have voted.as I did. (Hear.) There have been no negotiations or proceedings of any kind that could be construed into such en accusation as that which the noble lord at the head of the Government and others have preferred. God forbid that I should be so presumptuous as to give advice upon the conduct of your lordshiy debates, but we look to the noble earl, as the leader of this House, to show us an example in conducting our debates; anaisitdignifiedorusual to Mudo I to a supped meeting in the tea-rooni between some noble
lord and some hon. gentleman a member of the other Honue it being xaspected that they were conspiring against the Government? Was it dignified in the noble earl to read four or five columns of a newspaper after he had been told that my noble friend knows no more of that paper than the nobleoearlhimself? I trust thatthisis thelaststime, after a peer rises and states solemnly that such and such is the fact, we shall see these shadows of doubt tbrown over what he has said. The noble earl has adverted to the election of Mr. O'Donoghue. I do not know who have supported him. The noble earl-has read from a newspsper the names of certain noble lords who have supported this gentleman, and he seems astonUshed that Lord Dononghmore should have done so. Novw,tappears tome thattnothing-could bomore conslstent, for ever since I can recollect Lord Donoughmore in this Houseshehasbeenanadvocate of tenantigiht; and I re-
member that, in a committee up-staizr he was the main supporter of that principle. If,t then, LordDonoughmore be an advocate of tenant right, wy should he be held up to ridicule by the noble earl for supporting the candidate who holds the same vim? The noble earlappears sanguine as to the result of the Chinese war; now, Ifconfess that I amP not so sangune.
Earl G.ANMIZE.-I did not sy that I Wassnguine as to the result of tho war; wiatI i as, that I ws anguine as to the result of the elections, (Hear, hear)

Now, mylords&,Ihave never for one moment quetioned the jxudgment or the discretion, still less have I questioned the motive, of any gentleman who upon that ocdesion voted against his own paty. I have assumed, as I was boundto do. that very gentleman who h o voted dia so from a conviction thaethe Government had not merited the censUre of Parliamet. There were, to be sure, teasons assigned by xome hon. gentlemen for their votes which do not apper tome to bear conclusively upon the decision they arnved at, We were told that gentlemen could not vote aialnst the Government which made such excellent ececii. astical-appointment. (A laugh.) Nor, mny lords, I am not able to trace the connexion between. the two things, when we arm told that the Government makes excellent eccesisgticsl appolntments, and that therefore Sir J. Bowring, was justified in making War upon Canton. ("Hear,- and laughter.) - However, if the justification of

(Heari, hear.) What do we learn froraddresses now being sinned by members of the House of Commons to their constituents! There is hardly one of those addresses which does not say clrcuastances have occured at Canton which are Tery much to be regretted, and that it would have been very much better if iir J.

They can'tsay hisgonduct was unstifiable; but then comes in the infamous eoalition,'whieh overrides all considerations of justice, nd authori&ed hon. mnembers to vote that Sir J. Bowrnjfs oonduct wras justified by the papers presented to Parhameut, while in their addresses to their constituents those hon. membeors frankly admit that his conduct was not justified. (Hear, hear.) As Ihave said, this cry of combination is nothingnew. LetmereadtotheHousethelanguage of a very eminent satesman when a iilr question was raed in the House of Commons. He says:-
"The hon. and learned gentleman has demanded a fal explanation of the cirumstances under which that vote will be given. Sir, he shall have that explanation. I have no reserve. The hon. and learned member has stated that there is a dishonourable conspiracy formed aginst Her Majest's Government. Sir, a more unfounded charge never vws preferred. He presumes that there has been some base compromise between gentlemen sitting on this sido of the House, but holding different opinions upon matters of vital Interest. He is wholly mistaken. There has been no such compromise. He talks of there being three courses to pursue; he tells us there are three combmitions by which offie may be obtained. Ee says, 'I demand to know which of theEethree courses you oontemplate.' Now, is it not possible for the hon. and learned gentleman to supposo that theremaybeafonrth? Isitnot poenibleforhim toSpeCulate upon the possibiity that men In this House may initend to give their votes without ieferenee to political combina. tons ? Does he exclude the possibility of that fourth course of action, which arises from a conscientious conviction as to the truth? Is tha' excluded fromjsis contemplation? May it not be possuble that men cannot subscribe to a resolution which assert that a certain course has been best calculated to preserve peace and to support the honour and dignity of this country? Is it not possible that, without reference to party or personal interes-, men may decline to affirm a resolution which deals with principles of greater imnortance to the welfare of this country for good or for evil t,n have ever been under the consideration of the House ?'
Now, who were the arties on that occasion? By a singular coincidence the speech was made in the Houe of Commons In consequence of a motion made by me in your lordahips' House censoring the policy or the Govermentr And referring especialy to the department of it whLich was presided over by the noble viscount nowr at the head of the Administration. Hle was the man whose conduct, censured by the House of Lords, he considered in so much doubt as to the judgment of the House of Commons that then, as now, he did not think it unworthy of him to raise the cry of "combinntion and conspiracy," and to attempt to bias the judgmnent of the llouse by the same cry, which his followers were raising with as much truthas now. (Cheers.) The accuser was the same and the defendant was the same. tand who were the parties involvedlintheguiltof thatconspiracy? Mylords,Ineed hardly tell you that the eminent statesman whose language I haveJ jut uoted, wvhose indignant denial of those vie motives I have read to you, that that statesman, so charged with combination and conspiracy, was one Who for four year had given them his constant and unvarying sunportthat that statesman was the late Sir Robert Peel (hear)
and that that speech ws the last be adressed to Parliament but a fewv hours before the unhapipy event which deprived the country of the servies of that emiaent
m (hear, bear.) But who was the man who put himself forwvard as the chivalrous defender of Viscount Pulmerston on that oocasion, and who mnoved the exculpatory zesolution in the House of Commons? That man was Mr. Roebuclr, one of the present supporters and accomplices in this "base conspiracy." (Cheers.) Y lords, I have givon ou facts to show, not theimpghobabilty, but the imposs. bility of such a coaliton. Thi e very notion of it i o absurd for the veriest gobemouc who catches Up and swallows the last neWVpaper cdnard nay, it is even more absurd than that memorable story of whoiesa2e mascre in America of which the most egregious dupe was the lad. lngjournalinthiscountry. (A laugh.) Itis moreincredible thian anythin,g the wildest stretch of imagiation can
icture. But I know well th eese with which, as ha teen somewhere said,
" The barefac'd lie, launch'd writh malignant force, "Unheard by thousands, is believed of course.
(A laugh.) I know the An-tus-like power with which calumny, refuted a dozen times, ever springs from the ground with additiosal strength; and, notwithEtanding the solemn asserion I have made and the
facts I have stated, nothing will surprise me less| than to see the daly press teeming with repetitions of this base and unfounded calurany, or to find it made the stock in trade of electfoneeringaddresses and speeehesdurn the next three months. (Hear.) My lords, I should not wish to say antbing personal; but, by wrhomsoever and wheresoever that shall be sad, written, or printed, I solemnly declare that that statement bears preciseIy that relation to truth which Is expressed in very pithy anld homely lanuapge in the first line of theo q,uotation which J have just read to your lordahips. (A laugh.)
But, my lords, howr long is it since Her Majests Is Government has -had this holy horror of combinations -how long is it since they discovered that the votes of nmen not concurring in general political principles, but joining together en some ,paricular occasions, must neces-
rY be given from factious and unworthy motives? I will not go hack to the ealer history of thelife oE the; noble viscount at the head of Her Mjesty's Government. No man Is better qualed to sieek of combinations than he, because no man has bad a tithe of the experience of them that he has ha.(a la Lugh.) I wFill not go back even to the commencement of the present Parliament; I will be satisfied with reverting to the present session of ParLiament, and recalling to your lordahipa' recollection a certain motion whichwas broughtforward in theHouseofCommons by asupporter of the Government-a gentlemen named MKr. LoOce King-in favour of reform and an extension of the franchise. That motion was opp d by the noble lord at the head of the Governmnent, and to suppoort his opposition to thatv motion of his own supporters and adherents he brought into tho field the magnficent mumber of 31 members, of whom 21 were persns holdin official situations. (A laugh.) Aginst the whole ofhls own suppotters were aryed 179 members, 31 being the numnber of votes which the Government could raise when left to themselves, to their own resources, and to their ovwa supporters. (Alauph.) Onthatoccasion wasthe "combination" rejected with scorn? No t the Consevative party, true to their principles, and casting aside all questions as to whom they were about to support or defend, came to the rescue of the noble vsount, increased that miseraIble nil. nority of 31 to 192, giving the reby a majority of 13 to the noble lord, and that act of the Conservative party saved HerMaesty'sGoverntment from the fate of Acticon -from being devoured by their owtn hounds, and from disgrace and defeat. (Cheers and laughter.) One little fort. night after that timie the party who did this-wrho, regrd. less of political considerations, and looking only to principles, defended and supported the noble viscount aegast his own adherents-pase a deliberate judgmcnt on papers subomitted to their consideration; and thiat part, who from the abeence of factious motives saved his Government from annihilation ontheformeroccasion, are nowehared with a
disgraceful colition forthe pos of oustingthenoble
eountfromoaice. (Cheerslfom theOpposition.) My lords, I
askyonto put these two circmstances together, and say, if such-a charge can be brought aginst either party, to which
rtyit can be falrlyapplied It maybe inthe rcollection
of your lordships that my noble anI learned friend lor. Broug n m, ma speech on the Address, expressed a hopethtfthe matte r of the Chinese war our officisls abroad

I saw the other day in a niewspaper which warmly supports the naoble viscount and assrts his claims to the confidencoe of the country a statement of the opinions to which every man professing to be aLiberal ought toadhere~. "No moan," to use the words of the newspaper in question, "deserving the namneof Liberal, ought to wincee while oate. chised upon each of these subjects :-the ballot, extension of the franchise, especialy Locke Kineg' motion ; the Bank monopoly, church-rates, abolition of purchase In the army, and promotion by merit -a gradaated income-tar." The writer of the article objec, e says, uipon principle to exacting pledges from candidates upon the hustings; but these are the A B C of Libralism, and no mnan ought to hesitate for a sigle momnt while being catechized upont them. I should like to see, for the amusement of the thing, the noble viscont as the head of a Liberal Govern. nient, going through his catechism upont these points. (A lag.) ek the allot, Thexeis not a man in Eng,land who hias pronouxiced himself so strongly against the bilet as the noble viscunt. I need say nothing about Mr. Locke King'g motion, becuue of it we have had recent exporience. The Government ofthe noble viscount have sent the saueeob of the Bank charer toaasolectcoommittnx, but -with a var,' distinct Intimation that the changes they contemplate, if any, Are of the slightest and most trivial kid, certainly, not amouniting to an interference with what is calledl the "Bank monopoly." The noble visounmt has expressed himself quite as strongly with respc to church-rates. I am not suire that he has pledged his Government uponi the abolition of purchase in the army, while I should be surprised to hear
it snnounoeclthat a Governmentimeasure wil be pro oein
the new Parliament to accomplish that object. rt is cer.
tamn that the noble, viscount, as well as every important member of his Admlnistrtion, has preteste againist the possibility of introducing anything like a differentialwhich I suppose is what is maeant by a graduated-income. t" ,I Wil not say that the Government maay not contemplate the inttroduction of measures upon some of these qssestions,butlT am qulte,sure that in the sense in which they are regarded by the newspaper to which I have re. ferred-as tests of liberalism-one and all will most with the determined opposition of the Government so far as they act uponL their own views and principles. (Hear, hear.) I may even venture to say that, should any one of these questions be brought forwarA in the now. arlament by some mnore ardent Liberal than is to be fouLnd on the Treasury benches, the noble viscount, in order to defeat it, will not hesitate to seektbe assistnce of that very Conser. vAtive party which he now acuses of entering into an "siun. principled combination"' to upset his Govemrnment. (Heamr,

NToIsody can be insensible to th6 charms ofhis maniner and conversation, andl his perfect good humour, and everyone must admit the great adroitness with which he mnanage andsteers his course in A popular assembly; but if I am asked whether I have that confidence in the noble viscount which consiss in a firm conviction that, under al l circum stances, he will zmaintain and act upncertain fired political

(Cheers.) My lords, in ever thing which xelates to the amendment and simplifcation of the law-in everytbing 'which relates to the revision of our penal system, to the better disposal of our convicts, to a better provision for rescuing those who are on the verge of crime, to a better provision for assisting and stimulating the voluntary efforts of the country in promoting religious and moral education-in all which tends to tho physical as well as the social and moral purification of that vt mass of contagion which is fermenting in-our greattowns
and throughout thelength and breadthof the land -s;these the noble viscount may depend upon it, if he wllf',ssy enter'upon EO honourable a course, that he has a brght career of usefulness before him, in wFhich he shall nave no more cordial or more earnest coadjutors than the much-abused and vilified Conservative party. (Hear, hear.) But if, yielding to external pressure and sacrificig his own convictions, he gives 'way to the wild cry for rash innovations and insidious encroachments upon the constitution, then, my lords, I trust he will find that Conservative party still sufficiently numerous and sufficiently powerful to stay him in his downward course-to rescue him from himself and from his supporters--to preclude him from inflicting serious miachief upon his country, and from plunging it into anarchy and confusion. (Cheers.) My lords, I am satisfied that it is essential to the best interests of the nation that the Conservative party, whether in office or out of office, should te numerous and powerfuL I say, without the slightest heitation or concealment, I ardently wish-far more than I either hope or expect-that all those -who were once banded together in support of the Conservative opinions to 'which I adhere, would show themselves again united in the same firm phalanx. (Hear, hear.) But, my lords, I say 'With as little hesitation or disguise, that for such a union to take place, or, indeed, any union worth the name, it must be founded upon a concurrence of principle and a concurlence of sentiment, and not founded on that which I believe every honest man would repudiate-namely, a base attempt to nnite those who have no community of convictions for the Purpose of overthrowing the existing Government and formIng a disorganized and heterogeneous Governmenl; in its place. My notions may perbaps be somewhat old-fashioned and contrary to the enlihtenment of the day, but they are the opinions to which I have stedfasty adhered through no inconsiderable period of my life, and I cannot now change them. Such as they have been such they will continue So be to the end of my career, wbatever may bh my political fortunes. I intend to maintain inviolate the great institutions of the country; I intend to support, as far 'as my feeble voice can go, the prerogatives of the Crown, the independence and the hereditary characterof vour lordships' Hlouse, and the rights of the people. (Cheers.) I intend to support the doctrines and ,tbe rights of property of that Established Church of which I have always been an attached member; I desire to see her weak places strengthened and her defects repaired-I desire to see her taking a firmer hold on the affections of the people. But, for iyr art, I never will consent to sce the withdrawal of one single stone frerm the venerated fabric of that church wbich I regard wish filial love and reverence. (Cheers.) Pardon me, my lords, for saying so much upon my own views and feelings. We who sit in this great assembly are not dependent upon the will of any constituency for re-election. We express here our own individual and spontaneously formed opinions. But there is not the less a imoral responsibility resting unon each of ns, and more espe
cil1y upon those of our number who are honoured with the confidence of any portion of their feUow-countrymen, not to shrink at such a time as this from the frank and fearless avowal of their principles-not to veil themselves in studious mystery, bat to declare clearly and maufully the coiuse they are resolved to take under all circumstances and in aU political eventualities. In the assertion of these opinions I may expose myself to obloquy, to calumny, and misrepresentation, as I have done before. Theso things I am able to meet, and I trust I know how to bear them. But no man can say of me during my life, nor, I hope, wiU sany man be able to say, with truth to my memory, that I have ever shrunk from the avowal of my political opinions -that I have ever sunk a principle for the purposo of obtaining an advantage, or that I have ever betrayed the trust reposed in me by those friends who have honoured me with their political confidence. (Loud cheers.)
Earl GRAN'VILLE.-My lords, the noble earl who has just sat down stated with much emphasis on two occasions last week that it was his intention to cad your lordships, attention to the state of pablic affairs on the motion to read this Bill a second time. It appeared, then,'to me that the noble earl was taking a very natural and very legitimate course. Considering this House to be a fitting medium through which to reach the ear of the country, and consider ing, also, the nature of the addresses which have been pat forth by some of his own supporters, I think the noble earl only turned to account the advantages offered by his position in endeavouring to make a statement which might influence the elections, and at the same time form a model for the electioneering speeches about to be delivered to the constituencies. Tho noble earl has addressed us with every advantage which his commanding ability and his consummate oratorical art' afford him, and he has had the amplest opportunity to select every topic and even every single word and phrase that would best suit his purpose. Indulging in jokes and personal allusions at the expense of Her Majesty's Government, he has thought proper to speak of mc and some of my colleagues as "cyphers." Now, I feel no irritation on this subject, and I will tell your lordships why. The noble earl himself thought of making an " appendage" to his Government during his short hold of office. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl declared his vish to have appended to himself one of my present colleagues, Lord Paln erston-no doubt, because he had a notion that that noble lord would have imparted to his Government the tenfold value which a unit gives to a cipher. (Laughter.) But I do not wish to enter into any personal questions of this nature, for, witll the exception of the noble earl's remarks upon an education tax, the whole of his specch was so singularly apologetic and defensive that I think he is afaid that he will not receive that sup. port which we shall receive from both town and country. I believe that he feels he is on the losing side, and I may be excused for feeling thatI am on the winning side. I cannot, therefore, pretend to any magnanimity whatever for abstaining from everything like party bitterness or personal invective in any observations which I.may make with regard to the noble earl or his friends. The first point to which the noble earl alluded was, as might be expected on the second reading of the Income-tax Bill, the financial system of the Government. He regretted, in the first place, that the Government had determined to deal with the income-tax instead of referring it to the nest House of Commons. I will not say one word as to what the country would have thought if Her Majesty's Government, after pledging themselves to give up the war tax, had availed themselves of the exact terms of the Income-tax Act and continued to levy the whole of the war tax; but I think that tho country could have no desire whatever to be saddled with a war tax until the question could have been settled by the next Parliament. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl stated that for years he had been confidently hoping and expecting that the income-tax would be repealed at the end of a certain period of years; but if he would just refresh his mind with what he said a few years ago on the subject of Mr. Gladstone's attempts at prospective legislation in connexion with the SEuccession Daty, he will find that he thon said,
"- hne Succession Duty is not to be imPosed ia order that the income-tax may be. taken off in 1S60." The noblel earl was at that time loth to say when he expectd the income-tax to be taken off. Whethor he is right or wrong in his prophecy, he certainly had not * lways so much confidence and hope about the expiration of that tax in 1860. (Hear hear.) The noble lord then ad. verted to several topics connected with our home policy, and towards the end of his speech he stated that we were going to the ountry without any inte}ligible principles on which they were to decide. Now, before I say one word upon that subject I must be allowed to ask your lordships ,whether there is any peculiar fitness in the noble lord mnakdng this charge against the present Goiernment? (Hear, hear.) The noble earl, in a very eloquent peroration$o his speech, dealt in the greatest po6sible generalities, and I do not:thn~ our lordshipa are able to say what are the (ziincipleibich actuate him, It may be said that an Opposition i; not bound to explain to the country, as a
overnmen t is,. the principles upon 'which it intenda to act. But the nobte earl himsaelf was once at the head of a Government. (A noblelord.-"IHow long t") For a short. lnme, no doubt; btu, in order that that very short timo might be prolonged; that Government delayed the dissolutlon of Parliament, although it was constantly pressed to adopta moro speedy oourse. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl Fdad that*. Parliament Is no*r about to be dissolved when' there is no greit prinoipfe to be contended for; and when Mhe public mind ii tot agitated by any questiols of very
X a
tunied to dissoive Parliaineiit the ~itrSly *sai agitate! by nmost importiant questonc which their Interests wero deeplyconerned, anld in the ettqementof,whloh ens great polticaparty was bo6nn up. The noble earl orver theless sat,calmlyupo?theTreatuqrbench,,surr.unded bj his appendagesand took every opportunityof showingthe greatest temper and- 'atience, and he-exhibitd mnrellous dexterity from night, to' "lght the qus0tions vhich Weputi a wd which we thought we had aright to put, to him as to whether he was going to the country for protection or for free trade. (Cheers.) I really think the noble earl is not exactly the person to bring the accusation against Her Majesty's present Government of not having any defined principles. He alluded to the question of reform, and twitted Her MajeWs Government with having been found in the lobby with the supports of Mr. oe King's motion. I admit that that was an unfortunate contingency (laughter), but I may be permitted to say a word in explanation with regard to that motion. After due deliberation on the part of the Goveremnent as to the principlesofMr.Lock-eKing'sBill,itwas agreed that it should be supported, in order that when it went into committee such modifications might be introduced as would prudently, judiciously, and most usefully extend the county suffrage. It was only subsequently to that decision, and when it was found that the BiU was not draughted in such a shape as to permit the introduction of any such amendments, that it was finally decided that it would only be wasting the time of the House to attempt to -pass a Bill which Her Majesty's Government could not approve. Bat, my lords, if the noble lord wishes to put us in the same boat with him respecting electoral reform, if he imagines that we think with him that our electoral system is perfectly unsusceptible of either renovation or improvement, I tell him that such is not our opinion. (Hear, hear.) With regard to that and other questions Her Majesty's Government pledge themsselves to progressive improvement. The noble lord alluded to the question of education. Upon that subject Her Majestfs Government have very clear views. By the Bil brought in by my noble friend sitting below me, and by that which was brought in by myself (and of which I may be allowed to say that I believe it was the most unexceptionable and would be the most useful that has yet been presented to Parliament), we have shown that we are by no means apathetic upon the question of education. Bat the debates -which toolk place upon these Bills convinced me that it is impossible in the present state of the public mind on that subject to pass a great and useful measure. I believe there are a great many national systems of education which migbt be usefuUly adopted; but even if you could sucoeed in passing any of them through Parliament a very large portion of tho people wouldobject tothem. This, I think, is a statesmanlike view of the matter. We therefore abstain from bringing in any Bills the only effect of which would be to make more dificult the settlement of the question. The noble lord said that ho was prepared to encourage education, but surely he ought to have gone a little further, and to have stated what system of education he is prepared to support. Be ought to have informed us whether it is to the Education Bil which was first introduced into the House of Commons by his Colonial Secretary, for combining religious with secular education, or to the second Bill which that right hon. gentleman introduced, and ahich provides for the separation of religious from secular education, that he gives his sanCtion. He ought to have told us whether ho agrees or disagrees with his President of the Board of Trade, who laid his hands heavily upon that second Bill of his Colonial Secretary, and threw it into the dust. The noble earl condemned Her Majesty's Government for their treatment of Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch, and expressed a hope that the great Conservative party will always be found supporting the existing Government and institutions. Bat I ask whether he regard s as very strong proof of that loyal spirit the attempt of one of his late colleagues to induce the House of Commons to interfere (and I altogether abstain from discussing the rights, merits, or demerits of Sir J. WlTeiU and Colonel Tulloch) with the undoubted prerogative of the Crown to settle what honour should be conferred upon them? (Cheers.) The noble earl also alluded to the foreign policy of the Government, and characterized it as meddling, dictation, and interferenco. Now, the only case ,which could in the slightest degree justify that accusation was that of Nxples. Now, in the first place, one of the ablest, and certainly not the least experienced, members of your lordships' House-a member of the Conservative party, and one by whose eloquence we are all delightedactually reproached us because we have not dictated, meddled, and interfered more with Naple. AU the papers on Naples have been before the House for week& The noble earl complains of their meagreness, and say that he has gone through 45 pages, butcannot make anythmg of them. But when this charge about Naples is brought against the Government, how is it that during the six woelks i which this House bas been passing itstime inalmostcom
rative idlenesI neither the noblelord nor any one of his Irends has brought the question under discussion? HoEw s it that nothmg is heard of the matter until the noble earl nowv comes down to make what I wiU take the liberty of caling an electioneering address? (Hear.) If he had brought forward such a motion I have no doubt that my noble friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would have been able most satisfactorilyto show I hat we have not gone one step beyond what we had a right to do (hear, hear), and that the steps we took in conjunction with the Emperor of the French were taken from a regard to the state of Italy generally, and not merely on account of the internal affairs of Naples. (Hear, hear.) And, my lords, to show how completely that interference has met the approval of other States I may mention that there is not a single Power in Europe, iowever averse itmay be to theprincipie of interference with othernations, that has not followed up the views adopted by France and England on that question. (Hear.) With regard to the West of Europe the noble earl was perfectly silent. I will not repeat what has been said even this session by some of those who follow the leadership of the noble earlas to our relations with the Court of France being less secure than they were, and likely to be endangered. If I did, I could tell the noble earl that the relations between the two Courts wero never on a firmer or securer basis than at the present moment, and I might mention that the very last communi. cation which the Emperor of the French made to our Ambassador at Paris was to express his great satisfaction that in China his own troops would be found once more co. operating with the troops of Her Majesty. (Hear.) With regard to Austria, while I confess that we have no right to claim any particular merit to ourselves for the friendly character of our relations 'with that Powex, yet I may refer to it as an agreeable consideration that at the very time our rdations with her have been strengthening and improving, the Emperor of Austria has been giving encouragement to a more liberal system of government in his Italan dominions. (Hear.) The noble earl said nothing of Russia, and I imagine I may take it for granted that both sides of the House are perfectly satisfied 'with the final arrangement we have made with that great Power; for not one single word has been said against the peace by which wve succeeded, without the hum==iaton of Russ, in gain. in" all the objects for which we contended in the late war. flear,.hear.) I do not know whether your lordships bear In mind that the noble earl, who can make everytbing he wishes to be clear so very clear to those who hsten to him, was exceedingly vague and general, and even obscure in his expressions as ht the Persian war. (Hear.) I partly attributed that to the fact that the noble earl must have remembered a despatch written by the noble earl near him, in which the principle involved in the war was very broadly sanctioned, but perhaps there were some other considerations that led him to avoid the use of any stronger expression than that ofealling the Persian war an unfortu. nate war. In another place-and I am sure I have no wish to point out disagreements between the noble earl and his
pnendages (a laugh)dnthe d tleman who there represents tuenoble earl denounced the war in the strongestterms, and described it as w ar waged on the most contemptible and shameful grounds. He said its only cause was to be found in the "turbulent and aggressive diplomacy" of the Government ;andwe must not forgetthatif nottheMinisters at least some of their adherants have been charged with raising a cry framed on the false notion that the war was connectedwithRussia. (Hear.) MVlords, ontheverylast occasion on which we met, the noble earl (Ellenborough), with that manly and straightforward honesty of purpose for which he is distinguished, declared that the war was a just and necessary war-that even if the engagement did not exist-that had been given by the Shah of Persia we were bound to take measures to prevent, Herat faling into the hands of the Shah, and he added that it would be uncandid not to state to your lordships that the war was counected with tho Russian question, and that he believed the treaty agreed to with Feruk Khan was a mere supplement to the Treaty of Paris at the conclusi.on of the Russian war,.
(Hear, near.) I aim, haowever, in the1, dark as to -what the noble earl (Derby) thinks upon this queston I
have no idea to which of these op, nions he icline
how he reconciles the iarc oneileabile views of theo oble earl (Ellenborough) and of his reprtsentative In an9ther Place. (Hear, hear.)

He called npon his supporters, man of whom held views contrary to those of .the majority in tat House, to vote according to party ties and not follow their personal convictions. Hear, hear.) The iioblo eazl has very naturally alluded to asubject much canvawsed at the. resent moment-vit, the alleged coalition between himseland others, with whomhbe has Dot of late acted, and he quoted-a strong speech of the late Sir B. Peel in favour of coalitions,. ant justifying Its being resorted to. on certain occasons, All this, however, is very much contrary to the -declaration of his repre. sentative in. the other House ef Ptrliimeat, who I remember quoted with-grt effect the words " En.land does not love coalitions." (Hear, hear.) I lately read a statement of the noble eal's, published by a noble friend now on the cross benches, inwhich he gave most excellent reasons why nothing is so dangerous to the characters of public men as to suppose tniat when political parties coalesce such a coalition can, In the slightest deuree, be a steppingstone to power. (" Hear, hear" from LordDerby.) But the noble earl has in his place stated that there is no coalition, no combination, no conoert, and no something else, which I have forgotten, existing on this question (Hear.) Now, when any noblo lord-in this House gives an assu ce-and, still more, the noble lord at the ehoa of the Conservative party-that there is no foundation for any statement that has been made, I would not for one instant venture to doubt the perfect accuracy of that assurance; but when the noble earl challenges us. to stats whether we do or do not believe in the fact of a combination having taken place I am led to state one or t-wo circumstances that would have justified a person in thinking there was something of the sort till the noble earl denied the fact. (Hear.) I would first ask your lordships to consider whether or not it is likely that the noble earl woUld havo liked to have such a coalition In 1851 when the Govertnent was offered to him. (iHear, hear.) lI then stated very truly tbat though his party Possessed great ability and talent, yet thero was a want. fcia} experience among them that prevented their taking power. A yeaw after be did take power along with his party. If I nught use a quotation from the latin Grammar I would sa, "De mortuis nil nisi bonum." (A laugh.) I do not wih to say one word disrespectful of the noble earl's Government; but duming their tenure of office they failed to gaiP tho confidence of two suocessivo Parliaments. (Hear.
In 1855 an opportunity as again given to the noble earl to form a Government, and on that occasion he stated to the Houso the reasons why ho declinedthe task. The noble earl then declared that he had failed in obtaining the assistance of Lord Pahlmerston-this very Lord Palmerston, by the by, in whom the noble earl placed no confidence whatever because of the events of 188 and l850. (Cheers and laughter.) Nevertheless, the noble earl in 10 thought that the only possibility of his conducting the Government rested on the pomsibility of hig obtaining the assdstance of Lord Pa1merston, not in a subordinato position, but as leader of the Commons of Englnd (cheers); and not only that, but, as I am reminded by my noble friend near me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to " meddle," "dictate," and Interfere." (CWeers.)
The Earl of DERBY said the statement was quite unfounded. The position of Foreign Secretary was never offered by him, and never would have been, to the noble lo-rd referred to.
Earl GRAN~VTLE.-I am quite satisfied with the noble earl's explanation, for it appears that he had only that sort of semi-confidence in the noble lord which was sufficient to place in his hands all the powerhe might w as leaderof the.House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) hat as the offer then made, and I am not aware that the party of the noble earl has received any great accession either of strength or talent since that day, and therefore I think it is most natural that the noble earl should wish to obtain the aid of men of high character and eloquence, such as Mr. Gladstone. So far from such a course being objectonable, I think it would be a great advantage to the country if the noble earl could so far strengthen his party that they mnght feel that when in opposition there was a great responsibility weighing on them for their words and actions, inasmuch as they might be called upon to give effect to them when in power. In the very first week of the session the leader of the Opposition and Mr. Gladstone were found in most friendly co-operation, though Mr. Gladstone said he could not help it if the Conservatives came to him and adopted his financial plans, and that he could not refuse their support. But this "monstrous calumny" about combination or co-operation was not entirely confined to the Liberal party. The article which appeared in t'he Press-the noble earl shakes his head. .I know nothing about it, and can say nothing about it. [The Earl of Derby was understood to say that he also know nothmg about it.] I acquit the noble earl of any connexion with that Press; but the Pres

"lord Derby said that he had heard it stated that the amendment moved byv the hon. meomber for West Norfolik o= ted 3in a feeling of dis-a probation at the report which had been circulated of the co~ititween the party which the noble lord was rodto lead an the member for the University of Oxod0 htrpr a oal as.H had never seenMr.Gladstone upon the ubject, nor had ever held the slightest communication with him upon it.'
Then the noble lord is represented to have made a declaration in the most dignified nd emphatic nnner as to dicta. tion from members of his party to him3elf. The Prens then adds,-
"The noble lord said that nro one could be more op posed to coaltionsi effected in defiance of political principl
than himself, but that when members from identity of sen. timent were frequently drawn together to the same lobby it was impossible to, doubt that a bond of political union was established which no party couldrefusetoaclmowlwel

Esarl GRATVILE.-WriI the noble earl say something about the conversations referred to in the Press I The noble earl has contradicted one part of the statementand notthe other, and leaves people to guess whether that which reinains uncontradicted is true or not. (Hear, hear.) With regard to combinations, there might be combination which upon occasions might be honourable to all parties concerned and useful in their tendency, and I must take this opportunity of saying wtith respect to a large portion of members who voted recently against the Government in the other House (not referring now to Conservative members, who had a perfect right to vote on any party question against the Govermnent, but to some of the most distinguished members who adorn the House of Commons) that we,-and I now speak' not only for myself, but for my colleagries and the noble lord at the head of the Governiment,-entirely repudiate the notion that the great portion were actuated by other than the highest and most conscientiout inotives. (Hear, hear.) We think, and the country, I believe, also think-, that they misjudged tho question; but we should regret that honourable men, who gave a disndterested support to the Government during the war and subsequenty,'shouldbe visited with penalties too heavy for a smile vote. (Hear, hear.) Having referred to coalltions, I must observe that there aro some coalitions which are not jied by any temporary agreement in politica opinion.

Sir 'W. CODRINGTON said if the - system of bileting were abolished, it would be extremely, diffcult to provide quartersfor private soldiers on march, for few persons in a

SIR C. TBEVLYAN AND THE, BOARD OF
GENERAL OFFICER.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, in the remarks made b, the hon. rmemberfor Devonshireon Friday last, on the motion he brought forward in going into Committee of Supply, allusion was mado to a passage in the Report of the Board of General O}cers havingIreference to the suppl of foraghto the army. That passge coitAined vvordstothoeffect that the sueringa of theotroopsin the Crimea had mainly been owing to the deficiency of the land transport; that the defieiency of the land transport had mainly been owing to the want of forage; and that the want of forage was attrbutable not to omissions or want of care on the part of officers on the spot, but to tho neglectof the Coruissariat Department of the Treasury to sond out hay from this country. The attention of his noble friandat the head of the &overnment and himself having been directed to this subject, they thought it their duty in the month of August last to drawup a memorndum andcaon Sir C. Trevelyan, Assistant Secrety to the Treasury, whowas mainly charged with the superintendence of the CommissariatDepartment of the Treasury, to giv an'explanation regarding it. Sir C. Trevel anaccordinlprepared apaper, which was submitted to is noble fiend ana himasi- but it ws their opion that the question had practically W)ecn settled, and that no advantage would be derived fromr a revival on their part of the aiscussion; and, therefore, they did not think it necessary to move at an earlier period for its roduchon'. As, however, the question was revived by the hon. member (Mr. Palkl in the late discussion, and. as the conclusion of tho Board of General Officers was altogether disput and denied by Sir U. Trevelyan, inasmuch as he maintained that the want of suppl of forage was not owing to any neglect on the Part of the Treasury at home, san as hispar contained at length the grounds on wisich he maintaiedthat opinon, be (tle Chancellor of the Exchequer) thought it his duty to move for the production of that paper, and to reuest gentlemeni to suspend their judgment on the inatteor tl they had n opportunity of reading and considering the explanation there given. (Hear.) Hecon. fessed, for himself, that he oagre very mduoh with the view talenbythohon. and gallantgentlemanthe member forHuntingdon (General Peel), who expressed an opinion that the suf rings of the army were not so much attriibtable to individual or to any want of system ssto the rapidit 'withL which the expedition was planetd and executed, andto the manner in which the army found itself compclledt after the battle of Inkermann, contrary not only to the expectations of people in this country but to the exeeta-
tions of the moers, to pass the winter in the Crimee (Hear, hear.) The hon. and gallant gentleman stated,correccly, in his opinion, that which was the chief causo of. the sufferigs of the arm and he stated also, with geat truth, Tat al attempts to nix the blme on any prtecular indi-

Sir W. CODRINGTON sid, that tho Board of General Offioers was not appointed to inquire into the goneralsystem of the ,army,. bnit only into evidence Xculpatory- of certain officers who considered their conduct impagned by'the report of tho Commisdoners, and, therefore, as the name of Sir C. Trevelyan was not, mentioned in the report, no evidence-"was taken before the board-respecting his conduct.
The motion Was thon agreed to.
THE LATE NAWAB OF SUBAT.
Sir E. PElRY, in moving for certain correspondence relating tot tno roperty of the late Nawab of Sunrat, said that he was desrou of ealling the attention of the House to the sato of a matter in which it had exhibited great interest. The Hou was aware that a treaty had been entered into between the late Nawab of Surat ind the Eat India Company, by which the Nawab Agreed to suender his principality and the East Lndir. Company agreod to pay him and his family a pension of 15,0001. a-year. Sabseuently, however, uponithe death of thoNawab, the EastIndiaCompanyinterpreted the treayin a manner peculiarly favourable to themselves, and refused to pay the sum of 15,0001. a-year to the heirs of the Na'ab. A committeo of that House had inquired into the matter; and had unauimously decided that the East India Companu was wrong; bt inconsequenceeof some techniality, aBill founded upon the report of the committee, had been thrdwn out inthe otherfHouse of Parliament without any investlgation into the case. In the discussion which took lace last session, tho right hon. entleman the President of -the Board of Control had hell out the goestion that if'the Indian gentleman whosecase he was nowlaying beforethe House applied to the India-house berl terms would be offered to him^; that- sggostion had boen acted upon, and tho East India Company agrd to pay, to this gentleman a pension of 10,000 a-year, and also IO Z.oov, a-year to his two daughters; and thxt offor, althoeuh he did not consider it a liberl one, he hid advisd this Indian
genleenan so accpt in ordei to PUt anoend 'to a rainosus litidation. There was, however,another question connoectd with the prIvateoproperty of the lateoawab. Whten ta sovereign diid the Government goed b fc

V. Sm h)VUaeitherto.diret,theLeio uncilof dia to ropea! thix Act and remitthe parties to their original rights- or, wbich would be better,lilmnelfte introduce a Bill into tiat House which in a few clauses- should affect the same object. Thehon. and learned memberconcluded b
snoving for a copy of correspondence betweern ir Jafer Alt Khan and the Court of Directors, and between the same and the President of the Board of Control, respecting the property of the late Nawab of Surat.
Sir F. KELLY said, that this Act of the Indian Legislature was invalid because it was in contravention of the Act of the Imperial Legislatumre, which provided that no law should be made by that Legislature which in'erfered with any of Her Majesty's prerogatives; and he confidently predlcted that if ever this Actshould be brought under the cognL7ance of a court of justice in England it would be set aside on that ground It would, however, be impossible to bring the validity of that Act under the consideration of such a court without a course of litigation which it was alarming and 'ainul~ to contemplate; and he therefore thought it was ghly desfirable that the Board of Control should recommend the Indian Legislature either to repeal this Act, or so to amend it as to allow an appeal to the Privy Councl. Instead of this subject havinzg been referred to the law officers of the Crown the Lord Chancellor had been consulted upon it. No one could respectthe opinion and decision of the Lord Chancellor morm than he did; but nothing could be more inconsistent with the first princpleg of juatice than to submit such a question to any one without giving to those who were interestd in his decisiops an opportunity of being Aeard. Had the Lord Chancellor heard counsel for a quarter of an hour he must have Pronounced that this Act ws invalid and must be repealed or amended. He therefore ho, that the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Control would either on his own responsibility recommend the Legislature of India to amend this Act so as to give an appeal directly to the Privy Council, or would give this aggrieved gentleman the opportunity of beirg heard, if it were but for half an hour, by some counsel at the bar, who, he was sure, would not fail to satisfy either the right hon. gentleman himself, the law officers of the Crown, or the Lord Chancellor, that this claim was founded onlaw and equity, and that justice never would be done unless somo appeal were allowed.
Mr. hI. CHAMBEBS expressed a wish that the AttorneyGeneral would sate his opinion as to the validity or invalidity of thatelause in theActpassed by the Indian Legislature which abolished the right of appeaL
Mr. V. SMIT3 said, he should have no objection to the production of the correspondence moved for, inasmuch as it would furniash the House with further information, which -was absolutely necessary for the proper discussion of this subject at any future time. The hon. gentleman the member for Devonport had not stated this case correctly nor fairly. The whole case had been submitted to Parliament last sesion in the shape of a Bi which Passed through the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords ; but since that time the East India Company had offered to the gentleman clling himself the Nawab of hsurat a sun of money which he beheved was perfectly satisfactory to him, and which his friends had advised him to accept. The question was now confined to the right of appeal to the Privy Council in respect to the private property. He beleved it had already been decided by the Privy Council that no appeal would lie, but an opinion had been expressed that the Crown might direct a reference. The course which he had pursued in respect to such a reference was the only course open to him. The hon. and lecrned member for Suffolk had found fault with him for not taking the opinion of the law offlcers instead of the Lord Chancellor on this pot ;but he did not know that the law officers would have had the power of hearing counsel, nor could he exactly see how the parties could have appeared before the law officers by counseL Eis hon. and learned friend the AttorneyGeneral had already given an opinion on the su
ject, in his private capacity, and it wpould not have been exoctly dehcate to refer the question to him again as a lawofficer. His predecessor the present First Lord of the Admiralty had refused to direct this reference, and the opinion of four eminent counsel who had been consulted by the East India Company was also against it. The hon gentleman oppoeite misntained that this Act of the Indian Legislature was not valid, but it was the business of hir Jaffir and nt ot of the Board of Control to bring -this point to a decision in a court of justice. As to the want of firmnes and vigour on his part which was comW ed of, he hoped be should always be wanting in that smd of vgour which, by an excessive precipitation to act on -ex,paHre pressure, too frequently committed injustice on absent unrepresented persons. In this case, the property referred to had been already allotted out to the parties interested under the award of Mr. Frere, and if there were now to be an appeal from that award how were the7 to appear ? 'The hon. and learned gentleman opposite mamtained that theseparties had themselves wished for an appeal; but he did not believe that that was the case at the present moment. Mir Jaffir himself had consented to that award; he had been heard before the commissioners, and now that he was dissatisfied with their decision he wished to apset the whole thing. But the other parties to the award had quite as much right to be considered as Mir Jaffir. As at present advied, he saw no reason to -doubt that that award was perfectly just. As to the Act of Legislature, it was a great mistake to think that it could be superseded merely by sending out orders from the Board of ControL On the whole, looking to the opinionD the highest legal authorities in this country, and t6 opliens also expressed by the committee- to' which the Bill of last sesion was referred, he did not think it advisable to take any steps in the' matter. If the hon. and learned gentleman chose in a future mesion to take this question up in another shalie, he (Mr. V. 3mith) believed be would experience the inibsaibility of dealing with an Act which had been sanctioned- .by ParLia nlent, under which an award had been given bl acozietent person, an allotment of the property havg been made under such award to certain individuals, who had no oppor tunity or chance of contesting their rights before the Prvy CounCil except at an expense so enormous as to be utterl ruinous to them.
Sir F. KELLY inquired whether the question of the validity of the Aot of the IndiAn Legislature had ever been submitted to the Lord Chancellor, the counsel to the East Indbin Company, tCe law officers of the Crown, or any other legalauthorities?
Mr. V. SMITH was not aware that it had; but the Act .d been in operation for 10 years.
Mr. LOWE said, the hon. and learned gentleman (Sir F .'Klly) seemed to think the Indian courts had not the same power of declaring this Act illegal or invalid as the courts of England. Upon that point he (Mr. Lowe) differed from the hon. gentleman. Colonial or Indian courts had exactly the same power of declaring an Act of the Legislature un.advised as the highest courts in this kingdom.
Sir E. PERRY denied that any one of his propositions vwas incorrect or unfair. He had brought the case forward because the petitioner had been a suitor for justice for 15 xears. He understood the right hon. gentleman (Mr. V.
th) now to decide absolutelyagant the petitioner's case. If that decision had been given months ago the petitioner would have been enabled to take another course. The At. - torney-Generalhad given anopinionthsttheAct of theIndian
Legisature, which took away from the Queen the right of hearing her subjects in the last resort, was invalid, and he recommended an appeal to the Privy Council- but their lordships had decided that the Act was valid. E[e (Sir E. Perry) believed if a measure on the subject were brought forward next session he would be able to convince the House that the Act in qucatlon was founded upon princples of injustice, and that the House would think it their dut-y to repeal the *Act, and leave all parties to sa eeybfr 3dca tribunaL. ekarmd eoeajdca
The motion was aBreed to, and the House adjourned at 20 minutes past 6 o'c ock.

LONDON, TUESDAY, MARCH 17,1857.
Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock.
On the motion for the second reading of the Incomoetax Bill,
The Earl of DEBBY rose purmuant to notice, to call the attention of their Lordships to the circumrstances under which the present appeal in made to the country. After referring to and regretting the position of financial affairs, which he thought must result in the Government having to meet a deficiency of no less than 6,500,000L in 1858, he said thatnothing but urgent and systematic economy could avail us. On the army and navy but small reductions could be made, but the MiAscllaneous EBtimates had been swelled to a formidable amount by the extravagance of Parliaments, and on those much saving might be effected. The system of economy on which the country must maiily depend was, however, after all, its policy. The Government must substitute a reasonable, conciliatory spirit for a tone of braggadocia and menace-they mur.t prepare not to meddle with the internalm coen.s of any nation, nor to*uase a language of threat and intimidation to Powers which, even though the weakest, were still too. proud to listen to it. NVith rsuch. a sYten, .indeed might the Government keep down the expenditure of the, army; but if, on th& cbntra7y, it adopted tho bther dangerous. prineiple, and if ~tbe discretion or il n-
discretion of offlcials war. to' conUni the-country to a war, tIiey iss givei npi~ onsc; ior all, the idea of. eoumy,- am thenielve& cap-dtie, and prepare to meet all corners at sll
tines.' Referring to the recen -decishn0i come to by the House of Comnoios with regard to 'the afairs of China, Lord DanBy denied -that the Government bad any just cause for complaint at the steps -which had been taiken, or that any party or parties had been actuated b; the motive of embarrassing BEn M rsr's Governnent, SThe -paperswhiuch had been laid before Parliamlent had been given to them solely writh a vievr of enabling them to come to some decision on the question. It was not Parliament which had forced Ministers to take on themselves the responsibility of their xubordinates' conduct; it was Musters who had asumed it voluntarily. Had the Government, when the papers were laid before Parliament, announced then that they intended to do what they had done tince, and that they would send out a Plenipotentiar to inquire into the management of affairs t Canton, little more would have been heard fror Parliament on the subject. But, not doing this, when members moat reluctantly but conscientiouSly voted as they had done on the recent decision of the House of Commons there arose the cry of nnnatural coalition and unfair combination. That charge was a gross calumny, and he renelled it as such. Both himself and the party thit acted with him were guiltless in word and deed of havinct given any just ground for such an imnputation. Hi
Lordship, having given this solemn denial, then entered into a long explanation as to what he believed had been the course taken in the House of Commons by the various political parties which had voted in favour of Mr. COBDEN's motion, and saii that the mere fact of that motion having been brought forward by Mr. COBDEN indisposed some members of the Conservative party to act in support of it at all. Not long ago, when the Government opposed M!r. moex" Krxo'S motion, it only commanded a miserable attendance of 31 followers, of which number 21 were officials. The Conservative party, governed only by their principles. came to Lord PAnuxsro's assistance, placed him in a majority of 13, and saved him from the fate of Acozow, -that of being devoured by his own hounds. That was the conduct of the Conservativex on that occasion, though it was the fashion now to accuse them of coalition and combination. After a brief allusion to the episcopal bench, in which Lord DERBY expressed his regret that the names of some right rev. prelates ahould be sounded by parties in the Church as a proof of sectarian bias, he proceeded to refer to foreign affairs condemning some maritime concessions made by Lord P.sMsEsTow daring the Conferences at Paris, and also most strongly the colurse taken in the Neapolitan affair. He professed his utter ignorance of the policy which the country was to secure by supporting Lord PA13mSETos . He thought it was difficult to recognize that Minister amid the many attributes, all more or less inconsistent with each other, ascribed to him by his various supporters, and he even believed, out of the many portraits, Lord PArmmsTox would have great difficulty in recognizing himself. But that for which Lord DnRBY most condemned him was the ease with which he vielded up his convictions on the least external pressure, giingo as instances the way in which the question of the tea duties had been treated, and his conduct with regard to Sir JoHN M'Nxm and Colonel Tunioc. In conclusion, Lord DnRBY said that, if Lord PAiNmxsTow adhered to a conciliatory policy abroad and acted firmly in resisting uncalled-for innovations at home, he would find no warmer or more consistent supporters than the much abused and vilified Conservative party. But if he pursued a contrary course of action, he hoped and believed that the Conservatives would be strong enough to save him from his own supporters and to check him in his downward course.
Earl GRNvisz said, he thought that Lord DERny had used his position in that House quite legitimately in making the speech to which they bad just listened, for, considering the conduct of some of his supporters, and the nature of the addresses they were putting forth, it seemed quite natural and right that
LodDannY should make a statement which migiht serve as a model and a standard of the political creed of the members of his party. After briefy noticing the financial objections Lord G Rtm
vindicated the home policy of the Government, and reminded their Lordships of the time when Lord Dazy wsas at the head of a Government, and when, notwithstanding the vital questions on which he differed from the rest of the country, he continued to meet their LordshiDs night after night, and fence with them on the question of whether or not he would go to the country for Protection or Free Trade. He explained the course purtued by the Government with re-gard to Sir JoNw M'NzmL and Colonel TuLIOCH, and adverted to the skill with which Lord DZRBY had avoided noticing the many favourable aspects which the foreign relations of this country now presented, and how close and intimate was the understanding which existed with the Emperor of the FknwoH, with Austria, and other great Powers of Europe. For the same reasons Lord DERBy had but little dwelt upon the Persian war, which had so signally maintained the honour and interests of this country. Referring to the vote on the Chinese question, Lord GRAR-ILLE expressed his belief in the solemn pledge given by Lord DZRBY, but at the same time went at some length into the quesion of the statements made by the Press newvspaper with reference to a combination between Mr. GIADSTONE and the Conservative party, with a view to account for the generally expressed opinion as to a combinationof partieshaving attempted to drive Government from office. He vindicated the Episcopal Bench from the charge oflatitudinarianism, whichhadbeenhiated against some members of it, and regretted that Lord DanPy should have made an almost personal attack upon Lord PAREnSTow. The best Answer he could make to that attack was to refer for a moment to Lord DaRBY'S anxietv to secure the official services of Lord PALMERsToN when he was seeking to form an Administration in 1855. With regard to their having no policy on which to appeal to the country, he thought the question of whether the electors were willing to support the present Government was sufficient, and he believed that its result would be triumphant to Iord PALasxTon's Administration.
The Earl of M.ALmsnuny briefly recapitulated some of the arguments used by Lord DEBY, and added. his denial to what had been' already stated with regard to an asserted coalition or combination of parties to bring about the adverre vote in the House of Commons.
The Earl of HARDwrcxz also expresseed his deep indignation at the general tone in which Lord Danny's explanation had been noticed by Lord G.Awvmx. It was, he thought, neither courteous, nor even honourable, so to act in the face of Lord DEBBY's solemn denial of any coalition with any party.
Earl GBAvrTT briefly explained, and their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons,
The Speaker's Retirement Bill, the Exchequerbills Bill, and the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill were read a second time, after an explanation by the CaBcxraon of the EXO xcuzn, in reply to Sir H. Wrovonnv, with referenceo to the lastmentioned Bill._
The Mutiny Bill snd the Mlarine Mutiny Bill passed tbrough committee.
The CRANbELc0ox of the ExcHsQuR moved for the production of an explanation of Sir C. TxxvELyAr, respecting a passage in the report of General Officers appointed to inguire into certain satements in the report of Sir Jon MNsnrL and Colonel TuEocOH in consequence, he said, of certain remarks made in the course of the debate upon Mr. P e's motion on Friday.
After some remarks by Colonel NoBT1T, MIr. M. Cmanans, and General CODRINGTOKz, the motion was ac'reed to.
SiMA PanRY moved for a copy of correspondence between Mi JAF= ALT KasKl ad the Court of Directors, and between the same and-the President of the Board of Control, respecting the property of the late Nawab of SuvAT, and asked W. SmT
what were the intentions of Government relating thereto. lie pointed out certain modes of proceeding by which, in his opinion, justice might be done to tho party claimant in the ease.
Sir-F. KExLL urged that the Act passe by the Indian Legislature in this matter had set aside the prerogative of the Crown, and was therefore void m law.

Lord DERBY'S address last night to the ladies
lord DERnY's address last night to the ladies in the galery of the House of Lords and the electors of England is of a piece with the whole of his Lordship's brilliant but visionary career. It is an exercie of oratorical ingenuity framed to make the greatest ponsible amount of I political, financial, and sentimental display without compromising the orator on any one practical point. Excepting. some of those safe generalities which are as common to all Peers and Members of Parliament as " the noble Lord " and " the hon. " member," Lord DzxBY gives us no clue to any policy or measures of his own. So his speech is like a schoolboy declamation against a thesis, in which from first to laat the poor boy flutters about in a cloud of his own making, and never once rests his foot on any fact or principle of this waking world; or, when he does, is not for a moment credited with one atom of seriousness. His Lordship is very anxious about the finance of the country. Whichever way be views it he is equally distressed and solicitous. First he is indignant that, under the pretence of abandoning the War Ninepence, the CH"cERou of the ExOHEQuEn still keeps on the twopence. From this mental perturbation he passes to one of an opposite cbaracter,-the very small surplus we are to expect this year. Hardly recovered from the fear of present insolvency, his Lordship looks forward to the year 1860, and feels a gloomy foreboding that we shall not get rid of the Income-tax. This leads him to the expenditure, which Lord DEBBY thinks excessive and alarming, though his alarm, like that of most people, unfortunately comes when the biU is presented, not when the articles are ordered. Neither Lord DERBY nor his friends were alarmed at the cost of the County Police being thrown on the nation; nor at the Scotch Survey, nor at the Education Vote, nor at a good many other votes, because then alarm would have been a practical sensation, and would have involved an actual move one way or other. He is alarmed for the past, and without plan for the future. He cannot even suggest how any considerable saving is to be effected in our Civil and Mscellaneous, much less in our Naval and Military Estimates, and only hopes tbat we shall not go on making matters worse, which we certainly thall do if Lord DPBBY and the Conservatives are as careless on the point as they have hitherto been.
Butfor our NavalandMilitaryExpenditure. This, his Lordship says, depends on our foreign policy. If it is to be respectful to the rights of foreign nations-if ;t is to avoid menace and braggadocio, and to show a friendly spirit to other Governments-then, he says, reduce your naval and military establishments, and have a full treasury. There is much virtue in an " if " but if Lord DEBBy would positively say wherein our foreign polcy has erred, and what we ought to do, he might thereby do the State some real service, and also present a handle for controversy. It is in vain that we sift whole bushels of declamation for one solitaryword of soundadvice which we couldfeelsure Lord Dmny would have given and acted upon had he been at the head of HEn MAESsT's Government. The nearest approach to one is his suggestion that on Mr. CoBDns's bringing forward his motion for the censure on Sir Jonsm Bownmc and the other authorities in the neighbourhood of Canton Government ought not to have attempted a justification. This, he ingeniously says, invited the censure it was designed to meet, but only as a man invites burglars into his house by firing at them with a revolver as they are forcing their way through his windows. Government ought, Lord DzRBY says, to have expressed their regret that, with the best intentions, a hasty step had been taken by the British authorities at Canton, and, though they could not immediately suspend operations, his Lordship frankly admits, they ought to have promised to send out a Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to take the proper steps to put an end to hostilities. Lord DEBBY then demands an admission that Sir JoHw Bownwo and his colleagues had done wrong. In the first place, Government were not disposed to make it, for though, in a course of action extending over weeks, andiincludingalong correspondence and a series of operations, it is quite impossible but that a distant critic may find good fault with this word or that step, they could not say that in the main, and on the whole, Sir Jon>- Bownmo. and his colleagues had done wrong, or so evidently wrong as to cal for censure. Then Lord DERBY does not inform us how England would have stood if Government, acting against its convictions, or in advance of them, had expressed a regret that Sir JoHN BownRZ-o had done wrong, and so vitiated and repudiated all that had been done by our representatives from first to last at Canton. This is an affair of the waking world, and a very serious one. What were we bound to do, if we admitted the responsibility of all thebloodshed and destruction that have taken place? We have notthis question toanswer. Butthenexttimeagreat Conservative gets up in Parliament, or elsewhere, and tells England that she is in the wrong, and Commissioner Yx in the right, we trust he will have the grace to add a practical corollary explaining what she ought to do. It certainly strikes us that on this supposition there is much that we ought to do, serious as it might be to our purse, and derogatory to our character. This, however, is precisely what Lord DEBBy does not explain to uns.
As Lord DEnY is the chief of his party, absolute over them, whether in the Commons or in the lords, out of doors as well a" indoors, it will be some satisfaction to the people of England to possess in his speech a picture of what they must expect should he and they have the misfortune to find him in a majority. They are to expect a succession of ingenious views upon everything and everybody, very good for debate; and a succession of expedients good for nothing, not even for keeping up the show of a policy. Lord PALMERSTON'S foreign policy can be descnibed, even by a foe; it can be called " turbulent and aggressive;" it can be called " braggadocio and menace." 'Whatever it be called, the present result is peace with aU the world, except with a distant and barbaric country, in which Lord PAuMrMoW, at least, is not the cause of the mischief. On the
other hand, what is Lord Dzrnys foreign poliCy ?I Who can answer that question ? When he was Premier the other day, he selected for his Chancellor of the' Exchequer a man who had devotedc himself to exposing the interior of the Neapolitan prisons, and appealing to Europe in behalf of the political victims buried there. Was it Lord DanB's policy to prosecute or suppress this appeal, to encourage or to stifle the sympathies of his friend and colleague t Had he any policy in the matter except the convenience of the hour? lord DanBY' scrutinizes the election cries which ho has seen or Imaginedc on the opposite *ide. Whatever the -claims of the Parsiran to reform or to retrenchmnent, can Lord Dzssr himself advance a better claiim to either ? Or i5 a man no reformer because lhe demurs to a particular:project at a paticular time t Nothing 'wril &atisOtyIordJD)zBY-neither frinnnessnorconceesion, neitheithechivalrousdefence of ERs M.4,jsrY's servants on a remote station and
in great difiulties, nor yet s timely. concession to the w ishosof Parliasaent in behalf of iU-requited public' officers, or on anyother point. What is Loid Dxnn'iS own policyw i' emergencies of this sort ? Is he yielding or obstinat ? He haL been obstiuate to the ast in defence of class-interests, Corii LAws, and other such rubbish; yielding oxi all those ecclesiastical questiois whieh it might be presumed from the tone of bis speech last night he had so much at heart. But there is not a point to which he alluded last might in which he could not Sit in thesame Cabinietwith Lord PAnsxsTox,sosimilar has been hiscareer,withthe exception of one or two fatal and now admitted errors, and so great has been his pliancy wherever any advantage was to be obtainea by bending to the storm. There could not be a stronger proof of the want of any real and reasonable difrerence between hira and the Panms= than the circumstances of the late Ministerial defeat. Lord DERBV and the right hon. gentlernan with whom he admitgthat he had frequent conversations, but of course no coalition, put Lord PAeRsrox in a minority, not for what he had done, but for what he neither did, nor k;new of a day before they knew of it.
Lora DERBy is fortunate in having an opponent whom ho can abuse for what he does. The complnnent is not easily returned, for his Lordship presents little else than a dense mist of words, a flimsy vapour of profession, and a dark smoke of vituperation. lHe easily attackls that which is definite and substantial, which admits of being described, and which can be charged with inconaistencies. Lord DERny's inconsistency is that of practical weakness; the inconsistency, for example, of telling iEp MAJTSTY one day he cannot pretend to form a Government without Lord PAnimRSTOo, and telling Parliament another day, not long after, that the man so indispensable to his own political success was utterly without principle, opinion, or anything good whatever. It is evident, too, from the very speech before us that Lord DERBY is in no haste to consolidate his views and his party into a more definite system. There is not a syllable in his speech to tell us how he and his friends mean to govern the country, if they should unexpectedly find thenseIves in power. No; "Man never is, but always willbe blest." Lord DxnBy is content to spend his life on the threshold of power, with a considerable following, with frequent opportunities for splendid declamation, with credulous admirers, and not very angry opponents. A position of this sort suits his cultivated taste, his ample fortune, his habits of life, his social comfort, and his health of body and mind, much more than the terrible responsibilities of office, the dread necessity of doing as well as talling, of biding reallts as well as criticism, of being read in history as well as in newspaper columns. Possibly there are some among Lord DEnnys humbler followers who dream of something more, and whose aspirations are not quite fulfilled in a war of words. They feel that if it is to be all speechifying neither they nor their country will be much the better for it. We are heartily sorry for them. But if they cboose the allegiance of a clever declaimer, who feeds them with words, with words they must be satisfied, If tbeywant deeds, they must look out for another master.
The announcements appearing in our successive
The announcements appearing in our successive impressions of Saturday and yesterday, to the effect that a new Plenipotentiary had been appointed to proceed to Pekin, and that the last statesman intrusted with such a raission had just departed this life, might seem almost to imply that diplomatic intercourse with China was transacted once only in a generation, and that we were now about to repeat the enterprise which produced so little results forty years since. The coincidence, however, is merely superficial, for in no points do the two occasions resemble each other. Since the Embassy of Lord ABuaST to the Celestial Empire our whole relations with that Power have undergone a change, and are now dated almost entirely from the Treaty of 1842. That settlement, ineffective in some respects as it now appears, represented little less than a revolution in the relative positions of tho two countries, and the Court of Pekin, instead of dismissing our Ambassador unheard on assuimptions of its own, was fain to confess itself vanquished, to open its ports, and to pay a heavy tribute to the conqueror. We no longer address the Chinese Government with the views formerly entertained, but can estimate accurately its claims, its resources, and its power, as compared with our own.
It is surprising in what a small compass of facts, if not of time, our political relations with this singular empire will be found to lie. When Lord MIACAx-EY, the first Envoy ever despatched from Great Britain to Pekin, departed on his novel mission in 1792, a British Factory had been maintained at Canton for more than a century, and it was to regulate, and, if possible, improve, the terms on which our countrymen inhabited the Chinese territory that the Embassy was sent. The analogy between tho circumstances of that period and the present as regards the local politics of Canton might soem extraordinary if it were not recollected that the same motives of action would continue to operate upon two parties so situated as ourselves and the Cantonese. In the history of Lord MA&Nwze's Embassy we read of the jealousy and fierceness of the city population, of the rudeness of the English, chafing under the contumely to which they were subjected, of the probable ignorance of the Supreme Government on the point, of the advantage of enlightening it by direct communication, and of the attempts of the Canton authorities to prevent a stop so menacing to their own provincial power. Even the criginal appearance of our countrymen in the Canton River is so singularly characteristic both of ourselves and the Chinese, that, with a little change of phraseology and nomeixclature, it might bo related as an occurrence of October last. It was in the 17th century when the captains of three English merchantmen, having acquired from the Portuguese of Macao the information that there was a great river and a goodly city to which no barbarian could have accem, determined, with audacious unconcern, to brave tho authority of the. most populous empire in the world, and deliberately sailed, with all the English vessels they could collect, up the waterx of Canton. Surrounded by "jounckes," and interrogated by the astounded Mandarins, they declared, sincerely enough, that they wanted only liberty of trade, and received in return fair words, with the privilege of anchoring in the river. Presently, however, the Chinese, conceiving suspicions of their purpose, " put 46 of cast-iron ordnance into the " fort lying close to the brink of the river, each " piece between 6 cwt. and 7 cwt., and well pro" portioned; and after the end of four days, "'having, as they thought, sufficiently fortified ''.themselves, they Aischarged divers shot, though " without hurt, upon one of the barges pasing "by them to find out a convenient watering-place. " Herewith the wholefleet,beinginstantlyincensed, "did on the sudden. display their bloody ensigbs, "and, weighing their anchors,fell up with the flood, acnd berthed themselves before the castle, whence " came ma.ny shot, yet not any that touched N so
"much as hull or rope ;- whereupon, not being "able to endure their: bravadaos any longer, esoh "ahip began to play fuiriously upon them with "its broadsides, and after two or three hours}
"perceiving their cowardlyiin te
"were landed with about 100 I eh, rwich:gh
'occaioned them with great distractions n tly "to abandon the castle and fly, the boate- czews
in the meantime,without let, entering the-mune, "and displaying His M&jnsTs colours of GreAt "Britain upon the walls." Many of the combats of later days have been little more than reproductions of this first encounter of the English and the Chinese.
T The consquences, however, of this eharacteristic ifitroduction 'poved rather inconvenient. Unlike other nations, who had paved the way for their merchants by subtle and craftymissionaries, armed with such credentials as might tend to impose reTpect, the English appeared on"the scene as reckless, independent adventurers, an'da their attitude, more daring, but lees dignified,> tfhan that of other Europeans, inTpired the Ciese with mingled sentiments of dread and dislike. For more than a century did this situation of affairs continue, until the conquest of Bengal, the capture of the Philippinesx, and the extraordinary increase of our commerce at Canton esdted the attention of the Court of Pekin, and impressed its rulers with a more adequate idea of the position of Great Britain. To confirm these impresions, and at the same time to adopt, as it were, the selement at Canton, and cover it by the protection .ncT recognitioh of the parent State, Lord MAoaXnmRa was despatched to the Chinese capital_d his Embassy was foilowed 24 years afterwards-y that of Lord AaRnsr, whose decease we yesterday announced. From that time to 1839 affairs proceeded in much the same fashion-with inherent weakness, but arrogant assumption, on the part of the.Chinlese, with a disadvantageous position but conscious power on the part of the B3ritish. At length caime a positive rupture and an actual war between China and one of the great Powers of Europe, the result of which, as we need hardly repeat, was the total defeat of the Asiatics, the ransom of Canton, and the opening of the Celestial Empire to the merchants of the West on more liberal terms that before.
That these conditions have been but imperfectly fulfilled the reader is well aware, and, in fact, the reception given to Lord AMHERST at Pekin is no bad typo of the general treatment accorded to Europeans in China. He was refused admission to the Celestial Court, excopt on terms with which it would have been degrading to coniply, and it is only on terms which, though. we do comply with them, are at once humiliating and oppressive, thatwe maintainan intercourse enriching the whole Chinese nation. " I sympathize," said Mr. COBDEN himself in introducing his recent resolutions, "I sympathize withthe position of theChinese " merchants residing at Cauton. It is not a plea" sant tbing to live on the borders of a river, and " not to have a distance of two miles for exercise." Certainly it is not, and the unpleasantness is felt still more sensibly when we remember that our residence there is infinitely beneficial to the Chinese themselves, and that but a few years ago we held to ransom this very city from which, in defiance of treaty engagements, we are still insolently excluded. It is easy to declahn about the rights and independence of Chinamen, but when a far stronger nation demands, for the purposes of commerce alone, such facilities of intercourse as would remove the marks of debasement and obviate the chances of quarrel; we do not see how the requisition is to be described as unjust or unreasonable.
Looking comprehensively over tUle course of our relations with China, we may say that the only proceeding which realy affected our position there was the war of 1839, and that the only impediment to the realization of the advantages then obtained lies in the spirit and disposition either of the Cantonese or their Governors. Hlow little permanent effect was produced by Lord MACARTNE'S mission may be inferred from the failure of Lord A='msrs a few years afterwards. Very different, however, was the result of those hostilities by which the Court of Pekin learnt that a " barbarian" Government many thousand miles off had the power to coerce it into reason on its own territories, and to make it pay for the lesson. We do not believe that even at this moment the moral of the event would have been lost if the Court of Pekin were still in possession of its ordinary authority, and had proper cognizance of affairs at Canton. It is scarcely, indeed, to be imagined tnat a Government constitutionally timorous, with the recolection stil fresh of so decisive a defeat, should venture deliberately upon renewed hostilities with its formidable adversary for the sake of resisting demands which it had already conceded, We sincerely trust that Lord Ewnf may find the means of reviving recent impressions of our power without any repetition of the severities which accompanied them, and that he may be able to enforce his arguments rather by the terrors of the old war than the results of a new one. Otur demands are stil for reasonable treatment, and nothing more. We desire no conquests in China, -in fact, it would be preposterous to think of establishing ourselves on territory already too small for its population. We ask only for such conditions as will relieve from stigma and inconvenience an intercourse as advantageous to the Chinese as it is to us, and in this request there is surely nothing contrary to fairness or justice.
The first sight of an American Railway map,
The first sight of an American Railway map, to use a vulgarism, " quite takes one aback." An impression is produced rather akin to what we receive when a friend whom we have not cast eyes on for fifteen or twenty years comes across us, and reminds us forcibly of the fact " how old we are " getting." Here ig a part of the world which we have scarcely left off picturing to ourselves as aboriginal and fresh from the great act of Creation completely intersected by railways. Omitting all the intermediate stages between Chaos and Brads1kaw, it has taklen a violent leap into time, and from the very first seized hold of the latest results of civilization. A network of 26,000 miles of railway now covers the United States. This has been accomplished principally by Irish labour, and it is unnecessary to say that the cost of construction bas been very small, compared with that in this country. The single article of the difference in the value of land would, of course, make an enormous difference. The cost of construction per mile on the New York and Massachusetts Railways has been 10,0001. to ] 2,0001., as compared with 35,0001. on British railways. WMe quote the very intereating Report on the Railways of the United States by Captaiin DoUGLAs GALTON.
The cheapness of land has been one great cause, as we have just said, of this sudden and wonderful creation, more particularly as grants of land are often made, especiilly in the Western States. Let us take the Illinois Central Railway as an e:ample of this method of railway-making. Congress granted to the State of Illinois 2,595,00 acres. The vacant lands, in alternate sect 'ns,;within six miles of the road were conveyed by &irect teWfns in the grant, and, in lieu of *uch portions as had been preriously sold, selections qere authorized to' be made between six and 165 iles on each side of the road. The- Company'raised 20,000,000 dollatrsby mortgage upon the 4curity of this land, reserving, however, 260,000 acrestowards the annuala payment of the int6rest. At the same tune they caZllin 25 per cctt. of a capital stoclCkof Il',000,0O dollars. This pays for theIllinoisCentral Railway, which is therefore, in fact; given to the Company, with the exception of the quarter 'hicb.
£hoe ake from -their own stook. The State only charges 7 per cent, on the profits of the raflway s a compensation for its gift of land, and thus a railway of 250 miles, which forms the backbone -of Illinois, and connects Cairo with Dubuque, is built at a cost to the company of 4,500,000 ldolars.
Butt the most remarkable feature which this 3Report brings out is the energy and impetus with 'rhich the Americans have rushed in lmedias res at -once in the construction of their railrways. This -explains the rapidity and the small cost of this *vast work more than the cheapness of land or the grants of laud.. There are some persons who can-mot begin to work till they have a perfect tool. ,They are fidgety and uncomfortable witbout it
ihey wait-and wait and delay operations indefinitely I -i their tool is nicely ground, polished, and ahaied, and a convenient handle put to it. 'There are others who won't wait, but take 1he first tool they can get and work with it. A bad tool is worse than a good one, buLt in -the meantime they are doing so much work ,while the others are doing nothings but only wait-ing. It depends, of course, on what the departmnent of work is which of these two methods is the ibest. An epic poem requires the very best tools =and waiting; a speech at the hustings or in Parliament must be made with -whatever tool comes to ihand-i. c., witb the best kind of expression we -can panKmon at the moment. Some persons, how-ever, cannot bring themselves to speak till they have hit on the very bestword. The late Archbishop of 'm0AN.TFmunY was so fastidious in his choice of 'words, that he used to keep his audience painfuny -waiting till he had tried one word after another to see how it would fit, and, as this process took place oLsce or twice in every sentence, the constant search ,for perfection was hardly repaid by the tardy dis-covery. In matters of "time and tide," and -over which that great power to which one of tthe seven wise men consecrated the result of a life's wisdom, " Opportunity, " presides, it seldom :answers to wait very long for your machinery. In -war, for instance, you cannot.
The object for which railways are wanted in America is in one very important respect different from that in tlhis country; they are wanted not -simply as railways, but as roads,not only to quicken -communication between different towns, but to -open a way into the heart of large spaces of terrivtory, and to cairy off their produce. The railway is the carrier there. Railroads, as Captain GALToN -informs us, are cheaper than roads; there would not be funds forbhcoming for making even stolerable roads over the vast prairies of the West; but the railway comes before the road in this -extraordinary world of inversions; it is the -aboriginal road of the West, performing the -very first function which a new country wants-that of opening it to human labouir, and affording -a channel by which the results of that labour ,can make their way to a purchaser. "When i' first opened, three years ago," says Cap-tain GArTor of the Illinois Central Railway, "the " station-houses were almost the only habita" tions on the line; now there is a large vilage at <' each station, surrounded by vast tracts of culti" vated ground. When I passed along the line <" last autuman sacks of corn covered every avail"able spot round the stations, and the means of
the company were scarcely adequate to removing " them." With boundless tracts of land, then, lying idle and waiting to be used-land which will give -an enormous return to cultivation, it is obviously ;not the interest of the American to delay Ihis railway til he can make one with the best curves and the most even rails. He -cannot afford to wait for a chef-d'om&vre of -engineering; no, every minute is lost that this land lieg idle, and therefore he just lays down a -railway good enouglh to take him into the heart of -this profitable region, and set him down there with ,Vlough and pa e, and a channel of conveyance for -the produc, of his farm. He bends the railway to his temporary object, and makes it serve the purpose he wants at the time he wants-i.e., now. He dashes at his end, and does not mind sharp *curves and inclined planes. This is making the most of the instrument in his own case, and wielding it -most victoriously and effectively. The Baltimore -and Ohio Railway, as first made, avoided an -expensive tunnel by " a series of zigzags, ascend"ing over a hill by a gradient of 1 in I8 at its "steepest part, each zigzag terminating in a short -" level space, so that the train was run up one 4' zigzag on to this level space, and then backed up " the next zigzag, and so on." This eccentric ex,Ipedient was superseded by a tunnel afterwards, but the American would not wait for perfection before he had his railway in the first instance. We wish -our Indian authorities would take a hint from American expedition. They go on waiting for perfect engineering, and doing nothing till they -can do everything as it is done in this country. The Americans would have covered India with 'railways before now. The mode of raising funds -for the construction of railways by meqans of grants .oi land is, perhaps, a useful hint to our Australian -authorities.
It would, however, be doing injustice to the American railways to omit the great conveni-ences and good accommodation which they afford, -notwithstanding the haste of their construction. Indeed, it is one of the most remarkable characteristics of the system how it combines roughness and expedition in the construction of the railway with convenience and refinement in the railway -furniture and carriages, even greater in many respects than those we have in this country. The average American is perhaps more particular about indoor comfort even than the average Englishman; he carpets his churches, and complains of our cold zooms. The railways humour these tastes, and the carpets, the cushions, the chairs with backs, that can be put either way, the room for moving about, the lights, and the warm-air pipes, put all except our first-olass carriages to shame. The ingenious contnivance on the New York and Erie Railway, of a fannel which conveys air down into a chamber, where it is-purified by spray forced up from jets below, and thence makes its way through the car, is a specimen of American railway indulgence to zsummer travellers. The slanting windows and the screens of tarred canvass for throwing off the -dust show the sam e consideration, while the use
Iof a bell instead of a whistle on leaving stations
proves a regard for the human ear at which we lave not arrived in this country.
There is a little matter which we would fain
There is a little matter which we would fain zrge upon the consideration of our readers even amid the din of electioneering strife. It may not 'be quite forgotten that some weeks since, when there was held in Smithfield a meeting of distressed !abourers and artisans, we pointed to Emigra-tion as the true source of relief. The question is so completely one of common sense that we can 4careely conceive the existence of two opinions iupO6ithesubject. Suppose that these islands, in jplace:J-of a population of 30,000,000, or thereabouts, contained but a population of 15,000,000 -the national resources, the fertility of the soil, and -the mnanufacturing capacities remaining the sameRt is quite cle*r that whatever inconvenience might be the result that inconvenienee would not be --elt by the labouring population. The real cause of- the miseit )wbich fell upon certain sections of the labourijg classes during the winter which is now .paasng away resulted from the pre ponderance of hands over work. This state7 of things was far from universal. Pauperism is abho-
li.tely on the decrease intlie aOregate, although it is perfectly true that in cerW n places the itence cf great destitution im, nifortunately, not to be denied. The causes- A)f this destitution wera transitory, but-there'will always be transitory causes of destitutionconSined to particular areas and localities. The pointthen, is to provide a harbour of refuge for those persons who may from time to time b throvn into such straits. We say that in our various colonies, but more especially in Au'stralia and the Cauadas, that harbour of refuge is to be found. Let us illustrate this position by an example. Suppose at the present moment all that section of the island which lies to the north of the Scottish Border Line were waste and. uncultivated, and suppose that any artisans or labourers who might happen to be thrown out of employment could in twentyfour hours betake themselves and transport their families into this Caledonian sanctuary, should we hear much more about the distresses of the labouring classes? Now, the Canadas and Australia are such a Scotland as we are supposing for the purposes of the argument. The only substantial difference lies in the length of the voyage, which is a mere point of detail. It really matters very little whether an emigrant be twenty-four hours on a railroad or ten days in a ship. The cost of the sea voyage is undoubtedly greater, but so that this can be got over there is an end of all argument. Toronto will do just as well as Stirling, and Melbourne as Inverness, as far as the future fortunes of the emigrant are concerned. The one. thing necessary is to build the bridge and set the fashion. When our struggling fellow-countrymen become aware of the fact that a door of escape is opened to then, and that Emigration " answers," we feel well assured that they wiMl find means, in one way or another, to make good their flight. What we, who have wealth, intelligence, and the habit of affairs upon our side, have to do is to organize in the most complete and economical manner the system of Emigration. When the machine is once in gear and at work it will not need much help from without to keep it in active operation.
Now, a Society of noblemen and gentlemen have established a certain fund, to which they have given the name of the " Wellington Emigration " Fund," from the fact that the present Duke of WELLwGTON heads the subscription list with a
donation of 1,0001. Messr. LABoucnERE, SIDNEY
HERBEPET, and T.ooeAs BARING, the Lo" MAYoR, Lord STr.NzEY, and other men of kindly nature and approved character, talke an active share in the proceedings of the Association. This Association it is our desire to recommend in the strongest terms to the favourable consideration of the public. The working men of the metropolis say that, although "they are compelled to ask for an " entirely free passage to the colonies, as far as "concerns present payment by emigrants, they " adopt as a prominent and distinct condition of " such a boon that the whole cost of their convey"ance shall be repaid by all persons so assisted "within a certain time after their arrival." This condition is one which we doubt not will be satisfied. There vill not be many bad debts to write off the books of the Wellington Emigration Fund. We recommend the Association to turn their attention most earnestly to a sound organization of their transport service. Let them not only contribute the passage-money of the few; let them also give such an impulse to the traffic that the many may pass from point to point at the lowest possible cost, and without danger of crimps and accidents by the way. In default of the interference of Government, which cannot be hoped for in such a matter, we recommend the Wellington Emiggration Fund to the favour of the public.

HONGKOXG, JAW. 30.
As we were writing our last advices, on.the 15th inst., there was a report that an attempt had been made to poison a large portion of the community, arsenic having been mixed with the bread at one of the principal bakeries of the plaee. This proved to be the case, and several hundred people suffered from eating the bread, but we are happy to add we have heard of no fatal consequences, though many are still suffering from the effects. We believe it is agreed among the medical men that the consequences were not fatal owing to the large quantity of arsenic used, which acted generally as a violent emetic. The head man of the bakery, known asAllum, left per steamer for Macao early in the morning of the day the occurrence took place. There was some delay on the part of Government in sending after him, but a foreign gentleman, a sufferer from the atrocious attempt, chartered a steamer, and succeeded in capturing Allum before he got on shore at Macao. He was brought back here, and his trial, with that of several of the men who were employed on the premises, comes on at the sessions now sitting.
The man, from the first, has asserted his innocence, but it is a significant fact that the Chinese steward who was on board the small river steamer Thistle, when she was captured and the foreigners murdered, and whose evidence was most conflicting at the inquest, was the person employed to see to the delivery of the bread that morning.
After this act of the Chinese there was a strong feeling in favour of martial law being established; and the propriety of such a course was recommended to Sir John Bowing by those on whom we have to depend for the security of the place, and who have not an over strong force at their disposal. His Excellency, however, was disinclined to have any interference with his authority.
The Chinese New Year's-day, the 26th instant, passed over quietly, but apprehensions are entertained that some mischief is intended against Coe place.
We hear of a large number of boats and junks being collected in the neighbourhood for the purpose of an attack. The force in the harbour is, no doubt, sufficient to repel any Chinese fleet, but we have a very small number of men to meet an attack on and. One regiment is not sufficient for the service of this place in an emergency like the present.
The community is on the alert, and, with the precautionary measures that are in force, it is to be hoped any meditated attack will be prevented.
An application made to the Governor-General of India for a regiment to be sent on here has, we understand, been refused.
The French ship3 are anchored at the head of the Bay. Her Majesty's ship Calcatta is at the West. The United States ship Levant is also iDi the harbour. Small steamers chartered by the Government move about the harbour at night.
En consequence of a report brought in by the American steamer Lily, that a number of junkis and snake boats were off Lintin, and had attempted to intercept her, the 'United States steamer San Jacinto has gone out to look after them.
The Want of a steamer to cruise constantly in the neighbourhc-od is now much felt, there being none available for tlie service at present.
Commissiouer Yeh has addressed Dr. Parker, the TTnited. States' M;nister, asking him why he has not order'ed American subjects and American ships of war away from Hongkong, to be clear of the present t;oubles. We havenot heard of Dr. Parker's reply.
There was a report from Shanghai that an Imperia Conmmissioner from Pekin was expected to come down here rshortly to arrange matters at Canton. This is premature. A Tartar General, with about 40 attendants, came down from Shanghai in the American steamer Antelope, and went on at once to Canton avid Macao, passing through this place unknown to the authorities.
At Canton Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, owing to the demands made upon him for the security of this place, has been oblied to withdraw the forces from the Garden, the Dutch Folly, and Birds' Nest Fort, and opposite the foreign ground. He has taken up as a position the Teetotum Fort, in the Macso passage. It is to be hoped he wi be able to maintain this post and keep open the river,which the Chinese are making great efforts to block up. They have now a very large fleet of war junks and boats congregated in the river, and which are daily increasing.
Before the Dutch Folly was evacuated the city was bombarded from it.
On our forces leaving the Garden the church and boat-house were at once set fire to by the Chinese.
On the 12th inst., as Her Majesty's steamer Sampson wax on her w&y up the river, she fell In with a large fleet of junks, which she engaged for some time, but could not foellow them up the creeks The steamer was hulled by numerous shot, and the Chinese pilot, who was in the British service throughout the last war, was killed.
The junks which engaged the Sampson were seen the other day up the creeks when the Encounter was coming down, but, although the steamer anchored off the place, they would not come out. The want of boats of light draught of water is a great drawback. Admiral Seymour is at present here, waiting the arrival of the mail. It is reported that the Viceroys, under whose jurisdiction are the four Consular ports to the northward have received despatches from Pekin to the effect that they are not to interfere with the quarrel at Canton, and so far quietness prevails along the coast.
Advices of the 26th of November from England were received here per steamer Shanghai on the 17th inst. We cannot yet announce the arrival of the 10th of December mail. Now that the PeninsuLar and Oriental Company are free from demands on the part of Government for stearmers, we maight expect the terms of the contract to be more punctaally carried out. The xteamer Bombay leaves for Galle and Bombay to-day, andu it is expected she will be in time at Galle to meet the semi-monthly steamer from Calcutta.

Tea-The market was excitad; a few settlements reported at an advance of 2 to 3 taels. The settlementsof silk had been 2,000 bales, at an advance of $10 per picul.

The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent:-
" BOMBAY, FZm. 16.
" All was well with the force at Buashire up to the 23d of January, the date of the latest letters that have reached us. Secure within their intrenchsments, blut somewhat weary of inaction, the troops only d6sired that the oft-repeated rumours of an impending attack upon their lines might prove true. The army was in good health still, with the exception of the 2d Europeans, who continued weakly. The climate was variable, heat alternating with cold hard winds, accompanied by clouds of dust. A little rain had fallen, and was gratefully welcomed. Supplies were plentiful, and the temper of the people from whom they were obtained is described as favourable to the invaders. The fear, however, that we may not be able to insure them a continued and lasting protection prevents an open declaration in our favour. General Ontrama had not yet arrived, but was anxiously expected.
"Here the intelligence brought by the last mail from England of the easy and satisfactory settlement of the difficulties with Russia bas given rise to a very general impression that the Persian quarrel will soon be brought to a close by the-submision of theenemy.. Without assistance from his powerful neighbour, the Shah, it is urged, not only cannot maintain a protracted atruggle, but must give in at once; and that such assistance will not at present be. forthcomingrecent events inE3urope seem to establish beyond a doubt. But-to turn from speculations to certainties, from the conjectures of the dinner-table and the gossip of the bazaar to the rheds of the arsenal and the hammers of the dockyard-we find ample proof that the Government sees no present reason to suspend operations.' A second mountain train battery is ready for shipment, complete in | every particular; and large quantities of spare ammunition of all kinds are daily leaving the gun
wharf. The Light Battalion has sailed for Bilahire I direct. The 23d has before this been embarked at Porebunder, and is on ita way up. The officers named for service in the Irregular Cavalry corps, under Colonel Jacob, are fast reporting themselves to their chlef at KErachee. At that station, too, has arrived from Jacobabad, in splendid order and 800 strong, the first of the Colonel'stwo famouk regiments of Scinde 3orse, unsurpassed by any light cavalry in the world. The 14th Light Dragoons, 300 sabres of the gouthern Mabratta and 100 more of the Poonah Horse, are lying at Kiakee and Poonab, awaiting the final orders' to march, which wil be transmitted to them when the transports now rapidly fitting are completely ready for their reception.
" On the 28th of January Dost Mahomed broke up his eamp at Jnmrood, and, bidding farewell to the English Commissioner, departed for CabuL Of the nature and conditions of the assistance to be rendered to the Ameer by the British Government nothing is yet known, It is natural that ramours should exist of an intended advance from Peshawar, and the Delhi Gdoe gives as the latest of its kind a report that an ary of 15,000 men is immediately to be formed on the North-rest frontier. On the other hand, we are asured that all the Dost requims from us is money, not men; that, well supplIed-with the former, he wi supply himself with the latter, and that he mistrusts the effect upon his countrymen of the presence of armed Europeans in any considerable numbers. Hlowever, an English political mission is once more to be seen in Affghanistan. Three officers have by this tirne, in all probability, left Peshawur for Candahar, to ascertain the position of affairs at that capital, the prospect of an attack by the Persians, and the movements of the enemy generally upon the great road leading from Herat to Southern Affghanistan, by Furrah and Ghirisk. The men selected for this delicate and dangerous mission are Major Lunsden, Lieutenant Lumsden, and Dr. Cor. T.he first named is Commandant of the Corps of Guides on the Affghan frontier; the second, his brother, has been serving on the ataff of the Peshawur division in the Quartermaster-Gene .ars department; the third is favourably known to the frontier tribes in his capacity of a ekilful medical man. Each of the three indeed, I telieve, posseses an intimate acquaintance with the language and habits of the people they are about to vit, and each enjoys a high character for tact and resolution. There appears to be no doubt that they will-find the Persians approaching Candahar. The inhabitants themselves were, we are told, fullly expectingan attack, deeming the force stationed by THyder Khan at Ghirisk to cheek the advance of the enemy quite insufficient for the. purpose. *The Dost is said to.have enijoyed his visit, and all went welltillthe lastfew daysof his-stiy, when anunfortunate event occurred to mar the pleant quiet

" By the arrival of a native vessel from the coast of Zanzibar we learn the death of the Imaum of lIuseat. The deceased Prince had governed his extensive but scattered dominions inAfrica andArabia since 1807. It was Iiis ambition and wish to be on friendly terms with the English, whom he greatly admired, and to wvhose Sovereign he presented, it may be remembered, a 74-gun ship, to which the name of Imaun' was given. Ris son and successor has long been known to us as Governor of Muscat, his father residing at Zanzibar.

"The annual report of the Directors of the Bank Of Bombay has just been published, accompanied by a statement showing a gradual and steady increase in the business and profits of the bank. A notable feature of this statement is the small proportion which the losses of the bank since its foundation in 1841 bear to the accommodation afforded in tho shape of discount during the same period. While the aggregate amount of biUls discounted is upwards of 22,000,000i., the total losses amount to only 1,6001. An honourable testimony this to the steady and ssFe character of the trade of the place no leas than to its magnitude.
The bank rates for discount continue at 8 per cent, on Government bills, and I0 per cent. on commercial paper.

Oar money-market daring the past fortnight has become very much easier than could have been anticipated, and money can be had in the Bazaar on easier terms than at the banks; but as the season advances we must look for higher rates to prevail, especially as Calcutta bank rates ofinterest not rule from 12 to 14 per cent.

The improvement in our import-market noticed in onr last has, we are glado to say, been well maintained. Under the influence of larger orders from the npper and north-

In consequence of the Indian regiments being nowr recruited from those corps on the British establishuAent which are abovo their required strength, the number of troops now attached to the Proviional Battalion at Chatham is greater than has been the case for several years, the toted strength of the battalion exceeding 4,000 men of all ranks, exclusive of officers. In order to provlde barrack accommodation for this large number of troops it has beexn found necesary to quarter 500 men, belonging to the Indian. dep6ts, in the huts adjoining Brompton Barracks, and 50) men are also stationed at the Casemate Barracks with the Medical Staff Corps. The depOts at Chatham will give about 5,000 troops to the Indian regiments during the approaching season.
Artificers are employed from 5 in the morning until 10 at night in Portsmouth dockyard, to equip the gunboat squadron for China enumerated yesterday as fitting out at; Portsmouth, and also the troopships and frigate Transit,.

The Dublin journals of this day are filled with accounts of the effects of the tremendous storm, whicli, commencing on Friday night, only subsided yesterday evening. Satnders's Newsltter says:-
"The London mail due on Saturday last at 10 o'clock *.m., did not reach Kingstown until after 4 o'clock, p.m., in consequence of the train having been thrown ofthe line in the tunnel at Bangor, which camne in contact with & agon that had been driven there by the storm, and

In the 8afet Harbour at Holyhead there were two steamers and nearly 20Q sail of all descriptions of vessels ridin safely, which had taken retuge there.

The direc

PARIS, MARck 15, 6 rX. N
The new undertakings projected by Ruaal& i the Eaut form the subject of several private Ietterg recently received from St. Petersburg. It would occupy too much space to transcribe them at length,
even if they did not contain matters irrelevaut, ornot directly relating, to her present views. I content myself, therefore, with presenting a summary of these projects, premising that they are given from a Russian point of view.
These letters concur in stating that the Government of St. Petersburg is at this momnent taking measures for a decisive campaign against the mountain population of the Caucasus, in the hope of finishing, once for all, with the independent tribes which have kept her power in check and arrested the accomplishment of her designs in Asia. With that object great preparations are on foot, and orders have been sent to the troops who were echeloned on the shores of the Caspiana and the banks of the Araxes, to act in case intervention should be required in Persia. They are estimated at not less than 200,000 men. But, independently of that force, Russia is said to have secured the active cooperation of several of tne chiefs of tribes who recognize her authority. In Russian Daghestan, to the north and south, the Eianus of Derbend, Tarkon, Kuba, Chirvan, Karabagh, and others less known, are expected to furnish two bodies of horse and one of infantry. The chiefs have already received Russian decorations and high rank in the Rusian army. They have, moreover, been promised a large recompense for faithful service, indemnities in land or money, and the succession to their Governments in favour of their sonS. By these means it is hoped that a general rising of the tribes that yield obedience to Schamyl will be prevented or paralyzed. Similar means of seduction have been employed throughout the Caucasu, to secure the co-operation of some and the neutrality of others, and to sow dissension among those who are the avowed enemies of Russia, for to this great object the views of Russia have been directed for months past.
The force which is thus about to take the field is divided into five corps, which are to operate simultaneously on the north line, on that of the Black Sea, on the centre, on the line of the Caspian, and on the south. General Prince Bariatinski is the person who is still designed for the command in chief, and with him will be associated a Staff composed of offlcers selected from among the ablest and most experienced of the Russian army. It is even expected that one of the Czar's brothers will proceed to the scene of operations.
The Emperor is more than ever anxious to bring to a conclusion the disastrous war of the Caucasus, which, by the sword or by disease, consumes annually a third of the Russian army, and which has now lasted for 50 years. Besides the glory which such a conquest would reflect on his reign, he regards it as amatter of the greatest public interest. Alexander II. made his first military essay in the Caucasus, and he is qualified to estimate the importance of a position wvhich would at the same time command Turkey, Persia, and Central Asia, with the trade of those rich countries. His predecessors were equally well aware of the value of these possessions, but circumstances prevented their applying their efforts exclusively to them. Their attention was absorbed by the affaira of Europe; those of Asia were comparatively neglected. Circumstances have changed, and Europe will for some time to come be less cared for than Asia. The most buoyant hopes of the commercial and political destiny of these countries are indulged in, but the Czar is well aware of the impossibility of their realization until Russia becomes the umdisputed mistress of the Caucasian isthmus-until her movements shall be unobstructed and the disposal of all her resources perfectly free. The rebellious tribes must be brought under her subjection and pacified, and the freedom of her commanications secured, before she can hope to found anything stable or enduring. The security she is anxious to make general does not exist even in the districts which are least hostile to her, among the Osoetas and the Kabandines who dwell at the base and on the centre of the great Caucasian chain. The route from Mozdok to Tiflis, -the only one, I believe, which Russia possesses by land to Georgia-though dotted throughout its whole length with redoubts and military posts, is ever dangerous. Whosoever ventures on it without a Epecial recommendation from a friend can hardly hope that he will ever find his way back. The Government are generally obliged to furnish, twice a-week, a convov of infantry, with cannon and detachments of Cossacks, to escort the traveller and insure the arrival of deapatches. On the slopes of the long chain which stretches from Anapa to Bakou, from the Euxine to the Caspian, the danger is still greater. In the forts which extend from Anapa to the Ingour the Russian garrisons are blockaded by land, and the soldiers cannot go to any distance from them without the risk of being made prisoners or put to death. The Abkhans, the Circassians, or rather, Tcherkess, are ever on the alert.' They occupy the gorges and the passes, and, when least expected, make inroads on the Russian territory to plunder and lay waste; and towards the Caspian the Lezghis still rush down from the mountains and cary off, almost from the gates of Tifiis, men and cattle. Russia has employed every resource-force, gentleness, influence, and gold-to change a state of things so hurtful to her interests. Nothing has been found effectual against the wild and indomitable tribes that oppose her. She has sometimes obtained a respite or a truce. The forays may be at certain intervals less frequent, but they have never ceased for any long period. The system of warfare practised by Russia consisted, as is well known, in hemming in the mountaineers with forts and armed lines and shutting them up among their snowy peaks and narrow gorges. This plan has become, however, ruinously expensive, and these forts, necessarily detached, are sometimes distant from each 'other, leaving many passages open, particularly when forests intervene. These forests were found to be an almost insurmountable obstacle. The Russians several times tried to burn them, using tar and other inflammable materials, but the fire went out of itself. Divisions of infantry were next armed with axes to cut down the massive trees, but this did not avail.
It is admitted that General Yermoloff has been the only governor who appeared thoroughly to understand the nature of the war in the Caucasus, and who employed the necessary vigour and energy in his administration. Several generals have been in command since his retirement-Paakiewitsch, RosenkGollovin, Neidhart, Woronzoff, &c. But Russiahasgainedlittleby these changes, and the conquest of the country is hardly nowmore advanced that it was 20 years ago.
The xesults of the campaign about to open will, of course, depend on the manner in which it is conducted. It is certain that if Russia, with pre. parations on so large a scale, does not obtain important advantages, the tribes will become more confident and more audacious than ever, and that the new Transcaucasian provinces will be endangered, and her design of carrying a route for her trade through Georgia and of making Tiflis a new PaImyra must be indefinitely postponed.
THUs, occupying as it does a central pos,ition nearly 100 leag,ues from the Black Sea and the Caspian, on the banks of the Kour, may aspire to become the important thoroughfare for the overland
trade Uetween Asia and Europe7 as in the time of Justinian. But from these high hopes to their realization there is a great internal. The first condition is fullIand entire security and that condition is impossible until the complete subjifgation of the Caucasus. The question of rapid communicat-on is said to be of more easy attainment. The opening of new routes also occupies the Russian authorities. The first project is the construction of a railroad from Tiflis to SaIjain on the Caspian, at the mouth of the Kour to be connected by meahs of steamtnavigation with YtechWhidisser, orko2kaklah, another-ort on the Caspian belonging to Persia, in the proivne of Mazanderan; and Persia, on its side, isto open a line fromu that port to Teheran, .9nly -Sleagues to> the south. If these designu be Q~ecduted; and with the line from Moscow to Tsoo4eia terminated, St. Petersburg and the iBl! will then be iu direct communication with 'e'ria. In. the meantime the Russian Governmnent e doing their utmostto turn tothe Tifli

I muit zay a iwor about th'e prepiarations niade by theimountain-tribea for war. -Thenewsof bthi Russianuarmaments appears to have excited teat agitation amiong them, The chiefs who-inhabib the northern slope, or .rather the whole vaUey of Kuban, have met together in order to decide on a plan of common defence. Several conferences have been held, and the necessity of a single authoritv; with a view to th-e unity of operations, has been admitted. To obviate jealousies among the chiefs it was agreed to confer on a strager the chief command; and a Hungarian. who had taken an active part in the wars of his own country, and who has mince become a Mussulman, was selected. HIe accepted the colmnand, which was offered to him by a deputation, and some time since left Constantinople 'with over 400 Poles who are to form the nucleus of a Polish legion, under the immediate ordera of one of their own countmen. Two English vemsels were freighted by him-a brig and a steamer -and, besides the expeditionary corps, carried out two field batteries, some thouands of Mini6 rifles, rockets, and ammunition, purchased, it is maid, in England, and secretly sent to the Bosphorus. They set sail during the night. xL Boutinieff, however, discovered the affair, and. the Russian steamer, the Pruth, received orders to set sail immediately, and follow as closely as possible m the track of the English vessels. What occurred subsequently I am not aware.
In his twofold character of prophet and the most ancient of the Caucasian chiefs, Schamyl has seen with displeasure the selection of a stranger for the chief comnand. On the other hand, negotiations have been again opened with him; the Russian Government have offered a magnificent principality with the -reversion to his sonsand their descendants, on condition of his recognizng the suzerainty of the Czar, and engaging in his ovn name, sndin that of his successors, to keep the mountain tris in strict obedience to Russa.
The following article from the Pays, the Government paper, corroborates wvhat I have said relative to the arangement concluded in Paris between the iBritish and French Governments to act together in the Chinese Seas:
"The Chinese affair, examined in a proper point of view, presents two phases perfecty distinct-the past and the future. The first belongs to history; the second lnvolves the interests of various Powers, whose commerce is now seriously damaged, and who psrceive the necessity for putting an end to the present state of things. It is to do so that an honoiable understanding has lately been come to between Frnce and Eng' land. The latter Power sends numerous reinforcements to Admiral Seymour, who will have an important maritimo force under his command. France, on her part, bas maintained the squadron of Admiral Ga6rin in the Chinme Sea3 with a view to future operations, and this squadron is to unite with the naval divnsion commanded by Rear-Admiral Rigault de Genouilly. Thus our marino will be on a respectable footing. The two Admirals will have at their disposal steam frigates, corvettes, and gun. boats, so valuable for an attack on the coast and for asending rivers. The maritime force of the two nations so employed will necessarily bring the Chinese authorities to terms which wil put an end to the war, and improve the former state of affairs. At the same time that the British Government is sending military reinforcements to China, it Sends special commissioners charged with opening fresh negotiations, which will have the greater chance of sucOessas the Chinee will see that, from the imposlig forces brought against them, it will not be to their advantAge to continua the war."
It is said that after the departure of Feruk Khan from Paris the Persian Government will be represented in France by an Envoy Extraorainary, Minister Plenipotentiary. A similar representative will be appointed to the Court of St. James.
M. de Bourboulon, French Charge d'Affaires to the Court of China, left by the last Indian mail, which sailed from Mlarseilles on the 12th inst. He carries with him instructions to Admirals Gu6rin and Rigault de Genouilly,who command the French fleets in the Chinese Seas to combine in future their operations with those of the British forces, conformably to the arrangement concluded in Paris between Lord Cowley and the French Government.
Count Walewski had a conference yesterday wvith Mf. de Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Minister, to whom he communicated verbally a note in very firm language, which XL de fatzfeld transmitted by telegraph to his Court.

AUSTRIA.

VIENNA, M-ircn 13.
The citizens of Vienna were in a very ill humour last nightZ andthe reason why they were so &this:The Mumcipal Council and magistracy of the city, with the burgomaster at their head, yesterday stationed themselves at the so called outer " BurgThor," with the ini_ntion of welcoming their Majesties on their arrival in the capitaL Although a piercing north-east wind was blowing, the " fathers of the city" had donned dress woats, it being contrary to Austrian etiquette to appear before Royalty in paletots and such-like ignoble garments. .It is related that the b-rgomaster had prepared a speech for the festive occasion, but if so, no opportunity of delivering it was afforded him, for the h6rses, which drew the close carriage in which their Majesties sat passed through the outer palace-gate at
full speed. The members of the deputation' state that as the Imperial vehicle drove past them no sign whatever of recognition was given by the Emperor. His Majesty had expressed a wish to be allowed to return to his residence inpeace, but the Municipal Council thought itself bound in duty to display its loyalty by standing shivering in the open air for an hour or two. The Oeste"reichische Correspondens speaks of the " enthusiasm" displayed by the " great crowd" which had assembled to see their Majesties as they drove into the city from the railroad terminus, but there was neither the one nor the other. The weather was so very unfavourable that very few persons were collected either at the outer " Burg-Thor" or- at the " Bellevue," and there was little or no acclama-
tion.
The first proof which the Emperor will give to the Hungarians of his desire to content therm will be to mnake them a present of the splendid suspension-bridge between Peath and Buda. At preset the interest of the 700,0001. which the bridge cost is paid by means of a small tac imposed on the persons who cross it.
As you maust be aware, the Conferences 'elative to a Customs union between Austria and the other German States opened at Berlin on the 5th. The public is not likely to learn much of what passes while the Conference is assembled, but the final result will assuredly be that Austria and Germany wil in 1860 form one great "ZQllverein."

The few words esed to intr6dduce.this short despatch to the notice. of the reader4 state that i.s text willshow how little tuth there is in te aridui
leaions putfbrward inthe press as totfib KirLg havingenterea into any definite undertaking in eOnnelion with the liberatin' of the pricners. The official.Treussis Correepmdenz alo informs ith readers of what all the world knetr already-that a Conference of the Representatives of the Four Powers partien t the London Protocol on ths Neuchdtel matter took place in Paris on the 5th inst which was followed by another on the 7th, at whic the Representative of Prussia was also prasOnt. It goes on to say
"This -rrangement was perfectly conformable to the views which His Majesty's Government had pointed out from the very beginninz in aUl their diplomatic expression x as guiding them. His Majesty the King has already declsred himself prepared as soon asthe preliminary conditioa of the liberation of the Royalist prisoners should be fulfillel to deliberate with the other great P owers of Europe as to the future relations of NeuchAtel, whenever these latter rhould haye come to an understanding as to the propsais -hich they might feel themselves caned upon in the interes: of Europe to make to Pressi. It follows fom this that Prussia was desirous of joining ini the conferences only wheA thls mutual understanding of the Four Po;wers was arrivod at, and eould not do so before. This is how it, ha;also taken place, and the deliberations will now take thei, course. The various Governments, however, and their Representatives have agreed to maintain secrecy on the sutject until their close."
THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(FROX OUR OWN coREsrPoNDzir.)
NAPLES, lAxcIE 7.
It is a pleasing commentary on the amnesty lately granted, andwhichiscommuonlcalved the "Thieves' Amnnesty," that a few days sace the Cardinal gave the police authorities a list of 80 priests who were to be expelled from the city. The police, acting in the same spirit, made ap their list and submitted it to the Cardinal, as I am informed; but, not approving, probably, this interference of the laity in things divine, lisa Eminence immedately suspended all orders.
The Giornake of Friday night has the following decree:-"The moral and religious care of the penal bagni for high and ordinary punishments on this side the Pharo is intrusted to the Company of Jesur,.Workrooms are tobeestablished in the bagni of high punishment similar to those which exist in other prisons. Such arts will be introduced as correspond bestwith the condition and intelligence of the condemned A remuneration for work will be given proportioned to the labour and good conduct of the prisoners. There will be established a savings-bank in each prison." It is not an insignificant sign of the times that the Jesuits are again creeping into power and favour. Padre Cenm I believe it was who said, "When the Neapolitan Government feels itself strong it drives us away-in its necessity it recalls us." However that may be, the Jesuits arenow again installedinfavour, and their influence is daily becoming more widely extended.
The Minister of Grace and Justice has lately intimated to the Procurators-General of the various courts in Naples that, having been informed by the ag,entsof the poEice that the advocates, notaries, and other frequenters of the courts talk and conspire (one and the same thinxg in Naples), he is desirou3 that the discussions should not be protracted more than necessary; that decisions should be arrived at as soon as possible, and that on this bein, done the courts should be immediately ,closed. To such a head has suspicion grown. To cap this order to tha Procurators-General may bh mentioned an order of the day to the army, forbidding or checking all intercourse with paesani or cilans. Society is therefore in a highly ap. proved state of demoralization, and checks, prohibitions, commissions of surveillance, and all the other measures of an imbecile despotism are daily and hourly tending to the same end.
Oxford Examinations.
OXFOBD EX4MXAMA-TOAVS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Wbile the authoritiesr of Oxford ae reformingtheir examinations, I would call their attention to one evil which seems, if possible, on the increase, and which I think your readers will agree with me ought to be removed-I mepathe employment of college tutors and private tutors to examine and clas their own pupils in the schools.
A candidate who has, it may be, half, it may even be more than half, the questions lo by those with wiom he has been resding the subjects perhaps up to the very day of the examination has at once a mnost unfair advantage over other candidates. This is particularly the case in regard to such subjects as philoeophy and history, about vhich men's Tiews and styles of examination differ very widely.
But, besides this, there Is the direct influenco of inter. ested persons on the result. Even if they abstain from actually voting (and I believe the private tutors do not always abstain) they can press and do press the claims of their pupils on their colleagaes; and men always regard it as an advantage to have their tutor in the schools.
The rule of the University that no one shall examine a member of his own college jird voce distinctly confesse,
but does not obviate the evll. First, it does not reach the private tutors, whose interest in the matter is the mo t direct; and, secondly, the vivd roce, which was almo t everything when the role was made, is now almost nothing.
I sincerely believe that if perfect fairness under sucha system were possible anywhere, it wouald be possible at O.xford; but I do not believe that it is possible anywhere.
I may be told that it would be difficult to find examine, s who were not college tutors or private tutors. I answer with submission, that the difficulty of finding competent and fair examiners can scarcely be pleaded by the wealthiest University in the world.
Let the University take the appointment of examiners 1nto her own hands, instead of allowing it to wander about from college to college as a perqtisit tothoVice-Chanoellor and Proctors; and then let her appoint first-rate men, pnd pay them properly for devoting themselves to the worlk
Whenl we consider howr much men, poor men especially, take on their classes we shall all agree that they ought to be awarded in a manner perfectly abovec suspicion.

TO THE EDITOR OF T1HE TIMEvS.
Sir,-It was with stonisient I read in the report of that part of Lord Palmerston's speech on the 3P.Neill ard Tulloch debate in the House of Commons on the evening of the 12th inst., that the excellent condition of the milltaly hospitals in the Crimea was attributable to the advice and suggestiois of Dr. Sutherland and the other Sanitary Com. missioners.
His Iordship has been misinformed in this matter, and I owe it to my own reputation and position distinctly to stat3 that neither Dr. Sutherland nor any other member of the Sanitary Commission had anything whatever to do with either the organization or mansgement of the military hcs. pitals in the Crinea, and I believe them all to be gentlemen of too much honour and probity to take credit for anything of the kind.
. What valuable information they ma have furnished to the Government at home I am unable to sa.T; but so far as their suggestions on sanitary matters in the Criimea ara concerneed it was admitted by thearielves that 'aImos: everything they could think of wAs either'in actual opers. tion, or had been recommended by the Medical Department of the army before their arrival but, asthey were invest d by Government with greater power than was conceded to {he principal medical officer of the army, they thought they might assist in getting useful measures carried out.,
I should have allowed this report to remain .nnotlced, a I have done many ofhers, did it not proceed from-'an authc. rity which stamps It in public estimation as a denial, on' the part of Government,'of all credit, due either to myaelf or the medical departmenk, for months of anxiety, toll, and privation inth Crimeea; and itis disheartening to medical officerm to and. that the meed of praise which is sO justly their due has bn gieven to ci'iianarawho iived after the dif'iculties of the army had oeen' urm6unted.

The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourso this evening were 7Mf. for money, and 71f. 25c, for the end of the month, showng a fractional improvement.
The letters from Paris describe an inereased demand for money in consequence of the halfnmonthly liquidation, most of the speculator3 bein'
lndispoed to closetheirpurchases. Theaugmented tax on shares, although it 'will be very heavy on those which are at a high premium, seems not to be beyond the anticipations which had been entertained. To holders of shares at par yielding 5 per cent. per annum it 'will be equal to an incomle-tax: of 3 per cent.
The amount of gold withdrawn from the Bank to-day for -exportation 'was 35,0001. The whole of the gold brought by tbe. Admiral from Australia willbe sent away, with the exception of 40,000 aovereigns.
ITer Majwetys ship Electra has arrived from Port Phillip with gold valued at 6000l. The Wiliam Money, - from Melbourne, and the Vocalist, from Sydney, are also reported, but their quantity of gold, if any, remains to be ascertained,
The commercial letters from India received today are not unfavourable as regards the demand for Emropean goods, but the pressure for money at Calcutta, which has caused the rate of discount to advance to 14 per cent., is calculated to give an additional stimulus to the shipment of silver from this country. At Bombay the trnsactions inimpori had been on a satisfactory scale, and would-have been larger but for the firmness of holders, while at Calcutta an active general demand had prevailed both for Manchester ms.nufactures and metals. The anticipations regarding the new Govermment Five per Cent. Loan have been realized, scacely any persons being disposed to subscribe to it.
The accounts of tl,e manufacturing trade of the country for the past week present no material change. At Manchester the tendency has been towards firmness, owing to the Indian advices. In the Birmingham iron-market there has been less general activity, although quotations have been maintained, and no reduction is anticipated for the ensuing quarter. The general manufactares of the town continue to be-affected by the high prices of tin and copper. At Nottingham there has been a diminished home demantd for lace, but the foreign orders have been large. The woollen districts and thelrish linen-markets have beenwithout animation.
Messr Fustana and Co., of Liverpool, and Caluta, Brothers, of Manchester, who recently supended, have submitted a statement of their affairs, showing assets valued at 73,3851. to meet debts for 72,4581., and propose to pay 20s. in the pound, by five half-yearly instalments.of 4s. each.
The dollars brought by the last West India steamer have been sold at 60*d., being an advance of id. on the price realized for those by the preceding packet.
At a meeting of the London and Paris Bank held to-day, Mr. G. A. Hamilton presiding, a resolution proposed by the directors for affirming the dirsolution of the company was strongly opposed, on the ground that a committee of investigation should previously be appointed. A violent discussion took place on the statement of accounts circulated among the sbareholders, and described in The Times of this morning, the expenditure generallybeing considered excessive. It was stated by the chairman that the balance will allow a return of 13s. or 14s. per share, in addition to the sum of 71. (exclusive of calls re turned) on those shares on which the calls were not fully paid, and of 18s. 8d. (5s.-8d. beingfor interest) on those on which the cals were fully paid. The directors wished to make the final payment immediately, but some contingent claims render it necessary to leave an amount available, and hence it is proposed to distrinbute 10s. shortly, and the further fraction at a distant date. The shareholders, however, were not satisfied with the balance-sheet. The sum of 4,0001. charged to account of the directors was challenged, and also the law expenses connected with the charter. It was explained that the directors, although they have taken credit for this sum, have not applied it to their own use, but that, having aswmed the responsibility of 2,000 unallotted shares beyond the amount required for their qualification, they have thought fit to charge the company with the proportion of the preliminary expenses incurred on that account. At the time they took those shares to support the undertaking an agreement was made that if any profit should accrue the bank was to receive it. Having worked for nearly two years without an allowance, they considered themselves justified in the course they had pursued. This avowal elicited great disapprobation, and the appointment of a commttee was strongly urged. After a further protracted debate, an amendment for the nomination of a committee of five was carried by a majority of 30 to 12, the latter number including the votes of the directors Apoll'was then demanded, and the board having possesion of a ]arge number of proxiesthe result wasreversed, the orginal motion for affirming the dissolution being carried by a large majority. During the discussion it transpired that a neg'otiation had been opened with the Royal British Bank shortly before it failure for a transfer of its business, and that it had been abandoned in consequence of the directors of that establishment having refused to allow their accounts to be verified by a public accountant.
The general business of the port of London during te past'week'was moderately active. Tho total number of ships entered inward was 143, being 21 more than in the previous week.

T he arrivals of wheat last week were moderate, but flour was plentiful, as well as all spring corn, exoepting peas. The imports were-2,730 quarters of whea, 1,800 quarters of barley, 102 quarters of oats, 1,500 quarters of beau,, 690 quarters of maize, and 2,031 sacks of flour.
The receipts of wheat were-In English, 5,636 qurters. foreign (chiefly from the Mediterranean), 7,919 quarter3 The morning's supply from Kent wAs short, but from Essex fair, with samples somowhat improved In condition, yet sales were very limited for the best qudlities, and rather in buyers' ,favour, all rough parcels being pased by. Thero was a retail trade in fine foreign at unaltered rates.
Of English flour there were 17,493 sclks, of forign 131 sacks 6,429 barel Both Norfolks and American were rather cheaper, rates of the former ranging 40s. to 41s. per sack Town-made samples as last week
The quantity of English barley was 3,049 quarters, the foreign 20,68 quarters, mostly low grindingsort3. Fine buley, being stil in limited quantity, supported its vlue
secondary sorts were dull, and light grinding descriptions neglected.
Malt found a fair trade at full quotations.
The arzival of oats consisted of 31,857 quarters; of theso 893 were Scotch, I,729 English 13,058 foreign, and 16,177 frem Ireland. The rates of 5I descriptions wero reduced 6a. per quarter, and, Irish being more plentiful, in some
instances, were Is. down. I
Of beans there were 4,457 quarters foreign, and 923 guarters English. ess, almost wholly native, were only 314 quarters. The large supply of foreiga beans made the trade heavy, and rather easier for buyers. Peas wore unchanged.

The Bilwouldbeopromoted:by the associatedeompuncs but the expoenses connected therewith would be borne ytheCornwalu line.
Mr. Fu8sKLL read a draught of the BUIl, after which a formal resoution was passed approving tbereof, subject to such alterations as to Parliamon ent m seem meet, and authori£ing the chairman to sign the Btih compan to of such approval. o

The question in this case touched upon ihe COnstructiOn tobeptuponthe will of Richard Watson the elder, late of Saino,i Yorkshire, and related to two estates, caled collectirely 'ae Elerlington Estate and The Stainton Estae: At the date of tho will, Ann, the testator's second wife, wtas living, and he had issue by her one sIon, Richard Watson, who wras married and had issue one son, Robert Watson, and one daughter, Ann Watson, 'who were alee then living. The testator'a fist wife left issue by. him one daughter, Margaret, *ho mrarried William Darnell, ana had issue two sons, William and Robert Darne11 and one daughter, Elizabeth DarmelLt The e
tutor by his will devised the Hemlington and Etain. ton estaes to certain persons upon trust t pay cerbtin legacies and annuities, and &hen upon trust for the beonefit ot his urndson, Rwobert Watson, and theirs of his body,

namely, to pay certain annfities, *ndthiento be held in trust eor his grandchildren, William, Robert, and Eizabeth
sarneD, the present pplla and theirheirst inequal shares, as b unants in common r The testator's zrandsoc, Robert Watson, died without isse someyearsafder he attained his majority, and Anns atson, the testator's granddaughter, took possession of the 0emlington estate. She died in 1849, leaving a31 her estates to the zescondents, 'Wiliuam Pearson *nd Willi n HilD, since deceased. Under that will the respondents claime both the Hemlingtron estate and the Stainton estate, alleging that the wnord
'in case he shall die under the age of 21 years and without issue," im,lied two contingencies, only one ef which had happen e, and that therefore on the grandson mobert Watson atnng bis majority the two estates passed to him as heir-at-lawv, he ziot having diled under 21 years of age, and that on his death theypDassezt to tAnn Watson as his heiress-at-lawn , ho bequeathn d them to the respodents. They aceordiogly filed a billagaiustthe Darnll, the present appeDlants, Zheo contended that the words, "under 2 tLears of age and without issue," ihould be read,' " under 21 years of age or writhout ianes," vhich would keep the estate within the limitations mentined by the testator, and onld thus carry out weat te urged aas his clear intention When the canse wias heard before Vice Chancellor Turner he dismissed the bill, being of opinion that both estates still continued subjec' to the ultimate lenitation contained in the will under weich the appellants claimed The redspndent appealed from this order, and the Lord Chancestar, who heard the awel, varied the hVice Chancellos order, nd decreed, that m the events which had happened the He elington estate had e- bsended to the heir-at-law of the testabr, and that the uondents vwere entilaed thereto, hut that thenultimate lImntation in the will of he Stainen estat continued in force, and that the sppelants were entitled under that limitation. The present appeal was then brought against that
ecidson.
The *rguments were concluded last honday, but their oordspips took time to consider tirudgment ti this

(BeforC r Sir R- T. KiND .
The only question in this case of any importance arose in this manner :-.The suit was instituted to admfinister t'he estate of a gentleman named Medlicott, who possessed an estate at Herne-bill, and the widow- and executrix was charged with breach of trust in making an investment In her own name, which should have been made in the names of herself and another person. The widow was -dead, and her represefntatives had put in an answer denying that there was any reeidue, and scheduled certain documents to such answer, among which was an informal will of the widow, containingthss passage;:-"The fixtures purchasedlby ne osL myremoval fromHerneahillI corkider to belongtothe estate, and not my private property," and also a stock receipt for 116&, at the bottom of 'which was vritten, "1This wzs bought with part of the money received from Mr. Garrett.
The fixtures realized 1571., and Mr. Garrett wss the pur.I chaser, and it was contended for the laintf tht a h executors of Mrs. Medlict eai ose paprs and seen,
as they ought to have done, the paessages above quoted,I great expense in inquiries would bave been saved. These executors were, therefore, asked to pay those costs personally.
M[r. E. F. Smith appeared for the plaintiff - Mr, Hanso
for parties in the same interest; Mr. Brodnek for the de. fencTants.
The Vzcx-Cu.ucELaLoR thought that, as it appearedl by the plsintiff's own argament that expensive inquiries ha
been necessary to establish the caue, it could not have been so clear upon these documents that the executers mnust have known how the matter stoodl; in fact, it 'appeared that the Master thought it doubtfuiL If the wid ow had been living she wouldhave admittedlthese facts. The costs, - th erefore, must come out of the estate.

BROOK V. BROOK.
Mr. MALTN (with whom was Mr. G. IL Russell) said that this case raised a qucestion Of very great Importance.-. that, namaely as to the validity Of a narrisgs solemnized abroad by the late Mr. Brook in the year 1851 with his deceasd wife's sister, bothx the contracting . Tarlie
being domiciled English sab'ects. The first wife of the testator In the cause M .lia Leig Brook, late of Meitham-hall, near Hudderafield, die in 187, and in 1851 the tetaUtor 3married his first wife's sister at Altoa, in Holstein. On the 17th of August, - 1855, the testatoes. second wife died of cholera, at Frankfort, and on the 19th of the same month the testator died of the same diseAse at Cologne, being on his way from Frankfort to England. The tesaUtor left surviving him fiver children-namnely, one son and a daughter by his first mnarriage, and one son and two. daughters by his secnd marriage; and by his will which! bore date on the dayof his death, he gave all his real and persnal esaUte among all his children by the two marriages iabolutelya&&tenants in common. The son by the second m4arrisg died on the 31at of March, 185, and the queston '*ouldMb as to his le 'tinicv fo if the second mar-
rnsge were legal, and Ce son'by tgat marrisg legitimate,
his half-brothter by the first marriagewould succeed to his share of -the testator's real estate, and the tesaUtoe's four survivin chfldren would be entitIled in equal portions to his share o5 the testator's personal estate, If, on the other hand, it should be held that he wag illegitimate, the Crown would be entitled to his share of the testator' real anidDpersonal estate. It wsas proposed now that minutes should be prepared with a view to direct certain inquiries as to the seond marriAge, as to the domicile of the testator and his second wife, and as to the law of Holstein on the siabject of.such a marriage as that of the testator with his second wife. When those inquires were miade the ceas

(Before Mr. Comm"itounr Goiunim.)
The bankrupt is described asa commmisson agent, of New Broad-street. Thiswas aneeting for the proof of debts and choice of assignees. From a prelininary statement of Mr. Chatteris, the acomuntant in the case, it vould apear that the debts are 64,9571., and that there are liabilities to the further amount of 35,112. The assets aro put down thus: -Good debtors, 3 2391., doubtful, 3,82; -propetty, 2 6001.; ship slip, uion w6ich a very large sum (4(R,0001.) is alleged to have been expened, anda*forestin Spain. Prac. ticll it is pposed the assets are so far nit that scaacely a dividend is epected by the creditors.
Debts to the amount of about 20,0001. were proved, and Mr. Edward Pickering, of Chatham-place, as appointed assignee.
E RE LEWIS AND IEWIS.
The bankrupts were lithographers, of Fore-street, CripPi Ite.
is' OFOUie gave judgment on the question of certi. ficate. He said the debts were 1,7601., and practically there were no asset. The bookkeeping had been egligent. Within one mouth of the bankruptcy the bankrupts had pledged goods to a considerable amount. Tle bankrupts
ad receved goods after signing a declartion of insolvency, and altogether hemusto thold at their conduct had been so far grosslyfraudulentas to call fora suspension of certificate (third class) for 12 months from the date of the exmination aDd without protection for srmonths. Three weeks pro. tection wFould, howvever, be granted, to give them an opportunity to appel._____

In the House of Representatives Mr. Campbell, of Ohio, from the Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes on the Tariff Bill, made a report. He said, in the first place, the I 00 per cent. schedule and so much of the old 40 per cent. schedule as is not reduced to the low schedules or free list are reduced to 30 per cent.; the 40 per cent. schedule, including all spices and articles not produced in that country, and which enter into general consumption, are either upon the free list or in the 4 per cent. schedule. M;Iany articles are not brought down from the 30 per cent. schedule to a lower schedule. The same is the case with the intermediate schedules between C. and I. The House Committee yielded to the amendment of the Senate, which proposed a reduction of the 'higher schedules to 30 per cent.; and in the compromise of the matter they have procured substanily the free list, yielding some immaterial points In that respect. The other schedules are reduced about 20 per cent. The remainder of the old 30 per cent. schedule is brought down to 24 per cent., the 25 to 19, the 20 to 15, the 15 to 12, the 10 to 8 and that would be about 4,000,000. He was satisfied that this bill would give relief to the country, and stimulate and strengthen the hands of American industry. They had treated iron, sugar, hemp, and lead on the principle of equality, reducing aU alike. The report was carried.
The State of Haime, referring to the action of Congress on the tariff, says, " The great measure of the past four years is the New Tariff Bill. The details of the perfected bill are not yet fally received. The House 1ill proposed to enlarge the free list without reducing the duties on other articles. The Senate Bill, with a more limited free list, reduced the duty on cotton, flour, sugar, and other articles. The Committee, in conference, made a compromise; the duty on iron, sugar, cotton, &c., is reduced from 30 to 20 per cent. ad vaoremn. The passing of the bill was resisted by Pennsylvania and the high protective interest, but it was carried in both houses."

The steamship City of Washington, from Liverpool, arrived at New York on the 3d inst., having made the voyage from New York, discharged and loaded, and arrived back again, in 30

The Chinese And Persian Wars.
THEX CHYZ,S ZADPSrSAN WA,S.
Yesterday evening a publi meeting -was held *t the Freemason's.hall, Great Qaeen-street, Liipcoln's.inn.fleld,
to consider the policy of the Chinese and Persianvwars.: The great room was literally crammed long before the hour (7 o'clock) appointed for the business of the meeting to commence, but sometime elapsed after that hour= before any person appeared on the platform; at length Mr. Cobden and Mr. Layard entered the room, and, were received with cheers. In the absence of Mr. Roebuck, who was expected to preside, Mr. Wiliam Simpson took the chair.
The CHAMiasLkw, after . few observations as to the object of the meeting, called upon Mr. Layard to address the assembly.
Mr. LuiYARD said it was not his habit to attend meetings of that kind. Since he hpd been a member of Parliament he had only attended two, and it was lessI is habit to a
par in public than his friend on his right (Mr. Cobden),
ut he thought that meeting furnished him with an excuse for breaking through this rale. When he heard that it was the intention of one or two Liberal members of Parliament to face a large meeting in London to ascertain how far that sentiment which was declared so universally toprevail that was to sweop away all their hopes of future liberty in the city of London he could not resist the appeal which had been made to him. He was not one of those who were caUed the "peace at any pricoe party." He was one of the very first who urged the necessity of hostilities with Russia. (Hisses and cheers.) He heard some manifestation of dissatisfaction; but what he was stating would rAther strengthen than weaken the argument he was about to maintain, because it would showthat int he present matter he was acting as an independent man who looked at the right and the wrong of the case, and who was not misled by any prejudices to take either one aide or the other. He considered the war with Russia a necessary war; but, Whether necessary or not, they were at war with a great Power, and in which this country could do itself honour. They were not in that war going to massacre defenceless people or to destroy undefended cities. (Cheers.) It should be rememberedthat at this moment those who were in power were trading upon this question. He knew nmen who both in and out of Parliament had opposed every measure of reform, and-who were to the backbone Tories, were likey to come into the next Parliament because they were supposed to be Palmerston men. If they were required to make sacrifices for one man and for one cause let them at least be certain that the man was " the right man" and the cause the right cause. (Cries of "Where can you get better 2") He was about to say that they ought to see whether better could or could not be found. He was not to be led away by a cry. He did not wish to embark in the boat of anyone man, however great, without inquiring into what he had dose or what he might do. It s not Lord Palmerston that they were to follow, but they were to consider what had been his past acts and what was likely to be his future policy. It had been said that there had beena combination, aconspiracy, a faction, a coalition. As far as he was concerned, he not only for himself, but on the lat of 40 or 50 as liberal-minded men as ever sat in Parisament, protested against that assertion. (Ur. Roebuck here entered the meeting, and was received with cheers. The hon. and learned gentleman having taken the chair, Mr. Layard proceeded.] Was that a factious man (pointing to Mr. Roebuck)? Was that a man given to coalitions? Was Mr. Miall a factions man? Was Mr. Fox a factious man? Were those men who acted according to their own judgment factious men ? Away, then, with the trumpery charge of coalition. The thing waS too absurd to allude to in such a meeting aS that he was addressing, and he believed the country was rapidly recovering from the delusion which it had suitedthepurposes of a party to lead it into. He would now address himself to the subjects which they were met to consider. Both the Chinese and the Persa wars were wars into which this country had beenplnuged without the consent of the people as expressed through their representatives. In respect to the war. with Persia, up to this moment they had had no explanation whatever. Thatwar was made and carried on, and peace was made and ratified, without the Houso of Commons having been consulted on the matter, or withoatthepeople knowing why or wherefore they were plunged into that war. He thought itwould appear that hostilities with Persia were even a worse case than that of the war with China. What were the facts in regard to China ? There was a vessel called the Arrow in the Canton river, and the question was whether she carried a British flag or not. Tho hon. and learned gentleman here entered into along statement of the facts which are already well known to the public respecting the attack by the Chinese on the vessel Arrow, and of all the circumstanUes that followed that attack; he also dwelt upon the despatches of Sir J. Bowring, and said that if such things as thoy contained were not on record, no one would have dared to suppose that any man living would have written them. By the unjustifiable proceedings of Sir John Bowring, the representative of the Queen of England, they had destroyed a great city, stopped a great trade, kIlled thousands of innocent men, and subjected not only the people of this country to an additional burden of taxation, but the suffering people of India also, from whom taxes were actuaUy raised by torture. Could he and his friends as independent members of the House of Commons give their sanctionito such a war? (Cries of "No," and cheers.) What did the Government tell them, That the war was made in consequence of a great many insults offered to this country by the Chinese; but those insaults were to a great extent imaginary, and the greater part of the insults, instead of being from the Chinese to Europens, were from Earopeans to the Chinese. He believed there would have been very few members in the House of Commons who would not have supported the Government if they had come down to the House and said,-" SirT. Bowring has violated his instructions; he has gone to war upon insuflicient grounds; however, we are at war, the Chinese for a long time have been violating their treaty with us,-we shall recal Sir J. Bowring (cries of INo, no; ' Yes, yes'), and thus we shall show to the world that the British Government and British Parliament wil not endorse that which is not true; but we come to you and say this war now is necessary, we are in it and we must carry it on in order to escape from it with honour to this country, and we therefore caU upon you to support ue." He believed that if the Government had made that appeal to Parliament they would have had a majority. At a private meeting of Lord Palmerston's friends they urged him to pursue that course; but he did not; he defied the House of Commons, and, the result was, he was in a minority. (Cheersm) And what had he since done? Had he supported Sir John Bowring ? No; but he complained of a coalition between the Liberals and the Peelites. Why, he himself had disavowed Sir John Bowring, and had gone to two Peelites to send them out to Hongtkong to take Sir John Bowring's place. How could he have the face to turn round upon those who had given him that very same advice? (Cheers.) Surely, if it were good now it was good then, and if it were bad then it was bad now. (Cheers.) The hon. member then referred to the war with Persia amid much impatience on the part of the meeting, and, after recapitulating the circumstances which led to that war, and commenting upon the terms of peace which vere proposed by this country and acceded to by Persia, he asked the meeting whether they would recognize the policy pursued by the Government of this country and alow them to involve the nation in war without consulting Parliament? (Cries of "No!" and cheers.y He was told that in dealing with the Easternsthey must adopt a different course than when dealing with the Westerns; but he protested against that doctrine; he considered that they ought to deal honest with people all over the world. (Cheers.)
Mr. ConBrD, then came forward to address the meeting, and was received with loud cheers. Hesaid,-I have listened to the speech of our friend Mr. Layard with very great interest, whohasrelievedme from the necessity of going into a longargament, orinto the detailsof thequestion beforeyou; but what I ask you is, whether you think it is the province of the House of Commons to inquire into these questions at all? Because what I understand is this, that here is the Executive Government appealing to the country against Parliament for having investigated those matters which were brought before us. I thought you were meeting in public assemblies to denounce the House of Commons for neglecting its duties. I thought I reid of the movement of Administrative Reformers to see that the House of Commons did its duty and not allow the Executive Government an irresponsible power over the questions of peace and war. At the the beginning of the sesion of Parliament the Queen laid before the House of Commons papers termed "Correspondence respecting affairs at Canton." In the Qceen's Speech special reference was made to those papers, and I want to ask you whether you would have told us to remain silent, whether the war in China should have been allowed to go on, and whether you would have liked your money to be spent in the continuance of that war, and your representatives to have taken no notice whatever of the proceedings? ("Nto "and cheers.) Well, Iread thw wholeof tohoe docu. mnonte, and it came home to my conviction that there was no sufficient justification for the war into which we bad entered. I brought the matter before the House, and statde inmy resolutionthat thepapersdidnotshowsuf icientgroi d fortheviolent proceedings that bad been resortedto. I must do the House the justice h say tkat I neve; remember an instance where the public documents were so fullystudied as on that occasion. But I am told that the decisdon of the House of Commons was come to, not upon the merits of the question, but from factious and party motives, We have heard a great deal about the gentlemen on the other side who voted with me on that occason, and we are told that we must not give credit to the sincerity of their votes; but we have heard nothing of the gentle. men who sit on the same side as I do who voted with the Government, and who, to my knowledge in many cases ana Ibelieve on my consienee kn:- - n - or y c eases, voted
against their better judgment, but who voted for thi
Government because they did not like to commit themselves to an adverse vote without counting altogether the consequences. Then, as to this cry of conniracy and of coalition which has been raised, they should not have raised it if it were wished to serve them for more than 24 hours. I have met with many people whom I have heard jpssing a judgment upon the House of Commons, and declaring that the vote they came to was unjust. I have asked them, " Have you read the documents 1" and the answer has been "N No." " Then , said I, "you caniot judge, unless you havo read the documents." I heird something said by my friend about certain parties who are what are called the "peaceat-any-price pirtr." I don't know whether he intend -to include me in tha number, but! thought I had cleared myself from that imputation, because, although I have declared that'I thought 10,00010007. *ere enough to pay for our defences, yet if 100,000,0002. were necessary to defend these shores from aneniemy, I would vote it as cheerfully as anybody. 'But this in not a qitestion of pace at any price; it igBs question wliether. we shall go r,000 or 14,000 miles b'z and rush heedisly And needlessly into war with a people who are very little able to defend themselves, and whqSeverkC&meto attackyo4L Itis not a war which under .ny,piritngtancei yon iec in honour by.

thing by war principles. In this tase -you ae not liely to gain either profit or hbonour. I do4't knoW what you haTe to gain if you succeed izn your' war with the Chinese. You are, shouting for apolic whichwill compelus to lay more taxes.upon ;ou, You are putting members of Parliamei4 into a fix. We cannot possibly e6sen your-taxes if you call outfor more wars. Then we are told that the Chinese are such very bad people that it iz necessary we shoulEl go and. punish them; that this Commissioner Yehhias alnugihtered about 70,000 people during his reign in his government. I have never seen any proof of that statement yet; but do you think we shall mend the matter if, in addition to the 70,000 he has slaughtered, we go and slaughter some 20,003 or 30,0001. more? Allow me to ask,-are the English people going to show in this election a less regard for lustice and moderation than has been shown in the House of Commons? The eyes of the world are upon the contest that is now going on. (Cheers:) Lord Palmerston has n) other policy. He does not go to the country upon any question of internal reform. The question before the country is whether you will endorse those violent acts which hAve been committed in China. Bear in mind thatgreatempires are looking at us, and scanning what wo are about to do. We are not now engaged in a war with Russia. That was a ar stand-up fight, where you had enemies that proved your courage; but now we are at war with a feeble nation, a most remarkable people, a people who though they have carried civilization to a great height have not attained the art of war. Yoa all know that this nation is at your feet. Will the people of this country, then, with America, France, Germany, and Austria 1ooding at us, show a less sense of justice, a less sense of responsibility and fear of bloodshed, than anmajority of theHouse of Commons? Because, let me tell you that in proportion as we show ourselves acting unjustly towards the weak, just in proportion wil be ourdifficulties in deling with thestrong. (Cheers ) I want the people of this country to hold a proud attitude before all the world. I look upon the honour of England as something not to be maintained by blustering editions in the Persian Gulf or in the river of Canton, Et I look upon the honour of England as being maintained by ever holding a course of justice, whether in dealing with the mighty or with the weak. (Cheers.) I may here tell you, in a parenthesis, that we applied for the use of Exeter-hball. It is the largest room that can be got, and I wished to test the truth of what we read of in V. Times, that there is sucb a torrent of public opinion that it. would overwhelm any ono who faced It. I therefore wanted Exeter-hall in order to try, because I am quite sore that all this turmoilis got up by cliques, coteries, and clrbs. (Cheers.), But the committee had a most extraordinary rule-thev fear that the#r bricks and mortar would be defiled if they llowed a public meeting to be held in their building upon any political question. I say this great torrent of which we read in TAe Times (groans and hisses) is, after all, notbing but a storm in a teapot, got u by clubs and coteries, who nave excited themselves, and tliink that all the world is in as great a commotion as they are, when, in truth, al the world is wondering what this commotion is about. Of all the popular delusions I ever knew this stir is certasnly the greatest. If you hear anybody make remarks in support of this Palmerston fever, just ask them what they want, Are they satisfied with things as they are? do they want no change forthebetter? If so Lord Palmerston is. precisely their man. (Cheers and laughter.) Bat if a maW wants less taxation, extension of the suffrage, abolition of church-rates, vote by ballot, or any reform in the Church or State, then I think Lord Palmerston is not the man for him. (Cheers.)
Mr. T. BorGs then moved the following reeolution --
* That in the opinion of this meeting tUe invagson of Pers and tho hoestities at Canton were whoIy unwarranted on greundas either ot Justice or policy; and this rneetlngfnrtherprotestsagainstthe practoe of involving this country in war without the knowledge or coDaentof ParliAment, and eamnesti rejoices that by the recent vote of the Hoase of Commons the nation has been saved from the reeponsibittr ofthose acteod violence andl bloodshed commte by Britinh oeThers on thei n* habitants of Canton."
Dr. EPPS seconded the resolution.
The C InhLsce wished, b7efore putting the resolution, to say a few wrords: his heaalth would not permit hinm to do more. He had consented to preside at that meeting because his feelings were in perfect union with Mr. Cobden and Mr. Layard. He supposed on this occasion, as on others, he should be acoued of some coalition. He had coalesced with everybody and had differed from everybody. He was not a peace man, but he said that war was a great calamat, and to justify war great provocation was neceesary. The polestar of his life had been England's honour. Be had always by that star directed his conduct, and if upon this occasion he had been misled by it it had been a glorions fault. (Cheers.) He believed that England's honour was compromnsed by deeds which he would aesignato as clearly unjust, and as an honest manhe felt bound to raise his voice against them. (Cheers.)
The resolution was then put and agreed to.
mr. HART then moved, and Mr. JMRmuY seconded, the following resolution -
" That the Ministem, by ranctUonil and adopting the acts of the aubordinate officers at Canton, bad,nm'oc thenmaelves r-espesiblefor an outiage committed in criminal violation of English law, and that violaton of law, whether comrmitted by a Premier or a peasant, iheuld be dealt with judicials and the offender puni'hed.'
To which reslution te following amendment was proposed by lr. BRONTERRE OVBRIEN, seconded by Mr.
LOCR}ART,-
' That if the upper ard middle cles aTe sincerely desirous of Par. llamentary reform, and to put an end to surb barbarous act Of violation and conquest M have been practised in the present war against China, they bave a ure and eay remedy In their own hands. and that is, to give the non-eleeters at the approaching general election the benemit of their second voet in erery city, eomiiy and borough that returns more than one member, by elccilsg the candidate whom the

THE- Mis-Soussmamrroxf, Monday.-The Belgian Royal mail steamer Constitution, Captain Pouigin, B.R.N., arrived here from Antworp yesterday afternoon, ein ruse for New York. She has a flU cargo and 660 pas. sengers, of which 130 tons of uargo and 56 English asen. gers (lst and 2d class) are from Southampton. She will proceed on her voyage to-morrow (Tuesday) mornin. The reninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Sultan, tain Cook, with the Peninsular mai!s, and the Royal Mail Com. pany's steamer Magdalena, Capti Abbott, with the West .ndia and Me:ican mails, will also leave to-morrow, the 17th inst. The Pen, Captain Soy, with the India and Chinm mails leaves here on the 20th. Thefollowing mail steamers are une at this port this week:--The Parana, from the West Indies, hourly expected; the Colombo, with the India and China mails, and the Etna, with the Australian, on the 20th; the Fulton, from New York, on the 20th; and the Tamar, from the Brazils, is expected in a few days.
THE HosTiuraTs A!r CaxO .-Yesterday mornint the deputtion agpointed by the meeting which was he,d in the city on Fridy waited upon Lord Panimerston, at Cambridge-house, for the purpose of formally presenting to him the resolution adopted on that occasion. There were present the Lord Mayor, Sir James Duke, Bart., M.P.; Mr. Oliveira, X P.; M1r. W. J. Hall, Mr. Elliott, MW. G. AlaUn, Mr. E. James, O O., Mr. Christie, Mr. T. G. Hit, Mr. Herbert Lloyd, Mr. Deputy Dakin, Mr. R. Bealey, Daputy Obbard, lir. J. Dillon, 1r. Alderman Rose, Sir C. D. Crosley, &c. The Lord Mayor, having introdueed the deputation, handed in the resolution. Lord Palmerston said it gave him great satisfaction to find that the course that had been adopted by Her Majestys Government with regard to late events had met with the approbation of so great a commercial community as that of the city of London. He regretted that the House of Commons should have come to an adverse vote on the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding, but, such being the case, no other course than that which the Government had adopted was open for them to follow for the protection of life and our great commercial interests in China. The Government had thought it right to protect the servants of the Crown in China in the course they had adopted, from a conviction that had any other Ministry been in power they would have acted in a precisely similar manner. The Government, in consequence of the adverse vots referred to, had-thought it necessary to appeal to the country, and he was proud to hear that a city possessing so great andso many interests as the city of London should have thuns tes tified its approbation of the conduct of the Government. The deputation then withdrew.
AlDBSS To ,SI JoHN M1'NEMI. AND COLOHEL TuLLocH.-An address, signed by 121 of the leading merchants, magistrates, bankers, and other citizens of Manebester. was recently forwarded to Sir J. M'Neill, G.C.B., and Co onel Tulloch, expressing a lasting sense of the important services rendered by-the Crimean Commissioners. In the course of the address was the foUo win paragrah:-
" IJor such servlceg rou ae well desering not th of our anks, but also of the gratitude of every rti¶h subje4 as well as of ouar full "re of these maks of distinction and approval which Government hastheposwer to bestow, c and wbichn your ca have been. too long withbeld,while in mnany inatnces tho's whose shortcomings have been'exposed through yoruegency have not only escaped well-mesited censurecbut havefeorte adacementand reward.
The signatures were headed by that of the Mayor of sanrchester, and included those o persons of vario upol ti
opinions and of influential oitio. Sir 3. vO 1, h"is reply just received, remar that the Approbation of his countrymeni in a reward which personal influence can neither procure nor withhold, andI which is bestowed only in. acknowledgent or in vindication of that regard for justice whic belongs tothe national chiaracter, and which affords the best security for the protection of the national interests. Colonel Tsloch, in his reply, says this addres affords another proof, added to miany, of r seiympathy of the British nation for his oleague and hirselfv and' that the conscientious discharge 'of a public dutyv will always secure the support of their countrymen. ,"t is true," ie continues, "1that as yet none of those marks of distinction and approval have reached us which usually await thos
who perform their duty satisfactorily, but the vote of the House of Commons on the evening of Thursday last, by

Common Juries.)
SIdIXnTOX V. HACKL7T.
Mlr. Wlatele Q., and hr. Chance apaed for the plaintiff ; andWM. erjeant PigGth andi Mr. ThiPson for the defendanit.
This was an action in whieh tle plaintiff sought to recover damages fron the defendant for maliciouslv and without reasonable or probable cause, cansing the ta'jtiff to be taken into custody upon a charge of removng his goods in order to avoid a istress for rent. There was als
a count foranasult and false imprisonment. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and also justified under a warrant. It appeared that the plaintiff, William Sum. merton, was a miller, at Smethwick, near Birmingham, but in this county. He rented a mill of the defendant, and on the 25th of December, 1855, a half-year's rent, 20l., was due. The plaintiff had made an arrangement with his mother, who ba a mill in the neighbourhood, to unito with her in worldng one mill only; and, in pursuance oE this arrngement, he caused a quantity of gram and other articles to be removed to his mother's milL The defendant, on tho 26th of January, 1856, obtained a warrant for the plaintfs apprelhenson, an the ground that he had franda4ently removed his goods to prevent a distress. The plaintiff was apprehended on the evening of the 26sh by a policeman, handcauffed, and taken to the lock-up at Smethwick, where he remained till the afternoon of Sunday, wben, the rent having been paid by his brother William, he ws liberated, It aprared that the stock of grain and other articles had been eimoved chiefly by day, but on several occasions by night also; but there was suffcientproperty left ore the premises to pay the rent duo. The warrant was applied for by the defendant, and given by him to the policeman.
Mr. Justice CBOV;DZ h'd, with re'pectto the malicous prosecution, that the plaintiff had not proved the absence of reasonable and probable cause; and, with respect to the false imprisonment, his Lordship held that,as themagstrate had granted the warrant, the defendant was not liable, althoughheohad applied forthewarrant, and had delivered it to the oilicer. The warrant was clearly bad.
The plaintiff was thereupon nonsuited, leave being given to move to set aside the nonsuit, if the Court should he of opinion that there was any evidence to go to the
CRAYE V. IRODWAY.
Mr. Keating. Q.C., and 'r. Chance appeared for tho plaintiff, and lir. Gray for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Robert Luncas Chante, was tie proprietor of a firebrick work at Dudley, and he sued the dfendant, Samnel Rodway, an auctioneer at Birmingham, to recover damages for the conversion of a quantity of fire-bricks belonging to the plaintiff, which the defendant bad sold by public anction. A man named WilLiam Cox, as agent of the plaintiff, had become possessed of a quantity of his bricks, and, becoming embarrassed, he was advised by his attorney, John Smith, of Birmingham, to make over his property to a trustee for his creditors. The bricks in question were clainedto be included in theasign. nent, and were ultimately sold by the defendant, in spte of a notice from the plaintiff that the bricks were his, and that ho should hold the defendant responsible. The bricks were sold and carried away, amid much noise and confnion, and the present action was brought to recover their value.
MIr. GtAY, for the defendant, contended that, inasmuch as the property in tbe bricks was not altered by the sale, but the plaintiff could still follow and retake them, there was no conversion by the defendant, and he was not liable in the action.
Mr. KrATiZG said that argument might apply in every case of wrongful taking,
Mr. Justice CseownDz held that the defendant was liable for- the conversion, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the amoUnt claimed, 701
BAGGALXY V. DAVY.
Mr. Keating, Q.C., and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Pigott for the defendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages for breaking and entering his stable, and talking away andconvertuMghis horse, named" ' cian " formerly te property of Lord Strathmore, and valued at 1001. The defendant paid 5B. into court in respect of the trespass, anddeniod the plaintiff's property in the horse. It appered from tho plaintiffs evidence that he was a farmer at wnittington, about 15 miles from Birmingham, and that in the month of September, 1856, he bad purchased the horse in question (a stallion) of a man named Adam Nix. Nix was a strangerwilom the plaintiff had seen pass his house several times. The plaintifFs father cautioned him against buying the horse of a stranger, but the plaintiff said that having made some inquiries he was satisfied, and bought the horse for 1001. He gave Nix 151. in cash, a mare valued at 35L, and the balance, 501., was either to be paid in cash, or NIX was to have the use of the horse during tho next covering season. The horse remained in the plaintiff's stable from September, 1856, ti the 2d of February, 1857. On that day the defendant, James Davy, a veterinary surgeon at Birmingham, came to Whittington, walked into the plaintiffs yad, took the horse out of the stable, and having started his man on tho horse to Birmingham called and left his card with the plaintiff; and told him what he had done. The defendant said the horse was his property, and that Nix bad no right to sell it. Nix was called by the plaintiff; and said he was now a farmer at Sutton, and that in April, 1855, he h agreed with Davy, the defendant, that he (Nix) should take and keep the horse, which then belonged to Davv, during the covering eon, and that they would dne tthe andfits. He said there were no profits, but a loss, through Davy's breach of agreement, and that, Davy having subsequently become indebted to him for theokeeplof the horse,it ws agreed between them that Nxshould have the homse for the debt. ;Chis witness aid ho thought he hd hadfil the horse long enough for it to " gain a settle ment," and he had thereforesold it to the plaintiff.
The defence w as that the alleged salento the plaintiff was only a " conditional chop "' that only 1l. in cash had been paid, and a mare which wVhen nine years old was worth only 161., but which, when two years older, ws nowr said to be Aorth a 5le The deindant wlas called, and contradiCed the evidencegivenbythe itess Ni and denied that be had come to any such agrcement with him as that stated. It appeared, howFever, that on the 10th of tovember, 1855, about two months after the sale to the plaintiff took place, Davy had file his schedule in the Insolvent Court, and had sworn that he had no other horses thn nthose mentioned in his schdule, anduthat he made no mention of the horse Magician.
After a lengthened trial,
Mr. Justice CnOWnza Esumed up the evidence to the jur1', who found, first, that 6a. was enough for breaking the plantiff's stable- and, econdly, they found that the defendant had given thie horse to N>ix in December, 1e55.
His LOpiDSeP thereupon directed the verdict to be enteoed fornhe deCendant, giinDg the plaintifleave to move to enter the verdict in his favonr.

In the courne of the dayh te grand jury e beinto court and ignored a bill wthich had heeu preferred against Arthur Edwin Beaufoy Dort antsorth manslaughter of his wife, Elizabeth Durant, on the 2d of MDarch, at the parsh of Brewrood.
This prisoner was a on of the late or. George Durant, of Tong Castle, and formuerly held a commission in the army in the East India Company's service, bat wals now living on his half-pay, at Shutt.end, near Brewood. His wrife died on the 26th ult., and there beingta ontused w ound on her right eye andaeveral bruises on other parts of her body the brother of Mrs. Dnrant causod a coroner's in neat to be held. Evidence was given before the coroner to sowr that the prisoner, when in a shtat of intoxication, had been in the habuit of treating his wite ith great crhelty and violence, sud that the bruise on her eye was tccasioned by his throwing a liyper at her on being called by her a " blactguari wretch ' The evidence ahowed that the deceased had been for the past two yerls ina debilitated state of health, and had snffered from palpitation of the heart. The medical evidenco showed that the immediate cause of death was the e prsion soserum on the br in; but whether that was caused by mnental disrs, or by- natural cause, they could not speak -with certainty. Under these circno aaces, theogrand jury having throwvn nat the bil, o
Mr. Justice Wss.rzs directed that no evidence shouldbho offered in support oE the coroner's inquisition. The jury accordingly found the prisoner ot Gushy, and be was diso charged.
John Jones, aged 23, engrneer, and Richard t l organ, aged 20 labourer, were charged writh a robbery wlth rio. wece on the person of Williamn Owaen t Bilston, on the 2ath of Janutpy.
Mr. Corbett appearefor-the prosecution; the prisoners were undefended.
This ws acase of gaotto robbery, aud it appered that the prisoners having bcen oresent at the Lund-hill Colliery when the prosecutor, an of d mnan, ws sent into Bilston by his master to fetch change*t the amount of 101. to pay the
wrorkmen on Saturday eveiing the 24th orJanuary, they were seen to follo*himinto ttown of Bilston, and one of them was observed watching the house in which tho old man obained the change. On his return the old mnan was attacked from bebind by three men, one of whom seized him by tho tbroat, threw himon the grounLd and held him there, pressing hhthroat sothathe couldnot call out. Mean. time the other two men seized and made off with the handkerchiefin which the ola man bad wrapped p the change.

Eliz-Abeth Mercy,. aged 35, was indicted for wilful anI cot'rupt perjury at Bedford Petty Sessons on the 20th of YeD bmiary last.
Mr. Dasent appeared for the prosecutioln hrsphensoit, defended the prsoner. i
It appti aed that the risoner, who is a German bhrth bit speraks English wellen F i at Olneydin thetemt ber last, when on the tramp with a mian named sou.

On the ev t dn the evidneo became chargeable to the parisix ofoStigul, in edfor and on the 13th of Janhary ahewas r spant Mr. Morris by the clerk of the f oordlnon, un he 6th aetion of the statute of the 9th andsu 0t of Vicr
ea.66, *hich subjects any officer of a uniotoapnlr if o shall convey, or cause to b e oveye a o
out of his parish to another with intent to mt sh
poor person chargeable to that other parish and such ce. ability shall bethereby accomplishbed. On the hearingo hs charge, the prisoner swore, inter al14a, that "s he saw ors pay Field Is. for her fare on the 9th of December that she then heard them converse together about her conveyance, when Morris told Field to " take her to Bedfor0 andt leave beranywhere, and that MorriB also then told her that she might get into the Bedford 'Union, and have a, chance of getting into the infirmary." Upon this testi. snony the justices convicted Mr. Morris and imposed a fins of 5rs. In suhport of the present chargoe Morris and Fiel

denierd that any such conversation as that detaed by thaer prisoner beforeth junticsevertookplaceinthepresence e the prisoner or elsewhere on the 9th of December, or at any other tine, or that Morris told her she aighi:s! get into the union and infirmary. For the defence it WaS agTgestpd that the story of the prisoner was substantially correct, thiougih it maight be she was not strictly accurate in stating that she had seen the moneyps or had heArd theg conversation pass between Fielvan morris, and that it would be very harsh indeed to conrviet a foreigner, no doubt imperfectly acquainted with the lanueagen n which she wa exa mined, e oferjurywhen there

His LISRDSIIP, in ffummingu g, told the jury that thera were three steps to be mnade out ~ythe prosecution. First, did the risoner swear as allleged; secondly, was it false; and, thidy, did she so swear faisely with a full knowledge that whsat she swore was false, and with the desire to sup-.
press or pervert the truth. That the two first steps were flully made out he should assume;- but thereal question wan whether the jury were satisfied as to the third. On thin, subject they would consider whether her story wa' not: sthown to he sutbstantially correct, even on the evidence of the prosecution, and whether, being a foreigner, she exactly appreciated the bearing of her ]an,&age. For his part, too, lie must say it did not appear tohm that the prisoner could have any Motive to s1pek a deliberate falsehood on her
ot.In all sheab tylie most casual paupers having goath.le in parobabishe would not care what became ot' the parish and all its inhabitants, who mDight go to the bottom of the river for -what she cared. But, on the otherz band, it was very natural that the parish and its officer
would gladly pass her onx to another parish, indifferent-. whether shLe would thereby beoomne chargeable elsewhere, and only anxious to put an end tothi own liabilityt. Ona this subject, and to check improper dealgar with casual poor by offieers the statute was pased under which Mr. Mdorris W been convicted, that proceeding having beem

PB'RACHING.
TO THE EDITOR OF TE TMES.
Sir,-Your correspondent of the devotional desert expresses the feelings of thousands who, like myself, have at length got rid of the tyrant Prejudice. The adaptation of cathedral churches to modern wants is, it is.. well known, a question of great difriculty; generally, the choir becomes practically the whole church, so that the cathedral affords about a fourth part of the acommmodatiors of an ordinary parish church. An eminent church restorerwrites :-" It is not eLsy at first sight to imagine how ouz spacious choirs are to be fiUed with legitimate occapantg, or how the thousands who should fiU our mighty naves couldl be enabled readily to join in the services."
In your correspondent's suggestion we have at least a- means of using the " mighty narves-viz., by allowing those to use them who have spiritual and bodily gifts sufficient tohll them with auditors. If any ministers of the Englisl, Chaurch have such gifts, by all means let them have the preference; should they be on the staff of the cathedral, it would be all the more a cpropos and in order; but, in theabsence of such, for Heaven's same let us admit those ol
other orthodox communiona. Walkdng, as I frequently do, in the sublime nave of Westminster, I, for one, should not feel that it was more chily and more useless from knowing that it was occssionally occupied by an earnest preacher anm! by thousands of attentive and profiting people. The pec. tacle, week;by week, beneath the majestic dome of St., Paul's and tho time-honoured vaulting of . Westrninster Abbey of an earnest and ablepreselher and crowds of hearer3 calling themselves by many names, and yet all Chriistn, is too inviting to be unrealized, at 1east in imaginition. le the Church of England is the Church of the people, aud zotk of a section, will it not think on these things?
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.
