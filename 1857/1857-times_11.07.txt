POLICE. MAIONtoR.noUszharlis Tubbs and Samuel Bromley wvere brought before the LORD M.YOR (the former upnn remaud), cha.rged with having stolen a quantity of plate, conSisting of silver forks, gravy and tea spoons, &o., of the value of 12g, from the house of MIiss Harriet Brown, a lady of indeptendent means, residing at 38, St. Petersburg.place, Tubbs was stopped by a policeman in Bishopsgate-street, on Monday last, with the pate in his possession, and brought up and remanded. Bromley was on Wednesday taken into custody for attempting to pick a gentleman's pocket, and he was now placed by the side of Tubbs to answer the more Eerious charge of the plate robbery. At the former examination a city police officer, named tobert Eno, said, that from information he received be stopped Tubbs with a basket on his arm containing plate, which was covered by walnuts. The prosecutrix was caUed yesterday, and identified the plate produced by the officer, which she said was stolen from her house on Monday last, about two hours before Tubbs was found with it in his possession; its value was about 121. Henry Hill, a carenter, said,-On Monday last I was in Holborn, when I obsered the two prisoners and another man pass me. Tubbs was carrying the basket produced by the officer on his arm, and Bromley was walking a little way behind him. Knowing the latter I turned round and looked at him. They were both walking very fast. I noticed a silver spoon or fork in the trowsers pocket of Bromley as he passed me, and I felt convinced they had been committing a robbery. I followed them into Bishopsgate street, when I commnunicated with the officer Eno, .who seized Tubbs, but Bronley and the other man escaped. I haave known Bromley to be a pickpocket for the last four Henry Francis, a boy of 13 years of age, said,-I know the prosecutix's honse. On Monday last., about 11 o'clock, I saw Tubbs looking through the window, which was partly open. The prisoner Bromley was waiting outside in the street. I had occaslon to go to the house about an hour afterwards, when the servant told me that the plate had been stolen. The prisoners, who made no answer to the charge, were fnuly committed for trial to the Central Criminal Court. GUILDLnLT.-Michael M'Donough, apparently a decrepid old man, at present one of the inmates of the NVest London Unlon,was placed at the bar before Sir P. LAURIE, charged with a savaOge and brutal assault upon another pauper in the The assault complained of took place on the 12th of October last, on which occasion the complainant received such severe injuries that he had been unable to leave the hospital during the interval. Mr. Philips, the master of the union, attended on the first examination, and stated that the complainant's eye was completely gouged from its socket; and the prisoner was remanded from week to week until yesterday, when the injured man was able to attend. 'William Brendell stated he was occupied picking oaknim on Monday, the 12th of October last, when the prisoner took away some of his work, and upon beiDng remonstrated with said he shoafld take it whenever ho thought proero Witness said he should not have his work, and, upon taking it back, the prisoner hprun_ up in a great passion and struck at him across the table, but only succeeded in knocking off his hat. The prisoner then seized him by the hair of his head with one hand, while with the other he inflicted a shower of blows on his face with great violence, and continued beating as long as he was able. Witness called for assistance, but none of the other paupersnwould rescuehimfrom the prisoner'sclutches. One blow was so severe that the felt the prisoner's knuckle enter the socket of the left eye and crush the eyeball. As soon as he could disengage hims-elf from the prisoner he ran to Mr. Phillips, the master, -who sent him to the ospitaL The prisoner said, the complainant struck him first with a stick. The complainant denied having done anythino beyond whbat he had stated to p rovoke such a ferocious attack. Two paupers nanmed Squires and Forster gave evidenc with regard to the complainant being assaulted by the prisoner; and, with regarl to the iniury sustained by the former, they stated that they saw the complainant's face covered with blood and his left eye bleeding profusely.

METROPOLITAN BOARD OX WORKS. An ordinary meeting of the Board was held yesterday in the Court of Common Pleas, GuildhOls, Mr. Thwaites, the chairman of the Board, presiding. The usual financial statement showed that the total general balance in favour of the Board amounted to 48,503l., including a sum of 3,349. set apart as a sinldng fumd for the repayment of mortgage debts. THE SOUTH-EASTERN PARK. Deputatons from the vestries of St. George the Martyr, Sonthwark, Bermondsey, and St. Olave's, Southwrark, were heard on the subject of the locality of the South-13astern Park. A mnemoria was read from the siarish of St. Miary, Newington, praying the Board to defer coming to a decision upon the matter at present. CALEDONIAN-ROAD SEWER. A deputation from Islington presented a memorial against tbe constrnotion of the Caledonian sewer, which was set down at 1,390 feet, and the estimated coat at 4,2501. The allegations in the memorial were referred for consideration to a committee. CONPERENCE WITH THE FIRST COISSSON-ER OF HER MAJESTY'S WORKS. The clerk read the chairman's report of the result of the conference with the First Commissioner on the main intercepting drainage, whtch set forth the leading points discussed at the interview, a report of which appeared in Thme Times of yesterdy The report of Vthechairman was ordered to be entered on the minutes of the Beard. MR. CARPMAEL said the Board had a duty to perform inreferenceto thechairman's report. The statute required the Board to prepare a plan for the main drainage of the metropolis. They accordingly prepared a plan, and submitted It to the First Commissioner; bat the Commissioner bad not accepted it, so that at the present moment the Board waswithouata plan, andtheywerein thesamepositionasif they had never prepared any plan whatever, with this exception, that they tad floating between the Commissioner and themselves a series of plans, part prepared by the Board, and part prepared at the request of the First Commissioner. It had been suggested that the engineer of the Board should meet the Government referees, having associated with him two members of the Board. He disagreed with that suggestion so far as the two members of the Board were concerned, for they would be reduced to mere ciphers at any such conference; or else on returning to the Board they would be mere ciphers there, seeing that they were only two out of a body of 46. He did not conceive that the Board would ask any members toplacethemselvesinthatposition. StiU hewas two des3rous to have a conforenco between their engineer and the Government referees; thereforo he had prepared a resoluxtion to deal with that portion; and he hoped some other hon. menaber would propose a resolution in reference to the fi.acial branch of the question. It would be unfair to require the engineer of the Board alone to meet the two Governmental engineers, as each party would probably be desirous of upholding his own particular views. Ele had on a former occasion proposed that their engIneer should be assisted in making a joint report on this subject by two other engineers, and he was not sorry that he was successfully opposed on that occasion, as they had since obtained a positive statement, which could not be altered, as to what were the principles upon which the First Commissioner of Worksintende toact. Hisimpression at the former interview in November last year with the right hon, gentleman and he believed It was the impression of the worlm was river to sueo vwist QUsU b1us ewe virsw., a ru,rem on the map by the Commissioner himself, under the instructionlsof CaptainBurstal, theywrouldhav complied with al the requirements of the statute, and that if it were considered necessary by the Government that the sewage should be carried further down the river it should be done somce way other than by imposing a tax upon the ratepayers of the metropolis. lie could not have a stronger proof that his impression was correct than the statement contained in the letter addressed by the First Commissioner himself to the referees, whom he instructed to deal with that part of the subject in a separate and distinct form from the internal arrangement for the main drainage. But it appeared now, from the conference of Thursday, that that was not the real state of things, and that the Government was not in any way prepared to deal with the expense of extending the outfalls beyond B- down to Sea Reach. The Board could not but express its thank-s to their chairman for the able and satisfactory manner in which he represented their views at the conference. (Hear, hear.) This being the state of the case, it became their daty to proceed in preparing other plans, and the resolution he beggedto propose was, that the engineer of the Board, together with such professional aid as he might require, be instructedto meet and confer with the Government referees, If this question were abouttogo to the House of Commonsor thelouseof Lords, it would be their bounden duty to have such professional assistance afforded to their engineer, in order to satisfy the committees of either House of Parliament. Colonel KENNEDY seconded the resolution. Mr. DOmLTON could not agree with the resolution, because, in his opinion, before taking that step there were certain preliminary matters which the Board ought to take into consideration. Besides, were they sure that the First Commissioner and the referees would accede to sucha conference? There were the points of expense and extension of the area. On both those questions the First Commissioner had enpressed a very decided opinion. The CIIAIIIAS said that the question of the area was dissosed of, it having been given up by the First Commissioner. Mr. DouILToN did not so understand it from the report. The CHIRMlAN clearly understood that the First Commissioner was pregared to give up the point as to an additional area, and to conhne the Board to the interception of the sewage which flowed into the Thames within the metropobtan area. Mr. DOULTON thought it would be advisable to have a special day fixed for the discussion of the whole question. Mr. SAVAGE expressed his agreement with the opinion of Mr. Doulton, and accordingly moved, as an amendment, - That tbheroport of the hsirmnaun boesally tsken into conaiderstien on Friday next." MIr. WA,RE seconded the amendment, Mr. WRIGHT, having ascertained from the chairman that shorthand notes were taken of the conference, suggested that those notes should be printed and circulated among the members of the Bo3rd. Mr. IL L TAYLOR approved the suggestion; at the same time he could not refrain from repeating his objection to all conferences. He was for havin everything reduced to black and white, and then it would be impossible for ministers to repudiate their own deliberate expressions. Mr. D'1FFANGER denied that the First Commissioner had ever given an assurance that the funds for carrying the sewage from B' to Sea Reach should be found by the Government. He should support the amendment, and thought that the Board should have an interview with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ascertain whether they might expect Government support. It had been said the ought not to expect it, but it was well known that Governments were made of squeezable materials. After some further discussion the original motion was withdrawn, and the amendment adopted in the followlng terms:- -That the cbaIrman's rerortbe sPecIally taken uteo ondlderaEtoa on Monday weeek, and that the shorshaud v.witer's notes ot the oDn ference between the Jlxst Commasioner and the Chairman ot thBoard bo eprntel and circulated among tho members of the Board." SOLtTIIARK.PARK. The Board then proceeded to the consideration of the report of the committee submitting plans and estimates for a pa2k in the south-eastern portion of the metropolis, to be called Southwark-park, and having disposed of that and somel further buainess of a routine character the Board adjourned.

PROBOGATION OF PARLIAMB.NT. Yeeterday morning there waa a f urther prorogation of the Imperal Parliament, In accordance with Her Majesty's Order in Council, issued at a Court held at Winadsor Castle on Wednesday last. The proceedings were of a purely formal charcter. The Lord Chancellor, who wss accompanied by Earl (raylfle and I:ord Campbell, entered the house in their full robes as peers, preoeded by the Deputy Sergeant at Arms, and took theit seats as Royal Commissioners in front of the throne. By command of the Commisioners, Mr. Pulmaan, the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod, proceeded to the House of Commons for the parpose of summoning the members, who were represented by tho Chief Clerk (Sir Denis Le Mar. chant) and other gentlemen officiaUy attaohed to that branch of the Legilature. Sir John Shaw Lefevre, the Clerk to the Parliaments, then read the Royal Commission, commanding the Royal Comi missioners further to prorogae Parliament antil Thursday December 17, to which day the Lord Chancellor declared it accordingly prorogued. The ceremony then terminated.
LONDON, SATUBDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 187. It Is certain that the fall of Delhi and the speedy suppression of the Indian mutiny will be a gain on other grounds than those of humanity and national prestige. The cost of this terrible episode in our history will certainly not be smalL True, as far as human judgment can discern, the futare benefit will more than counterbalance the present expense. But the expense is not the less to be met now, and anything which will tend to leasen it must be considered a piece of national good fortune. There is certainly no other country which could have transported 50,000 men so quickly from various parts of the world to the scene of disturbance. A large army from home, 5,000 men diverted from the Chinese exP.&i±Jso.- de'ir6 Ab flcwdili cies of the CROWN, wll before this have landcd on Indian soil. But the despatch of this vast force with such celerity and completeness has, of course, necessitated a large outlay, and even though the rebels be crushed as an army it will be necessay to maintain strong bodies of Europeans to punish the robberies, murders, and other outrages to which the country must be exposed from desperate bands of outlaws. The cost of transport will be very large, for some of the finest steamers and the largest and fastest clippers in the world have been taken up in order to convey the troops in the shortest time possible. The military stores and the outfits of the men sent suddenly on this service must also add a large sum to the account. So it is not at all too early to speculate on the manner in which unforeseen disbursement is to be met. A few months since we were congratulating ourselves on the return of peace, reduced armaments, and economical habits. The removal of the Income-Tax and of more than one obnoxious impost was almost within sight. A long series of years spent in producing and consuming, earning and saving, seemed a certainty. But the millennium of Manchester was not to be yet. The Persian WVar was scarcely over when the Canton troubles began, and these were soon to be forgotten amid the tempest which is still raging. However, we must, in justice to our patient and hardworking people, continue to keep in prospect a remission of taxation and a reduction of expenditure. Where the national honour i3 concerned they have never declined either to fight or to pay. Where the safety of a colony has been threatened by a foreign enemy or the maraudings of an'y mavage race, they have readily sent regiments to protect the settlers, and afterwards taken the whole expense on themselves. But this kind of self-sacrifice may be carried too far. If the inhabitants of these two islands are to bear every charge which is incurred by the treachery or turbulence of any race throughout the Empire, a time must come when people will begin to listen to those who declare that a country has no business with dependencies, that we should cut our colonies adrift, and have no other than commercial relations with any spot beyona the four seas. We cannot conceive anything more malignant and unprovoked than this Bengal mutiny. The people were prosperous beyond any precedent within the range of history, the soldiery were well treated and welU cared for in old age, their relgion was not only respected, but even honoured as a kind of dominant cihurch, their prejudices of caste were inviolate, their caprices too much humoured by the negligence or good nature of the authorities; yet, without a cause or even a pretext, they burst into insurrection over an extent of 1,500 miles, slaughter their officers, violate women, cut chilIren into pieces, and crown their audacity and insolence by setting up a King of their own out of the degenerate family of the MocuLs. The peasantry have not indeed joined them, but it is more than probable that a ieh and influential class has not been unwilling to profit by the misdeeds df the soldiery. These considerations lead but to one conclusion. India should be made to pay entirely, or in great part, the cost of the struggle. A war contribution might be fairly levied on the provinces which have been the scene of such atrocities. Actively or passively they have been guilty, and should bear the punishment. Every class and creed in India should be made to feel that the race which rules them cannot be defied and injured rwith impunity. While we punish the mutineers with death or banishment, we ahould give the country u general a lesson which will discourage it from any repetition of the late enormities. India is rich in hoarded wealth. For years that country has been drawing in and absorbing silver at the rate, it is said, of siX millions sterling annually. Within no very long period forty miUions are calculated to have passed from European circulation into the coffers or hidingplaces of these Asiatics. There are in India fortunes which i would be considered immense even in the City of London. The Baboo bargains and speculates, and I scrapes and saves, until he has amassed millions of rupees, while his taxes are next to notbing. The taxes of the country are, indeed, heavy, but they all fall on the unfortunate ryot. The tax on salt, like any which affects an article of universal consumption, is a poll-tax. The peasant uses as much as the rich man who is covered with shawls and studded with diamonds. The peasant pays a rent, and a high rent, for his land; the wealthy trader escapes. In fact, as in most Eastern countries, taxation is irreg.ular, unsystematic, and falls with greatest weight on those who ought to be spared. It must be remembered, also, that the wealthy Hindoos owe to us the security which allows them to heap tegether their wealth. There is no Prince, or Vizier, or licentious Palace Guard to despoil them, to denounce them, to bring them to the dungeon or to execution. In return for this safety and tranquillity we have a right to demand that they shall add to the resources of the State. A contribution in some form or other to the present necessities of the Empire should be exactcd from those most able to bear it. Perbaps a PropertyTax, extending the burden over a series of years, would be the simplest and most equitable device. It seems to us that the consideration of this question can be no longer delayed. The cost of the Indian struggle has, no doubt, addedc to the difficulties of the present financial crisis. We are told that three or iour millions sterling in specie may be considered to have been remitted to India since the outbreak. Every endeavour should be used to put a stop to such a state of things. The Indian Government should deal with the insurrection as if India were an independent country. Suppose this to be the case, and England to be merely an ally which furnishes the legitimate Sovereign with men to uphold his rights. Then, of course, the Government which invoked and received assistance would be forced to pay al the expenses of transport by sea and land of military stores and munitions, besides supporting the whole army while engaged on the service. The sums necessary would, of course, be levied on the country which was the seat of insurrection ; and, if the loyal suffered with the treacherous, it would only be in accordance with the inevitable law which links together for good or evil aU the members of a community. Let, then, the Indian Government look at once to its financial affairs. The people of England are not disposed to be taxed for Sepoy atrocities. The Govr.xor-G NERAL and his Council have the country in their hands, and in aU that is right they will be supported by the CAowi,- the Parliament, and public opinion at home. If it be necessary to suspend specie payments, to issue Government notes, bearing interest, but inconvertible during a fixed term; if the disorganization of the country and the diminution of revenue from opium and other sources require new expedients for raising money, let them consider the matter fully, and boldly state their objects and their demands. The nation has learnt enough of India to preclude the success of any humanitarian cry about exaction and extortion; it 'will, we are sure, grant any reasonable powers to a Government which gives proof of capacity to act with courage, wisdom, and severity.
The position of 'he (reat Metrop114-' -:__- -- "ens JiS JU llow w te not only very interesting, but remarkably mteigiole. The day before yesterday all the parties concerned in the matter met in Whitehall-place by their authroriied representatives and went straight to the points before them. Mr. TIwA1TEs spoke well, Sir BENJrA3N HALL spoke well, and nobody attempted to shirk the case in any way. The whole report of the conference, which appeared at ful length in our last impression, is well deserving of perusal, and will be found instructive by most readers, whether in town or country. After some years of abortive projects and insincere proceedings the drainage of London on an effective and comprehensive system was made compulsory by Act of Parliament, and the new Metropolitan Board of Works was tied down to the actual execution of the task. It was necessary that their designs for this purpose should receive the approval of the First Commissioner of HER MAJESTY'S Works and Buildings, and a plan was accordingly submitted to Sir BENJAIAN HALL in pursuance of the enactment. This first schemewas not approved, and an amended scheme was therefore produced, known in the language of the controversy as Plan B*. This was referred by Sir BENJAN,nN to three independent professional engineers, who, after deliberating for some months on the subject, came forward with their conclusions embodied in a plan of their own. This, again, which may be regarded as the plan of the Government, was not honoured with the approval of the Board of Works, and it was under such circumstances that the conferenee took place with a view to some adjustment of terms. Sir BENJA.NMW HALL stood up for the Government scheme, Mr. THWAITES for the principles of B*. The points at issue admit of easy elucidation without any reference to the technicalities of engineering or mechanism. The true objects of a good drainage scheme have now been placed beyond dispute, and the simple question is, what liberality of interpretation shall be given to the injunctions of the statute. London, the Thames included, must be thoroughly drained of its impurities, and those impurities must be carried off to a distance. This much is acknowledged on all sides; but what dimensions are to be assigned to this metropolitan area, and to what distance is the sewage matter to be carried ? On the decision of these points turns the great question of the cost, and on the extent of the cost hinges the approbation of that large ratepaying body which Mr. THWAITES very faithfully represents. Here was the true subject of contention. The Board of Works desired very naturally to bring the taxation of its constituents within as narrow limits as possible; Sir BENJA.MIN as naturally desired to see the execution of a thoroughly grand and serviceable work. TheBoard was under temptations to "t scamp" the job. Sir BaxNJAMLN'S conceptions were likely enough to partake of that lofty profusion which often attaches to the expenditure of other people's money. The first proposal of the Board seems to have been really too illiberal. They had screwed a little too far, and the Fist Commissioner was " down "upon them" in a trice. The original plan would not even havn satisfied the literal conditions of the Act of Parliament, for it failed to carry the sewage to such a distance down the river as would insure its non-appearance with the next tide. After this the Board stretched a point, and came out with B*, against which it does not appear that the same objections could be established. In point of fact, this plan seems to meet the immediate requirements of the metropolis and to fulfil the behests of the statute, but the shave is so close and the practice so sharp that the result is not at all likely to give eventual satisfaction. The G,vermuent iwhoemo prominses far botter ia this respect; but thea it trebles the area to be drained, adds immensely to the magnitude of the works, and asks for a million and a-half more money in carrying the point of outfall to a much greater distance. Mr. TUWAiTES did not gainsay the superiority of the Government plan in this latter respect. He fully admitted the excellence of the amendment, but, as it represented more than the metropolitan ratepayers were absolutely bound to perform, be thought the additional charge to be thus entailed should not l:e levied on the property of his constituents. They were ready to fulfil their obligations, but anything exceeding those obligations should be provided for by appeals to other quarters. Sir BmxTamrms ideas soared far above pounds, shillings, and pence. He would not even admit that the question was a question of finance, although to our poor notions it seems to be as plainlyso as ever question could be. He thought that we citizens of London ought to be so impressed -with the grandeur of our obligations and the distingLuished character of the duties committed to us as to forget any petty suggestions of economy. " This was a great work," said he, " intrusted " to the Metropolitan Board-a work that would " last for ages and generations to come, and ought " to be carried out in the best, the most generous, "and the most liberal spirit." To all the vulgar commonplace arguments about expense and difficulties the First Commissioner replied by pointing to the taxzable capital at the command of the Board; and he condescended for the moment to the use of figures in order to show the trifling character of the necessary rate. Say that the Board wanted 5,000,0001., they would get it for a rate of less than 51d.-positively less than 51d., and he put it to them whether they would hang back in this glorious and magnificent undertaling for the sake of 5id. in the pound? Poor Mr. TRwArxss kept on asking in a singlemninded way where the money was to come from, but Sir BBJNsIrN promptly declined to entertain such a question for a moment. " I am not speak"ing of that," said he, " I am speaking only of "the amount required for this great work." Yet he did so far touch upon this servile topic as to impress the deputation very distinctly with the fact that they must not look to Government or Parlia. ment for money. Of such a thing Sir BENJA3IN S"never had a glimmering of an idea." So, as Government wanted everything and would give nothing, "there," as Mr. THWAITEs bitterly exclaimed, "was an end of it." If the First Commissioner be supposed to represent the country, minus the metropolis, in this business, there can be no doubt that the country is greatly indebted to him for his dexterous and profitable policy. He recommends the metropolis to do a little more than they are bound to do, and reimburse themselves by reflections on their own generosity and grandeur. Yet we cannot avoid remarking that the cultivation of so lofty a spirit in ordinary affairs would be likely to bring insolvency very closely on the heels of magnificence, nor is a rate of 5id. in the pound quite a matter of indifference even to opulent London. Sir BENJAnN forgets for the moment that 5id. is not unlikely to swell in the end to a rather larger figure, and that even then it will only represent one rate out of many. In SwiFr's ironical Advice to Servants every menial is recommended to form an estimate of his master's income, and assume that the whole of it is available for the costs of his own particular department. What ! thinks Sir BENJArmN, twelve millions' worth of rateable property not stand a fivepenny rate ?-aUl this prodigious area covered with remunerative edifices not provide for its own drainage? But we have got other things to do besides draining our habitations, and these things have already come to represent rather an unpleasant aggregate. The whole draioage affair, indeed, has been eminently burden- --. _-_ . ,. -_ ___. 7S- - _ _4 °E" IPt ; commenced, so costly is the present makeshift &ud ineffectual system that rates are extremely high, and the Board of Works has actually inherited from its predecessors an immense debt. Add to theee obligations those likely to arise from a new and probably expansive scheme of metropolitan drainage, and the result will justify in the minds of most people the hesitation of Mr. THWrTEs and his colleagues. However, the thing must be done, and what is worth doing at all must in this, as in all other cases, be worth doina well ; but it is really discouraging to think that we are about to incur an enormous expense in ejecting from our city, without the smallest profit, a mass of refuse which would constitute the wealth of a whole Chinese province.
What we can do in the matter of national education is becoming more and more clearly defined every day. We must help the people to educate themselves. That is all which, under the existing, circumstances of the country, we can do, and it is as well that we should know it. We cannot give anything to be called education in our poor-class schools. The children leave too soon,I owing to the great demands of manufactures and agriculturo upon a child's labour. Sir J. K.y SHUTTLEWORTH at the meeting of the Lancashire Union of Mechanics' Institutes struggles against that fact, aud will not hear of our manufactures at all standing in the way of our education. " I have heard intelligent and " able men insist that this state of things is almost a necessity; that we cannot have a great manu"facturing system and at the same time a highly "educated people; that we cannot undersell all "other nations and command all markets by means of cheap labour, and yet educate our own people efficiently; and it has been argued "that we must improve education within the "Elmits assigned by our commercial pre-eminence. "I do not believe any such dochilc." Sir J. KAY Sn1uTTLEwoRTH may not believe it, and he may be right in not doing so. We cannot dogmatize on such a subject, and say that so and so must be and always will be the case. kt the same time we must frankly say that we see more in the doctrine than Sir JA.L1s seems inclined to allow. This difficulty may be cleared some day, but for the present we must confess that we do not see our way out of it. Sir JA)rEs promises us a solution by means of the improvement of machinery. " The single fact of the constant "effect which improvements in machinery have to "free us from these embarrassments" is enough for him. " I find throughout Yorkshire that the "disuse of the labour of women and children in "mills is constantly proceeding." WVell, if machinery goes on improving in this direction, it will, of coiuse, set free another year or two of the child for the purpose of education. But how do we know that it will? Science is a very mysterious worker, and seldom gives us a day's notice of what she is going to do. We 'wake up in the morning and hear of some new discovery which will have a wide practical bearing. In this state of things we must not pretend to see very far before us. We live amid changes and shiftings ; one obstacle is removed and another comes; a spring is touched, and a thorough transposition of data takes place. But, speaking, for the present and of the present, we do not see our way very clearly out of this difficulty of the labour-market. We cannot then, we say, and do not, c(licate in our poor-class schools. What we do is, we give the children the means of educating tchmselves. We teach them to read ; we put an instrument into their hands by the use of which they can, if they like, attain considerable cultivation subsequently, The power to reW iA the key to the whole treasure-house of knowledge,-the whole gathered stock of the ideas of the human race. Give a youth this key, then, and if he has any natural ability or taste for knowledge he can educate himself by means of it. But this is what we do for him. It is ridiculous to say that we can give him education when he leaves us at the age of 10 or 11, but we can give an important preliminary to it. As for the thing itself, it must be selfeducation or nothing with our poor. But because our poor must educate themselves it does not follow that we cannot assist them in that task. We can provide books to read, rooms to sit in, lectures, and other helps of that kind. Only the clever ones will make use of these opportunities; clever men alone can educate themselves; but a certain proportion of the poor, just as of the rich, are clever, and will do this. Those are the persons, then, whom we can help to help themselves, and we can do this by various means, by libraries and lectures, and the old appliances of Mechanics' Institutes, or-which is the newest device for the purpoe-by annual examinations and distribution of medals and certificates. This is the latest improvement in the way of stimulus to self-education among the poor, and the old machinery of Mechanics' Institutes has been adroitly turned to this purpose. It was generally observed that these institutions were not working very well; their first freshness was over, the class for whom they were intended made comparatively little use of them, and as for science, they did next to nothing for it. The operatives who used them at all read the novels, and passed over the dry shelves. But the dead or dormant institutions still supplied the machinery for another kind of stimulus-viz., the annual examination. Mechanics' Institutes have accordingly united for this purpose, and the East Lancashire Union of Mechanics' Institutes sent up its pupils the other day to its first auniversarythe examination and distribution of medals for 1857. This is, of course, a fresh stimulus to self-education. Many a clever young operative feels the appeal to his ambition as sharply as an academical student does. This arena of display wil have great charms for him; it wil elicit much latent strength, and supply an annual object to him to work for. We are only afraid of the stimulus going too far, and producing too much mental work for a class so severely taxed in body, and exhausting the ardent and aspiring minds in this class. Sir J. I&Y S1UTTLEWORTH and Sir J. PAxoTGTON wish to add to this ambitious motive to intellectual improvement in the operative class a prudent motive as well. They want to open the Excise, Customs, and Post-office to this class, and to offer all the subordinate posts in these departments for competition. Thus 12,618 offices of from 501. to 801. a- year, supplying 700 or 800 annual vacancies,besides another and higher class of appointments, of from 601. to 1001. a-year, producing annually 300 vacancies, will be enlisted in the cause of education, and will, as rewards of the best examination, stir up a vast quantity of mental exertion in the operative classes. The action of such a large list of prizes-and such substantial ones too-is not unreasonably expected to be very telling, for prizes stimulate a far larger number than those who actually get them; all who make the trial have responded to the call, as well as those who succeed. At present these offices ouly serve to reward the constituents of those M.P.'s who support the Government. Employed in the way now proposed, they may perhaps render that difficult affair, the carrying on of HuR MAJEsTv's Government, more difficult than ever; but there is no doubt that they will, as stimulants, cover a very large operative area, and extract a good deal of mental labour out of this class. 'W. 'nnn0+ fLw our part, venture to predict that the action of such a scheme -would be by any means unmixed. There would be a good deal of alloy in it,-post eqitem sedet eure ;disappointment, vexation, exhaustion, and disease, either bodily or mental, or both, as naturally attend upon the powerful use of intellectual stimulus as bad air does upon crowded population or indigestion upon good dinners. You will kill a great number of poor young men as certainly as if you shot them, and you will not get better public servants. But the scheme has the merit of being effective for its purpose. Self-education on any large scale certainly wants a powerful stimulus, and you try to give it.

TRE Ca WNPORE MASSA OBE. The following detailed account of the outbreak it Cawnpore, the long siege which the European garrison underwent, and the final masacre, is probably, the moat complete and authentic record of this protracted series of horrors which we shall ever obtain. We fear, however, from the cenes described by the first of General Havelock's force which entered the cantonments that, terrible as this account is, it falls far short of the reality, and that much more revoltiug excesses than are described by Mr. Sheppard were perpetrated by the monsters who are the subjects of Mr. Grant?a clemency. One personage, Azimullah Khan, who is here mentioned, will be remembered by many persons in London, he havng reided for at least two years in this country aS the einsary of the so-called Rajah of Bithoor, Nena Sahib. We trust that juastice has ere this overtaken him:- " Previous to the outbreak at Cawnpore reports of different kinds were afloat in the station, from all of which it was ascertained that the native soldiery, whenever they should break out into open mutiny, would on no account molest or hurt the European community at Cawnpore; and the informers employed by General Sir Hugh Wheeler on all occasions confirmed the same. They reported that the three infantry regiments (Ist, 53d, and 56th) appeared well disposed towards our Government, with the exoeption of a few Sepoys of relly bad character, bat that the 2d Regiment Light Cavalry (who were discontented) were endeavouring to persuade them to rebel, when all would join and proceed in a body together to Delhi, after pos6essing themselves of all the Government money lodged in the collector's treasury, which they proposed taling on as a present to the newly created King there, whom they acknowledged to be their trae sovereign. " Under the above suppoeitlon the European merchants and others of the station, though they had at first provided themselves with boats and other means of escape from Cawnpore, abandoned the Idea of deserting this place. The only precaution that appeared to he necessary was to avoid the fury of the mutineers at the moment the outbreak might takre place. " For this purpose almost the whole of the non-military residents were promised shelter In the intrenched camp, then under preparation under the Genera's directions. This promise appears to have completely satisafed them, and all determined to continue to stay at Cawnpore. " The General at the samAe time took the precaution to direct the Commissariat to lay in in the intrenchment a supply of olta, daU, ghee, salt, rice, tea, sugar, rum, and malt liquor, &c., calculated to last for 30 days for about 1,000 persons. This was accordingly done, though not quite In full of indents, in consequence of some mismanagement on the part of the newly created purchasing agent Chuuna Muu. " The A ssistant-Commissary (Mr. Beily) in charge of the magazine was directed to blow up the magazine the moment an outbreak sbould take place. " The coUector of Cawnpore (Mr. Hilereden) vw also directed to convey away all his treasure from the treasury into the intrenchment, but under certain circumstances (which I have not been able correctly to ascertain) it was not done. " About this time the 'Narina' of Bithoor offered his services, and, pretending to be a moat faithful subject of Government, undertook to protect the treasury in conjunction with our own Sepoy guard with a couple of his guns and about 2,000 men in his employ. Very great confidence ap. pears to have been placed in him, and his services were accepted; and in the meantime about a lac or upwards of rupees was withdrawn and placed in the intrenchment under the plea of meeting the salaries of the troops, &c., for May, leaving about eight and a-half lacs in the treasury. " The Executive, Commissariat, and pay officers, with all their records and treasure chests, were removed from the west side of the canal into bungalows adjacent to the intrenchment. " On the 3d of June it was thought proper not to keep any public money under the Sepoy guard at the office, and, accordingly, the Commissariat treasure chest, containing about 34,000 rupees in cash and the Govermment paper deposits of Goma3htas and others, together with the cashbook, security, deposit, saud other important books, were taken into the intrenchment and placed in the quarter guard there. " About sunset on that date the 3d Onde Horse Battery, which had been sent for our assistance some few days ago from Lucknow (and had been ordered to proceed towards Futtehghur to quell a disturbance in thatquarter, but since recaUed) joined the intrenchment. "About three days previously, reports becoming very strong of the mutinons intentions of the cavalry, all the non-military ChistiUanresidents remored into the church and other buildings near to the intrenchment. " On the 4th many more important books, stock, and cash ledgers, Relief Report (then nearly f&iished), books of regulations, &-c., were also taken by the Commissariat t fficer into the intrenchment. '"The 2d Cavalry, finding that they could not prevail upon the infantry regiments to joini them, determined to go off, and, under the plea of having received some real or imaginary slight from the officers of their corps, on a sudden, at about 2 o'clock in the morning of the 5th of June, rose in a body with a great shout, mounted their horses, aud on leaving their lines set fire to the bungalow of their quartermaster sergeant. Thence, proceeding to the Commissariat cattle yard, they took possession of the Govern ment elephants, 36 in number, at the same time setting fira to the cattle sergeant's bungalow. " While the main body proceeded towards Nawabgunge a few of the ringleaders went to the lines of the 1st Regiment of Native Infantry, and used their persuasive powers so well as to succeed in getting the men (wfho were rnostly young recruits, the old hands being away on leave, or on command) to join them. " It is to be spoken to the credit of the men of the 1st Native Infantry, that when they agreed to go away with the mutineers they ffist begged of their officers (who had been for some time in the habit of sleeping in the quarter-guard of the reg iment to insure confidence) to leave them, and ultimately forced them to go away into the intrenchment without hurting them. "This corps left its lines about half-an-hour after the cavalry. As the latter left with a shout an alarm gun was fired from our camp, and tho non-military coxmunnity all taken into the intrenchment from the church compound. Nearly all the bungalows on the vwest side of the canal were that day plundered and afterwards set fire to, so that ther e was nothing but large blazes of fire to be seen in that direction. " At about 7 o'clock a.m. three or four officers went on horseback towards the Assembly-rooms, and on their retnum the 3d Oude Horse Battery was ordered to pursue the rebels, accompanied by a company of European soldiers. These went as far as the canal, but were recalled, owing to an apprehension that the 53d and 56th Native Infantry, who were still in their lines in our rear, might attack us, when the remalning men would not be smfEcient to defend the intrenchment. " The two last-named native regiments showed signs at 9 o'clock of their also joining in the rebellion, and about half an hour after nearly the whole of the native commissioned officers (about 30 or 35 in number) caine to the General and reported that their remonstrances to the Sepoys were of no avail-who had also that morning been tampered with by the cavalry, and appeared determined to go off. While they were yet speaking a bugle sounded, and presently afterwards we could see the two regiments drawn up In colunmns on their parade ground, showing a defying front ; but ashot or two from our long gun immediately dispersed them, and sent them at a fuU gaUop round their lines, cn the outside road leading to Delhi, and branching off to Nawabgunge, where their rebellious brethren were then sta. tioned. " The native commissioned officers were then told to take their position in the Artillery Hospital Barrack, opposite to us, oni the east side, and to make an intrenchment for themselves there, and endeavonr to draw back those of the Sepoys and native non-comuissioned officers, who, they said, were not inclined to go, but were reluctantly compelled to join. These oflicers went awavi with one or two exceptions, and we never heard any more about them ; but I learnt afterwards that, fearing the resentment of the Sepoys, they took the straight way to their homes, and never joined in the rebellion. " Carts were sent at noon to bring in from the Sepoy lines the muskets, &c., of the mlen on leave, and the baggage, &c., of the Christian drummers, who, vith their families, had all comne to seek protection in the intrenchment. The siek in hospital were also brought in, and the two barracks were very much crowded, so much so that the drnmmers and their families and native servants had to remain in the open air at night, and under cover of the cook-house and other buildings during the heat of the day. At 5 o'clock in the evening all the uncovenanted (my. elf and my brother included) were mustered and directed to arm themselves with muskets, of which there was a great heap. This they did,and after receiving a sufficient quantity of ammunition were told off in different sections under the command of several officers, who instructed us as to what we should have to do when occasion required it. " It is reported that when the mutineers reached Nawab. gunge the Nena came out to receive them, and, taking them with him proceeded to the treasury, where he had all the Governmont elephants well ladea. with the public money and while this was being done w ord was brouight that th ether two regiment4s (the. 53&. ad. 6h Satinq Whfatryk
THE DISASTER AT ARRAH. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The columns of 27we Tines have ever been ready to do justice to the gallantry and heroism which have been displayed by all classes durinz recent events in India, but in a letter signed "Indophilus," which appeared in T7e Times on the 24th of October, censure is implied on some who rather merit praise. In alluding to the abandonment of Chuprah and other stations by the civil authorities, In consequence of orders from Mr. Tayler, Commissioner at Patna, "Indophilus" says,- '-Chuprah was abandoned with somewhat more reason, because it was threatened by a strong party of Holnes Inegular Horse. StiUl the flight was unnecessarilv hastened, and had the Comnissiorer's orders not given an excuse to the timid it is probable the station vrould not have been abandoned." The recent mail has brought the enclosed letter from Mr. William M'Donell, magistrate of Chuprah, and, as it con. tains the most graphic account I have seen of the disastrous expedition for the relief of Arrah and of the vaciUation and mismanagement at Dinapore, which mainly caused the disaster, I think you may deem portions of the letter as deserving a place in your columns. As one nearly connected with Mr. M'Donell, I can assure you that implicit confidence may be placed in the accuracy of every statement made by him; and I amsure that those who read this letter will feel that he is not justly liable to the imputation of having deserted his post of duty in the hour of danger. I have the honour to remain your obedient servant. w- TT. r.T\nR A V West Dean-house, Chichester, Nov. 3. " Chuprah, Sept. 3. "On the evening of the 25th of July, or rather in the middle of the night, a note cane from Dinapore, saying that the troops were very shaky, but that Her MIajesty's 10th and the guns were ready for them. Next morning we got an official despatch from the Brigade-offlce, teling us that all three native corps had gone off in a westerly direction (this was at 11 a.m.), and that the 10th were after them. About half an hour afterwards we got a note from Daunt at Peiprah, an indigo factory about 50 miles north of Chuprah, that the 12rh Irregular Cavalry had, on the 23d, mutinled, murdered All their officers and their wives, and had then set off towards Sewan. He said he wrote on the chance of our not having heard it, though it had occurred three days before. On hearing this we held a cabinet council and dete!mined that Chupraab was no longer safe. So, Martin, Richardson, and h3s wife set off at once; the doctor and his wife followed soon afterwards; and about 2 o'clock I was thinking of following them wben I remembered that all my prisoners, owing to cholera having broken out in the gaol, were in the opium godowvn. Now, as they could easily escape from there, I went and saw them al into the gEoL By this time everybody knew that the offidals had bolted, and people seemed so alar,ned that I determined on staying on a little longer. About 6 p.m. I got a note from Mr. Garston, asking if I was in the station, as he heard I was alone. He was returning from the district. I said I was, but I advised him to bolt; bnu, instead of that, he very plackfly came in and stayed with me. We rode round the town, to show the people we had not bolted, and then came home, and went to bed without undressing; and we had our horses, saddled, standing all night at the door. About 12 o'clock that night I got a pencil note, not signed, but written, I saw, by Lynch, saying ho had escaped from Sewan with his lfe, and that the cavalry were there. Early in themorning I got a second rote, saying that the troopers bad come down the Chuprah road searching for Lynch and M'Donell, the depnty-opium agent. About 10 a.m. I heard that the Dinapore mutineers had reached Arrah, and while in cutcherry, about 3 o'clock, a man on a pony canm galloping in saying that the cavalry were within 10 miles of Chaprah. I finished the case I was about, and I fear rather hastily, and then rodehome, and Garstoa and I agreed it was time to bolt, so we made a start fo: it, going through the town, and to the police station, and also to the missioraries to tell them we were going, and advising them to do the same. We rode down to Doreegunge, about eight miles, and saw the smoke of a steamer -in the distance, so we waited until she came near. We found Ma2tin and Richardson and the doctor on board, with a party of the 5th Fusileers and some 13 Sikhs. On hearing that the cavalry were on their way here, and that the rebels were at Arrah, all agreed it would be folly to go hack with onlv 13 Sikhs, so we got s party of the 5th Fuslleers to go with us, and we started off in boats for Chuprah, whioh we reached at 11 p.m. We went tothe collector's, and all assisted inpacking treasure, and we started back for the steamer with some 90,000 rupees. If they had left me 50 man I would have stopped at Chuprah, but not with only 13 Sikbs. As the nien could not be spared back we went, and on the way we heard that the Arrah people, consisting of my friend Wake, officiating magistrate, Littledale, the judle, Coombes, the collector, Boyle, railway engineer, and some six or seven others, were besieged in a smal bugalow by the three Dinapore corps. On reaching DinaporeI found that 200 men of the 37th Qaeen's and 50 Sskhs had hen sent to, relieve Arrah, but unfortunately the steamer grounded, through treacbery, I bellevo, on the part of the piht. There the steamer lay quite close to Dinapore, and the authorlties doing nothing. I went to the General and urged upon him that unless relieved soon the garrison must all *ue murdered, and that if he would send another detachment in boats I could show them another way to Arrah where the steamer was sure not to stick, and that I knew the road from the Gh:;t to Axrah. He said if I wouild really go with them he would send some of the10th. Just-then another steamer came in; it was agreed that all the pa-sengers were to be landed and put into the churchlnrhanrti Xt1tV( ) f thfrs *M + , - +- 2- _1 A _* t A A Wbile making.arraugementsI got a note from Tayler, t3e Commioner, saying he had heerd I hd volanteered. to show the way, bat that he could not spare me; so I at oace got into a native cart at. 10 at night and drove to Pa'na, whichIreachedabo-athalf-pastllp,m. I saw Tayleraend begged him to let mo go, as, humanly speaking, it wav-the only way of saving the little garrison. At last he said. that if the feneral really laid any stress on ny going ho would niiot ohct. He ordered his cariage, and I drov%down with him and young Mangles to Dinapore. It wNv, then nearly 2 o'Clock. We woke up the General, and he told Taylar. that it was very iportan-t that I should go,. as I knew the.road&and be. wrou trusb tam.ne. By this tlmeit was tha hour fixe. to start. M-o drove down to the steamer, and tomy disgust found all the assenzers still on boari.

About two milesfrom ihe Ghd.t there is a rirer, after orossing r,hich ycu get on the public road to A=ah from Chuprab a distance about 12 mfles. As I was not su ce I stould fird boats, as we were in an enemy's countbi, I offered to go on with a small party of Sikbs and seoureAtbp boats while the Europeaus bad their dinner on the b4& So off Ingelby of the 7th 'Native Infantry, who volumtserad, and commanded the Sikh-, Garston, and myself, wit 20 men, went to tho iver Fide. On reaching the river% bank va found all the boats drawn uD on the other 'Ae, and about 20@ men assembled. They had four or 'f5ve of those long native gnns stuck on three sticks, and be-A6 blazing at us, whereupon two of our party sald they ,vould return for aid. We told them particularly not to ".ssturb the Europeans, but to ask for the rest of the F,ikhs, 50 being snfficient to dislodge the enemy. W o immediately set to work and blazed across the river, and 'soon set all the fellows running. Two S* hs then swam across, and got a small boat, in which lngelby, Carston, And myself, with ten Sikhs, crossed. WVe wsre hardly aCer-ss wvhen, to our disgust, we saw all the Europeans con .ng up at double quick, these fools having reported that ve were surrounded ; so the 10th came away without get',Ing their dinners, or even a drop of grog, and had broup'4t nothingr with them. We all crossed, and by the time we here in nmarching order it was 4 o'clock. Ingleby GaRs°t',, miyself, and 20 Siklhs formed the vanguard; then came i:,O of the 10th; then 50 Siklhs; and. lastlv. 200 of the .d7th Queen's, We rmarched four miles all right, wbgn we saw some 10 or 12 horsre.uen in front. Ho*evar, they IelloPed off before any d,arnge could be done to them. he men got very foot-s0re and we baited at the Xaimnugger.bridge, aboout threb miles from Arrah, t 10 p.m., and here we o,lght to have rema-ined for the night, but after H, opping about half an hour on we marched. I fancy poor ) nbar tbought it useless halting, considering his men had not."ing witb tess, and that it would be better to push on. Wha." Po55e5ild us I know not; up to this time we had made the b.I ; throw out skirmishers, but now we marched inabody .In elb and Diubar, who was talking tome, with about 20 Sik'bs, 5io,le .ll yards in advance of the main body. After marching ttJ jitkin half a mile of Arah we arrived at a thick tope of tre ui, and the moonlight hardly showed through; in fact, the moon was settinz. Well, we had got Dearly through. when Zike a fash of lightning all along our left side came one blaze of musketry, and then another, and a third volley. By the light the firing made we could see we were surrounded. We got behind the trees and tried to return the fire; Danur, myself, three of the lOth, and tfo Sikbs got together aDi blszed away. Foolisbly I had given my powderflask and bidlets; &s., to-a native to carry; of couroe he dieappaared, bad afte-, firing off two barrels I was powerless-not for 2ong, however, for the next minute we got a, volley into us. I fancy our ffing slowed where we were. Poor Dunbar *l3 agaimt me znortally wounded. I was covered with hi& bl6od. A ball hit me in the thigh, cuttingi it slightly only; at the susme time two ef the I Oth and onw Siklh alo fell. I iaediately picled up. an Enfield rifle belonging to the lOhk man, and his cartridge- box, and began blazing away. I then shouted out tlat Dhnbar was ldlled p that the first officer i: command lad best give orders. Thiss brought another volloy' on us, and-a2other man dropped. We then tried to join the main body, ad ran from tree to-, tree; the Europeans eeeing. u& consingi al.l Sikhs nearly, thought we were the enemy, and firsd into us, killing - several; in fact, I fear as rsany of our men werv:. killed by their own comrades ashbv the enemy. In the night it was difficult to tll friend frum. foe; and, after having to dodge round a tree, youin the dark could hardly tell where your friends were, and where your foes. At set most of us got together ardt.: beat a retreat towards a tank, near whLich wasa high bank', ve got to the other aide of this bank ar d lay there all night, the enemy firing into us every five minutes; and foohshly our men would return the shot; It was bad policy. it, showed where we were, and we could not afford to threw away a single shot. Young Anderson, a very nice young, fellow of the 22d Native Infantry, a. vonteer,-was standing up behind the hed'ge; he was shot through the head, ahds jumped up like a buck-of courseldlled on thespot. Aboutdaylight we counted our forces, and foundthat we were, about 350 strong, 100 missing ; afterwaids about 50 of thesejoined us, being concealed in a village close by; the rest were killed. We could see the enemy and tried to make out their number; there wera th'e three Dinapore Regiments dravwn up in order, with bugles soundingthe advance. About 2,000 men, with, long matchlocks, belonging to and headed byBaboo Roar Sing, and more than'*. 1,000 of the disbanded Sepoys who had managed to join him, and a large rabble armed with swords, s.4ears,", not formid. able in themselves, but who made themselves useful killing al the wounded, beating them like dogs.' We tried to, -make the men charge, but they were tira,' wet, and a great - number wounded. My leg, from lying cm the damp groundand from the bleeding, was so stiff I could hardy, walk. however, I soon warmed up. Unfortunately, the doctor was one of the first wounded, and, though be-did his best, poor fellow, he could not bind up the wounds properly' There were no Dhoolies, so that the wounded had- to march' vwith the rest. Then commenced our retreat. They completely surrounded us, and fired into uz all the way back12 miles; men dropping every minute, and some, badly' wounded, were, I fear, left behind and kiled by the enemy. By the time we reached the boats 100 must have been hilled and then commenced the massacre. The boats, which we expected to have been taken away, were all there, so with a cheer we all rushed to them, wvhen, to our dismay. we found they had fastened them securely to the shore, and had dragged them up out of the water, and had placed about 300 yards off a sma cannon with which they blazed into us. I forgot to say that all the way they pitched into us with our small cannons.) The men to escape the shot got into the boats, and, of course, as long as they were in them it was impossible to push the boats off. So a number of' men stripped themselves, throvwing away their Tifles -and everything, and some of them managed to reach the' other side. The wounded men, of course, could not swim, and some of us knew we could never reach the shore, so out we jumped and managed to get two of the boats off; well then we were at the mercy oF the wind and stream, for not an oar had they left us. The wind was favourable, and we started off splendidly, iwhen, lo and behold, we-gradually turned tovards the shore, and then I saw they had tied our rudder, so aa to bring us in again. I told the men to cut it, but no onermoved, and soI got a knife and climbed up to the rudder. It was one of those country boats, covered in except just at the stern. The moment they saw what I was at they blazed at me, but God in His mercy preserved me. Two bullets went through my hat, but I was not touched. The rope was cut, and we were saved; butabout halfway aorcas we struck on a sandbank, and then the bullets pourea in so fast that nearly every one jumped overboard, One young officer jumped over as he was, with his sword on, and down he went; another, Ingleby, was shot in the head, and either drowned or killed. I threw my pistol overboard; my coat I had thrown away early in the morning, as, being a coloured one, it made me conspicuous among the soldiers, who were sll in white. H ow I swam on. shore I know not, as it is not an accomplishment I am a 'dab' at. W-hen once on sbore we were pretty sefe, and 250 out of 450 reacbed the steamer alive. Since then nearly 100 more, from wounds, exposure, &c., have died, maeing a loss of 300 out of 450-the worst that has befallenas yet;. nearly every one was wounded. Of the eightvolunteers, who went with the troops eight were khlled, two wounded, poor Gs-ston badly, shotright through the body from hip to hip, myself s!ightly in two places, the thigh ard on tFe shin, the latter cutting my trousers in two places, cuting two holes-in a. Wellington boot, and luckily only cutting dflesh wound. The aigh h volunteer, young Manlees, John Lowis's brother-In-aw, was knocked on the 'ead and stunned for some 10 minutes. He had a greatlump on his head, but the bullet-did nomsnore damage.; it must have just glanced off. This acoount, I fear, is rather egotistical; but it is too late to alter it. I have sincethen been on another exp3dition in. charge of 150 Sikhs, thisasecond timoeas commander. We bhal not much fihting, but burnt several vilLages, more especially the vllage of Behara, where we were so awf'ullypunished. It is just post time, so I m,ust stop. Chuprah is, I trust, now pretty safe. Our only fear is from Lucknow; the bordering districts of Goruckpore and Azimghur have been deserted. The latter, however, is by this time reoccupied- by 3;000 Nepaulese troops, but in Goruckpore there is- no- one. A l.ucknow man, named Mohamed Hassen, has made himself Chuokledar or-Negrim to the King of Oude, and issues orders. EIe has ssomes S,000 men with him, but mostly rabble. One English regiment, or half a regiment, and two guns, would drive him out, whereas now we have to watch him. In another month the-muttny will be nearly over I think. Lots ofwork left in punishingthese brutes, but there wiUl not be any fresh outbreaks. I trust LTclknow may weather the storm, but It is a near business. They have been entreated to hold outto extremities, and not to make terms. General Outramn will' relieve them if he can."
THL TWEZLL iTCAHWpoRE. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIhlES; Sir,-It seems to be generally felt that a Christisn church'. erected over the well at Cawnpore would be, at the. same time, a most appropriate memorlal of the dead and a most striking lesson to the living. It is also felt that its erection should be a national aet. Dut the preponderance of any one denomination r,mong.us izsnot sufficiently decided to entitl0 its forms of worship to beceonsidered national, nor will the proposed church ever answer its full intenticn if it is either Episcopalian or NSonconDzrnm:st. What would be the value or the effect on the native- mind of a building on the very threshold of which either Proteatant or. Roman Catholio snust needs part company vith his fellcw, and go no further? Theisais.but,osa remedy. Let us for..oncehave "a house of prayer for al nations." None bat Christians will *go there to pray. No Massulman or Il4ndoo 'will choose that spok. on. whish to offer his devotions. But let. no Christians be excl.,ded through the operation of sectarian. distinctious. Let them enter. and depart when they will, stand or kneei as they wil, their do- votion. helped, pc&haps, by the consciousne3a that others. are prayirg arouad them, but certaimly not impeded by any comp-alsion to ore preclseQy the sanie words. as their neigh,. bours. By graaping at too much we lose all. By insisting that, whether liturgical cr not, eaoh man9s prayer shall be but the echo c'lthat of s*m,, leader, and put into his mouthb rather than pneceeding Iresh oat of his owa heart in his own words, or no words at all, we aust inevitbly exclude all bat those of our own particular commurion. To catch the centagion dc a devotiDnal spibi it is sePic ient that the spirit be there and obviously animating the worshippers-no. -matter in what torms thek express Kh%enselves, or whether.. *they all wray afteo' precse4 the same Jashion, or. sash in hil own fanhion as he would pray in 41s own chamber.

FOBBIGN INTELLIENCFB. FRANWa (FRoM OUR OWN Co srs DNT.a [The foUowing appeared inl our second Gd&tio3 of yesterday :-] PARIS, TUsDAY, Nov. 5, 6 P.ir. The Union keeps up its controversy with the JAnvrnal des Dibats on the Indian question. It is full of wrath at the more temperate and rational view taken by the Orleanist journal within the last few days. The Diats is charged with time-serving and inconsistency by the Union, the Univers, and the Gazete de France. What the (Inivers says no one is surprised at, and none, save the intolerant portion of the community to which it addresses itself, sets much value on its declamation. The general reader may be struck by the rude energy of style which M. Louis Veuillet occasionally displays, but his in. fluence on public opinion is nulL It Is, however, from the Legitimist and Fusionist press that we must never expect mercy or impartiality. The recollection of favours received and services rendered in other times only makes it more relentless in its hatred-the hatred of ingratitude; its disappointment felt at the turn matters have taken in lIdis it cannot conceal; and, having said all it could against you, it now turns on those who have, however timidly, spoken favourably of you. Whatever be the reason, there is, kaeingular change of tone In the Debats; a new light bas broken in upon it, since the favourable news brought by the last mail overthrows its speculations on our future fortune in India. But it is inostl strange to hear fierce denunciations against British " tyranny" in India from those who crouchl and fawn before the military despots of the day, and who lick the hands which from year to year destroy all their visions; who look on tamely while freedom and independence are trampled under foot, and bow to Mammon as the only God of their Idolatry ; craven-hearted renegades, -who cant about British oppression in India, and utter piteous lamentations because British merchants have not sufficiently preached the Gospel among the heathen, or because they had not placed the Sepoy murderers on an equality with themselves, and had not civllized and regenerated the Oriental races. If we are to judge by establishing terms of comparison we might cast a glance on the condition of other colonial settlements all over the world. 'Where do we see so vast an extent of terrltory ruled by a handful of the conqueror's itroops, minghing as our men did with the subject races, marshalling and drilling them into discipline, and humouring them to the prejudice of that samse discipline? That the practical sense of the British has been at fault ie evident, and England may well bear to be ridiculed for her humane and indulgent weakness; but to hold up her Indian administration to the odium of civilized nations is an abominable distortion of facts. Faults there no doubt have been, but by no means to the extent which might have been expected. Englishmen have the singular desire of proclaiming to the world their own faults and errors, whatever they happen to be. Wherever a grievance exists, it becomes forthwith the theme of public animadversion on the hustings, in the press, in the market-place; and, as our neighbour seldom take the trouble to inquire into the true state of the case, they gldy adopt them, without looking beyond the surface for the good which coexists all the while. To expect anything like candour from a considerable section of the continental press would be visionary, yet a few statistical facts might be afforded which -would modify certain fallacious statements, It might become a question of national honour to show that England has not deserved the hackneyed charge repeatedly put forth even by the rmoderate and philosophlc Debaf;s, namely, that of neglecting the moral and civilizing mission entailed upon her by the Indian occupation. We might produce an account of the various stations and churches erected throughout British India, the number of schools and missionaries throughout the land, the colleges in Calcutta and elsewhere; and, as we have had many allusions to the treatment of the Sepoy officers and men, we might give a summary of the military regulations concerning them, and an abstract showing the number of Hindoos and Mussulmans actually employed in the cvil departments. The Pension List mightalsobe produced,and the charities and foundations exclusively devoted to thenatives. It maylbe t~rue that the annexation of Oude w as a fault, and that the treatment of the Eajabs baa been harshL But has the press of iFrance a right to Mling such a reproach in our faces,-the press of a country which hsas taken Algeria to itself, w hich has portioned out | the land among the conquerors-all for the further advancement of civilization, no doubt, in duetimeandutterly regarcless as to what became of theArab's pasture or grazing lands, or as to where his tent is to be pitched henceforth, when " civilization" shall have completely destroyed his crops, driven away his flocks, and occupied his fields? What does this press think about the moralizing effects of the Bureaiux Arabes, considered as a system,-to say nothing of the noble example of the faith kept with Abd-el-Kader, or the smoking-out exploit of Pelissier some years back? England, it seems, " has never yet asuceeded In irnspiring her Indian subjects with a proper sense of veneration or respect. She has not dealt justly with her conquered multitudes." If the question be considered as one of Christian responsibilty, it is true she might have done otherwise, annd every statesman, soldier, and merchant might have considered hiniself as a missionary. But, taken as a mere member of the European family, and to be judged by another standard, England has no great cause to dread a comparison with any other nation. That the Hindoo and the Mahomedan should strive hard to get rld of British rule is what might have been expected, not because it is more galling tharn any other, but simply because it is, after all, a foreign rule. Where is the conquered race on earth where this species of antipathy does not more or less exist? Can the B3ritish in India be more thoroughly hated than are the Austrians inItaly, orthe Russians in Poland or in the Caucass ? Even in cases where nations have been forcibly joined together by diplomatic agency, as Belgium and Holland, how short a time did they go on together, and with what deadly feuds during that brief union,! We might look across the Atlantic for colonial wars; and as for the supposed beneficent effects of European and civilized dominion over the coloured tribes in general, with all the love and affection supposed to ensue, we need only call to mind the horrors of the St. Domingo crisis some 50 or 60 years ago. The SiMcle contains the following reflections on the causes which oppose the rapid colonization of Algeria:- " The military administration of our colony was an uz. doubted necessity during the entire period of our conquest. But that period has passed, and we do not believe thAt we exaggerate matters when we say that it was incompatible with the development of colonization. This is easily explained; how could persons accustomed to a civil rule, and to all its liberty, confront of fre w all the exactions anadthe ri. gour of a miilitay rule? Why has the stream of emigration fiowed towards America, neglecting fruitful Algerla, which lies at the doors of France? Simply because the colonist know that in America he would meet with free inatitutions and a vast field for his labour and activity. Could we only have offered similar advantages to the immense masses of emigrants who have passed through France on their -way to our ports of the north, the problem of colonization would have long since beon solved. Nothing now opposes the accomplishment of this reform, The recent conquest of Kabylia has crowned the military action in the colony. If we wish to obtain hands for Algeria, If we wish to colonize the country, we must give to capital and to emigration the guarantees which can alone be afforded by a civil administration. As long as the perspectiva of a military rule lies before the eyes of emigrants they will abstain from colonizing Algeria, in spite of the efforts of economists, politicians, journalists, and travellera." Count Walewski, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and M. BiUlault, Minister of the Interior, have returned to Paris from CompiRgne. M. Abbatucci, Minister of Justice, is again compelled to suspend his labours for some time in consequence of the state of his health. It is supposed that he will be not less than a month absent from his official duties. Count de Rayneval, Ambassador of France to St, Petersburg, has now recovered from the indisposition which has hitherto opposed his departure for Russia. The journey of the Count to Nice, which was spoken of, appears to be no longer deemed necessary. St. Benedetti, having returned from his journey to Italy and Corsica, has resumed his functions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the occasion of the opening of the sittings of the law courts the day before yesterday M. Troplong, First President of the Court of Cassation, gave a grand dinner. Among the queets were AL Rouland, Minister of Public -rUOnU9ig t4le Odi- nal Archbishop of Paris, the heads of the magistracy of Paris, M. Dupin, Ex-Procureur.General of the Court of Cassation, and several of the leading members of the bar. Marshal PeliMsser passed part of last week at Tours, where he visited the colony of Mettray and theprincipal educational establishments of the town. At the school of St. Louis the pupils received him with great warmth, which was increased when the Marshal obtained a holyday for them. By an Imperial decree in the Moniteiur General Renault has been raised to the dignity of Grand Cross of the Leon of Honour, General Chapuis to that of Grand Officer, and Colonels Comignan and Legrand to that of Commander. Other decrees make eight promotions to the rank of officer, and 32 nominations to that of knight, and confer 45 military medals upon officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of different branches of the military service.

Renri de Brouck6re did accept the mlsslon to compose a new Cabinet, and the following names were at one moment in circulation as those which would be fotund on his list : -7iedts, Interior; Faidar, Justice; Quoilin, Finance; and Renard, War; MX de Brouck6re himself taking the administration of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The intention was, It appears, to form a Ministry merely for business, to carryon affair until the elections in June, 1858. Since then, M. de BrouckUre, having ascertained from several conferences with members of the Left that such a position would be untenable for any Ministry, found himstelf obliged to inforn the King that the projected arrangement could not be carried out, and that he feared it would be impossible for him to compose a Cabinet. M. de Brouckkre not having been able to form a Ministry, M. Charles Rogier was sent for, and had a long interview with the King. AUSTRIA. (]MON OUR OWN oORWWPONDKs.1 VIENNA, Nov. 3 On the 29th of October business of unusual importance was transacted by the German Diet. After the President (Count Rechberg) had communicated to the august assembly that the port of Canton was blockaded he proceeded to state that a " representation" (vorstellung) had been made to the Bund by the nobles and commons (Bitter und Landschaft) of Lauenburg respecting the protectionl of those rights and privileges which were guaranteed to them both by their Constitution and by treaties. After the "representation" had been laid on the table, the Austrian and Prussian Ministers gave a detailed account of what had passed between their Governments and the Danish Cabinet in regard to the affairs of Holstein and Lauenburg, and concluded their report by declaring "that Austria and Prussia now put the affhir into the hands of the Bund, which would have to take it into consideration, and to decide on what was to be done." After a short discussion, the Diet resolved that a committee should be chosen at the next sitting, whose duty it would be to examine into the matter, and send in Its report on the same. about a fortnight ago you learnt from me that the Hanoverian Government was extremely Indignant at the behaviour of the Danish Cabinet towards Holstein and Lauenburg; and you will, therefore, be the less surprised to learn that the representative of Hanover made a separate motion to the following. effect.-1. That a committee of the House do examine into the obligations whichDe-nark has, according to the federal law and to the negotiations of 1851 and 1852, towards Holstein and Lauenburg, and that the said committee do state whether such obliga. tions have or have not been faithfully discharged. 2. Should it appear thatimportant obligations have not been discharged, that the Danish Government may be requested to fulfil them, with the accompanying remark, that, if it should not do so within a given time, all those ordinances and arrangements in Holstein and Lauenburg which are contrary to the federal law and to the engagements entered into by Denmark will be declared invalid (uxvtrbi/ndZih) both for those duchies and for the German Confederation. The committee, which will be chosen at the next sitting, will have to report on this important motion. As has already been said, the French and British Governments are inclined to interfere in the quarrel between Denmark and Germany, but it appears to me that they will have no right to do so as long as the regal rights of Denmark in Holstein aud Lauenburg are strictly respected. The Russian Government is not likely to meddle in the matter, because it is aware of the exact state of public feeling in Germany. Austria, Prussia, Hanover, and the other Federal States are of opinion that they have been treated with contumely by Denmark; and Russia is much too prudent to run the risk of forfeiting her influence in Germany by openly giving her support to the Danish Cabinet. She besides knows full well that the German Confederation is anything but an aggressive Power, and that the worst thing likely to happen, should Denmark remain obstinate, will be that Hanover, and perhaps Mecklenburg, will receive orders to send 4,000 or 5,000 " troops of execution" into Holstein and Lauenburg. The KreuzZeitung espouses the causeoftheDuchiesmuchmore strongly than anyAustrian paper, and the reason why such is the case is obvious. The aristocraticelement is preponderant in Holstein and Lauenburg, and as a matter of course it has the sympathy of the " Junker' party in Prussia. The RPitterachaft in Hanover also makes common cause with theHolstelners, and it is probable that the Hanoverian Government would have less zealously supported the Duchies if it had not been urged to action by the equestian order, which is as infiuential in that kingdom as it is in Prussia. A German politician of great experience has advised me not to attach any great importance to the Holstein question. " The Bund," says he, "was never intended for offensive purposes, and is by no means likely to create a disturbance in Europe. The world is accustomed to sneer at it, but there is not a more useful Power iu the world. By its vis i.erR,- it is to Europe what the 'buffer' is to railway carriages. It deadens the force of political shocks, and X, besides, a natural wedge between France and Russia." The Imperial ordinance respecting the newspaper stamp has led to a controvery in this city. No one knows what interpretation to give to Para. V'aph 5 of the Ordinance, and even the Osbt- Deutsche Post contradicts to-day what it said a few hours ago. We were yesterday told that the postage must be paid on newspapers, in addition to the stamp duty, but to-day the Ost-Dettsche Post Is inclined to believe that it did not properly understand the sense of the Imperial decree. The fact is that the sentence may be construed in half a dozen different ways,and the Finance Department will be obliged to state in plain German what is meant. The style of the ordinances and rescripta which are from time to time published is often so obscure, that Government has repeatedly been obliged to givesupplementaryexplanations and elucidations. In respect to the abovementioned paragraph some reliable information has been acquired. It applies only to the foreign news- papers, and consequently the Austrian journals will have to pay stamp duty and postage. The new ordiance will in no way affect the non-German papers, which already pay a stamp duty of two kreutzers (or nearly one penny English) per copy. The German (non-Austrian) papers will have to pay the new stamp duty of one kreutzer per copy. The state of the money-market is still extremely un- satisfactory, and many houses of respectabifty are greatly inconvenienced by a measure which has just been taken by the Credit Bank. That etablishment, which has advanced a million to the creditors of Boakowits and Co. and is about to lend a milion to the Theiss Railroad Company, is in want of ready-money, and has demanded payment from those persons who have obtained advances on Government and private stock. The stockjobbers inveigh bitterly against the Credit Bank, but dispasBionate persons are of opinion that the first duty of that establishment is to care for the interests of the shareholders. On the 1st inst. the Protestant churohes in Vienna celebrated the festival of the Reformation with great ceremony. According to the papers, all the sermons preached "breathed peace, Christian charity, and respect for other confessions." The churehes, which were crowded to excess, were brilliantly illuminated, and " Bine feste Burg ist cnser Gote' (" A strong fortress is our God") was sung by all the congregations. The Calvinists, on the same day, sent in the various sums which had been collected in their places of worship towards the construction of a monument at Worms in honour of Martin Luther. The Augsburg Gazette learns from its semi-official Milan correspondent that the reduction of the Austrian aarmy has been resolved on by the Emperor. At the beginning of the Imilitary year" (it began on the lst of November) all the depOt battalions of the regiments of the line will be done away with, and the third battalions will, in future, raise and drill the recruits. The companies of the infantry regiments, which will becomposed of three battalions, will consist of 80 men, instead of 120, as they do at present. As the amy in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom will, when so reduced, hardly be strong enough to perform the customary garrison duty, an infantry regiment will be sent as a reinforcement from one of the German provinces. The reduction of the army in Italy alone will amouat to 25,000 men, and no fewer than 30 Generals Will be put on the pension list. The strength of the regiments in Ancona and Bologna will not be diminished. It is calculated that the above-mentioned reduction will lead to a saving of 50,000,OOOil. a year, and it Is rnot doubted here that the measure in question is a consequence of the meeting of the two Emperors at Weimar. The Emperor Alexander has presentedto the Emperor Francis Joseph five copies of a magnificent work, containing dravwings and descriptions of themost ancient and remarkable buildings in Russia. The inundations in Lombardy have greatly subsided, but in several places the Po has formed an entirely new bed. The damage done by the water is imrmense. Thousands of acres of the finest meadow land are so covered with sand that they wil be barren for years to come, and large and most exzpensive dikes have been completely destroyed. The communication with Modera and Parma is not yet entirely restored. The loud complalnts of travellers and the stern remonstrances of the Imperial authorities have produced some effect on the clerks of the Lombardo-Venetlan Railroads, and people travelling between Venice and Milan can now calculate on arriving at their destination at the U"me mentioned in the wav-bills.
AMEBrCAN CAPTAINS AND BBrTISH SEAMEN. Another case has occurred at Snnderland of a murderou. attack upon Bzitish seamen by American captains and their chief officers, and as they sailed away ere they oould be overtaker. by British justice, the facts have been sent to Lord Clarendon for submission to the American Minister. The following is a copy of the depositions made by the men and forwarded to Lord Clarendon .- " George Telford, of 13, Mallng's-rig, Sunderland, North sea pilot.-On Friday, at 11 a.m., I was engaged by Cnarles Brookman, the master of the John U. Broolkman bark, of the port of New York, and then lying in the roads, laden with a cargo of coals for New York, to pilot the vessel to the Downs or the Orkney Islands. About 3 p.m. I went on board the vessel in company with the ,master. We took a coble and two coblemen. There were also three BritishI seamen, who had I believe agreed to join the vessel, as the crew was short of hands. Captain Brcokman told me he was two hands short, even with the three men. The vessel is about 500 tons. There was also a Jew on board, who had got the three seamen. When we got alongside, the Jew and the three seamen, the captain, and myself, all got on board, leaving the two coblemen in the coble. I put my things into the cabin. The Jew came into the cabin and reoeived, as I thought, 91. lOs., his charge for getting the men. The Jew wert into the coble. One of the three men said that the ship was ahort-handed, and they did not wish to proceed. This was said to the captain. The captain, without saying a word, knocked the man who had spoken down. He used his fist. He said to the man, 'D-vyour eyes, go to your w ork.' The captain then seized a small axe, when I got hold of the axe and goa myself cut shghtly. I got lt out of his hand. He then seizd a hammer and felled another of t three men down. 1 went aft and called the coble to the side, as I was deter. mined not to go in the ahip. When I looked round I sawv one of the three men in the water. I called the coblemen to take him in ; they did so. The captain said to me that he would not allow the coble to come alongside to take me in. I called them to come under the stern; they did so, I then slid down a rope and got into the coble. When I last saw the deck of the vessel the other tw., seamen were lying on the deck wounded and bleeding. I was afraid of my life, and would not go in the ship. The captain was assisted by his three mates in the illusage ta the two sailors. Two of the mates had each a belaying pin in their hands. I don't know the names of the two seamen ; I never saw any of the three before I saw them ia the boat. " Peter Mitchell.-I am 19 vears of age. I came up from Aberdeen to this port on the 29th inst. I was on FridaI forenoon shipped by a Jew for the John Brookman, at St. a-month wages. I got 30s. in advance. Another seaman, named Alexander Irving, was shipped at the same time. I did not see the third man shipped The captain was in ths Jew's shop atthe time I was shipped. I went on board, as the pilothas already stated. Before we started from thl dock the captain told us he would get two other hands ia addition to us three. When we got on board Irving wen' into the cabin and I at first followed, and then went forward to the house on deck. In a short time I came out, and thea I saw the captain knock Irving down. I saw the captain with a weapon in his hand, and I saw him strike Irvingwith it. Irving fell; I saw him bleeding from the back of the head. He got up. I went to the othor side of the vessel and there I saw the mates striklng the third man, whose name I did not know. Saw the mates knock that man down, and saw one of the mates strike him when down oa the face with a ballast shovel. I went round to the other side, and the captain came up to me and was about to strike me with a belaying pin. I then jumped overboard. I am no swiimmer, but I w as afr3id of my life being taken if I remained on board. I was picked up by the rnenin the coble. I left all my clothes on board, and the ship sailed wvith them."
THE CRIMEAN ARMY FUND. TO THE[ EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having seen in your journal of the 13th of October that it was your intention to assign the balance of the Crimean Relief Fund to tbe governors of the new military hospital at Netley, and not having observed in your paper any objection froru correspondents raised to the plan pr )- posed by you, it has struck the officers of the Invalid depUt and myself that the interes of the above-mentioned balance, or some portion of it (with your sanction, or that of the governors when appointed), might be most usefully expended on deserving objects of the invalid establlshment which will continue at Chatham until the completion of the new building at Netley. I conclude you are aware that the general hospital of the British Army, and the barracks for the reception of invalids from our Indian, Colonial, and Home stations, constitute at present an important part of this large garrison, and will very shortly be crowded with our sick and wounded soldiers from abroad; and long ere the hospit3l and barracks at Netley will bo finished a host of objects, men, women, and children will exist in Chatham garrisoa as worthy of our deep interest and corpassion as any upon whom the funds in question can at any future time be bestowed. In the course of a few months the sick and wounded of those regiments stationed in India at the time of the octbreak of the Indian mutinies, and who have borne the burden and heat of the terrible confliot, wiU find their way to this garrison, accompanied by many women and children, and I think the public and yourselU will agree with me that many objects can be selected from among them most worthy to be recipients of the interest of the 7,0001. Permit me nowt to mention a fewf instances where assist. ance can be tost appropriately rendered. 1. The wives of those soldiers who are In the general hospital, and who, while there, are under stoppages of lOd. Per diem. 2. 'The widows of those who die in the general hospital, and vho at once are deprived of all means of support. 3. The case of infectious or other diseases breaking out among the wives and children of the invalids, necessltsti'g their removal from the barracks, and the expense of a lodging in the town. 4. To provide a lodging in the towFn for w omen on the eve of their confinement, and to prevent the inconvenience of its occurrence in the barrack-room.ec 5. To afford aid, under particular circumstances, to the nen themselves. With these remarks, and this enumeration of oase, I would beg to be allowed to suggest that the money might be most judiciously employed in assisting soldiers and their families on arriving at Chatham, and before their discharge ; at a period, too, of their service when their circumstances make the strongest appeal to the sympathy of the public; and to carry out this purpose I would propose that a committee be formed (until the governors of the Victoria Hospital at Netley be appointed) of the authorities of the garrison, to receive the interest of the money and to distribute the same at their discretion. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient -.,,- CHiAgUWE3 GEEEN, Chaplain to the Forces. unsanam arrison, Nov. u. IM-ENSE NUGGET.-We had on Thiidy the satisfaction of inspecting an Immense nlugget from the Australlan mines in the shop of Mr. Muirjead, goldsmith, Buchanan-streeL This nngget weighs 400o0., ws of pare gold, without any apparent admixture of quart, and is in the condition in which the lucky digger discovered It. It ij valued at about 1,6004, is the largest but one ever brought to this coumtry, and is certainly a Curiosity worthy of the inspection of the citirens. We believe It will remain oa view for a few days.-Glasgow Daciy Mail.
MONEY-MAlRETandOITYIITELLIGpNOB. Friday Evening. The funds have been fairly maintained to-aay. They opened with a very unsettled appearance at a decline of g per cent., but there was ultimately a recovery; and, although after regalar hours a reaction from the highest price again took place, the market presented no appearance of general weakness. The first quotation of Consols for money was 87- to 88, the two days' later news from New York by the Vanderbilt having created a feeling of discouragement, but the public made investments, and a rally soon occurred to 88g. They then went to 88, from which they once more recovered to 88 to i, remaining at that point up to the official close. Subsequently it became known that the Bank returns would exhibit a reduction of 1,330,5251. in the notes unemployed, and of 872,0141. in the bullon, and a tendency to heaviness was again manifested, some transactions being effected at 88i to i for money, and 881 to X for the 7th of December. The recent sales of stock by the Bank have nearly equalized the rates in the Stock-Exchange and discount-market, and 8i per cent. was offered to-day for advances on Consols from account to account. Bank Stock left off at 209 to 211; Reduced, 871 to i ; New Three per Cents., 8k to #; and India Stock, 210 to 213. The increased value of money has considerably affected the market for the unfunded securities, and India Bonds were quoted 50s. to 40s. discount; while Exchequer-bills declined on sales to 25s. to 15s. discount. The applications for discount at the Bank of England to-day were numerous, but no difficulties transpired in London. The transactions in foreign stocks have been limited chiefly to Mexican, Spanish, and Turkish, which show no recovery from the late depression. The market generally is quiet. French Three per Cents. were negotiated at 66j; Guatemala, 50; Mexican, for the account, 181, 19, and 18;| Spanish, 40i; ditto, New Deferred, 265, i, and S ; for the account, 25A, i, and i c ditto, Certificates, 5; Turkish Six per Cents., 86E and for the account, 86&, g, and 1,; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 96k, i, i, and -; and Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 94. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was a general advance, the principal rise being in the rates on Amsterdam and Hamburg. The corn-market was steady this morning, at the rates of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited and difficult business, at a further fall of {d. per lb. About 14,0001. in bar gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day. 35,000 sovereigns were also taken for exportation to Lisbon, where the exchanges have been unfavourably affected by the interruption to business caused by the recent fever. It is stated that a deputation of Glasgow mer- chants and millowners is about to proceed to Lon- x don to ask the Government for measures of financial relief. If they are able to define what they wish to be adopted, and it should appear consistent wfith any principles of public honesty, there can be no doubt It will receive full attention. The difficulty is to conjecture the probable nature of the demand. It cannot be for a reduction In the rate of discount, since while the rate is 9 or 9i per cent. in Hamburg, 12 per cent, in Vienna, and 36 per cent. in New York, no one would suggest that the Bank of England should lendj at a lower rate than 9, unless they wished to see every ounce of gold drained from the country and a national bankruptcy as the consequence. Neither can they oontemplate requesting that the Bank should dlscount more liberally. Not a dngle sound bill has yet been rejected by the abkk, nor is there any probability that such will be the case. Such an application would therefore simply be a request in another form that they should be compelled to discount unsound bills. Neither can it be for any enlargement of the ciroulation by means of an issue of one-pound notes, or any similarl device, on the plea that the existing amount is not sufficient for the commercial wants of the country. Trade has undergone contraction in all directions, and there has been an enormous fall in prices, yet the aggregate of notes shown by the Gazette return of this evening to be in the hands of the public is nearly a million in excess of the total In use in June, 1856, when the rate of discount was only 4i, and the increasing magnitude of our transactions was a daily subject of surprise. None of these grounds being avaUable, it is to be presumed the deputation will simply solicit the Government to promise that the Bank shall not be allowed on any sudden occasion to destroy the commercial community by refusing accommodation at any price. If this should be the case, as there is not and never has been the remotest danger of such an event, the Chancellor of the Exchequer can have no difficulty in giving the required assurance. Whatever may be the views of the deputation, it is above all things essential they should be prepared to state them specifically. This is a duty they owe to their fellow-traders. The present is not a time for any body of men inconsideratelY to create alarm by a vague clamour for impossible aid, and thus, by complicating the existing distress, to paralyze those who canbe saved only by the exercise of mutual confidence and self-possession. We have been exposed to difficulties more sudden and extensive than any nation was ever before called to sustain, and the way in which they have been met must be a marvel to the whole world.I There must have been a cause for this result, and It will be found in our currency system. It therefore behoves all to beware how, by endeavouring to weaken the public faith in the working of that system, they may change our calm and dignified course into one of imbecile confusion. The market for silver is fiat, and it seems that the disposition to send gold for purchases on the continent has greatly subsided. The following communication from an experienced source embraces most of the points in the question as to the probable results of the shipment oEf specie to India now in progress:- i '"Sir,-Concurrhng entirely in the sound and practical viows contained in several of your money articles on the present dearness of money and its causes, particularly in reference to that of aUl others the most disturbing element of the crisis-our Indian finances and exchanges-it may not be out of place at this critical moment to remind shippers of bullion to India that the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances which prompted an exchange of 2s. 34d. when the last mail left Caloutta must have ceasel to exist long before any bullion now shipped can reach its destination. IWith the fall of Delhi and the arrival of European troops native confidence will be at once restored, hoarding must cease, and the shroffs and native bankers will be the first to bring their buried money to markot on the advantageous terms offering. Merchants will have no occasion to draw bills at arbitrary rates of exchange, being no longer deprived of ordinary facilities at the Bank of Bengal and in the open market, and it will be found that, in addition to this, important element in materially reducing exohange, an equ?Uy powerful reason wiilt exist in the fact that, in quantitJ and price, a very^ serious reduction must take place in all the leading staples of export from India. 'Rice, linseed, saltpetre, hides, jute, and hemp, which in the last few years, particularly since the outbreak of hostility with Russia, have commanded nearly double their ordinary value in India, must fall to a like extent to make their importation at present market prices here remuneratUve. Silk, sugar, and cotton, which by reason of the faillure of these crops in important countries of p"roduction in 1855 aud 1856 bad also materially advanced In Ind.4a, are no, fast falling in value under the in'duence of abundance. Tboe1 only article which has increvased in value is indigo, which from short supply will only absorb the same amount of money as in average years. - o these causes have also to be superadded others equally important. English capital has since April last been restricted in its use in the interior of India in the production of staples for shipment. All available river and land freight will almost entirely, to the exclusion of merchandise, be absorbed by Government, and it is not unlikely that these causes alone may bring about the exchangea of 1848 and 1849 In India, whici were Is. 10d. and Is. lld., and necessitated bullion shiprments from Calotta to a large extent, influenced entirely by the restricted exports,of staples which the failures of 1847 caused in reduced means and facilities of production. " It should also be borne in mind that a rate of exohange in Calcutta of 2s. 3d. In October has, even in the absence of any of the above causes, frequentlv brought about a fall of 16 per cent., or a rate not exceeding ls. lld., as ia March, 1S52, when bullion shipments from Calcutta were again revived, four months after the rate was 2s. 3d. "There might have been some reason and justification for the export of bullion by the Court of Directos in June, July, and August, when it was expedient and desirable to inspire confidence in the native rind; but there is neither reason nor justification now, when the fall of Delhi and the arrival of the overwhelming reinforcements must have given more confidence to the people of India than they ever had in our power and means. ",A more judicious and extensive ciroulation In our treasuries in the interior of India of the Bank of Bengal notec might have saved us mach tresure which has faUen into the hands of the mutineers; and now in the support and transport of our troops on arrival in India native princes and zemindars should, on the paper of the East India Company, be required to find the neoessary means until bullion circulates as before. "There is no scarcity of bullion in India; it has absorbed from this country some 40,000,0001. slnce 188, when we were importing it from India ; allthatisrequiredis a strong and determined Government. " I remain, Sir, your obedient servant, "Nov. 6. " ALWY And the following, also from a practical merchant, strengthens, by a reference to the last advices from China, the view thus taken:- " I enclose two Shanghai eircular, by which you will see that large amoUnts of golA and silver are being sent from China to India. This is a startling and eudden change. For five years China has been dratning us and India of the pre. dous metals, and now the reflax seems beginning; it seems to me to indicate not merely a change in the balance of trade, but a return of confidence and a restoration of quiet. There is no doubt that the Chinese in the north have been doing an enormously profitable business for years past, and great accaumulation of wealth must have followed. Roarding from this would seem to have been checked. "The probabilitynow is, following the present position of the sUk and tea markets, that the balance of trade may soon be against China. The increased values of opium and goods :i China may contribute to this ; if, then, we find gold aDd sUver retnrned to India thence, and silver, as is pretty certain, ceases to go to China, it may be concluded that the requirements of Inlta wUI be supplied from China, andthat tie drain of 15,000,0001. per annum of sUver to the East, whIch has been hitherto oppressing us, wiU cease. Already it will not pay to Bombay, and only to Calcutta does the drain continue. It remains to be seen if China will supply this. I think it wilL The conclusion I come to is that before long you will find the drain of sUver to the East cease almost entirely, and if gold is no longer required to buy it we shall have no other external demands on us beyond what Armerica may require for a time. That cannot be muoh, whiIe before long it may be assumed the flow of gold wiU be the other way. "If the future Is to be measured by the continuance of the silver drain to the East, I should say many months canndt elapse before there will be a rapid and very considerable fall in the value of money. " Enormous amounts of silver have been sent to Chins, Singapore, &c., for sugar during the past eight months; all this wll cease now,-another source of relief. "Yours truly, " G. N." The produce-markets during the week haye exhibited extreme depression, which increased towards the close in consequence of the advance in the Bank rate of discount to 9 per cent. Continued arrivals from America have also tended to weaken confidence, and, although most of the principal articles have been offered at a further heavy fall in prices, the tr-asactions generally have been upon a most limited scale. Sugar is neglected, notwithstanding the reduction of 4s. to 5s. established during the week. The lower descriptions have now nearly reached the prices current during the years from 1852 to the close of 1855. A large cargo has arrived from New York, and, additional heavy suppies being expected, buyers have for the time lost all confidence. Coffee, which on Tuesday was rather more in request as regards plantation kinds, was exceedingly dull to-day at lower rates, only a sniall proportion of the quantity brought forward meeting with buyers. A cargo of Rio for the Baltic has realized 42s. Stocks at this as well as the chief continental ports are steadily Increasing. Rice has been little inquired after, with occasional sales for cash at a further depreciation. Floating cargoes appear to be held more firmly. Nearly al kinds of spice are dull and prices drooping with the prospect of imports from America, The business in saltpetre has been upon a very limited scale at fuly 15S. to 17s. under the highest quotations paid during September. Fine Bengal has been sold at 48s. to 48s. 6d. per cwt. The stock is still rather large. The tea-market partakes the general depression. Both by private contract and in public sale, a few speculative holders being determined to realize, a considerable reduction in prices has occasionaUy bean submitted to. Importera, however, are generally firm, and the greater portion of the recent arrivals has been entirely withdrawn from the market. Common congou has been disposed of for cash at a price under ls. per lb. A special meeting was held this afternoon of the Netherlands Land Company, Mr. T. Moxon in the chair, for the purpose of considering the financial position of the undertaking, and to give the directors new powers to raise money. Since the meeting in July last a call has been made upon the ordinary shares, which has been very inadequately responded to, and none of the 12,154 preference shares roposed to be issued have been taken up. ln their negotiations with the Dutch Government the board, however, have been more successful, and have obtained an extension of one yearto the 1st of January, 1860,-in the time fixed for the completion of the canal works. A protracted discussion took place principally upon the heavy expense the company haad incurred in reclaIming the Erabbendyke polder, and the engineer explained that this arose out of their undertaking the works themselves, and from the subsequent mismanagement of the superintendent. It waa stated that a tender had been made to enclose a polder of 1,000 acres for 13,5001., or 131. 10s. per acre (on the E:rabbendyke the cost amounted to about 401.O), and that in future all works will tbe executed by contract. It was resolved, finally, to issue 16,000 obligations of 101. each, with 7 per cent. interest; that in the sale of land the obligations may be tendered instead of cash; and that these last may be reissued only in the event of the additional enclosures being made equal in quantity to the land so disposed of. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 31st of October gives the fcUlowing results when compared with the previous week:- Public Deposits £... 5,160,918 ...

In addition to the above the Gazette also contains a Bank return up to the 4th of November, being the first published under the new plan for giving the Bank returns to the WVednesday instead of to the previous Saturday.

The total I decrease in the bulion since the return of the 24th of October when compared with the return of the 4th of November is therefore 872,0141. Oncomparingthis last return' with the lowest period in the year 1847 it appears that the present reserve of notes is 978,5751.; and the present stock of bullion is 185,0S91. greater than their respective amounts at that time.

The first section of this line from the harbour of St. Andrew's to Barber Dam, in the forest, a length of nearly 40 miles, was opened for traffic on the 1st nlt. The event was celebrated at St. Andrew's and other places on the line in every way worthy of the occasion. A special train started from St. Andrew's about 10 o'clock in the morning, conveying 600 persons, aud on arriving at the Frsdericton-road station stopped to take up the provincial secretary and the surveyor-general. The train then proceeded to Barber Dam, where it arrived in about two hours after leaving St. Andrew's. An excellent dinner was provided in the principal marquee for 400 persons, at which the Hon. Captain Robin. son presided. Loyal and other toasts were given and responded to, and the proceedings terminated in a most satisfactory manner.
RAILWAY AND MINLVG SHARES. Friday Evening. The railway-tnarket has fluctuated with the funds and closed with little alteration. The tinal prices at 4 o'clock show a slight improvetnent in London and North-Western, Midland, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and Great Western. South-Western, Berwick, South-Eastern, Caledonian, and Eastern Oounties, on the other hand, fractionally receded. Itldian desCriptions leave off rather worse, and a fuirther deelineof 11. took place in Grand Trunik of Canada; Great Western of Canada were a shade weaker. A general reduction oecurred in French, but only to a slight extent ; Southern of France exceptionally close without alteration. In Amaerican securities Illinois Central again receded, the shares being now quoted 12 discount. A fall of 10s. took plac in Canada Government Bonds. The transactions in mines were limited, and show no variatiou of importance. Joint-stock banks were flat, and City, Australasia, and the Australian Chartered banks leave off at a reduction. Miscellaneous securities were rather actively dealt in; Peel River and Crystal Palace Preference slightly declined, and there was a recovery in English and Australian copper. PRICES OF SHARS.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CEHNCERY, Lumcor's-.n Nov. 6. (f Aflflpw V -rtnx,- - (Before the LORD CflANCELLOR.) This part-heard appeal frora a decree of Vice-Chancellor Xindersley, dismissing the bill rithout costs, was this morning resumed. The short facts of the case were that in the year 1847 the plaSntiff, then a solicitor at West Bromwich, entered into an agreement for the working of some coalmines in partnership with the defendant. Subsequently the coal-mines, which were in lease to the defendant, were assigned by him, and eventually sold. The object of the suit was for an account of the partnership earnings and for payment to the plaintiff of his moiety of the partnership property. The evidence respecting the terms of the agreement was conilicting, and the nature of the whole case, it will be seen, was of no interest except to the parties themselves. Mr. Glasse and Mr. C. Hall appeared for the appellant the Attorney-General, Mx. Freeling, and Mr. Pearson sup. ported the decree. The arguments were not concluded at the rising of the Court. (Before the LolDs JursTics of APPEAL.) IN BANKRUPTCY.-EX PARTE BIRtCH, In RE THE WELS! POTOSI LEAD AND COPPER MINIG COMPANY his was an appeal from the decision of Mr. Commissioner - Fane, who, on the application of the official liquidator of the above named company, had placed the name of the petioner, Mr. Edward Birch, on the list of contributorles in respect of certain shares. It appeared that the company was formed in 1853 for the purpose of working the Esgairbrin and the Esgair-fraith lead and copper mines, in Cardiganshire on the costbook system - the capital 100,0001., in 20,006 shares, limited by the second rule of the coetbook to 51. each. The company conducted business up to June, 1857, when it was registered as a *' limited" company under the provisions of the Joint-stock Companies Act, 1856 (19 and 20 Victoria, cap. 47), for the purpose, as was stated, of preventing the directors from incurring further debts and liabilities in respect of the mines. Mr. Commissioner Pane, at the Instance of one Mr. George Bulton, a shareholder, made an order for winding up the company under the above Act in July last, and on the 29th of August he placed Mr. Birch upon the list of contributories. Mr. Birch's case was thus situated :-In April, 1857, before the com any was registered, he relinquished his shares in so. cordance with the 10th rule of the costbook, which pro. vided " that any shareholder may at any time determine his or her responsibility or liability with respect to the affai-s of the company and the working of the mines utpon his or her giving notice in writing, and signing a rel{quishn ment of all claims and demands," &c., in a certain fo and which was well effected and the surrender was accepted By the 63d section of the above-mentioned statute it is enacted " that a shareholder in a limited company, who has ceased to be a shareholder within one year prior to the commencement of the winding-up of the company, shall be deemed for the purposes of contribution towards payment of Jhe company's debts to be an existing shareholder, and r aubject to the same liabilities to creditors as if he had not so ceased to be a shareholder." Mr. G. M. GiFFARD was heard in support of the appeaL Mr. SELwyN and Mr.IRoOXBIRUGU appeared for tne respondent. The former had proceeded at some length with his argument, when Lord Justice TuHNEn said he looked upon the question to be of so much importance, involving as it did in one view little less than the repeal of a statutory provision, that he considered it to be better that the opinions of the full court should be taken upon the case. Lord Justice KNIGuT BRuCE added that perhaps that would be the naore satisfactory course. If the case should be deemed so important that the Lord-Chancellor would consent to sit with the Lord Justices to hear it, it was to be remembered that only one counsel on each side would be heard. LOPTOUSE'S CASE, RE THE SAME COMPANY. This case is also directed to be heard in the same manner. Mr.Bacon and Mr. Doria, Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Roxburgb, are the counseL
ROLLS' COURT, CAcEy-TiAqx N,v I- VI - - A 1 -vm. .- (Before the MASTER of the RoLLs.I Mr. WA&LY applied in this case for an ex parte injuue- tion, under the following circumstances :-In the year 1842, and subsequently, a Mrs. Witcher lent a friend of hers 2001. or 3OOJ. upon the security of some copyhold property. In 1847 this person died and left the property in question to his wife. In 1850 the wife had obtained from Mrs Witcher a loan of the copyhold deeds deposited with her, in order to carry out some arrangement as to the property and the wife, as alleged, had refused to return the deeds to Mrs. Witcher when requested. A foreclosure suit had been commenced against the wife, and the present application was to restram any present dealings with Mrs. W;tcher's security deeds. His Ho-NouR reflused to accede to any ex parte application of the Idnd, on the ground that it was wholly unnecessary to apply ex parte, and that an Injunction in such a case could only be entertained on the usual notice to the other side.
VICE-CHANCELLoRs' COIJRTS. Nqv A IN RBE TIF.ADTVrNn'Q -rT,U (Before VTice-7Vancaor Sir R. T. KD\-sRR.i This was a petition for payment out of court of asum of 5001. which had been paid In under the Trustee Relief Act, and the only question was as to the costs, the petition praying that the party who had paid in the money might pay the costs of payment in and out. It appeared that the Rev. enry Hollowav was entitled to the sum in question wnder the wiil of Wlliam Olement Headington, dated in 1819, in remainder, and before the legacy fell Into posges. sion,-namely, in 1840, he had assigned all his property to trustees for the benefit of his creditors, and had'become insolvent. When the money became payable upon the death of the tenant for life in 1857 he gave notice to the surviving executor of the will, Hugh Parnell, not to pay over the money to the trustees of the deed, or to any one - upon which, after some correspondence, Mr. Parneli paid the fund into court under the Trustee Relief Act, and the question was whether he was justified in so doing, and tberefore entitled to his costs. Mr. Glasse appeared In support of the petition; Mr. Speed appeared for Mr. Parnell. Mr. GLAssE was heard in reply. The VICE-CHACELLOB, after referring to the various cases which had occurred under the Trustee Relief Act, establishing the jurisdiction of the Court to compel trustees to ay costs, observed that the Act was obviously passed to ena le trnstees to relieve themselves from any responsibility, but, on the other hand, the trustee was not justified in acting from a capricious or worse motive, with the object of vexation, annoyance, or oppression; and the Lords Justices had expressed themselves very strongly in such a case. EHis Honour then referred to the facts of this case, and said that Mr. Parnell had not, as it appeared to him, either acted from an improper motive nor miscarried in point of jddg. ment, and was not bound to enter into any question as to the title of Mr. Holloway, or of the assignees of the deed, or in insolvency. It was a bond fide case of responsibility from whioh he had a right to relieve himself; he was therefore entitled to his costs. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) FORBES V. FOBBES. The object of this suit is to establish a trust in favour of he plaintis late husband and his family as to certain assts in the hands of the executors of the late Sir Charles The facts are extremely complicated, and relate to a long series of partnership and mortgage transactions between the firm at Bombay, of which Sir Charles Forbes was at the head, and a firm of Inglis, Forbes, and Co., in which the plaintiff's late husband, Michie Forbes, was a partner. The material question in the suit arises upon a " Reserved Interest Fund" in respect of certain estates in Java, which had been the subject of mortgage transactions between the two firms, the plaintiff contending that, by virtue of expressions contained in letters and other documents, and the rules of equity applicable to the subject, a valid trust as to onethird of the balance of the above-mentioned fund had been created by Sir Charles Forbes in favour of Michie Forbes and hi8 family. The plaintif'.'s case only has been heard at present. Mr. Belt and MIr. Archibald Smith are for the plaintiff; the Attorney-General and hr. Schomberg for the principal defendant; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Nugent for other defendants in the same i.nterest with the plaintihf.
COT nF nn'T.RN DvNyT - A- --I.- (Sittings in Banco, before Lord CAMl}BELL and Justices COLERIDGE, WIGITMAXN, and ERL?,) Mr. EDWARD JA-MFx Q.C., moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict which had been found in this case for the defendant should not be set aside, and a new trial granted, upon the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. The plaintiff was a barrister, and he had sued the defendant, a gentleman at Beverley, in Yorkshire, to recover damages for slander, imputing to the plaintiff that he had committed felony. At the trial, which took place before Mr. Baron Watson at the last Yorkshire assizes, it appeared that the plaintiff had taken some part in the late Beverley election in opposition to one of the candidateg, Mr. Glover, against whose roturn a petition was presented. A meeting of Mr. Glover's friends was held to consider what should he done in reference to this petition, and at that nmeeting the defendant made use of the slanderous words complained of. He referred to the plaintiff as connected with the SZu4 newspaper, and described him as 6 feet high and with " felon stamped in his features." After again referring to the expression of the plaintiff's countenance in similar terms, the defendant said the plaintiff was " beneath contemupt," and was " a man who deserved to be serat beyond the seas." The only defence was that the words were not used in the sense supposed, and that the defendant had no intention to impute felony to the Lord CAIAPBELL said there was great reason for believing that the words did not impute a felony. Mr. JAzmEs said that though in terms the question had been left to the jury, the learned baron had made some observations which, the learned counsel suggested, had prejudiced the plaintiff's case. His Lordship told the jury that they e ld not know who the plaintiff was, that the case arose out of a Beverley eleation squabble, and that no particular felony was charged. Lord CAMIPBELL said there was no ground for the inter. ference of the Court. The learned baron had left it to tbe jury to say whether the words did impute a felony, accordimg to the innuendo in the declaration, and the jury thought they did not. He (Lord Campbell) thought they had put a reasonable construction on the words, and that there was no ground for disturbing the verdiot. The other judges concurred. Rule refused. Having disposed of all the motions for new trials, the Courtproceeded with the cases in the special paper. SILVESTEB V. I1AMPSON. This was an appeal from the decision of the judge of a County Court. The action was brought to recover the sum of M. as damages for an Injury done to the plaintiff's mare by the alleged negllgenco of the defendant, who was a horse trainer. The plaintiffs mare was aged 16 years, and had hunted eight seasons, and was placed under the defendant's care, with instructions to prepare her for the next season. The plaintiff directed the defendant to give her *' plenty of work," and hopd to see her "fit to ran for her life." When delivered up to the plaintiff the mare was lame in both her fore feet, and her legs were swollen, which the plainti's witnesses thought could only have arisen from violent exercise. On the other hand, the defendant contended there had been no negligence. The mare had been allowed to gallop only on one occasion; once she had leaped over a bar two feet high, and once over a quickset hedge into a field. The judge decided in favour of the plaintiffr and awarded him 401. damages, being the value of the mare ,when she began to hunt. The questions submitted to the Court were, first, whether the instractions given to the defendant to give the mare plenty of work, &c., did not amount to an indemnity; and, secondly, whether there was an evidence from which the judge could conclude that the deendant had been guLty of negligence. Mr. MtLISH 'was heard for the appellantk and Mr. CoxoN for the respondent. Lord CAPNBxLL having been absent from the court during a part of the argument, as one of Her Majesty's Commissioners for the prorogation of Parliament, said he should not give any oplo n. Mr. Justice COLE=xGE said he was of opinion, on the first question, that the letter did not amount to an indemnity; and, upon the second point, considering that the question was not whether there was any scintilla of evidence, but whether there was any evidence upon which the judge could " reasonably" have come to the conclusion that there had been negligence, his Lordship thought there 'was not such evidence. Mr. Justice WiGaT5L&Jx took the opposite view of the question, and thought that there was evidence from which the judge might come to that conclusion, though his Lord- hip 'would abstain from expressng 'hether or not he hims-ef 'would have come to the same decision. Mir. JCuOstired E. concurred 'with the opinion of Mr. Jdgment 'was thereupon given that the.plaintff shouId be PnnVUsGt FROM ABBb. Mr. MrTwARD moved for, a rule to show cause 'why a person who had been arrested while in the act of giving evidence before an arbitrator should not be set at liberty. It appeared that Mr. Denman, the barrister, was sitting as arbitrator in the vicinity of this court, and while the plin. tiffin the action was under examination he was arrested by a sheriff's officer, who refased to bring the party into court, but insisted on taking him away to prison. The COURT granted a rule nisi, returnable at the sitting of the Court in the morning.
COURT OF COMMON PT.i'. AR NT-A o RANSOM AND ANOTMR V. THE EASTRN COUNTIES 'RATT.RAV rA u I vv (Sittigs in Banco, Michaelmad Tearn, before Lord Chief JustiCC COCKBURN and Justice, Wm tA?, CROwDEIP, and WiLLEs.) Mr. T. JoNs moved for a rule calling on the defendants to show cause why a writ of Injunction should not Issue against them to restrain them from charging higher rates of toll to the applicant than to other persons on their railway, under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act. It appeared that a similar appllcatieh had been made before against the same cornpany by Mr. Ransom, and a writ had issued. But the aprncant now complained that the company had divided their railway into distriots, In each of which they charged a certaintoll, the effect of which was to evade the former rule, and to place the applicant under the same disabilities as before. The app cant is a large dealer in seaborne coal at Ipswich, and this coal comes into competition with the inland coal; and, as the latter coal traverses a greater extent of the defendants' railway, it is an object with them to encourage the traffic in it, and to throw obstacles in the way of the seaborne coal, which has only to traverse theirrauway from Ipswich. The coat of carrying a ton of seaborne coal fromlpswich to Bury was 2s. 5d.,whereas the cost of bringing a ton of inland coal from Bury to _pswich was only 4d. From Peterborough to Bury was 74 miles, and the charge for carrying a ton of coals that dis. tance was 4s.d, and to carry the same ton of coals to Ipawlch, 27 miles further, was only 4s. 7d. Rule nisi granted. BNsrnErr V. HRRI2G. in this case Mr. EDWARDS showed cause against a rule for a nonsait. The action was an ejectment for breach of a covenant in a building lease of certain houses to repair the same. The lease contained several covenants, one of which was to finish the houses in a certain time, and another to keep them in repair. Some of the houses were never finished, and continued as careases, and the evidence was that they were in a dilapidated state, and the plaintiff recovered on the covenant to repair. Mr. HoN YmAN, in support of the rule, contended as the houses were never finished the covenant to repair them did not apply. The CoURT were of opinion tbat it was quite clear the covenant to repair had been broken. Rule discharged. BUSnSxsS OF THE COURT. In the course of the day it was announced by the COURT that on Monday week and Thursday week the Court will hear appeals from the decisions of the revising barristers. On Wednesday next the Court wivl not sit, their Lordships being engaged In the Exchequer Chamber. (Sittings at Nisi Prns, at Westminster, before Mr. Justice CREsSWELL and a Commmon Jury.) This was the first day of the first sittings at Nist Prius in Michaelmas Term. The list comprised five causes, the first of which was SAMMONS V. AD&MS. Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Charnock appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr. Francis were counsel for the defendant. This was an action brought by the plaintiff, Mary Ann Sammons, to rec*ver damages from the defendant under the following circumstances :-On the 3d of February, 1855, Mr. Adams, who was at that time an upholsterer carrying on business in Leicester-square, called early In the morning at a coffeehouse kept by the plaintiff in Churchcourt, Strand, and demanded payment of his account due for furniture supplied to the plaintiff. Mrs. Sammons said that she had paid him some money a few days before, and that if he would wait she would see if she could let him have a fur. ther sum. He, however, with the assistance of a number of men whom he had brought with him, burst open soveral doors, seized all the goods in the house, took her off to the police-office in Marlborough-street, and on her return in the afternoon she found the house completely stripped of its contents, and even the gas-fittings torn from their places and the gas escaping at every point. On the cross-examination of the plaintiff It appeared that sbe had dnring the past five or six years changed her residence somewhat frequently. She had lived in Foley-place, in Hampstead-street, Fitzroy-square, at the Great Tom in Oxford-street, in Pimlico, and Hart-street, Covent-garden. She had been tried at the Old Bailey on the charge of having obtained goods by false pretences from Mr. Alsop, in St. Paul's-churchyard, and had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment; but after having remained in prison for 11 months had been " honourably acquitted." Her conviction had been obtained by periury, and 50g had been given to witnesses to appear a2gainst her. A man named Harmmond, who is now transported, gave evidence on the occasion. She was asked whether on former occasions she had not been compelled to return goods to tradesmen from whom she had obtained them, and in answer to this question proceeded to give a most voluble description of the numerousacts of persecution of which she bad been the victim. The evidence given by the plaintiff having been to a certain extent corroborated by other witnesses, by her daughter, a little girl, who said that sbe was ordered out of bed and that as soon as she got up the men took down the bedstead, by a Mr. Mlyers who was pre. sent when the defendant came to the house, and by a man named Forrest, who was then in .%dams's employ, Mr. Serjeant BALLANMINE addrcsoed the jury for the defendant, and said that Mrs. Sanimons was t-he most unfortunate woman in the world; that wherever she went there seemned to be a conspiracy to inijure her. In Pimlico she had been obliged to return goods to the person from whom she had them; in Norton-street she was prevented from entering the house by the police ; in Foley-place she had been mistaken for the landlady, and had got into trouble about two pianofortes; and eventually she had most unjustly been tried, found guilty, and sontenced to be imprisoned for two years for obtaining goods by false pretences. The learned serjeant then proceeded to state the case for the defence, which, as proved, was shortly as follows :-In January, 1835, Mrs. Sammons went to the shop of the defendant, who was related to the Messrs. Maples of Tottenham-court-road. and who had just set up for himself in Leioester-square. Sho bought a few articles, for which she paid ready money. She was afterwards suppled with more, for which she paid by instalments, and eventually he trusted her to the amount of about 651., on her promise to pay him by the intervention of " a friend in the Teinple" in a few days. The defendant said that if she did not discharge the debt within a given time he should fetch his furniture back. To this she assented, but refused to sign an agreement to that effect, on the ground that she was unable to write. She, however, called several times afterwards to inquire if "the friend from the Temple" had brought Mr. Adams a check and also to induce him to give her further credit for furniture for a house which she had taken in Hart-street. He refused, and no money being forthcoming either from Mrs. Sammons or the Temple friend, and hearing that she was disposing of the furniture in Church-court, he took a van and eeven men to her house and carried off what furniture he could find remaining from that with which he had supplied her, amounting in thewhole to about S01. worth of property, a portion of the lasttand unpaid for pareeL Altogether Mr. Adams had sold to the plaintiff about 651. worth of goods, for which he had received no payment, and what he recovered was worth about 301. No doors were broken open, and no gas-fittings touched by his direction. ft was suggested that some of the discrepancies between the evidence given by the plaintiff and that given by the defendant might be explained by the fact that soon after the latter arrived at the house of the former he gave her into custody, that they were both absent during the whole day at the police office, that it was not until nearly 5 o'clock in the afternoon that the charge was disposed of by the dismissal of Mrs. Sammons, and that during the absence of both parties other persons had removed goods from her houEe. She swore most distinctly that when she came home the house was bare of furniture, and that 1201 vworth of property had been taken, and Mr. Adams stated as distinctly that he had only taken such portions of his own goods as he could find, and that the value of such goods, as invoiced to Mrs. Sammons, was not more than 301 After a careful summing up by Mr. Justice CRESSN ELL, The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on the issue of "NottGuilty-" for the defendant on aiL the other issues. This is virtually a finding for the defendant.
COURT OF EmCHEoUER. FRIDAY. NOV. I- (Sittima in Ranrn I Mr. SiKnEBx moved to set aslde the verdict, which paassed for the defendant, at the Stafford assizes, before Mr. Baron Martin, on the ground of surprise, that improper evidence had been admitted, and that the verdict was against the evidence in the cause. The action was for criminal conversation with the plaintifl's Wife in the beginning of 1853, and the defendant called two witnesses who proved that 18 months before the action was brought they had witnessed gross ituproprieties between the wife of the plaintiff and one Bridgewater, a lawyer's clerk. This evidence was received after objection made on behalf of the plaintiff. The learned counsel now contended that the evidence of those witnesses was untrue, as Bridgewater was prepared to prove; and thab baving been improperly received his client was entitled to a new trial. Ar. Baron MARTI stated, that he used to think that it was proper to allow these actions, but that this trial had satisfied him that the Legislature had rightly abolished them. He was clearly of opinion, at the end of the plain. tiff's case, that a good speech for the defendant woald have got the verdict, and at the end of the case he thought the jury ought to have given a verdict for the plaintiff for one farthing. mr. SKirN,ER thought that that view of the case ought to entitle him to a rtle for a new tr2aL The CIaIzF BAto.N.-If the learned judge reports that in his opinion a verdict ought to have been given for the plain. tif, but with one farmLing only, 1, for one, should not disturb a verdict for the defendant in such a case. I have no doubt the evidence of incontinence on the part of the plaintiff's wife was admissible and that there ought to be no rule. Mr. Baron MARTIN was of the same opinion. It was entirely a question for the jmyto saywether the defendant was guilty, and if EO to assess the damages. If s6new trial were had Brldgewater could only swrear as he had already done. The plaintiff's wifo wsas a very bad character, and tetre wvvastsitronog ground for the notion that this was Bridge. water's action. ~ ~ wa The rest of the Court concurring, Rule refused. BI5IBG V. HARLEY AND PLAXTER Mr. HAwNiS moved for a new tril on the ground of misdirection by Mr. Baron Martin at the Middlesex sittings after last term. This was an action for wrongfully seizing the doxikey and cart of the plaintiff in mistake for that of his brother, against whom the defendant Harley had obtained judgment in the Bow County Court, the other defendants being the' high bailiff and his follower, who had made the seizure. The question was whether the officers of the County Court were entitled to the protection afforded by the County Court Acts to all officers acting In execution of the Acts. No notice had been given, nor had this cause been laid in the proper venue, nor was itbrought within the time stipulated for by the Act. His Lordship, however, had ruled at the trial that the officers were not entitled to protection, inasmuch as they could not be acting in execution of the pro,cess issued by the Court when they seized the ;oods of a stranger, and a verdict passed against them for 8g., the defendant Harley being acquitted, as he had no part in the alleged Illegal acts of the other parties. The COURT, after much discussion, granted the rule as prayed for.-Bule ufit granted.
PREROGATrVE COURT. FRxnAY. Nmv A D AVTFSV V.V .A\ 'R (Before Sir J. DODsoN.) This was a business of granting letters of administration of the effects of Morgan Mlorgan, who died intestate and a bacheldor on the 4th of August, 1856. The suit was pro. moted by Ann Davies, one of the sisters of the deceased, against another sister, Eleanor Evans, who had taken out letters of administrationin the diocesan court of St. David's, and the question was whether those letters of administration were valid, or whether the diocesan court had no jurisdiction to grant them in consequence of the deeeased having died possessed of bona s4otabi4e out of the diocess. The d eeased was a mariner, and owned shares in various vessels registered at the port of Cardigan, in the diocess of St. David'os his death having taken place at New. port, in Monmouthshire, in the diozess of landaff and it was alleged on the part of the promoter of the suit that at the time of his death a sum of 61. was due to him from one Elinor Jones, of Newport, a washerWoman. The shares and other property of the deceased having becn sold by the administratrix it became importnt to the purchasers to ascertain whether she had acted under proper authority, or whether letters of administration ought to have been taken oat in this court. A large body of evidence was laid before the Court in support and in contradiction of the allegatlon that the debt of 61. was owing to the deceasedat the time of his death. The property of the deceased had been sworn under 3001. he case wva argued by Dr. Deane on behalf of the promoter of the suit, and by Dr. Spinls for the administratrix. The learned JUDGE, after expressing his regret that so much money should have been expended in litigation respecting this small amount of property, said that the deceased died In the diocess of Laandaff, and it was alleged that at the time of his death he was pos. sessed of bona noinbitia in that diocess. The evidence upon that point was very conflicting, but even if ths 6. in question was in the possession of Elinor Jones at the time of tse death of the deceased it appeared that it had merely been confided to her for safe custody for a night. Under these circumstances the money could not be treated as a debt in considering the question of the jurisdiction of the diocesan court, but must be treated as money in the possession of the deceased. Then, as the deceased died in itinere, and the ship of which he was master and part owner belonged to the diocess of St. David's this Court would not interfere with the letters of administration which had been granted by the Court of that diocess. With regard to costs, as in his opinion there had been an unnecessary expenditare in bringing various matters of minute detail before the Court, the promoter of the suit would not be condemned in full costs, hut would pay 30 guineas somine expensarum.
COURT OP BANKBUPTCY, Basing7w,&strec4 Nov. 6. IN RE OCTAVE FOA. (Before fr. Commiisioner Go1rn m: I The bankrupt was a merchant of Old Broad-street. He came up for a certificate on the 28th of July. The evidence then given in reference to the bankrupt having obtained double advances on a bill of lading appeared in The Times. An adjournment having been ordered, the bankrupt now renewed his applcation. The official assignee reported that the bankrupt's accounts commenced on the 1st of January, 1855, with a capital of 11,0281., and closed with unsecured creditors, 22,5341.; creditors holding security, 19,6001; and assets for the unsecured creditors not exceeding 1,5001. It will be recol. lected that the valildity of a charge against the bankrupt of having been guilty of a preference depended upon the hour that certain letters were rece{ved. A letter from an officer of the Post-office was now pat in to show that the letters had been delivered at such a period of the day that the bankrupt must have made the payment in question preferentially. It was alleged that this was done in order to cover the offence in respect to the double advance on the bill of lading. It was also lleged thatto effect the payment the bankrupt had improperly obtained a large quantity of tin (9001. worth) on credit, and upon which an almost immediate advance was obtained. For the bankrupt, it was now urged that he had borrowed on the 18th of February from his brother-in-law about the same amount (2,0001.) that he had paid on the 23d of February to Messrs. Bischoffheim and Co., that his payments inl the month of February had amounted to 25,0001., and included various sums of considerable amont between the 23d and 28th of February, on which latter day the bankrupt suspended oayment. It was admitted that in the matter of the double advances the bankrupt had been guilty of grave irregularity, and that the foulest wrong would have been committed if Messrs. Bischoffheim and Co. had not been paid the amount they advanced, but that payment having been made, it was urged that the bankrupt ad purged the offence, and tbat he was entitled to an immediate certificate of a high class. His EoNout said he would defer his judgment; he could not, however, do so without observing that the bankrupt had been guilty of one of the grossest and gravest offences that a merchant could commit. It was urged by Mr. Lawrance on his behalf that the offenc vwas purged as against creditors. He (the Commisaioner) thought that the public had an interest in the matter, and could he, as a judge sitting in a mereantile court, hold thatan offence had been purged because, after the double advance had been obtained, a brother-in-law had been found who had made good the amount? There was a great deal in the case to eXcite commiseration. Up to a very recent date the bankrupt's conduct was without reproach, and it was much to be regretted that he had been betrayed into an offence inconsistent with his duty as a merchant. He would go through the depositions, and give his judgment on Saturday, the 14th, at 12 o'clock. Mr. Murray represented the assignees, IX BE COPLrAUD MND BARNES. The bankrupts were provision merchants of London and Southampton. Their debts are 35,0001., the assets being about 6,0001. In the event of legal proceedings of the Royal Mail Steampacket Company resulting adversely to the estate the bankrupts' losses by victuaUing contracts for their ships will have been 27,0001. This was the certificate mneeting. MWr. HIughes, from the office of Messrs. Linklater, and r. Bagley, instructed by MIr. Linklater, appeared for the assignees; Mfr. Lawrance appeared for the bankrupt. After soume discussion the bankrupts elected to take immediate certiScates of the second class, in preference to au adjournment and the prospect of receiving first-class cer- ifIcates. The COMnSSSIO.SER took occasion to remark that the bankrupts had conducted themselves with honesty and uprightness, and that they left the court without any impeachment upon their characters. (Beforc Mr. Commissioncr Ev.s5.) IN BE SIR SAIMUEL 1BANCOCK. The bankrupt is described as a cattle dealer, of Emmets, Kent, and also trading as a druggist in the firm of Williams and Co. His debts are said to be about 8,000!., his asset, about 6,0001. Assignees were now chosen.
INSOLVENzT DXBTOR. COUBT, Nov. 6. T2C R1E a A RV A- -nrRTT:T*1 (Before Mir. Commissfoner P}mLL1PR I This insolvent was a dressmaker and mi1liner, in Daviesstreet, Berkele square, She had filed a petition, and had applied to be lerated on bail until her hearing. ar. G. Lwis, of the firm of Lewls and Lewis, sked leave to make a statement concerning this caee. The schedule which had been filed was whoUy incorrect, and therefore the insolvent could not ask to be released upon it. He had been called upon by the insolvent to assist her in her application to this Court, and had learnt from her the history of a gross conspiracy to deceive the Coart. The attorney upon tho shedle was 3r. Olive, of 47, Portsmouth-street, Loncoln's-inn-fields, who was alao the attorney issuing the writ for the detaining creditor, Mr. Levison. The insolvent declared that she did not owe Levison one farthing, and that five names in the schedule, purporting to re%resent her debtors, were entirely fictitious. she learned ComsromNE suggested that X. Olive should be invited to be present. Mr. LEEWS said he had given Mr. Olive notice on the prevous day of his intention to make a statement to the urt, but he would proceed to that person's office and endeavour to see him After a short time Mr. LEwis returned and reported that Mr. Olive was not at his office, and another visit at a subsequent period was equally unsuccessfuL A person in court named Villiam Price stated that he was a lerk to Mr. Olive, but was not instructed to attend upon the present occasion, nor did he know anything of the matter. Upon a certain letter boing shown to Prioe, he said it wan not in Mr. Olive's handwriting, and he could not tell whose writlng it was. The letter which had been sent to the proposed sureties purported to come from Mr. Joseph Olive, 47a, Portsmouth, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and stated that having learnt that It was the intention of the insolvent, upon being re. leased upon baill immediately to quit the country, the writer tboght lt only right to acquaint the intending sureties of that fact. Mr. Commissioner PHrsLitps said it was a remarkable communication to come from the insolvent's own attorney. A lady who had been the insolvents partner said she knew the letter to be in the handwriting of one Wheatcroft, a clerk of Mr. Olive. The learned CommmoN-x then called up Price, who, upon being pressed, admitted that to the best of his belieE the letter had been written by Wheatcroft. The Cosn'ssIoBm said somo statement should be made upon oath, as the imputations made were Tery serious. The insolvent and her partner were examined. According to their evidence, in March last a Madame Levison, a ward. robe dealer, called upon them to purchase some soiled goods. They were then in some difficulties, which circumstance they communicated to Mrs. Levison, who thereupon recommended an appeal to this Court, stating that her husband would be the detaining creditor. The offer was not then accepted by the insolvent, and an arrangement was temporarily effected with her creditors. About three woeks since she wvz again pressed, and upon a renewal of Mrs. Levison's advice she signed a judge's order, and was the next day arrested at the Peacock pubilehouse, in White. cross-street, for an alleged debt due to Mr. Levison. The schedule was prepared by Mr. Olive, who had received 16!. on socount of his services. Mmr Levison recommended that fictitious names should be returned as debtors to the estate in order to account for the goods bought in the business, and at the same time to keep the real debtors from the knowledge of the insolvent's creditors. Acoordingly the names of persons sid to be in Australia, India, New York, and other distant places were inserted in the schedule by Mr. Olive, who, however, was not told by the insolvent that they were untrue statements. The books of the business had been taken away by Mrs. LeAion, who said they had better not be taken into court, and she had also got posesson of duplicates of property pledged for 201., besides 3! given upon & promise to redeem some articles, all of which she retained. She also took away some furniture to rotect it from the Court, as she stated. The insolvent said Mr. Olive had asked her for more money in addition to the 161. already pd, and she had toldhim she could not swear to the schedule hat had been prepared, and that sbe should consult Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, whereupon Mr. Olive sald it was of no use to consult those gentlemen, the deed was already done. She had never said she intended to leave the country. Mr. LEwss asked that the case might be adjourned for a week and in the meantime a summons to issue calling upon Mr. live to attend and answer the imputations that had been made concerning him. The learned COMnIUSSIONiER said it was clear the petition could not stand. There were some very serious matters connected with the case, which required and he hoped would receive explanation. It was strange how Mr. Olive could write that his client intended to leave the country, when neither she nor her partner had ever thought of such a thing. At the same time it was obvious that Miss Christian had lent herself to the false statements which were intended to deceive tho Court. Mr. LnvIs admitted that she had been weak enough to allow herself to be persuaded to consent to those statements being made, but it was right to add that as soon as she learnt that she would have to swear to her schedule she refused to persit in them, and applied to their firm (Messrs. Lewis an lAdis) for advice. The case was adjourned until Thursday next. (Before Mir. Com4nfssioncr MuprHY.) IN BE RICE&RD OUSELLy. Mr. REED applied that a petition for protection in this case might be fled, notwithstanding the insolvent had not resided for six months in England. The insolvent, a major in the East India Company's service, had come to this country about five months since as agent for the King of Oude to assist his interests In an appeal to the British Government, but the course of events in In dia having led to the imprisonment of the Elng at Calcutta, the supplies from that quarter had been cut off, and Major Ouseley was under the necessity of seeking the protection of this Mr. Commlssioner MuRP}HY said he could not interfere at present. The Protection Act required that the petitioner should have resided for six months within the jurisdiction of the Court, and, as that was not the case with Major Ouseley, the petition could not be received.

MILIlPARY 1A D.NA VAL INTBLGBENCE. Yesterday m',rning the 2d battalion of the 7th Royal PusiIeers, n'.mbering nearly 150 men of all ranks, left Chathasm for Preston under the command of Captain G W. Wallace Carpenter, 1st battalion. The whole of the volunteers from the Royal Marine Light Infantry companies to the Royal Marine Artillery wil leave head-quarters, Chatham, this morning for Portsmoath, together with the volunteers from the Woolwich division. The Heron, 12, Commander W. R. Trascott, fitting at Chatham for the coast of Africa, is still in the hands of the shipwrighte. The following officers have taken up their commissions :-Lieutenant T. H. Collingwood; G. P. Heather, Master; Charles H. Carpenter, Mate; H. Jssber, Acting-Assistant-Surgeon; and Sir Lambton Loraine, Midsbipman. Yesterday an order was received at Chatham garrison from the War-office, directing Colonel H. Jervis, in command of the Ist battalion, and Colonel R. N. Phillips, commanding the 2d battalion, to hold in readinegs the following reinforcements for India :-23d Royal Welsh Fusileers, 20 non-commissioned officers and men: 35th Royal Sussex, 18 men; 53d Regiment, 19 men; Ghlt Rogil ment, 15 men; S4di Regiment, 12 men; and 90th Light Infantry, 25 men of all ranks. The whole of these rein forcements have been Instructed in the use of the llini6 rifle, and will embark at Gravesend on board the George Marshall, 1,000 tons, for Calcutta. Recraiting for Her Majesty's service and for the East India Company is going on in the Liverpool district in the most prosperous manner. Colonel Bell, the inspecting field afficer, sent to their respective corns last month 1,550 recruits-all fine young men fit for service-and a like number may be expected for November. Great numbers of young men are being thrown out of employmerLt, and-they are aIl flocking to the standard. Cornelius O'Brien, private in the 18th Royal Irlih Regiment, who escaped on Tuesday mornig from the guardroom in Chatham garrison, where he was confined previous to receiving 50 lashes for various acts of theft, was recaptured before he had been many hours at liberty. The seiatence of the court-martial was carried out on Thursday, and O'Brien Is now in the hospital, still a prisoner. Htis escape will form the subject of a second trial. No orders have been received at Chatham for the removal of the 3d battalion, which, in the absence of LieutenantColonel Sanders, is commanded by Major Darroch. The head-quarters of the 8th (King's Own) Light Dragoons arAved in Dublin on Thursday from Dundalk. Dublin garrison is at present composed of the Roval Dragoons, the Grays, and the 3d Light Dragoons; the 2d battalion of Coldstream Guards, the 16th, 30th, and 55th regiments; the Southdowrs and City of Dublin militia; one troop of horse arilery, and a field battery.
THE IINDIAN MUTINY. The following is the best account which has yet been published of the important buttle of Nujuffghur:- " One of the most brilliant actions in the present campalgn took place on the 25th inst. (September) at Nujuffghur, about 20 miles from the Camp at Delhi, of which I propose to give you a brief account. Information was received In camp that a force of the enemy, to the number of 7,000 of all arms, with 18 guns, had marched from Delhi, with a view of crossing the Nujuffghur Jheel Drain, In order to operate on our rear and cut off our supplies. A moveable column, under the command of BrigadierGeneral Nicholson, was ordered to march on the 25th inst.,at 4 a.m., to Nujuffghur, to cheok such a movement. This column consisted of a squadron of Lancers, under CaptainSarel; the Guide Cavalry, under Captain Sandford; Her Majesty's 61st, under Colonel Renny; 1st European Fusileers, under Major Jacob; Coke's Rifles, Green's 2d Punjab Infantry; Major Tomb's troop of Horse Artillery, and that comnanded by Major Olpherts; the Mooltan Horse, and a party of Sappsrs and Miners under ant Engineer officer, for the purpose of blowing up the bridge at Nujuffghur, making a total of about 1,000 Europeans and 2,000 native troops. On arriving at a viae some nine or ten mDes from camp a halt was made for the purpose of reconnoitring the road and gaining information of the enemy's movements and position. A cavalry picket was discovered some distance a-head which tried to Intercept our reconnoitring party, bet did not succeed. From the reports of the villages we heard that the enemy had crossed the bridge and were encamped or were prenariug to encamp at Nujuffghur. The march was immeciately resumed, and after a further ten-mile march (in the course of which we had to cross an extensive sheet of water about three feet deep) arrived at Nujuffghur at half-past 5 p.m. Here we found a sharp fire of musketry end light guns directed on the advanced column which was halted there. Brigadier-Gereral Nicholson then gave the order to the 1st Europeans and (1st Foot to form line, and addressed a short speech to them, pointing out how in the Crimea the gaUant 93d and other regiments achieved such brilliant successes by the careful reserve of their fire until close to the enemy, and exhorting the men In the present instonce to emubte that example. A troop of Horse Artillery formed on either flank of this line and galloped forward, and openred fire on a serai which the enemy had occupied in force, with four guns in position. At the same time the word was given ' line wiUl advance,' and with fixed bayonets the whole stopped off as steadily as if on parade, straight on to the seral. When within a short distance the charge was made, and with a British cheer they rushed forward and captured the building with its four guns, doing great execution among the defenders. The enemy beaten from here retreated towards the bridge, several other guns being taken en route. They again attempted to make a stand at the brsdge, but were speedily broken by a welldirected fire of artillery, and four more guns were taken here. A company of the 1st European Fusileers were now sent to hold the bridge as a covering party, while preparations were being made for blowing it up. The enemy had managed to carry off two or three guns, from which they opened a well-directed fire on the bridge of round shot and grape, one of the former blowing up an ammunition waggon which had been abandoned by the enemy, severely injuring several men of the 1st; two were also killed by round shot. They, however, managed to hold the bridge in spite of this very heavy fire, nor did it deter the Engineer officer, Captain Geneste, from laying his charges for destroying the bridge. Several times the enemy tried to recapture the bridge, but the Europeans, now increased to three companies, managed uniformly to repulse them. Unfortunately (through some mistake, I suppose), the grog for the mnen had not arrived, nor Commis. sariat rations, and it was wonderful how they bore up against the privations of a long march, some hard fighting, and no food. A little grumbling was occasionally heard, but good humour and cheerfulness were the order of the day. About 2 o'clock at night the charges were laid and everything ready; accordingly the covering party was withdrawn to camp, and some minutes afterward the explosion took place. On visiting the bridge next morning it had comnMletely disarpeared, leaving, literally, 'not a wreck behind.' his wlll, believe, effectually prevent Pandy again attempting to harass us in rear. AU the baggage being behind, the men had to sleep on the damp ground during the night, at least such as could sleep at all, many being employed in dragging in the captured guns; very large stores of ammunition, &c., were destroved, 10 or 12 waggons being blown up, no carriage being available ; some of the regiments were fortiunate enough to find some bags of rupees, one man 1 heard of having managed to get 900 rupees. Coke's Rifles and the (lst lFoot suffered much, I am sorry to say, in an attack on a village, the commanding officer of the former, Captain Lumsden, being kiUled, and two officers, Lieutenants Gabbett and Elkiugton, of the latter. We marched homewards next morning at 4.30, reaching the half-way house at about 12, where we halted for two hours, and then to camp, where we arrived very tired, but in high spirits at our success, at 6 o'clock. Our loss was estimated altogether at about 120 killed and wounded. Thirteen guns were captured, and great loss inlicted on the enemy."
,9R HENR Y LA WRENCP. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TLUES. Sir,-The British public are hardly yet aware of the real extent of the loss of such a man as Sir Henry Lawrence at the present timue. His s'atesmanlike and miUitary foresight was at least equal to the gallantry he always displayed in the field. The following extract from a private letter will be read with interest:- " The revelation that wil soon be made if Lucknow be relieved will certainly raise Henry's reputation higher than it stands even at present, for all will feel that to him its successful defence is mainly due. Six weeks before the outbreak there were no more defences about the Residency or its magaine than about a house In an EDglish gentleman's pars; hut Henry was not new to this le-be system, which prevails through India as at home, and among his first proceedings on t,aking up hw pest at Lucknow was that of putting the Residencoy into a defensihle state, The de fences wrere afterwards much added to, but what would havne abeen othhe sas te of things there had an ordinary man Your obedient servant, K. T.
GENERALWIVLSOx.-At a dinner at Becles, Suffolk, to commemorate the fall of Delhi, LieAitenant.Colonel Wilson gave the following interesting sketch of the career of his brother-, General Wilson :-" Although he has hitherto hd no Earopean reputation, he has not been unknown in India. In 1819, at the early agea of 17. and before he had completed his military studies, the Indian Government being in want of Artillery officers, he was sent to Bengal. Having there completed the practical part of his education, he was employed in various parts of that large empire until the siege of Bhurtpoor, int 1824. where he commanded a battery of heavy guns; and from the efracienit manner in which they were worked, aud the exection done, he was publicly thanked by Lord Comibermiere, and also receivedl a medal. Shortly after this be was appointed Artillery staff officer in the iNeemuch division, where he remnained several years. He was afterwards appointed saperintendent of the foundry at Calcutta, and it is a curious fact that most of the gunis employed by him against the enemy during the siege of Delhi, as welf as tihose used by the enemsy against us, were cast by him when holding that appointment, and bear his namne. In 1842, after an absence of 24 years, he visited his native country, and remained here about two years. On his zoturn to India so highly was he thought of by the Government for the time being, that he was immediately appointed Adjutant-General of Artillery, anappointment which he held until the last Punjab war broke out, when he relinquished it to take command of the artillery in t.he division of the late lamented Sir If ugh Wheeler. For his services on that occasion he received a seeund medal. At tb.e conclusion of that campaign he again returned to thiE countrv on one )ear's leave of absence. On his second return to India he was appointed colnn.andant of AeZi pry in' Bengoa, gid was alst nLade Brigadier of hleerut,"
fRELAND. (B3OX OUR OWN COBRESPONDaM)TA DUBLIN, FiuDAy llorxo. THIE ORAGE SOCILTY. A little light was let in on the proceedings of the Grand Lodge at a festive gathering the other evening of the worshipful Alderman of Skinner's-alley. Mr. Edward Grogan, ALP., one of the guests, althouigh " he had not the honour to belong to the Orange Society," was enabled to announce that the conclave of grand ma3ters had on Wednesday resolved, irnter alia,e to present a petition to Parliament so worded and so framed that every Protestant who is of age can and will wilingly subscribe to it. From this announcement one might naturally infer that the idea of fulminating an address to the Orangemen had been abandoned by the magnates of the Grand Lodge; and if so, it must be admitted that the more legitimate means of seeking to redress their aleged grievances by an appeal to the Legislature would be a vast improvement upon the original intention. No such notion, however, has entered the Orange mind, inasmuch as the Packet notifies that a " lengthened and important address on mattera of present and pressing interest has been prepared and adopted, and will be given to the public in a few days." Meanwhile all that is permitted to appear as the fruits of three days' labour at the meeting of the Grand Lodge are the following resolutions:- I II That this Grand Lodge feel it to be most bounded upon them (when a greater meeting of the members of the Grand lodge has taken place than at anytime sineothereorganiza. tion of the institution) to record the unabated and deoided attachment of the members of the Grand Lodge to the Orange institution. " They believe that at no former periodaof its history was it so clearly their duty to uphold its principles, to defend its rights, and to employ It for the legitimate, loyal, and benevolent purposes of its orgition. " And they desire to glorify God for many marked tokens of His divine favour in the great inorease of members, in the judgment pronounced upon recent proceedings by a dis. cerning public, and in the evident influence exercised by the institution in every parb of the British empire. "Passed unanimously. " H. A. COLE, M.P., Grand Secretary." TH RaESsURE ON2 THE IRIS1 BANKS. The ordinary commercial letter, dated Belfast, Wednesday evening, and published in the Derry Standard, supplies the annexed information:- " The dispositiona to exaggerate danger, real or imaginary, has been at work, and in our neighbourhood a number of timid people who had deposits in one of the local banks hastened to draw out their money. The folly of this illU judged proceeding has at length been seen, and all is quiet here. NO large amount, however, was called for; the total aid to depositors did not exceed a few thousands. It should a source of satisfaction toeverv Irishman that, amid a]l the disasters and diffiulties of other countries, our banks have maintained the highest character, and that very few failures havetaken place. With two exceptions, the trading world of Belfast has escaped the contagion; and it may further be stated that the business of the town and that of the surrounding country has seldom been so sound or so healthy as during the present year. Trade is dull in most of its branches and smaU transactions rule commerce. At the Corn-exchange few merchants and stiU fewer milers can be found to purchase beyond mere retail quantities of breadstuffs. Wheat sells at 10s. to 11s. for red, and lIs, to l2s for white; Indian corn, 10?. 15s. per ton for prime white. Ead Cobbett lived to see the day when the once-despised product of the westera prairies would sell in this country at ti e price of wheat he would have been exulting over the fc]ei)mont of his early predictions. So fond are the people of tl e north of Ireland of this claws of grain food that at present retail dealers sell three tons of Indian for one of oatmeal. The linea trade has not improved for the past ten days." Later accounts, contained in the Belfast Meicmejy of yesterday, thus refer to the effects of the monetary I ressure in the North:- "As far as Belfast is concerned our merchants and manufacturers appear up to the presentto have been only slightly involved in the effects of the crisis, which is producing such videspread dismay in other localities, Yesterday wes settling-day, and we have full aseurance for the statement that for the past six months there has not beer a '4th' which passed off more satisfactorily. The 'run' on the banks has ceased in Belfast, and confidence appears to have been completely restored, even among the farming classes, who were the principal parties to entertain apprehension. We regret to say, however, that a County Down firm con. mected with our staple tradeis announced to have suspended payment. The liabilities are to the amount of 22,0001., and the assets are said to be likely to turn out amply sufficient, if they could be obtained, for their realization. A smaU house in Belfast is also reported as having succumbed to the pressure, but it is so trifling, only to the amount of 1,3001., that it has received very little attention." THE BROADSTO-NE MURDER. Bernard Gunning, storekeeper at the Midland Great Western Railway, and against whom the most unfounded suspicions were long entertained as being implicated in the hideous tragedy, has had his unmerited sufferings compensated by a donation of 1001. from the company. In addition he has been leased at a nominal rent the hotel at the Athenry station. Gunning, his wife, and their servant, the notorious Catherine Campbell, resided, it will be recollected, in the under portion of the building where the cashier's office is situated, and where poor Mr. Little was murdered on the 13th of November last.

TEE KUeGSwVOOr REFORIATORY SeMooL-The annual meeting of this Institution, which was established about four years ago, and is one of the largest reform,atorv schools in the kingdom, was held at Bristol on Wednesday last. The chair was occupied by Mr. 'W. Miles, M.J., the president; and among other friends of the reformnatory movement present were Dr. Elliott, the Dean of Bristol Miss Mary Carpenter, Mr. B. Baker, and Mr. W. Naisb. The report, read by Mr. Hartaud, the hon. secretary, spoke with satisfaction of the present condition of the school and its progress during the past year. The actual number of inmates on the 30th of September was 51. Of that number 39 were admitted during the preceding 12 months, and a-s 27 had left in that period there was an increase of 12 in the number of boys in the schooL Of the boys who had left the institution S had emigrated, 2 had been pllaced out in England, 6 had returned to their friends, 1 had been discharged as incorrigible, 1 was diseharged on medical grounds, 6 were transferred to other schools, 2 had absconded and had not been recovered, and 1 had died. Of the boys who had emigrated both in the pastaand in previous years the committee had reason to speak rwith great satisfaction, as also of the conduct of those who had been placed out with their approval in this country. Thev could not speak so favourably of those who had returned to their own hiomes. The principal difficulties with wbici the superintendent and teachers have had to contenxd hald arisen, first, from the advanced age which muany of tle boys had attained before joining the school, in many cases iust. short of the limits laid down by the Act of Parlialaent; and, secondly, from the facilities for absconding afforded by the peculisar position of the school, which were far from heing adequately riet by the punishment allowed by the statute-viz., three months' imprisonment, and that not in addition to the assigned period of detention. To meet the first of these evils the committee have come to a resolution not to admit any boy into the school whose age at the time of conviction exceeds 13 years; and, with the view of getting rid of the older boys, they have applied a portion of their funds in promoting their emigration in a considerable number of cases, taking advantage of an excellent opening secured them by Miss Carpeater. The other evlh, ey say, they can only hope to see effoctuially counteracted by the setting apart of establishments as distinctly penal reformatories, to which the refractory inmates of other reformatories might be transferred for the remainder of their orignal period of detention. The number of boys who had absconded fron the school-some of them as often as three or four times-had been 17 during the last year, of whom two had not been recovered, The treasurer's receipts, including a balance in hand on the 1st of October, 156, of 4681. 18s. 5d., had amonnted to 1,5761. 18s. 7d. The sum received from subscriptions and donations was 1771. s.; from the Government 83S;. 5s. ; and from the yarents of boys U1l. 2s. lld. The expenditure was 1,12S1. 15s. 9d., the average number of boys in the school being 47-leaving a balance in hand of 4481. 2s. lOd. Since the making up of the account several subseriptions had been received, and there would likewise have to be added a sum from the Council of Education whica last year was 1931., snd about 1001. as a payment from the Liomersetshire *ps Vstes,
ELECTBIC TELBGRAPHINGA BY STEAM. It migh puzzle the most speculative philosopher or the most ;srofound mechanist to say from which power, steam or electricity, the greatest amount of benefit is likely to result to mankind. Steam has already done wonders, though, in spite of the oft-repeated saying that " It is still in its infancy," there seems reason to believe Ithat already have we nearly approached the wide limits of what can be effected by that power. With electricity, on the contrary, the field that is gradually expanding before the inquiries of men devoted to that branch of science seems almost as boundless and as universal as the electric fluid itself. That electricity has done something of late may be admitted now, even though according to all appearances the result of a few more years of progress on the electric science and the discovery of its applicability to a number of uses now only dimly foreshadowed, will soon make our present attainments appear as nothing. But though the merits of each agency are sought on all sides to be carefully developed, and a:rivafry of progress is perpetualy being instituted, yet the greatest achievement of all, a simple plan to combine both powers, has never been successfuUy attempted until now. With the telegraph electricity has surpassed steam, and there are wise and able men in this metropolis now labouring hard to perfect a grand conoeption, and by the establishment of one strong electro-motive power supersede the use of steam in machinery for evermore. This is a great idea, but perhaps a perfect and harmonious anion between electricity and steam is a greater stlL The first step in that union, which must yield to mankind and civilization the most important and valuable results, has been made by Mr. Boggs, a gentleman whose name has long beld honourable place among our electricians, and who has now divined a plan by which even the electric current may be quickened and ,the speed of the electric telegraph stimulated a thousand-fold. In inven. tions of this kind there is nothing more difficult than to convey to the general reader a clear impression of the value of an improvement to understand every step in the detaU of which requires knowledge more or less intimate of the science of electricity as applied to telegraphic purposes. We shall therefore merely state, in the most general manner, the nature of the plan proposed by Mr. Boggs without at all stopping to inquire into the reason for the effects produced. In order, however, that our readers may appreciate the value and nature of the improvement, it is necessary briefly to state, first, the routine by which telegraphic messages are at present conveyed, and the difficulties which hourly occur: in their transmission. Electric telegraphs of aU kinds are either worked by voltaic or magnetic electricity, the current of which along the wire is altermately transmitted and broken according as the circuit is completed or interrupted by means of a handle, which is worked by a clerk. This alternate transmission and release of the voltaic or magnetic current deflects the needle at the other end of the wire either to the right or left or registers the message by electro-magnetism according to the nature of the instrument employed. As a matter of course, whUe a message is being thus slowly transmitted as it were by hand the whole length of the wire is entirely occupied, while, whatever the emergency, nothing can be done towards forwarding the messages which are to follow until the wire is entirely unoccupied and reported free. Where needle instruments are used messages can be transmitted with compative rapidity; but this advantage is more than counterbalanced by the danger of inaccuracy, and which can only be guarded against by a repetition of aU important messages, Such a repeating process naturally causes a certain loss of time, though even with this drawback it is equal in rapidity to the recording telegraph, but never so certain in its operation. Experience of these matters enables the telegraph companies to ascertain to a single word the number of messages that can be transmtted daily with the wire in full operation; and their charges, therefore, are regulated not according to the cost at which each message can be sent, but according to a scale which not only repays the working expenses of each day, but exch day's interest on the whole amount of capital enabarked in the undertaking. So, then, if any process he discovered by which a message that now occupies an hour in its transmission can be sent in five minutes or less, the sender would gain the difference and only pay for the ocupation of the wire for one-twelfth of the time, and therefore one-twelfth of the amount at present charged. To charge by words is only a more certain method of charging by time, and of course, if any company suddenly found itself in a condition to transact one hundred times the amount of business in the same period and at the same cost that it at present incurs, the gain to the public would be an immediate reduction to nearly one-hundredth of the rate now charged for telegraphic moessages. It Is this great change which Mr. Boggs's invention proposes to effect-to work the electric telegraph by steam, and so get over the great obstacle which no w exists against its more general use-namely, its slowness. It may seem paradoxical to speak of the slowness of the electric telegraph as being the only bar to its more general adoption, but in truth such is the literal fact, for the timie occupied, and therefore expense incurred in using the telegraph wire makes a message rather the resort of commercialor domestic emergency than a thing of daily use, almost rivalling the post as a means of daily communication. The invention, then, which is to supersede these tedious processes and work the telegraph by 8team Instead of by hand Is generally as follows :-A series of gutta percha bands, about six inches wide and a quarter of an inch thick, are coUed on wheels on drums arranged for the purpose. These bands are studded down both sides witb a single row of holes at short intervals apart. When a message Is to be sent the clerks wind off these bands, inserting in the holes small brass pins, which, according to their combinations in twos or threes (with blank holes between), epresent certain words or letters. In this manner the message is, as it were, " set up" in the bands with great rapidity, and if the number of bands employed is sufficiently large-say as numerous as the compositors employed in a large printing-office-messages equal in length to five or six columns of this journal could be set up and readyfor transmission In the course of a single hour. Of course this operation in no respect interferes with the telegraph wire itself, which continues free for use until the bands of messages are actually being despatched. The gutta percha bands when full are removed to the Instrument-roomn, a most simple appliance preventing any derangement or falling out of the pins while being moved about. In the lnstrument-room the bands are connected with ordinary Steam machinery, bv which they are drawn in regular order with the utmost rapidity between the charged poles of an electrical machine In such a manner that, during the moment of eah pin's passing, it forms electrical communication between the inLstrument and the telegraph, and a signal Is transmitted to the other and of the wire, where the spark perforates a paper and records the message. The only limit to the rapidity of the operation is the rate at which the bands can be drawn, since the electrical coatact of each pin, even for the 2O()h part of a second, is more than Baui. cient to transmit a word or signal from London and register it ia America. Of course, as the message is recorded, we will say in America, with the same rapidlty as that in which it is transmitted in London, a number of reading clerks wiU be requisite in order to translate it, by dividing it into smaU portions, with almost as much facilty as it has been sent. The value and Importance of this invention, not only to the public but to telegraph companies themselves, must be evident to the least experienced in such matters; in fact, without it, long submarine lines would be all but impracticable from the slowness of the process, and consequently from the expense attendant upon transmitting the briefest message. It is now tolerably well known that, had the attempt to submerge the Atlantic cable been sucoessful last summer, one submanrine wire would not at the most ha,vo snfliced for the transmission of mnoro than a smaU number of messages per diem each way, and that in fact al that it could have transmitted would not have met one twentieth of the demand from either country. So clearly was this foreseen that even before one cable was laid it was contemplated to eubmerge a second cable, one for messages to England, and the other for messages to A merica. By the new patent for steam telegraphing which we have mentioned, worked with an efficient staff, it would be perfectly easy for one wire to transact all the lusiness between England and America. With proper arrangements an hour would suffice to transmit intelligence equal in number of words to the contents of 12 columns of T Jm 2im es. It is no exaggeration, therefore, to say that the miost important news in each country, with a price-list extensive enough to include every staple of trade, might be exchangedin time for the commeuceinent of busines in the capitals of the Old and New World. Another of the great advantages which the invention possesses is the application of static electricity to telegraphic purposes. To obtain intensity of the electric flduid without qumntity has always been regarded among electricians as the great desideratum for the telegraph. In this both voltaic and magnetic currents are wanting, quantity with them being inseparable from intensity. In long-and, of course, therefore, in submarine-wires quantity in the voltaic current becomes adangerous obstacle, alwayscreating an inducedour. rent in an opposite direction to that in which the message is sent, charging the wire and generally exercising that dreaded retarding influence about the real cause for which so many different opinions exist. To overcome these impediment, many efforts have been made to apply static electricity to tho telegraph, but till now the attempt has always been un- successful. Mr. Boggs produces his power with ordinary plate machines, which are turned of oourse by the same machinery as that whioh winds off his gutta percha message bands. The most simple and ordinary plan provides for the poles of the izaohine being at all times kept equally and properly charged, no mattet at what speed the pin bn4Ya may be pawing between them, and the force of the dischanrg being suilldientto pierce the paper and register the signal a - the end of the wire, no electronmagnetic coil is necessay at; the end of thecircuit. Itisneedlessto pointouttheadvaantages which ths plan posgess on the score of eoonomical produ'. tion of the current, or its greater certainty of pasge aloug a wire when (especially in long submarine cables) it woul]! encounter many slight defects and. attenuations almoAft fatal to the progress of a magnetic or voltaic current. IX these remarks we have merely pointed out the mo3E prominent features of the newr plan, enough to enablet those interested In the subject to recognize the ease and oertainty with which the improvements may be carried ont,j and the vast importance which must result to the oommna nity from their general adoption. In the value of the in.. ventien and the results which it promises it Is second on! j to the great discovery of the electric telegraph itself, whicb( can be fUlly utilized only by this process. The discovers has only been a short time patented, since which Mr. Bogg6t has been employed in perfecting by practice the minor de, talls of his plan. A company is about to be formed to applg and cary out the invention in a more extensive manneg than can be achieved by the efforts of a private individtalj however energetic. There is apparently little doubt, frong the value of the plan and the neity which exists for its adoption, that the company will be as successful as the im* provement it recommends.

STATE OF TRADB. hUNCEHESTER, Nov. t. There is no abatement of the commercial depression, ana we have still to report a flat and exceedingly inactive market. The prices of cotton are gd. to Ad. per lb. below the terms of Monday, and cotton yarns and cloth have given. way fully as much, without inducing a renewal of businc3,. From the highest point yarns are reported in somie quarera to have receded 14d. to 2d. per lb., but any general state. xnent of this kind fails to convey a trne Idea of thepositi,n of the market, because so muce depends upon the position of the seller and the description of paymentoffered. Itis obvious that In such a market irreg l'rtiesprevaU which render nuotations nextto impossible. The news from America by the 7anderbilt, the further advance of disconnts, and advices of failures at.LiverpooL Shefield, and other places have all exercised a most unfavourable influence on the market this morning, and sales are all but suspended. No new failures are mentioned here, and many of the smaller manufacturers and work-ers of old machinery having suceumbed some months ago duxing the rapid rise in the price of the raw material, it is probable that the effects of the crisis will not be so apparentnow. The prostration andruinalready effected among employers are preparing a sad winter for the opern,tive class. Mr. Tryall Hoicroft, silk manufacturer, states that, independently of the distress prevailing at Macclesfield and Middi ton, where many families are literally starving, n. less than 3,750 mill-hands in the silk trade in and aroundt Manchester he.ve been entirely unemployed during the last four to six weeks, while the remainder, upwards of 2, -l)0, have been only working two to four days per week for three or four months past. No means at present e.xist for estimating the distress among opern:ives in the cottoei trade, but it must very far exceed that in the silk trade, and is daily extending by the closing of mills in every direction over this extensive district, and the resort to suorb time, as the only neans apparently left to employers of avoiding loss and ruin.
