The official returns of the Board of 'Trade verify this showing a mean increase of one-fourth, -ir 25 per cent., on the reduced trade of 1855, as well as .-esstoring the equilibrium of the three preceding years.

But if in the metropolis we have imported less than our usual fourth part of the aggregate it should rathirreatesatisfaction than regret; for while our con. -snmBg powver is showrn in the su.bjoined estimate to be figorous and nearly equablo, scarcely affected by the war, or during periods of greateror less supply, wse remain unburdened with heavy stocks of wood, and consequently aueither e:;alted by high nor depressed by low prices.

Yet the fact of the -continued large consumption of wood is before us. If enterprise, if speculation has been inactive, and if in the building and equipment of ships and in military preparations we have not obtained the same equivalent for the works of peace as in 1855, where can we look to a solution of the act but to the indispensable use of wood in every branch -of our domestic economy, in all directions and in every form increasing with our own growth of numbers, wants, and necessities, and requiring yearly renewal to keep pace with -the progressive commerce of the country i" AGRICULTURAL AND LAND INVESTMENT. (From Mr. James Caird.) "Since the confessedly great crop of 1854, which required qittle more than one-half of the average importations to sup3plement it, the breadth of land sown with wheat has in-creased considerably,-in Scotland and Ireland upwards of one-third. If it were safe to adopt the same rule for England, the harvest of 1856 would have almost sufficed without foreign supply for the consumption of the country. But the circumstances of England are so different that we cannot apply this rule,-and, moreover, a considerable proporton of the crop was so much injured by wet weather as to be unsuitable for human food. The potato cron, also which during last year and the preceding one, so largely -contributed to the food of the people, will not this year yield -one-half of the former supply. " In the continued want of offieial statistics of the breadth under crop in England we are thus left to guide ourselves -by the Gazee returns of sales. These seem to show a marked deficiency in the present crop, the deliveries from -the farmers since harvest to the beginning of December in -each of the last three years having been- 18.54. 1855. 1856. 1,446,361 qrs. 1,479,850 qrs. 1,282,968 qrs. 'There is thus a falling off in the present year of nearly oneaeventh, but the deliveries from the farmers have probably been retarded by the fall in price and by the bad condition of the crop. " There is no likelihood, however, of the price of this year's wheat crop going much below its present range. Bet -the extension of railways and the improvement of river and *steam navigation throughout the fertile provinces of Europe and North America must ore long have an effect in equalizing the price of corn. That, however, which promotes the comfort and prosperity of the mass of consumers in this -country will not continue long to be injurious to the English agriculturist, as the people will then have the means of purchasing animal food and dairy produce in greater quantity, and these are the most lucrative products of British agriculture. There are rapid fluctuations in the price of corn, but a steady upward tendency in that of meat. Corn may be brought from every quarter; meat and dairy produce can be supplied in perfection only at home. The .climate of the British Islands is more favourable to their production than that of any other country, and the numoer cf consumers is constantly augmenting. This will enasure stability to the value of land in England. " Irish property is beginning to be more sought after, and the fact may not be generally known that not one-half the property brought under the Encumbered Estates Act -bas jet been disposed of. The comparatively low rate --cf wages in that country, with a lighter taxation of every -md, while all agricultural produce now commands prices nearly equal to those of E;ngland, are circumstances very favourable to profitable farming in Ireland,-and, as rents there have as yet undergone little inerease, there is the more room for making advantageous investments on the present rentaL " Scotch property has recently risen considerably in value, partly owing to the extension of railways and steam navigation, and partly to the great competition for farms among a class of enterprising and properous tenantry. "Attention has recently been directed to the great corn districts in the east of Europe as a profitable investment for .apital. The great drawvback to an Englishman is the feelti ig that his property might not be entirely at his own dis.psal in a despotic country; but the system of land transfer Is very simple. There is this advantage in such investinints-that the price of land is still much the same there as it was in England in the time of William III., while the general introduction of railways and of steam navigation give a purchaser all the advantages of modern ingenuity and markets. Looking to the rapidity with which the wealth of a populous country is developed by the facilities -of radlway communication, and to the adoption of the more liberal commercial principles which are now begun to be acted upon by Austria, I feel much confidence that an investment might now be made in these countries at the present very low prices, which, besides payina a fair interest in the meantime, might, in the course of a very few years, double or treble its value through the mere current -of events, and without any outlay in attempts at altering or in,proving the present iy3tem. ' We have still to lament the great expense and difficulty in this country which the law interposes m the transfer of land. It is to be hoped that a practical subject of such imroitance will not be much longer allowed to escape the attention of the Legislature. But there can be no doubt that the existing difficulties have considerably depreciated ibesvalue of land, and purchasers, therefore, who make their investments before the law is amended will reap all -the advantages which a bad state of the law at present in icths on the owners of-land." LEATHER. (From Messrs. Streatfield, Laurence, and Mortimore.) "We have never had itin our power to record so prosper-us a state of the trade as during the past year. At the early part much doubt prevailed as to future operations, and some tanners, from an apprehension that prices would not be remunerative, ceased working in altogether, and many others diminished their manufacture in consequence of the advanced rates of raw material. Within the last six months, however, it became apparent that the consumption was in excess of the manufacture, and a progressive advance has since occurred in every article, so that prices are now from 20 to 60 per cent. higher than at the commencement of 16r,6, within sufficient supplies to meet the existing de-mand."1 TEA. (From Messrs. W. J. and H. Thompson.) The review of the course of the tea-market during the past year presents the ordinary consequence of an excess of supply over demand-undue depression, followed hyits oppo site feature-great and rapid reaction, so soon as the weighto, -even by anticipation, was removed, * The market opened vith extreme heaviness, the unsettled state of political and monetary affairs aiding to depre'sion; aiid although the importers for some time contiued, by holding firmly, to endeavour to give confidence, it was of no avail; depression prevailed, and with scarcely a variation up to September, prices showed a continuous decline, The sorts most in excess-the Common blackisb-leaf congous-suffered more than any other classes; the decline in these being further forced by the large amonit which arrived out of condition. The letters received early in October, referring to the question of future supply, imparted ,more confidence and led to some im- proveinens; tbis, however, was cbecked by thbe udden in. crease in the value of money; but in the following month speculation again fairly set in-directed at first however, c iefly to the blackish-leaf congou; general revival followed, and the market altogether assumed a healthy tone. Subequently it became bighly excited--general business lasgely increased, speculation being carried on on a most extenaive scale and prices rapidly advancing; when the startling news of the total suspension of trade at Canton, consequent upon our mailitary operations in that quarter <tbe first reports of which received by the bi-monthly mail bad not been duly estimaated), caused a further rise of 1d. per lb., being 3d. yer lb. on common, 4d. to Sd. per lb. on lackisaraf, and &d per lb. on Eaisows, within the three rnonthb,'unt mainly the result of the last few weeks, or in some kinds of even a fow days. - In the late speculative operations the anticipated effect -of the reduction in the duty in April to Ds. 3d. perpound has been an element, as well asthe expected falling off in thesup. plies; and so very large an amount bas now been taken off the market that we must for some time to come look to the action of speculators, rather than to that of the regular importers, as influencing future prices. The stock is now su cient for 15 months deliveries, and may be expected to increase till the new duty comes into operation. At present, however, comparatively very little tea is offering -but as speculation only relieves a market for a time, shouli the concurrent expectations of so many as regards the future short supply not be realized, then, althoagh present circumstances may justify the present currencies, or even a higher range, it would be highly dangerous to act upon them with refereuice to future imports, On the other hand, if oon. fumed, high priceswill continue to rule, However seriously the existing position of affairs at C anton may interfere foratime with merocatile intereets,we t2ust our Goyernmentwill beableto availiteelf of thepreseni opporiunity to place our future relations with China, both commzercial and poltital, on nounder andmore satisfactory basis than heretofore. The imports into the Unitedi Cingdom have been S7,741,0001b. sgainst 83,3M00,Ob. in 1855; the doliveries for home consumption. 63,000,OOOlb. against 63,OD,OOOlb. in 18h55 the deliveries for exportation, 6,241,0001b. against l5,000,(Wlb. in 1855; the btook remaining on the 33st of Otoember, was 88,000,0001b. against 69,500,000ob. in 1855. The imports have exceeded those of ast year by about 4A millions; being 18~ millions beyond our requirements. ihe aggregate delivenes show a fallng off of nearly 9 millions; Dut this is altogether due to te partial cessation of export demand, the hose comsumption being e actl as last year. It is, however, only reasonable to expect that the reduction irn the duty will lead toicesdcnuption, unless, indeed, the benefitbe for aa time lost by any great increase in the bonded price. The stock is excessive and equal to 15 montlsu deliveries at the rate of the present year.
STATE OF TZADE. MANCHESTER, JAN. 9. a' The advance in the price of cotton, and consequently in the price of yarns and cloth, continues to obstruct business considerably, and few sales of any importaxce have been made to-day or during the week. The business in domestics has been confined to small quantities, and operations have been nearly suspended in printing.cloths from the same cause. For 36 and 40 inch shirtings a considerable advance in price is also asked, and these, Eke other goods, are in limited request. In yarns the market continues exceedingly firm. In fact, producers of both yarn and cloth are well engaged and indisposed to take orders under the full prices current.

RGTOF SCOTTrISH PtERSu To Srr IN TEX- HiousE OF COMsIMoNS,-Theastatc of the law on the sight of Scotch Peers to Sit in the House of Commons exhibits all the confusion peculiar to the privileges of the peerage. Viscount Druinlanrig, mnember for Dmufriesshire, has become by the death of his father, the Marquis of Queensberry, a Scotch peer, and conseqoexntly without a seat in the Roume of Lords. Does he in virtuie of his peerage lose his right to sit for a shire or burgh in the House of Commons? It would seem that Lord Drumlanrig has siome intention of retaining his seat, if it be allowable to him to do so by law. Such at least is the question that has been raised, and on -which there sems great scope for fine-spun legal argument. The point was disussed in the Scotch Parliament at the period of the Union, but, as in the case of the lifepernge question of last session, the difficulty was only elvaded, lnlot clearly and definitively solved. The House of Commons, on a certain occasoion, decided that the eldest sons of the peers of Scotland were n3ot capable of sitting for shires and burghs at the time of the Union, and therefore by the treaty of Union remained. inca pable still. The Scotch peers had thus the humiliationL of seing both themselves and their sons excluded from Plarliament except for a brief p.erio by a process of ~election among themselves. This de. cision would seem to have lially settled the question, but the law has in some respects been changed, and exceptions and anomalies have arisen which serve to throw a spLecious air over the claim of one in the position of Lord Drumlanrig, now Marquis of Queensberry, to sit in the House of Commons. The prohibition against the eldest eons of Scotch peers is no lonigerin force, else how did Lord Drum.- lanrig, the eldest son of a Scotch peer, come to represent Dumfriesshire in the House of Commons ? The truth is that the Scotch Reform BMiabolished the disquaalification of the eldest sens of Scotch peers to sit in Parliaament for ishires or burghs, but said nothing of Scotc'h peers them. selves, leaving this a moot point on which mnen of anti. uarian lore and legal talent may still exercise a discursive I Zrincy. The decision of Parliament in the year after the lUnion referred exclusively to the eldest sons of the er of Scotland, so that the(question as rega-rdsperthm selves in thrown bask tG the time of theUio.Gaos Mail.

MAO2EY-MARKETa,ad OITrIYTELLIGENrE. Fr! dAY EIrenWn. The Bank of England notified to-day that they wiU decline making advances on Govermnent securities at a lower rate than 6i per cent. During the recent shutting of the transfer-books their rate for advances of this description was the same as that for discounts-namely, 6 per cent. There is now, however, no reason for affording the accommodation. Very large amounts are in course of repaymoat, and, instead of these being again lent out to enable persons to hold Consols on speculation, they should, in the present state of the discount business, be held available for commercial purioses. In casA of tha generai marxet soon becoming easier a return to the previous rate will, probably, be adopted; but in former times it was not the custom of the Bank, under any circumstances, to make loans on stock; and, although this rule may have been needlessly Btringent, it is unquestionably the duty of the Bank never to relax it except when they can do so without prejudice to the mercantile public. The Euglish funds opened this morning at the closing prices of yesterday, but experienced a decline of a quarter per cent. upon the announcement of the resolution adopted by the Bank. Subsequently the market again manifested a tendency to steadiness. Consols for money were first quoted 94 to i. There wer e afterwards sellers at 93k, and the last price was 93" to 94. For the account on the 5th of February the final quotation was 94i. Money was obtainable in the Stock-Exchange on the terms recently current, and the course of the Bank of England led to no practical inconvenience. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94Â±to i; New Three per Cents., 94~ to i; Exchequer-bonids, 98 to 99; India Bonds, 2~s. discounit to 2s. premium; and Exchequer-bills, is. discount to 4s. premium. The anticipation that there would be no sudden ease in the discount-market at the commenoement of the year is being realized. There was a full general demand for money to-day, and it is understood that even at the Bank of England the applications were rather numercus. Foreign securities were unfa-vourably influenced by sales, and prices generally exhibited heaviness in the later hours of business. Turkish Six per Cents., for money, were negotiated at 95i; and for the accoint at 95i, i, J, i, and i. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions for money were at 1034, and for the account at 103Â± and f. The ordinary operations comprised-Mexican, for account, 21Â±; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 961 and i; Sardinian Five per Cents., for money, 89; for the account, 89 ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., C4 ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, CWI- Z -4r nR In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Hamburg was again rather lower. Paris was a sbade higher. The corn-market this morning was without alteration. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business, and a slight tendency to reaction. I The telegraphic quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening again failed to arrive. The monthly statement of the Bank of France, published to-day, presents no changes of great importance, but its tendency fails to afford any encouragement to the prospect of cheap money. The total of bulion is 7,660,0001., sbowing, although there has still been an artificial purchase of gold, a falling off of 270,0001. This may be accounted for, however, by the payment of the dividends on the shares of the Bank, as well as on the Three per Cent. Rentes and the principal railway stocks. In the face of the reduction of the bullion there is an increase in the circulation of 1,130;0001., consequent upon an expansion of nearly 2,200,0001. in the discounts. The Government balances have diminished 650,0001., and those of private depositors 830,0001. The advances on stocks and railway shares have beenbroughtwithin satisfactorylimits; those on stocks show a diminution of 260,0001., and those on railways 90,0001.; the aggregate amount out upon both these elasses of securities being now only about 2,150,0001. The premiuis for vhe purchase of gold, which in the two preceding months amounted respectively to 25,4001. and 17,3001., have in this instance been 9,2001. From these details it wiiU be seen that the demand for money has been uninterruptedly active, and that no relaxation of the current terms would have been justifiable. Sales have been effected to-day of the bar silver and dollars brought by the last West India steamer. There is no alteration in the price of tho former, which realized 610d., but as the amount of dollars was very limited 6lid. was obtained for them, or id. advance on the quotation for those by the preceding packet. In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been considerable animation, and prices have in several cases experienced an advance. Very extensive supplies of sugar, brought forward on Tuesday, were taken off readily by the trade at a general improvement of Is. to Is. 6d., but an excess at to-day's sales checked the upward tendency, and for some descriptions, particularly.white Benares, a decline of Is. was accepted. Coffee presents a firm appearance, and the business transacted this week has been at fully ls. advance for plantation as well as native Ceylon, the latter sorts realizing 54s. to o4s. (;d. The inquiry for common kinds of rice continues and prices are maintained, but the demand for fine qualities remains inactive. Large sales of spice have taken place during the week, but they have not established any material change from tormer quotations. In saltpetre the operations have been of a most limited character. About 100 tons October shipment changed hands at 39s. per cwt. In the tea-market during the past week business has diminished, partly owing to the small proportion on offer in first hands, and partly to attention being occupied by the China letters. The public sales to-day passed off with spirit; 13,800 packages were offered, about half of which were sold. The following was posted to-day in the StockExchange, announcing another forgery of shares:- "South Australian Copper Mining Company, 11, New Broad-street, Jan. S. "Sir,-I regret to inform you that a forged certificate of ordinary shares in this company was brought to this office to-day for registration. WILL you be good enough to make the fact known to the house, so that dealers may be on their tuard. It is advisable that holders of certificates of shares should take an early opportunity of having them exainined at the office of the company. "I am, &c., "W. L. WEBB, Secretary and Purser. *Mr. Mihill Slaughter, Secretary of the Railways Department, Stock-Exchange." At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day there were some further proceedings in the case of the Royal British Bank. The petition to annul tho adjudication against Mr. Humphrey Brown, M.P., was successÂ£ul, owing to the alleged absence of witnesses. Another petition has also been brought forward to annull the adjudication of bankruptcy against the hank, the points inl relation to which wfill have tobe discussed hereafter. The prospectus has been issued of the British D:eep-Sea Fisheries Company, with a capital of .00,000l. in 101. shares. Operations are to be carried on both upon thL -astern and western coasts. The prospectus has been issued of the California Water Company, with a capital of 310,0001. in 51. sbares. The object is to complete and extend certain works of this nature already commenced at the mines in the county of NevadaS the Californian proprietors agreeing to take payment in shares, not to bear dividend for three years unless in the meantime 20 per cent shall have been declared upon the general capital. At a meeting of the East and West India Dock Company held to-day, Mr. Routh presiding, a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum was declared, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. It vras stated that although, through competition and other adverse circumstances, the earnings exhibit a decrease, the reduction in general expenditure, promoted by the employment of hydraulic machinery and the exercise of strict economy, enables the directors to continue this rate of distribution, and to show a surplus. The cost of repairs consequent upon the accident at the south dock will not exceed 5,0001.,.andto meet the increased demandforwarehouse accommodation a further outlay of about 9,3001. has been incurred. In an3wer to questions it was stated that the Victoria Docks ha-ve attracted business in consequence of the low tariff adopted, and that there has been rivalry in all quarters. With regard to the works undertaken, they have never exceeded the estimates presented by the Court, due supervision llaving been exercdsed.

In respect to goods, the directors have to state that there is a dimunished stock in the warehonses as compared with the Atock at the close of the year 1855, resulting chiefly from the partfcular deficiencies in tonnage just referred to. 'With regard to new works, the directors are now in a sition to apprize the shareholders of the total cost which tas en incurred on this account, and of the provision they have made for its gradual liquidation. "There has been expended on railway sidings and hridges, 8,8401.; junction dock between South Dock and Blsckwall Basin, 82,7971.; hydraulic machinery, 43,9401 ; making altogether 135,1771.

At the half-yearly court of the Commercial Dock Company, held to-day, a dividend vas declared at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free from income tax. The report stated that 939 ships, measuring 318,522 tons, had entered the docks in the year 1856, being au increase, as compared with 1855, of 91 ships and 58,049 tons. At a general meeting of the boot and shoe manufacturers of Northampton, held on Monday, to consider the course to be adopted to meet the extra:ordinary increase in the price of leather, it was nanaimously resolved " that, in consequence of leathertaving advanced from 50 to 100 per cent., it is imperative that a proportionate advance be made upon all goods subject to the variations of the leather-market." The annexed letter states that the stockdealer referred to yesterday as having forged a power of attorney for the sale of 5501. Consols and certificates of 400 Peel River shares was not a memaer of the Stock-Exchange:- " Sir,-The attention of the Committee having been called to a paragraph in The Ti7mes of this day, stating that a member of the Stock-Exchange has forged a power of attorney for the sale of 5501 Consols, and also been guilty of other forgeries, I am directed by the Committee to state that the person alluded to, as having been guilty of forgery, is not nor ever was a member of the Stock-Exchange, neither was he at any time a clerk therein. The Committee will be obliged if you will allow this correction to appear in as conspicuous a place as did the original statement. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "G GEORGE WEBB, SecretarTy.

I TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIR&S. Sir,-In Tour notice, this morning, of the death of Sir Eldmund Filmer there is an error which you will perhaps have the goodness to correct in your next impressirn. It is stated that the late baronet's mother was *the widow of the late Sir William Geary." This is not the case. The mother of Sir Edmund Filmer was the daughter of Dr. George Skene, of Aberdeen, and that lady foried but one mamrae.

The Spanish screw steamer Hamburg, Captain Lagier, also sailed this afternoon with 13 passengers and 650 tons of cargo, for Santander, Corunna, Ciadiz,Mlaga, Alicante, Cart;agena, Valentia, Barcelona, and mar=seile. T'he Europeau and Austalian Royal Mail Company's steamer Columbia, Captain Render, leaves on Monday next with the mails for the Australian colonies. The United States mail steamship Arago, Captain Lines, is to leave Havre on Tuesday next, and Southampton on Wednesday, with the French ana English mails, for New York. The Union Steamship Company's screw steamer Celt, which put back on Monday, was taken into the graving-dock on Thursday and thoroughly examined by Mr. Jobling (Lloyd's surveyor) and Mr. Rubie (engineering surveyor to the Board of Trade). The vessel was found to be perfectly sound in every respect, and she wn leave here again to-morrowr (Saturday) for the Brazils, under the comniandI of Captain Cook. OPPOSITION TO THES INCOME-TAX-In compliance with a requisition to the Mayor sipned by nearly All the leading firms of Bristol, a publi meeting of the inhabitants of that city was held in the Guildhall yesterday, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for a reduction of the property and income tax. Mr. J. Vining, Mayor, presided, and the hall was well filled, Mr. J. G. Shaw (ex-mayor) moved " That, inasmuch as the addition of 9d. in the pound to the property and income tax was made on account of the late war, and was to cease on and after the termination of the strugge, this meeting is of opinion that the tax should be reduced by that amount on and from the 5th of April next, in accordance with the pledge given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer." Mr. Rhavw entered into some statistics in defence of the policy inaugurated by Si r. Peel in 1841, the key to which ie believed to bthadption of thm principle of direct taxation, and said that while there remained one tax which interfered with the consumptive wants of the people, he for one would support the continuation of the property and income tax in its modified form. The resolution was carried, with two dissentients. Mr. H. J. Mills moved the next resolution - "That the present system of levying the tax is manifestly unjust, while the despotic and inquisitorial mode of its asssment is repugnant to the feelings of Englishmen. That the tax has been submitted to from time to time under the impression that it was only imaposed for a temporary purpose, and this meeting is therefore of opinion that the principle of the act introduced by the Right Ho., W. E. Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exche qer, in 1853, providing for the abolition of the tax in 1860, sbwould be faithfully adhered to." The resolution was caried unanimously. Mr. Herapath, mastrate and town-counoiUor, moved the next resolution, an, from his experience as a Commissioner of Income-tax, bore testimony to the oppressive nature of the impost, arguing that it ought to be abolishecd at the earliest possible moment. He concluided by moving, "1That it is desiraIble to alter thepresent mode of collecting the tax, which inflicts much individual hardship and personal annoyance, by transferring the duty to the dRevenue DeDartment." Mr. P. F. Aikin, banker, seconded the proposition, which was carried unanimously. A petition embodying theresolutions was adopted, and the members for the city were requested to support its prayer. Mr. H. G. Langton, M'., stated that, having now ascertained the opinions of his constltuents upon this important subject, he should endeavour to carry out the objects of the meeting to the best of his abWity. Those objetes he understood to be the repeal of the additional 9d. in the pound on the 5th of Apri nlext, and its ultimate total Abolition. Canterbury has not been behindhand in the agitation against this impost. On Saturday a special meeting of the town-council was held, anda resolution passed for the presentation of a petition to Parliament praying for the reduction of the extra 7d. imposed upon the outbreak of the war; but with this the citizens were not content. They thought that the resolution of a public meeting wouild have more effect than one of the towncouncil, and accordingly a meeting was called for Thursday. The Guildhall, where it took place, was crowded by an excited audience. Mr. W. Cooper occupied the chair, but the rnncipal speaker of the evening was Mr. P. Cooper, Q. O. peecheswere made at considerable length, and ultimately the following strong resolution was passed *- "That a Government will Il perfrom ite duty whicb, when the n%tion snnot ecaee in any gretwar. abanU contline %tax to unequal anid unlust, so 1%Inryg aud Inquisitorial , and yet so liable to evasion, so vexateus. gaiting, sod o preesie. and altogether so obnoxious and odiou s0a,hatnow leviuponcootW. The meeting was unanimous in its adoption of this resolution, as also of a second, to the effect that the foregoing be presented to Lord Palmerston.

REPESEBNTATION OF SALFORD.-A requisition is in course of signature to MIr. Alderman Langworthy to offer himself for the representation of Salford, and it is understoodthat he wll accept it if sufficiently numerously signed, of which there is very little doubt. Mr. Lcnegworthy, who is a merchant and manufacturer in Salford has filled the office of mayor, is of liberal politics, and has bien a munificent supporter of the local institutions, having given about 4,0001. to the Peel-park library and museum, and is extremely popular. It is notlikely there will be any Oppoition to hiis election. BBRISTO, SUGAX MANRXYT, Jan. 9.-The offices were reopened on Tuesday last after the Christmas recess.

LONZlDONq SATUBDAY, JAZUABY 10, 1857. The settlement of the questions which have for many months engaged the attention of Europe has been at last accomplished at the recent sitting of the Conferences in Paris. Yet there is little excitement about the matter, and this last act of a great drama is performed without more notice than the busy world bestows on events of very ordinary importance. The truth is, that the solution was known beforehand, and the Conferences sat only to ratify decisions previously taken. The question has been virtually settled for many weeks, and those who looked only for news had for some time forgotten it in favour of more recent events in Switzerland or Spain, in Persi3 or China. Yet the history of this diplomatic contest, in which England has played so prominent a part, is well worthy of remembrance. The result is most satisfactory. Russia yields all that she had claimed, and England obtains all that she had demanded. Russia cedes both Boigrad and Tabak to Mfoldavia and receives in return the town of Eomrat, vwith a territory of 300 square versts. The Isle of Serpent5 gOes with the possession of the mouths of the Danube. The Delta of the Danube forms part of Turkey Proper. Thus all the points which England urged have been fully conceded. Russia claimed the Isle of Serpents that she rmight control the mouths of the Danube, and access to Lake Yalpuck that she might obstruct the navigation. After a long contet, the CzA&, his advisers, and his supporters are entirely defeated, and forced to yield these two important pOSeSsions. We may congratulate ,the country on the courage, iteadfastness, and skill with which this matter has been conducted by the 3ritixh Government. The actual objects gained are of no small moment, but still more unportant are the poiition talken by England and the moral effect of her conduct. Our eountry has gained a great victory, not by artifoo or ingenuity, but by the mere dotermination. to uaphold at al hazards the cause of justice and to enforce the fulfilment of a solemn treaty. By a vigorous wiU and a rightful cause the web of fraud has been xwept away. Yet, the difficulties were not few, and at the beginning might well have caused even a patriotic statesman to pause. It is true that the English people might be fully depended on to support with enthusiasm a Minister who should boldly face such pretensions as those put forth by Russia. Such a speech as that of Lord PALrMEsToN at Manchester will at any time receive the earnest applause of a free people. But at the beginning it might be doubted whether the country would appreciate the danger of the Russian scheme. The Serpents' Island is a rock; Ialae Yalpuck is a shallow lagoon, which no one in these parts is much acquainted with. There was every temptation to let matters take their course. If Lord PAL.xxrsTos. had allowed the Russians to retain these spots it is probable that the fact would have been abnost unnoticed by the public.- Some individual acquainted with the localities might perhaps have exposed the danger in a pamphlet, but few would have read it, and not even faction would have taken up a subject requiring the discussion of tedious and ill-understood details. Furthermore, the war was finished, and a lassitude always succeeds the tension produced by hostilities. The English had concluded the war unwillingly, but when it was over and reduction the order of the day it was doubtful whether even a spirited people would be willing to recommence it. It might be the popular opinion that the opposition to Russia was mere carping unworthy of a great State like ours. Add to this that our chief ally during the war had manifested something like new-born sympathy with our late enemies. The CzAn was dazzling the world with the briliancy of a barbaric pageant, and conciliating France in particular by a profusion of compliments to her E.PRnoit, instituttons, and people. The French Ambassador had been received with marked attention in Russia, and the Russian representative had found the politeness returned by the great of the Parisian world. The E35ERBoR was living in retirement at Biarritz; even foreign policy was directed by his Mlinisters, and these French statesmen had reasons satisfactory to themselves for welcoming a Russian alliance. Sardinia, the neighbour of France and the rival of Austria, naturally followed in the steps of the great Power from which she may hope or fear so much. Austria alone remained, and Austria had been divided from us by many years of mutual illwill, a complete contrariety of institutions, and the stil fresh resentment for the part played by England during the European trials of 1848. It was possible that England might in this matter have no ally but weak and decaying Turkey. Yet the British Minister did not hesitate. Lord LyoNS was ordered to holdthe Black Sea. Austria, vwho knew well the value of the Danube, and was not unacquainted with Russian policy, laid aside all minor jealousies and acted cordially with England. The Courtof Vienna determined to retain its hold on the Principalities. To France the subject was represented with clearness and firmness. The tumult which succeeded is not likely to be soon forgotten. The press and people of Europe took an active part in the acrimonious discussions of October and November. The semi-official press of France seemed to represent the ill temper of men who clearly felt that they were in the wrong, and that the world perceived the fact. England was once again assailed with the bitterness to which we have long become quite callous, but which ceased to flavour the writings of the continental politicians during the short episode of the war. However, this country is not easily driven from its course either by threat or invective. With a good cause, with unimpaired resources, with a people now thoroughly awakened to the importance of the question, with the pledged support of Austria and Turkey, there was no ground for doubting our power to enforce the treaty. When the Emperor of the FnnNcn had the case fully explained, his natural good sense showed him the justice of the English view. But he had already recognized the claims of Russia, and this recognition it was difficult to retract. Hence an arrangement of the matter by which Russia might receive a nominal equivalent was adopted. But the defeat of St. Petersburg is not the less decided. Russia has given up everything, and the disingenuous artifice by which she hoped to gain her ends is fuly exposed, and wiU be had in remembrance for many a year. It is impossible to doubt that this country has in these transactions fully supported its character for energy and determination as well as honest dealing. It has been plainly proved to the world that as we went to war not for mere selfish interests, not for national glory or national advantage, so we are determined not to desist from the struggle until the objects of our sincere and single-minded policy are attained. We have all through had it in view to curb Russian ambition, to protect now and for future times the Ottoman territory, and to preserve the independence of the less powerful States of Europe. With these objects before us we allied ourselves to France, and gave to her a leading place, which the pride of many an humbler nation would have denied. When France wavered and was willing to take the glory of war as a substitute for its substantial Lains. our Governmpnt did nnt: 11-+a+ to join with another Power to enforce the policy from which it had never swerved. The determination of England remains the same, and we may predict that any Power which supports her in maintaining the peace of Europe will find in her a firm and 'vigorous ally, in spite of any differences which may have arisen on other grounds. -We cannot conclude without paying a tribute to the rare courage and skill which the statesman now at the head of the Government of this country has displayed throughout these long negotiations. Amid the vacillation of one Power, the alienation of another, and the iUconcealed hostility of a great part of Europe which called itself neutral, Lord PALMERSTON determined to stand up boldly for the rights which Russia was intent on violating. As is usuaUy the case, courage won the day. Any course less resolute than an armed resistauce would probably have been unavailing. But with an Austrian army and an English fleet watching the contested territory it was felt by all parties that the question was a serious one, and the submission of the Cza has been the result. The PRusrEB should, we think, have the credit which is his due in this memorable affair. The obscure localities which were the subject of dispuite are now endowed with an interest for Englishmen, and in future years people will talk of them as recalling the crowning victory which the most powerful and popular statesman of his time gained over the insidious foe against whom he had struggled with constancy during his long career.
If there is one conclusion more obvious than another in the case of the Chinese rupture, it is that the freedom of intercourse for which we awe now contending is a provision mot only xmost desirable in itself, but one which, if it bad existed at the time, would have prevexted this very embroilment from occurring. There seems to have been no point realy in dispx6e eon which the authorities of the two, mation colad 'have clashed with eacl other if they had, Sait been aYtowed an oppor- tunityof aseertainingeachotherf zinas. TheChinese story, as told by themselves, is as follows :-In the mouth of September last aChinese merchantmna was attacked and plundered by pirates. The master of this vessel, while proceeding up the Canton river in the month next ensuing, recognized on board a certain craft lying at anchor one of the pirates who had robbed him. Of this fact he gave information, and the Chinese authorities consequently boarded the craft in question-which was no other than the Arrow-and took the suspected individual into custody. The Governor of Canton alleges that the Arrow either was not, or was not known to be, a vessel under the British flag; that the British colours were not flying; that he felt himself justified in his proceedings, and so forth. Mlr. Consul PARKES declares, on the contrary, that the Chinese war-boat, after boarding the Arrow, " regardless of the "remonstrances of her master, an Englishman, "seized, bound, and carried off 12 of her Chinese "crew, and hauled dowrn the English colours, "which were then flying." Now, as Mr. PABxzs received this account from the master himself, and as he found the statement verified by other inquiries instituted on the spot on the very morning of the occurrence, we do not think much doubt can be entertained on the point, nor do we see any reason for impeaching the judgment of Sir MrcAzLa Sintioun when, in his correspondence with the Chinese Governor, he represents himself as " perfectly satisfied of the facts." But what we wish to point out is, that under circumstances like these there ought really to have been no room for disagreement or quarrel, if the authorities representing the two nations had put themselves into immediate communuication and opened a free conference upon the particulars of the case. As far as concerns the object of the arrest made on board the Arrow, it is not to be presumed that any British official would have impeded the proceedings of the Chinese, or done otherwise than assist them to the utmost of his power. It is as much our interest as theirs that piracy should be suppressed, and that any crime of this description shoull be brought home to an offender. If LE M rcTAB. was actuaUy a bucanier, or if there was good warrant for presuming that any of the Arrows crew were connected with pirates, the Chinese would have been aided and abetted by our authorities in procuring their capttre and conviction. Our cruisers are constantly engaged in putting down such depredations in the Chinese waters, and it is absurd to suppoee that we, the very business of whose life out there is cammerce, should not be ready and wvillng to curtail the perils to which commerce is thus exposed. As to the nationality of the vessel, that, as well as other incidental questions, could easily have been decided upon the spot, without the smallest prejudice to the case seriously at issue. This case involved simply the bringing to justice of Iu MINrAY and his accomplices, if any there were; and the only point to be settled was, whether the trial should take place in some court within the city of Can on or at the British Consulate before British and Chinese authorities, acting in conjunction according to forms provided. The alleged pirate had been taken, and was actually in safe keeping; if captured on board a Chinese vessel he should be tried in one place, if on board a vessel under the British flag, in another; in either case with a tolerable certainty of getting his deserts. Now where, we ask, in a case like this, which is literally the very case out of which the dispute arose, was there any scope for animosity or violence if the representatives of the two Powers had but conferred together on the matter? We are inclined to suspect that a pretty faithful version of the affair is indicated in the conversation reported between Mr. ConsulPAxxs aud the officers of the war-boat, by whom the original capture of Lx MihGrm and the others was effected. At the very moment of the occurrance, and while the warboat with the prisoners on board was stiU lying cdose to the Arrow, Mr. PABREs repaired in person to the spot for the purpose of getting redress. To his expostulations the officers in question replied " that one of the crew of the lorcha (the Arrow) "was the father of a noted Koolan pirate, and, "being authorized to seize this old man wherever "they found him, and hearing that he was on board "the Arrow, they considered themselves at liberty "to carry him away without any previous refer"ence to him (Mr. PARxES), lest he should lead "to his escape." There is a certain smack of Â¢rientalism in the arrest, not of an actual delinquent, but of his father, as also in the capture of 11 other men at the same moment, not, as Mr. PABuiEs understood, because there was " any " distinct charge" against them, but because they were wanted for the evidence or information they might be able to give; but, notwithstanding this arbitrariness of procedure, it may be very confidently presumed that the British authorities would at once have lent their aid to any bwi4 fide prosecution of a pirate or his accomplices. If the British flag, either through recklessness or precipitation, had been insulted, or Briti3h jurisdiction invaded, the amend could have been proportioned to the offence without difficulty or disturbance; whereas, under the conditions actually exisring, the affair is allowed, throughthe acrimonies of a protracted correspondence, to assume one ugly complexion after another, until at length a matter which, as Sir rcHAEL SuY uioun himself observes to the Chinese High Commissioner, " might in the "first instance have been easily adjusted," becomes identified with the passions of a turbulent populace andthe prejudices of an Oriental nation. We repeat, however, our opinion that the arrogant pretensions of ancient days, always absurd enough in themselves, can no longer find any place in the mouth of the Chinese. There was a certain fitness of deportment in the Great Moguls, when they cast a glance of contempt from their jewelled throne upon a few humble traders from the shores of Europe. There is consistency, if not reason, in the policy of Japan, which excludes all strangers from aU intercourse with the country whatever, and forfeits the advantages of commerce for the satisfaction of exclusiveness. But there is nothing either reasonable or fitting in the claimns of the modern Chinese to a similar position. They carry on with Europe one of the most extensive, steady, and lucrative of trades; in fact, they are draining us of our silver. They flock to our colonies in shoals, and jostle the emigrants from Europe in their rush for ricles. In their own country they are convulsing the land with a vast popular insurrection, directed not only against the dynasty, but, as reports assure us, against even the religion of the empire. Something, we think, we might add about our own power to command, for, though we have hot asserted or ever desired to assert any such ascendancy as circumstances have forced upon us in India, we have shown the present generation of Chinese that the superiority in arms resides entirely with ourselves. But it is not to this power that we wish to appeal. We simply desire such facilities of intercourse us shall remove some of the risks of quarrel, and enable us to pursuo without moItation the avocations of trade. We have no ebject but commerce, and no demaRAds except fei those arrangements which will admit of its toasactions being securely and1 agree~b vnduciW As tho interests of the Chinese movery oao eithesw poinis vre as much concerne ia our own, it is obvio*a to Ire3ume that the. e gR mubad underakwSng would give the best guarAutee for amity sma peace.
A column of figures in malU type is not usually a very alluring spectacle, and yet we published a statement in this form on Tuesday last which contained inteligence as interesting as evenr tho least laborious of readers need desire to find. The facts thus put on record explained the whole commercial dealings of tho United States, an& showed the relations in which the Americans stood to the several trading coumtries of the world as regards that interchange of advantages from which national ties ought necessarily to spring. The account was made up for the fiscal year last past, and its results wil be found strikmg in the extreme. The whole of the domestic exports of the United States-that is to say, the entire amount of the goods actually produced in America and sold to foreign countries-is represented, for the period referred to, by a money value of 310,586,330 dollars. These exports are divided among 36 different States, or, to put the case in more t%iliar language, the trade of the Union is maintained by six-and-thirty customers. Europe, Asia, Africa, and America have aU of them accounts with this great Transatlantic firm, but it is when we come to the comparison of one account with another that the result appears most worthy of note. Of the 3G communities thus dealing with the United States 35 take, in the aggregate, goods to the amount of 114,794,444 dollars; so that there remains an account of 195,791,886 to be kept by one customer only, and that customer is Great Britain. A proportion, in fact, of American produce little less than two-thirds of the whole was exported last year from the States to the various dominions of the British CROWNr; for, if we speak in round numbers and put the entire export trade of the States at something above 300,000,000, our own dealings with them are found to be only a little short of 200,000,000. They might lose all the custom they have got except ours, and still keep together pretty well two-thirds of their business. It matters not to what items we turn, there is till Great Britain at the head of the list. The principal exports of America are cotton, corn, tobacco, and gold. Of gold we took upwards of 33,000,000 dollars; of tobacco, though the disproportion is not quite so wide as in the other cases, we took an amount greater in value than any other State; of cotton we took just about twice as ramch as the rest of the world together. In the articles of grain and flour the distribution is still more striking. Out of 8,000,000 bushels of wheat exported (using round numbers) wetook more than 6,000,000; out of 10,000,000 bushels of Indian corn we took more thau 9,000,000 ; and of 3,500,000 barrels of flour we took more than 2,000,000. The next customer to ourselves is France, in al the items except that of tobacco, where the national predilections of Germany give it a preponderance. In fact, it is noticeable that both G6rmany and Holland surpass even Great Britain in the amount of this produce which they absorb, though they fall dhort of us when it is reduced to money value. Russia does next to nothing, her whole dealings being worth only some 600,000 dollars, of which more than five-sixths are in cotton. The trade of Spain makes a respectable figure, but this is due in great part to Cuba. The reader will inquire, however, whether there is not another side of the account, and whether the United States are not customers of ours ? Undoubtedly they are, and very excellent cIIstomers too. We stand, indeed, at the head of their list in this respect as well as the other. During the fiscal year 1856 the United States imported goods from other countries to the value altogether of 314,639,9422 dollars, and of this amount almost one-half, or upwards of 150,000,000 dollars, they spent with us. After ourselves comes France, as before, while, for the rest, the Americans get their sugar mostly from Cuba, their tea from China, and their coffee from Brazil. But here occutrs another notable feature. It will have been seen that upon the whole the total exports of the States, notwithstanding their magnitude, were somewhat less iMn value than the total imports. To the former, however, which have been limited in our statements to domestic produce solely, must now be added the value of foreign goods re-exported-a sum represented by 16,378,578 dollars-so that on the final settlement there is a balance of more tban 12,000,000 in favour of the exports. But this is due to the goodness of our owvn account. Though we sell so largely to the States, we buy more largely still, and in this respect are far ahead of their other customers. Brazil and Spain (including Cuba) take so little from the productions of the Union that the two together have a trade balance of more than 30,000,000 dollars in their favour. The accounts from France and China are on the same side, and these four, with two South American States, make up altogether a balance against the Union of 50,915,812 dollars. The whole of this, however, is all but liquidated through the accoun' of Great Britain; for, if to our parchases of native American produce are added those of foreign goods made through America, we find ourselves debtors on the general balance to the amount of 50,069,287 dollars. Now, even if we set aside for the moment the ties of consanguinity and common descent, together with the incessant intermixture of personal interests which emigration produces, the merely commercial bonds established between two communities thus situated present an aspect almost marvellous. What increases, too, the wonders of the view is the fact that scarcely any limit can be put to the expansion which this intercourse may yet receive. A glance at the map of the United States will show that scarcely one half of the territories of the Union is as yet brought under cultivation. If the reader should wish to get some tangible idea of the scope thus left available for progress, let him take a district of which a good deal has been lately said and written-that of Kansas. Kansas is only one of the provincea into which the American Union has the privilege of expanding itself westward; indecd, it is not nearly so extensive as the conterminous territory of Nebraska. Yet this Kansas-this debatable strip of land which slaveholders and freesoilers are fighting for-is in itself as large as Great Britain and Ireland put together. What limita can be put to the productiveness of a country like this ? As to corn and breadstuffs, it is said that we are only beginning to discover the capabilities of the North-Westera provinces and even with regard to cotton, am artiecle of a much more exceptional kidn, prc. spects are now held out of an accepti 5e i.- crease in the field of supply. No woncIer, then, that the relations of two such nation;l a& Great Britain and America should find e:res*ion in works forbridgingthomighty ocean.be tween them-works which in themselves parteie. of the character of prodigies. The steamwsof the two countries have broughtNewYorknearaz Lodona than Edinburgh wasbut a few generatims ago, and the project for rendering this commuxrMion abso-. lutelyinstantaneus is now asvuming tXe appearance of reality and success. It is scal)y possible to repres astonjbm eit at the amount of intercourse betw*A thA onountry and the States, even as it actually tands ; wbat proportions it may acquire in a fow short ysrs is a question to baffle aU attmptu at dir;&'4ion. ct o*eture.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE BY IBLCTIC RX D RNATXONA.a TELEGRAP) PERSIA. We have received the foUowing telegraphic de4patch from our Vienna correspondent:- "CONSTANTONOPLE, JAY. 2.

" The Russians have occupied sorne islands in the Balkhan Gulf, on the Turcoman coast of the Caspinn."
SHIP IN DISTRESS. (BY aECTRTc TELEGRAPH.) PORTSMOUTHE, FRIDAY NIGHT. Soon after 7 o'clock this evening minute guns of heavy calibre were distinctly heard ashore at Portsmouth, and after about 10 had been fired Mr. Richards, pilot, proceeded to the dookyard and reported the circumstance, which was the firstintimation of distress conveyed there. The firing continued about half an hoar, and the Acdmiral ordered the Comet and Echo steamtugs and the Sprightly .1team tender to go out and search for the ship in distress. At 9 o'clock Commander Maitland, commanding the *Southsea CoastguaTd station, sent in an official letter to the Port-Admiral reporting the gans, and Etating the flash and sound proceeded apparenLtly from the east end of the Isle of Wight. The vessel in danger is supposed to be either the Pembroke, 60 gun blockship, which got away this afternoon at 2 50 for Leith, or some ship homeward bound from a foreign station. A large number of riggers and labourers have been called into the dockyard to-niight since 9 o'clock to be in readiness to act when the next report is brought in. The night is an awful one, the rain descending heavily, and the wiad being fresh.
SACRED HAMfONIC SOCIETY. The combined attraction of the Requiem sand the LoZtjesainy, in spitti of uIfavourable weather, brought a vast -crowd to Exoter-hall last night. It was a happy idea to present these two masterpieces in conjunction ; and there is reason to believe that the committee of the Sacred Harmonic Society have already found in the union of Mozart and Mendelssohn, a profitable no less than an interesting -andinstructive addition to theirrepertory. Themorefamiliar the Requiem becomes the more keenly are its sublime beauties enjoyed; and it will have been doing a real service to art if, through the medium of these performances, the greatest sacred composition of Mozart eventually attairs the full extent of popularity it merits, and assumes the ,place to which it is justly entitled by the side of Handel's ,most admirable achievements. There can, we think, be very little doubt of the result; and, meanwhile, it is gratifling to observe the increa.ing hold which both the Requiem and its younger companion are obtaining on public etimation. The Lcbyesang, although written half a century later (the Rcquicm was composed in 1791), has, owing to a variety of circumstances, -among the rest the immediate personal influence of its composer, and the fact of its being abstract music, independent of rituals, whether Protestant or Catholic-enjoyed a far better chance of appreciation, and, except to professional musicians and well-informed amateurs, maybe said to have been known in this country manyyears before the Requiem, of which it is now the worthy, and at the concerts of the Sacred Harmonic Society inseparable, associate. The peculiar form of the Lobgesens , and its brevity when comparecd with oratorios to wlhich the subscribers had been accustomed, alone prevented its frequent performance. Its high prttensions as a work, an effort of art, and as n inspiration of genius, were recognized from the fLrst, when it was mtroduced, together with a new setting of the 114th Psalm, under Mendelssohn's own -direction, at the Birmingham Festival of 1840-six years before the production of blijah, which shed a lasting renown on the greatest of our provincial music meetings. The bold and wise policy which induced the co.n3nittee of the Sacred Harmonic Society to lay aside an unmeaning prejudice, and present the Requiem at their concerts, among other advantages attending it, provided a fitting and permanent place for the Lobgesany and an entertainment for the music-loving public of varied and unsurpassable attraction. In pursuance of a plan recently adopted, historical and critical analyses of both works (from the able pen of Mr. Macfarren) are now published with the programnmes, and a careful perusalof these cannotfailtoenhauce the enjoyment derived from their performance. The execution last night. was one of the most generaly satisfactory as to details and one of the finest in prominent nassages that we remember since the engagement of Mr. {iosta, as conductor, gave new life and vigour to the Sacred Harmonic Society, and helped to establish on a firmer and snore enduring basis Its position as the foremost institution of its character In Europe. In one or two of the choruses of the Lo?gesang (which, as in the case of St. Paul, are less flattering to tho voices than those of ElijQA and sonie later compositions by Mendelssohn) there was still something to wish. In theufugal part of the first chorus -commencing from the words, " Praise the Lord with lute and barp"-both pointed accent and general clearness were occasionally wanting ; whlle in " All ve that cried unto the Tord," which flows so beeantifully out of the plaintive tenor s10o, the last quality, added to that of just intonation, was more than once missing. The rest wss almost irreproachable; and seldom, indeed, have the members of the Sacred iarmonic Society more honourably distinguished themselves than in that glorious burst of exultation, "The night is departing, the day is approaching," which they declaimed and sang with an enthusiasm that carried the audience along with them from beginningto end. Thethreegreatinstrumental iovemerts that usher in and prepare the mind of the hearer for the vocal portion of the " sinfonia-rcaata" (as the composer has 3ptly designated his work) were splendidly given by the orchestra, and, long as they are, were listened to throughout with undisturbed attention and delight. The principal singers were Madame Novello, 1&. Lockey, and Air. Sims Reeves. If ever the effect of a high and resonant sop-ano was well calculated, it is in the shortsolo, "Thenightisdeparting," &-c., which announces the magnificent chorus upon the same words already mentioned. Itwouldbeimpossibletogo beyond Madame Novello in the delivery of this solo, where the purit of her intonation and the quality of her tone are equally remarkable. Only such a voice as hers, indeed, can possibly render it justice. The melodious duet (with chores), "I waited for the Lord," was perfectly sung by the twoladies; and here the applause of the audience act restrictions at defiance. The most admirable vocal display, nevertheless, was that of Mr. Sims Reeves in the recitative, ";We called through the darkness, ' Watchman, wil the night soon pass,'" which describes the eagerness of repentant sinners for the promised salvation with an eloquence and intensity that have never been exdelled. Mr. Reeves thoroughly understands the signification of this highly impressive passage, and gives equal effect to words and music. Well as he always sings it, however, he perhaps never before last night gave such fervid -and complete expression to the whole. Last year, if we remember correetly, we had to complain in a great many respects of the performanee of the Reo uieiu; but on the present occasion there was scarcely a -ut tofid The solo singers-Madane Noveloo, Mr Lockey, Mr. Sims Reeves, and Mr. Thomas-vied with each other in zeal, and sang the three quartets to perfection. Two of these-the " Recordare" and " Benedictus"-Mozert himself has nowhere exceUed; while the other-" Tuba mirum"-though more od captandum in style, scarcely reaches the height beneath which no other piece in the Requiem once descends. Nevertheless, all three are as essentially " Mo7art" as anything that ever fel from his pen; and happily the exclusive right of the great lasician to the whole of his immortal masterpiece is now established beyond controversy. The choruses were capitally executed, with hardly an instance to the cor.- trary. Many passages were really surprising for accuracy and precision; and among them somle of the maost difficult -as, for example, "Ne absorbeat eas Tartarus" (in the Donmine Jesu Christe" of the Offertory), where the fugued subject given to the vocal parts is accompanied by an elaborately developed counterpoint for the stringed instruments'l the wonderful setting of the words- 'Ittu resurRet ex faviUa " udicandus o reuam- (in the "L Iacrymosa"), where Mlozart-if we may draw conolusions from the manner in which the melody graduaUy ascends, step by step, for an octave and a half-successfully emulates his gifted predecessor, Handel, in an attempt at what musicians term " word-painting ;" the " Rex tresnendai" and " Confutatis maledictis,' two of the most difficult, no less than two of the finest pieces in the " Dies irza ;" and, lut and best of all, the " Agnus Dei," where, besides the forcible expression given to the whole movesment (the most profouand and masterly in the Requiem), the pathetic phrase on the words " Dona nobis requiem" was asng at each period ot its recurrence with a softness and yet a fulness of tone that preserved all the rich effect of the harmony in the midst of the most delicately graduated piano. In short, last niAt's perfomance may be recorded with just pride by the members and patrons of the Sacred Harmonic Society as one of the most unexceptionable in the history of its career. On Friday, the 23d inst.,-after Mendelseohn's mnusic to Alhz7ie (the English version of the text to be recited by 31r. Phelps, the well.known comedisn)-another " innova-tion" is to be mnade. Rossini's Stelxiat Mfaer will be attempted-for the first time at these concerts-with Mladame 2Toveilo, Miss Dol'y, Miss Sherrington, Mr. Sims Reeves, a j Signor Belletti, as the principal singers.
We have received many letters containing checks and sums of money contributed by charitable per. sons for the Broadstairs boatmen who saved the crew of the Northern Belle from a watery grave. We have transmitted these donations to Mr. John lang, of Broadatairs, Kent, who first drew our -attention to the conduct of these brave men, and -who, we have no doubt, will duly acknowledge these charitable gifts, and undertake the duty of <distributing them, together with any more which -may be sent to him for a similar purpose.

MILITARY AND NA VAL INTELLIGENCE. T1e following circular has been issued, dated Horse Guards, Jan. 3:- "The General Commanding-in-Chief, with the concarrence of the Secretary of State for War, directs it to be notihied that the circular memorandurn from this department dated the 15th of February, 1855, allowing soldiers who re-enlist within two years after their discharge to reckon their former service, is hereby cancelled ; and that the rule as laid down in article 27, page 232, of the Waroffice Regulations of 1848, whereby soldiers are required to re-enlist within six months of their discharge to entitle theim to reckon their previous service, is to be considered as,agin in force. "By command of the General Commanding-in-Chief "G. A. WETHERALL. AdintanLr-4,, 'lhe board of commissioners from Chelsea Hospital, consisting of Dr. D. Maclachlan, Deputy-Inspector-General of Hospitals, and Mr. A. Moorhead, assisted by Drs. J. R. Taylor and J. C. G. Tice, who have been engaged for two days at Chatham in inspecting sick and wounded troops who were unfit for further service, concluded their labours yesterday. The number of troops of all 'ranks ordered to be discharged was 130 on Wednesday and 70 yesterday. The steam troopship Vulcan, Commander Furneaux, we learn by a private letter, made a splendid passage to Sierra Leone of only 16 days from Spithead, and expected to be at the Cape of Good Hope by Christmas-day. Baron von Stutterheim and the officers of the British German Legion on passage to the Cape were all well. Her Majesty's steam blockehip Pembroke, 60, Captain Fraser, left Spithead yesterday for Leith Roads. These ships have only a complement at present of 230, but it is supposed to be a part of the intended system to fill up to 500 from the raw material of the comat, and work it into the perfect seaman. The vwhole of this Coastguard squadron will be under the command of Captain Charles' Eden, C.B., who will hoist a pendant as commodore of the first class, which gives him the pay, table money, and powers of a rear-admiral. The steam troopship Urgent, Commander Phillipe, went into Portsmouth harbour yesterday afternoon to refit. Her Majesty's steam blockship Hastings, 60, will1 be removed from the ordinary in Portsmouth hahbour on Monday and taken into the steam basin for repairs and to be brought orward for re-commission. The Arctic ship Resolute remains moored off Chatham dockyard in nearly the same state as when handed over by the American Government, the only persons allowed to go on board being those connected with the dockyard. Yesterday preparations were commenced for removing her stores into Chatham dockyard.
THB INNOCENT CONVICTED. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent, the Rev. John Davis, the Ordinary of Newgate, has called public attention, in your impression of the 8th inst., to the case of John Markham, who, being innocent, was yet convicted, and sentenced to four years' penal servitude, for aiding in uttering a forged cheek; and you have in your leader of this day commented on the necessity of redress to him for the grievous wrongs he has sustained. As I am well acquainted with the facts of this man's case, perhaps you would afford me a small space to narrate them, although no language, nor the most vivid imagination, can picture the extent, the depth, the horrors of this man's sufferings, as he described them to me after his release. Hle was walking in Oxford-street on a Saturday in April last, when a policeman touched him on the shoulder, and finally took him to the station-house. Being Saturday, he was detained in a cell there till Monday, and I was then taken before a magistrate. Before be was finally committed for trial he was remanded from time to time for six weeks; one month of the time of these remands he was detained in the House of Correction and the remainder in Newgate. On his trial he was most ably defended by Mr. Serieant Ballantine,who, interested in the case and satisfied of his client's innocence, exerted himself to the utmost to procure his acquittal by a most eloquent speech; nevertheless he was convicted: a witness, certainly a most re spectable and honest witness, had positively sworn to his identity. The jury relied on this testimony; the witness was mistaken; the man was sentenced to four yearse penal servitude. I heard his trial; I was satisfied he had been unjustly convicted. The execution of his sentence began; he was two months In INewgate picking oakum with the convicts there, who in this prison are all in one room together-three marderers at one time, pirates who had deliberately planned wholesale massacres, to be accompanied by indescribable atrocities; burglars, garotters, thieves from their birth, receivers, and putters-up of robberies, and the perpetrators of unmentionable crimes. The amusement of tkis den of devilry isto narrate their crimes, and to plan fresh ones. Now, John Markham was innocent, and he constantly asserted his innocence; in consequence he was persecuted and tormented by his associates here with the most virulent and relentless malignity. It is impossible to narrate the constant outrages perpetrated on "1 the countryman," as he was called by these felons. To the regular criminal imprisonment in Newgate has little terror; he rather likes the opportunity of telling boasting stories of crime to such an audience, and at this amusement the most criminal shines the most, and is thought the highest oS In the course of time Markham was removed to Millbank, where there is a separate confinement-a dreadful system; locked up in a gloomy, solitary cell at half-past 5 in the evening, to bed at 8, rise at 6 in the morning. Can any one conceive the horror of this man's thoughts? He had parted with all his ready money and many of his things for his defence;bhe had a wife and child; they were utterly destitute; she parted with every stick of furniture and every rag of clothing during his imprisonment, and many a day was without a meal of victuals, and now in agony unutterable he often thought of her and of how she was existing. From MiMbank Markham was moved to Pentonvile, where he was three months in solitary confinement-solitary and separate even in chapel, where each prisoner is enclosed in a wooden box, so that he can see no one hut the clergyman; here in the chapel, at the soumd of a human voice, the convi ets are often affected, faint away, or shriek out. " Why?' I asked Markham. "Oh, they think of home or something of that," he replied. At this prison the prisoners wear a mask made of cloth, very hot and very unpleasant. At length the really guilty man Vw8 taken, and admitted that Markham was totaily innocent. The touch of nature which makes al mankind kin is not wanting even in crime; this man sent Markham's wife 51. by a mode most elaborately circuitous, to avoid being traced. The Governor of the Pentonviile Prison finally broke it to Markham (in so thoughtful and considerate a manner that it seems to have made the deepest impression upon theunhappy man) that he was no longer a prisoner;. that it was proved he was innocent; that he was now a free man, and might go as soon as he liked. The governor then sent a policeman in plain clothes to inform Markham's wife of his liberation, and gave him a sovereign. Well, he is free. The delirious joy of unexpected liberty passes away, an d now he has no worlk, no means of getting a living-character gone. Was he not tried, convicted, and sentenced ? People won't believe he was discharged from prison becausebhe was innocent I I was much struckwith the justice of the following remark from your leading xrticlo, and the necessity of your recommendation being adopted, " He should be invited to attend at the court where he had received his sentence, andhis innocence sould be as emphaticaly proclaimed by the presiding judge as his supposed guilt had been on a former occasion." By the exertions of the Ordinary of Newgate another man, Martin by name, who had been convicted and sentenced to four years' penal servitude for highway robbery, with violence, at Bethnal-green, was proved to be innocent. I beard this man tried and doubted his guilt. When undergoing his sentence he came under the care of the Ordinary of Newgate; he believed him to be innocent. We ransacked Bethnal-green for three days, and got undoubted evidence that he was not guilty, and, moreover, discovered who was the guilty man. Martin also was pardoned, and not long since be stood in my office an emaciated wreck of his former self. Before he went to Millbank he said he didn't know his own strength, and could work without fatigue the longest day. I am, Sir, your most faithful servant. J.

During the extfiveyeara, imports, 20,456,3001.; exports, 17,858,4001. The imports of the last five years show an invcrease on the pevions IvO to the extent of 13,767,0001., or fully 200 per gent.; the exports exhibit an increase of 11,951,9001., or abori, the same ratio of increase as the imports.

Setting aside the gold, the value of our exports of colonial produce have steadily increased, both positively and relatively, until last year. ARTICLES OF ImPORT Am ExPOT. In 1854 we exported more breadstuffs than we imported; last year the case was the reverse, our imports exceeding the exports by nmore than half a million sterling-626,000lbeing in the ratio of nearly eight to one.

Our exports, on the other hand, had zather declined, the amount in 1854 being 370,6001., and in 1855, 292,5001. From New Zealand, in return for every 1,0001. of our exports, we received in imports during the first five years about 1681.; during the last five about 3601. From Tasmania, South Australia, and Victoria our imports in 1854 amounted to 484,8001., in 1855 to 301,4001., being a decrease of 183,4001. Our exports to them in 1854 were 1,254,1001.; in 1855, 997,5001.; a decrease of 256,6001. In the first five and last five of the 10 years the amounts were as under:- Imports from.

In proportion to every 1,0001. we imported from themn we exported to them in the first period only 6761., the balance of trade being much against us; in the last five, 2,7831., the balance having turned very largely in our favour. For every 10,0001. of our imports from these colonies w exported to them, fromlS46to l850, 11,9001., duringl8.;1 to 1855, 27,7001. Our imports from the South Sea Islands in 1854 were 47,1001.; in 1855, 59,3001.; an increase of 12,2001., or 26 per cent. In 1854 we exported to them 61,0001., and in 1855, 26,4001.; a decrease of 84,6001., or 57 per cent. Our imports from the Islands have increased 122 per cent.; our exports to them 92 per cent. The' aggregate imports for 1846 to 1850, from the United States, were 20,2001.; during 1851 to 1855, 698,9001., an increase of 678,7001. The aggregate exports of the laus five years were less than those of the two years 1849 and 1850. We ara thus better customers to the Americans than they are to us. Our imports from other foreign States in 1854 amounted to 873,3001. ; in 1855, to 1,098,5001.; an increase of 225,0001. or 26 per cent.

IACOMXE-.TAX ROBBBEBY. TO THEI EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The above may appear a somewhat strong heading, but a perusal of the folloising statement will prove that it is not too much so - A day or two ago I Visited one of the towns in the Birmingham district for the purpose of ascertaining the feel. ing of the inhabitants resoecting the income-tax In a conversation which I had wfth one of the leading residents he told me that he had been an asesesor, that when the returns for the town and district were sent in a secret commissioner "from Wales," who was so much a stranger to the place that he had to ask its name, and " what kind of a place it was," and who, therefore, could know absolutely nothing of the residents, sat down, and coolly added so much per cent. to the various returns. This secret commissioner thus ractically said,-" All the magistrates, all theclergymen, al the merchants, manufacturers, traders, &c., of this district are unworthy of belief, and with a stroke of my pen I adjudge them as liars." Sach cases, I was informed, are numerous. *Sir I, for one, cannot discern a shade of differnce in pncinple between the doings of secret commissioners and thoee of the footpad, or burglar. I hold the law which sanctions such robbery-for robbery it is-is as detestable as would be an enactment which legalized theft. Whereever I go in this populous and influential district I hear the same tale of * surcharges," browbeatings, hopeless appeals, and unjust taxation. I warn the Government that a spirit is abroad ariong the people on this sabject which will not be laid by a few fine ofiicial flourishes, and I am confident thAt members of Parliament who oppose the voice of their constituents on the matter of income-tax reduction or abolition will have an unpleasant ordeal to encounter at their next appearance on the E hustinm Tf - Rir X- VERAX. i Birmingham, Jan. 8.
SINGULTw CA.-On Wednesday an inquest =L held at the Calcutta Inn, Celtenham, before AIr. J. Lovegrove, respecting the death of a young woman named. Mary Ann Gilkes and of a male child of which shn,had been delivered a short time before her death. The:pecnhiaity of tJe case is that the birth of the child v.a not discoveredvntil aftertheburialof themother. Anedical gentlemaxn who attended the young woman gave w.CertiMcate that she died from epilepsy produced by en,sAuxtiouo and the eoroner, inthe exercise of his discretion, ixdirefused to hold an inquest unti after the discovery of the body of thechild. That circumstance, however, ledto theexihurnation of the body of tbe mother, and,aftera long inoIey, tb jury returxed a verdict that Mary Ann Brunmey 'Gikeah3d died frors epilepsy, arising from exhaustior. thro oai loss eE blood and negleot in her confinement, ancl that 'GU child lad& died though the 'wilful design or negleot of the mother, who was therefore guilty of "WilfuJ murdaw."

THE CLBBRGy AND EDUCATIOZ. TO THE EDITrOR OF THE TIM. Sir,-I thank you for the inserion of my letter on the "Idleness of the Clergye a few days ago. The additional evidence which it contains *il, I trust, serve the object which we both have in view-viz., giving the public a closer approximation to the truth. But meant to say Ahat there ard many of my cleried brethren, quite as oonscientious ana perhaps more devoted than I am, wiho would have less to show for their yer's work. They engage in fewer undez: takings, and the uniformity makes the whole appear abonu the half of what it really is; or they have to contend against some hostility, open or avowed, and must be content to sustain when they would extend and enlarge. They are embarrassed by allowable ties of a domestic nature, or they are unable to take the ume degree of liberty with their health and oomfort. With such men, however excellent and honourable in all the duties of life, a diary would show less than in my own case, even if kept with the same regu larity. In my relactance to trespass upon your space I omitted information which was necessry to the defence of my own position. It is quite an error to suppose that any man in my, position interferes to a needless extent with education. Knowing that most of the adults of 40 years old ate prac. ticallybeyondihope of change, the clergyman naturally turns his attention to the young, whom he may influence directly, and through them the parents indirectly. But, as a national school cannot be made self-supporting, except in a mixed population, so there are special situations where pecuniary resources are forthcoming, but adminlstrative aid is wholly out of the question. In my own case, for ex. ample, there is not an inhabitant of my parish subscribes a single shilling; and I eould easily mark out an area on the map, representing 50,000 souls, of whom not 20 give any subscriptions for schools, except in church collections, I have tried the experiment of a committee, but of 11 selected gentlemen, nearly all of whom are connected with the, neighbourhood in business hours, only one attended our meetings. The truth is that in all our great towns population has a tendency to classify itself, and a handred polnts aL over the country has each a St. Giles's and St. James's of its own. What aid can a clergyman hope to receiTe in a " block" of streets whose aristocracy are publicans and pawnbrokersthe classes which live, one by the misSortunes of the poor, and the other by pandering to their vices. In one street of my own parish, eontaining 374 families, I have never bean able to get more than 29 on my list of "visitable and hopeful." A man was murdered in it about a year ago for the value of his clothes and a few shillings in silver; and I remember calculating at the time that the accomplices had received about 3s. each as the wages of their horrible crime. I have been told by a publican th4t if I succeed in civilizing this street he may close his house. There are five ecclesiastical districts surrounding my parish. In two of them, one better and the other worse thali my own, schools are supported by a socie' y in the town, without any efrort on the part of the incumbents. In two others, from the p~euliar character of the congregations, the schools are virtually sapported by the town; and in the fifth schools have been abandoned for years, the clergyman having found them to be an intolerable millstone about his neck. This last approaches to within a few feet of our civic Exchange; but our merchants and mnanufac turers subscribe for the support of education near their suburban residences, where aid is scarcely at all required, and withhold the intellectual. bread from the lips of the poor man's children who surround the doors of their offices. X have protested against the system pablicly and privately tor years; and I hope that in endeavouring to diminish this and similar evils, which unfortanately are not confined to this town, I may teckon upon yonr able advocacy. V Ar]n, A LA?CsASEtRE INGUM2BENT. Jan. 8. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-" The Lancashire Incumbent" eeems to be a hardworking man, just the person to have 8,500 souls committed to his charge. I am a country rector, with only 460 souls in my cure, and therefore I presume you wil class me with the "slow-bellies." My living is worth about 4001. a-year, and, perhaps your readers may like to know what it is that I do for the money. I will make a clean breast of it; only, in justice both to the church which youL so vehemently upbraid, and to myself, who am more than 60 years old, I must refer to the past as well as to the present time. I served 24 years in the church before obtaining a living. My first curacy was a sole charge in a populous town. I exercised my ministry continuously during 17 years in Asia and Africa; five times I have been round the Cape of Good Hope, always on such occasions preaching to, and holding prayer meetings with) the sailors; I have had spiritual charge of large military hospitals; and I still correspond with soldiers to whom I have ministered. Now I preach twice every Sunday; I meet my people ono evening in each week for prayer and in exposition of Scripture; I have a Sunday-school, a day-school for boys and girls, an evening-school during the winter months for adults and boys at work; the schools are maintained entirely by voluntary subscription, without endowment or Government aid; I isit the sick, reading the Scriptures, making suitable reflections, and praying with them; allmypeople expect metovisitthem at their houses, whether sick or whole, rich or poor; I have to attend daily at my own house to the wants of the poor, who have freo access to the rectory for medicine, food, and advice. I bury the dead, and marry, and bapti7e; I keep and transcribe the public registers and school accounts, attend vestriea and local meetings, correspond with authorities and societies, represent the parish, and am at every person's service at all times, for all things. I submit that a person so employed is neither idle nor useless; that he is neither under-worked nor over-paid; and that his services to society may be advantageously eompared with there of a snb-editor, an ordinary lawyer, an ordiary doctor, an ordinary Government clerk, or a line officer In the army. Obeerve, I claim to be compa7ed with ordinary people, because I am but an ordinary clergyman, in nothing superior to the grepa mass of my brethren, nor differing from them, except in the lightness of may daily work. I need scarcely add that there are many censpicuous men it the rninistry of our communion whao have still higher claims than I and sacb as I am can prefer to the respect and sympathy of the public. My object, however, is nob to extol the great aud shining lights ca our church, but toshow that bsc-ministeys in general are-:ot the lazy, useless, being which, ow-ing to imperfect irn5rmation and pattial viekW they are too often representedl to be. Ih yourpower jounsal you have severcl animadverSod on the clergy as a class; I trust, therefore, to your sensa of thstice to insert; this vindication of tha' portion of hIemIwhc,* kisnovm as the eountry or rural elagy.

 FORJYST. TO THE EDITOE- OF THE TITSM1. Sir,-Were Parliament sitting I should not sek of you the favour of publishing the enclosed correspondenee with the Nevr Forest Commissioners, s my Atatement wrould be publicly made, and probably appear with the usual cstsracy of your reports. There has been for somne time a commission appointed *0 adjudicate on t)e coromoaeza' rights in this ancient forest. The deer have laen destroyed by ac of Parliament, and I eonclude that tht object of the present investigation is, that if ever the fhst asould bewholly or partly enclosed thenation should py the "alle2t posible compensation to the commoners. Th5I- class ia composei not only of lancL owners, whose farms enjoy forest rights worth 6 or 7 per cent, on their value, b'its of a srge nonuber of very poor persons, whose existenow may be- said to depend upon the right of turning out catt3e and cutting turf for foel in a country vrbere coal is often at 3Ds% per ton. Granted th,t many of these are squattrs, and have no original right yet the gReat lapse of time sin,e the laot court was held, the idea that centuies baws- coresorated both fair and foel, and the inportance of the privilege itself, render the challengo now gien. by the Crowu inevitebly a hateful proceu Thc amss masndx is put upon thc sommoners, and they are bound to prove to the commissioners that they haverexercisek their righta ever since lSOO. It is therefore neoesmry to obain witnessef of at least 70 years old, and you may inagine that-the e,spense of sending these arid the bill of thcattorneyare formidabl obstacles to a defeadant whose property is reckoned in shiUings. Most of these men believo'it.to-be a prosecution of the Sovereign h6rsalf against thom, for they are utterly unable to understand the compronmiss with. rsard toi "town Lanus mawe between the Queen and, Pirliament on her accession, and in their eyes the abuaglo bears all the odium of a contest between a monarch and a pauper for a personal object of gain. I do not, of course, object to the in7estigetlen itelf, which ought to have taLker place every 20 years, but I am showing how invidious the taskmiat now be, andhow productive.of hard cases and bad blood in a poprltlon scattered over 80,000 acres. Assumiag this as a fact, itwouldappear evident that the greatest tact should be shown by the commissioners, and the most indulgent spirit evinced by them, to reduce as much as possiblethe expense and delay to which' they subject the commoners in this triaL This) im. my opinion, has not been done; and, desirous of obtaining a remedy, I addressed to the scmmissioners the letter of Decemberl7 which I enclose, and which states my objections. I am myself a party largely concerned in forest rightsi and therefore considered that I was jrstified inprotestingagainst the course pursued by the Court. It appears that I was mistaken, for you will see that Willam. Rufuse the Norman, could not have risen more proudly in his stirrups than did William Stead, clerk to the commissioners, at my presumption. Judging from his. reply, those gentlemen "do not recognie in any man the right> to suggest that ninecessary delay and expensive proooedings, which deciaate our aged wlitnesses and scare us fron. defending our claims, are umfair weapons to use against us. Yet such are employed, and it is a fact that the Court wich opened at Christchurch on the 30th ult. has sat only four hours per diem on an average during last week, although the commissioners have postponed sinc die a list of local cases all of which might be settled in a fortnight by a moderate amount of diligence. The cost to the public of this oommission, so conducted, I shall obserre upon hereafter. remain Sir. vour obedient -4n lhe Uekrk to the Commissioners for theo Near Forest Claims. MALMESbURY. Longleat, Jan. 8. (No. L) "lHeron-court, Dec. 17, 16 Gentlemen,-Having lately returned from broad, I have only just learnt from Mr. Druitt, At Christchurch, that you are about to hold a Court upon Forest Claims at that place; but that mine, although my property is actually adjoining, are not to be investigated, but are deferred to a more distant period and locality. I therefore beg leave to ask you upon what grounds my interests are treated dif. ferently from the majority of cases belonging to this parish ? If it be so, I am exposed to a 8reat increase of expense in sending my witnesses (necesm.a, extremql aged persons) a long day's journey, instead of a short v/lIc, to the court, while the poorer claimants, whose witnesses would be nearly the same as mine and those of the large proprietors, are de prived of the advantago of saving ther expense altogether Dycing them simunltaneously with ours. As I consider it a case of great and apparently lseless injustice and inconvenience to myself and others, I havs taken the liberty to press upon you my viewr of it, in the hope that you may thinlk fit to take the vvhole of this parish at the same time and place. " I remamn, Gentlemen, your obedient servant. " ALMALBURY. I -ane n-on. ;ne uommmssoners lor .orest Claims," " Chrlstchurch, Jan, 1. Iy4 LYord,-I hxve laid your Lordship's letter before the New Forest Commissioners on the first occasion of their meeting since the receipt of it. I am directed by the commnisioners to acknowledge it, and to inform your Lordship that they cannot take any notice of the questions and argu. menits therein contained, as they do not recognize in any man the right to address thcm in the manner your Lordship has thought fit to aqssme. Tho usual public notice will be .given of the time and place at which the commissioners will hear and determine on your claim. "lIam your Lordlshio's rerv nh~aelo ,.n, " W.

"Having been in the habit of corresponding officiaIl with every class of public servants, both abroad and at home, and having myself had the honour to hold a high responsible appointment under the Crown, it would be traly unpardonable were I to deserve the charge of showin a want of courtesy and respect to persons delegated by ler Majesty for any particular service. 'With this feeling in my mind I have carefally read the copy of my letter of the 17th of December to the New Fotest Commissioners, without being able to discover the unintentional offence which, as you stat3, ' the manner I have thought fit to assume' has caused. I conld have- had no motive in offering such to the public position of these gentlemen, and still less to them personally, becanus. b am at this moment unacquainted even with their names. lHad I foand in my letter any expression which could be construed into a solecism in private or official corespondence I would gladly offer them an apology. As-it s, I cannot do so; but, on the contrary, must affirm that, in ap. plying for an explanation of certain orders which appeared to subject myself and my poorer neighbours to unnecessary, and therefore unfair, expense, and in ' taking the liberty to press upon the commissioners my views. in the hope that they might think fit,' &c., I was exercising the undoubted privilege of sei-defence, andsupportingit in the languae of a gentleman. I knew that we had no appeal from the 3ndicial decisions of the Court, but I believed that we might without presumption observe upon its preparatory acts, and; hke other defendants in other courts, plead for speedy justice or a change of renue. "' But, as the commnissioners ' do not reccgnize in any man this right,' it only remains to me to ask irn Parliament for a public explanation of the course of justice to which I (as a party concerned) object, and, if possibls, also to ascertain in what more fitting form of dictson than that which.I have used tho New Forest Commissioners expect to be addressed by Her Majesty's subjects.

(FROM1 OUR OWN CORRxESPONDENT.) PARIS, TuISDAY, JAN. 8, 6 P.M. I have no reason to believe that the NeuchUtel quarrel will not be pacificaly settled sooner or later, but I doubt whether much progress has been made in it for the last two or three days. France and England are no doubt well disposed, but I doubt whether the latter is desirous of having even the appearance of exercising a pressure on the Swiss Confederation by demuanding the liberation of the prioners. England and France wiUl use their best influence with the King of Prussia for the renunciation of hirights, but it is probable that the Federal Assembly wrill be expected to agree to the previous liberation of the prisoners. There is no doubt that the King has made uD his mind to renounce what he caUs his rights, lut he still demands that the prisoners shaU be previously and unconditionally set at liberty. The day of the trial, the 19th, is rapidly approaching, and if it take place it will be too late for a settlement. In point of fact, the question is now even more than before reduced to one of etiquette. Who will take the first step? The King has become less warlike; the discontent of the population through whose territory he would have to pass, the agitation and alarm along the frontier of Baden and Wurtemberg, whose territories would inevitably be the battle-ground, and the incalculable injury sure to be inflicted on so many in the German States by the interruption of trade and commerce during the hostilities, have had,they say, some influence withhim. He has got into acrape of which he did not anti- cipate all the troubles, and I have little doubt he would be glad to get out of it. The Patrie says, that notwithstanding the probability of an approaching arrangement, the Swiss Confederation continues its military preparations. The effective force of thefirst two divisions of the Federal army which have been caUed into active service amounts to 35,000men,and everywhere freecorps are being formed. A great number of retired officers have sent their names in. 78 pieces of artillery have been sent to Basle for the defence of the Dlace. The staff is shortly to proceed to Zurich, but General Dufour has not yet gone there. The assassin Verger still maintains the same sangfroid as before. Re, however, now affects the character of a leveller-the avenger, rather, of the inferior orders of the clergy. He had iatended, he is represented to have said, to begin by assassinating his old protector and benefactor, the cur6 of St. Germain lAuxerrois, who had been obliged to denounce him for acts of irregmlarity, but he changed his mind, and resolved to make a still greater example. His act he describes as a warning to other prelates how they unadervalue the talents and the merits of the loxFer clergy. Various motives, no doubt, will beWascribed for the murder; but it is easy to see that Verger was a man of strong passions, of immense conceit, and unhappily of a dark, unforgiving, and vindictive spirit. He put forth all his strength in the blow he struck the Archbishop. The robes the Prelate wore whenhemethis deathhave been examined. The poniard pierced the thickly embroidered rose of his stole, his surplice, soutane, and waistcoat, and it split the heart in twain. An ordinary blow might have been warded off by the gold embroidery of the pontifical vestments, but Verger struck with all his might. An immense crowd went to-day and yesterdayfar greater than the day before-to the Archbishop's palace in the Rue de Grenelle St. Germain. It was found necessary to open the doors leading into the chakple ardente at an earlier hour than had been at first fixed. Several low masses were said in the morning, after which the public were admitted, and continued to pass through the rooms during the whole day. Some thousands of persons must have been unable to obtain admission. The papers give the foUowing additional particulars about Verger:- " In 1840, Verger, who was then 16 years of age, was placed in the Ecclesiastical seminary of St. Nicholas at (Gntilly; it was there that he committed the robbery which has already been mentioned. This robbery, which was of 60f., he now denies having committed, and he says that he was expelled from the seminary, not for theft, but for haying in his possession the works of IRacine and Moliare, which he had purchased out of a sum of money (60f.) givea him by the Marquise de Rochefort to buy books for study and de- votion. He states also that at Gentilly he obtained the first prize for good conduct and religious knowledge. After leavng the seminary, Verger succeeded in re-establishing his character suffiiently to obtain employment as seoretary to a priest. This priest enabled him to take the minor orders, then to be ordained deacon, and afterwards priest. Shortly after Verger was appointed cure of the-parish of GuercheviUe (Seine et Marne), but he had frequent altercations with his parishioners about his fees, and he used to say, .' Those fellows, instead of paying me in money, would prefer to pay me by a good beating.' At length the squabbles between him and his flock rose to such a height that he ws summoned before the Procure'r Imperial at Fontainebleau, and was afterwards removed from tha parish. He was then sent as first curate to W,ouarze, but he soon got into qorels with the cur6, and the }te? got rid of him. Verger was then appointed curd $iy Casnois, but he could not live quietly thero. He wade repeated attempte to obtai an appointment in the dioeese of Paris, but did not succeed," The foUlowing private telegraphic deepatoh has been received "TURIN, JAN, 7. "The King, in opening tse Chambers, delivered a aeeech in whioh he alluded to the glorious participation of Piedinont in the war of the East, aad declared ihat the Srdiniau troops had behaved with the greatest gallantry, god merited tea of their country.

They in sure to the country a prosperous and glorious future.' The speech was received withloud applause." The Bishop of Orleans bas addressed a pastoral latter to his clergy, enjoining prayers for the repose of the soul of the late Archbishop of Paris. The following passage is found in the document::- " When such crimes are committed men ask themselves with fear and trembling if great chastisements will not fall on the earth, should it not hasten by penitence to avert tho blow whioh impends from the terrible wrath of the Al. mighty ? Paris, Paris ! Mnst it be, then, that in this interminable series of our calamities the ancient see of your pontiffs is constantly to be inundated, not only by the sweat of their brow, but by their blood I Oh, Providenoe I what, then, is thy secret? Is it the glory of the confessors and martyrs that Thou intendest to again present as a shining example to thy church, or is it the elect of thy irri. tated justice who are to fa before our eyes, the innooent victims of our iniquities?" The curd of St. Etienne-du-Mont, in the name of the clergy of that parish, has addressed a letter to the Vicar-General of Paris, requestine as &I favour that, as the melancholy death of the Archbishop took place in their church, they may be allowed to watch constantly over his remains. The cur6, in further support of the request states that in consequence of the church of St. Edgenne.du.Mont being, for the present closed, the clergy of that parish have less duties to occupy their attantion. The request has been acceded to, A letter from Turin of the 6th inst. observes that, although the Austrians have announced the ap- praching evacuation of the Grand Duchy of r'arma, the evacuation will be more a matter of form than absolute fact. They propoee to maintain a garrison at Placencia; and as long as they remain there they are really masters of the Duchy of Parma. It is true that the Austrians have a right by treaty to occupy the citadel of Placencia, ut the treaties never anticipated that the Emperor of Austria should become the sovereign of all Italy. At any moment that the inhabitants of Parina commit an act to displease the Government the Austrians may agam occupy the duchy. A letter from Rome of the 29th of December states that on the 27th, the Pope's birthday, the coercive measure termed precetto politico which pressed severely on numerous persons had been I abolished. A person to whom the precetto politico was applied could not leave his houie before sunrise and should return home before sunset. He was forbidden to hold intercourse wfith any person subject to the same measure. He could not quit the town in which he resided, or mix in any crowd. The violation of any of its rules was punished by a year's imprisonment. During three or four years the 'measure was enforced with great severity, but for some time past persons to whom the precetto politico was applied obtained some indulgence-for example, they were prmitted to remain out of doors until midnight. ose partial concesaions were called favours. This fact explains why the Austrian papers, particularly the Venbice Gazette announced that the Pontifical Government had published several acts of clemency. It was reported that an amnesty was to be declared on the 8th of December. That day passed without any a-mnesty. It was then announced for Christmasday, and that has passed without anybody hearing a word of an amnesty. It is now said to be deferred to New Year's-day, but few believe in it. The writer gives another fact to show how foreign journalserroneouslyannounce pardonsandmitigation of punishment. Itwaslately announcedinanItalian journalthatseveralmembersof theRomanConatituent Assembly had been amnestied by the Pope, and among others the Chevalier Lolli of Tivoli. MA Lolli was in exile at Marseilles, and petitioned to return for three months to arrange some family affairs. When he arrived at Rome he was persecuted by the police, and, although the Portuguese Minister interceded for him, the police wished to force him to remain the three months at Tivoli, but sooner than do that he returned to his place of exile. Reports of the approaching retirement of Cardinal Antonelli are reviv ig. Car dinal Alfieri is spoken of as his successor m i post of First Secretary of State. The people feel no interest in the change. It is likewrise reported that His Holiness proposes to take a journey into the Marches to meet the Emperor of Austria. A private letter from Madrid of the 3d says:" The news from Catalonia keepe the Government in con - stant alarm, so much so that the letters come by post from Barcelona were not allowed to be distributed for some days. The consequence of the prohibition ;was that the anxiety of the public increased, and that more serious apprehensions were felt than if the truth were known. The fact is that many of the manufacturers cannot furanish work on account of the enormous stock on hand, which they can. not dispose of, owing to the high price of food everywhere. Frequent assemblages of opertives have taken place. They were in the beginning pacific, but have lately assumed an aspectvhich justly cecaons some anxiety to the authorities. You need not be told how customary it is in Baroelona for the working men to the number of 15,000 or 20,000 to make a demonstration in the streets. They are, as you know, intractable and audacious, and but too ready to support their claimas with a high hand. The situation of Valencia is not more encouraging; the city has been placed under martial law. The re-establishment of the octroi duties, so detested in Spain, has been the cause of tho agitation which has prevailed there. The peasants and farmers who are in the habit of supplying the city with provisions no longer do so, on account of that impost. Sentries stationed in the market were forced, and the provisions taken off by force by the people. The population of Valencia are in a state of much alarm from the scantiness of the primary articles of consumption. In the last Cabinet Council, which was presided over by the Queen, Her Majesty spoke rather sharply to the Ministers for not having put an end to the crisis which has existed so long in Catalonia. Hence various rumours of Ministerial crises, which, though they may not be well founded, at all events prove the little certainty of the existence of the Government. With all the affectation of security, it is evident that the Court begins to get afraid, and shows less disposition than previously towards a reactionary policy. A military rising is apprehended, and after or with it a revolution, and it is for that reason that the Queen has refused to consent to the banishment of O'Donnell, anticipating that she may want his aidat some time, and that he will notrefuse it when called upon. The Queen has refused to receive Sartorius, Coliantes, and Domenech, the three most notorious and me6t detested individuals of the Polaco band which fell amid general execration in 1854. Her Majesty has declred more than once her dislike of these men individually, on the ground that after having provoked a revolation they fled and abandoned her. Six Generals have refused to attend the court-martial twhich is to sit in judgment on Brigadierlbana -a well-known mnember of the Moderado party. In aprivate conversation with another military man he hap;ened to riti cize the condauct of General lTarvaez, and the other defended him. The conversation became extremely personal, and a hostile meeting was the result. After the duel was over the Brigadier was called upon officially to give an account of his conduct, and of the offence he had committed of speaking censoriously of a superior. He pleaded the privilege of a private conversaton; but his plea was not allowed, and he is to be brought before a courtmartiaL" A letter from the Indian Seas published in the Moniteur de la Flotte gives some new details relative to the Chinese insurrection. The insurgent army fought a battle on the 6th of November against the Imperialists, and for the first time the latter completely evacuated the town of Shanghai and retired to their ships. The chief of the rebels, inorder to excite the numerous enemies of the reigning Government, representa himself as the last diret descendant of the Mings. The Ming dynasty was overthrown by the Mantehou Tartars, and the first Emperor of that nation commenced his reign in 1644. The reigning Emperor is his descendant, and it is for that reason that his enemies regard his family as a foreign race imposed on China. As soon as the rebel chief Tien-Te was again installed in Shanghai he published the followng curious proclamation:- " Se, too, my first aide-de-camp, having in my same the chief eommand of military affairs, and having been yesterday I3named ebief magistrate of Shanghai in plac of the mastrate who has fled because he dared not meet our eyes, pub- lishle tbis pzoelamation for the purpose of announcing the eefinitive overthrow of tho Tartars and the restoration of I he glorious dynasty of the Kig, who prav the country 17 immortal reigns. Byating as redowe obey the orders Come from Heaven-we likewise obey the desire of the people ermbled round us to exterminate the Mautchou Tartars, and to drive them for ever from the erth. When we care. fully study the emperors of the great dynasy of tLe Kimg, we see that theirexterior and their eldthing wrem handsome and Imposing, in so much s to be able to transmit their features and their remaembrance to 10 generations, while these hideous Tartars, as litUe elegant as they are ignorant of tho principles of justics, arm the caue that we now resemble auimals, which pro-ee that they themselves are not men. " Those obstinate Tartrs have set on our nation a sea' of mifortune which still lsts We have raised the standard nd the sword of justice to exterminto them; in afewr days, having taken the supreme orders, we shall tell the people in what manner they ought to dress themselves, In the meantime let us take grea care of our victorious troops, in order that they may jofully and happily accomplish their great labour. At present Shanghai is a do clining town. Its produoe is insufficient. Our duty is, consequently, not only to provide for the troops, but to see that the people have all that is necessary for them. Formerl7, when a ship arrived in the port, it brought plenty of rice; why not now? I, therefore, aide-do-camp of the General-in-Chief, and for a short time chief magistrate of Shanghai, fear that rice will become as arce as pearls and firewood a scarce as cinnamon, and that we hall not have provisions for a mingle day. For that reason I publish this proclamation, rhiclh shall be scattered like the leaves of the tree to engage the nobility and the people to bring as much provisions as possible to Shanghai, and to invite mer. chanta from all countries to come and trade here, which on the one hand will be good for the Government of the King, and on the other, will jusUy allay the anxieties of the people.

Letters from Naples announce that on the night of the 4th inst. the Neapolitan steam frigate the Charles IIL blew up. She wa about to proceed to Sicily with discharged soldiers. A great number of lives have been lost. Some were saved by an English vessel. Redachid Pasha has concluded a loan of 300,000,000f. with Mr. Wilkins, representing some English capitalists. The loan is negotiated at par, with 3 per cent. interest. TURE15Y. (FROM oDa Owir ooRnMWorn2Zir.) CONSTANTINOPLF,, Dzc, 29. Some changes have taken place in the Ministry. Ali Ghalib Pasha, a son of RedSchid and son-in-lasw of the Sultan, has left the Ministry * and in his stead Mukhtar Pasha, late Minister of Pinance, has been named Minister of the Imperial Rouse and of the Mint. Musa Safeti Pasha goes from the Ministry of Commerce to that of Finance, and Isma'l Paha takes his place in the Ministry of Commerce. Thie chassm-croisez in the more subordinate Ministries-and Finance and Commerce must be counted among them in Turkey-has usually very little inportance in itbelf, for Mehmed understands his department about as much as Mabmond does; but the manner in which such changes take place, and the circumstances -which accompany them, ar very significant sometimes. This is the case in the present invtnce. Redschid Pasha's advent to power could not check the expensive habits of the palace. There was, indeed, no want of promises at the moment when his services were required,but they were soon forgotten, as was proved by two new loans contracted afterwards on the civil list The latone, negotiated with the Ottoman Bank, was taken advantage of by,the Grand Vizier to make humble reuresentations about the necessity of reforming extravagant habits, and putting a liit to the expenditare of the palace. The answer was a dismissal of Ali Ghalib Pasha, who had negotiated the loan, and the above-mentioned changes, which are entirely the work of Court influence. It is difficult to see how a government can be carried on in a time of cris, when almost every institution in the State has to be refonned, while a Damocles' sword is hanging over the head of every member of the Government. The first condition, therefore, which the Grand Vizier made before accepting power was entire freedom in the choice of his Ministry. The late changes were the first infraction of this condition. Although they are trifling in themselves, yet if the principle is once admitted all government must be at an end. No doubt, with the traditions which exist in the Turkish empire, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to fix a limit to Court influence, especially as in late years it has been pushed to an extreme; but if Turkey is to take her place within the pale of European States something must be done in this respect. You will remember that about a year ago a firman came out forbidding the sale of white slaves. This firman was owing entirely to the strong repre. sentations made by the foreign Ambassadors. Redschid Pasha has now resolved by his own wiL and without any pressure from without, to forbid the importation and sale of black slaves likewise. Knowing the ideas which public opinion in Europe attaches to slavery, he makes this concession to it, in spite of the difficulties which he must expect in carrying out a measure which, perhaps, more than the prohibition of the sale of fair CircassianIs, must lead to a complete change inthe domestichabits of the country. Every one knows by this time that slavery in the East is entirely different from that in the West. It is more a kind of adoption; so any arguments which might be used against it in Europe would fall to the ground here, unless one hammers away at the abstract principle that no humau being is entitled to own another. But the aboltion of slavery, whether white or black, must by degrees lead to a thorough change in the domestic habits of the people, and especialy of the great-and this is the impor. 1 tant siae of the question of slavery here. The change which has taken piace in this respect is already considerable. Polygamy, that nightmare of Europeans, is gradually &appearing; wth the exception of a few gentlemen of the last generation, this expensive luxury has been given up by the great maority. No doubt, the contact 'with Europeans had a great leal more to do with this than the actual prohibition of the sale of white slaves, for the hange in this respect began long before the publication of the firman, but the impediments thrown in the way of this traffic, although they can never entirely provent it, help on the move. ment. It will esMecially do a good deal to reduce the number of white slaves which are still kept in all the great harems as companions of the mistrea of the house. As longas there was no law prohibiting the sale of white slaves every one occupying a certain position had to submit to th custom,wrhich required that the harems of great men should be adorned with these expensive articles of luxury. Now there is an excuse for every one wrho really wiihes to reduce his enormous harem expenditure to give a god example. The prohibition of the sale of Circassian slaves will, besides this, work by degtew a change in the system of marrages among the great. It has been hitherto a vert coammon thing for rich men to buy youn children of 7 or 8 years of age, to educate thea m their harems, and to give them away asawiveatotheir sons W il, ihis was donewith the on, the daughtera were sEte givr to men of an inferior condition, not rarely liberated slaves, 'who had attached themselves to the fortunes of the father, and tried to make their career by his influence. The gradual extinction of these cuttoms will promote marriages between equals, and thus draw a stronger line of demarcation between the higher and lower classeg. The prohibition of the importation and sale of black slaves which is now contemplated will act not less porerfully, although differently, on the domestic habits. Indeed, ita influence will be much more extended, for it will not only affect the upper but likewise the lower classes. As the first thought of every woman in Europe who ries in the world is to have her "'maid," so the ambition of every housewife in the East is to have a black slave. As custom forbids a woman in the East to show her face to any man, except her father, brother, or husband, no free Mahomedan woman can be employed as a servant in a harem, where abe would be exposed to the gaze of all the male members of the family. Christian women are likewise inad- iissible, on account of their different habits and mutual prejudices. So the black slaves are the only resource; they form exclusively the servant class of the harems, and do aU the work, while their nistresses rarely or never give any thought to household affairs, and are idling away their time in dreams, or pass it in intrigues. The prohibition of the sale of black slave girls must therefore lead to a complete revolution in the Turkish household system, and must break down the seclusion of the harem far more than anything else. When once the stock of black slaves now existing shall be exbausted and now supplies have more or less ceased, 'urkish women mw u t either do all the work themselves, or ele admit free women into their harems In the beginning these wi al be Christian women, for it wrill be a long time before Mahomeds.n women will consent to live in any but their own harem, but necessity and good pay wldl, of course, at length overcome the ideas prevalent in this respect, and this wi be the first step in a great social revolution. No doubt this will not be the affair of a year or two, and it will be much more difficult at first to prevent the Wale of black than of white slaves; but Redschid Pasha deservee great credit for having conceived the most practical way of gradually overcoming social prejdices, which form the greatest obstacle to all other improyements. I wrote to you in one of my last letters that the affair of the National Bank had been more vigorously taken up, and that orders had been given by the Grand Vizier to the commission which was named for this purpose by the late Ministry to do something decisive. This has been attempted, with what success you will see. As was expected, the commission, after a rather stormy discusaion, came out the day before yesterday with a new project. All the competitors were summoned to the Porte, caUed in separately, and each received a copy of the new project. The project says that the Government, desirous of establishing a bank, will grant an exclusive privilege for 30 years for the formation of an Imperial and National Bank. The capital of the bank is to consist of from 10,000,0001. to 12,000,0001. sterling, of which 8,000,0001 will be appropriated to the redeeming of kaimes, sahims, and beshliks (paper money and debased currency), and the rest for purposes of commerce, industry, and agriculture. The statutes of the bank are to be framed after the model of similar banks in France and England. Adopting, the principle of fusion, the contractors oblige themselves toopen subscriptions in England, France, Germany, and Turkey, and leave these lists open and free to everybody in those countries for a certain time. For all the advances which the bank may make to the Government for the above-named purposes, namely, the redeeming of the paper money and of the debased currency, the Government will pay 6 per cent. at par and no commission. The Government is to appoint the governor of the bank and a limited number of directors; the rest of the directors are to be appointed by the subscribers, in proportion to the sum subscribed by each of the above-named four countries. The contractors are to deposit 200,0001. sterling as a guarantee. The bank is to begin its functions six months after the delivery of the firman. I suppose it will not surprise you to hear that the proposal was received with almost unanimous astonishment. Indeed, three of the competitors, the Ottoman Bank, the agents of the house of Rothschild, and the representatives of the native association, declared immediately that they could not for one momententertain theproposal. Messrs. Wilkins alone, I hear, gave no decided refusal, and promised to consider the project. The first thing which must strike every one who reads the project is, that the men who conceived it must live in a far remote fableland, secluded entirely from the rest of the world, and certainly totaUy ignorant of what is passing in the money market of Europe; for, unless they suppose that the title and privilege of an Imperial Bank in Turkey will lend the possessors the magic wand which gilds everything which it touches, they could not ask the fortunate company to begin its life only with a capital of l0,000,000l. to 12,000,000l You will know far better than we can here how impossible this would be even with the most favourable conditions; how much less, then, with the burdens with which the Imperial and National Bank is to be charged, especially as the mode of raising this large capital is the very way calculated to prevent capitalists from embarking in the enterprise!' There would be, perhaps, capitalists willing to advance, under guarantee, to the Turkish Goverinment the sums required for the withdrawal of the debased 6urrency and other purposes, but if these sums are to form part of the capital of the bank the thing becomes different, and I believe that there will be not many who will lend their money under the condition of being obliged to enter into a commercial speculation of the nature of a bank, and to identify themselves with its ups and downs. Then, to oblige the contractors to take upon themselves from the first moment the withdrawal of the paper money and debased currency to the amoumt of two-thirds of the entire capital, before even this capital is got together, is making the bank, so to say, insolvent before it is constituted. Another not less important objection is the 6 per cent. interest, which the Government promises to pay at par, and without a guarantee to the bank for the advances made for the withdrawal of the paper currency. Even with a Turldsh guarantee, very few will be fools enough to place their money in an enterprise where the greater part of the capital is to be invested at 6 per cent., when they canget 6J_per cent. anywhere in Europe. The fact is, the Turks see that Russia gives only 5 per cent. for railways, but they don't see, it seems, that 16,0001. are promised per mile on a road which on an average will certainly not cost more than 10,000l. But the moat absurdthing i the idea of " fusion," as understood by the commission, prescribing to the company where to get their capital, as if it was not enough to let theem try whether they can get it at all. There would be perhaps no objection to have a governor or commission appointed to see that the statutes of the bank are executed; but how can a company agree to have "the limited" number of directors appointed by the Governm ent, who, ig.- I norant of the a, b, c of finance, would be voting on affairs which "their philosophy never dreamt of ?" Thus it seems to me there is not an article in the project which is not open to the strongest objection, and the whole is a valuable, or rather invaluable, specimen of Turkish financial wisdom. The commission seems to thik that financial reform may be blown up as suddenly as woap bubbles, instead of undersanding that in a country in which such financial disorder ests there must be a moderate begining. Ab~nk witha capital of 2,000,0001. or 3,000,0001., unfettered and independent, is as much as they ought to aim at in the beginning; indeed, the capital would be far more than they could manage in the present state of affairs, for they will have to create a banking business in the European sense of the work, and to break gradually through the irregular and vicious habits1 which prevail inall money trans. actions In orde'lto do this, they must endeavour to establish a standard currency, consequently they would be themselves interested in the withdrawal of the paper and debased currency; and it would be to their interest to get the money for this purpose as soon and as cheaply as possible for the Government. If once the bank were well established and thriving, this could easily be dene by degrees, the bank acting as a mediator, and, so to say, as additional surety for the Government. But totry to improve finances by a magic stroke is nothing more ths. imuing ira. practicable hatti-humayouns, where a piece of paper Is substituted for the powerful agency of time. As I told you above, the project is tho child of the Bank Commal.sion, packed by the late Government and kept up by Redschid Pasha. Wishing to avoid all interference in money matters the Grand V;izier left the commission entirely free, and he had, therefore, nothing to do with the projet; but this affair must convince, him that he must brave all chances of calumny and tale the matter into his own hands, or else expose the country to remain for a long time to come in the wretched financial condition which bows it down at present. AUSTRIA. (FROf OUR0 OWNW OOiBR;PND-Tr.) VIENNt, J . The only news is the foUowing offlcial (teegraphic) Account of the arrival aud sojourn of the Emperor and Empress at Padua:- " Their Majesties entered Padua shortly before 11 'clock on the 3d. A dense crowd ws assembled in th, streets leading to tho Palace Papafava, where apartments hd been prepared for the illustrious traveUers. The windows of the houses in the streets tbrough lwhich the Emperor and Empress passed were fiUed with specators. Their Majesties were receivod with loud acclamations. Inmediately after his arrival the authorities and high nobles waited on the Emperor. After reviewing the garrison, His Majesy visited several of the public offices and institutions. At 4 o'clock the Empross received the ladies of rank In the evening, when the Emperor drove through the streets of the dty to see the illumninations, he was loudly cheered by the people. At a later hour their Majesties went to the Teatro Nuovo. " From 9 til U1 on the 4th (Sunday) private wadiences were granted. At half-past 11 their Majesties went to hear mars in the Church of San Antonio, and afterwards viited some of the public establishmente. At hllf-past 1 o'clock a 'Karowscl was ridden by the offioers of a regiment of Husssrs which is stationed at Padua, and bears the name of the 'E mperor's Own.' After this was at an end their Majesties retired, and were not visible again until the evening, when they went to the theatre." The Karowssel is a kind of tournament, in which the horsemen display their dexterity in thrusting the heads of their lances through suspended rings, and their strength bydecapitating pasteboard figures representing Moorish infidels and negroes. SWITZERLAND. A letter from Berne, of the 6th inst., states that the terms of the mediation that Colonel Barmann aud the Councillor of State Kern are commissioned to propose to the Emperor of the French are, that the Swiss Confederation shalrelease the prisoners onthe assurance that the Emperor will induce the King of Prussia to renounce his right to the suzerainty of NeuchMtel. A number of manufacturers of Cannstadt, following the example of the merchants of Stuttgardt; have sent an address to the King of Wurtemberg against the passage of Prussian troops. The mumicipalcouncils of Ravensberg and Tuttlingen have acted in a sinilar manner, and the feeling continues to spread rapidly. The following is the text of the proclamtion of the Federal Council of Switzerland, of which a summary has already appeared in our columns:- "Dear and faithful Confederates,-On the morning of September 3, last year, Switzerland was surprised in the midst of peace by the news, equally strange and unexpected, that a Royalist conspiracy had broken out in the canton of NeucbhtteL However incredible this news might appear, it neverthless was only too trie. "A band of partisans of the old order of things had during the night taken possession of the city, and the edifice in which the Government of Neuchltel holds its sittings. The members of the State-Council had themsdves been arrested, and the re-establishment of the old order of things, set aside for the last nine years, was announeod by a proclamation. IAs might have been foreseen, this insurrection which had not the slightest chanee of success, was stifled in its birth. When the great majority of the inhabitants of the canton of Neuehlstel had recovered from their surprise, the citizens of all parties in the canton colleeted under the republican banner; and even before the Confederation could interfere the phantom of a restoration of the prineip;lity of NeuchAtel and Valangin had disappeared, and the constitutional state of things was re-established. "The Federal Assembly of the Confederation, duly appreciating the high significance of this manifestation, and making itself the organ of popular opinion, resolved, by an unanimous vote, on the 26th of September, that the republicans of the canton of NeuchAtel had deserved well, not only of their own canton, but of all Switzerland. "The victory obtained on the 4th of September over the Royalists was characterized by clemency and moderation. The greater portion of the prisoners were set at liberty very shortly after the commencement of the inquiry, and the leaders of the insurrection, who are now in a state of confinement, were treated with All possible humanity. "Switzerland, however, aoon found herself exposed to demnands, made upon her with no other motive than that of nullifying the judicial inquiry and preventing the punishment of the guilty. As arecognition of the King of Prussia's rights over Neuchitel was demanded the immediate and unconditional liberation of all the prisoners. "We considered that it was out of our power to accede to these demands without at the same time renouncing the nationfs sights of sovereignty, and without sanctionin the princdple that it is lawrful for a party to distrb the public peace wvith impunity, and to overthrow in any one canton the constitution and constitutional order guaranteed by all the other cantons, as well as by the Feseral charter. "For the due understandin of the peculiar and complicated relations in which the country of NeuchAtel existed during a number of years it ig necessary to take a rapid glance at the recent history of this country. "By the treaty of May 19, 1815, the canton of NeuchAtel was, in the capacity of a sovereign State, incorporated with Switzerland, and its rights anidauties vere to be identical with those of the remaining cantons. In return certain rights over that country, reserved by other European treaties, remained with the King of Prssia, who had been, in 1707, elected Prince of NeeuchiteL "The unnatural shte of things created by this double position of canton and principality was manifested before Ong i3t several instances; and on more than one occasion attempts were made to bring under relations to the Confederation more rational a canton, the development of which was constantly impeded by the inconvenience attending this double position. "These attempts met with the desired result only in 1848. The people at that time knew how to make use of their right to constitute themselves freely, by adopting the form, and giving themselves the republican constitution, wvhich wvas fully guaranteed by al the States of the Confederation. "M More than onoe since that period the Federal authority has endeavoured to come to an understanding through the medium of friendls negotiations with His Majesty the King of Prussia, hut all these efforts failed owing to the pretension set up that the old order of things should before everything be re-established-a requirement that we couldnot countenance in any event without repudiating the canton of Neuchgtel from our union, and repuditing also the principles of the new Federal constitution. "Such was the state of things when a solution of the difficulty, which could not be obtafntd in a friendly manner, was on the 3d of September attempted by violence. "H However disposed one might be to regret the fate of men who, by rash zeal and chimerical hopes, had suffered themselves to be led on to commit such an act of violence, it was not possible to interfere with the course of judicial roedings, and as it were to sanction for a oertain party byothe unconditional liberation of Vhe insurgents, a privilee right to insurrection. I Although the rights of sovereignty possessed by the Confederation and the canton of NeuchAtel did not allow us to talke into consideration the pretensions that had been raised, nevertheless we manifested our serious intention of setting the prisoners at liberty, provided a single condition were fulfiled towards Switzerland. We declared ourselves ready to grant the liberty of the prisoners in case the hberation of the canton of lTeuchatel from every foreign tie should be acknowvledged, thus putti an end to a state of things which had every day shown itself to be more and more untenable. " We declared ourselves ready to meet half-way any negotiations that should be calculated to bring about the independence of NeuchAtel. That we might not wound, even in the slightest degroe, the suscptibilities of the adverse party, we declared, besides, our readiness to take into consideration the propossal of rAediation made by other Powers. The course taken in these long negotiations has been correctly and fully exlained in our messape to the Federal Assembly; and the Swriss people will, as impartial history likewisoe wi do hereafter, give us their testimony that we have refused no means in our endeavours to bring the dispute to an advantageous and mefic result. * All these effort,which evinoe our good-will and loyalty, have hitherto failed, owing to the demand made for the preliminary and unconditional liberation of the prisonersa demand to which we oould not submit without humiliating Switzerland and impairing her honour. "' When our situation became more difficult, and our adversary prepared to support his Vretemions by force of arns, it appeared to us that it was time to appeal to the re preesntative of the nation, and learn from them wbether the Federal Council had or had not acted in accordance with the nstional opinion. 'I On the 30th of December the Federal Asembly unanimously passed the following rolutions - " ' Art. L In order to effect a paCific solution of the NKei chltel gquestion, the Federal Council will continue to do Its part, as it has hitherto done, for the adoption of all or any means compatible with the honour and dignity of Switzerland, and such as mby be fitting for procuring the recognition of the independence of Nench&tel from every foreign tie.

All hope of a pacific solution, indeed, has not disppeared; we he endeavour, even now, to do our part for the maintenauce of peaco whenerer there shall be found for the attainment of that ject a course not prejudicial to our houour.

SlR ROBERT PEEL ON RUSBIA. TO THE1 EDITOR OF TE1D TIMES. Sir,-I trust yon vl allow me, in case of any one else failing to do so, to briefLy comment on a few of the sentiments and the language of the address on Russia which Sir Robert Peel delivered the other evening at Birmingham, and which was reported in tie kimes of yesterday, Whatever notice may be taken of his use of slang, his injv. diciousness and excessive freedom and flippancy of remark with respect to highly-plced personage", his utteranoe in public of such sentiments as are contained in the following passages of his address ought not to be allowod to pass without calling forth some expression of disapprobation, The pace at wbich Sir Robert and party travelled by post from Moscow to Nishni was indeed " tremendous;" it was killing,-" 400 miles in 28 hours-15, 16, and 17 miles per hour frequently P" Yet fast as this pace was, it was not fast enough for the hon. baronet - "We were in the second carriage," says Sir Robert, "and I once made agns to our nchly-dressed director that we were not goin fast enough, and that the first carriage wvas outstripping us. He immediately rose from bis seat, dggd tern man from the box, and cast him on the ground, nearly kIdlling him." Well may Sir Robert say that he " took care not to complain gain;" for, if he may not be to blame for the pace at which they travelled-a pace which would appear to be a usual one in Russia-he is at least responsible for any conse. quences that may have resulted from urging the man in charge to increase the already neck-break spoed with which they were going, and the poor fellow who was thrown from the carriage, solely in consequence of Sir Robert's sifUs or gestures, could not be so throwrn off without sustaining serious hurt. Did Sir Robert, on his return, make any in quiry about the poor fellow, and offer him any compensation ? " Thero was no postillion roady for one of the six horses when we stopped at one posthouse, but the director in gold insisted that we must have six horses and six riders; and, to suppl the vacancy, rushed into the crowd which had colected, seized tho first person, put him upon the horse, and started off again. The man had no stockings or shoes on, but that did not matter; he soon got into a dreadful state from riding, and dropped of the animaL. The horses frequently became tired, and when they fell exhausted owre left by the roadside. The poetboys suffered the same treatment when they became unable to perform their duties'" and, Sir Robert added-" I do not think I ever enjoyed travelling EO in my Is these, then, anything in beholding poor animals being driven so bard that they fall dow n exhausted, and of poor fellows falling from the animals from sheer physical suffer ing, and being left by the roadside, it may be to perish that can excite feelings of pleasure in the breast of an; man? There must be something of the kind, since one so gently nurtured and tender-hearted as this young baronet can contemplate the sufferings of both man and horse with feelings of positive pleasure, and is not ashamed to declare that he never enjoyed anything so much in his life ! Sir Robert and party cannot allege any State duty in excuse of so much suffering; they had none then to perform; they were going to look at the great fair of Nishni What sufferings merely to gratify an idle curiosity, and what insensibility to the sufferings of others to avow how intensely ha enjoyed a mode of travelling so distressing and dangerous to toth horse and rider I Not one word of Pity for the horse or msn I Any other man than Sir Robert would feel pain, and not pleasure, at witnessing such incidents of suffering. "' What delighted us most was going into the fair. We saw Kalmucks and lovely Circaesians, the latter being particularly engaging, and I was nearly engaged twice by some of them." Sir Robert, it is well known, has enjoyed great educational advantages and facilities, but his predilection for slang would little lead one to suppose so. How the word3 " sof t sawdoer" and " brick" grace an oration I What an unr meaning metaphor is that of " brick r Sir Robert " novesaw such a brick a6 the Governor" of the theatro at Nishni Is the word " brick," as here used, a cemplimentary term or the reverse of one ? Whot associations are to be awakennd by it ? Is Sir Robert himself a brick ? 3ir Robert Peel speaks of " quantities of money," "a quantity of orks of art," and even of " an enornons qanUtityof footmen" Is the distinotion, then, betweoon things quantitative nd things numerable sO nice that Sir Robert cannot perceive it? Any one not a " brick"V would h&ve raid "imms" of money, a " number" of works of Art, and a "great number" of footmen. It may be a matter of indifference to Sir Robert whethtr he expresses himself in aeademic phrasoology or in street slag in private, but it bomes another affair when he addrewa the public. When one of his influence and social anlcstw ineorrect language or downright slang it ia an en. eoVashmtentib oohers lees advantagously circunastAncedi to do thl same.

PARKE FOR THE SOUTH-EASTERN PORTi-OSS OF TilE METIRPOLIS. Mr. DRXW presented a memorial from the parishes of Bermondsey, St. George the Martyr (Southwark), SD. Olave's, and Rotherhithe, in reference to the formation of a park for the south- eastern portions of the metropolis. A deputation from the parishes was then introduced. Dr. IuSALLicE (on behalf of the deputation) said he was anxious to address a few words on the subiect of the memorial, because the inhabitants of Southwark felt that their claims had not been so favourably regarded as those of other districts had been. The population of Southwark and the adjoining parishes, which would participate in the benefits of the proposed park, was, by the lat return of the 3o%rd of ,1ealth (which, although not an official document, was one r-:cat might be relied on), about 250,000. That was a very dense population. He held in his hand an official map, published by the Board of Health, showing the area which suffiered from the vistation of the cholera. The Cn.iLUMx?S.-It is called, I believe, the " cholera Dr. CuALUCEm-Yes; and it was a most instructive map. Now, he apprehended it was in the power of the board to take measures which would prevent the recurrence of that epidemic disease. The map pointed out the spots where the cholera raged with the greatest viralence. The locality was still very bad, but it was now much better than formerly. In order, however, that it should not again become the seat of that terrible scourge it was the duty of the Board to obtain open spaces, where practicable, that purer air might be ell yed by the inhabitants. There was at present available, or that purpose a considerable portion of land which was at present occupied and used as market gardens, only without any buidings being erected thereon. It was sit'-| ated on the north, of the main Kent-road, and was about 100 acres in extent. It formed a portion of the lowest part of :london, and if not secured for the purposes of a park would, no doubt, be soon covered with houses of an inferior description. Its situation was analogous to that of St. Jamues's Park; and he would ask the board what would be the condition of that part of Westminster if St. James's Park, instead of being left open, were covered with small houses, occupied by a dense population of the poorest class? lie considered this to be a question which required no discussion, nor admitted of any delay. The memorial contained the signatures of between 1,100 and 1,200 persons, including those of the principal merchants, bankers, and traders residing in that portion of the metropolis. He thought the memorialists had a most especial claiL'. on the representatives of the city in that Beard, because the larger portion of Southwark consisted of men who worked in the city and who went over to Southwrark to reside. It was a fact that all the improvements going on in the city of London, by the formation of new streets, and the necessary pulling down of a smaller description of buildings, had the effect of driving a large number of people over to the other side of the water, thereby rendering the population still more crowded. The Board would pardon him for ur gi immediate steps to be taken in this matter, for if the land now available were not secured and made a lung, as it were, to Southwark, it would be impossible to tell what the consequences might be some eight or ten years hence. The Board was in the position of a General whom this enemy had once taken by surprise, and who was liable at any time to the renewal of a similar attack. If they now failed to take the necessary means to keep off the epidemic disease, the responsibility would fall, and justly fall, on them alone. (Hear, hear.) As an argument against delay he would state that the ground which it was desirable to obtain was becoming more valuable every day, and would no doubt be made the site of new and of still more crowded buildings. A very important report had been published by the medical officer of the parish of St. George, showing how much greater was the increase of the cholera in places wvhere there was a dense population than in the more thinly inhabited localities. The importance, however, of securing open spaces, not only for the district of Southwark, but for the metropolis at large, could not for a moment be disputed. The memorialists, however, claimed not to be exclusively taxed for this work. (Hear, hear.) They considered themselves to be only a part of the whole of the metropolis, and ought not to pay more than a fair proportion of the expense. They had waited patiently and quietly irn the expectation that the Board would of themselves take the initiative in such a matter-naturally supposing that their own instincts would have pointed out to them that the vacantspace to which the memorialists referred ought to be made available for so important a parpose as the promotion and preservation of the health of the people. With regard to the extent of ground to be converted into a park, lie understood that the acreage calculated for other localities was one acre for every 1,000 inhabitants; that would require for the population of Southwark 250 acres. They did not, however, ask for any such sDace but would be content with much less. He would, in conclusion,t point out to the Board that the ground which the memorialists were anxious to obtain was situate in that part of the metropolis which was suffering more than any other in consequence of a want of drainage, if therefore the ground should be allowed to be covered with houses that evil would be greatly increased. The CILAIRAI,N said the whole question of forming parks for the inhabitants of the metropolis was already before the Board, and had been referred to a committee, who would make their report on Friday next. The Board felt the importance of the question, and the deputation might be assured that due attention would be paid to the subject of their memorial. On the motion of Mr. DREw, seconded by mr. OFFOR, the memorial was referred to the Committee of Works and Improvements. COÂ£PENSSATION FOR LOSS OF OFFÂ£CE. The Board was occupied the greater portion of the day in considering the decisions of various vestries and district boards with respect to claims of compensation for loss of office in consequence of the passing of the Metropolitan Local Management Act. The number of appeals and claims disposed of yesterday were 23, the parties appealing and claiming being clerks, collectors, surveyors, inspectors, messengers, street-keepers, and gulley-shoot cleaners. The amount of the sums awarded and appealed against varied from 371. 10s. per annum for life to 51. per annum for five years. The effect of the appeal in the case of the 31 l, 10s. annuity was to raise the compensation to b0L. a-year. The general rules laid down by the Board are that half the amount of salary shall be granted for life to pcrsons above 60 years of age and who have served 10 years and upwards; to persons 50 lears of age and 10 years' service a quarter of the amnount of sa1aryand to persons under 50 years, having served 10 years, a quarter of the amount of salary for 10 years; and those who hiave served less than 10 years a quarter of the amount of salary to be paid for the same number of years as they may have served. The reports of the engineer and superintending architect were then received. OXFORD-STREET. An application from the vestry of the parish of St. Marylebone,that the whole of Oxford-street may be placed under the exclusive management of that vestry, was heard at some length. It appears that the boundary line between St. Marylebone, on the north, and St. James's, St. George's, Hanover-square and St. Ann's, Soho, on the south, passes down the centre of Oxford-street and that the duties of paving, lighting, and cleansing have for a great number of years been discharged by the vestry of St. Marylebone, the other parishes contributing towards the expenise. This was an application for an order of the Board to continue and sanction that arrangement; but an objection was raised by Mr. Lewis, the vestry clerk of St. Ann's, who said that the boundary of St. Ann's was not conterminous with that of St. Marylebone, but that a space of ground intervened belonging to the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, of which parish St. Ann's formed a part until it was erected into a distinct parish by a statute of Charles II. The question being one of some difficulty, the consideration of it was postponed for a month, due notice tbereof to be in the mean time given to the authorities of St. Martin'sin-the-Fields. NOTICES OF MOTION. Mr. Hows gave notice of a motion that the Committee on Sites of Offices be forthwith dissolved. Mr. D'IFFANOSR gave notice that on the bringing up of the report on the street nomenclature he should move that the portion of the New-road between Edgeware-road and Osnaburgh-street be called Marylebone-road ; that the nortion between Osnaburg street and Tottenham-court-road be caUed Pancras-road west, the portion between Tottenhamcout-road and King's-cross be caUed Pancras-road east, and the portion between King's-cross and the Angel Inn at Islington be called Pentonville-road, and that all the separate names at present existing therein be abolished. 'na+ in4., c -e severa poriono the Ne-r an in all Thnat ir the- several portion-s of -t-he ev-dadin all the streets hereafter construoted or renamed the numbering be consecutive throughout, coinmencing at the end nearest St. Panl's Cathedral, with the odd numbers on the left hand, and the even numbers on the right. 'lThe Board then adiourned.
FOSSILS and SEA BEACH al UPPER CLAPTON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. `iir,-Perhaps the fossil collectors who have overwhelmed y,ar'Bnakingham correspondent, W. Stowe, whose letter Appears in your columns of to.day, may feel interested in the fact that, in excavating for the sewers on the new London road now forming to shorten the distance from cen. tral Essex and the Lea-bridge-road to the metropolis, the -workmen havo within tbe last few days, at a depth of about 20 feet, dug into a bed of seasand, containing numerous shells, both univalves and bivalves of snpposed extinct species, commingled with 'what appears to be drift wood in large pieces, now quite black, thus evidencing that at some period of our world's history the seashore reached to Uper Clapton. For those cunious in the rnatter I may add that the site of this discovery is not far from where Clapton-gate formerly stood-for that barbarian barrier, with its antediluvian gatehouse, is, if not fossilized, at least disintegrated, and now, like the inhabitants of the said uni and bi valve among the " things that were, but are not"-and onai7es new line of road thas thrown open opposite its site, proceeding west and south-west towards Llndon.

COUBT OF BANKKUPTCY, BasinghaVstreA, Jan. 9. IN RE HUMVPHREY EROWVN. i P (Before Mr. Commtnusoncr EvA.N-s. This was a petation to annul the adjudication of bankruptcy against Mr. Brown. Air. Roxburgh, instructed by Mr. Tucker, appeared for Mr. Brown ; Mr. Joseph Brown, instructed by Messrs. Linklater and Eackwood, appeared for the petitioning creditors; the assignees of the Royal British Bank, in eupport of the adjudication. MIr. ROXBURGH having stated that he admitted nothingneither the petitioning creditorg' debt, nor the act of bankrupitoy, Mr. Wyatt, a clerk of the Royal British Bank, was called, who deposed that he had kept the passbook produced of Mr. Brown's account. It was made up from Mr. Brown's checks. The last date at which Mr. Brown drew any check upon the bank was July 31, 1856, for 6281. The last tim hebaid in auything to the credit of his account was on the I 22a of August, 1856, when he paid in some bills. The hank closed its doors on the 3d of September. The amount in the passbook as due to the bank at the time of the stoppage was 7,9971. 18s. 3d. That debt was exclusive of a security account, of which he knew nothing. In reply to Mr. RoxBuRGu, the witness said the credits were made up from Mr. Brown's slips, as placed on a file. If any of those slips had been lost off the file they would not appear in the passbook. It appeared from further evidence that the last time Mr. Brown had admitted the accuracy of the passbook was on the 2Sth of February, 1855, when he affixed the sagnature " E. B." in the book produced. Mr. Brown had had the passbook as lately as the 29th of November, 1855. The credits in the passbook produced were made from Mr. Brown's own slps, whom he had not seen since the beginning of 1856. Mr. Norcutt, solicitor, objected to answer certain questions touching an action that had been brought against hr. Brown. He had only acted in the matter as agent for another solicitor. His clerk had absconded, and he wished to be released from attendance to-day as soon as possible. Mr. ITANLATgR said it was clear that every possible difficulty would be raised to the adjudication. To prosecute it successfully would probably occupy six weeks, and occasion an expenditure of 2001. Four important witnesses, whose evidence was desired to-day, kept out of the way. Mr. Brown was not to be found. Two persons, builders, named Chandler, to whom he had given bills of sale, had left the place to avoid the service of summonses. Others had done the same, and he would prefer abandoning the resent petition and obtaining an adjudication on the aobts of another creditor. This could be obtained at a cost of 201., and with but little delay. Mr. BROWN said the fact was, Mr. Brown's debt to the bank, after giving credit for the securities held, was nearly double the amount that had beer already given in evidence. Mr. TUCEER said he must deny that a debt existed at alL Mr. LIrIxAiTxE gave the name of a client to whom Mr. Brown was indebted upwards of 3,0001. Mr. Tuc.EEB denied that such a debt existed. Mr. LmxLATEP_-It is as I have stated. There are also other debts as due to other parties than the bank. Mr. Brown, by resisting this petition, is only putting off the evi day. Mr. RoxBuRCH asked for costs. Hr. LINKLATER objected, and mentioned several circumstances in order to show that the opposition to the adjudication was not of a character to entitle Mr. Brown to costs. His HONOUR said, the petitioning creditors' debt had been satisfactorily proved, and he would make no order for costs. The adjudication was then annulled. (Before Alr. Commissioner HoLROYD.) IN :lE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. 3Mr. ROXBURGE, on behalf of Mr. Humphrey Brown, who was desirous to annul the adjudication of bankruptcy against the bank, said he wished to present a petition with that object. A similar petition had been presented by Mr. Marcus, but he trusted this would be more successful. He asked the Court to name a day for the petition to be beard. He presumed the Court would afford every facility for a petition to be brought before another tribunr , and if a day were now fixed the petition could be presented in 24 hours. The CommisSIoNER.-The first thing to do is to present a petition. th.RO RGt.-Am I to understand, your Honour that as soon as a petition is presented the application fora day of hearing will be granted ? His HONOUR.-Yes. You may present your petition and take the order as of this day. (Before Mr. Commissioner FANE) TN RBE W. R. RUSSELL. The bankrupt was a blacking manufacturer of No. 30, Strand. His accounts have been already published in The Times. This was the examination meeting. Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees, and Mr. Chidley for creditors. An adjournment was ordered for a month. IN RE R. FEAST. The bankrupt was an oil and Italian warehonseman of Finsbury-pavement, and elsewvhere. H's debts and liabili. hes are nearly 32,0001. * the assets arc about 9,0001. There have been alleged losses to the amount of 18,5341. by conIsiments, bad debts, and realization of property. pt passed his examination, Mr. Linklater appearing for the asgnees. IN RE R. BARER. The bankrupt was a merchant, of Lime-street. His debts are about 13,0001.; the assets are very trifling. -Mr. CHinLEY tendered a proof for upwards of 2,001. on behalf of Messrs. Pim and Co., corn merchants, of Dublin. Mr. PLE5WS opposed on the ground that Messrs. Pim had the bankrupt in custody as security for the debt. Mr. CHIDLEY said, he had received notice from Mr. Plews of his intention to apply for the bankrupt's release. He was prepared to consent to the release, and Mr. Plews could notrecede from his motion. Proof admitted. Mr. PLEWS tendered a proof for 3,1001. on behalfof Messrs. Laing and Campbell, colonial brokers MIr. CHIDLEY objected. Messrs. Laing and CampbeU were the agents for others, not the principals inthe case no debt was due to them, His HONOUR allowed the proof, and assignees were appointed.
IYSOLVR)ZT DElBTORS COURT. Jan 9. LS RE BENJAMN LEVY. (Bcl?re, Arr. ooj?m?zgtujn" I?rTrp puv I - solvenT naa oeen a clotbier and tailor at Bolton, Lancashire. He was opposed on behalf of Messrs. Hyams, of King-street, Cheapside, who were creditors to the extent of 5211. The insolvent had commenced dealing with Messrs. Hyams in April, 1853, and a few days after their first transaction he gave a bill of sale to his brother, who put it in force in June last, and took all the insolvent's property. After some inquiry the learned CoumissIoNER thought e attendanceof the insolvent's brother was absolutely necessary, and for that purposa adjourned the case until the 3d of February. (Bcfore thec Cnsr ComÂ£ssIol;1E3) IN RE LEON GUILLEMANB. This insolvent applied for his final order. Mr. MAcRAE appeared for a creditor to ask for some portion of the insolvent's income to be set aside. It appeared that he was a fencing-master, and in that capacity hadgiven lessonsto the present Emperor of the French when resident in this country. His Majesty had lately conferred a pen. sion of 801. a-year unon hima After some discussion the CO1JRT fixed 181. per aunum as the sum to he paid into court by the insolvent.
POLICE. ,UnSION-HOVUSX-The LouD MAYOB, upon taking his seat, said,-I wish to make a communication with respect to what took place in this court yesterday in the case of a prisoner named "Paul," in which some witnesces from the Bank of London were examined. The directors and manager of that bank altogether disapprove the manner in which one of the witnesses conducted himself, and they have addressed a letter to me which, injustice to that highly respectable body of gentlemaen, I think it proper to read to the pablic, t is as follows:- " Bank of London, Threadneedle-street, City. My Lord Mayor,-My attention was drawn this morni-g to remarks which your Lordship is reported to have nmade yesterday at the Mansion-house, reflecting upon the mninner in whioh a clerk in this bank gave his evidencc before your Lordship. " Having waited upon your Lordship this morning, I find that the reports contained in the papers are substantially correct with respect to the conduct and manner of the clerk in question, and I beg leave to inform your Lordship that I have felt it my duty immediately to suspend him from his employment, until the board shall have had an opportunity of dealing with the case. " I need not assure your Lordship that I shall be prepared at any amount of inconvenience to make arrangements to further the ends of justice, so far as the attendance of any of the officers of this bank is concerned, and I shall feel greatly obliged if the solicitors who have the management of the case will in future communicate with myself directly, affording me reasonable notice of their requirements, so that while the ends of justice are promoal the service of the public in this bank may not be prejudiced. I have the honour to be, my Lord Mayor, your Lordship's very obedient servant, "IdX M-AnsmuA,L, Jun., Manager. The Right Ron, the Lord Mayor &c." I am quite satisfied that the Bank will take the same view of the matter - that they will never give any encouragement to their clerks, or any one else, to impede the ends of justice in any investigation that may be going on by the manner in which their evidence is given. The impression of the Court was the same as my own, that the gentleman was exceedingly indifferent in the manner in which he gave his evidence upon that occasion. stichael Dacey, an impudent feUow, was charged with stealing a Poket-handkerchief. GeorgLegg, constable No. 440, said,-Ycsterday afternoon I eaw te prisoner in company with a boy following a gentleman in King William-street, whose pocket they several times attempted to pick. I followed them into St. Swithin's-lane, and saw the boy take this handkerchief (produced) from the gentleman's pocket. I seized both of them. They struggled very much and my hat was knocked off. I called upon some bystanders to assist me in securing the prisoners, but they stood passively by and allowed one of them to escape from me. The LORD AYOR.-Were you in plain clothes ? Iegs.-Yes, my Lord; but the persons wvho atood by knew sme to be an officer, and I told them in addition that I was one when I asked them to assist me. Ofthhe L?OBD MYoR.-Can ou mention the names of any Leggs.-Mr. Seaward a carnian, was one who refused to asist me, although I toid him I was an officer. The gentleman who was robbed, and whose handkerchief is here, al8o refnused to render me any assistance. The LORD MAYOR said, it was hardly credible that persons cguld stand quietly by and see a thief escape from the hands of the officer 'who had two determined fellows to coutend with. The prisoner was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, Nith herd labour. GUILDIAL-Yesterday having been ppointed for tbe further investigation of the charges ainst Mr. 8irr Edward Pack Barber, the ecretary to the Samaritan Institution, for obtaining goods under false pretences with intent to defraud Messrs. Huntley and Palmer, of Reading; Mesrs. Hoare and Co., of Lower East Smithfield; Kesass. Manners and Wells, of Whitechapel, and Mrs. Ponsford and Co., of the CiFlourmills, the examination was resumed before Mr. Joyce said, he regretted that Mr. Barber was so ill that he was confined to his bed, and he was in such a precarious state arising from the mental anxiety attending these proceedings that the medical man had given a certificate of his state, and refused to allow any one, even his attorney, to see him. Under these circumstances the defendant was unable to appear. Mr. Sleigh said, he was very much grieved to hear that Mr. Barber's illness had been produced by the manner in which he had conducted the prosecution, because he felt e h done so as became professional man entrasted with such an important public matter. Sir P W. CAisss said, such a surmise as that which fr. Sleigh complained of was utterly without foundation. Mr. reatrex, a surgeon of Ifolborn, then said-I attended . S. 1B. P. Barber, and the followring is the certificate I gave -~ " I hereby certify that I have been called in to attend Mr. S. E. P. Barber of the Samaritan Institution, who is suffering from an attack of angina pectoris, and quite unable to attend in the Court at Guildhall, nor do I think it probable he will be well enough to do so for some days. "2 AUGSTUS GP.XATREX, M.R.C.S. and L.S.A. 23, Holborn-hill, Jan. 9." Sir Bi. W. CARDEy.-When do you think he will be able to attend-in the course of a week? Mr. Greatrex.-It is quite uncertain, Sir. Sir R. W. CARDEN.-IS tho attack then dangerous I Mr. Greatrex.-It may be. Some have died from similar attacks. With regard to Mr. Sleigh's obeervations, I wish to remark that Mr. Barber told me that this attack was brought on by mental anxiety -while attending the numerous examinations that have tken place in this matter, and not in consequence of any personal obeervations from Mr. Sleigh. Sir P. W. CARDEKN said, it was impossible to proceed with this inquiry in the absence of the defendant, and it only remained therefore to fix a day for the further hearing of the case. Mr. Sleigh said, he should be engaged at the Old Bailey all next week in the gold robbery and Great Northern Railwvay frauds, *o that Saturday week would be the only day that he should be at all likely to be at liberty. Mr. Bodkin, who happened to be in court, intimated that the cases aluded to ould not be concluded by Saturday 31r. Joyce said, it would be better to fix Saturday week, and perhaps Mr. Barber would then be able to attend, Sir R.. Wa.ARDEN said, the case should be remanded until that day, and Mr. Greatrex would in the interim report upon the state of Mr. Barber, so that all parties might be prepared to go on with the case, or there would be a further adjournment, if it should be necessary. The hearing was adjourned accordingly. Alderman HAL requested the press to acknowvledge the receipt of 20 guineas trom the Drapers' Company for the MARLDOROUG5I-SThE.-For the poor.box.-Received from "B. E " the half of a 51.-note; "W. P.," INs.; and "W. H. S.," 5s. ARxYLunoNx.-George Skinner, aged 17, was brought up by Bow, 383 S, and placed at the bar before hlr. LoNG, charged with having been concerned with two others in a burglary committed on the 5th nlt. at the house of 31r. Marshfield, the laudiord of the Sailors' Return, 52, Cochrane-terrace, Portland-town, and stealini a goldwatch, a gold piard, two coats, and many other articles of different descriptions. The other prisoners, Willian Britton and Alfred Wheeler, were on the 1st inst. taken into custody by Sergeant Glass, 3 E, for loitering aboat in a suspicious manner on the night before in the vicinity of Grosvenor-square. They were taken to the Ifarlborough-street Police-court, when, as Britton had in his possession a gold watch, guard, and key of which he was unable to give a satisfactory account, he and his companion were remanded until the following Thursday. They were brought up again on that day, when it turned out, upon inquiries made by the sergeant, that the watch and guard were a portion of the pro perty abstracted from Ir. 3Marshfield's premises. The magistrate tken remanded Britton and Wheeler until Thursday next for examination at this court, it being the district in which the offence took place. Bow (the officer) produced as a witness a boy named James George Colins, who sald,-I am errand boy to gr. Marshfield. On the night before the robbery, which was the 5th of December, the prisoner and two other lads were sitting together in the taproom. There were three more there playing at cards. Some of the boys went out at 10, and the prisoner remained behind. I got a candle to take upstairs with me to bed, and the prisoner then went out. The others had also left the room. On the next Sunday I saw the prisoner and the other two who had been with him in the taproom go into a pieshop in Crawford-street. I went in with them, and he sat down and called for some pies. One of the boys isaid to the Prisoner, " What a - fool you were for going outside the place where we had it off," and prisoner said, "Ah, but it won'thappen again." Bow, 383 S, stated, that after the remand at Marlboroughstreet Police-court on the previous day (Thursday), in consequence of information which had been received, and which left no doubt in his mind as to the complcity of the prisoner tin this burglary, he succeeded in apprehending him (prisoner) near Mountstreet. Mr. LONG (to Bow, the constable).-Have you any other vitnesse presentX Bow.-No,yor Worship. Prisoner.-I wrote to tell your Worship the whole truth. hr. LOiG.-You are not bound to say anytbing, but you can do so if you think proper. Prisoner.-On Friday evening, the 5th of December, Collins came down Spring-street, and asked me And Wheeler to go with him to Cochrane-terrace, St. John's-wood, where he works. Wheeler told Britton that he and Collins were going to break into a house in Albemarle-street, and Colins said tome " Vhat do you say to ' cracking ' my master's crib e" I told him I would have nothing to do with it, and Wheeler said, "Then Ill get Britton." Wheeler then went round to where Britton lived, and told him that he had a " crib to crack " where Colins worked. Britton went upstairs and brought down thr& chisels and a hammer. They persuaded me to go to Cochrane-terrace, and I did so. We got there at 10 minutes to 9 o'clock, and sat in the taproom till a little after 10. Collins came into the room and said to Britton, "Are you ready?' Britton said, " Yes," and he and Collins went out of the taproom together. Collins took Britton upstairs anu put him under his bed, and afterwards he took Wheeler upstairs with himn, and did the same. After this he returned to the taproom, where I was sitting by myself, and asked me to play at cards, but I told him [ did not understand any game. He thensaid, "rillearnyoun. We hadjustsat down whenMrts. Marsbfield came inand said, "Itistime for youladsto go." I wished Collins good night and left the house. I got home at 20 minutes past IL The next morning, at 10, Britton called me out; he was smoking a cigar, and he gave me three and told me all about the robbery. I left him then, and in the evening I went to Spring-street and met Wheeler and a man named Moss. He (Moss) had a bundle under his arm. I followed them some distance, when Moss asked me where I was going to. I told him I was goir, with them, when Moss said, "If you -Aon'tgobeckruknockyou down." Iep ton with them, and in about half an hour Britton told me had a gold wa>tch, and that Moss had sold two coats and oher things for him. Wheeler told me that Moss had offered 3 tor the gold watch, but that Britton refused to The prisoner was remanded till Thursday next, uon the bar, when it is expected that additional evidence of a crimmatory nature against the parties will be brought WsEmmtsrTmrs-Two flashily-dressed women, who gave the names of Ehza Jones and Ann Shewsmith, were finally examined before Mr. BEADON, charged with robbing Miss Emma Dawling, of 22, Burton-street, Pimlico, of her purse, containing fis. 6d. The rosecutrix stated that on the evening of that day week e was in Pont-street, Belgrave-square, when tho prisoners came up to her and inquired their way to the Kensington-road. They affected not to understand her, when she pointed out the direction, as she thought, more plainly to them, and while doing so Shewsmith pushed against her. Immediately upon their departure she discovered that her pocket had been picked of her purse, which she had shortly before felt safe. ShQ gave an alarm, and the prisoners were followed and captured, but the purse was not Mr. BsAnOy inquired what was known of the prisoners. Segeant Loom, a detective officer of the B division, said tat Jones was a ticket.of-eave woman, who bad been sen- tncedto transportation for picking pockets. Shewsmith's husband, then a ticket-of-leave man, was sentenced to six year penal servttuhde foÂ°r anburlglary7^ w comithed inMay last, since which she had been iving with two other ticketof-leave men. The sergeant added that while the prisoners were being brought to the statiox a respectablelocking mar n inforzed the constable who had them in cuastdy that he saw one of them hand what he supposed to be the pur to a third person just before they were captured, but they were unable to discover the name or address of the witnes Mr. BERDox thought he might perhaps yet come forward. A solicitor who attended on behalf of the prisoners urged the rmagr te to deal with them summarily. Mr. O} objected, after what he had heard of them, and committed them for trial. 101. lOs. was received from the Drapers' Company for the poor-box. W OR xslp pm . ili,am Saville was chargedl with Assault. William Egerton, an appraiser in West-street, Bermondsay, atated,-I was instructed to serve a writ for 971. odd on the diefendant through the Queen's Bench, and on the evening of the 31st nlt, went to his house, irn Providence. row, Finsbury, where, after waiting for him three hours i the street, Isaw him go in,~ adshortly after followed to a room on the second floor, at the door of which I knocked and saw the defendant sitting with a child it his kee.

I hnve suffered much pain; I have loot the sight of my left eye from the blow I xpoke of; I also suffered much from where I was hammered and kicked. I held the writ itself in my hand, and it had blood on it. Cross-examined.-I knev the defendant before, and was a witnessagainst him. When I knocked at his room door a wroman opened it who knew me, and would not let me in. I ran romnd her, but did not push her down or strike her. I did not call the defendant a covard, and challenge him to fght me, nor had I been concealed in the honse for two hours. I have not been convicted of felony, but I have been in prison for 20 days for possessing a piece of wood. Mr. WVynne Thomas.-I am house surgeon of University Hospital, to which, on the 1st inst., the prosecutor came mwith his left eye contused and black, and complainine of pain. I did not then beleve his sight was in danger, and I gave him a lotion and medicine. Two days after he came again, saying he could scarcely see with that eye, and I again administered to him. Two more days elapsed before I saw him again, and he then said he could not see at all with that eye. I then found a new symptom had developed itself, and on examining it with a medical frend I discovered that the optic nerve had been injured. I believe that he cannot see at aU with that eye; in fact, that he has lost the sight Mr. HA3rsrxum-I shal send this case before a jury certainly, but will acceptbhail. The depositions were therefora taken, the defence reserved, and the defendant formally committed for trial at the hiddlesex Sessions, but in the interim admitted to THEA3ms-John Murphy, aged 22, described as a pewterer, and Georger Porter, 24, who called himself a brssfounder, were brought before ir. YABDnLEY charged with aling a cashbox containing a 501 and four 51 Bank of England notes, 28 sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and other The prisoners were remanded until Tuesday. SOU'TrWAR1x-Keith Chandler, a middle-aged man, late foreman to Messrs Silva and Philippe, wharfingers, Gunand-shot-wharf, Tooley-street, was charged with stealing a large quantity of alum. He was also charged with selling the same and not accounting for the money he received. Mr. Co%ma said it was a clear case of emubezzlement, therefore he should remand him for a week, but, at the solicitation of Mr. Solomon, he consented to accept good ball for his appearance. Just at the close of the Court Mr. CoMsE received a check forlO guineas from the Master, Warden, and Court of Asistants of the Drapers' Company for the poor-box. LAxBr.-Edwin Thompson, Mary Ann Sage, John Ellis, and John Hyde were again placed at the bar, before the ion. G. C. NoRToN, for further cxamination, on a charge of breaking into the warehouses of Mr. Rabbets, a boot and shoe manufacturer in the Walworth-road, and stealmig boots and shoes to the value of 1201. The prisoners Thompson, Sage, and Ellis have been in custody since a few days after the robberv, and on Saturday week Hyde and another pewson, named Watts, were placed at the bar for the first time, but were admitted to bail, to attend on that day week. This, however, they did not do; on the contrary, they absconded from their bail; but on Monday last Hyde was apprehended in the Kingsland-road Alter they had so absconded it appears that an offer of 1001. and the restoration of the stolen property had been made to Mr. Rabbets, but this he declined, feeling it to be his duty to go on with the prosecution. rSergeant Coppin, who has the case in hand, requested a further remand, ws ich was granted. Mr. Somon, who attended for the prisoner Hyde, applied that his client might be admitted to bail, observing that so satisfied were his former sureties of his intention to appear on that day week that they were willing to become his bail again. Mr. NoRTON peremptorily refused to accept any bail or any amount of surety for the prisoner, and said he hoped that if the former bail were in attendance they had brought with them the amount of bail they had forfeited by the prisoner's absconding and not appearing in discharge of his recognizances, for if they had not, and the amount was not paid on that day, he (Mr. Norton) should certainly make a return of the recognizances as forfeited on the following (this) day. One of the sureties begged hard for time, but was told it could not be granted to him, and that the recognizances should be returned on the following day. Cbarles Collins, a powerful navigator,was finaDly examined on a charge of committing a violent assault on the person of Thomas Mathews, and also on two police constables. From the evidence it appeared that on the evening of 'Boxing-day' the prisoner and the complainant were at the George IV. publichonse, on Gipsy-hill, Norwood, when the former, without the slightest provocation, snatched up a quart pot, and with the bottom edge gave the latter a desperate bfowv on the left temple, inflicting a deep and extensive wound, by which injry his life had been for several days in great danger. When taken into custody the prisoner alSO assaulted and kicked two constables in violent manner. The prosecutor, MTathews, being now out of danger, Mr. NORTON disposed of the case summarily. He said his reason for doing so and not sending him for trial was on account of his former good character, and his misfortane since his apprehension of havmg his cottage and furniture de6troyed by fire. For the assault on Mathews he convicted him in a penalty of 51, or two months' imprisonment, and for those on the policemen one month for each.

THE LAW OF NATURALIZATIOY. TO THE EDITOR OF THEE TIRES. Sir,-As the minister of a very large foreign congregation in London I am desirous of adding my testimony to the fact that the question latelr raised about naturalization has produced alarm and anxiety in the minds of many foreigners with whom in my offlcial capacity I come in daily contact. The circular of the Home-office of the 5th of November, 1856, took every one bv surprise. On receiving it some wrote immediately to the Government of their native country demanding the required certificate of denationalization, and now the Secretary of State, without any reference to his previous circulAr, informs them by a letter published in your paper of the 31st of December that " the effect of a certiicate of naturalization does not extend to investing the alhen to whom it is granted with the character of an English subject in other countries." What the meaning is of such plainly contradictory statements, or how they are to be reconciled to the protection promised in the passport to every naturalized British subject travelling in a foreign land, no one can understand. Is the Home-office aware that certificates of denationalization are never granted by foreign Governments to persons who have either politically or cniminally offended agant the laws of theboitically counry again ~ ~ ~ irown country, and that consequently there cannot on that ground be any difficulty orobjectiontogrant them, abroad as well as at home, that fnUl and effectual protction to which, by tihle ftt of naturalization, they are otherwise most justly entitled?~~~~~~~~~~ ual Fzom the moment a certificate of denationalization is granted a foreigner has no further claim whatever to the protection, the rights, and the privileges enjoyed by the citizens of his native country. Has he then to forward this certificate to the Home-office for registration, in order to secure the full benefits of naturalization, or is it to be inferred that men who for years-xnd many for by far the greater part of their lives-have been resident in and engaged in the trade and commerce of this country, whose conduct has been irresponsible, whose charity liberal, and who have cheerfully submitted alike with their English brethren to the burdens and the duties of a loyal Brtish subject,-that such men are to be branded and virtually tumed adrift as outlaws as soon as they have left the shores of England? I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant. LOUIS CAPPEL Aimzser or ist. LGiorge's Gcrman Lutheran Church, in Alie-street%Goodman's-fields. Dalston-rise, Jan. 9.

CASE OF TOOTHACrE IN TBr HORSE.-A rather unusual case occurred within the last week in the practioe of Mr. Ferguson, Her Majesty's veterinary surgeon in Ireland. A horse, belonging to a person named Walker, livine in Brunswsok-strcet, ha been condemned as glandered, and ordered to be destroyed, his owner having been prosecuted for allowing him on a public thoroughfare. The animal was wasted in condition, and had a profuse discharDe from one nostril, similar to that of glanders. On making inquiries relative to the history of the case, Mr. Ferguson ascertained that the animal occasionaUy could scarcely masticate his food. This induced him to examine the horseis mouth, with a view to ascertaining the state of his teeth. Seeing one of the upper back teeth (the last but one) discoloured, he determined on extracting it, fancying it possible that it was affected with caries, and that an abscess had formed at its root and bcrst into the anoe, thus giving rise to the fetid discharge fromn the nostrilof that side. On drawing the tooth, which was accotoe, by a leviathan instrument exactly resembling the k}y,.th ex. tractor for the human subject, Mr. Ferguao5'. `urmisee were found to be correct. There 'was not alone decided caries of the tooth, but also a large chronic abicess &t the extremity of its socket, the contents of which had forced a passage for themselves through the bones into the passage of the nose, profusely furnishing the nostril with a most offensive dischare, which had been mistaken for that of 4landers, and we nigh was the cause of sealiUng the animal's fate. Since the extraction of the tooth the discharge has ceased, and the horse rmsticates his food properly, and has evidently improved in health, strength, condition, and spirits, being now able to do ordinary work. Thus dental gurgery is occasionally as requisite for the horse as for his master.- Manclwster Ezdmincr. JAdvertisement.1-" Routledge's Shakeloare," Part IL, pnce Is.

THB LIFE AND) CORRESPONDENCE or &R, JOHN MALCOLM. G.C.B.* Mi. Kaye'& new wMoik has some imnportaat maeritr, WA one very grave fault, which will 1`ave a great tendency to prevent its merits from 1,eing 'properly apprecined, or, indeed, very geue,.ally (,nown at all. Ift merits are-first, that, the author has had a very goe<a.subject; for, of all the admirable seIFPnts of tie East India Company wlho have contributed their share towards upholding its authority or extending its doniniion, there have been 'few, if any, whose abilities have been more eminent, or -xkose services have been more useful, than those of 'Sir John Malcolmn; while the singular diversit% of his employments as Ambassador, Re3ident, G6-neral, Governor, and Historian, supply au u-anuu's'I variety of topics for a biographer. ^Secor.Aly, Mr. Kaye has had all the assistance tofwds the satisfictory execution of his task whsah the free communication by Sir J. Malcnrn's family of all the sources of iniformation ie their possession could afford him" Thirdly, ea is well acquainted with the scene of action, .xith the character of the n.atives, and consesjuently with the previous hi,tory of India; and, lastly, the work is distinguished by a very laudable spirit of impartiality. But the one great fault which will prevent the majority of even the reading part of the population from becoming acquainted with the merits which we have enumerated is that the book is nearly as long again as there was any occasion to make it. Peter Pindar relates that a Dutchman in his time was wont to extol the literary merits of his brother for having writteii a book "As big as all this cheese." And some writers of the present day, without considering that a book as big as a cheese necessarily runs a risk of being nearly as heavy, seem to consider bulk as the very first requisite, and construct all their works on the Amsterdam model. It is evident that from the very beginning Mr. Kaye was determined to make his book as big as possible; and, accordingly, the account of Malcolrm's early years, of his childhood and his youth, though affordinig no traits in which he differed from other boys, nothing characteristic or indicative of the fututre man, are chronicled with the greatest minuteness. We are told, with the most accurate circumstantiality, that he was a daring and, in the opinion of the Westerkirk schoolmaster a mischievous boy, which we could have guessed ourselves, as he was far too real a man in mature life to have been a Miss Molly in his jacket and trousers; and, remembering that Nelson played truant to shoot a bear, and that Master Bertram more than once frightened his Dominie out of his wits, we should be inclined to augur ill of the future prowess of any one who, as a boy, did not at times scare the gravity of a schoolmaster, he being likewise a Scotchman, out of its cahlness and propriety. An East India Director of that dav does not indeed seem to have been quite of our opinion, for he was so struck by the heroism of the undersized urchin, as exhibited in the announcemenit that " if he met Hyder Ali he would draw his sword and cut off his head," that he gave him the cadetship which was on the point of being refused to his want of inches. We ourselves have heard scores of similar speeches from gentlemen of even less ripe age girt with swords of various material without ever setting them down as conquerors in embryo, and if any Director of the year 1857 has cadetships to bestow on similarly easy terms we will undertake to furnish him with the names of as many authors of promises equally fierce, duly certified by aiLxious niammas and admiring nursemaids, as the hon. Company can possibly find room for. Pages after pages of the first chapters are filled with similar trifling-with letters of family gossip, long stories of how fond he was of his sisters, and how proud they were of him; how glad he was to go home on leave, and to dine out with every one who asked him while on leavehardly so remarkable a feature in a subaltern's chameter as to deserve especial mention. Nay, so eager was Mr. Kaye to sw, ell his book, that he treats us to a long paragraph to tell us that he does not know hoev he amused himself oni his voyage fronm India to England; he dares to say he played whist, and conjectures that ho might have shot an albatross, though, if this conjecture be true, he seems to have escaped the remorse which sat so heavily on the soul of that Ancient Mariner who met with similar success. WVe will beg to remind Mr. Kaye of the last sentence of one of the family letters saattered over the book in such profusion :-"Aman who sits down to write a letter about nothing must waste ink, pens, and paper, and the patience of his friends" (page 56). The friends, no doubt, would rather have letters of nonsense than none at all; but what excuse can thero be for inflicting such upon the indifferenit public, which, in exact proportion to its eagerness to be informed of all that is characteristic of a celebrated man, is justly intolerant of all attempts to divert its attention from those poinits to stories which might be told with equal truth and equal want of judgment of uine men out of ten placed in similar circumstances? We will now endeavour briefly to give an idea of the exploits and estimate of the character of Malcolm as recorded in the volumes before us. John Malcolm was the fourth son of the proprietor of a small farm in Eskdale, called Burnfoot; two of his elder brothers rose also to conciderable distinction-General Sir James Lalcolm and Admi ral Sir Ptlteney ?vlalcohl ; and-what is perhaps a singular instance of such prosperity in the case of brothers who have risen solely by their own meritthey were all three made Knights of the Bath in the same year. .J ohn was born the 2d of May, 17469, the day after the Dluke of Wellington, with whom he was subsequently united in important services, and in intimate friend;ship. When 12 years old a cadetship was procured for him, and at the end of 1782 he sailed for India. Lively manners and an unfailing cheerfuiness of disposition made him a general favourite; and the actuteness and resolution which he began to display at a very early period secured him the favourable notice and assistance of his superiors. He showed an early preference for the diplomatic line, and with this 'view applied himself to the study of the various languages of the country and of Persian, and made such progress that in 1792 he was appointed interpreter to the troops serving with the Nizam. His health, however, had suffered from the -climate, and be returned for a time on leave to England. On his return to India he was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Rope, and at the beginning of 17,9i he wvas again at Madras, having before his departure froni England received the appointment of secretary to Sir Alured Clarke, the Commander-in-Chiief of that Presidency, in whose suite he had sailed; and on the removal of Sir Alured to Bengal Malcolm received a renewal of his appointment from his successor, General Harris. Like most men who are conscious of superior abilities, Malcolm was ambitious; he was always actively on the lookout to promote his own interests, and in the beginning of 1798 chance -threw in his way an opportunity of making a valuab3e friend, of -which be availed himiAelf with great promptitule. Lord Mornington, or, to give hium the title to which he was speedily promoted, and by nhich he is best known, Lord W ellesley, by far the ablest man w ho had directed atse destinies of India since .arren Hastings, stopped a short time at Madras on his way to Calcutta to assume the governmnent of India. Mlalcolm presented hirm with somne papers which ihe hal drawn up on the native Sta"es of ldia; and 'the ability whicthey evinced proeured for him the appointment of assistant to the PRelIUent at Hyderabad, which at once placed himn in a prominent political situation. He was summoned to Calcutta, where a personal ;acquaintance improved tEe high opinion that Lord WVellesley had already conceived of him from his writings and froui his actionss; and when the Governor-General sailed to the southern coast to superintend the operations to be carried on against rippoo Saib Malcolm had 'high and hionourable employment, and sas mentioned with especial distinction in the Gteneral Orders issued on the fall of Seringapatam. As a reward he was made first secretary of the commission appointed to settle the .Mysore Government. Again Lord Welleslev was pleased with bis conduct, and the next year gave him the appointment,with which in many munds his name is especially identified, of Ambassador to Persia. The object of the embassy was to secure an ally who should in some degree relieve us from the apprehension of an invasion by Zemaun Shah, the ruler of Affglianistan, by threatening the Affghans themselves on the other side of their territory. The extension of our alliances on every side was a favourite part of Lord Wellesley's policy; and it w as one in w lich Mal- 'The Life and (oien ondemex of Sir John ;; G.C.B., by J. W. Kave, .Eq.; 2 vols. Svo. Sunith, Elder, Rnd Co., London. 1857. I colm, whose viem were always of a large and bold character, eaged-y agreed with him, so that he was delighted vith his mission, and rewolved to spare no toil and no expense to render it successful. The expetns, indeed, has been made the ground of a serious charge against him by the well-known historian of British India, M1r. Mill, who calls is lavish" another word for " criminal" (iii., 468), *nd, though he does not deny that the ambassador was successful in all his objects, thinks sorae of I them, such as the defensive and offensive treaty concluded by him, miscliievous, the commercial treaty unimportant, and the connexion with Persia one which could not possibly have been worth the cost of maintaining it. I No doubt, the expense was great; Persia was almost an unknown country to Englishmen; for no embassy had been sent thither from England since the time of Elizabeth; but Malcolm soon discovered that the two things most esteemed in it were forms i and presents. The P-ersian Secretary,* whose visit I to , sprobably better known to most of our readers than that of Malcolm's to Persia, though he does ample justice to the zeal with which the infidels provided for his comfort, and records with grateful astonishment the gorgeous entertainments provided for him at the caravanserais, the rapidity with which the postboys harnessed horses to his carriage, and the uiwearied attention with which the waiters answered the bells, which the whole suite were continually ringing; yet, amid all his i delight and surprise, foumd amari alipdtl in the unfailing " bill" which reg,ularly saluted the departing Mirza, and chronicled beds, breakfasts, and bell-ringing with painful minuteness. Wlhat a bill is in England a present was in Persia, and more too; eveu Elajji laba does not accuse our Regent of having sent in his bill; but the Shah, who i"gorgeously attired, and one blaze of jewelry, was seated upon his cushioned throne" at Teheran, had as voracious ai appetite for presents as the most needy of his officers, and was only to be propitiated by jewels, guns, watches, looking-glasses, toothpicks, umbrellas, and tubs of sugarcandy. These, however, were easily provided; the question of zlhe forms to be observed was a more knotty affair. Mr. Kaye, as we have already mentioned, evidently thinks some apology necessary for the resolute punctiliousness with which Mlalcolm insisted on the observance of some to which our English notions would certainly attach no particular importance; but, in fact, his conduct in this respect requires no apology at alL He, with plain practical sense, regarded the forms prescribed with reference to what casuists call, in respect to oaths, the autimuts imponentis, and insisted on their due observance towards himself, not because he valued them, but because not to have so insisted would have appeared to Persian eyes an admission of inferiority. Therefore it was tha' he declined sitting on a short-legged stool, and abstained from presenting himseif before the Majesty of Persia till the question of the precise moment at which a cup of coffee should be offered to him was settled to his most diulomatic satisfaction. But, in fact, the most complete possible justification of his conduct in these particulars is to be found in his entire success. The Persians themselves, the best judges of such matters, admired not only the liberality with which he had enrichedtheir covetousness, butthefirmness withwhich hehad repelledtheir attempts to inveigle him into any admission of inferiority. In spite of themselves, they admired his indifference to the splendour of their Monarch ; they quoted the jests with which he humbugged one Ministert with as much zest as the youngest of his suite; marvelled at the engine with which he electrified another, stared with all their eyes at his magic lantern, and never ceased to remember him with affection and respect. .Malcolm was appointed Resident of Mysore at the beginning of 1803,-a period which, above all others, required an able man in such a position, for Lord Wellesley desired to restore the Peishwah to his capital, from which he had recently been expelled; and a strong force was collected for that object on the Mysore frontier, under the command of a man as yet known chiefly as the brother of the Governor-General, and owing his appointment to a fraternal partiality which caused soaie envy and discontent, and which certainly had in at least one instance afforded grounds for cavil, but who in a few more yearsmade all Europe rejoice that his fortunate relationship to Lord WVellesley had brought him thus early into notice, and who filled the world with his fame as the most invincible of Generals, the most honest and patriotic of statesmen. When General AVellesley was compelled to proceed to hostilities Malcolm was absent at Poonah from ill health, and he did not rejoin his friend till the great victories of Wellesley and Lake had brought the refractory chieftains, Holkar and Scindiah, to suie for peace. The arrangement of that with Scindiah was committed wholly to Malcolm, whose conduct in the negotiation met at first with Lord Wellesley's cordlial approval; but when he proceeded afterwards to deterniine the limits of the possessions which the treaty assigned to Scindiah and the Company the Governor's approbation was at an end. There were two important fortresses, Gwalior and Gohud, which Scindiah was especially desirous to retain, and which Malcolm was willing to leave in his possession. General Welledley agreed with him, on the grounds both of justice and of policy, but Lord WVellesley claimed them for the Company, and expressed his disapprobation of Malcolm's proposals to cedle them in very severe language. The Minister to whom Scindiah had intrusted his interests was a crafty and experienced diplomaList, called WVattel Punt, but whom, from the immobility of hiis countenance, so suitable for the then favouiite gamie of brag, Malcolm had nicknamed ""Old Brac ;" and some idea may be formed of his capacity from the anecdote recorded by 'Mr. Kaye, that years afterwards, when the Duke of Wellington was employed in the negcotiations at Paris, consequent on the battle of Waterloo, and Malcolm asked bim his opinion of Talleyrand, he was told that that wariest and subtlest of European negotiators " was a good deal like ' Old Brag,' but not so clever." Lord Wellesley now fancied that " Old Brag" had coiipletely outwitted the English diplomatist, and animadverted upon his facility in a manner which brought out the weak points of 31alcolm's character. Mialcolm was not only a brave man, but he was eminently endowed with a. much rarer qculity-namely, the moral courage which dloes not shrink fromi assuming rssponsibility, of vhich he had given more than one conspicuous proof ; but his firmness entirely failed him when he had to encounter blame, even when nothing was or could be inmputed to him beyond an error in judgment, wlic vwas shared by tlhe GovernorGeneral's own brother. His re lies to the secretary who communicated to hi2n lord Wellesley's displeasure are weak and unmanly. He declares himself so prostrated both in mind and body as to be unable to reply to the letters which he had received; to be perfectly heartbroken; and when Lord Wellesley, apparently somewhat sarprised at the effect of his rebukes, writes him a long letter wvith a view to remove or mitigate it. MIalcolm " is filled with sentiments of the warmest gratitude and most devoted attachment; assures his Lordship that the whole tenour of his future conduct shall bo regulatei in the strictest con- Iormnty to his 4esire," and has no wish beyond that of " showing that he is not unvworthy of the favour and condescension with which he has been treated." Lord Wellesley returned to England, and was succeeded bv Lord Cornwallis, lvwe, dying shortly after his arrival in India, 1was succeeded by lord MLinto-a man of moderate ability, but of very friendly dispo[sition towards Malcolm, which he soon exhibited in I a singularly illjudged manner. Before he quitted IEngland he had proposed to send a fresh Em- bassy to Persia, and he had wished Malcolm to be the ambassador; but his name was not popular with either the Ministers or the Directors, who had not forgotten the coe.liness of his Iprevious mission; and it was deterrined by the Ministers in England to send Sir Harford Jones as an ambassador from the King to the Shali. Still Lord Minto resolved to send his envoy too, and flatI tered himself that he hadframed "'alcoIm's commis- sion in such a manner as not to clash withadiplomatic mission" if Sir R. Jones should have arrived before him. }3ow the two missions should not have elashed is to us quite inconceivable; but Malcolm's failure, for he did fail completely in his object, was not at this time owing to the embassy from England, for it had not yet arrived, but to the influence which in the interval that had elapsed since his last visit to Persia the French had established at Teheran; 6o that he -vas inot permitted to approach the Persian Court. At Madras, on his return, Malcolm found a very dangerous crisis had arisen, which, if not arrested in time, might have involved our whole Indian empire in ruin, for the Madras army was in a state approaching open mutiny. The mutineers were not the common soldiers, bat the officers, and the most culpabie of all were the Commander-in-Chief hinaself and the chief members of the staff. Their grievances were various, and some, no doubt, had a real foundation. The Commiander-inChief, General M'Dowall, was dissatisfied, because, in spite of prcoedent and custom, the Directors had not appointed hirm to a seat in the Council, and so violent was his conduct that he was removed from his command; but the example of one invested with such high authority had done incalculable mischief, and it was soon apparent that both at Hyderabad and at AMasulipatamn the regiments in the Company's service were ready to take up arms against the Governiment. It was believed that the Queen's Regiments would remain firm in their allegiance, but the prospect of an actual conllict that such a state of things afforded did not daunt the leaders of the disaffected party. Seditious toasts were openly given at the mess table; one regiment at Masulipatam arrested its colonel, and placed him in confinement. In his perplexity the acting Governor, Sir G. Barlow, applied to Malcolm, who, while he viewed with apprehension the lengths to wbhich the mutineers had allowed themselves to proceed, had, as he had previously shown, a strong feeling that the inferior position occupied by the Indian offlicers to that of the officers of the Queen's army was a grievance which cried aloud for redress. He consented, however, to go to Masulipatam, to endeavour to re-establish obedience and order; but it is impossible to deny that, as far as his own character was concerned, both he and Sir George acted with signal imprudence. It was notorious, from the discussions which had taken place between them, that they did not quite agree as to the reasonableness of the officers' complaints, or as to the way in which the discontented were to be dealt with. Mtalcolm himself had nearly been involved in a personal quarrel with some of Sir George's staff, through a dispute of how far conciliation or compulsion was the proper means to be employed to bring them back to their duty; yet (i., 472-497) he was sent to Alasulipatam "without any writtenainstructions," and "it was left to his discretion to adopt such measures as circumstances might render advisable." It certainly does seem that this, which is Sir George's own statement, contains a justification of Malcolm's conduct on every point, save that of judgment; but it did not save him from very severe reflections on other grounds afterwards. He was so highly esteemed, even by those who had no personal acquaintance with hin, that he was received by the mutineers and listened to with patience vwhere perhaps no other officer in the service could have obtained admission for a moment; but the measures of lenitv and conciliation vhich he proposed were scouted by the Government. Sir George affirmed that Malcolm knew when he proposed them that they were wholly at variance with his opinions, and a very high authority on Indian affairs, Colonel Close, who was also a friend of iMalcolm's, appears to have to a geat extent agreed with him. At last Sir George took the matter into his own hands, compelled all the officers to sign a declaration of loyalty under pain of dismissal from the service, and by his vigour and fiminess extinguished every remnant of disaffection. In the meantime Lord MAinto had resumed the idea of sending Malcolm to Persia. Sir Harford Jones had concluded a treaty with the Shah, in consequence of which the Persian alliance with France was dissolved, and the Shah was to receive a subsidy to enable him to defend himself against any host(lities to which he might be exposed from France and Russia. The object attained was, apparently, exactly that which Lord Minto himself would have desired, but he would have preferred owving it to an envoy of the Company. He saw in the conduct and success of Sir H. Jones nothing but an abasement of the "rank and estimation of the British Government in India" and though Sir Harford -was still at Teheran, he despatched Alalcolm to the same Court, ostensibly to manage matters connected with the execution of the treaty as far as relates to the Indian Governmnent, and likewise to watch the conduct and judge of the fidelity of the Persian Court, but, most of aU, to neutralize the influence of the Royal Ambassador. We cannot conceive a more unwise proceeding, or one more calculated to place Malcolm himself and the Company in a false light. No doubt, he was an abler man than Sir H. Jones, and more highly esteemed by the Persians; but he was in a position necessarily inferior to that of the King's ambassador; and it was not in the nature of things that Sir Harford should not be nettled at a mission so evidently designed to interfere with his own. Accordingly there were unseemly bickerings and mischievous disputes between the two envoys; and if they were not productive of the ill-effects that might reasonably have been anticipated from them their harmlessness was greatly owing to the good temper and address of Malcolm himself; who, however unwisely heq may have acted in accepting and probably urg,ing his appoiniment, certainly conducted himself in its discharge w;ith admirable discreEon. Sir Harford was determained to assert his superior rank, and sought to dictate to the Shah himself what honours were to be paid to the envoy of the Company. His notes to the Vizier were mnet by counter-notes from Malcolm, insisting on distinctions with which he could not have dispensed without degrading himself in Persian eyes, though he agreed to vield precedence to the King's ambassador. The Persiaun Mtinisters -were delighted at the strife, as they anticipated increased presents from both the rivals; but the Shah settled the matter himself, declaring that though " Mr. Jins was a good young man," MIalcolm was the man to whom he was accastomed and in whom he could confide; so, though Sir Harford had stood at the avudiences to which he had been admitted, MIalcolm sat, or rather squatted, in the Royal presence, til his foot went to sleep, and, though the courtiers were shocked at his talking more. and more loudly, than his Majesty, the breach of etiquette was unnoticed by the Sovereign himself, who made him a General in his service, and actually created a new order of knighthood-that of the Lion and the Sun-in order to confer an honour upon him which should be the more distinguished from his being the first recipient of it. This second visit to Persia gave him a worse opinion of the people than he had conceived before. He found that if " Cyrus, best of kings," had taught them in his time "To ride, to draw the bowv, and speak the trmth," Futteh Alh Shah was much less successful in enforcing a similar discipline in this last particular. On horsemanship they still prided themselves, and, when the purser of one of the ships that had brought the Ambassador and his suite adventured on a canter into the country, and displayed that knowledge of the art proverbially attributed to sailors, he was comforted the next morning by finding that the Persians friendly to the embassy had excused him to their countrymen, alleging that he was an excellent horseman, but that he was very drunk. Their equestrian skill, however, had not sown taem the propriety o u etr proverb, which warns us against looking a gift horse in the mouth. On the contrary, they insisted on knowing wbat the presentsbestowed onthemhad ost, and then undervalued them. Alalcolm became very indignant, told them that they were pedlars, and not prines; that he should treat them as such, and offered to buy back his gifts on condition that those which he hinself was to receive should be of a value nearly equal to the sum that he was to pay. They turned out not worth one-third of it; and after much wrangling he actually did redeem his presents to the Prince and his suite for 20,000 piasters; and, as he had made them give a bond for the value of those which were to be given to him, he threatened to compel them to redeem theirs in the same way, though, when he thought that he had humbled them sufficiently, he withdrew his menace out of respect to the Shah hinself, whom he believed to be ignorant of the conduct of his son and of his Ministers; and thus terminated the dispute with some of that proper dignity which at first, ka his desire to shame the Persians7 he bad seemed in no little danger of forgetting.

NEW BRIJNSWICK AND CANADAL Aspecial meeting of this compar y was held yesterday at the London Tavern to receive a report from the deputation ltely sent to New Brunswaick, and to consider the proprie'y of reducing Othe ongomisnal famojungtofeo i the chapitaro 500,001. to400 001 Sir11. tggerdg in the chair. Mr. BYRNE (the Secretary) read the report of the directors, whieb stated that the whole of the shares issued had been taken up with the exception of 250, and that the company had been registered under the Joint-Stock Companies Act, with limnited liability. The arrangement for the purchase of the interest of the St. Andrew's and Quebec B lway Company had been ratified and confirmed by both companies. Application would be made to the Legislature for a bill authorizing the arrangement, and for enabling the company to carry out the undertaking. The directors congratulated the shareholders that arrangements had been made by the deputation in New Brunswick for the completion of the first portion of the railway, 40 miles in length. The redaction of the nominal capital to 400,0001. was for the purpose of enablin them to comply with the rules or requirements of the Stock-Exchange. with a view to the shares being quoted in the authorized share list ; but it would not interfere with the extension of the capital when required, The deputation had suggested that the net produce of tho land should be divided pro ratd among the holders of land shares, instead of dividing the land in lots among those shareholders. Mr. MAUDSLAY suggested that the utmost information should be given to the shareholders, and that the reports should be printed and circulated among the shareholders. The secretary then read the report of the deputation, which stated that they arrived in Halifax on the 8th of October last, and they proceeded from the latter place to Windsor, 40 miles, and it was expected that the line thence to Digby, which latter place was opposite St. Andrew's, would soon be completed. They had settled matters wvith the St.Andrew'sand Quebec shareholders, and by an arrangement with the B shareholders, when carried out, 15,0001. would become available for the works, provided they took their portion of the new stock, otherwise the shares would be forfeited. With regard to the state of the line, they found that the first portion of it, extending five miles out of St. Andrew's, was in a very defective state, and would require 1,0001 per mile to be expended to place it in a proper conditon. The engineer recommended that the works should be let in contrasts of a mile or two in length, so as to suit the means of smal contractors, and in that way they expected to construct the railway at a cheap rate. Theyhad no doubt that the proposed capital would be suffllcent to complete the line from St. Andrewb to Wood. stock-92 miles. The deputation, Messrs. Bates and Byrne, were of opinion that a muLch larger traffic would be realized than was originally contemplated. With regard to the land granted to the conipany, and to be granted, they recommnended a similar plan to be followed to that adopted by the Canada Land Company, and that the 20,000( acres represented by land shares should be taken back by the company, and managed in such a way that the profits arising from the land should be divided rateably among the land shareholders, instead of dividing the land into separate lots, and thus forming separate interests. The lands to be granted to the company on the completion of the line were much better than those already granted them. They were of opinion that the undertaking might be made a lucrative nvestment. (Cheers.) On the motion of Mr. MALhDSLAY, seconded by Mr. RITCIE, the reports of the deputation and directors were adopted, and ordered to be prnted and circulated among the shareholders. Mr. BATES, one of the deputation, then explained at considerablelengththeposition and prospects of the undertaking. He believed the proposed arrangements with respect to tho land would give general satisfaction to the shareholdera, Considering the geographical position of their line, and the capabilities of the beautiful harbour of St. Andrew's, he thought it would become a first-rate concern. Formerly he was of opinion that the land constituted the chief value of the undertaking, but after visiting Newv Brunswiclk and the district through which the line was intended to pass he beheved the traffic would be of more importance. The line must be completed to Woodstock before it would be of much value; hut when completed to Trois Pistoles it would join the Grane Trunk of Canada Railway at that plaee. It was evidently the interest. of the Grand Trunk Company to co-operate with them in obtaining facilities for extending the line from Woodstock toTrois Pistoles. There would be a large traffic over theirlinez'oom LowerCanada to England. It was impossible for the river traffic from St. John's to compete with their line, as the navigation was closed for several monuts during the year. He -contended that the harbour of St. Andrew's was rnuesh rore aora7enient than either St. John's or Portland forpassengers andgoodsbetween England and Canada, being 300 miles nearer 4o Ee'gland than Portland, and nearer by 60 milee than -t.Jahu's, New Brunswick, Vessels landing cargowi z Aridrew's could always get a back cargo, which could not be obtained at Portland. he Woodstock district contained about 230,000 inhabitants. There would be a large amount of lumber traffic on the line, and they would also have anineral traffic. He believed the timber tra'fic alone would yield them a dividend. A branch of about five miles in length would bring them in connexion with a lake 25 miles in lengib, and they would have feeders from other lines, 'She grant of land to the company would, estend nve aniles on each side of the line of railway. &Me of the laud appeared to be of a very productivp character. The ect of a portion of the railwaT wuon)' not exceed 3,0001. a-*ile. The Government had tCioscribed 50,0001. towards the railway, and. had pai. nAy 32,0001. ; there remained to pay 18,O01 The company would have 40 miles of railway ready for traffic in MBy next, and about 20 miles more ready in the- following N'ovember; they would then have to make 32 miles to get to Woodstock. 'On the metion of the C.uRmANS, seconded by Mr. EDWARDS, * resolution ws passed authorizing the directors to reduce the nominal amount of the capital to 400,0004 It was stated that on opening the line to Woodstock the company would be entitled to a grant of 200,000 acres of land n a guarantee of 6 per cent. on 80,0001. On the motion of the CiAURemIS, seconded by Mr. FEArERSTOYPF, a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to divide the net Drofits arising from the land among the holders of land shiares, instead of allotting the land among them as originally proposed. Mr. BLX\ER explained that the calls must be paid up ar,d the railway completed before they would be entitled to the lInd. The grants rested 'wath the Government, and it was believed they would deal liberally with the company. The proceedings concluded weith votes oE thanks to the chairman for presiding, and to Mr. Bates and the deputation for their semvces.
THE FRAUDS ON THE CITY OF LONDON! UNION. Yesterdy an official inquiry into the circumstances connected with the recent frands on the City of London Union 'was held by the Government inspectors, Messrs. F rnall and Cane, at the chief office, 51, St. Mary-axe. The main points taken yesterday were of an important character, the evidence and the explanations received being from the clerk, Mr. Jobn William Plowsell, and MTr. James Gibbs, the auditor to the union, both of whom havo been suspended until the investigation is completed. There were present a very large number of the guardians, and Mr. Le Breton, solicitor, attended for MIr. RowsoUi. In both of the cases a large body of evidenco was heard, but the main points as to the defence are stated in the subjolned documents, and tho report which follows each of them. Ir. Rlowsell writes fronn 5, BSlliter-street, as "My Lords and Gentlemen,-I beg very respectfully to snbmit for your consideration the following ohEervations on the statements contained in the report of the committee appointed by the guardians to investigate the conduct and proceedings of the officers of the City of London Union, a copy of which accompaaied your letter of the 3d inst. *In this report three distinct charges are made against me, to each of which I wish at once and fully to reply. " L As to the charge that I was in full knowled-e on the 2-th of November, 1856, tbat John Paul had used for his own private advantage two checks drawn by the Board of Guardians, and that I concealed such knowledge from the guardians and the committee of investigation until Wed. nesday afternoon, the 17th of December, and until the said John Paul had been acsisted by this delay in avoiding justice,-I beg to refer you to the statements made by me to the committee of investigation, and contained in their report of the 19th of December, 1866. In addition to such statements I beg to say, that on my discovery of Paul's misappropnation of the two checks for 5974 7s. 4d., and 3gf.. 15s Gd., on the 27th of November, Paul implored me to save him from the ruin of disclosure, and solemnly assured me that this was his only irregularity. Bearing in mind Paul's previous character for honesty, that he was upwards of (0 years of age, a husband and a father, and know ing that up to this time no imputation had been made against him, and the respectability of his family and connexiuns, I yielded to his solicitations, and, in the thought that the union ought not on that account to suffer, I did forthwith sell my propty, and did pay the full amount of the two checks, 976 2s. lOd., to the parties for whom they were intended, relying only upon Paul's promise to return menthe money, and on his assurance that his friends would assist hini in so doing. It is true that I did not communicate my knowledge of Paul's misappropriation of these checks to the board of guardians and the committee of investigation until 'Wednesday, the 17th of December; but the report omits to state that, on the discovery by myself of Manini's frauds on the evening of Friday, the 12th of December, Iimmediately, on the same evening, informed the chairman of the board of guardians of such frauds, and on Satturday, the 13th, I consulted both him and several other guardians as to the course to be pursued. That on considering the nature and extent of these frauds of Manini, and the possibility which then for the first time occurred to my mind of Paul's conuexion with them, I did not think it right any longer to withhold the disclosure of Paul's misappropriation of the checks from the chairman of the board. and I came to town on purpose on Sunday, the 14th of December, and communicated the same to him. That on consulting with the chairman, he thought it advisable, as the amount of the cbecks had been paid, and the union was not, therefore, injured, that Paul's conduct should still for a moment remain undiselosed, in the hope that he might prove to be free from any connexion with Manini's frauds, and that he might be able to assist in the investigation himself. That determ ining therefore caref elly to watch Paul's conduct the further disclosure of his misappropriation of the two checks wws not made umtil Wednesday, the 17th of December, on the morning of which day I disclosed it to one of the members of the committee of investigation, and on the meeting of the committee on that same day I made the same communication to the committee in tho presence of Mr. Cane, one of your inspectors. Thsatit is quite untrue that Paul was assisted by this delay in avoiding justice, as he had no knowledge whatever of my intention to dise'ose his misappropriation of the checks. That he was in the house at the time, that he remained in the house until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and might then it the committee had pleased have been given in charge, and on the day the committee made their report he was in the hands of justice. " 2. As to the charge that I caused to be prepared on Tuesday, the 16th of December, another cashbook for that which was previously put be.ore the board, I beg to say in answer, that the book so called the ' cashbook' was not in truth a cashbook at all in the proper sense of the term, b'ut was, in fact, merely a subsidiary book, purporting to be a copy of the banker's passbook ; and such hook had only been in use about two years, and was never referred to or asked for posting, or in any way in conne;ion with the accounts of the union i the cash account being kept under the head of 'Treasurers Accoumit,' in the union ledger, as directed by the order of accounts issued by your board, no cashbook being required to be kept under that order. That several weeks before the discovery of Paul's misap. propriation of the chocks I found that Paul had not kept this book correotly; thereupon I directed him immediately to correct it, or, if that could not be done in the old book, to re-enter the whole in a new book. That it hanpened that such new book was not completed until Tuesday, the 16th of December, on which day it was produced by Paul to the board of guardians, and the old book was improperly kept back by him. That such old book was not kept back by my direction or with mry cogni7vance; but, on the contrary, on the suggestion of Paul that the old book might be destroyed, I directed that on no account should it be destroyed, but should be preserved and produced. That on Paul's unexpected hesitation to produce the old book, I left the 'ooardroom myself, and immediately returned with the book,which I took from Paul's hands, and laid it upon the table of the board. That the book since that day has been in the hands of the committee of investigation, and was in their possession when they made their report. That in giving such directions respecting this bcok I declare that I had no idea of any intended fraud, but looked upon the errz,rs in the book simply as a piece of negligence on Paul's part. As to the charge that 'For many years I have neglected the most important portion of the duties of my office, and thereby greatly facilitated the frauds of Paul and MRauini,'-In answer to this general charge, I appeal with unhesitating confidence to my general conduct during my 20 years' service; to one unbroken course of approbation by, and the apparent personal friendship of, the numerous mnembers of the board, past and Present; and to the votes Grecorded in the mmnutes of the Board of "Having thus endeavoured to meet the charges made against meinthereport, Itakethe opportunity of saying also that complaints of over-confidence or absence of suspicion attach to thewholeboardof guardians, the anditors,my feUow clerks, and others equally with myself. I trusted, and they trusted, John Paul, who had been a confidential clerk of the union, of their own appointment, for nearly 20 yeArs and he has entirely deceived us all. It is manifest that the heavy duties smposed upon the clerk of so extensive a union as that of the City of London, consisting of 98 parishes, each requiring a separate account, made it necessary to resort to a division of labour. The departments of the accounts was entrusted by the guardians to an assistant clerk of their own appointment, from whom they required security for the due discharge of his office, whose duty it was to keep the ledger and other books of account and to submit them to the auditor for his examination. These accounts hadbeen certifed by that officer to be correct for a long term of years; no doubt of the efficiency of the auditor had ever existed, and I venture to think there are few who would not have reposed foll confidence, as I did, in common with others, in the accuracy of aecounts which had been subjected, as I believed, to the test of periodical investigation by a competent officer. I would submit that when charges are brought against a public officer, and are still under imvestigation, they should be expressed in a spirit of candour and moderation, and that there ought to be no suppression of any important fact. " Whether or not the charges against me as stated meet these requirements I leave to the impartial judgment of your hon. board. I have been content for a time to bear the weight of obloquy which has been cast upon me by the publication in the dailv papers of the Report of the Committee of Guardians; and, knowing that the inquiry into the case was in your hands, refrained from appealing to Ihe public press to make known my reply to the charges thus brought against me. I venture to hope that when all the circumstances under which these frauds have been committed are taken into consideration your hon. board will not fail to see that the long services of an officer, trusted as the assistant-clerk had been, the accuracy of his accounts, attested during a series of mnanyyears bythe auditor, andthe artful ingenuity by which Paul contrived to conceal his frauds from every one-all tended to create a fatal confidence. Although happily exempted from any accusation of fraudulent complicity in these fraudulent transactions, I cannot but say how deeply I regret that leases so h,esv should have been mncued. "Trusting that you wnll come to no decision upon my ease without an impartial consideration of all the circum. stances with which it is surrounded, "I have the haxour to be, my Lords and gentlemen, "Your most obedient servant, JOEHN WM. ROWSELL. "To the Poor IA%v.oara."1 3fr. Rowsell, on beinexaninned as a witness, stated, that he liad known Paul fÂ£ xe laet 20 years, and from the high character he had borne bA tion and that of the gn, !h m pr& Rowsell's) estimai capable of deliberat. d n, he din not believe him to be of the fecling wvb Aq og a dishonest ct.

He wasclosely questioned as to his connexion. with Paul to whom he admitted having lent a considerable. sum out of his own property, realized from tho sale of oertain estates for the purpose of saving him (Paul) from ruin. With respect to a note said to have been sent to Paul by r. Thornton, the chairman of the union, to intimate to him a probability that the board offlces wonld. be taken possession of by the Poor Lawr authorities in consequence of certain alleged deflcations, Mr lowsell admitted having seen a copy of such a docuent - the original, lhe believed, was now in the hands of the guardians Thisletterwas asfoUows:- "Monday rmorning. Erlend Paul,-I shall not wonder at the Poor Lavr odr usendng down to take possession of the office books " If you have any that are not connected with the union, yo, mayours trdly a ls -'TEtHI 9THORNTOIN.' ! The case of Mr. Gibbs was next gone into, and his written statement, the material portions of which are diven below, was first read. It was dated 9, Inner Temple-lane, Temple, January 5,1857, addressed to the Poor Law Commiseioners, andintended as an answer, so far as he is concernod, to the statements contaned in the report of the committee of investilation. After some preliminary observations hesays :-" w ould remind the board that the City of London Union contains 95 parishes, that the accounts thereof are very cumbermome, and that I have always experienced considerable difficulty in getting the union accounts thereof completed for the purposes of audit, great delay in this respect ever occurring; and likewise that the union accounts have niot been presnted to me since those for the half-year ended on Lady-day, 1S56. The accounts of the overseers only for the nexthalf-year-ez. to Michaelmas, 1856, have~ 1 had before me; and I feel that I ought not to omit mention of the fact that the board of guardians have always been represeuted at my several audits by their confidential officers Messrs. Paul and Manini, who thereby have been enabled the better to carry out their frauds." He reminds the board that his audit was twofold, embracing the accounts of the overseers and those of the board of guardians-i. c., tho union accounts; and then relates in much detail his mode of auditing them botl. " Under these circumstances," he continues, " the board will see that f was placed in a position of peculiar difficulty as regards Manini's collections and alleged payments. On the one hand the guardians, who were deceived every week, prcsent me at the audit with their ' statement,' as admitting the receipts by the treasurer, while, on the other hand, the overseers, who were deceived as to the fact of Manini's. alleged payments, present me half-yearly with their signed and verified accounts, clauning c-edit for the same as true payments, and I myself was deceived, notvwhstandin ad imagtned I had a sufficient test of the accuracy ot overseers' accounts. The colludon however, of the assistant clerk wvith the ttnion coUector onabled them to avoid thc discovery of their frauds, by either the board of guardians, the overseers, or myself, till the 12'h of December last." He adds:-"As I am ignorantof the facts discovered against the assistant-clerk, save as to his cooking certain books and his deahng with the guardians' checks during the past nine months, i.C, subsequent to my last audit account to Ladyday, 1856, to which date alone have I seen the union account s, I do not see that at present at least I am called upon for any observation on that part of the case " There are three great points to whichthe attention of the Poor-Law auditor has to be directed,-viz., the Accuracy of the calcilations and apportionments of charge, the legality o. the itemns, and the discovery of fraud. It is clear that the aistant-clerk and union collector, after having snecessfully baffled the attention (in fact, the personal interest) of the overseers of the nine parishes whose rates were collected by N,anini, and the practised skill of a board of guardiats like that of the City of London Union, also, un,il the 12th of December last, succeeded in deceiving me, vho neccessarily to some ex tent, at least, must depend upon the accoants which have been previously examined and certified as correct by the board of guardians and their officers All I will venture here to add is that I never spared time nor labour in the discharge of my extensive and responsible duties, and I would remind the board that no one single Appeal against my decisions in any of the unions in my districts has ever been successful, and that I believe it will be found that the calculations and apportionments have been correctly made, so far as the arithmetical question is concerned. I sited bardly observe, in conclesion, how deeply I regret on every ground that such a fraud should have been perpetrated. "I at, &c., " JOSEPH GIBBS." The principal features in tho exanmination of Mr. Gibbs consisted, of course, in the manner of his having supervised the financial a&esirs of the union in his capacity as auditor. Several pointed questions were put to him by Mr. Singer, Mr. Finlay, and other guardians, for the purpose of showing any cosnexion which might have existed between Paul and Manini the collector, through any negligence or inattention on the part of such an important officer; and, in answer to Mr. Heath, lr. Gibbs admitted having irregularly made up the Last year's accounts, the result of which, MIr. Heath was prepared to say, left to the credit of the union outstanding debts to the amount of between 15,0001. and 1G,0001. The whole of the statements having been gone through, and 3Mr. Gibbs heard in explanation, and his answers recorded isz cxknso by the inspector, Mr. Cane, the latter gentleman stated that, so far as the instructions of his colleague and himself went, at present they had come to the end of this portion of the inquiry. The whole of the evidence would be reported by Mr. Farnall and himself to the Poor Law Commissioners, who wrould report their opinions upon it to the board of guardians. It was, however, to be understood that it by no meansfollowed that the inquiry was complete, or that it might not be speedily resumed. So far, however, they had finished the preliminary part of it. Upon the motion of Mr. Finlay, seconded by hr. Causton, thanks were voted to the two inspectors, and the proceedings termiuated.
LOOK1 TO THE HALL-MA RKI TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Two years ago there was an alteration made in the quality of gold marked in Goldsmith's-haUl, it being represented to the President of tho Board of Trade that it would be advantageous alike to the manufacturer and the public; the consequence was the standards were altered, and, instead of there being only two different standards, there are now five -viz., 22. 18, 15, 12, and 9 carats. Now, Sir, I will show you how the public are benefitted: -A lady or gentlemoan walks into a shop, and asks to be shown a gold watch; the pattern pleases, also the price, and conversation something liko this ensues. " I hope this is a good watch, and I hope the cases have been marked at the London Goldsmiths-hall ?" to which questions the seller can answer in the affimative, " I assure you the watch is a ood timekeeper, and the cases bear the stamps of the Mondonbhall." He is right, the cases were marked at the Londonhall; but, bere is the swindle :-the chances are-as in the case of a friend of mine, who caUed on me to show me a gold watch he bad purobased-the cases, instead of bearing the mark of "1 8 carat," the gold of which would be worth 67s. per oz., were marked " 12 carat," consequently the gold was worth only 45s. per oz.; so that he has been legally robbed of the difference being 33s., the cases weighing loz. 10dwt. Now that I have shown what is done, I wish to tell the public how to guardagainstthis legal swindle. The remedy is simple and in their own hands. When they are purchasing a gold watch se that the cases are marked 18 carat ;" if they are not so marked do not make the | purchase. I am, Sir, yourobedient servant. ONE OF THE TRADE.
THE LATE MURDER AT MERTHm R.-Tle iiiquest on the body of G. Lewis, who was found murdered under the circumstances deteiled in TMU 2imes of Thursday, ws resumed on that day at Merthyr, before Mr. G. Overton, the district coroner. Mr. Dyke, surgeon, deposed to having made a post mortent examination of the body of the deceased. Death had undoubtedly been caused by an extensive fracture of the skull, and consequent injury of the brain. In his opinion, the fracture had not been produced by a blow from any instrument, but had been occasioned by the deceased having been thrown with great violence down stairs. He did not think that the injuries could have been the result of accident. When he was first called in to see the deceased she must hr.ve been dead for some time, heshould say for at least gix: hours. M1r. Superintendent Wrenn stated that he had traced spots of blood from one underground kitchen to the otler; that there were marks of a trag avingtaken place on the stairs, as the plaisterofhad beentruglen away from the walls. Among some blood he found the cap xnd side-comb belonging to the deceased. The superintenent further stated that, having been detained by Isis duties at the Glamnorgaushsiro quarter sessions, he bad been) unable to devote to the case that tinme and attention which its importance demanded, and he asked to have an opportunity affurdedhimofgettingfurther eviden The oroer cnsieredtheAPPlication a reasonable one, and adjourned the inquiry till1 Friday (yesterday) afternoon. T1wo IEv BURIED AIVE.-An inquest was held a day or two ago at Chalfont St. Peter, Bucks, 4l*'e Mr. F.

The deceased had been employed to sink a shaft for chalk on Friday week, and whUle so engaged the pit closed in upon them. The bodies were not recovered until the followin Sunday.
