THE ADDRESS.
Sir.T.RAMSDENhang brought up the report upon theAddressagreed to by the House inreplyto Her Ma. jes's Message,
Mr. HADFIELD took the opportunity of objecting to the presentform of communication from tho Throne to the Hose. In the Royal Message recently addressed to Parliament there was not a sin"le piece of information with which the public were not previously acquainted, neither was there the slighte3t indication of the intentions of the Government in respect to matters which were deeply agitating the public mind. His chief objection, however, was that in the last, as in most other communications of that description, thero was not the slihtest expression of sympath& towards our colonial fellow-subjects. The apathy of the Government in respect of our immense colonial possessions wsz astonishing. especially when It was remembered that for the supply of cotton-a matter of vital fnterest to this country-we were almost entirely dependent upon the United States, while in India we possessed territorieg where that article could be most extensively growvn if the Government would only devote some little attention to the subject. Last year the consumption of cotton in this country was at the rate of 43,000 bales per week, and every year showed an increased demand. The failure of the crop in the United States would be attended with consequences fearful to contemplate, and, besides, the supply might be stopped from other causes. The American manufacturers, who rivalled the manufacturers of this country, would be the first to be sup ped; and should the slave trade be determined there would be less certainty in the quantity of cotton produced, Was it doing justice to India to give the whole advantage of our purchases to the Americans, or was the Government of India showing Its wisdom in neglectin this sourcej when It had been obliged to enforce the collection of revenue even by torture ? He did not ask the Government to grow cotton or silk. He only made this reasonable reqest, that they should open a field in which the capital and skll of English manuacturers might be advantageously employed. (Hear, hear.)
AdmiralWALCOTT didnot wish either to raise ojections to the Address or to comment on the wars with Persia and China. With regard to China, he understood the noble lord at the head of the Government to have said, that he would lay the papers before the House at the earliest possible moment, but that it would be unwise to do so immediately, as negotiations were pending between the Chinese Envoy and our Minister at Pa Looldng simply to his profession, he had to perform the grate{fl duity of praising the caution, celerity, and efficiency displayed by the Government of Bombay in preparing the expedition to the Persan Gulf, and of commending the officers in command of the land and sea forces employed In that service. (Heart hear,) As far as he was informed, greater gallantry or abiity bad never been shown in the performance of similar duties. (Cheers.) He regretted hat the flag of the Admiral ws not hoisted on board one of Her Majesty's ships, and he noticed, as a proof of many officers deserving the highest consideration being prematurely removed from the active list, that Admiral Leeke's name appeared on the reserved list. (Hear.) With regard to China, he was sorry that the retribution inflicted ws beyond the a%gression received, buc he was perfectly satisfied Admiral Seymour had used all the forbear. ance that was consistent with the instructions nuder which he acted. (Hear.) In his opinion it was a pity so much gallantry should have been displayed in conflict with so mean a foe, and that the sledge-hammer to which we had been compelled to resort should have been used in crushing flie (Hear, hear.)
Sir J. FITZGFRALD hoped the Board of Control would seriously consider the subject to which the hon. member for Sheffield had referred, and give such directions as would lead to the improvement of roads in the Presidency of
Mr. V. S3ITH sid, the quedion raised by the hon. member for Sheffield was of such importance both to this countrT and to India, that he should be extremely sorry to showi mdifference even in appearance, but he did not know how he could add anything to what he said Last night. He did not exactly see whhat it was his hon. friend wished to have done. If his hon. friend would make a specific motion he should be ready to meet it. The acousation was general, that the Government of India had completely neglected the growth of cotton. That statement was exaggerated. A select committee had reported favourably of the efforts of the Government to introduce the cultivation of cotton into India, and sincethat time those efforts had not been relaxed. He supuosed the hon. member, as a freetrader, would not have the cultivation of cotton made compulsory, and in the way of encouragement nothing had been left undone. Experments ae to the growth of American cotton in Indiaha generaZly resulted in failure, and it was his belief that the indigenous plant ought to be cultivated in preference. It was true there was a deficiency of roads, but the Government had done all they could to promote railways and branch roads in order to facilitate the transmission of produce to the coast. The difficultz of the soil and the mag. nitude of the exese ad, however prevented the progress of railss in India bein as rapid as was
ishe. Thehon. member had openup the whole question of land tenure in India. The subject was too lrge to discuss then, but he admitted it was worhy of considers. tion whether, to induce the employment of capital, it miDht not be well to make the charges on hnd fixed inse f variable. (Hear.) He was anxious to see capital embarked in the development of the resources of India, and he should be glad to hear of companies being formed for t.he purpose. The complaints by the missonaries of the judicial and police systems were under investigation ey the Government, and, in his opinion, that was a better mode of inquiry than by a commission, which might excite vag,ue hopes and embarrass the Governmen t.
MEr. KINNAIRD regretted that the Government had dlecided not to grant a commission of inquiry, andhooed theyvwonid recondiderthie matterwhenan important petition from persons, in9nuential and well-affected towards the Company, .wrhich was now on its way to was laid en te table of the house.
The reportwas then Agreed to, and the Address was ordered to be presented.
On the motion of Colonel Fsxscir the standing committee to control the arrangements of the kdtchen and refreshment rooms was appointed.
Mr. CRAUFURD moved for leave to bring in a bil to render judgOments or decreets obtained in certain courts In England, Scotand and Ireland respectively effectual in any other part of the united kingdom.
Colonel ERENCH asked wvhether this was the same biUl whicohhad been successfully resisted for the last four or five
Mr. CRAUFURD said, it was the same biL but it Wd been approved by the Conference on Commercial lAw.
The motion was ageed to, and the bill was ordered for a second reading oil w ednesday next.
The House adjourned at half-past 1 o'clock,

TEHZ Sw's HIOSPITAL SOCIETY.-The annal rmeeting of this society ws held yesterday at tho office 86, King william-street7 Vice-Admliral Sir Hfenry iope0 K.C.B., in the chair. The report stated that the society bad been instruental in saving life and restoring health to muany thousand seamen. A tabular statement, accompanying the report, showed that the number of men admitted into the Floating Hospital, since its establishment inMarch, 1821, to the 31st of January, 1857, had been 77,456 They had belonged to 25 different nations:-3,348 had been employed in Her Majesty's navy; 1,793 in the East India Company's service and 72,308 in merchant vessels of different nations. 43,&)0 besides had beenrelieved as out-patients. The number of patients admitted during thepast year had been 1,851, and the number supplied with medical and s cal attendance, medicine and medical stores, 1,65S-main a total of 3,509. In June last the Lords of the Admiralty had made a gift to the society of Her Majesty's ship Caledonia, a larger and more commodious vessel than that now in use, and of which the society bad been possessed for upwards of 25 years, and it was the intention of the committee to alter the name from Caledonia to that under which the Hospital had been so long known-the Dreadnought. The expenso of fitting up this ship (except removing some iron and timber, and cutting the orlop deck, had dovolved on the society, and the cost had already been 11,0001. Little remainedto bo done beyond the completion of the screen for that portion of the deck set apart for the performance of divine worahip; and, as the ship was now brought to her moorinig, Blj_ would, in the course of a 'ew days, supersede the present Dreadnonght. Commander John Sandois, RN., 1fi4 retired from the office of superintendent of the hospital, which he had held for upwards of 19 years, ana was allowed by the society a superAnnuation pension of 125I a-year; His post was now filled by Commander J.

The Public Health.
THE PUBLIC 1EALTH.
(From tbe Registrar-General's Weekly Return.)
The deaths registered in tho week that ended on Saturday. were 1,209, which is nearly thesame as the number retarnedi in the previous week. In the 10 years 1847.56 the average number of deaths in the weeks eorresponding wi tsweek was 1,167; and if this is raised for the parpose of comparison proportionaly to increase of population, it wijl become 1,284 The rate of mortality that now rules is not high, as compared with that of previous season4 although it has lately shown that tendency to increase which is to be expected at a period of the year usually the most fatal to human life.
The deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory organs were last week 288, being rather less than a fourth part of the total number returned. The average rate of mortality from this class of diseases at this season would have pro duced nearly the same number. The number referred to bronehitis in the present retarn is 166, which exceeds the average, and is double the number referred to pneumonia. Seventy-three of the deaths caused by bronchitis occurred to persons who were 60 years old or more, while 70 of the 84 from pumonia occurred to children. Phthisis, which is not included in the above class, was fatal to 146 persons (being almost the same as the corrected average); and of these 107 died in that period of life which extends from 20 to 60 years. Hooping-cough is at preset decidedly the most fal disease included in the zymotic class; 57 chbldren died of it, while 29 died of gcwrlatina, and 28 persons at yarious ages of typhus and common fever. Two children of a dock labourer died of " febris " at 4, Crown-court, WhitechapeL Three childrendiedof measles in the workhouse St. Geor- -in-theEast. A mother, and her son aged 4 years, died 's*s&itery at Hammersmith. The death of a seaman who had been expeled from his ship when in a state of illness was accelerated by exposure to cold; and that of a yotng womau by want of food.
Of 60 persons who had attained the age of 80 years or more seven were nonagenarians, The oldest was the -widow of a tailor, who died at 1, Boddy's-bridge, St. Saviour's, at the very advanced ago of 97 years.
Iast week the births of 879 boys and 883 girls, in aU. 1,762 children, were registered in London. In the ten cor. responding weeks 184746 the average number was 1,572.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29602 inches. The bighest reading occurred on Thursday, and was 29 77 inches. The mean temperature of the week was 31-2 deg., which in 7 deg. below that of the previous week, and lower by 6-8 deg. than the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean temperature was
below the average on every day of the week, and on Thurg.. day, when it was 26-2 deg., the amount of depression below the average was nearly 12 deg. The highest temperature in the week was 39 deg (on Sunday, the 25th), and the lowest was 20 deg. (on Friay). The rangeof the week was consequently 19deg. The lowest on grass onFriday was 8-9 deg. The mean dew-point temperatare was 28-1 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 31 deg. The wind blew generally from the north-north-east till Thursday afternoon, when it began to blow from the south-west. The amount of rain. (or melted snow) was 0A44 inches, of which 0-25 inches fell on Saturday. Snow or rainfell on every day except Thursday and Friday.

Legal Accidents.
LEGAZ ACCIDENTS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-There appe3rs in 17Tc Times of this morning a further letter from Mr. John Brady, in which (while admitting the inaccuracy of his former statementS) he reiterates tte charges of "gross misconduct" and " scandalous Impro. priety" on the part of the railway officials in arresting Temple, and in support of these charges he quotes what pro. fesses to be the evidence at the trial of the prosecutor (lfr Gorst).
As this matter, to which so much attention has been called by your insertion in T7 Times of six letters from lMr. Brady, involves not only the character of individuals but the conduct of a public company and the due adminis. tration of justice, I have applied for and obtained a copy of the notes taken by Lord Wensleydale, the judge who tried the case.
These notes, and the deposition of the prosecutor Mr. Gorst, who with other witnesses appeared before the committing magistrate on the arrest of Temple, are as follows:-
" Dsposrriox or Hu. GoRsT.
This deponent John Gorst, on his oath, sayeth as folows:-I left Preston for London on Thursday evening, the 3d of February inst., by the expres train. At Stafford the prisoner John Temple got into the carriage where I was. No one else was in the carrifge. The prisoner told me he was going, by order of the stationmaster at Stafford, to Rugby, to look after some luggage he had lost the day before at Rugby. I had a carpetbag in the carriaze with mo on the seat opposite to where the prisoner sat. The bag contained one pair of trousers, five shirts, a nightshirt, seven silk handkerchiefs, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of boots, and sundry other articles; and a siUk purse, containing five notes of the Bank of England. value 51. each, and ten pieces of the current gold coin of the realm called sovereigns. The train arrived at Rugby about 9 o'clock at night, no other person having got into the carriage except myself and the prisoner; the moment the tram stopped at the Rugby station the prisoner got from his oeat, put the glass down, opened the door and got out, but he remained close by the carriage. I got out and went three or four yards from the ca e, and observed the prisoner climb over the couplings of the car-
othe other'8ide. I then got into the carriage aain, an found my carpetbag, with its contents, gone. When the prisoner got out of the carriae ho had nothing with him, but he could reach the bag from the window on the off side, the carpetbag being on the seat next to the windowv. When I got out of the carriage the carpetbag wag safo on the seat. I immediately gave information of my lose. About 10 minutes after I saw my bag in the possession of William Box, foreman porter. My name is engraved on a brass plato on the bag. Box avme up the bag the same night. "JOHN GORST.

Prisoner was on my left. Prisoner got in at Stafford. He had no luggae; I took notice of that. In journey from Stafford he said he was going to Rugby by order of stationmaster at Stafford to look for some luggage which he had left at the station at Rugby, or which had been left. When I got to Rugh I tot out. The moment the train arrived prisoner opened the window on my side and got out. I then got out, and in perhaps a ninuto or two before I got out I saw prisoner standing three yards off the carriage. I saw him make a pring and get over the coupling iron of the carrage behind me. I then went into the building soon bEter I saw him going over the conpling irons. when I got back I missed my bag. I sked for the superitendent. Carriage was searched in mypresence.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
&YO-Z.ZY-MABKBTandyITBINTLLIGENCE
Wednesday Evening.
The English funds have been fairly maintained today, but au improvement of an eighth which took place during the morning was not supported. Conzols for money were firat quoted 93bto ., and reuMrned to that price after having been at 93} to 1. The arrangements for the settlement of the account now in progress seem to indicate a xather faull aupply of stock, and this was tne cause of the re 41ctiOn in the afternoon. The rate for advances oa C:overnment securities continued to range between
cent. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; ituced, 93+ to {; New Three per Cents., 93S to*; India Stock? 218 to 220; Exchequerbonds, 98j to i; India-bonds, 2s. discount to ls. premium; and Exchequerbills, par to 2s. preisure.
This has been the 4th of the mQnth, and the number of billis falling due was very large. They have been well met, and the discount-market is easier. The applications at the Bank were stiLl numerous.
The foreign stock-market was steady to-day, but the operations were not important. At the close there was a tendency in some cases to Improvement. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 93;k; for the account, 931 and 94. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions took place for money at 1011, and for the account at 101. Venezuela in supported at 37Z for the Active, and 15 for the Deferred. The general operations comprised -Mexican, for the account, 21- and j ; Portuguese I'hree per Cents., 43 ; Russian Five per Cents., 109; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96i and 97; Spanisl%ew Deferred, 234 and;~. ; Spanish Certificates,76n4*ad i; Swedish, S62; Dutch Two-and-aUIalf per Cents., 65k; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98k.
The corn-market was dull this morning at former prices.
The final quotations of the French Three Per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. e5c. for money and 68f. loc. for the end of the month, showing in the former case an improvement of an ei,,hth per cent. The supply of money in the market has proved better than was anticipated, and the monthly liquidation has passed off moderately welL The rumour of an intention on the part of the Government to impose a tax upon shares is still eirulated, but, perhaps, only by interested speculators. On the Vienna Exchange there, has been a further increase of firmness.
Whether the Bank will adopt any new measures of restriction this week is a question that will depend upon the figures of the return to be published on Friday next. As the last return was not unfavourable, and the late Mexican arrival has fur-
ished a supply of silver that will go far to provide for the next remittance to India, an opinion is entertained by many that, notwithstanding the continuous nature thus far of the drain to the continent, the necessity for any immediate change may have been removed, and that with the prospect of some large receipts from Australia and a further eonsiderable arrival of silver by the West India packet due on the 17th, it is even probable that a return to higher rates may be altogether averted. This possibility is strengthened by the fact that the existing state of the market is found to exercise considerable infiuenoe in causing an economy of the coin circulation throughout the kingdom, as well as by the anticipation of occasional remittances of sovereigns from Constantinople, and the tendency observable during the last fortnight to a reduction in the rates of some of the continental banks. There is likewise reason to infer that the natural course of trade must soon operate to produce an easier state. It has for a considerable time been a cause of perplexity that the existing pressure should have been so long maintained. If the trade of the country, it might be asked is more active and our profits larger than ever, how is it that these profits do not plae us in a position of greater monetary ease? A high rate of interest may prevail all over the world as a consequence of the abundant openings for the employment of capital, but, however high the general rate may be, England, if she is drawing profits from other countries, should, at least, be relatively better supplied than any of them. A contrary result might be explained by commitments to foreign loans or public works, but it is certain that, even'allowing for the Indian outlay, we have not gone in these matters to any undue length. Assuming the correctness of these views, the only solution that presents itself is that the demand must have been caused by private operations, partly consisting of an extension of enterprise by individual firms who have furnished their correspondents with capital for employment abroad, especially in India and Chinan , and partly of continental investments and advances induced by the deDression on the various Bourses. In that case it must clearly be impossible to speculate as to the period when an alteration will be witnessed. It may occur forthwith, or not for many months. If capital is being employed in the purchase of foreign produce or securities to an extent to drive up the value of money here and lessen consumption, while it creates an inflation of prices at the producing places, the check will ultimately be found in the losses of the operators. If, on the other hand, nothing of this sort is carried on, there will be ground to rely that no long time can pass before we shall at least experienee that degree of relative pecuniary ease which is the inevitable result of unwasted gains.
The formation of the European aLd American Steam Shipping Company was completed to-day, and the eight ships piurchased from the General Screw Company were duly transferred to them. They will be placed upon the Hamburg, Southampton, and Brazilian line and the Bremen, Havre, and New York lines as soon as the necessary fittings shall have been completed. The directors of the new company are Messrs. Crawford, Round, and Clive, and Captains Farquharson and Piteairn. The aggregate capacity of the eight vessels is 17,763 tons, and the nominal purchase price was 319,7501. less 6,3951. for commission. 33,681 shares of the General Screw Company have been transferred to the new company, and 13,591 have been paid off, representing the sum of 90,2181.
The Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China have issued a circular, stating that they " will shortly be enabled to commence business m a field where comnmerce is extending with extraordinary rapidity," and announcing two calls of 21. each, payable respectively in one and three months.
The English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank have announced an intended dividend for the past half-year at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of Income-tax, leaving 4,0151. to be carried to the reserved fund.
The prospectus of the Thames General Steamboat Company, with a capital of 120,0001., has been Issued. The scheme is partly French, in conjunction with the London General Omnibtus Company, and it is proposed to take as a nucleus the 27 boats of the London and Vauxhall and Citizen companies, others being added, with various improvements.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the adjudication against John Paul, the clerk of the City of London Union, charged with embezzlement, was disputed, and after the case had been partially entered into the proceedings were adjourned.
On Friday next the committee are to be appointed to inquire into the Bank Charter Act, the Bank Acts of Ireland and Scotland, and the law relating to joint-stock banks.

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Monday at Darlington; Mr. N. Plews in the chair.
The directors reported that, the final call on shares created in 1852 having been paid, the cawitI account was now closed, save as related to any expenditure by the Stockton and DarHngton Company (lessees) for permanent Improve. mwents, but which would in no respect affect the dividend.
Mdessrs. N. Ilews and H. Pease were re-electedirectors, and Mr. L Wilson auditor.
Aresolution requestingthe Stockton and Darlington Com. pany to remit the guaranteed dividend (6 per cent.) was also agreed to; and the proceedings clowed with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
WEAR VALLEY.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Monday at Darlington, Mr. P. Smith in the chair.
The statement of accounts showed that 783,950b had been received on shares, and that the present loan capital moun1ted to 37,0001., maling a total capital (inclu ing some receipts aspremium, &c.) of 823,2031.
The statement of accounts was then received and
Messrs. Heppie and Johnson were re-elected directors, and Mr. C. Robsn auditor.
A. request was rade that the Stockton and Darlington Company would snd outdividend warrantafor the guara
teed six per cent, with their own, and it was considered desirable that this company's sihares should be converted into
preferencestock of the Stockton and Dazlington Rail a Tote of thanks to the chaiajn closed the proceedings.
COLCHESTER AND STOUR VALLEY.
The statement of the accounts of this com ny to the 31st of December last shows that the directors have applied he half-year's rent received from the Eastern Umnon Ra'il

BRADFORD, WAKEFELD, AND LEEDS.
The report states that the masonry, tunnel, and oth&r works are maidng satisfactory progress, but that the earth works are in a backward state in consequence of a continuation of bad weather. About 50 yards of the tunnel remain to be completed, and the bridges and other works are nearly finished. The cpital account to the 31st of Decemboer last sihowrs that 143,655 had been received, including 49,650l. on loan, and 142,1471. expended; leaving a balance
STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON.
The report of the directors of this company states that the revenue accounts for the hlf year ending December 31st hlst amounted for dues on minerals to 129,911; for merchandise to 24,3831. ; for passengers, mails, &c., to 17,351L ; and for rentals, &-c.> to 1,745L-total, 173,3911. The way, rolling stock, and other appliances are in excellent oider. Of the sum expended during the half-year about one-half is for rolling stock, and the remaining moiety on account of the new branches andtation accommodation. The board have received overtures for rlations of a more permanent character between the company and the Middlesborough and Guisborough, and Darlington and Barnard Castle companies; these have been entertained by the directors in a liberal Spirit. The intended commumcatiou between the eat anwest coasts, known as the South Durham and Lancashire Union aili , now waits the sanction of the Legislature. It Is difficult to estimuate the amount of advantage to be derived syecially to tho iron trade from this communication, or its undoubtedly beneficial effects upon the prosperity of these districts. The board recommend that out of the balance of profits remaining afterpayment of all interest, preference dividends, and rents, a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum be paid on the ordinary shares of the company. The accounts show the receipts on capital account to have been 1,599,1731., and the payments 1,46o,9241, lervine a balance in hand of 132 2491. The expenditure on capital account during the last Kglf-year was 61,8041. The revenue account for the half-year ending December 31 showed that 173,391L had been received and 95,240& expended, leaving a balance of 78,1511. The interest on bonds amounted to 9,255., leaving 68,8961 available for rentals and dividlends.
DORSET CENTRA1L
This company's line, f-om its junction with the SouthWestern Railway at Winborne to Blandford, a d;^tance of 10 miles, was sanctioned in the last sesion. A bill is now before Parliament for extending the line from Blandford along the vale of Blaclmore, a distance of 24 miles, to the Somerset Central authorired line at Bruxton. It appears that the inhabitants of the towns and the landowners along the line are in favour of the project; some of the latter hau stipulated to take the value of their land req for the railway in shares of the company. The Sbimct of the line Is not only to accommodate the traffic of the district, but by means of other lines to complete a continuous line of railway about 70 miles in length from the English Channel at Poole and Southampton to the Bristol Channel at Eighbridge. From this point to Cardiff and Glocester it is proposed, by means of suitable stamers, to open up tho coalfields of South Wales, aDd the Forest of Doa to the central parts of Dorset, and thus supply the inhabitants of Glastonbury, Bruton, Temple Combe, St4.bridge, Sturminster, xNewton, Blandford, Wimborne, and Southampton with coals at much less cost than at present- at the same time affording rapid communication from tie agricultural districts on the alie to good markets It is expected that
the coal traffic, including that from Radstock, wil form an important item of revenue.

The Late Duke Of Rutland.
THE LATE DUKE OF EUTLAND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The interest which I have reason to think my anecdote of the lato Duke of Rutland has excited will, I believe, be increased by the following Circumstances which since I wrote, have come to my knowledge. The little chapel-school at Rowsley is now merely a school. The Duke, finding the rural congregation numerous and devout enough to deserve better aocommodation, built s. modest butprettychapel of stone, which twice everySundayisamply filed with rural worshippers. This building he ornamented with a memoral window In remembrance bf the young and amiable Lady John Manners, so early lost and sD deeply lamented by the domestic circle to whose happiness she seemed destined to add a more permanent Increase.
One of the last acts of the Duke's life was the setting aside a sum of money towards the erection of a parsonage-house for that little hamlet.
Some minor details of his Grac's liberality, delicacy, and piety in this matter have reached me; but I have said enough, I hope not too much. I had totally forgotten the " memorandum" that I had made in December, 1848, but happening last Friday, when looking for something else, to find it in an old pocketbook, I thought it would be injustieo to the memory of a good man and a dear fxiend not, under your favour, to put it on public record.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

! mTHB DOVEl? ATAIZ P CAOKBTS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I feel assured that with your accustomed impartiality your will aUow me to say a few words in reply to a somewhat spiteful letter in your paper this day.
In announcing his subscription of 51. towards the Violet Fund " H." aserts that " I the reDeint exhibitions in London and Paris, and tho additional transit occasioned by the Russian war, have enormously auFmentGd the dividends of the Dover Mail Company, thait this is the first serious accident that has occurred to any of their boats, and the com. pany have for years been conveyn the public across the Channel in ovorcrowded boats, penned together on deck like cattle in a railway truck."
You will doubtless be surprised to find that there is scacly the slightest foundation forany of these statements. In the first p lace the Dover Mall Company was formed only in April, 184 ; consequently it had nothing to do with the London exhibition, and the Russian war diminished rather than increasedthe number of travellers across the ChanneL Secondly, " enormous dividends" are urely a fiction; no dividends whatever have been share. Thirdly, with respect to the first serious aceident, I am sorry to sa your columns hae furnished evidence to the contrary. astly, I"H." must have altogether mistaken some other steampackets for the Royal Mlail vessels, for the latter are never crowded. During the whole of last summer the 300 ton snail packets never at any one'time had 100 passengers on board. The average number carried is, between Dover and Calaisn from 40 to 60 sunmmer time, andfrom 20 to 30 duing winter, 'while the Ostend maxil packets seldom have abov'e 50 in the summer season, and about a-dozen each trip during the winter months.
While regrtting that "H." should impose upon the pblic a letter containing so ranny mistakes, Ibe to inform
hmthat we have in our employ as many of the orphans of the poor fellows rho weere wreclked in the Violet as are eligible, and we are onb too sorry that, on account of the lossirehav sutaied,we oul no afordto contribute amon us oretowads he gnerafun fortherelief of the sufferers th I amSbront 150o1. ogenrent bervtL

AETROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS.
A pcia meettng gf the board was lela bnTuesday, all the Council-chamber, Goildhall, foi the purtem of further
cocs g the report of the comtnitke on ih subjebtbf f o t'.oi parlm in certain parts of the re-topolia; Ur. Thwaftes in the chair. I
MTIIOPOLItTA PARKS.
lr. WRIGHT, in rising to submit to the board a reiolttion that imnediate measures be taken for the establithSnent of two parks, one in the south-eastern and one in the northern parts of the metropolis, obseroed that if . lins were passed through the Angel, at Islington, and the El1phant and Castle, in Southwark, the inltropolis would b3
eidd into two equal parts, and that the population on tbo western side of that line; in 1851, was 1,189,825, and on the eatern side it ws 1,175,299. Since then the populition bad greatly incresed. The accommodation proiided far those residing on the western side of the line consisted Mf seven parks, while the inhabitants living on the aea%rp side had only the enjoyment of one park. On the westmrn side of the line there were Kensington Park. 261 acr*0; Hfydo Park, 388 acres; Green Park, 60 acres; St. JAMAs Park, 91 acres- Regent's Park, 472'acres- Batterse3 Pare, 34S acres; and Kennington Common (;iich was now X park), 19 acres; making in the aggregate 1,637 acres for ths western side; whereas on the eastern side there was onli' Victoria Park, containing 265 acres-jest enough to fori6n-
cemetery for the whole population of that portion of the metropolis; while no less tnan mix square yards of pleasure groun appropriatedto everyinhabitant onthe westorni aide. The importance of parks for the ase of the pabli6. both in a moral ana sanitary point of view, could not, be disputed; and the necessity of the subject being immediately
ded upon was equally ap-arent. In proportion as the number of buildings increas1 and the lines of houses were extended would be the distance at which vacant spaces would be available for the purposo of the establishing of parks. This would not only enhance the monetary value of the land, but would at the same timo diminish the public utility of the parks, by rendering acDess to them more dif. feult by reason of their grear distance. The deferrI of street improvementa would not be attended with any increase of expense. Middle-row, Eolborn, for instance, might be removed next year at the ume cost as it could this
ear. With regari to the estivates made by the oommlttie lo believed they approximated as near as posible to e- cury. The committee had not confined themselves t4 map and commpas, but had inspected the ground itself. an bad mdet eir calculations upon the best ascertaineod data. The committie considered that the cost of forming a park of adequate dimensions for the locality of Rotherhithe and Bermondsey would not be less than 100,000., and thAt the cost of the proposed park at Finabury would probablenot be more that 200,000 , of which it had been representt
that the Government would contribute 50,M0f0 He concluded by moving,-
"That Immediate eAmesue be taken for the establshment ot w Mer's mee in the south-eastern ad one In tbe nosthem Dart.a of tba, metyoPoll, s. recommpended by the Work.' CoDmmittee; ancd that, apesrt rom an otelbutlen to b obtained from Government, the etpens be equalli' asesed upon the Whole metropoUls.
Jfr. SAVAGE seconded the motion.
Mr. DIFyANGRft cordially concurred in tho motion, his only objection to the proposition being that it did notgo far enough. It ought to include Hampetead-heath. Pablic opinion had already declared itelf in favour of Hampsteadbeath being secured for the use of the inhabitants of this vast and overgrown mctropolis; but it was weU known that unles it were obttained from the prosent lord of the manor the difficulty of gaining oseion of it would be very great indeed, if not insuperable. etherefore begged to move 4s an amendment tha after the words " the northern part of the metropolis" the words "and for the purchase of Hemp-
teadheat"be inerted
The CLEimy (Mr. Woolrych) explained that by an accident a motion of which Mr. Wright had given notico ws omitted from the agenda paper; the terms of the intended. motion were-"That the Government be oommunicatei withto ascertain if they would join with the Board in the purchase of Eampstoedaheath for the use of the public, ana, if to, to what extent.
Mr. W arGxT said if the present motion were carried it was his interition to submit the one just read.
MIr. D'`IFANGXU was so impressed with the importance of preserving Hampstead-heath for the public that he felt compelled to persevere in his amendment.
)IrIows oould not endure the idea of Hampstoed-heath beinR set aside. He should therefore, although conourring in the orignal motion, second the amendment.
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR, thought the motion was inconsistent with the resolution passed by the Board on the 4th of June last, in which they declared that it ws of more importanoe to adopt street improvemnents than to establish parks.
The Cswuswr.u deCided that there vwas no such incotvastency as tomake it necssry to rescind the resolutioua of the 4th of June before proceeding with the present
Mr. Deputy HARPIsoS was strongly opposed to the recommendations of the committee for the formation of these parks. No accurate estimate had been made as lo tetE probable expense that would be incurred. It was said, indeed that Government had promised to give 50,000R. towaris forming Finsbur-park; but had the committee any positive assurance to that effect? They knew nothing about it. His advice vas that the matter should be referred back to the oommittee to ascertain that fact before the Board pledged themselves to expend the money of the ratepayers for establishing a park at Finsbury. More dotailed information was required with regard to all t_he points referred to in the report of the committee, and lie would strongly urge that it be referred back to them for further consideration, and that in the meantime the coomittee should confer with the Government, to ascertain whether they were willing to contribute anything towrds toe ensc, notonly of Finsbury Park, but also of the park ir Rotnerhitho, and likewise towards thepurchase of HEmpstead-heatb.
Mr. SELXY observed that the Board had no alternatiia but to act upon estimates. Positive data could not be obtained. The Board was now called upon to assort the broad principle that those things recommended by the committee ougbt to bo dono He was willing to admit that the expense, including the purchaso of Mampstead-heath, would
500,000L But that was not a matter of any great umportance. B readin t a certain space of time
nthe ate least d ttO*U. nte. d in farthings, and he hid ilot the least doubt that the majority of the ratepayers
would vote in favour of the proposition.
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR differed from the hon. gentleman In that opinion. What occurred In the important parish of
Marylebone when itwas proposed to the ratepayers that,£ farthDg rate should beoraise for establishing a free library? Why, they rejected the proposition altogether, and his friend Mr. Nicholay, who presided on the occasion, had becorue very unpopular in consequence of theo course he then pursued. Pub l parks, no doubt were desirable, bat they ought to be obtained without ipsn onerous taxes on the ratepayers
fr. COLLESOx and Mr. Drxox warmly supported the motion; while Mr. V, STEvENs, Mr. HARRIs, and Mr. BEVAN as strenuously opposd it.
Mr. Alderman Cuzrx, M.P., said he should not be satisfied with giving a silent vote on a matter so important to the health of the inhabitants of the metropols which was becoming more crowdled every day. It seemed- to him that it would be a disgramceto the Board if the proposition before them were to 'be met with a ntpative. He always thought that one of the chief things lr which the Board would obtain great credit with the public was the ettablishiog of these breathing places for the toiling and pont-up thousands of this metropolitan population. (Rear, near.) He regretted extremely that his two colleagues were of a different opinion. If the inhabitants of the city of London were dissatisfied with him for voting On this subject in a way which vindicated his own independence,
lthough he mightregret it, yet he must saythat if they were smen who looked more to their pockets than to the health of
te metropolis they were not worthy of being his constituents. (Hear, bear.) He should cordially support the orlginal motion.
Mr. R. TAYLOnopposed the motion. He was requesteld last Friday topresent a memorial for the formation ofa park at Lambeth, but he deferred doing so, s he understood that a similar application was about to be made by the inhabitants of Camberwell. (Laughter.) His opinion was that, as
alte parks now existing had been formnedat the public expense, so ought all those to be which might in fiuture be established,
Mr. Swowv reminded members who opposed the motion on the ground of expense to the ratepayers that one great cause of an increase in the amount of poor-rates was the want of health amon the labouring classes, and that that want of health was chielly owing to the want of pure air and of the means of innocent recreation. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. WALLIS was opposed both to the motion and the amendment, becauseihe wasof opinion that there wereoother great workis which ought to be carried out by the Board before they engaqed in the formation of parks If they were to purchase in the most densely-populated parts of the town the houses that now constituted the narrow courts and alleys, where disease and vice equally prevailed, and were to build onuthe sites better houses or the poor, they would be promoting not only the sanitary condiitilon, but the moral feelings and dispositions of the inhabitants of those impura
Captain BAlxrr said the district he represented had passed a resolution condemning the measure for establishing parks, but b9lieving, as be did, that it would tend greatly lo beuefit tha dshct,he should gve ithis cordial support
bl. OFFOR said his district had also called upon him to say "nay" to the proposition before the Board, but he felt bound to carry out the conviction of his owin mind, and to Vote for the motion. (Hear. hiear.)
ar. kEw observed that he had the full enjoyment of St. James's Park, which was established out of the genera
taxs', and it would be selfsh in him, becauso he poAessed a11 that he required, to say that others at a distance should not have the benefit of a park, because it would impose a very small rate on the inhabitants of the metropolis gendrally.
Mar. WtIGHT replied.
The amn ndment.was then put and negatived, and the 2D f 2ntionwAscarried by a majority of 12, there being
IAS D-AD-11MA. T-
Mr. WRIGaT then moved-
"ThattheGoerenm be bocommuIacLted with bomeminwhber they would join with the Boasrd in the Puciase of Hsinpvtcs.dheatht, and to wbat extent.'
Mr. SAvAGz seconded the motion.
Mr. LAwxns moved as an amendment-
Tbat the Government boocommunicated with to asceean whether they would purchaeiamp b*Ahctlhfor the uo tbepublic." ib
ho amendment, having been seconded was put and negatived bya majority of 1O-8 being for and I8 against it.
Mr. Deputy HARmsox ed whether the motion referrA only to rapstead-hesth proper, or whether it included thet ad' ining land st forth in the committee's reprt
lr. IGdT sid his intention weas to inclu,d the whole lnd mentioned in the report, and be would amend his ,motion by inserting after the words " Hampsea-heath' the folloing words-" A reomendo by th Committee of Works and Improvements." b

LO&DON, THUBSDAY, YIEBBUAJY 5, 1857.
In the House of Commou3 yesterday, on the report upon the Address,
Mr. 1ADF)rLD complained of the omiessions in the Royal Speech, particularly in respect to the colonies, dwelling upon what he termed the degra. dctio, of the people of India.
Admiral WALcoTr commended the caution, cele. rity, and efficiency displayed by the government of Bombay in preparing the expedition to the Persian Gulf and by the officers in command of the forces.
Sir J. FnIrERALD made some observations upon
the cotton cultivation of India, and upon the defi. ciency of transport.
Mr. V. SN=H explained the difficulties which beset all questions concerning the land in Tndia.
After some observations by Mr. K nLwA', the reDort was agreed to, and the Address was ordered to be presented to rER MAJS1TY in the usual manner.
Mr. CRAUPURD obtained leave to bring in a bill to render judgments or decreets obtained in certain Courts in England, Scotland, and Ireland, recTectively, effectual in any other part of the unsted kingdom.
The House adjourned at half-past t o'clock.

Every schoolboy, at least every English school-
Every schoolboy, at least every English school, boy, is astonished and disgusted to read that, while HAwiiAL was fighting his way up to Rome, a furious faction was refusing him supplies and damaging his credit at home. It must have been the demon of mischief itself that had the heart to spoil so splendid a game. Yet the sequel, absit omet, apparently justified the seeming virulence of party. The truth is that conquest must ever be an open question. We need not have any fears for the patriotism of our country or for our own because we find in ourselves a general misgiving as to the wisdom and justice of two extempore wars with semi-barbarous nations on the other side of the world. That such wars should arise, and that they must arise, if we only resolve to maintain a certain position, is evident on the smallest reflection. The tribec of Central Asia from time immemorial have maintained their independence and fought their way into occasional ascendancy by continual trickery and treachery; playing not merelytwo games, but half-adozen at a time, always playing off one neighbour against another, and relinquishing an obligation the moment it became oppressive. Certainly, since the days of NADIR SrAH there has not been a single year in which a good case might not have been made out for exterminating every nation and tribe of Persia and Affghanistan from the face of the earth. But, on the other hand, they had each and all of them a most manifest case for our annihilation, had it been in their power. Some mean, however, there must be between two cases so mutually destructive. In China we meet with the opposite difficulty. Instead of a hundred tribes, it is one people, and that the most settled in the world. They have no more wish to conquer than to be conquered, and are only too happy to be let alone. All their little stock of roguery is concentrated on this point, and, as it is their only defence against that universal spirit of conquest which possesses the "' outer barbarians," it must be confessed that they have reason on their side. Yet, as foreign aggression will stiU advance on them, and commerce itself is lawless and encroaching, the poor fools are driven to their wits' end for subterfuges and delays to put off the day when Europe will rush in like a flood upon them. Then they have their own vices, for they are but barbarians in silk. They are too suspicious to be wise, and too cowardly to be faithful. It is only a question of time when the quarrel breaks out, and we can have a war with China as readily as we can broach a barrel of ale. Here, then, on the one side, is conquering destiny, national spirit, fatal facility, provocation, justification, and, in a word, the certainty of a war some time or other; and, on the other side, all those less audible, less visible pleas of moderation, humanity, and caution, which certainly have their place even in the progress of empires. As a general rule, and it was not broken in the debate of Tuesday night, the former class of these considerations is fully represented by the statesmen in power-the latter has not less justico done to it by those in opposition. Is it shameful to confess that we ourselves give what is due to both of them?
Does anybody doubt that if Lord Day, or Mr. DisRAuLi, or Lord GREY, and we know not who, were in power, they would be quite as prompt to give Persia a taste of our quality as Lord PATMainSTON and his Foreign Secretary ? Does anybody doubt that, had it been their fortune to open the ball, Lord PAMxnsoT and Lord CaLxMOnOX would have had some very severe things to say of them, and some exceedingly mild sentiments in behalf of the poor Persians and Chineseo? For our part, we do not remember with much satisfaction either our former diplomacies, and subsidies, and wars in defence of the gates of India, or our former war with China. It certainly does recur to the mind with increasing force that both these calamities might have been averted, and that they were calamities. It is alleged by the PsEhsnx and his colleagues, and may be true enough, that Persia behaved well, observed her neutrality, was civil to our people, and kept her hands off Ierat, till the capture of Kars gave Russia, as is said, the supremacy of Asia. Granting this, one may reasonably suspect that, had the restoration of Kars to Turkey been allowed time to work into the mind of the East, Persia would by this time have seen her mistake and returned to good behaviour. We did not, however, give the unhappy culprit time to profit by this lesson. To all appearance we were resolved that she should not mend her ways. Lord CLAxDO N insists much on the unsatisfactory reply received from the Persian Prime Minister on the 25th of September, and he favours the House with a very forcible rejoinder from his own pen, containing a long string of grievances in addition to those already before the public. But on the 25th of September the word had already gone forth for the expedition to Persia, and Lord Cn.&mmnow's answer, dated October the 10th, would probably arrive at Teheran just in time to explain the capture of Bushire. We are not denying the advantages of celerity; we have already done justice to them in this instance; but they are rather military than moral, and we recognize them inthe extreme care taken to blind the eyes of the British public to the serious measure actually in operation. If it is any comfort to the Shah of PERSIA, he may rest assured that the British people at large were as little aware that he was to be attacked as he appears to have been himself.
Again, we very readily grant every word Lord CLARLWDON says about tho Chinese quarrel. It proves, however, rather too much, for it proves that with a people so jealous, so cowardly, so weak, and so obstinaWy in the wrong, we could easily tako our own time for the quarrel. The Chinese empire is torn to pieces; the rebels are in force only forty miles from Canton; the river and the seas swarm with pirates; the Chinese Treasury is exhausted. Surely, in such a state of things time was our friend, and we had only to wait a little and find everything at our disposal. Before long we may possibly have news that the British force is engaged in rescuing Canton from destruction, supplying Ymr with shipping and rebuilding V'ne river forts,not to say aibsidizing the impracticable Commissioner. It would not be the first time
thatwo destroyedafleet only to miss it in the hour of need. We have already admitted, we own with reluctance,that the rupture was inevitable, andthat, as Lord CLARENDONsays, the mere refusaloftheChinose to carry out the former treaty and open Canton to us was sure to lead to this result. Yet many a thing that must be done, and ought to be done, is done ill at last ; and we could certainly wish that Sir J. BownnG and his advisera had taken care to have a better case for the quarrel that was to be in this instance. Cannot statesmen hit on some* way of stating these affairs not quite so encouraging to our host of colonial governors, com-
manaders of stations, and other remote and insulated British authorities? Why are a dozen great men, each of them himself ready enough to argue, to reason, to woothe, or to temporize, to put their heads together to back up every hasty official in every part of the world ? It is quite enough that we must carry these men through, at any cost of men, money, and character, when they get us into a quarrel, without encouraging all the rest to follow their example. This British broadside, even in the background, is too much for official flesh and blood. It is a giant's strength, and he will use it as a giant. The voice of conscience and the relentings of humanity are only to be heard through the mediura of faction. Lords DaBBy and GRzY and Mr. DISRIE have come to the rescue of British moderation and philanthropy; but one is forced to ask what would they have said and done had they been on the opposite benches ?

"That matter of the murder is hushed up;"-
4" That matter of the murder in hushed up ;"so runs the first line of the most terrible tragedy which hns been given to the world in modern times. Certainly, we are far from saying that the right hon. member for Bucks at all resembles the Count CEroi in character or antecedents, but the brief quotation -with which we have prefaced this humble expression of our astonishment must have occurred to most persons who on Tuesday witnessed the affecting reconciliationbetweenMr.DisRA;iandMr.GL"sToNx. Why, it was but yesterday the one tore the champion's belt from the other's loins. They were relatively to each other as Turk and Russian, as deer and deerhound, as hangman and hung man. It seems, we say, but as yesterday that the DEBBY Administration was tottering to its foundations-our Parliamentary friends, we trust, will find the phrase equal to the occasion-and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. DIsnA,I, rose in his place to defend his estimates and his policy. How it happened in the course of that last stand that he exposed himself to the murderous fire of his opponent it is unnecegsary here to relate. Few persons, however, who witnessed the sequel will ever succeed in effacing the terrible picture from their memory. Awful as the three Erinnyes to the panting OExsTxs, or as three proctors all in one to a young Oxonian who has been caught, gownless, capless, and red-handed, in the flagrant violation of some academic rule, Mr. GLADsroiE rushed in upon his exhausted adversary. He had him down, and he kept him there. The Finance Minister of the three kingdoms, the successor of ROBEBT WALPOLE, of WILIAX PITr, of ROBERT PEEL was rated like a truant schoolboy. Sentences from '7he W7hole. Duty of Man, from Cicero De Qtflcif,,-we had almost said from the Catechism, were hurled at his prostrate foe by the eloquent and elegant champion of all the virtues. It was, perhaps, the first time in our Parliamentary history that a Government was fairly proctorized out of office; but so it was. Mr. GLADSTONE was the executioner, and Mr. D]rsAIrar the patient, on that memorable occasion. A change has now come over the spirit of that dream. The former opponents are in appearance reconciled, and have united their weakness and their strength against Lord PALMMSTON and his follower. The reconciliation is not only in appearance perfect, but it is artistically carried out. We all know how great is the value of combination, and what great things can be accomplished by the force of coteries. Thus it was the Lake poets rose to great renown, and that all exclusive societies contrive to retain a hold over the imaginations of mankind. How much greater is this power 'when two gentlemen, apparently foes, come forward, and each is compelled to acknowledge that the other is in the right, and he has no alternative but to act with his former opponent I Imagine PA=Is to admit that there was a good deal in what M z&u.s had to say, or the representative of the depositors in the Royal British Bank publicly to express an opinion that the representative of the shareholders had made out a perfectly good case, or Serjeaut BuBBLE in full Court to throw down his brief and declare that he had no resource but to shake the candid and manly hand of Serjeant MUDDLE. Surely such a spectacle would greatly impress itself upon the imagination of the bystanders. Thus it is that, 'when MIr. DIsRAui the other night was scattering roses upon Mr. GLADSTONE's head, it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that, after all, that eloquent speak-er must greatly deserve the confidence of the nation, since he could win such compliments from his bitterest Parliamentary foe. When the grateful GLADSTONE, in return, brought into prominent relief the more striking portions of Mr. Dis&ra's address, and in honeyed accentx wooed him to repeat at the table the secret history of that awful treaty which, as the frivolous PRiERrm declared, existed only in the imaginations of Parisian ilycatchers, equally irresistible was the conclusion that, if this unhappy country is to be saved, Mr. DisBAEI wfil have a large share in the salvage. It was not only the matter, but the manner of the res gestx, which was so significant. Mr. GLADSTONX and Mr. DisBA.a were, as our French neighbours would say, aux petits soins with each other. Each would obviously have wished to help the other on with his great-coat. At one or other period of our lives moet of us (with the exception of M1r. Baron BRA-WELL, as he has himself informed us) have been in that mood in which an enamelled locket is considered as much a " neees" sary" as a pair of stout boots in wet weather. Such was the mood of NIr. DISRAELI and Mr. GLADSTONE the other night with regard to each other.
After all it was a strange scene, and the significance of it does not lie very deep below the surface. The present position of Mr. GLADSTOfJE -we should rather say the position which before Tuesday night he seemedresolved to retain-is, or was, hopeless enough. How could a gentleman, however unquestionable his ability or oratorical power, ever hope to attain to office in this country when he condemned himself not to act with either one or other of the great parties into which the House is divided ? We use the term advisedly, although it is the fashion to say that parties are at an end. Traditions, however, and common sympathies and common prejudices have not yet completely lost their force upon great occasions. Let the great ma5s of members run riot as wild as they will when there is nothing serious at stake, yet, when the question substantially arises as to whether the representatives of the Past or the Future shall carry on the business of this country, the opposing phalanxes will keep step and time to admiration. Now, in neither of these arrays could MIr. Gya&STONE serve or command. It is not, therefore, surprising that he should make a step forward to regain the confidence of his penultimate friends. Alone, or only with the support, which is daily decreasing in power, of the late Sir ROBERT Pr'S pupils or Paladins, he can do but little. In the Lower House he must fight the battle well-nigh single-handed, and in the.Upper Chamber the case is stil more desperate. Let not the British public
therefore groan over Mr. GLADSTONE, because he seeks to replace himself under conditions which will epen to him once more the possibility of ad administrative career; We have often enough had occasion to challenge his acts and to differ from Lis conclusions, but we are ready to acknowledge
that it would be a great pity that the country.
should be permanently deprived of the services of so efficient a man. We must always remember that if Mr. GL;ADswNo and his friends are under a Parliamentary taboo, which, with the exception of the brief period of the AuznENDR Administration, has spoilt their political career for upwards of ten years, it is because they did resolve at all hazards to carry the principle of Free Trade. The subsequent acts of a man who has proved himself capable of so considerable a sacrifice should be liberaly construed. After all, a General must sigh for an army. The leader most profoundly versed in CASAM9S Commentaries, in Jo3irzi, in the history of the wars of MARTBOROUOn and NArOLEON, can scarcely hope to hold the field atthe head of acorporal's guard. Such isMr. GLADsTor scase, and if in his conscience he believes that the financial settlement of '63 is really the best for the country, we can afford to smile at his sentimental reconciliation with Mr. DISB&EW.
The case of Mr. DirSAnu is a little more complicated. Experience, we presume, has shown him that not even all his own quickness of wit and readiness of speech wi enable him to hold his own in the teeth of a combination composed of the most practised debaters in the House. During the brief period of the DPRny Administration the whole burden of the day was cast upon his shoulders, and if his strength fairly gave way under it the result implies no discredit to his unquestionable ability. In his own party he can but hope for the support of half-a-dozen commonplace men of business, who are quite unequal to -the exigencies of a field-day in the House of Commons. Such an alliance as that of Mr. GrADSTONE, if he could persuade his party to acquiesce in it, would be of the utmost consequence both to him and to them. Two men can make a long fight of it, when the energy and fortitude of one almost inevitably give way. It is sad work to look round and see none but unreliable or hostile faces, which will certainly k-eep the promise of their expression. A fortnight hence, then, AMr. Disn.&nr is to move his financial resolutions, and he is to have the support of ?;fr. GTADSTONE. He will have all the disadvantage of playing in the dark, as the CHANCELLOR of the EsCHEQUER will not then have shown his hand, and it is too much to expect that the House will condemn the CHANCELLOR of the Excuxmuun unheard. That, however, is a tactical point which must entirely be left to MIr. Diss&zLf s own diacretion. Meanwhile, in Baconian phrase, we note his reconciLiation with Mr. Gn&sToNE.

The Income-tax is a tax which for every panny
The Income-tax is a tax which for every penny in the rate of assement brings a million of pounds sterling into the Exchequer. Sixteenpence in the pound yields just sixteen millions in clean hard money, with no great expense in collection, and with a greater certainty, precision, and completeness than is the case with any other impost which the genius of financiers has been able to devise. But this is not aU that the Income-tax raises. It raises half-a-dozen constant, keen, and interminable conflicts of principle, keeps large classes of the people in a state of chronic discontent, and at every period offering a chance of relief throws the whole island into profound agitation. It is a tax which everybody is fain to use, but nobody is ready to justify, which does our work for us while we murmur at it, which was never quite sanctioned and yet could be never quite dropped, so that in the end, as Mfr. GLADSTONE expressed it, we went living on with it from year to year, like children afraid or regardless of the future, and content with providing for the present.
Such being the Income-tax, what are we to do with it? Proscribe it utterly-name, substance, and all ? That would be to destroy the most formidable weapon in the armoury of the State. If money means the sinews of war the Income-tax is the very essence and vitality of the whole muscular system-" an instrument," as Lord DERBY said, "of vast energy and effect, exhibiting in the "strongest degree to foreign countries the "immensity and power of our resources for war." Shal we make it permanent? That would be to make injustice, impolicy, and discontent permanent-to attach a character of durability to measures only tolerated upon the express assumption of their being transitory. Look at the debates on Tuesday evening, and observe, the terms in which the tax is spoken of. Look at the speeches made all over the country respecting it,-the notorious inequality of its incidence, and the impossibility (as it seems to many) of fiding any way to equality. What shal we do with it, then? What its very nature aud character suggests-keep it for times and seasons as exceptional and as anomalous as itself,-for periods when money is wanted in mighty lumps, and when, so long as it is found, nobody asks how,-in other words, for the needs of war.
But we are not at war now, and yet we have an Income-tax of which more than half is avowedly a war contribution. No doubt, but war, as far as expenditure is concerned, does not always terminate with fighting. BiUs remain to be paid which are still war bills, although treaties may have been signed, peace proclaimed, and jubilees celebrated. That the Income-tax, at its present rate, shall cease and determine on a given day is already provided, such day being not far off. What is more, the whole tax is actually doomed to extinction as a peace tax. Not only the war 9d. but the peace 7d. lies under sentence of death, to be carried into execution this time three years. The impost, in fact, as at present constituted, is twofold in its formation. There is, in the first place, the original creation of Sir Ronr= PEui, maintained by one Minister after another, and finally adopted by Mr. GrADmSONE in 1853, on conditions of a terminable existence expressly defined. Then there is the superstructure, the upper stratum, laid on to meet the exigencies of the Russian war, and framed only to last for a still shorter period. In both cases there is finality staring us in the face. The road has been rough, and the lane a long one, but, at any rate, the turning is well in view. As to the war 9d., whether the CHrA.&cLozo of the ExcHEQuEr should be required to forego the letter of his bond and capitulate on the spot, or whether, as was suggested in the debate, the operation of an act of Parliament, however accidental, in furnishing Government with means should not be too narrowly or jealously viewed, provided the application of such means were satixfactory, is a question which can be discussed better after we have seen the actual figures. As to the other, however, and more important point, that of the Income-tax in its general and comprehensive character, we entirely concur with the opinions so decidedly expressed on* Tuesday evening, that 1860 should see the last of the daty until the inexorable voice of war shall be once more heard. e
Whatever may be said of the Income-tax as actually levied may be said also ot direct taxation abstractedly considered, for no statesman has yet been able to embody the elementary power in any other practical form than that of the specific instrument with the. gripe of which we are so well acquainted. If it is impomible to settle a fair and acceptable .rate for the Income-tax, that is as much as to say that it is impracticable to employ direct taxation without inflicting injustice md, creating discontent. There are two propositiona which seem as well established, or, at any rate, are as steadily, safely, and continuously asserted, as could well be the case with any political axioms in this highly critical and argumenta,-
tive age. The first is, that a distinction ought to be drawn between permanent and precrious incomes; and the aecond is, that to draw any such distinction is beyond the power of mortal financiers. We do not ourselves profess to accept the dilemma as inevitable, but there it is, thrtst in our faces as a practical conclusion whenever the Income-tax comes under discussion, and it follows, therefore, as a direct and necessary consequence, that an impost operating with so much injustice should be reserved as an exceptional instrument for exceptional emergencies. It need not be assumed that these emergencies are to bo recognized exclusively in the demands of war. As a matter of fact, we have been paying Income-tax through 12 years of peace, and by so doing have placed the finances of the country in a state of unexampled prosperity. But when, with these ends in view, Sir 1BOBZIT PzEs proposed the tax he was careful to introduce it in its proper character. It was still an extraordinary arm brought out at a crisis, though the crisis was not one of war. Its aid was invoked in the first place to restore a salutary proportion between the income and expenditure of the State, and in the next to smite and scatter a host of foes pressing as injuriously as hostile squadrons on the energies and commerce of the nation. Its duration was fixed because its work was specific, and when it had answered its purpose it was to be disused, and laid up in store for the next occasion. The period of consummation retired, it is true, as we approached it, but the temporary character of the impost was still always avowed, and its existence was only prolonged by a succession of short leases, not always very cheerfully granted. At length MIr. GLADSTONiE had the boldness to look the difficulty in the face, and not only said that the tax should terminate, but provided for the possibility of its termination. He as1ked a longer respite than was ever given before, but he made the execution of the sentence more certain at the end. In 1860 the requirements of the Exchequer will be diminished by the natural extinction of the Long Annuities; and the Succession Duty-a duty representing the least objectionable form of property-tax-will have come into full play. We trust, therefore, to see the settlement of 1853 receive full effect. Its provisions were devised in a comprehensive spirit and with a liberal consideration of conflicting claims. No person can say that property and income have not contributed their share to the national treasury when both wil have been taxed for 18 years, of which onlytwo were years of war, and when the former remains taxed in perpetuity. Mr. GLAnSTONxS lease was a long one, but more than half of it has expired, and with the end of the thing fairly in view we can afford to wait for Sir 0. LEwIS's estimates with patience, and consider them with reasonable minds.

OPposrrox TO THE IN;COmE-TAY.-Last eveninm a crowded meeting of the inhabitants of Chelsea was held at Lloyd's Assembly-rooms, Sloane-square, for the purpose of considering the expediency of petitioning Parliament for a repeal or modification of the income-tax. Mr. Richard Malins, Q.C., M.P., occupied the chair. Letters of apoloDy were read from the two members for Middlesex, r. . Osborne and Lord I. Grosvenor (amid repeated cries of discontent), and also from Viscount Chelsea. The chairman, in introducing the business, urged that the present income-tax fell heavily on many classes of the comrmunity and contended that the people could not bear it till the A ni of 185. He had done his best to show to the Chance,lor of the Exchequer that it would not be countenanced as a continuance, for he felt that, as the increased amount was pat on to assist the Goverment in the prosecution of the late war, it ought to have ceased with the waer. (He, hear.) Mr. Austin then proposed te fin reltion, to the effect thati inasmuch as the incoSe.axwas increased from 7d. to is. 4d. in the pound for tbi expreof purpofe of carrying on the late war, the continuance of the same at its present amount was, in the opinion of that meeting, most unnecesry and unjustifiable.

The Don Pedro landed 76 passengers into the Lisbon lazaretto, and had on board a full cargo of sugar, coffee, and wood. Sho was kept five days under quarantine at St. Vinent's, and her long ran from Madeira wasattributed to strong and contrary winds, although the weather was beau.- tiful when she left that island.
From Rio de Janeiro mercantile advices state that 17,000 bags of coffee had been sold after the departure of the Tyno, at 4,000 to 4,450 reis, ac.ording to quality, chiefly low European lots. The export duty was to be Again raised to 11 per cent. on the 1st of January. Business continued interrupted by constant rains, and was not expected to revive until a couplo of weeks after the end of the old year. The money-market was tight, and the exchango on London 271 to 28; tock, 102 to 102A per cent.
At Bahia the sugar-market was very buoyant, notwithstanding the extra 2 per cent. export duty, commencing on the 1st of January. Prices paid for any brown sugars, 3,000 reis ; good Chantel browns, 3,100; and 100 reis more for the southern markets; whites, 3,600 to 4,200; coffee, 4,300; cocoa, 4,800; dry salted hides, 300 reis; cotton. 6,100 to 6,200.

The yellow fever prevAlent at Pernambuco was repre aented to be in a mild form, and only among the shipping.

The Unemployed Labour Of London.-Yester-
T} z'Us>AzxoyzD LABoux oF Lwmon.-Yesterday, st the weekly meeting of the directors of the poor of St. Pancras, held in the Vestry.haDl, Camden-town, Mr. Churchwarden Streeten in the chair, a report was presented from the committee of labour, stating that, to meet the de. mand, a temporary additional accommodation for the purposes of labour had been obtained by an agroement with Mr. Cnlverhouee for the use of his wharf in the Camden. road, with the sheds, &c, thereon, at a rent of 30. for the first month, and 261. for each month afterwards. This 'aharf, &c., would afford sufficient space for the employment at stone-breaking and oakumnticking of to persons. From Wednesday, the 28th day of January, to honday, the 2d inst., both inclusive, orders for work had been icsued to 168 persons, and the foUowing was a return of the number who had made use of such orders On Wednesday, January 28, 10; Thursday, 29th, 10- Friday, 30th, 14; Saturday, 31st, 7; Monday, February 2, . The committee reportedthaton Monday a bodyof men to the number of nearly 200 presented themselves to the relievingofficers late in the afternoon as applicants for reliet', and the necessary questioning, recording their names, ad. dr.sses, circumstances, &c., and the relief of them occupied the officers until after 8 o'clock at night. As similar appli csations might be looked for daily, the committee strongly nrged the rigid enforcement of labour, either at carpneter. ing, atone breaking, or oakum picking, from all app'acanb capable of doing wvork, rAdfor w^hich the p^remises ^^ecured afford ample raccommodation. Mr. Church. warden Wyatt, on moving the adoption of this report, mid, on the previous week, when 180 of these alleged unemployed made application they were all reeved at once with 21b or 41b Ioares, in accordance with their family. On the previous afternoon, when the men came, there were a large number who had been offered labour tickets during the preceding week, but had refusoeL There were some also who admitted that they had tickets in their pockets for that day, hut they had refused to go to work. 'he applicants were d the house, and out of the whole numcer there were but three who availed themsdves of it When told there was an order for their admission the invariable reply was, "I don't want to go into the house." On a ticket of labour being tendered it was,
"Oh, I am not going to your stone breaking." The fact was that she persons were not destitute, and there wa some sort of political movement in the matter. (Hear.) The re!srt was carried unanimously.
.kxEcuTrIOrN AT LI;LITGOOW.-On Alonday morninn Peter M'I,ean was executed at the county town of ianlithgow, for the meurder of Thomas awe, at Bath-
te, on the 16th of November last. The recommendation of the jury to mercy, and the memorials in his behalf, having been unfavourakiy answered, the necessary arrangementa were made for the fulfilmebt of the sentenc Caloeraf t was tnhged as executioner, with the assistance of a young man named Peddle, from Dundee, and the Edniburgh scaffold was obtined for the occasion, the gibbet belonging to the burgh having been in disuse for 39 years, and having been recently sold for firevood. A detachment of the 6th Dra goon Guards, from Edinburgh. wrere ordered to the spot, but their services were not required. The event occasioned considerable excitement throughout the mining populatio3 of the county to which both the convict and the murdered man had belonged, and even the firemen at some of the iron-works refused to perform their necessary duties, in order to witness the execution. The whole crowd that as. sembled, however, would probably not exceed 4,000 or 5,000, and the proportion of women present was small. The unhappy convict bad been in a distressed state of mind smce receiving the tidings which destroyed alE hope of his life, and had very eagerly listened to the spiritual admonitions of the Rev, Dr. ell, the parish minister, and the Rev. Mr. Webster, the prison chaplain He made no confession, but admitted that he might un consciouslyhavestruck the fatal blow,he being then furiously excited with drink. On Friday he held a last interview with his wife, who was tried along with him and William Mansfield, but acquitted. Mrs. M'Lean, while leaving the
ison, declared that her husband was guilty, but that Miansfield was as culpable, and should have got tho same sentence. M'Lean received great attention on Sunday from hisaspiritual advisers. He did not go to bed, but sat up all night with the chaplain. He was visited at 7 o'clock on Monday morning by Dr. Bell, and,having engaged in prayer he was pinioned by the executioner. All morning he groaned and muttered in a piteous manner, and wras led out in a state of horror and exhaustion. When he took his place on the scaffold he faltered out, " Good people, take warning byme. Avoid evil company and drink, and keep the Sabbath." Without any delay the preparations were made, the dropfell, and tho wretched man died without a struggle.
NEWSPAPER PIRACY AT NTOTIRGHAM.-On Satrxday, the 31st ult, we traTnsferred to our columns, as frora the NoUingh2 ma Revczu, a very interesting account of recent festivities at Clumber-house. We have since received a communication from the conductor of the NoUinghiirnshire Guar-dian to the effect that the article in question originally appearedinhisown paper, and was pirated bytheNVouingham Reriew, to whioh we erroneoudy attributed its authorship. Our correspondent bitterly complains of the conduct of two of his contemporaries at Nottingham (the Review and the .Journal), alleg&g that tbey delay the publication of the6r papers a fe heurs in order to ernoy the benefit of the news published in the Guardiail, which is always appropriated without a word of acknowledgment. The Review, in fact (aording to our correspondent), is frequently mado up, word for word, from the columns of its more efficient oontemporary. This recalls to mind the old story ot the provincial editor, who, wandering in search of the pictursue, discovered, in a wood, the body of a man sus rended from a tree. His own paper was not to be published or three days afterwards, so, to prevent a rivd contemporaryfrom anticipating his own announcement of the "dreadfut suicide, he removed the corpse further into the wood for the sake of concealment, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion as a murderer. We can only expreas
our regret that we should have innocently endorsea the
forged utterance of the Notitngham Revico, but we feelt bound, at the same time, severely to reprobate th eai And dishonourable practice-too common on the the provinial pres-of pilfering intelligence and panit of£ ahsorigtinl.a A very " lticket-oleave" man would be

STEW YORK, JAI. 21.
1inoe the 17th inst. we have had here three days tf a treraendous illustration of the power of winter. What our condition hasbeen may be imagined from the condensedstatementthat figures astp`e " heading" of the weather department of a morning paper of yesterday. It is a Summary of five c-):uins of 'Oescription in five lines; but those lines are vigorous :-" Tough weather-a tremendous snow*torm-the stores empty-the gas out-no mailsno noise in the streets-a terrible gale-the tele. graph wires down-the railroads sunk-wrecks on
the coast-threatened failure of oysters-mercury I freezes, and a spirit thermometer registers 40 ,degrees below zero 1" If the chill of this announce-Went is not a little thawed out in crossing the Atlantic it ought to give your readers a touch of the sensation felt in passing an iceberg. It creates a slight shiver to read it; but if there is a little exIaggeration, it is more by the combination of the -details than any untruth in the details themselves. In fact, the whole continent fromCanada down to the Potomachasbeenvisitedbyanus5uaUysevere snowttorm, accompanied by a degree of cold very rarely felt, as with the fall of snow the temperature generallEbises. There had been a " cold snap' before Sunday the 18th, which had brought the thermometer down to zero. That was very well to begin with; but about noon on Sunday the storm -commenced with a strong cutting wind, continuing iiearly 24 hours; the consequences are nearly as -sbove described-we are snowed out and iced in, the railroads are blocked up, and the mails neither arrived nor departed on the 19th and 20th; the attempts to clear the tracks with snow-ploughs failed; some of the telegraph posts have been blown down, butnot all ; those that have stood the gale only bring the negative consolation that matters are nearly as tad west, north, and south. The position of iNew York-on a peninsula, with the sea between the city and its chief suburbs-exposes the metropolis to great inconveniences during such periods of -severe cold. The ferryboats, capitaly as they are built for summer service, cannot contend with the ice beyond a certain point, and if they are stopped the embarrassment is extreme, and the dilemmas, comic and serious, of those who cannot get into the city, or, being in, cannot get out, are manifold. BRents in Jersey, Brooklyn, Hoboken, and other places are something lower than the awful value of ground in New York proper will allow, and are chosen as residences by the economnical. In summer, 'when the communications are frequent and safe, the arrangements work very well. But a few 'days of the embargo we have had alters the whole state of things. No doubt thousands in the last three days have mentaUy resolved to give notice to quit, and remove their household gods into the expensive centre on Manhattan; but as soon as the ice clears they won't do it; they will go On as before. There have been several such ex.Veriences before, yet those suburbs have grown up -and prospered under them, and will continue to do so. The present visitation, however, has been a severe trial. Monday, the 19th, was a blank day for business; merchants, bankers, and clerks had got home on Saturday evening, at the risk of their lives in some cases, but the storm of Sunday settled the questien as to coming to town for Monday's duties. It could not be done. At the Exchange, Custom-house, the banks, the insurance-offices, and the law courts, everybody wanted was missing. BiUs took their chance of being met, railway stock could not be delivered, even prisoners could not be tried in the absence of prosecutors. There was nothing for it but good humour and hopes of a rise in quick-silver. Certainly the afternoon of Sunday, the whole of the night, and the next day was a time to be remembered. The wind sweDt the streets, Vlowing spitefuly keen and sharp; those it did not catch suddenly at a corner and double up it slowly -cut in two ; and the snow was not fair, honest snowlarge flaked and falling softly-but a vile, small dust, piercing as needle points, and driving horizontally"sharp sleet of arrowy shower." It was utterly im-. possible to face it, at least without a Crimean beard, in 'Which, for winter wear, there is ,wisdom. As to the quantity of snow, I have seen a greater accumulation in the latitude of London; but here it is capri. -ciously distributed, and the drifts lie seven and -eight feet deep in some places, while others are quite bare; so that with aU the cold there was stiU no good sleighing. The appearance of the streets on Monday, the 18th, was completely changed. Some of the omnibus companies brought out their sledges, with four and six horses, but achieved no great success; many kept their wheels, though they also required double teams to keep them floundering along. The street railroad ,cars made a few and very slow trips; a good pair of legs beat all of them. Altogether the street itrafflic was so diminished that the life of the city was silent and muffled, and tho eternal rattle of Broadway ceased. There was a little scraping and shoveling going on, and ridges of snow five and six feet high gr-ew along the pavement, but in most of the streets the work is left over to the next thaw. There wre other miseries of this Arctic period which rate and tax paying householders may appreciate better than a correspondeat vwo is " only a lodger." The Croton waterworks froze up and cut off the water supply; and the gas went out extensively,through the city, which was of less consequence, as there was nobody abroad worth robbing; that fact having been ascertained by the theives, they disappeared. It is rumoured that the police disappeared with them, at least simultaneously. 'There was only one burglary, but a dozen fires from overheated stoves.
No fatal accidents have yet been reported, with the exception of some wrecks on the coast; but on the afternoon of Saturday (the 17th) a dreadful -catastrophe nearly occurred on the East River, between Brooklyn and the ferry at the foot of WVallstreet. The ice became so firmly packed that a few persons crossed the chaunel on foot. Yery soon hundreds were crossing and returning, and there was a kind of jubilee on the ice, with much hurraing, but a total ignorance of -the peril; at the turn of the tide the field began to break up, but the warning shouts of those on shore who saw the dauger were not understood by those midway on the stream; at last it became
evideut to several hundred people that they were cut off fron the banks on each side, and were -rifting away. Had not some tugs and steamers with great difficulty pushed into the stream and thrown out ladders to the panic stricken crowd, they must have been drowned. As it was, they had the narrowest possible escape.
The alarming state of the thermometer all over the country has produced a speculation as to the possible existence of slavery within the present frigid zone. At Lawrence, in Kansas, on the 7th inst., the mercury marked eight degrees below zero. The F,Apress says this is practical abolition, since "'if b fee can stand that, there may be slavery in Oireenland." 'Unfortunately for the theory, Cufee las stood and does stand it in regions where the glass at present is no higher.
Yesterday New York began to be itself again; the heavy, gray mass of clouds had discharged their burden or rolled away, and the sky was bright and blue once more, with a sun as brilliant as summer. The wind went down, and everybody's spirits rose in Bpite of the thermometer, which did not quite share the general elevation.
In the night of 'Monday the snowr ha i hardened; the drifts of the side walks had been rhovelled over the roadway, and very soon therewas a winter carnival throughout the length of Broadway. Sledges of every variety came out. The monster omnibus, drawn by six horses, with a lofty curved prowv, like a classic war chariot, affixed to a low platform, and seats holding altogether as many passengers as can be packed into or hang on to it, swept along a little cumbrously. The driver, far aloft, and relieved from the ignominy of taking the faresthe open nature of the transaction not allowing ithad nothing to do but drive, and with his ix in hand looked quite another being. He evidently felt so, too, looking down on the small fry of dingy freight sledges with justifiable contempt; with that team and the ponderous machine behind it he could grind any of the smaller equipages into chips with a turn of his wrist. The private and pleasure sledges, which supersede the brougham, are very gay indeed, perfectly finished, of capricious shapes, the horses very lightly harnessed and hung with bells, the occupants almost buried in buffalo robes and furs, and other wrappings of brighter colours. How the ladies pack in is a mystery only solved when they are shot out, which happens at times; but the " party" sledges do hold several more than can find legitimate sitting room. Iu the country a spil into a snow drift is rather fun than otherwise; but city sledging is comparatively slow, and exacts caution, especiaUy in Broadway, where we are frequently jammed into a rank and must keep to a walk; in the Avenues the pace is better, but then in Broadway are all the shops and all the world, and we come out to be seen ! For a few hours yesterday the whole of the thoroughfare was a holyday spectacIe, gay in colour and ringing with music, for three or four miles; in the clear air the sleigh-bells are very musical-a light, cheerful, and mnceasing chime. The sordid, working-day cartr had disappeared, and even the sledge-drays that perforce took their place, though dirty,-were not silent; they had their bells, and added to the noise and novelty of the scene, which appeared to put everybody into good humour. At 4 o'clock all was going off, cold, bright, aud exhilarating-like iced champagne. It was a compensation for the three days of dull misery that preceded it.
The steamer for California has been ordered by telegraph to wait one day for the mail from Washington. No mail train has arrived from the Federal cities since the 18th, and it is doubtful whether any will come in for some days.
The Committee on Territories will, it is under. stood, report a bill cancelling the whole body of the laws of Kansas, on the ground that they are invalid, having been passed by a Legislature imposed on the people by non-residents. The formidable minority of the Republican party has had an immediate influence on the policy of the Governmentwithregard to Kansas; and the change of that policy has compelled the Pro-slavery invasion to abandon the field as hopeless, though at one period the free settlers appeared to have been " crushed out." The Algerine code of laws which they always resisted will now be abrogated; it is a Free-soil victory, which, however will require to be followed up to be secure. A new election is to take place as soon as possible; every challenged voter must not only swear he is a bond fide settler, but prove by two witnesses he has been for a month preceding the election an actual resident in the ter. ritorY, and for 15 days a resident in the district in which he votes.
The committee of inquiry at Washington-the political inquisition, as it is called-continues its sittings, and, it is reported, has obtained something more than moral conviction upon charges impli. cating certain members for New York, but the secrecy of the examinations is very well preserved. The Sergeant-at-Arms despatched in pursuit of a fugitive correspondent of a Philadelphia paper telegraphs that he has got that individual; but, it is added, "the snowstorm has rgot them both." The Washingt-O U-ion, which from long experience has a perfect knowledge of the ferrain, admits that some of the past proceedings of Congress htave been inexplicable by ordinary motives, and infers the, existence of weakness somewhere from those proceedings and the extent of the temptation. It says,-
" Perhaps there never existed a public body exposed to greater temptations tban the Congress of the -United States. Having in some measure assumed tha position of a public almoner for the relief of everything and everybody, having the abeolute disposal of some $60,000,000 or $80,000,000 amnually, and some 700,000,000 or 800,000,000 of acres of land to give or throw away, it is not to be wondered at that this hon. body, so redolent of nourishment, should attract tho crows and kites and vultures from far and near. Accordingly, it is openly charged, and exten. sively believed, that the meeting of Congress is a signal eor assembling all the birds of prey."
The correspondent of the New York Times was again called before the committee yesterday, and asked " what members of the House had ever requested him to procure them pecuniary interests in pending measures?" He refused to answer the question, as he could not do so withoutt breach of confidence. He states that to-day the committee will ask the House for an order to conumit him for
contempt.
There is a Northern Revolutionary Convention sitting at Worcester, Massachusetts. The title re quires explanation. It is a convention of the extreme Abolitionists, who believe that the time is come for breaking up the Union of the United States, as by its sanction of slavery it has become " a league with death and a covenant with helL" The North and South, they say, being as different as the most distinct nations, ought to separate, and both sections go the way their respective systems lead them. The movement in present impracticability about balances the wild talk of some Southern leaders of marching on Washington, seizing the archives, and taking possession of the Treasury, in case Fremont was elected President. None of the present race of politicians can be found to support this repeal movement. The best thing the convention has produced is a letter from Theodore Parker, of Boston, who approves the discussion of the question, partly because, as the South has cried " wolf " upon disunion so often, it may do them good " to have a glimpse of the real animal." But he does not desire a dissolution at present. He thinks it would not be right "c for the powerful North to back out of the Union, and
leave the 4,000,000 ' poor whites' and the 4,000,000 slaves to their present condition, with the ghastly consequences that are sure to follow." But he adds, " If the North and South ever do lock horns and push for it, there is no doubt which goes into the ditch."
The decrease in the number of American seamen in American ships has for some time been very marked. By law two-thirds of the crew of every merchant ship ought to be Americans, but the act is a dead letter. It is stated by competent authorities that not one sailor in 50 of the crews leaving American ports is a native. The law is necessarily evaded, compliance with it being impossible. Good seamen of any kind appear to be growing scarce as losses at sea increase, and the premiums on marine insurances are rising; this is ascribed to the inferiority of the crews as a clas A bill is now before Congress providing a system of apprenticeship on board American merchant ships, the number proportioned to tonnage, a a remedy for the evil.
The Swiss residents in New York have held a meeting to sympathize with their countrymen during their present conflict with Prussia. Some strong
patriotic speeches were made, and a subscription opened for aid to the Swiss cause in money.
The repudiation, or possible repudiation, of California seems to have opened a dincussion on the old sins of Pennsylvania, and certan shortcomings, even in its repentance, which have not been forgotten. On the 17th a reception was given at Philadelphia to Mfr. G. Peabody, the well-known banker, by Mr. Allibone, the president of the MerchantU Bank of that city. There was a large reunion of the notabilities of law, commerce, finance, and literature. Perhaps the conversation turned on California; at aU events, the occasion was dexterously improved by Mr. Peabody in a reference-more in sorrow, he said, than in angerto by past financial transactions. Having "received the congratulations of his friends with his usual grace," Mr. Peabody, while surrounlded by 20 or 30 " leading statesmen and financiers of Pennsylvania," told them he felt a strong wish and entertained a hope that the State would ere long wipe tho stain of repudiation from her escocheon by paying all her bondholders the back interest on the bonds of 1846. These bonds, it appears, which bora an interest of 6 per c-nt., were payable in 1846. They were not so paid, but the creditors received 5 per cent. bonds for them, payable at the " pleasure of the State," and that after adding, not 6 per cent., but only 4i to the principal for the time the old bonds had run. The pleasure the State anticipated in paying up it has never allowed itself; the creditors have not only lost the 11 per cent. due to them for several years, but the new bonds themselves have depreciated in value and passed into the bands of others than the original holders, who sold under the pressure of Wall-street bears, the general shakiness of the State credit, and recollections, perhaps, of Sidney Smith'a sarcasm. Pennsylvania ought to pay-he is very rich, and has elected a President-the full arrears of interest, gtving the smun due to the original creditors as well as to the present bondholders. 3r. Peabody holds, it is understood,400,000 dollars worth of these bonds, but "he wished it to be distinctly understood that he was not pleading for his own purse, for he pledged his word that every penny of back interest he might receive should be handed as a free gift to some Pennsylvanian institution," provided the State paid the said arrears. What the effect of the combined admonition and inducement will be is doubtful. It is to be feared Mr. Peabody would be more successful as a donor than a creditor; any amount he would give the drab-coloured men would be readily taken, and perhaps the broadbrims would join in another Peabody ovation as great as that at Danvers some time since, borrowing one of the banners displayed onthat occasion, which bore this Scripture text and rhymed comment thereon:-
"The Lord loveth a cheerful giver,
"And so likewise does the receiver v
The monition to pay is received in expressive silence.
The United States' steamer Washington arrived yesterday with Captain Hlartatein, the officers, and crew of the Resolute.
It is announced that the trains for the West will be able to recommence running this afternoon; but it is not expected that any of the roads will be able to work with regularity for the next three days.

New Steam Frigates For The United States'
NEw STAms FRIGATES FOR THE U.NITE STATrS N.&VY.-The Baltimnwe American publishes a letter from a correspondent who has visited the United States' Navy Yard at Gosport, and gives a long and interesting account of the twin steam frigates, Roanoke and Colorado, which are now approaching completion. A fow days since steam was raised on the Roanoke, 351b. to the square inch, when the engine was found to work with remarkable smoothness and regularity. She wil make a trial trip s-ome time during the month of February. "The engines are direct acting, and directly attached to the propeller shaft. The cylinders are 79 inches in diameter, having a length of stroke of 36 inches. The propeller has two bades, is made of composi. tion, is 17 feet 4 inches in diameter, and so arranged as to be easily disconnected, and hoisted up when the ship's canvas is usedl. It weighs nearly 23,0001b. The iron shaft con. neoting the propeller with the notive power is 1O0 feet in length, while the shaft alley which contains it is 12 feet long, 18 feet below the water, andlae enough to admit of
passing each other within. The who a of te machinery is
low the water line, including the boilers, so as to have it better protected against the fire of an enemy. The boilers, four in number, and containing 16 large furnace, a-re tubular, and of the kind recently patented by Mr. Daniel B. MaTin, engiceer in chief of the United States' Navy. The boilers weigh about 28 tons each, and are located from athwart ships, by which arrangement a great saving of room and more complete ventilation are effected. The chimney, or smoke pipe, is telescopic or sectional, and cannot be seen above the hammock rail when sailing, and can be easily hoisted to the required height when steaming, in order to produce the desired draught. The length o lt he d a one Is 262 feet between prperndiculars from billet head to taffrail 306 feet, bre ah of beam 264 feet, depth of hold from the gun deck 264 feet, burden 3,000 tons, Her present armament consists of 40 shell gun
though sheis pierced for 60, and can easily carry them wbenever such immense cannonading power is recLiired. Each of her pivot guns weigh about 12,0C01b., without carriage; each of the others, 7,500 ; total weight of armamnent, without carriages, 309,0001b. It is also stated that, like her five consorts, sbe will tbrow, a greater weight of shot in the same time (and that of the most destractive kind known to modern warfare) than any other war vessel adoat. The keel of the Roanoke, says the core. spondent, is composed of two thicknesses of white oak; -the keelson of vhite oak plank six inches thick; there are four other live and white oak keelsons, two on each side of the main keelson, all which are heavily bolted with copper bolts. The immense frame is of live and white oak, 12 to 14 inches thitlk, cross strapped with strong diagonal bracings of iron, the bracing being continued fore andaft, and securely bolted to each timber. All the timbers of the hull were obtained in Florida and Louisiana, and have been seasoning for Eeveral years. The ship contains four powerful capstans, with a complement of force-pumps able to throw a stream of water 150 feet, which wi answer the purpose of a fire. engine. Near these pumps is the cookesgal are eog
to cook for 500 mnen. The other frigate, the Colorado, is so much like her twin sister, the Roanoke, that there are but three or four men in the Gosport Navy Yard able to dis. tuinlih the vesemls, The engines for these frigates were built at the Tredegar Works, at Richmond.
CzN-=AL Arca=xA.-The population of the vast territory of Cenitral America, is at .present only aboutt 2,000,000. Its capacity with a population about as dense as Massachusetts would be about or nearly 20,000,000, or as dense as Belgium not far from 50,0000. It has a situation unsurpassed by any portion of the world, not excepting Great Britain, for commercial purposes. Forming, bl a narrow isthmus, a separation between the great seas which constitute the -field of navigation and comprise the theatre of foreign commerce for the globe, and being very nearly central m latitude between the poles, it is, in fact, commner. cially, the centre of our world. It is naturally the narket overt for all human traffic. Its narrow extent from sea to sea places the ports of the Atlantic and Pacific within one day's run by railroad from each other. There are, at this time, but two routes of transit, one at the Ba of ama, in the extreme South, beyond the territory of these States, by railroad, and one across Nicaraguaby river and lake, with
la tttage of 15 miles, from San Juan del Norte, on the
c, to San Juan del Sud, on the Pacific. Two others are about to be constructed-viz., one in Honduras, consisting of a railroad extending from Puerto de Caba%ios, on the Atlantic coast to Snu Lorenzo or Amiapalla, on the, Pacific, in the Bay of Fonseca, distance 160 mifles~, which we understand is to be commenced the ensuing spring; the other at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in Mexico, which is already commenced. Both of these new routes will pro. bably b open for passengers and freight within two yeari. That which is the third named has, in the opiniono r Squier, advantages over all. others, It has excellent ports a6t each end of the route, a most imprtant element, which is wanting at Tehuantepoc, This la=trOute is 30 or 40 miles longertban thatof Honduras, TheBayofFonsecaisoneofthe fluest, most capacioust, and most commaodious on the whole Pacific coast. It should have a resident consular officer of the United States; even though the raiiroad should not be made. This, however, is sure to be done -without delay. In addition to the advantage of commercial situation Central America has,for the most part, a salubrious climdate and a soil of exu~berant fertility, producinig all tropical fruits in excess and a crop of Indian corn each three mionths throughout the Iear.-Ne York rToum-al of Commerce,

Meeting Of Convocation.
I MEBATNG OF CONVOCATION.
Yesterday morning, according to ancient custom, Convoeation assembled in the Jerusalem Chamber of the Chapterhouse, Westminster.
The proceedings were opened by prayer in the
UrPzi Houg.
The Moat Rev. the Axchbislop of Canterbury presided, and there were aso present the Bishop of Wimchester, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of St. David's, the Bishop of Oxford, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Bishop of Glocester and Bristol, the Bishop of Chichester, the Bishop of Exeter, the Bishop of Llandaff, and the Bishop of Salisbury.
The Bishop of CurcsxsTrx rose to present a petition, signed by 16 of the clewr of his diocess, and one on a most important subject, which he believed would alvo be brought under the consideration of the other House. The petitIoners stated that in the order for the burial of the dead contained in the Book of Common P;ayer it was directed that the said service should not be used for any that die unbaptized or excommunicate or isho had laid violent hands upon themselves; thattheservioe ielf was unsitable to such Cons, but that from the present state of the law its in-
mmnhuse wvas in fact practically enforced, and a heavy burden thereby imposed upon the conscienee of the clergy, as well as grievous scandal given to many Christian people. They therefore prayed that convocation would give sucg attention to the subject as the magnitude of the evil seemed to demand.
The Bishop of OXFoBD said the sabject was one of great importance, and he. was awar that in his diocess a petition having reference to the same queson had been largely signed and was intended to urge the same prayer as that contained in the petition just presented by his right rev. brother. There were no doubt cases in which it was most distressig to the consciences of the clergy to have to performthebural ervce, but hethought that the expression, "indiscriminate usve,"coanttainedhin the Petition just pr
sented, rather over-stated the c ase. There were cases, bat
he oped not may, and they were of xuchapecuiarnaturo that he thought under no conceivable state of the Church would they be entirely remedied. Nor did he think that to a conscientious man any Ilteration of the words of the burial service would meet the difficlty though it might only be some words of the service which gieved th,e mind.. The words of the service undoubtedly might ony be used properly in the burial of those persons who did notdie separated from the Church by any act of the Church, or who did not dieinthe commission of actual and dedly sin. Those who complained of its " indiscriminate use; perhaps forgot that it was in their power by promoting a, sentence of excommunication against thoso who lived knowingly and wIlfully in deadly sin to cut them off from iU cliun to particip&te 'h th6 rites of the Church. If he was not misinformed, his right right rev. brother the Bishop of Chichester, had had a case of such a kirid within his own diocess recently, and where by the threat of ecclesiastical proceedings he had put an end to the scandal of two persons living openly and wilfully in a state of the most deadly sin. If in so grave a matter the clergyman consulted his bisaho
as it was his duty to do, lie (the Bishop of Oxford) should certainly advise that the service should not be read oversach as died manifestly in the commission of deadly sin. He had heard that it wasin thepowerof thebisbop tosheltera clergy. manwho so acted in compliance with hlisadvice - certainiy he believed they possessed at least a strong moral power to protect him from injury, if not le#&L In several such cases where he had been consulted by his clergy he had advised that the service should not be used; an din one case-the case of a person by no means belonging to the lower classes -the clergyman who refused the service was threatened with legal proceedings; and it was not until he (the Bishop of Oxford) wrote to the solicitor stating that it had been done under his directions, that tie threat was abandoned. At the same time, while he admitted these evils, it must be distinctIy understood that there could be no tamn with the words of the burial service, so that it might be used with little scruple for any, or that an dergyman could be allowed to ornounce what measure of hope might be used in the wlords in which he committed a body tothe grave.
The Bishop of CmiCaSTz said that Uin the cuse which had occurred in his diocess, and to which his rev. brother had alluded, he had not stirred in the matter till he had taken the opinion of the Chancellor of his diocess upon the subject. The case was one of incest. A young woman had been married to ayoungman, by wlhomshehad ad children, and on the death of her husband she had espoused her husband's father, by whomahe had also had children. The parties were living openly together when the matter was brought under his notice, and he at once felt that he could not ermint such great sndal to the Church and all good Chnstians. By the threat of ecclesiastical proceedings, therefore, he had compeled them to agree to a separation.
The Bishop of ST. D±vIVs quite agreed in the main point with the observations which had fallen from the Bishop of Oxford. The service as it now stood might gene. rally be used, except in those fewcases where any expression of religious hope was an absolute mockery-the casm of those wvho died obviously inpenitent and in the committal of mortal sin. But he fearei there mnst be many cases of this kind in large and populous parishes, where the facts very likely would only come to the knowledge of the clergyman after the case had been decided. It was quito impos. sible for the clergyman of a h2re and populous parish that,
consistently withlhis other duties, he could know all whose lives made them fit subjects for such proceedings as would terminate in their excommunication; and if by any extraordinary exertions he did become aware of all such prsons
it would be imposig far too great and difficult a burden on bimn to compel nimto institute proceedings gainst all such as rmight be living in open sin or flagrant heresy. It was, however, amostgratif>ying conclusion to the Bishop of Oxford's remarks that inhis opinion a bishop had power to protect the clergyman who, acting under his advice, refusod to read the buril saervice over those who died impenitent and in open sin. In the absence of any settled law, he (the Bishop of St. David's) should always think it his duty to sct as if such were realy the law.
The Bishop of WnsIcsxsp. said he had listened with great satisfaction to the opinions which were entertained on this question by his right rev. brethren, and which were alsoshared by himself, Many appeals of asimilar character to those mentioned had been made to him by clergymen of his dioce3s, and he thought he could safely say he bad given no advice either calculated to wound a tender conscience or to injure the clergyman in the eyes of the la, of Ms parish who often entered into such questions
ttnas zeas as the clergymen themselves. He had, therefore, recommended clergymen who were sometimes placed insuch painful circumstances, if they could see the matter in the same light with himself, to take care on the succeeding Sunday to choose a topic for their sermn suitable to the occasion, and to explain the motives and sentiments with which the burial service was used, nd he had reason to know that such a course of proceeding had been extremely consolatory to the minds of many who were prevmously much troubled
The Bishop of .xNZrmRcalso cted a very painful case, in which a clergyman had sought his advice with regard to using the burial service at the grave of a man whom he had had the misery of knowing died an unboliever and blasphemer. He had told that clergyman what he would do himself if similarly placed, and that was that no ear7thly consideration should induce him to say the words of hope sad Christian comfort over the corpse of a man who died with words of blasphemy against his God and Saviour on his lips. But while he felt that that was the course which he himself should take, he should feel doubts as to how far he was warranted in giving instructions to a clergyman to do that which might be a violAtion of the law, and the violation of which he, as bishop, might hereafter be called upon to judge. Of course, if he found he had the power legally to protect a clergyman who so acted he would do sO.
The Bishop of O.XORD quite agreed that they could not attempt to bear harmless any man in breiing the law, but he was almost convinced that the law was on their side, and that a bishoD was bound to protect his clergy in the course which he hinaself had vised them to take. He thought that in the very extreme cases that had been mentioned by the Bishops of Chichester and Exeter it would fallwithin the dutyof the churchwardens to institute ecclesitical proceedings against the guilty individuals. A clergyman in apopulous perish could not possibly take such steps against a parishioners deserving them.
The Bishop of LA;DAIj said it was quite impossible to think of altering or tampering with the words of the burial service; p rhaps, however, it might be desirable that somethiDg9in t e natora of an explanatory declartion should be subjoined to the service, which louldprevent its terms being misunderstood as was now too often the case,
His Grace the PxsmrrmxT said that he alsohad received mnany petitions on the same subject. which were signed by thousandsiof the clergy. BEnt after hearing a11 that ha been now sid he felt that the difficulty of the remedr was msuch greater than the difficulty of the evil. He h d been glad to hear the sentiments which had been expressed on this subject by his rev. brethren, and he was sure that the great body of the clergy would derive satisfaction from their being rade known to them.
TheBishop of ExxrTss asked permission to lay on the table a numerously-signed memorial addressed to their Lordshlip' Houee of Convocation, and having reference to the case of " Ditcher v. Denison."
The Bishop of WiNcuEsTER objectod to its reception, as not being in order. It was less a memorial than a remonstrance, inasmuch as its concluding paragaph said "It appears to us to befraught with oonsequences so disastrous and detrimental to the best interests of the Church that we cannot withhold our earmest remonstrance."
After a few conversational remarkls as to the nature of the memorial,
The Bishop of Exxrin said he would accpt the suggestion of the Most rev. Presdent and return the memori*i to the memorialists as informal.
The Bishop of SALISBURY presented a petition from the Rev. A. Osmer, praying Convocation to make no alteration in the arrangements with regard to the stipendiary curates, contrary to the principles recognized by the Church and the canons of the Church.

Thia t ooed cat the Gordiaun knot and Archdeacon Randll would now proceed with the motion of which he had given notioe.
Archdeacon R t DAL, l after expressing his dep regret at the loe he and the whole body of the clergy had sustained by the death of the late Rev. Canon Huasey, who so hbly seconded the prostion which e (Archdeiacon Randall) submitted to the House during the at session of Convoeation, and whose profound knowledg ofo the history and practihe of the Church and whose opinion for integrity and sound judgmentgave strength and encouragement toanyproposition wich he thought worthy of support sai that pro position would now stand upon its own merits. The anufect waseone that demanded the most serious consideration. The Upper House d clearly indicated that they thould give them an answer as to the contitution of the court of
ina apal. That thestion had not yet been fully lansweed. Theresolution that was passehwras rather an evasive answer. It only told the Upper House with what they would not be satisfied. In his op ron, they ought, on the contrasy, to tel that House and the country whatit was with which th would be xatisfied, otherwisnen b d by, parliament wopld come oft with some measure which they would by no means lke. Govenmenthliad already tried several measres which had not given satifaction. For this Government was mot to blame. The question he feared was one, unless speedily brought to a conclusion, that was likely to affect th ption of the Church of England as an esota blishesd C,huc That Church ws prt and parcel of the British consftition. There was a Chrch of whic he ha.filpenea do know something, which etly felt the want of a conneion with the Statie. He alluded to the Episcopal Church of the United States of America. That was their onlT complaint. For want of that standing in the country which a hoonexion with the State oonferrea that Church was shut from many advantages which the Church of England enjoyed. There were other Chureces not only conneated with the State, but which overruled the rights of the State-Churches posseseing p6wers of decision in cclesiastica cases m n tke last resort without any interposing power of the Govenment. This predominant wher of the Church prevaled in almost all Rtomantwholic countries, though it was a power wihich was, perhaps never fully cartied out exoept In purely ecclesiastial States. The position of the Church of England was between thesoetwo Churches, and was exempted from the evils incident to each ofthem. But the Church of England had her difficulties also. One of those difficulties was the want of a clear and distinct line of separation between the welesahstical and secular courts. They cod shnot be separated entirely. That was imposbible unless they fell into one of the two evilst e had described-either that of aving the Chunr h separated from the State, or of allowing the bnrchto pomse a paramount power over the State. This difficulty arose from the circumstance that tpere was no third power to settle disputes between the Church and the State. One of those two parties maustioe paramount; and that party would necessart y e the State. The State must ultimately interpret the law and compact which held the Chxrch and State together. W bat was that law and compcto ? It consisted of the formularies and articles of the Churh of Englandascomtained inthePrayerBool-.TheC,rownwouldaways exercie iLts ospremay in ecclesiastical eases in the final reort. It hbddomnes so ever since the Reformnation. The Statute of ApCmeate the 24th of Henry VIIL, considered spiritual jurisdiction to emanate from the Crown quite as much as temporal jurisdiction. That must be consiaere at fixed tDint. What, therefore, that House had to do was to give t e best advice they could to the Crown, in order that the power -which it possessed should be exercised for the benefit of the Church of England and of the country. He was of opinion that the law of appe albsould be administered by lawyers. &aroely any ecclesiastical cause arose with which temlporal rights were not in some degree mnixed up; while men whio were not law-
inhowever learnd seldom possessed a judicial mind. ut, on te other hand, the members of the Judicial Comn. maittee were not qualified, for want of previous study, to lay down what was the Ilaw On any patiular doctrine of the Church on which a question might be raised. By whom, then, were they to be advised ? They ought to be advised by the bishops. They were the proper persons to whom such questions ought to be referred by the Privy Council. Hie did not propose that any number of bishops should be added to that Council; but his proposition was that the Judicial. Committee should state the questionx for the opinion of the bishops, which opinion should be returned to the Judicial Committee of the Privy, Council, and that the final decison should be p renounced by that bod. I miht e firl - ssued that the bishops
woula represent the opinion of the Church np
that might thus be submitted to them. o Go,er ent could, even if they wished, have any influence over the bishops. They would have the questions argued before them, whetber by lawyers ordivines would depend upon the nature of the question submitted to them. He would not at present enter into details- he would, however, say that no opinion of the bishops or judgment of the Judicil Commite sbould be taken as ^ procedent, so as to be bindingin future on other courts. llis reason was that by degrees precedents in one province might advance in one direction, while precedents mn another province might proceed in a opposite direction, tilt at length the divergence might become so great as to create an actual schism in the Church. TShe Venerable Archdeacon then moved,

He never could consider the body of bifhomh as aequdteoy reprlenting tho spituality of the whole kingdom. Th pirituality was only duly represented by tl~e synod of each prov-ince. The position was not only against the constitution of the Cshui of England, but was contras e to the constitution of the Church CAtho1i*, in ancent times tho bishopst did not decide questions tof doctrine in synod by themselves, because it was tho be read in SeriptuLre that the biops and elders together decided such questions. The amondment he in. tended to move would provide that when an appeal was made it should go in the first instance to the synod of the

Both the motioni and the amendment combined two things which should be kept distinct-namely, the legislative and the judicia functions. If it were a qustion as to extdcting a fresh defnition of doctrine from the Scriptures, then it might be a matter of argunent a to who should be the persons to decide the matter.

For tnyasp&as the xsbject as to the pricipleon which the fn wcourt of appeal should be constitutedmhad been under consideration. In 1847 it was submittedt to a most influential committee of the House of Lords.

As the propoiton now stood, if the civil power--namely-, the Judicial Commrittee of the Privy Council, should not endorce the return made by the bishops, it would be placing that bodyv in a most painful position. This was one strong reason why the Housqe should net be hurried on to a premature conclusion.

STATisTics oF CRInm.-A blue-book, issue& en Tuesday, gives tables showing the number of criminal offenders in the year 1855. A considerable decrease in the number committed for trial is noticeable, which must ba attributed as much to the changes in the law as to the actual decrease of offences. The Criminal Justice Act of 1855 and the Juvenile Offenders' Act extend zbe power of summary conviction, and so cut off the supply of candidates fort trialby jury. There -were 25,972 COMMitMents for trial in 1855, against 29,359 in 185, and 27,057 in 1853. Them was a decrease of 22-3 per cent. in Mtiddlesex, of 20-3 and. 11-6 per cent, in Surrey and Kent, 20-2 in Monmouth, 19-2 in Cheshire, 9 4 in Stafford, 8 in Lancashire, 7-6 in Warwick, and 40 in Yorkshire. The decrease wasnot less remarkable in the agricultural counties, as in Suffollr, Dorset, Somerset, Berks, Lincoln, and Norfolk. An increaee occurred In Bedford, Bucks, Derby, Durhan (21-% per cent.), Northumberland, Notts, Northampton,
uoutbampton, and Worcester. Offences against the person show a alight increase for murder, but the frightful increase of 88 per cent. in malicious stabbing and wounding The newly-defined offenee of "assaulting and indictintg bodily harm" has risen 10 per cent, Violent offencg against property have alightly, and ordinarv offences Iinst property veryymtterially, decreased.

VAJZU., TUESDAY, FEB 3, 6 r.Y.
While the chances continue in favour of Pariis as the seat of the conferences on the Neuchbtel question, I believe that no decision has been come to either on that point or on the day the conferences will open. I fear that Swiss affairs have not advanced materially since I last alluded to the subject. Unfortunately promises were made by over-sanguine persons that the question would be settled in a fortnight or three weeks, and those proeaises have not been realized, and I am not sure they will be realized within the time specified. There is little chance of Neuchatel being again subjected to the authority of Prumsia, whatever turn things may take, but there is a good deal to do before they are definitively settled. Dr. Kern will remain as Plenipotentiary on behalf of the Helvetic Confederation, but there is no foundationfor the report mentionedin the Belgian papers that he takes the place of Colonel Bannann as Resident Envoy.
The French Governmentv will, it is said, defray the whole expense of the sojourn of the Persian Ambassador here, so that if Feruk Khan does not take away with him a high idea of the hospitality of this country it wil not be the fault of the Emperor. A new Bishopric of Teheran, in partibus of course, is to be instituted for the benefit of the Armenian Roman Catholic subjects of the Shah.
The Pays publishes accounts from the interior of Persia, which announce that the Governor of Candahar had visited Murad Mirza, the Commander-in-Chief of the Persian army at Furrah, on the 14th December. This fact, together with the departure for Teheran of the Envoys of the Affghan tribes, is regarded by the Pays as a complete proof that the entire of Afighanistan is favourable to the Shahl; and, further, that this position counterbalances the loss of Buahire, and renders the chances of peace more probable, as it will induce the Persian Government to make ooncessions.
The Duke de Montebello, a ci-devant Orleanist, is spoken of as the probable successor of M. de Morny at St. Petersburg, whenever favourable circumastances allow of that eminent statesman returning to Paris. Some months, however, will probably elapse before that event takes place.
The Count de Chambord's letter to M. Pugeot a few weeks ago, in which he alludes to the fusio as an accomplished fact, has, it seems, called forth a letter from the Orleans Princes denying that the term fusion means anything more than a family reconciliation; and that it must not be understood in a political sense, as no such fusiow exists.
The marriage of the daughter of the distinguished writer, M. Villemain,with the son of M. Targe who was Attorney-Generaltothe Courtof Angers, an Deputy for the Maine-et-Loire under Louis Philippe, took place this day at the Church of St. Germain des Priso The ceremony was attended by all who are most eminent in science, literature, and the arts in Pars, out of respect for the father of the lady.
A letter from Milan of the 30th ult. states that the satisfaction and gratitude expressed by the powt,lation of Milan for the Imperial amnesty has induced the Emperor to remain longer in that city than he had at first intended. The Ministers, and Baron Bruck in particulsr, continue to give hopes that ulterior measures are about to be adopted, and that the Emperor will shortly improve the condition of the Lombards by relieving them of a portion of the taxes with which they are burdened. The Emperor proposed to give on the following day a concert, to which the citizens were to be invited. Persons usually well informed add that if the Emperor was pleased with the result of the concert he would give a balL. A grand ceremony is announced for the 12th of February. On that day the Archduke Maximilian is to take the oaths to the Emperor as Governor of the Lombardo-Venetian provinces.
A letter from Florence of the 28th ult. gives the following proof of the liberal spirit which it says animates the Court party at present. The Government having to choose some municipal counclllors for Florence selected, to the great astonishment of the public, three former deputies of the Parliament of 1848, whose constitutional opinions are well known, together with the celebrated suraeon Ferdinando Zaunetti, whose Liberal principles are no secret to anybody.
Tne Moniteur de laF oUs publishes some interesting extracts from a report made by M. Becke, the Austrian conmmissioner for the improvement of the navigation of the Danube. This report is founded on the soientific plans prepared by M. G. Voex, a distinguished engineer. It is generally known that the celebrated passage of the Irongates divides the Danube into two distinct streams. The Lower Danube commences there, and extends to the Black Sea. This portion of the river is less rapid than the other It forms as far as Toultcha a magnificent navigable stream, 2,000 miles long, with a sufficient depth of water for the largest shipping, of which the number annually amounts to 2,500, These ships principally frequent the ports of Toultcha, Reni, Ismail, Galatz, and Brailow, where an active trade is carried on. At a short distance below Toultcha there extends, in the direction of the right bank, a rock, 32 yards long, which impedes the navigation of the river, without completely stopping it. At five milea from the same point a branch, called the canal of Sulina, varying in width from 75 to 150 yards, quits the river, and flows to the east, while the principal stream flows towards the south-east. These two branches enclose the island of St. George, which gives its name to the right branch. The canal, or Sulina branch, makes numerous windings. Its position is such that it is not possible tops from the canal into the Danube or back without a perfectly fair wind. The difficulty of the navigation is increased at its commencement, on one side by the hull of a vessel aunk there many years since, and on the other side by sandbanks, which narrow the channel, not anywhere too wide. Its general depth is from five to six yards, but in live different places, and particularly at the DeuxArgagny, it isbut from six to nine feet. Ships that drawv much water are consequently forced at those places to get rid of a part of their cargo. This oecasions much expense and a considerable loss of time. The greatest obstacles to the navigation of the Suhna are at its mouth. In the years 1847, 1852, and 185 the depth of water there during the greater part of the year was not more than six feet. The commissioners for the improvement of the navigation of the Danube recommend that the canal of St. George shall be rendered fit for the navigation of shipping by cutting a passage from one culrve to the other, so as to form a stiraight line in the directiow of the south-east, by which means ships may take advantage of every wind. Another advantage the canal of St. George has over the Surlna is that in its stream tow boats may be employed and one steamer may tow 12 sailing vessels, which cannot be done in the Sulina branch. The two banks of the St. George are higher and less marshy than those of the Sulina, and they are covered with treesuand grass. On the left bank is the large vilage of Kedriles, which would afford great accommodation to shipping. The magnificent forest of Kologarmai, close to the St. George, would afford the timber necessary for the construction and repair of shipping. It appears to the commissioners from all the facts collected that the St. George branlch of the Danube in the most advantageous for navigation of the three streams which fall into the Black Sea, and they recommend its adoption.
The Momiteur publishes the official return of the operations of the beetroot sugar manufactories for the season of 1856. During that time the number of establishments at work was 282, being nine more than in the corresponding period of 1855. The quantity of sugear manufactured was 53.979.866

Some important changes whe about to be made in the military organizationwof this emlpoire. Te Arc
duke Albrechti, v;ho ia at present Governor of BIumgary, will be placed at he ead of the Military Central Chancellery, and the Archduke William vill probably succeeduin brother In Hung . It is further stated tbat the Archduke AIbreclit will, as President of the Supreme Military Commando, have a neat and voice in the Cbinet. A comonisson, composed of Hunganians who enjoy the confidence of the Emperor, is now employe in drawino up a atatement of the most imperative wants of the province of Hlungary. It may be considered certain that a general amnesty will very soon be granted to the Hungarian political offenders.
At the concert which was given a few days ago in the so-called " Hall of the Caryatides," in the Imperial palace at Milan, 2,000 persons were present, among whom were some 300 Italian nobili. It is tolerably certain that the lower and middle classes in Lombardy are less hostile to the Austrlans than they were a few weeks since, but many of the high nobles are as sulkyi as ever. As has been said, His Majesty in well satisfied with the results of his journey, and you may therefore soon expect to hear that Baron Bach, the Minister of the Interior, has received another " grand cross," as a reward for the judicious preparations which, in pursuance of his instructions, were made for the reception of their Majestiies. It in well known that the Russians in Sardiniai have done all in their power to keep the high Lombard nobles from paying their respects to the Emperor and Empress, and consequently the Russian colony in Nice In regarded with no friendly eye by the watchful and suspicious authorities of Milan. One of the first things which the Dowager Empress of Russia did on her arrival at Nice was to form a nearer acquaintance with the Countess Borromeo, and, as that lady is a declared enemy to the Austrian rule in Italy, the condeseension of Her Majesty produced an extremely unpleasant impression in official circles. The hatred between Russia and Austria seems to increase from day to day, and I am assured that the dislike which is felt by the subjects of the Czar to the English is as nothing m comparison to the averaion which they feel for the inhabitants of this empire. It may be observed that remarks recently made in my presence by Russians fully confirm the oorrectness of the foregoino statement. The report that the King of Naples som6 days ago drove out to Caserta in a carriage, instead of goin by railroad, as was his wont, is perfectly correct. Shortly before the train was to start H-is Maiesty felt such a strong presentiment that some danger threatened him that he resolved not to make use of the railroad. HIe accordingly desired that a carriage might forthwith be prepared, anA when it appeared he left the city in such haste that he forgot to send notice to those persons who were in waiting at the railway terminus of what had occurred. In order to make the story complete it may be added that two or three hours elapsed before the gentlemen in waiting were aware that Hiis Majesty had quitted Naples by another road.
On the 8th of January the Emperor wrote to the Minister Couint Thun, and desired him to commission Signor Ferrari, the professor of sculpture at the Academy of the Fine Arts at Venice, to make, at the expense of the State, a full-length bronze statue of that renowned Venetiau traveller Marco Polo. When completed the statue will be presented by the Emperor to the municipality of Venice. On the 26th his Majesty spent some time in looking at such of the archives of the State as are kept at Milan. A collection of autographs of the German Emperors, from Sigismund and Maximilian L down to Ferdinand I., which was shown to the Emperor seemed to interest him greatly. The Venetians greatly lament the loes of the 14 or 15 fine pictures which were bought out of the MaIfrini gallery by the British Govermment, and it was for a time doubtful whether the Austrians would not prevent their exportation by buyincg them over the head of the English agent, tut Sir Hamilton Seymour " teased and worried" the Imperial Government until it consented to remain passive. The precious canvass will soon be in England, but when there it will afford little opportunity to the British cognoscenti of displaying their critical acumen. The plctures have been exhibited in the gallery Manfrdni for something like a century and a half, and their reputation has long been established.

SALE OF SLAVES.-The editor of the Warren-
SALE oF SLAYEs.-The editor of the Warrentown (Virginia) Whig was informed by Messrs Dickinson, Eil, and Co., auctioneers, of Richmond, that thegross amount of their sales of negroes last year reached the enormous sum of $2,000,000. Tho entire sales of other houses of a similar kind in Richmond would make the amount go over $4,000,000, and still the business is increasing. We ourselves, says the WAdg, witnessed the sale of 35 servants at an average value of $700. Negro girls not 10 years of age. sold for $800. If this work does not stop in a short time Virinia Wil be stripped of nearly all her negro population -all owing to the agitation of the infernal negro question by the fanatics of both sections. One of the negroes mentioned above, a roagh carpenter, nearly 40 years old, brought $1,615. In Wiliamsburg, last waek, Mr. R. Saunders, executor of the estate of the late Rev. Scervant Jones, exposed for sale some 20 slaves, all of whom commanded a most excellent prlce. A negro woman named "Dolly," between 50 and 60 years of age, sold for $725 cash. AU the rest were sold at proportionate prices, so far as we can ascertain. In Lynchburg, last week, the foUowing sales were effected:-Man, 23 years old, $1,315; man, 49 years old. $1,360- woman, 20 years old, and child, $1,140 ; man, 21 years old, $1,110; woman, 21 years, and two children, $i1,380; woman,20years,andonechild, $1,260; woman, 19 years old, and one child, $1,040; man, 38 years, $1,300 - girl,17 years,$1,190; boy, 19 yearsold, $1,025. In all 30 slaves were sold, and the average of old and young, including several children in arms, reached the very high figure of $708. The Charlottesville Advocteesays, ' There was a very large number of negroes sold publicly on last Monday, our last January court day. Probbly as many as a hundred, belonging to different owners, changed masters that day. The prices which they brought were very high ranging from $1,000 to $L300 for men, and $ t $900 for women." A sale of 10 negroes, rangig in age from 10 to 70 years, were made in Liberty, Bedford county, on Nev Year's day, for the agregate so m of $7,637. The highest price obtained was $1,2ou; the lowest, $140-average $763 70c. This is doing pretty well, considering the almost superannuatedconditionof several of the negroes. In Winsborough, South Carolina, on the 5th inst., the sales of negroes fuly sastained the high figure t whichthey bave previously ranged. One Drime negro fellow sold for $1,340,a credit of 2 months. We notice in the Colombia Carolinian sales of the same day, by Byteewood and Smitb, that also were in keeping with previous prices. A boy, 20 years old, sold for $1,260; & boy, 19 years old, for $t,250. 11 negroes confined in Harris Edmondson's gaol, Virginia, and awaiting transportation south, escped from confinement on Saturday night, and have not since been heard of. The police having been notified there is but little doubt but that the runawas will soon be apprehended. A negro named Beverly, slave of Mrs. Sarah Crulnp, was tried before the Justices of Newr Eent county.

THE NEnBo ITN'sunFIrxoN.-A Mfr. J. Kingsley supplies the foUlowing communication to the NYew York nti-Stazery Standesd of January 17:-" Hap. pening to have occasion to visit Carter County (Ken. tuciky) last week, I was made the unwilling witness of a scene of barbarity that would have made the bloodthiratv Nero tremble. It seems, from what I afterwards learned, thatthe slaves of one William IMimis, quite an extensive farmer of Carter county, Kentucky, were suspected of being engaged in a conspiracy to rise, upon a certain night, and, in connexionwith the slaves upon an adjoining farm, murder the white people. This report having g ined credence, the slaves were arrested and tried by one of those mock-courts so common in the southern country. One negro, who was supposed to be in the conspir
closely questioned and threatened with severe punishment in case he did not reveal the whole affair. The negro stoutly denied having anything to do with such a
ceeding, disclaimed any knowledge of an insurrection, and begged to be released. But he was doomed to be tortured until he confessed. In order to intimidate the other slaves -it was deemed necessary to 4orturethbis miserable ereature before thoireyes. Accordingly, he was strippedthe weather being cold-and then he received 200 lashes on the bare back. Still the negro swore that he knew nothing about the insurrection. Not yet sautlised, these inhumau' monsters, excited, as it were, the blo6dthey had already drawn, proceeded to tie himu up to a stake with the evident intention of burning him. When told he was next to be burned the screams of the poor creatre ware indeed terrific and heart-rending; but, despite his entreaties and cries, a pilo of dry wood was heaped around him, and asain he wasL tola if he would nstconfess he would be burnod to a crisp; still he refused, when the pilo was lighted, and soon began to blaze around the ictim. Unable longerto witness such unexxampled cruelty, I rode away and made an effort to get *onio neighbours to go and stop the inhuman peooeodinge, but wstold. to ' mind my own business.' I learned afterwards that the negro was so burned that he died next day. Sceneg like this have occurred In this setion of Kentucky before, but the newspapers sttdiously Avoid publisthinan account of them, and they remain unheard dl', unless Some humane puseser-by happens to witness them,"

It ap. peared that the common had been enclosed under an old Eaclos;ure Act, and the well in question was thus rendeedin accesible wfithout crossing the land enclosedL The olain tiff had also caused the well to be blocked up, anid the present aon was brought to recover damages from the defendants for removing the obstruction in the assertion of their right totake water from the welL No o 'oth well had been set out by the commissioners, and, as the act provided that al roads not set out by them should be taken to boextinguished it was arged for the plaintiffthat the old road to the well was extinguished, and, of consequence, that the right to taike water from the well was also gone.
Mr. KlowLxs, QC., and Mr. CixAszy for the defendants, now showed cause against the rule, wrhich was sup ported by Mr. dALL (with whom was Mr. HI Hill, C.)
The COURT decided that the rule ought to be disc arged. The well was not expressly extinguished, nor could it be held to be so haplied, especially as there had been an uninterrupted use of it for 40 years snce the enclosure. The
nestion of the riht of wy wsnot raised. Rule discharged.

This was a rule for judgment nion obstanM veredicto.
The action was brought to recover damages for casting ashes into a watercourse, whereby it was aleged the ashes were carried down the stream, and so obstructed the flow of water to theplaintiff'a mill and choked UD his 4amr
The defendant pleaded that he had enjoyed for more than 20 years the easement of putting the ashes in the river. At the trial the defendant obtained a verdict, but xubsequently the plaintiff obtained a rule for judgment non
dante vereduito, upon two grounds; first, it was contended that the easement pleaded was not a claim to any "' watercourse, or the use of any water," within the 2d section of the 2a and 3d Victoria, c. 71, so as to be establshedbv a 20 years' enjoyment without interruption; and second ,
that the easement pleaded was so unreasonable that it could not be supported m law, inasmuch as it would be destructive Of the rights of the plaintif, the supposed grantor of thenrght.
Mr. H. HILL, Q.C., and Mfr. CLASBY now showed cause against the rule, which was supported by Mr. mrNowixs, Q.C., and M. J. ADnlsoN. The COUBT took time to consider.

Mr. H. Hill, r. Brown, and Mr. Hopwood were counsel for the prosecution; and Mr. Keatig and Mr. Petersdorff for the defendants.
This was an isaue dirwted by the Court of Chancery to try a right of waq leading from Hatton-wall throu h George-yard, to Little Safron-hill. The defendant3, wEo were Roman Catholo priests, had purchased in 1852 a good deal of property, including the portion where the alleged vway ran, of Mr. Cabbell, for the purpose of erectingaRoman Catholic chapel. The way in question had been obstructed by Mr. CabbelL This led to proceedings, and in 1849 a trial came on in the Court of Exchequer, when the right of the publio wns established. In former dayc there was a horse-pond in George-yard, which mnore recently had given way to a horse-trough. The Paving Commissioners had paved the way. After the trial a notice had been given to the defendants, who then made a tunnel of 70 feet in length and 7 feet in width, rsons havlng to descendilfeet. Without a model it is l siisible to give a correct idea of the matter, but it was at bt admitted that the onlv quegtion was the width of the way.
Many witnesses were examned on each side.
The questions put to the jury were these-whether there was a right of way, whether it had been obstructed, and to what extent.
Lord CAMPELU said the decision of the jury would go bask to theCourt of Chancery, and he hoped it wouldeecape from that court in due time.
The jury found there was a right of way, and that there was au obstruction by the steps and the tunnel.

hMr. Serijeant Shee and Mhr. Garth were counsel for the
and Mr. T. Atkinson (in the absence of Sir F. shsvr o he defendant.
This was an action brought to recover an amount of 6B. lOs. for wages and 111. money paid, and for an assault and false imprisonment. The defendant pleaded never indebted, except 64 lOs., which he paid into court, and a justfcation.
The platintiffwas butler to the defendant, who Is Mr. LaunneeloShadwell, tho barrister, of Nottingham-place. The fcts of the case will appear from the following detail ofthe evidence:-
James Parker.-I am the plaintiff, and am in the service of Mx. Marsden Smith. IKy wife and I, in November, 1855, went into the service of the defendant, After we had been there a short time my wife gave warning and went into thc servioe of Mr. Smith. I gave warning on thelst of March. On the lst of April I had 6L lOs. owing mue from the defendant. On the 2d of April I was to leave. When I went into the service I had a chest of plate placed in my hands. It was kept in a cupboard In the pantry at the bottom part of the house. On the 2d of April I took oat the plate to show my master. I counted it over just before the defendant came down. I then found that eight table and six dessert spoons and dx dessert forkm were mimng. When the defendant came down I acquainted him with the fact. I said, "Sir, I find there is a deficiency which I have marked down on the list " and I showed it to him. He commenced looking It over. The defendant then said, "This won't do, there are so many mising nd this in more than the balance of your wvages." I saidi was ery sorry, but I could not account for the mimg articles but I would make all the earch I could. The rest of the plate was then locked up. I made every search, but without success, and I have never been able to ccount for the missing articles. I remained there that dy, nd left in the evening. He said I had nothing to do hut take my boxes away, and should he meet with any of the missine articles he would let me know immediately. I sid I should like to have my wages before I went. He said the missing plate was more than the balance of my wages. I then left, but did not take my boxes. The next dav my wife and I went to the defendant's, and saw him. The defendant said to my wife, "What have you come for?" She said,"rvecometoseemyhusbandrighted." Hesaid "I suppose you've come to frighten me?" She said, No, r've not;-a poor ignorant servant come to frighten a gentleman 1" He said, "Go out of my house " and he opeined the door, and she walked out It was raining very hard, and he said, "You had bett-r come inside " and she came in. He said to me, "Are you agreeable to have your boxes searched?' I said I was. Ie said he could not attend to it to-night ; better come to-morrow. Mywife said, "No; I want the boxes searched, as I want to get the things to rights to go to his ptlace." We then went out and fetched a polheeman from the New-road. We took him to the defendants, and he searched my boxes in the defendant's presence. No plate was found there. The defendant was walldng up and down the passage, and said, " I dare say be's pt nothing there." I said I was very so rthe things could not be found. The defendant said, " What do you intend to do? You have had possession of the chest and the ke V" I said, "- Yes, Sir; and you've another key." He said, "Yes, I have; but what's that to do with It?" The value of the plate is about 171. lOs. I aid I could not account for the plate. He then said, " I must give you into custody." My wife said, "What do you intend to do with mry usbandi" 3He said," Compromise the matter, and it shall be done with" Isaid I wod not condescend to that. The detendant said L'Then you're in charge." We then all went to the policestation in Marylebone-lane. My wife atd I were walking together, but the policeman saidwemust not walk together. The police-station was about three-quarters of a mile from the fendan a house. Thedefendant talked to the liceman. When we got tothe station my wife entreated me to pay the money and get to my place. At last I condescended to do so. I saw the inspector, who mid, "Youare in the handsof your master. What doyou intend to do? Canyou give any account of the mising plate ?" I said I was very sorry Icould not. The defendant sad to the inspoetor "'IHe says I've a key besides himself."1 The inspector sa le"Do you mean to accuse your master of takinfg tepso,
said, "No, certainly not." Then f thr. Shadwell and go he 3eney. The d1eTndantetcame back n an hour and alf and brought my boxes in a cab, and I Wm allowed to go.

Parker remaining in custody. Afterwards the defendant came and said he had received the money, and there was no necessdty for keeping Parker any lorger. I entered this in the chsrge book.:
3Ir. TnisoN, for the defence, regretted the absence of Sir F. Thesiger, who vas engaged in another cout. The whole qustion wouldbethis,-hadthe defendant atthe time he gavetho plaintiff into custody reason to beieve, first, that syelony ha been committed, and, then, that the plaintiff had committed that felony? He then contended that from -the frts the defendant was justflied in coming to those con-
lusion., He should, however, alter the circumstances by the evidence ofthe defendantand the policeman whoearched the boxes. The learned counsel then caled the foUowing witnesses:-
Mr. L Shadwe1L-On November 6, ISS5, the plaintiff and- his wife cam'e into my sevice. I delivered to him this list of plate. On the 1st of April, 1856,Isaw the list again. ThepItintiff being about to leave my ervice 'It was necessary I should go over the list with him. I went down into the pantry for that purpose that afternoon. The pLSantiff had set out the plate on a table, and he then ¢elivered to me my list. lhe figures 42, 36, and 34 were added to the list, and the ink was then dr upon the paper The plaintiff made no observation on delvering the "ltto me. I asked him what was the meaning of those three figues, pointing to them ? He first endeavoured to out.ace me, and said those figures expressed the true quantities of plate he had received. I said " What's themeaning of 42? jHe said there were only 42. I said there ouglt to be 50 large forks. He said " No he had received only 42. I satd there ought to be 42 dessert forks; he said he had received only 36. I said there ought to be 40 tablespoons; he said he had only received 34. After that I looked over the rest of the silver,and found,with those exceptions, thereat of the plate ws there. I had with me another list of the plate, -that made me certain of the quantity. Only things of a peculiar pattem were missing. Ipointed outthat fact to the *plaintiff,who afterwards recollected it,and said it was part of that which we neverused,and which lay atthe bottom of the plate-chest. I took possesion of the plate. They were aood locks; there had been no violence. I had a dunlicate key, which I kept under lock and key. IthensaId to the plaintig " This is a very unpleasant affar. I can't think of paing you.the balance of your wages until you deliverup the plate." The plaintiff said "That is just." Isald, mow wishyouwould take awayyour boxes and g" He remained -at my house till nearly 10 o'clock that evening and then he went away, leaving I is boxes behind. On the followin morning he called and asked ifI had found the plate.
told hima I had not, and he went away. On the 3d oF Ail when I came home, I found the plaintiff and hls wife in my house. I asked what they came for. He said he wishedme to settle with him. I said if he would restore the platethat was missing I would pay bim the arrears of his we, ge uaid hewasnot prepared to do so. I said I shoildlEketo have his boxes searched by a police-constable. The plaintiff and his wife then went out, and returned wth a constable. The boxes were opened by the plaintiff, and he polieman searchtd them. No plate was found I then told the
stable I charged the plaintiff with making aa with my plate. We all went to the polce-statlon On
way the plaintiffs wife cried and said, "Think of my child." We got to the station, and I delivered the charge to the inspector. The plaintiff ued some
prossions like these.-Will you allow me to settle the matter with you?" I refused to Elten to it, andlsaid, t" o Iwilnot." At the station the wife asked me to accept stis faction for the misdsg plate. I said, if 111. were paid to me that evening I would not prees the criminal charge, and in the course of the evening the money was paid to me by the wife, and I then took the plaintiff's boxes to the station, and stated that I should not proceed with the charge,andthe plaintiffwas release,Iwihedtoget him and his boxes out of my house. I adi not ay, "Pay me the value of the plate and Ill compromise It in that wa." I did not use the word " comnpromise." At the time I te lieved the plaintiff had comnmitted afelon

Wtness,-Yes, I did.. The plaintiff had said that Elim. beth might have known something about it.
Croas6 eramned.-You took: a lenient view of it when you saw the money. Do you mean you believed he was guilty of a felony?
Witness.-I must answer that in my own way
Lord CATBXLL.-No, you must answer it drectl.
Witness.-The conviction arose in my mind that he had stolen the plate when he came to demand his wages in an insolent manner.
Cross-examination continued.-When did you first be. lieve that he was guilty of felony ?-On the 2d of April I had consulted the inspector. I am certain he stole the plate now, and I was quite certin when I took the money. I believed him to be a felon. I gave him a character.
Account to the jury why yoU took the money of a felon whom you knew to be going intoa respectable place ?-I said " You must either have stolen the plate or-have lost it." At first I was disposed to think he had lost it; but when he offered to pay that altered the case. I was first tken aback. On the 2d of Aprll I believed, and now blieve, that he stole the plate. Idid not mean to say that his payment altered the case. The locks have always been in order. I never tried them during the whole time Parker was in my service. He endeavoured to persnade me that the plate he produced was all the plate I had delivered to him.
Re-examined.-I wrote to the plaintiff's master.
The case was here adjourned till to-morrow morning.
WxDzzsrDAY, FEB. 4.
(Sittings at Nifsi Prims, before Lo-d CAMPBELL and a
Special Jury.)
PABKER V. SHADWELL,
Mr. Serijeant Shee and Mr. Garth appeared for the plain. tiff; Mr. Tindal Atkinson and Mr. C. Maaney Smithfor the defendant.
At the sitting of the Court this morning,
Mr. TnromAL A:Tx-sox summed up the defendanVs evidence, And contended that he had acted throughout bondjide, and under the reasonable belief that the plaintiff had committed the felony. He also contended that if the defendant believed the plaintiff had committed a felony, and the plaintiff knew he had done so, the parties wvere inpari deicto, and the plaintiff could not recover the i11.
Mr. Serjeant Snus, in reply, said, he regrettedthat a gentleman in the position of the defendant should have made such a mistake as he had done, and he contended from the evidence that there was no ground for believi that the plaintiff bad been guilty of any felony, or th_t the defendant had any such belief.
Lord C0,%ir:erLL, in summing up the evidenoce, said that if the defendant's plea was proved it would be an answer to the action for the false imprlsonment; for if the defendant bond jidc belived that the plaintiff had stolen his plate, ho was justified in giving him Into custody. His lordship then read over the whole of the evidence, and left several questions to the jury, ihe chief of which was, whether the defendant when he gave the plaintiff in charge believed that the plaintiff had committed felony This question the jUry answered in the *frmatlve, and they added their beliet that the defendant gave the plaintiff in charge with the intention of prosecuting him.
Lord CK~alPBXnL then directed the verdict to be entered for the defendant on the count for the false imprisonment
In answer to other questions, the juryfound thatthe plaintiff paid the HI. to get rid of the criadnal charge, bu that it was not proved to their atisfaction that hs was guilty, and they accordingly said he was not guilty of the elony. JUpon this finding,
Lord C.,I5'BELL dir=eted the verdict to be entered for the defendant upon the money count, giving t the plaintiff leave to move to enter the verdict in his favour for al.
HARRLSo0 V. TE MAlQtUS OF B&TH.
Mr. It. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. M T. Cole, were for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Milward, for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Adolphus Harrison, sued the Marquis of Bath to recover the sum of 78&, which he claimed to be due to him for wine supplied and services rendered to the defendant in the years 1863 and 1854. The defendant pleaded the general issue.
Mr. AL CHAMBERs. in opening the case, said he felt deep regret that he was obliged to state the circumstances out of which the plaintif's demand arose. The action was brought to recover the sum of 78L, which the defendant owed the plaintiff for wine supplied in the years 1853 aid 1854 upon the order and upon the credi; of the defendaut. At that time the plaintiff was living in Pimlico and carry. ing on business as a wine agent and merchant. He w..s then in the habit of visiting at the house of a Madame Denis, aud the wine was supplied at her house on distinct orders given by the defendant. It would appear that the farquis of Bath and other noblemen and gentlemen of the
first quality were in the habit of vsiting 3fadame Denis; but after some time the house was suppressed, and an indictment preferred against Harrison, Madame Denis, and another, for conspiring to bring over to this country young girls for purposes which the jury might imagine. dame Denis fled to the continent, but the plaintiff (Harrison) was convicted, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment with hard labour. After his release from prison Harrison made his claim against the Marquis of Bath, and received r. on account, and at the same interview handed over to the marquis two lettes which the marquis had some time pre. xiously written to Madame Denis. The plaintiff Harrison would-be aled as awitne, and, he would prove that the orders forthe wine were given by the marquis himself, but as he had not been able to obtain payment he was oblged to bring the present action. The defendant had not pleaded, as he might have done, that the contract was immoral, and.
that the plaintiff knew that the goods were supplied for an immoral purpose. The plaintiff would be obliged to admit' that be had been found guilty of a crinlal offence, and he would no doubt be exposed to rigid troqssexaminatiOn He h ad, indeed, been- ruined b -the prosecution, but that w's no rDOn why he should not call on those who were iladebted to him for pwyment.
Adolhus Harri4on ma then examIined by Mr. COLE - esair6-I am thre plaintiffin this action, I 1852 I lived inTachabmok-street PimUlico. I carriedon tho buinensoe a wine agent.

I have carged 10i. for that. I had sveraleabs. In 1854 I received orders from the defendant for four dozen nore wine. It was not always from the defendant per. sonaly; sometimes from Madama Denis, who sa. in the defendants presence, "His Lordship wants four dozen of wine." It was to bo port and chanpagne. I am not poeitive About the port. The s*ms charged are fair and reasonable. I was for some time in prison, under sentenoo of a court of justice. After I came out I saw the defendant at 44,
rleeley-.uxare. He gave me 5M He acked ne where Madame Deiis was? I said she was in Switzerland, and that she had forwarded to me two of his lordship's letters. I had the letters with me, and handed themtD his lordshi I said I had called upon him for my claim for the wine. i
lordship said he was certain I was ill-treated, and asked ne whatwas the amount. 1 toldhin the amount was 781., and that I thought I was entitled to three times the amount, from the loss I had experienced and the heavy expenses of my trial. The defendant said he would think it over, and I might call on him in about three weeks. He on that occasion gave me 1U. Nothing more passed before I left.
Crossexamined by Mr. JAMES.-My name is Adolphus Harrison FeistelL I caU maself a wine merchant. I dropped tho namLe of FeiteU eight, nino, or ten yeArs ago My mother is alive, and pas by the name of FeistelL I was arrested on this charge on the 22d of February, 1854, on a charge of entrapping a Belgian girl Into this house. She went Ty the name of Alice Leroy. I was tried in A r4 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment with hard labour. I came out on the Ist of Apzil, 1856. I was tried at the Central Criminal Court. This is my handwriting The paper wAs read. It was headed:-"A Harrison, of Denis and Co., 3, Denbigh-terrac Pimlico," and puroted to be an account of wine consumed at the house ofu"iI D. by his lordship's personal order." I was not In partner. shi p th L Denis. MIy partner was in Montevideo. I expain tho beading by saying it does not refer to Madame Denis, but to a man who lived with her named If. Denis. I have known Madame Denis since 1850. She then lived in Stafford-place. I was not present when she was arrested there in 1850 for keeping a brothel, when Serjeant Loom arrested her. I knew her the day after her trial at Clerkenwell. The ebamgxpZ wrassup.p1ied from the dooks on warrants, as

I opened the door a few times accidentally. (The witness was then cross-examined on the particulars of hisdemand, which, among other items, contained oneunder the date of May and. June, 1854, for attendance on the de. fendant, and. carrying letters to various ladies, for which he chaed 104) The plaintiff said, in May and June, 1854, I was n prlson. aThe particulars charged for two dozen of champagne suplied in July, 1854.) The witnes said, I was Ia prison in July, 185, but it was ordered in January. I w swear that. I will swear I saw the defendant at the house in Ootober, 1853. To the best of my% belief he was there. I could almost swear I saw him there in January, 1854 The July, 1854, is a- mistake. I swear that in January or February an order vwas given by the defenuant for wine. I wll not swear it wAs given personally. The defendant was presenut when Madame Denis gave me the order. He came on horsebsck. I was not in the habit of delivering letters to gentlemen at different clubs. I delivered two letters In December, 1853, about the middle of the month, the defendant sent me to Paris with letters. I caled on the deI fondant in July last year. I took some letters Lord Bath had written to madame Denis. I first saw the valet. He offered me something in his hand like that and said "His lordship sends you that." I will not swear that I saw the colour of It. I said I required to see his lordship.

I swear I saw the Duke of Cambridge at 3, Denbigh-terrace, Pimlico. I swear the Duke of Cambridge gave orders for the wine. He said he was the Duke of Cambridge to Madame Denis. I saw the Du-e of Cambridge on the bench this morning. I will not swear that was tho gentleman. I will swear Lord Somerton (who stood up in court) was at F Madame Den&s. His was only a slight order. I have
brought an action aginst him for wine. I can't swear to the date at all. I had some books. I believe they were seized by the police, stolen, or something,-letters and aU. This is the inspector who arrested me. I had a pocketbook taken from me, which was returned to me. I had a ledger entr.-boolr, a cashbook, and a bankbook at the Royal intoish Bandt (Loud laughter.) My house was broken into, and th books were taken. They were kept at 3, Deniigh.terrace. I had dissolved partnership with Jackson and Harrison eight months before. The instector said he had only taken the pocketbook from me. I have written to several noblemen and gentlemen for wine. I have written to perhaps a dozen. I instructed Barry to write. I thought ne was a soUcitor. These applications were all for wine suppliod at Denbigh-terrace. I authorized Barry to write, but Idid not see the letters.

Mr. Barry has got the visiting-book, and I believe he Is paid by their lordships to get out of the way. I saw the hooka month ago in the possession of Barry. (Hlis Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge here again entered the court and took his at on the bench.) If it was not his lordship (the Duke of Cambridge) who was there, he had exactly the same features. His lordship gave me orders for wine.
Be-ex mined by Mr. CnAmBus.-I never saw Barrys letter after he had written it. I had the visiting-book and Favo it to Barry. When I came out of prison I foand the book among some letters in a carpetbag in a lumber room. I said "' Here is the visiting-book of those noblemen." They al promised me a Government situation (loud laughter) if I said nothing.
Lord CAfPREnr.-What situation did they offer you ? The witness said it was in one of the islands.
xr. J.A.S sug gested Norfolk Island.
Lord CAxrnsxLL.-Was it Norfolk Island 2
The witness answered indistinctly, and we understood him to say Nova Scotia, near Montevideo. I was at 16, Tachbrook-street when I was taken up on this charge. I was of the firm of Jackson, Harrison, and Co., U, New Broad-street, city. We were merchants and foreign agents. When we dissolved partnership I had some of the books. I took them to Madame Denis, because I had no room at my apartments. Madame Denis left the country. When I was taken into custody I left all my book at Madame Denis's. I got my pocketbook and walking-stick back, but nothing else. I must have put down May, June, and July, 1854, by mistake. I meant 1853. I have seen the defendant drinldng wine in the drawing-room. I concluded he drank it. He used to give notice when he was coming, and rs Denis used to let me know.
This was the plaintiffs case.
Mr. EDVl,d J&sis then addressed the jury for the defendant, and in so doing said, that whatever faults or vices the Mfarquis of Bath might havo been guilty of, he had felt it to be his duty to defend the present action, in order to resist the extortion which the plaantiff was attemptin not only against the marquis, but against several other noblemen whom he had sued. It was not to be denied that the marquis had been induced to visit the establishment kept by Madame Denis; but, though ho had done so, he would come into the box, and deny that he had ever given a single order to the plaintiff Harrison. He would distinctly contradict the plaintiff upon his eath. It was true that the marquis had several times seen the plaintiff there, and on one occasion he gave him a sovereign, but, beyond that, he had never had anything to do with him. After he (the plaintiff) had come out of prison, he made this claim, and was not satisfied with that7 but he had given instractions to a man named Berry to write to several noblemen and Ientlemen malking similar demands. One of them, Lord lomerton, was now in court, and was prepared to swear that he had never once been in the house of Madame Denis. He went so far as to instruct his attorney._Mr.
Barrow, to wr'te a letter to hisa Royal Highness the Dake of Cambridge making a simiilar demandi for 841. Gs. For that demand there was not the smallest pretence, and his Royal Highness had never been near the house. The learned. counSel then commented upon the contradictions in the plaintiff 's evidence, and referred to the particulars in which he charged the defendant with wine sup plied. and services rendered during the months of May and June, 1854, while ho (the plainitift) was actually at that time in prison uxndergoinug his, sentence. As soon as he (the plaintiff) found out the. difficulty he haa got in he endeavoured to extricate himself by shifting the date. But it would. be clearly proved that during the whole of the time meeationed in the atiulars the marquis was abroad.

The learned counsel then commented upon the letter which the plaintiff had got Barr to write to the marquis, sua argued that, from the false suggestons which it contained, he (the pILintilf) was in the posession of letfters and papers which would support his clam - it mmo a manifest attempt at extortion. The maarquis felt it to belhiis duty to expose the deeplly lai'd scemere of. the plaintiff, and the DuLke of Cambridge also had come into court to lend his assist7ance in :defeating and. exposinIt

a Special rurv.1
Sir P. Theslger Mr Wildo, and Mr Cleasby were counsel for the Crown; lir. Overend appeared for Goldring; Mr. Ribton defended Moornon.
This was an information char'ing the defendants with having been coneerned in iUegaU lluding a quantity of tubs containing 288 gallons of geneva and brandy at Portsmnouth on the 31st of August, 185. The case on the part of the Crown mainly rested onthe evidence of two accomplices in the traneactiop in question, named Skedden and Coleman, corroborated as their story was by the evidence of the son of the latter, and that of an old " salt," named Farrington, who openly rofessed himself to have been a smunz3er almost all his Mife. The defendant Moormon is a pubican, keeping the White Horse, at Portsmouth, and Goldring is a fisherman, residing at Milton, near that town, and, according to the evidence of the two principal witnesses, it appeared that being engaged as fisherman, dredaing for oysters, in the Rambler, a small logger of 16 tons' bunden they were inTited on the 9th of Augast, 1855, by Goldring, "to do some business " (otherwise smuggling), in consequence of N llich they all met at Moormon's who supplied them with a bag of money, wherewith they were to purchase spirits in France. Thus armed,. Goldring proceeded to sea with Skedden and the two Colemans, father and son, ostensibly on a dredging voyage, but really bound for Fdcamp, in the vicinity of lIavre, where they took on board the spirits in question during tho abaence of the boy, who had been sent away in order that he might not know what was going on, but who returned unexpectedly, *nd saw the tubs on the deck, when the, crew drove him away again by throwing stones at hinm. When the whole cargo was stowed asway under a mrface of oysters and stones the Rambler set sail for Portsmoutb, leaving Goldring and the boy Coleman to return, which they did by a steamer. On the 31st of August the vessel entered Portsmouth harbour, and passed safely through the ordeal of a visit fron an officer, who alUoved her to proceea, and at 9o'clock thbt night her cargo was placed in boats and eventually carried away in the presence of Moormon in two or three cabs, but not until, as the accompliees alleged, they had biinded the eTes of a second officer by the application of a little. "golden ointment," which was deducted froni their stipulated pay of 1I. per tub landed. In addition to this outline of the coirpos delicti, the andient smuggier, Farrington, proved that some time after its occ4rrence Moormon told him that he had " worked some things " in the Rambler, pecifying 72 tubs, and asled whether he would enter into a simnilar transaction.
Mr. Ov nmw and 3r. RIBToX having addressedthe jury for their respective clients, eontendinz that the evidence of the two accomplices hbad not received such corroboration as to warrant the jury in gving credit to them,
Sir . TEsioxmr replied on tho whole case
The Cmxi BA-RoN, in umnming up the caem, left it to the jury to say whether they were satisfied that there had been any such illegal transaction as that which had been deposed to by Skedden and Coleman, and, if a, whether they were satisfied tht the two defend&nis aew0N ved in it. The solution of both these questions depend6S O'pon the degree of credit to be given to the tvidenoe of the twd accomplices, and the extent to whi.h they had been oltroc borated by untainted witneF9e. If a criminal charge is dependent upon the evidence of one eocomph'oe. thei,e wai DO doubt that jczdgesanmt iurleg beth 5g5m in declining to act upon that evidenoee uAIem corroborated directly; but it rniht bethat the evidence oftwsIo accomplices would re: quire let. direct confirmation, asnd so on witha more, till the' evidence muight, from the num:ber of accomplices, be a'q overwhelming as to carry conviction along with it, Rere

The ury retired to conider, and ultimately returned a verdict for the Crown against both defendants, the single value of the spirits being taken to be 3221.

THE ATrORNEY.GENERAL V. COLLINS.
The Solicitor-Geaeral, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. Beavan ap. eared for the Crown; Mr. Doyle was counsel for the de;endant . !A
* This was WInformation to recover a penalty of 300. from the defendant, who carries on the business of 3 malt. }oater in Iambeth, for having in his possession a quantity of raw and unmalted corn and grain, in contravention of the statutes of the 6th of Victoria, chap. 30, and of the 20th of Victoria, chap. 334, sec. 19. It appears that the defendAnt is a young man who began business as a malt-roaster on the 13th of August last in Broad-street, Lambeth, and that on the 30th of that month a seizure was made on his pre. Xaises of 404 bushels of roasted grain by two surveyorsgeneral of Excise, on the ground that they had never been mnalted, and were, in fact, raw barley which hadnever germinated.
During the case for the Crown Mr. Goodwin, the Excise officer who had the supervision of the defendant's premises, was called, and he stated that he had examined au the corn which had been roasted by the defendant, as well as the quantity seized, and that, in his opinion and judgment, the whole vas duly malted. Other witnesses, however, for the Crown, including hIr. Phillips, the chymist to the Excise, and Dr. Linley, Professor of Botany at University College, London, deposed to the fact that, in their opinion, the grain in question had not been malted as required by the law. For
e defendant, his foreman, named Cole, swore that all the corn roasted by the defendant, including that seized, was "malted" according to his judgment, and that after grain was roasted it was dffAicult, if not impossible, to say whether it had been malted or not. In addition to this, Mr. O'Brien, another malt-roaster, who was the defendant in another information for a similar offence, proved that, with a view to his own case, he had bought four bushels of the best malt and had made experiments thereon for the purpose of ascer. la-ng whether the process of roasting adopted by him had be effect of entirely obliterating the proof of germination, and that it was impossible to say whether roasted grain was made of malted or unmalted grain. The samples arising from these experiments were produced, and identified by Mr. O'Brien and several others who had witnessed the experiments, as proving the case of the defendant. On =ross-examination of 3Mr. O'Brien it was elicited that he laad bought thte malt on which he experimented from his brother; that he dealt with a inaltster named Lawless generally, whose name was entered by the defendant also in #e book kept by him as required by the statute, and that on one occasion Lawless had furnished him with a quantity of illeglgrainmixed with malt, which was seized after he (O'Brien) had given him notice to take it back, and after it had been plceaby O'Brien temporarily in seme stables occupied by nis (O'Brien's) brother, which stables formed part of the premises on which he carried on his business as
aoater of malto. GEszsA seply,recalledbr.Phillipsand
. Linley, who both positivelysworethattheprocessof roasting malt did not, and could not, entirely obliterate the proofs %of germination; that, unless the grain were quite blackened, it was very easy to detect whether the roasted grain had been malted as required by law or not; and, finally, that the grains in the samples of roasted corn produced by fr. O'Bien had certainly never germinated.
Mr. DoYns having addressed the jury on this evidence,
The SOLICITOP-GENERAL briefly replied on the whole case, stigmatir g the evidence and experiments of Mr. OBrien as fraudulent and concocted with a view to his own defence, ind commenting on the significant fact that the defendant had never dared to call his maltster, Mr. Lawless, toprove that the grain supplied to the defendant had been
The Cnr BARUox;, having summed up, left it to the jury to say whether, in point of fact, the grain seized in the possesion of the defendant was unmalted. If so, the verdict ought to be for the Crown, as the act constituted even the 4nnocent possession of such grain an offence in the case of a 4nalt-royater.
The jury At once found a verdict for the Crown.

The jury who were locked up on the previous night on account of their not being able to agree upon their verdict in the case of Abraham Missenden were this morning again brought into court.
A jury in a criminal case, in the present state of the law, are not allowed to have any refreshment or fire, with the exception of candle light, but with a Tiew to remedy as far as was practicable the inconvenience to which they must necessarily be subjected by being confmed in such inclement weather without any necessary comforts, Mr. UnderSheriff Crosley, with the sanction of the Court, directed that the jury should be placed in the dming-room, in which there had been two large fires the whole of the evening, anda reat number of lamps were also placed in it, and this to scme extent increased the temperature. The jurvmen earnestly entreated to be allowed to have some refiresment, but they were informed that the law was inexorable and that the Court could not legaly ent their request. In order, however, to prevent the farnulies of the Jurymen from suffering any unensiness, a messen ger was despatched in a cab to their residences, to inform their relatives of the circumstances under which they were prevented from returning home.

They replied that they had not.
The RECORDER then inquired whether there was any reasonable probability of their agreeing in a short time.
The foreman, in an emphatio manner, said there was not the slightest chance of their agreeing.
Mr. Folding, a surgeon in Bridge-street, was then sworn, and he stated that he had visited the jury that morning, and he was of opinion that it would endanger the life of one of them if he was kept any longer without nourishment.
The REcORDER said that upon this statement he felt himself justified in discharging the jury without giving a verdict, aAd, taking into consideration the inconvenience they had experienced, he should relieve them from all further attendance at the present session.
Mr. Ro:ewsoN having intimated his intention to try the risoner again by another jury, an application was made by jir. Ribtou, his counsel, for the trial to stand over to the next session, and it was arranged that this should be done, anOd inthLe meantime the prisoner was allowed to be at large
John Bryan, 28, a well-dressed man, described as a cutler. was indicted for misdemeanour.
Mr. Metealfe prosecuted; Mr. Robinson and hir. F. H. lAwis were counsel for the defendant.
It appeared that the offence imputed to the defendant was that of having by a very ingenious fraud plundered the pawnbrokers o the metropolis to a very large amount. The course of proceeding he adopted was this :-He was in the habit of driving in a dogeart to the shop of a pawnbroker and requesting to have a loan upon the deposit of plated goods, consisting of forks, spoons, and articles of that description, and he at the same time represented himself as being the manufacturer of the goods at Sheffield, and he described them as being of very superior quality, and to con. tain quite as much real silver as was contained in those made by Mr. Elkington, who, it appears, is an eminent manufacturer of articles of the same description in the metropolis, and whose goods bear a high character in the trade. It seemed that it was a difficult matter to test articles of this description without destroying their value, and solely upon the representations made by the prisoner it appeared that Mr. Attenborough, a pawnbroker in Newington, advanced him at different times 260ft upon the security of the goods of the description referred to; from a Mr. Cotton, another pawnbroker, he obtained 45L.; and from a third, named Russell, the sum of 601., the goods deposited by the prisoner being, of course, supposed to be of a valuabe description, and on that account to justify the advances that were made upon them. At length it appeared that suspicion was attracted to the defendant's proceedings, and the persons Who had lent the money took the necessary steps to have the articles exanined by competent persons, and it turned out that they were merely covered v;ith the thinnest possible coating of silver, that they were not worth one tenth part so much as the articles fabricated by Mr. Elidngton, that they were, in fact, almost worthless, and, as one of the witnesses stated, the goods were aregular " Brummagem dodge." It also appeared that the defendant did not carry on any businese as a manufactarer at Sheffield, and that he made use of two rooms in a house in Dyer's-buildings, in London, as a receptacle for his goods.
Mr. RoBNisoN made a very ingenious address to the jury on behalf of the defendant, and urged that the circumstances woald not justify them in convicting him of the offence of obtaining money by false pretences, as the defendant had done no more than was done every day by tradesmen of all kinds-namely, givng a greater value to his goods than they deserved. Be also submitted that there had been a great want of caution on the part of the pawnbrokers, who were generally supposed to be prettv sharp on such matters, and to know the value of every article from a toothpick to an anchor, but, he said, it appeared to him that if they had exercised the most moderate caution in the mnatter they could never have been defrauded in the manner they hAd b-een.
The REcosi.En having summed up,
The jury, after some deliberation, returned a special verdict, to the effect that the prisoner had fraudulently obtained the money from the prosecutors by making false representations as to the quality and value of the goods, knowing that they were of less value than he represented them to be; but they were at the same time of opinion that there had been a great want of caution on the part of the persons who advanced the money.
The RECORDER inquired of the jury whether they were of opinion it was made out that the defendant re?resented that the goods he deposited with the pawnbrokers contained as muach silver as those manufactured by Mr. Elkinbgn, and whether the money was advanced partly upon such representation.
The jury said they were of opinion that these facts were established, and
The RECORDER said it appeared to him that upon the finding of the jury a verdict of " Guilty" should be recorded; but, upon the application of Mr. Robinson, he consented to reserve the point for consideration by the Court of Criminal
the defendant was in the meantime admitted to baiL
Mr. METCALFE stated, at the close of the case, that he was instructed that the pawnbrokers of the metro Dlis had been defrauded by similar proceedings to those that were the subject of the indictment to the amount of 10,0001.
John Pinder, 35, was indieted for misdemeanour, in having unlawfully endeavoured to obtain lOs. from Charles Arnold Collins by false pretences.
Mr.d fBodkin prosecuted; Mr. MOubrey was counsel for
The fraud imputed to the defendant in this case was of a somewhat pecular character. It appeared that he was employed as a labourer in the storekeeper's department of the loyal Arsenal at Woolwich, and that he and a great rany other labourers were paid 15s. 2d. every Saturday night as wages, each man receiving a half-sovereign, two halfcrowns, and copper money. It appeared that upon several occeons some of the men had gone back to the clerk who paid them, and represented that he had given them a bad
alf-8Overeign,and upon their produciDg a counterfeit coin he paid them ten shillings out of his own pocket to maake goodI the supposed mistake. This, -very naturally, made the clerk who paid the labourers very careful, and he minutely examined and weighed every coin, so as to prevent the possibility of any counterfeit money being paid. Upon the occasion that was the subject of inquiry tne prisoner was paid as usual, and he shortly afterwards came back to the clerk and produced a counterfeit half-sovereign, and declaredathat he had given it to him, and demanded IOs. in its place. The clerk told him that he was certain hehadnot given him the counterfeit coin, and the prisoner then became very insolent, and was taken into custody, and upon his being searched a genuine half-sovereign, which was, no doubt, the one given to him hy the clerk was found concealed in his boot.
The jury found he defendsnt tilty, and he was sentenced to SiX montha' hard lsbour.
The grand jury here returned six true bills for forgery and larceny against John Paul, the late collector to the City of London Union.
Mr. ORRIDGO applied to the learned Recorder to fix the trial for Thursday. He said that Serjeant Bellantine was speciall retained with himself to conduct the defence, and it would be convenient for all parties if the case was fixed for that day.
Mr. BODEIN, who is instructed to conduct the prosecu. tion, said he had no objection to this being done, and the trial was appointed accordingly for the day named.
Late on Monday evening Mr. Clark, the clerk of the Central Criminal Court, received a communication from Mr. Baron Martin directing him to make oit an ordbr upon Sir Richard Mayne for the Turkish bonds that were fbnnd in the possession of Pearce, one of the bullion robbers, to be delivered up to 3r.

The prosecutrix, it Appeared, was a domestic servant, a respectable young girl 15 years old, and at the time the occ currence took place she had left a situation about a week. On the afternoon of the 9th of December she was walking acroes a place called Wise's.fields, near Notting-hill, about 3 o'clock, when ohe met a man in the dress of a sweeps and inquired of him the way to Sutherland-place, where she was going. He gave her a directiUoand she walked on, and almost immediately afterwards the man came up with her, and, after making use of some disgusting expressions, knocked her down, and committed the offence charged in the indictment, under circumstances of great atrocity and violence. The man, wlhoever he was, then ran off; and the prisoner was not taken into custody until five or six days afterwards, and it appeared that upon seeing the prosecutrix with the police-constable coming towards bim he ran away. The prosecutrix, it appeared, had described the appearance of the man who committed the outrage upon her to the policeman, and, notwithstanding the manner in which he was disguisedbythesootthatwasabuthis person,sheteiinapositive manner that he was the man who committed the offence; and in confirmation of her statement in this ptrticular, ft appeared that during the scuffle she bi the mrn who wa attacking her on the hand, and there was the mark, apparently arising from nch an injury ls a bite, foun;d upon the knucke of one of the hands of the P-isoner wher he was taken into custody.

John Plumley, o0, was indicted foruttering a forged 51.- note,
Mr. Giffard and Mr. Bayley conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Bank of England. The prisoner had no c-ounsel.
This charge was clearly established against this prisoner. It appeared that he had given two forged 51.-notes to a man named Longden, who was at the time employed as a waiter at the Flora-gardens, Camberwell, to get changed for him, and he receivea the money, It appeared that Longden was subsequently tried in this court for havingpassed the notes in queston, but his defence, that he had merely acted as the innocent agent of another person in passing the forged notes, was believed by the jury and he was acquitted. This man was now examined as a witness, and he swore that he re. ceived the two notes from the prisoner to get changed, sad in addition to this, it was proved that the prisoner had passed four other forged 51.-notes; it also appeared that he eventually absconded, and was apprehended at Sheerness by Sergeant Coppin, of the P division of police. He was then told that he was charged with passings dx forged 51.-notes, and he replied, " Quite right -" and at the same time told the officer that he would give Lim some information that would be useful to him, but he would not teU him what It was at that time, and on the folowing morning he said he had received some of the forged notes from a man named "Jemmy Musty," who was transported for life at this court a short time back for a garotte robbery.
The prisoner, when called upon for his defence, said that had received the notes in payment of a debt that was due
The jury, without any hesitation, retumed a verdict of Guilty, and the prsoner was sentenced by Mr. Baron Bram. well to be kept In penal servitude for six years.
J'ames Barber, 35,a respectable-lookdng man, described as a clerk, pleaded " Guiltto an indictment which charged him with forging a deed, and to three others which charged him with stealing and embezzling money, the property of his master, Edward Kelly Harrns.
Mr. Lilley was counsel for the prosecution.
The prisoner made a most earnest appeal to the Court for mercy, and said that he had a wife and two children dependent upon him, and he had been driven to commit these offences by pecuniary pressure. He received 21. a-week salary, and he had no complaint whatever to make against his employer, but he said that having imprudently gven a bill he was unable to meet it, and, being pressed, he had unhajpily committed those offencesto gethim-elf out of bis difficulties.
Mr. Harris, the prosecutor, said that, as he had ascertained that the prisoner had committed several very grave offences, he felt that he had no alternative but to come forward to prosecute; at the same time he had no vindictive feeln
against the prisoner, and hoped that the Court would del with him as mercifully as possible.

r. Lilley prosecuted; Mr. Metealfe aLnd Mr. Philipps
The circumstances of the case were somewhat peculiar. The woman Chandler had for many years lived with the prosecutor, a German tailor, named Frederick Fisdorf, as
wife, and they occupied a house in Westbourne-parkterrce, and had done so for about two years. In November last Fisdorf gave to the prisoner Chandler 10 O 10s. to pay the quarter's rent to Mr. Mead, the landlord, and she gave to him (Finsdorf) what appeared to be a receipt for the rent, signed by Mr. Mead. On the 23d of last month Mr. Mead called for a half-yeas rent, and, upon the prosecutor producing the receipt in question, found that it was a
4orgery. Frosecutor then went to the prisoner Paris, who is the forewoman to a large dyer in that neighbourhood, and upon speaking to her about the document she admitted baving written the receipt for Chandler, who told her that she meant to make up the money she was then about to muce for another purpose before any inquiry was made about it, and get a proper reedipt. Upon the same day Chandler left her home and sent a oetter to prosecutor, in which she said, that having got into debt for housekeeping she had used that money to clear hterself, hoping to replace It, but had got further into debt.
In cross-examination prosecutor said he worked with Messrs. Poole and Co., of Saville-row, and his earnigs ranged from 1lL to 2-. a-week. Chandler always pa6sed as hiswif- tey ad ivd s fo 15yeas.They let lodgings, and he aloweJd hedr Jia-week lto ke lethouse.

WzsTXMsrM-Edward Simms, ali4a Mallin, and WVillam Paton. two well-dressed feUows, the former of whom bl lost a leg and walks with a crmteh, were yesterday charged with the following impudent robbery :-
Mr. Bannister, a gentleman residingat 63, Coleshill-streot, Pimlico, Sid, that being iformed by his servant that two persons waited to see him in the hall, he went down, and found the prisoners in his dining-room, into which they had intruded themselves. One of the fellows had thrown himself on the couch, and the other was comfortably warming bimself by the fire. On Mr. Bannister's entrance Paton walked up to him, and, extending his hand, said, " How do you do ' Mr. Bannister, taken by surprise, gave his hand, but in the next moment intimated that his visitor had the advantage of him, and inquired who he was. Paton affebed sulrprise at his not knowing him, and said that he wanted him to do something for his friend (hllin). Mr. Bannister inquired what he could do, whenthey replied theydidn't want money, they merely wanted sympathy, which Mr. Bannister expressed his willingness to bestow upon the lame man, who was stated to
have lost his login the Crimea. One o the fellows then solcited a private interview, which Mr. Bannister, who hadrecoveredfrom his first surprise, refused, and after some further conversation they left. Mr. Bannister, whose only solution of the inexplicable visit of the felows ws that they must have come with an intention to rob the house, looked round directly they vere gone, and missed his silver spectacles. He followed the fellows, and seized them, when the spectacles were found on the ground near thema.
Sergeant Loom, a detective officer, recognized the prisoners as two of a notorious gang, One of them had been twice in custody, and, as many robberies had of late been coinmittedby1 men of their description forcing their way into houses, he solicited a remand.
They were remanded till Tuesday.

WOsEarP-s.TE.-On Mr. D'EYNcoOURT taldng his seat on Tuesday he ws greatly surprised at bearing from Hayward, the warrant-offlicer, that though 38 out of 60 men who had attended on the day before to complain of distress had been found in possession of tickets for work, and had each on that ground taken the magistrate's shilling, only Ulor 12 of them had gone to the stoneyard to work, bat that amnong the few who did go was, to his great credit, the chiefspokesman of the previous evening. The magistrate evidently felt much disappointed, and in the course of the day he visitoa the workhouse, to judge for himself.
Yesterday Charles Montroe, a, man of notorious charactr, before convicted, was charged with robbing Mr. Thomas
Smith, a tradesman in Barbican, of his watch, and also ofe Massults.
Greenfield, of the G division, deposed to hearing cries of Stop thief," and finding the prisoner held by the prosecutor and another person, he took him in charge, and the prisoner kieked him on the thigh, knocked him down with a blow on the eye, and got away, but was pursued by a gentleman and the witness, who ain seied him, but was again kicked and struck by the prisoner, and both fell, the prisoner repeatedly klcing him until abrower's drayman came up to his assistance, when the prisoner, who is a powerfnlly-built fellow, was at length overpowered with

The prisoner had no answer to the charge, and he was ordered to be committed for the completion of the depositions.
CLTRREN'W.L.-Long beforo the commencement of business on Tuesday morning the front of the court was besieged byworkmen, and as soon as the court was opened it was
ied toexcess by respectable-looking men in the dress of bricklays, lasteres, 'aters, &., one of whom, named Henry auntr handed to Wiz. CoP.Rig the following note

Mr. Coneah said,-I have reads are rtof a meeting held in Smithfield yesterday, at whichf hwat s ryto ob serve that much foolish and violent language was used. I have communicated with the parish offucr of St. Pancras and Islington and they wil find work for you all,and in

Mr. Consaix said that be could not diotate to the parish authorities as to the particular work to be given to the men, but that if a respectful letter were written to the directors of the poor, in any particular case where the applicant, from his previous habits of life or from constitutional debility, really could not break stones, some other kind of work woud probably be found. The time just now, owing to the state of the weather the difficulty the builders had in DroCanD money, and other circumstances, were most unavoaravie for workmen, but with a little forbearance on their part, and with a kind administmtion of the law by the parish officers, they would get on until the spring, when there would be plenty of work. Mr. Baylis, the chief usher, would go with them to the parish authorities, and inquiries would bo made into each cas
A deputation of the overseers of the parish of Islington, and consisting of 3tr. Vousley, ?Mr. Cw4ell, and Mr. Holland, ccompanied by Mr. Cooper, attended and stated that up to mid-day the men could earn from Is. to Is. Gd.
Helen Rock, a chambermaid at the Peacock, Islington was yesterday placed at the bar before Ur. CoRit, charged with stealing a number of sheets and other articles of considerable valne, the property of Mr. Charles Liley, the landlord of the Peacock-, and Joseph Rock, the husband of the female prisoner, a brass finisher, residing at 38, Rawstorne-street, Clerkenvell, was charged with receiving the same, wel knowing them to have been stolen.
Mr. Wortner appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. John Wakelingforthe defence.
It appeared from the evidence that the woman had been in the employ of Mr. LSley as chambernmaid, but received no regular wages; all she received was what she got from gentlemen who visited the house. A few days smce Mrs.
iley wanted some articles to use, and, having asked the prisoner for them, shortly afterwards overheard her tell the laundress to go and fetch them out of pawn. Mrs. LIley allowed the woman to go out, and on her return stopped her, and found in her possession the articles she had hut a short time before inqmred for. Inquiries were made. and it wasascertained that many other things had been stolen. The husband was shortly afterwards taken into custody, and upon him was found a duplicate relating to some of Mr. Liley's property. Upon searchingthe prisoners'residence no less t 50 dupicates relating to other stolen property were found, and the pawnbrokers attended with the pledges.
Mr. CORRIE said there was no case against the man, and he would be diswharged.
Mfr. WakeUng said the woman would plead guilty, and he understood that the prosecutor rocommended her to mnercy.
Mr. CORRIE said it was the pawnbrokers who were the suffcrers, and he could therefore take no cognizance of it. He should inflict upon her a very heavy punishment, nd would send her to the House of Correction for six calendar mnonths.

TsssNu.l~merous cases and applications, arising out of the distress which exists among the labouring
cases owing to the want of employment, came uuder the notice of Mr. SZLPZ~ yesterday, wvho relieved somne of the mos urgent, recommended by the clergy of the district, with small sums of money, but he wvas compelled to refuse anyrelief to hundreds, ad said the funds at his disposal were very limited, and he had to repeat for the five hundredth time that a police-court was not a relseving-office, and he could not take upon himself the functions of a relieving oficer; if he did the legitimate business of the court must be entirely stopped. The bearing of applications for relief wras a serious inconvenience to the public who had to attend the court.
At 6 o'clock 31r. SE~y was informed there wvere upwards of 200 men, whose numbers were accumulating every instant, wating for relief.
MWr. SELFg said he could not relieve them or inquire into their cases. They mus apply to the relieving offlcers at the workhouses of the parishes to which they belonged, and who must do their duxty by the poor at this inclement season.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~G,

SoTwuc.-CharlIes Howell, a bricklayer, residingat 1I' Uninplc,Blackfriars-road, was brought before Ar DB6cELa on Tuesday, charged with cruelly using his two children, a lad nine years of age and a girl six years old.
It appeared that the prisoner is living in adultery with another woman, his wife being comrolled, throngh his bad conduct, to go to service. Since then the poor children have been shamefully neglected, and several times thev have been brought to this court by the polioe, being found wandering about the streets in a starving condition, and the pnsoner's excuse was, when sent for, that- the children clandestinely left their home while he was at work. On. Saturday night ast Mary Broadhurst, a woman residing
opposie, saw the prisoner in his room beat the poor chidlren in a most unmerciful mnner. She saw him take up the girl and throw her 'oh the floor adid strike her on the head, from which blood came. The boy he struck an thb bead and body with a soldier's belt ant, seized him by the neck as if to strangle him. Witneis was positive that he intended to murder the chldren, 'which so friightened her that she ran out of the hou and caUed the police, A constable came up, and, having lained. admission into the
hous, they went into the prisoner's room, where they saw blood on the floor and th3 prisoner in the act of wiing it uap. The Chidren'sfaceswereocovered with blooda'ndt
were in a tate ofnudity. (Witness ere put dowa thi
dren's clothing frosa the upper part of their bodies, when a frightful sight Was epsed to view, causing great pensa-
tion in the court. The boy's head waas mnch bruised, his neck scratched, and back covered with marks recentl. causedby a strap. The girl was smilarly bruieed all over,J X The prisoner, in nswer to the charge, said that tboyo
wa a liar as well as a thief, and he asnd biis ister were always leavin home, nd it had taken him nights to find them. His worship mewv very well that le had been compelled to bring the bov before him for theft and other misconduct, and he found it impossible to keep them af home.
Mr. BuxRCsA told him he did not wonder at a boy so T-oung being a thief and a liar when he had such a disgutting father. Whatever he or his sister might do, he (the pnsoner) was not justified in treating them in such a cruet
banner. If they wanted correcting, there was a way to do that without acting with brute force, as it certainly ap; peared that he had done, from the emaciated condition-of the poor children before him He had thought it a case to rend to the sessions for trial, but he found that a recent act of Parliament gave him powerto derl summarily with him. He should therefore sentence him to four months' hard labour at Wandsworth.
George James Thring, a commercial traveller, was charg.d on Tuesday with oormitting an aggravated assault on hix vife. Both the prisoner and his wife are young rersons, and very respectably connected.
The complainant, who exhibited a black eye, stated that she had been married to the prisoner tbree years and a half; and during that time he had been in the habit of illusing her. On Thursdav night last he came home in a violent passion and havmg pulled her out of bed, strucl
heron thahea We also ewid hold of her by the neck and nearly strangled her. Her screams brought assistance, And shemanaged to get out of the house and run to her mother's for protection. On the following morning she came to this court and obtained a warnt for his apprehension.
MIr. BuRnc xM told him that this appeared not to be the first, second, or third time he had illused his wife, and he seemednowtotreatthe wholeaffairvery lightly. He had oAl
been married to this young woman three years and a big and, instead of cherishing her, as he swore to do at the altar ho used her ina brutal manner, sO that atleast three times she had been compelled to leave her home, anda see}
te protection of her mother. Under all the circumstances of tn'e case he should commit him to the House of Correc'
tion for three months with hard labour, and order him to find bail for sax months.
The msgistrate has received a post-offioe order for ll. from " H.," and a sovereign from " W. P.," for the poor. box of this court. It ma n easw ell to state thatinthis
popnlous dstrict, where there are hundreds thrown out of employ owing to the inclemency of the weather, no disturbance has tken place, neither has there been any complaints respecting want of food and fueL This is chiefly caused by the judicious manner in which the fands of the poor-box are disposed of among the deserving poor. There has been 4,000 tic ets for bread and the like number for coals issued by the chief clerk, and di-tributed by the various tradesmen in all
t" of the distet, from Waterloo-bridge to Rotherhithe. ch bread-ticket entitles the holder to 61b. of the best bread, and the coal-ticket to 561b. of coal. There are also a few tickets for coke, the acceptors of wh?ch appear very gratefuL.

A court-martial assembled on Tuesday on board the flagtship Watrloo, C tain Lord Frederick Kerr, to try CaptainJohn Fraser, Lietenant JE Hurt, and Mr. William Jeffery, the Master of the Pembroke, on a charge of having allowed the said ship, while under their respective orders, as commanding officer, officer of the watch, and master, to strike on the Colebart shoal, or ridge of Dungeness, -on the 10th of January last, while on her passage from Spithead, bound to Leith. After hearing evidence on both sides, the Court decided that there 'had been a want of judgment on the part of the prisoners in keeping the ship Pembroke too long on the starboard tack when laying the said ship to, standing off and on in the vicinity of shoal water, and a want of due caution in not making use of the deep-sea lead line - and also a want of sufficient attention paid to the hand lead line; for which the Court direct that Captain Fraser be severely reprimanded, and admonished to be more careful In future; and in consideration of the numerous high testimonials produced by MIr. Jeffery, they do only direct that
ie also be severely reprimanded, and admonished to be more careful in future, and the Court do acquit Lieutenant HRurt from the charge binrought against him.
The Driver wnill be paid off at Sheerness on Tuesday next,

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Permit me to draw attention to an aooustic property of the great bell which I distinctly noticed this afternoon.
On proceeding to Westminster, between half-past 1 and 2 eclock, when about ha]f-way down Regent-street, a sonorous sound repeatedly and forcibly struck my ear. I felt z onvinced it was that of the great bell, although at first it in no way coincided with your description in musical notation. The sound I heard was many degrees more acute, and it was miot until I began to descend the steps at Carlton-gardens that I became sensible of the deeper and more powerful tone, and convinced that the sound which I at first heard was an "harmonic!'-the major third-of that which you hare so accurately stated to be the fundamental note of the bell.
Two interesting conclusions can be drawn from this 4circumstance.
1. That if in the design of tho bell the old " formula" of bell designers has been disregarded, it may be with impunity, for the bell certainly produces that difficult "harinonim" which it was their aim to obtain.
2. That the acuter sounds of a vibrating instrument, even of a bell, travel further than the less acute, and can be dis. tinuniihed when the identity of the graver or deeper sounds IS ~estxoyed by noise.

(FROM OUiR OWN COtRBSIONDINT -
DUBLIN, WDESD&- IiOBrIG. THE IRISH POOR LAW.
A deputation of provncial delegates has had an interview with the Earl of Carlisle for the purpose of bringing under the consideration of the Governnient a plan for the autalgaation of several Poor Law unionsa and thereby effecting a large saving by the reduction of establisnment charges. The memorial was not without interest, as showing the extraordinary decline of pauperism in almost all quarters of the country, etd the positive folly if not worse of keeping up permanent staffs of officials whoe sole duty is nearly narrowed to the task of receiving their quarterly salaries. His Excellency, after giving a patiet hearing to the deputation, replied at some length, adroitly touching upon those passages in the memorial which bore evidence of the improved working of the Irish Poor Law:
" The Lord-Lieutenent said the address wvas certainly a very striking statemcnt of facts, the general hearngorOf which one could not be sorry for. The decrease to so large an extent of pauperism in the country was a matter of congratulation. He quite agreed with the gentlemen present that it did not diminish the duty of those intrusted -with the charge of such matters in trying to effect every possible proportionate reduction of the expense which would have become unaeoessary. It was very true that the accommodation in the workhouses-the "are room in them-did very much exceed the demandspon it; but he did not know what guarantee they had against a differentstate of things arising, under which the present proportion might cease to exist or be probably reversed. They might not have anything ike the same state of circumstances that existed at the time of the famine and the difficulties caused by sickness, but it was impossible to say they might not recur to some extent, and if they now parted with the present workbouse accommodation it would not be the same thing to provide it again, He was sure the deputation would feel keenly for the real interests of the poor, who were not exactlyrepresented there, and it might be a question whether they would fare as well if the area of the unions were considerably increased, and if they were placed at a greater distance from the place where relief was to be administered in ase of sickness. There had been already some very lamentable instances of life lost in thetransit toexistingworkhouses,andifthenum ber were reduced that danger would be, of course, increased. He merely threw out these things as matters for consideration, and they should induce the Government to consider well before they gave any positive pledges on the subject. It would be the duty of the Government and of the Poor Law Commissioners to consider what reductions of expenditure could be made, and to have them carried out. It was gratifying to find, as he did from authentscated documents, that within the last six years the cost of officers' salaries and rations in Lreland had been reduced from 165,00.L to 106,0001., and the establishment charges had been reduced from 376,0001. to 172,0001. That was good work so far as it went, and it would be the duty of those charged with the matter to perEevere in that course. There was, as he had already said, even among those present, considerable difference of opinion as to the advisability of amalgamating unions and increasing their area to any very great extent. The Government would leave themselves open to receive the opinions of others not present; but he was sure it would be the wi3h of all concerned to prosecute to the utmost possible extent a just and intelligent economy, so far as it could be consistently done, having reg td to those who were the paramount objects of the Poor Law legislation-the poor."

Robbery Of Gold 20 Years Ago.-On the
ROBB1:RY OF GoLD 20 YEARS AGo.-On the evening of the 30thof Octobor, 1836, the Defiancecoach left Dover for London, carrying, among other articles, several canvass bags of gold, which had been consigned from the continent to a firm in the city. On thefollowing morning, upon the arrival of the coach at the Golden-cross, the waybill was looked at, and upon examining the fore boot it was discovered that one of the bags, containing a large quantity of gold, was missing. The guard and coachman were questioned upon the subject by the coach proprietors, and said that they could not at all account for the missing bag. The former said that ho saw Matthews, the porter, remove'the bags from the counter of the office and deposit them in the fore boot of the coach, and that he (the guard) and the porter packed the London heavy luggage upon them for their greater security. The coachman said that he left the box but once, and the guard was equally certain that he never left the coach at all during the journey. The guard obtained the assistance of a Bowstreet officer, who returned with him to the Golden-cross, where a most rigid and searching inquiry was instituted among the persons who unloaded the coach; but they failed in obtaining any clue to the perpetrator of the robbery. The offlcer immediately visited all the stations between London and Dover at which the coach had changed horses, questionin "boots," ostlers, stable-keepers, passengers, and soarchnng and overhauling stables and lofts. A similar ceremony was repeated at Dover, the office-clerk stating that he had placed the whole of the bags containing the gold on the counter, from which they were removed by the porter in the tresence of the guard. The porter said that he placoed t e whole of the bags at the
ottom of the boot. The officer examined the coachman, guard, the two ostlers who had stood at the horses' heads, and the porter, and be at once communicated to the proprietors of the hotel his suspicions that the last-named person was the thief. The proprietors of the hotel, however, were of a different opinion, and said they thought the officer was mistaken, as the porter had been in their employment a great number of years, aud they had always found him strictly and thoroughl honest. This did not get rid of the suspicions of the officer, who all along doubted whether the missing bag had been placed in the boot at alL By way of ruse, and with the consent of the coachman and guard, he searched their houses in order that the porter might not suppose that he was the party suspected. Shortly afterwards the house of the porter was searched by the officer, and having a strong impression that the gold was buried in the garden he dug, raked, and pierced it in various places, in the expectation of finding the booty. Thus the matter remnained for a time, the officer tbinking it dedirable to make it appear that all hope of recovering the proprty was gone. About a month afterwards the house of Matthews, the porter, wasagain searched, when the officer found that he had got a quantity of new furniture, bedding, &c.; and be found secreted in one of the rooms 20 sovereigns. Goddard, the officer, immediately took Matthews into custody, and, from inquiries which he made, ascertained that Matthews on the night of the robbery was seen in one of his journeys with the bags to walk behind the coach to the fore boot. Matthews was examined before the in sto and committed for trial, The evidence, however, failed to conneet him with the robbery, aud he was cquitted. About three months afterwards, while Goddard was standing on the steps leading to Bow-street Police-office, a stout, broad-shouldered man, dressed in a suit of dark velveteen, presented himself to him. He immediatelyrecoguizedhin, and said, "Matthews, is that you?' "Yes," was the r eply; I want to see you very particularly to tell you somethinP. Can you meet me this afternoon?" " Yes," replied Goddard. An appointment to meet was made, which Goddard was unable to keep, on account of his being despatched into the country on business connected with the Home-office. hlatthews, finding that Goddard did not keep the ap. pointment, at once roceeded to Dover, and told the
ector of police there that he was a wretched man and
never been happy since his trial. He admittedto the inspector that he stole the bag of gold, and that he had buried it in his next-door neighbour's garden; that he had made repeated attempts to possess himself of it - that his heart always failed him, and that he was afraid of being seen. The inspector forthwith proceeded to the spot indicated, and found the hidden treasure close to the border of Matthews's own garden. Matthews stated that the way in which he effected the robbery was this:-On the occasion of his walking behind the coach, as if for the purpose of proceeding to the boot, he concealed the bag of gold m a large inside breast coat pocket, and so deceived those who were in attendance on the coach. He also said that as the safe was being repaired, and was not fastened in the boot, he concluded that the way in which the robbery was committed would never be discovered.

The Double Murder In Walworth.
T'HE OUBLB MU1DBR IX WALWORTH.,
Yesterday Thomas Fuller Bacon and Martha Bacon, his wife, were again brought up from Horsemonger-lane Gaol, to be further examined-the latter charged on a coroner's inquistion with the wiLful murder of Edwin Fuller Bacon, aged two years and a-half, and Sarah Ain Bacon, aged 11 months; and the former on sspicion of being the actual perpetrator of the dreadfnl deed upon which his unfortunate wife stands charged.
As early as 12 o'clock the court began to fill, and by 1 it was completely crammed with persons of respectability, all of whom evinced the deepest anxiety to bear the further proceedings in this extraordinary case.
Owing to the absence of witnesses, or some other cause, the case was delayed to half-past 2 o'cloclr, at which time the prisoners were brought into court, and placed before Mr. ELLIOiT. The male prisoner was brought in first, and, as on the former examination, he seemed anxious to avoid the gaze of all present, and endea. voured to do so by hurrying to that part of the felons' dock which he occupied on the former day, a seat in which prevented a great part of the audience from having more than a mere profile view of his countenance. He is somewhat improved in his general appearance since hehas been taken into custody, but on entering the dock heap. peared pale and dejected.
Mrs. Bacon continues to improve, and appears to beperfectly sane and rationaL She was accomumodated with a seat, with her friends, in such a position, as she herself requested, that her husband could not see her. When Bacon supposed she had entered the court he assumed a little more confidence, and, standing up in the dock, looked anxiously towards the place where she sat in the hope of being able to see her. Finding that he could not do sohe again sat down apparently gloomy and indifferent.
Mr. Woodward, as on the former occasions, attended for Bacon, and Mr. Bonner, of the firm of Wright and Bonner of London-street, Fenchurch-street, appeared for the firs time for Mrs. Bacon.
The firt witness called was Inspector Young, who was examined at considerable length respecting the W'rious mis. statements of the prisoner Bacon abent the alleged robbery and the descriptions which he gave of his lost pzopert, and from his evidence it appeared that there was not a statement made by him respecting a single thing in which he did not grossly prevaricate, and give two or three versions of it. In the first place the prisoner stated that a 51. note stolen was one of four which he received in change for a check he received from M1r. Atter, his attorney, and repeated over and over again that those four notes were the only notes he had reoeived, or in fact had all the time he had been in town - but when he (Young) had ascertained that he had changed a fifth note, Baon, on being challenged with the fact, admitted it, and accounted for the possession of the fifth note by sayng he had changed it in the street for a parson who was a perfect stranger to him, and of whom he knew nothing whatever. His description of his clothes, which were alle"ed to have been stolen from his housc, was just as unsatisfactory, as was also the account, or rather accounts, which he gave of the serious cut on the first finger of the left hand, and which cut, by the statement of his wife, he received in the struggle, and while attempting to cut her throat after destroying the children. In addition to his evidence on these points Mr. Young said that, on the evening of Tuesday, the 30th of December, after the discovery of the murder, he sent a constable to Reigate to bring Bacon to town, and on the following morning, on his (Bacon) coning to him to the stationhouse at 6 o'clock, he told him that his wife had attempted to destroy herself by cutting her throat, and was then in custody for so doing. The prisoner appeared very much agitated, and inquired what had become of his children. And he witness), not wishing at that time to teU him the worst, replied that the children were aU right. The prisoner said he knew three women who came from the same place who had gone in the same way, and on his (Mhr. Youmes) asking him in what way he meant, he replied, "Out of their mind." Witness next asked him rhere his wife canme from, and the prisonerreplied, "Stmford, Lincolnshire." Baconthen expressed a wish to see his children, and he (lfr. Young) sent a constable with him to the house No. 4, Fouracrestreet, knowing that he could not see them; and he returnedin about half an hour, saying he hadnotbeen enabled to see his children, but added, "I have seen the blood of my dear boy." He then said he should go to the house of his aunt, Mmrs Payne, and witness saw nothing more of him until the inquest. On Wednesday, the 7th of January, witness, accompanied by Sergeant mroad, went to make a farther search of the house, and found the prisoner Bacon there. On seeing him, and more particularly on his putting to him various questions respecting the lost clothes, he became dreadfully aitated, and trembled very much onL his teling him that Mr. DLxon, of Stamford, his tailor, had denied ever having made for him any coat resembling the top coat he said he had lost. On that occasion, while in the kitchen, and in passing from it, he observed a sort of coal hole with some rabbish in it, and on his expressing a wish to overhaul it the prisoner became again much agitated, and wanted very much to go, saying he had an appointment with his brother. He (Mr. Young), however, told him they would have a look among the rubbish in the coalhole first, and sent for a candle for the purpose of procuring a light. At this time he left the prisoner in the care of Sergeart Broad, whilehe (Mr. Young) went into one of the rooms, and in a short time he heard a scaffling noise in the yard which attracted his attention, and in going there he found Bacon in the grasp of the sergeant. He asked the cause, and Sotgeant Broad told him that, though he had given Bacon orders to the contrary,he had rushed into the coihole, and after rummaging amonz the rabbish came out with a handful from which he had taken something which he deposited in his left-hand trousers' pocket. wltness, in consequence, put his hand into the trousers' pocket of Bacon, and there found a watch, the number of which he had, and which the prisoner described to be his property, as well as another watch which he said had been stolen, but which had been since found.
Mfr. .ELLiovT.-Do you recollect the prisoner at any time saying how he thought the person had got into the house to commit the murder and the robbery?
Inspector Young.-No, I don't recollect his telling me so; but I recollect his saying in this court that he did not think his wife had done it, but that it had been done by some one getting in at the door. The witness here produced a r of trousers, which it was alleged Bacon wore on Monra_ the 29th of December, the day of the murder, on which he had found several spots of blood, and also a waistcoat with one spot of blood upon it, and apiece of rope and thick cord, which ho found in the garden of the house, 4, Fouracre-street.
In cross-examination by Mr. Woodward, that gentleman asked how it was that Inspector Young had not in the former evidence given by him, and particularly on the last examination, made the statements he gave in evidence that
dang5pect Your,g.-I was not examined on the last day. .Prisoner.-Indeed you were examined, though.
MSr. ELLIOTr (to Mlr. Woodward).-You will recollect that the inspectorwas called at the last examination, when the enidence he had given on a former day was read over to him; and as there was not time to take his further statement it was reserved till to-day
Mr. Woodward.-Very well, Sir, I am satisfied with the explanation; but with respect to this garden where you said you found the rope and the cord. I suppose it is a garden with a low fence, and that any of the neighbours would have an opportunity of throwing those articles there ?
Inspector Yoang.-Yes, they would.
Mr. Bionner,-I think I understood you to say, Mr. Young, that you saw the rope and cord you produce in the house where the mutrder had been committed at one of your early visits to it ?
Inspector Young.-Yes, Sir, I saw them there.
Mr. Woodward.-Then, why not have carried them away and produced them?
Inspector Young.-Because at that time I was not aware that either a cord or rope had been used; and had only become acquainted with the fact by the confession of Mrs. Bacon, that her husband had not attempted to cut her throat, but to strangle her by putting a rope or cord round her neck.
Sergeant Broad corroborated much of the testimony of his inspector, and added that, while MIr. Young was examining the papers that were strewn about the coalhole, the prisoner evinced the most intense anxiety and trembled very much at every scrap the inspector picked up.
Prisoner.-You had better tell what the papers were.
Witness.-They were portionsof receiptsfor furniture.
Ms. Ann Hyde, a witness who had been examined on a former day, was recalled. This witness, it wiU be recollected, had been sent for to sit up in the house with the prisoner nd M. Payne andher daughter after the murder, and sho deposed to the prisoner saying on several occasions that he did not believe that his wife had done it, but, if she sad anything to implicate him in the matter, he would kill her; and the witness acknowledged that she had her own mspicions as to the real murderer. In addition to what she had formerly stated, she said that two or three nihts after going to the house, and at about
before a locking-glss, ithhiselboon the mantelahelf and his forehead on the palm of his hand, and it misht be he was dozing, when he exclaimed, 'Good &od! how was
itIdn t h ines the rop
whether asleep or awake, in a conitinual state of un happy
s The witness further sa she bad seen the rope a cda produced at the house immedately on her goig there.
Mrs. Payne; the a it of Bacon, was next called, and when sworn she was addressed b the magistrate, who said that, from representations which hd been made to him, he much fearedi she had not stated in her former examination all she knew of the matter under investigation He now, however hoped that she would give her evidence as she was bound to do, and tel the whole treth. The witness here went over a portion of her former evidence, And concluded by saying that the prisoner had always said be was certain his wife did not do it.
Mfr. Bonner.-Now, Mrs. Payne, have you not, in the presence of Mrs. Munro,, your daughter, charged Bacon with doing it, and not his wife?
Mrxs. Payne.-I did not do so, but my husband did. Mfr. Bonner.-What did your husband say?
)irs. .P~e.-Inspeakingofithe said, "I don't say you did it, or cud not, but Suppose your wife was to turn round and to say Tou did it "and he said something about her not deceiving him.
Mir. Bonner.-Were xot his words these, "I'm sur s'he won't split upon or deceive mae."
Mrs. Payne.-They were something like that, buit I did not heartbena distinctly, as I was2n the next room.
Mr. ELLuoTT.-Is your husbandl Itere? Witness.-No, Sir.

The Paper Duty.
TffX PAPER DUTY.
DEPUTATION TO THE CMANCULOR OF TE
EXOHEMOTFR.
Yesterday, at 1 o'clock, a number of gentlemen, most of them members of the Association for Promoting the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge, with Mr. 3ilner Gibson, MLP., at their head, had an interview with the ChanceUor of the Exchequer, at his officl residence in Downing-street, for the purpose of pressing on his attention the necessity of repealing the Excise duty on paper.
Mr. MiSaZR GiBsOw briely introduced the deputation to the right hon. gentleman, describing it as being composed of gentlemen belonging to the abovenamed society and of others interested in the manufacture of paper, and also in trade generally. Theirobject, he added, was tobring under the consideration of the Government the necessitv of dealing with the paper duty on its own merits and as a matter of financil poly. The subject had already been investigated by Parliamentary committees and commissions, and successive Ministers had held out expectations that this paper duty ought to be dealt with; but it had been postponedfromtirme to time, andthe deputation had thought that no further delay should stand intho way of the question being seriously entertained by the Government. There were gentfleman present who would point oub to the right hon. gentlemen some of the evils of the tax, and he should not therefore occupy more time, except to say that mant of the best friends of education throughout tho country thought the primary thing to be done towvards csrrying out their views5on that subject WaS to remove the obstacles wFhich nowv stood in the way of the diffusion of knowzledge.
Mr. C. D. COLLxrr seroetlaerdyofth Soiyfrth Repeal of the Taxes on Kinowledge, then read a mnemoria setting forth their views on tho subject under consideration, of which the following are the morematerisl parts-.-After citing the advocacy of the repeal o' the duty by the Chancellor's predecessors, Mr. udiadstone, who was nearly pledged to it while m offioe, if there had been no military and naval expenses in the way; and Mr. Disraeli, who, with a number of Conservative gentlemen, voted in 1851 "for the removal of tho impediments in the path of almost the only rural manufacture we have left," it stated that someidea might be formed of the mischief done by the tax on paper if the great development of the manufacture since the duty was reduced was borne in mind.

(A, laugh.)
AldermancBA,l wnk said he had been connected with the paper trade for 40 years in Birmingham, ead had had a paper mill in that town for 21 years. Two years agio he fmned the office of Mayor of dirmoingham, and he had therefore had opportunities of knowing the evil effects of the paper duty on the various kinds of mnanufacture connected with the Birmnghm h trade. Within the last year he had paid as much as enab1l to the Exchequer in the shape of paper duty. He had sold the pa]pr on which that duty was p%id for 35,0001,,sEo that he hadhad to relinquish as nearly 1ras possble 2-5thc of that sum forExcise duty alone; in other
twor ohe poitively worked 20 weeks of the 52 in realizing the amount he had to pay to the Government for duty, Iconsuming every week- 100 tons of coal in his business,
besides wages for labour and other incidental outgoings. Haohad therefore a good right to complain, and the more so as his was the only manufacturing trade in the whole comitry that was saddled with the Excise, the duty having been tabken offleather, glass, bricks, ad many other articles to the great benefit of the comaunity, and attended wth no diminution to the revenue, seeing that the remission had opened up additional means of employmnent to the lntouring and artisan population, who were thereby enabled to spend *more money on the necessaries and to some extent on the luxuries vofalife, sometofwhichwereartic charged with

Ched CnAcELLoR of t'he ExcirEquLit.-But does not the duty fral on the consumer?
Alderman Binto acusaid to some extent it fell on the consumer, but what he wanted to show was that the manufacturer got no profit on the duty. He (Alderman Baldwin) produced apic of button beard, out of which discs,like goun wade, 20 p been cut for the making of Florentine buttons, such as every man wore on his coart and in the maufacture of which thousands of people were employed, Twog ears ago those discs, as well as the waste board from fohi withey had been cutriaid a duty, which enhanced the price of that kind of butta by 7n per cent., the result being that the French hd German manufacturers of Florentine buttons, who paid no duty, werefenableid to beat the English button manufacturers in foreign markets.

The CHLnEuaolt of the EXCKEQuER-Youx are entitled, in accordance with the strictest rule of fre trade, to have a Customs duty equivalent to an Excise duty; otherwise you -would not he on fair terms.
Alderman BAmlsywn said he would shLow how unfairly the paper duty acted on the export trade. A little time ago ha received an order for 10 tons of common brown packing
per for exportationi, but, as the personx who gave it him~red out to be a swindler, ho (Alderman Baldwin) got hsis paper back again, althoughx it hsadbeen enteredt for export. The resut of the transAction, however, proved that, taking into account the expense he was at in packing the p aper in a peculiar way to comply with the Excise requisctions and other incidental considerations, there was a positive loss of 20 per cent., attributable to the Excise laws, ontevery 1 c-wt. of common paper exported from this conr.On the other hand, that common pper , when ineddfor exprtation, mnight, but for the absrd Exctse regulations as to pacldng, be conveyed in the shape of ballast, for which it was admirably adapted, weighinig, as it did, about 401b. a-ream, and being very convenient for stowing.

make a superior article of that nature, which was done by pasting sheets together, he had then to pay, considering that he was liable to duty, not onlyon the mranufactured article, but on the waste resulting from it, a duty varying from 201. to 221. a-ton. The consequence was that the manufacturars in Germany and France, who were liable to no such drawback, were mnostlv engaged in making the best articles of that descrptioi, wlile those in England mrado only the commoner kinds on which no duty was payable, and were losing their reputation for ability to make anything better. He had been at the pains to calculate the ordinary expenditure of 50 persons who worked at this sort of trade, and the
result proved that out of every sovereign they spent 3s. 4d. went to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the saio of duty on the tea, coffee, sugar, tobaco, ale, and spirita they consmed. So that, bytandDgoffthe dutyon paper, if they ould give a vastlygreateramount of employmentm itsmannfacture, which he contended would be the necessay result of the remission, the consequent loss to the revenue would be compensated by the gain resulting to it from the greater consamption of excisea%le articles. This was one of the most useful and necessary trades in the ceuntry, and thero was a great amount of capital and ingenuity employed in it. People in the town from which he came said when they heard the fuss made about national education that it was all humbug, so long as the duty was retAined on an arlicle which entered so extensively into the matter of education.

price of the common copybook and the firgt books usod at schoel by the children of poor people 30 per cent.
The CHASCELLO.-And yet yon think the tax does not fall on the consumer, but on the manufacturer ?
Alderman BALDWIX did not s&y that. The tax fell on the manufacturer ia the first instance, and all he (Alderman Baldwin) said was that the manufacturer did not get any profit on the duty paid.
The CRANCE.LOF-Do yon think he ought to mako a profit on the duty he pay4
Alderman BEAnw i thought there ought to be no duty at all. (A laughi) He ho:d the Chanoellor would be of the same opinion. Every book that was published was as nearly as posible wholly the result of labour, nd if the right hon. gentleman kept that in view he (Alderman Baldwmin) was sure he would abolish the paper duty. Since the abolition of the stamp duty on newspapers from 40.000 to 50,ODO copies of rnewsppers were published we"e in Birningham, instesad of 156000 which was the numberbeore the stamp was remitted, and Le ventured to say if the duty on paper was taken off, the revenue in three years would be benefited, instead of injured, by the change. He had a great desire to see the duty repealed, not only for his own sake, but for that of the community generally. In a village, for instance, four miles from Birmingham, where many poor people were unemployed and living on the poor-rates, he was spuding 10000i. in the erection of a apr.mnl, which, f the duty was taken off paper, wouldpkeep 50 familfies off the parish.
The CHAN-cELor.-Let me ask yoe one question. You believe that 30 per cent. of the Xresent price of books ig ewing to the dut on paper? [r. BALDWIn-.-On cheap copy and school oks it is; but the price of costly books is not much enhanoed by it.] Do yoe tbink the remiasion of th du ould lead to any perceptible reduction in the pnre or newspapers?
Mr. BALD-w-w.-ThSt had been the effect of taking off the stamp.
The CHAxcnELOL.-But I am speaking of the paper-duty. I will ask you if any newspaper would lower its price in consequence of the remission of the paper-duty?
Alderman BALDwLN said they would either lower their price or give a better article for the present price. Some of thepenny paperwere doing well, but they would not be carned on unles the duty onpper was repled.
Mr. J. HYDE reminded the Chance or hat at the time the Messrs. Chambers were selling 60,000 of their penny tracts a-week they were obliged to relinquish the undertaking in consequence of tho enormous sum they paid in paper cl, which of itself wozld have been a handsome profit to 'em.
Mr. J.1EL RAWixvs, a papermaker at Wrexham, smid this was the onlv country in the worldthat imposed a tax on the diffusion of knowledge. The truth was that, like the shoe of a Chinese lady the ct of Parliament imposing this tax on the paper tae had been graduaUy pinching more and more as that trade developed itself, until it had become almost intolerable. He prodauced five sample of brown paper obtained during a recent Wisit to the United States, made from flax straw, old leather, Indian corn stalkh, palm leaves, and damaged marsh hay, and sold at prices below the sums charged for duty in England, and stated in somedetailhow marvellously the paper trado flourished in tho American Union, where it was wholy unrestricted by Excise or any other imposts. He contended that threefourths of the papermakers in this country were either living on their capital or losing money. The dutj was so heavy and relentless in its character that, like the sword of Damocles, it was perpetually hanging over the heads of the manufacturers, and it would never be otherwise until the tax was completely swept away.
Alderman BALDYr said one-half of all the paper now made in this country was manufactured by 30 persons; the trade would be soon in fewer hands, and it would be in the power of those few persons to atop the press any day they might choose to do so.
The CH&NcELLoR asked whst Proprtion of all the paper made was used for the puxpose 1 prnuting.
Alderman BALDWIm said considerably more than a third, and perhaps 1-8th or 1-10th ws used as writing paper.
: Mr. John Watts, Mr. Elt, Ylr. Bucknall, of Stroud and Mr. B. LAngley, bore teetimony to the way in which the duty operated to repress cheap news.papers and the production of good school books; The latter gentleman complained that the cheap newpper propfietors were obliged to use thin paper, which impeded the rapidity with which they mih otherwise be printed.
The CEL . said it struck him that the English newspapers in general were printed on thicker and better paper than those of any other country, and et the deputation said there vas no duty on the article in any otber country. He added that he would not fail to hear in mind all that they had said on the general subject. They had brought under his consideration many facts bearing cose
an the question; but all he could ay at present was that this moment was not a very favourable one for entertaining bhe question of a reduction of duty, so far as that was likely to entail a diminution of revenue.
The deputation then retired.
