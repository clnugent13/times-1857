The weight and power of the railway comnmunityehoulo be brought tobear in favuar of the moderate views
adocate by Mr. Glyn and Mr. Ricthard Mbalins in the House of Commons. viz. a relaxation of the absolutely limited issue to 14.000,000 benk notes on Govemrauent necuritice. If 14,000.000 were sufficient in 1851 they are not always sufficient now, wrhen the export of bullion reduces the aggregate of notes in circulntion, the trade and operations of the coontry haviagl miore than doubled, and In many instances trebled ninces that dato.

. President-The Right Hon. the Earl of SHAFTESBURY.
The Committee are compeUed to make a special nd earnest APPE-AL to the public for increased support.
During the last three yearn 34 additional scbool-houses have been opened, making a total of 10 Ragged School buildiogs In london and suburbs, in which 343 sebools are oDnducted, affordinginstrucUon to about 20.000 children, who would otherwise be destitute of all secular snd religions education.
Ragged Scho Ils are like mis3ionary stations in low nelghbourhoods, having in many cases connected with them refuges, industrial classes, peony banks, parents' meetings, and tending libraries for the poorest sond most negiected of the population,
Uder the present M1tnuts or Privy Council, Ragged Schools are umable to obtaIn Government aid, and therefore must entirely rely upon volentary contribtnIons. Mffany of them being aituate inethe mee3t desUtitte parts of the metropolis, can leek for very little local support, and are necessarily dependent on theh Central Society for their sietisice.
There are 16 Refuges In counexion with the Union, containing neary 500 inmates. The urgent claims made upon the Union during the last few days have caused a continualy increasing expenditure, while, for various causes, its income has not increased In the same proportion, and, unless liberal assistance be aftorded them, the Committoe Wi5. be obliged to materially diminish their efforts for the Scriptural education of the neglected and criminal children of the metiopolis.
Contnbutions wTil be thankfully rwceived by the Secretary, Mr. Joseph G. Gent, 1, Exeter-halL London.

At the commencement Of the undertaking I wasu soolcit by the proinmotrs to taks the chair and chief direction of the Company's arbirs, and believing, from MY long exPerience in omnibus conveyance, that .i could be of material assistance to tho aooPan and servire to the publicby joining the undertakinig I dd so, And &iTsefrom thattlmie exerted mybelf as much an possible to bring into use the saloon omsunbus which I believe possess quasiicatiOns which wouldbea ereelated. I have found, howeve that ixnsupemble diffOcuties av

Att, ti jnctur openedacmmuca tonwith the London General Omnibus CompaLny, in the hope that they being an established Company, and manifesting a willingness to gilve the public the advantage of an improvedconvyance, would give a trial to our saloon omDt bus. I was met by them in a fair spirit, and a deputation from the two
hosrds met, with a view to an arragement of the'kind, which rested in an offer of the London General Omnibus Company to purchase thu interest of our Company for about £1,300, whereby our shareholders might beeimburced, andtho omn busnworked for the pub benefit,
and a ruinous competition with a powertul organized cosnany prevouted. Others of the DIrector of the Saloon Company have, however, t h orei in anothmr solicitor to their CDmplny, who, proposing

REPORTED BOMBARDMENT OF CANTON.
The Earl of CARNARVON wished to know whlether there was any truth in the statement which had appeared in the public papers that at the departure of the last mails Admiral Seymour had commenced throwing red-hot shot into Canton. As such a proceeding was usually regarded as the last resort to be adopted in civilired warfare, it would be satisfactory to the public if the noble earl could say the report was unfounded.
Earl GRANVILLE replied that he had no reason to believe-that the report referred to by the noble earl was correct, but, on the contrary, at the latest dates the admiral was helding his position without adopting any fresh measures at present.
The Earl of DERBY took the opportunity of giving notice of his intention to bring forwardL on Tuesday next a resolution respecting the recent events in China. He was not able to state precisely the terms of that resolution, but they would be generally expressive of regret at the hostle steps taken at Canton, as not justified by the circumstances, alt ough his opinion upon that point might be modified by papers which he had not yet seen.
The Earl of CARNARVON presented a number of petithons praying for the repeal of the Maynooth grant from the parishes of NTewbury, Kiinthury, Worldsend, East Ilsley, E;amabury, Chieveley, Theale, llrightwaltham, Thatcham, Inkpen, Winterbourne, East Shefford, and Leck-
CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATUTES. In reply to a question from Lord BROUGIH&M,
The LORD CHANCELLOR said the Statute Law Commission had been engaged during the recess in preparing a nunber of bills, and it was his intention at an early day in this or the following week to lay upon the table seven bills, forming a complete consolidation of criminal offences. Those bills had been prepared before the end of last session, and in their then state they were laid upon the table of the house, but they applied in part to England and in part to Bngland and Ireland. Thinking that but an imperfect consolidation, during the recess he had sent over those bills to Ireland to be corrected by Irish lawyers, but when they were returned it was found that, thus
ltered, they would be but incongruous measures, aud that it would be better to have two sets of bills. He preposed to lay tbosebills on the table, and then he would state in some detail exactly what had been done and what was being done by the commission. He could only wish that those persons who saidthe commission did nothing bad an opportunity of understanding one-tenth part of the difficulties which beset the work on which they were engaged. He might state, for instance, that they had found it absolutely necessary to begin from the statutes passed last year, and to go backward through the whole statute-book section by section, in order to see what sections still remained in force which required to be consolidated. He would not say more on the subject of the blls to which he referred, except that it was his wish to proceed with them at an early period of the semsion, but he would not go further until he saw his way clearly.
Lord BROUGIAM said, he wished to ask his noble and learned friend on the woolsack what means he had taken, or thought he could take, to obtain, he would not say the prospect, but the possibility of anything like a digest of the statute as well as of the common law passing through the two Houses of Parliament? It was easy to complain of digests having been prepared and never passed. It was no fault of the commissioners that those digests had not passed; it was the fault, he feared, of our Parliamentary constitationi for on two separate occasions had digests on the criminal law, which had been skilfully and carefully prepared by the commissioners-those industrious, learned, and under-paid men,whowerenowthe objectsof suchunmeasured attacks, he would not say in the other House of Parliament, but oub of doors-on two occasions, he said, had digests on the criminal law been brought in in parts and very nearly passed through their lordships' house. His nobl. and learned friend on the woolsack, as well as Lord St. Leonard's and another noble and learned friend of his not now in his place, with him (Lord Brougham) himself, came to the lamentable conclusion some time ago that it was in vain to pass a digest of 1,500 articles in their lordships' bouse and then send it down to be discussed in another place by 120 barristers, attorneys, and 300 or 400 magistrates, each having an attorney at his elbow to suggest doubts and difficulties at every step, in the hope of being able to pass it [into a law. (Hear, hear.) There was but one course to take, which teas that adopted with resuect to Sir R. Peel's bill for the consolidation of the law of larceny -namely, that confidence, or almost entire confidence, should be given to the skilful, learned, and experienced men who set themselves to draw up that digest, and after that was done that Parliament-he would not ssy in every particular, but generally-should accept and adopt it. Did they wish to have a digest or not? If they did, it was on those terms alone that they could have it. He trusted that on this subject he might be found for once in error as a prophet of evil, as he was sometimes designated, and that he was not taking a too desponding view of it; but he was confident that the sooner men laid to their hearts that abstinence which he had suggested in the consideration of a digest the better. He hoped these matters would be seriously considered by those who were desirous, year afteryear, to obtainthisgreat boon. As to the charge that the learned men originally intrusted with the preparation of a digest-namely, Hr. Bellenden Ker, Mr. Starkie, Professor Amos, Justice Wightman, and Mr. Jardine-were overpaid, he might state that they were all paid 2,000l. a-year. e (Lord Brougham) objected to that, and suggested that they ould be paid by the piece instead, which brought down the payment to i,oee. a-year. Air. Bellenden Ker was the only one who continued in the commission; and why? Because Mr. Jardine was appointed a police nmagistrate, Mr. Wightman was made a judge, and Professor Amos went to India; and now, because Mr. Bellenden Ker had had no opportunity of being promoted in his profession, and remained in. the commission, he was made the scapegoat for the sins of the whole comnission. As to Mr. Ker being a sordid man, he (Lord Brougham) thought he should give a sufficient ansswer to that imputation when he stated that absolutely on four commissions lie served for nothing.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said all that his noble and learned friend had stated with regard to MIr. Bellenden Ker was founded entirely in truth ; and he (the Lord Chancellor) would add that he never in his life saw a more laborious or aless selfish man. (Hear, hear.) The bills, for example, which he had stated his intention shortly to introduce, though they had been revised by different members of their lordships' House, were almost entirely to be referred to the labours of Mr. Ker in the discharge of his duty as one of the present commissioners.
PETrITONS FOR PRIVATE BILLS.
On the motion of Lord REDEBDALE it was resolved
" That this House will not receive any petition for a private biU after Monday, the 23d of March next, unless such private bill shall have been approved by the Court of Chancery; nor any petition for a private bill approved by the Court of Chancery after Ttuesday, the 19th of May next; that this House will not receive any report from the judgles upon petitions presented to this House for private bils after Tuesday, the 19th day of May next.
RAILWAY COMPANIES AND COUNTY-R -ATES.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE, in presenting apetition from certain ratepayers of the county of Ga"Iwa
against empowermng railway companies to have interest upon their capital secured upon the rates of counties, expressed his opinion that, althoulgh for certain purposes it snighe be beneficial that some kind of a guarantee should be given, he did not think that that guarantee should be on
The Earl of LUCAN considered that guarantees were not necessary, because as railway schemes had been so much more successful in Ireland than in this country any good project would, in aU probability, meet with support.
After some further conversation the petition was ordered to lie on the table.
Their lordships adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.

THE FRANKLIN EXPEDITION. In reply to Sir De L. EvAs,
Sir C. WOOD said thatthe Government had not yet come to a decision on the subject of this expedition, but as soon as they did they would inform the Rouse. An estimate would be necessary if the expedition were decided upon.
LEGISLATION FOR SCOTLAND.
MKr. BAXTER wished to ask the Lord Advocate whether he intended to bring in a bill this session extending to the Scotch counties the provisions of the Registration of Voters Bill, passed last year for the burgbs * and also whether it was his intention to introduce a police bill for Scotland.
The LORD ADVOCATE.-It is my intention to bring in a bill upon both subjects.
THE MEGiERA TROOPSHIP.
Sir J. PAKINGTON rose to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty what was the cause of the detention of the Megera troopship at Portsmouth after the time fixed for her sailing for the Mauritius with troops; also, whether it is true that shortly after she sailed she sprang a dangerous leak, which would probably have caused the loss of the ship had the accident occurred at a greater distance from land - also, whether the repairs which the MIegsra is now a2Ain undergoing at Plymouth are such as will enable the Admiralty to feel confident that she will be in a fit state to convey 400 or 500 of Her Majesty's troops to so distant a part of the world.
Sir C. WOOD said that, in reply to the lirst question the officer in command of the Meg;era had miscalculated the time required to clean the Bshp after she carne out of dock, and reported that she would be ready to embark the troops sooner than she really was. Sir G. Seymour, on inspecting the Moegera, found that she was not in a fit state to receive troops, and that it would be very uncomfortable to the troops to be embarked on board on the day named. He therefore postponed the embarcation until the vessel was in a fit state for their accommodation. His answer to the second question wa.s that it was not tree that she did spring a dangerous leak. It turned out that two small screws in the bottom of the ship were not fixed, and that two small holes were therefore left In the bottom of the ship. The water came through these holes, but he believed that with a hand-bucket she would have gone round the world in safety. With regard to the third ques. tion it could not be doubted that wheni these holes were stepped up in her lower cabin the Megiera would be able to perform the duty asigned to her, of going to the Mauritius, as satisfactorily as she had performed her work for the last
Lord A. VANE TEMPEST wished to know whether a similar occurrence did not happen to the Megaera when she was conveying the first battalion of the Rifle Brigade a second time to the Cape. He had in his hand a statement from a relative of one of the officers on board of a totally different description from that given by the First Lord of the Admiralty. (Cries of " Order.") Re would move that the House do now adjourn ("Oh 1"), and would appeal to the indulgence of the Rouse to permit him to make his statement. (Cries of "Rea," cad "IOh.") The letter was as followas:-
"My relative left Plymouth in the Megiera transport on Sunday last, and had to return to port on Tuesday. It was as much as ever they could do to keep the water from rmisng more than three feet in the lower cabin." This did not agree with the "little holes" described by the First Lord of the Admiralty. (Hear) "She was just out of dock, and has now gone in for large repairs; meantime 500 men are sent on board a hulk ship-a precious waste of public money from bad management.'
He wished to know whether a similar occurrence did not happen to the Megnera on a former occasion.
Sir C. WOOD.-There were two screw holes found open, and whether that was dangerous he would leave the flouse to judge. The Megera had been taken into dock, and would proceed again on her voyage directly.
Mr. KNOX said he had good authority for stating that the leak was in the bows of the ship.
Sir 0. WOOD had said nothing inconsistent with that statement. The leak was in the bows of the ship; but it was seven feet under water.
The motion for the adjournment of the House was then withdrawn.
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.
Mr. J. G. PHILLIMORE rose to ask whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Ministers to bring forward any measure founded on the report of the committee of last session on the appointment of a public prosecutor.
The SOLICITOR-GENRAL said that the subject had been for some time under the consideration of Government. The questibn was one of the greatest difficulty, and the Govermment were not at present prepared to bring in a bill.
THE RESOLUTE.
Mx. ROEBUCK said the House was aware that the Resolute had been presented to this country by the Government of the IUnitea States. A very current report prevailed that the Government had ordered her to be pulled to pieces. Perhaps the Govemnment would state whether the report was well founded ?
Sir C. WOOD said, as & short answer would be the most 1atisfactory, he would simply state that the report was untrue. (Cheers.)
THE NEAPOLITAN PAPERS.
Air. COCHRANE asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Neapolitan papers presented to Parliament comprised allthe despatches from Lord Clarendonto the British Mission at Napres between the 19th of May, when Her Majesty's Government recommended the GoveXiment of the Two iciles to grant a general amnesty, and October the 10thZ when the .Bntssh Mtission was instructed to leave NFapAl Also, awt what period and on what conditions Her MIajesty's Governmentintended resuming diplomatic relations with the kIdngdom of the Twio Sicilies 9
Lord PALMERSTON.-In answer to the first question, I have to state that the papers which have been presented do not contain all the despatches sent from the Foreignoffice, but that they do contain all the despatches which bear upon the matters connected with the purpose for which the papers were presented. There are some despatohes containing instrmctions with reference to contingencies which did not happen, and there are one or two upon totally unimportant matters which have not been laid before the Rouses. I hope I may be allowed, without offence, to answer the hon. gentleman's second question by another question-whether the hon. gentleman has full powers from the King of Naples to arrange the matters in

CASE OF THE ARROW.-PROCEEDINGS AT
CANTON.
Viscount GODERICH asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether it was true that the case of the lorcha Arrow was not the only one in which the authorities of Canton had recently seized or entered u n boats sailing under Brtish colours, or furnished wit a British register- and, if so, whether he would lay upon the table of the house any papers relating to such proceedings; and also, whether he would have any objection to lay before the House any instructions which might have been sent by the home Government to Sir John Bowring on his appointment as Governor of Hongkong, or at any subsequent period previous to October last, on the subject of the exclusion of the British authorities and merchants from the city of Canton?
Lord PALMERSTON.-The papers which have been presented to the House show that there were two former occasions on which lorchas had been molested by the Ohinese authorities, and state the steps taken by Sir J. Bowring on the subject. I will undertake that the instructions to which my noble friend has alluded shall be laid before the House.
Sir J. PAKINGTON.-I wish to put a question to the noble lord in reference to a statement which has appeared in the newspapers on the subject of the bombardment of Canton. That statement is to the effect that the admiral of the station has been bombarding Canton with red-hot shot. I wish to know, therefore, whether the Government have received any information confirming that statement, and, if they have, whether they will object to lay the papers containing such information before the House? (Hear, hear.)
Lord PALMTERSTON.-The only foundation for the report to which the right hon. baronet alludes is this :-The Chinese had set fire to some of the Hongs, and, as there were numbers of them congregated in the space near the Hong; it was thought desirable to disperse them. Some shells were accordingly thrown into that space for the purpose of driving away the crowd that had collected there; they had the desired effect, and the place was cleared, but there was no bombardment of the town, no red-hot shot was ever fired, and the admiral retained his position in the river. (Hear, hear.)
REGISTRY OF MERCHANT SHIPPING.
Mr. WALPOLE asked whether the Government would have any objection to lay on the table a copy of the orders now in force relating to the registry of merchant shipping ?
Mr. LABOUCHERE said they were laid on the table yesterday.
THE SHEEPSHANKS COLLECTION. In reply to Mr. VxRmoN,
Lord PALMEYSTON said there would be no objection to lay on the table a copy of the correspondence whioh had taken place between Her Majesty's Government and Mr. Sheepehan}s with reference to that gentleman's gift to the nation.
On the motion of Colonel DVB, a bill for the regulation of aMtic asylums in Ireland was read a first time.
FISEIERIES (IRELAND).
Mr. M3MAhON rose to mhove for leave to introduoe bill i to assimilate the law as to tbha soa-coast fisheries of Ireland
to that of England. The hon. gentleman said he had been defeated year after year, under some pretence or another, in hisattempts to pass a measure of this kind, although in 1853 a report of the Admiralty admitted the impor tance of the alteration he desired to carry into efirct. The Scotch fishery waa encouraged by a bounty of 14,0001.
.-year, and Ireland, though formerly an exporting country in respect to cured herrings, was nowv obliged, owing to the restrictive laws which had been passed, to import that article of food from Scotland. Those ingeniously contrived laws had had the effect of greatly diminishing the Irish fishing trade, which formerly was so prosperous that the quantity of herrings cured at Wexford in 1654 was not equalled in any town of Great Britain until 3854- 200 years afterwards. He wished that there should be the same laws for Ireland as for England and Scotland in this matter; and referred to certain clauses in the Fisheries Act of 1842, which, he said, prevented the fishermen of Ireland having a free scope for their industry and abilities, It was left to the caprice of the Fisheries' Commissioners-who, by the by, knew nothing whatever about fishing-whether the fishermen of Ireland should be permitted to exercise their calling; and so perversely framed were the fishery laws that they would seem to have been passed for the purpose of absolutely prohibiting the catching of certain sorts of fish. In no other part of the world was the use of fisheries so much interfered with by legal restrictions as in Ireland. A Frenchman or a Belgian mnight by treaty fish within three miles of any part of the coast of Ireland, and an American might set the Irish fishery laws altogether at defiance, while an Irishman was obHged to sue for the permission of a peddling set of commissioners to exercise his sndustry upon his own coasts. He (Mr. M'Mahon) hoped that the House would consent to the introduction of his bill, which would remedy these grievances.
Mr. G. H. MOORE seconded the motion.
Mr. HORSMAN, being unaware of the exact nature of the provsions of the bill, was unwilling, on the part of the Government, to oppose its introduction; but, if he unders ood the hon. and learned gentleman correctly, the bill which he sought to introduce was identically the same in its principles and details with that which was rejected by the House in 1855 by a large majority. The hon. and learned gentleman had said that h-is object was to assimilate the legislation with respect to the fisheries of Ireland to that which regulated the fisheries of England and Scotland; but he (r. Horsman) could assure him that the proprietors of the Englisk and Scotch fisheries would be disposed to ask the House to substituto tho Irish for the English and Scotch fishery laws. (Hear, hear.) The effect of these annunal discussions about the laws relating to the Irish fisheries was very prejudicial to the proprietors of them, and unless the hon. and learned gentleman could assure him that this was not identically the same as the bil of 1855 he should be disposed to ask the House to refuse the motion.
Mr. M'MAHON replied that the bill applied only to the seacoast, and did not interfere with the inland or other fisheries.
Sir G. GREY thought that the House would be better able to discuss this question after the bill had been introduced, but intimated to the hon. member (Mr. M'Mahon) that if this bill was substantially the same as that which he introduced in a previous session he must expect the opposition of the Government.
After a few words from MEr. MK1OoRE and Colonel FRGENCis who hoped that the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for Ireland would extend to the Judgments Execution Bill the principle which he seemed disposed to apply to this billtdhatda measure once rejected should not be again intro-
Leave was given to bring in the bilL
NAVAL ADMINISTRATION.
Captain SCOBELL iose pursuant to notice to move for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the administration of the navy. The hon. and gallant member said that when he made a similar motion last year he was told that a time of war was not a proper season for such an inquiry. He felt the force of that objection; but now we were at peace, aud he thought that for the investigation which he proposed no time could be more fitting than the present. 'his was not a party question, but one of mild administrative reform. If the navy were a perfect institntion no inquiry was needed; butvthe prevaling feeling in the navy was that they were unfairly governed. He complained of no Admiralty in particular-he complained of the system. There was this important difierence between the army and the navy, that while the army had at its head a Eoldier who was not removed by a chanrge of Government, the navy was under the direction of a litical First Lord; and the consequence was that, while in the army politics had nothing to do with promotion, in the navy they had considerable influence. Last year he gave the names of certain officers in the nzvy who had risen from lieutenants to post-captains in from three to four ears, and he also enumerated others who, having entrerdthe service long before those who had got on so rapidly, were, from the want of family or political in. terest, still continued as lieutenants. He woul not rete t those names now, but would merely mention the case of the First Naval Lord himself, who gained his steps from lieutenant to post-captain in less than four years, while many other veterans, who had equally served their country at the cannon's mouth, were shut out from aU such promotion. Parhamentary influence, rather than long service and experience, forced men forward in the navy, and most deserving men were allowed to remain on the heutenants' and commanders' lists till they died, or were sent into retirement on pittanews wretchedly inadequate compared with the sums paid to officers in the army of corresponding rank. To begin with the admirals; we had 100 of them on the active list, only 14 of whom, however, were employed. If we wanted to employ 14 more, our admirals were so old that we could not obtain them. That, surely, was not a proper state of things. On the active list of captains there were 389 who were hable to be called on to serve, only 112 of whom were employed, the remaining 277 being on half-pav. Of active commanders we had 542, of whom. 144 were employed, and 398 on half-pay. Was that a satisfactory mode of conducting the service ? Look at the halfpay awarded to these officers. A naval captain, if he had
ben three years on the list of post-captains, held equal rank with a colonel in the army, Now, the half-pay of the first 70 of these captains was 14s. 6d. per day, or the same rate as a colonel In the line; nearly 100 more got 12s. 6d., or 2e. less than a colonel; and the remainder received bat lOs. 6d. The commanders in the navy rank-ed with the majors of the army. The senior 150 commanders got 10s. per day, being equal to a major's half-pay; while the remainng 392 were paid but 8s. 6d. The tower down they went in the list the greater was the injustice done to the navy. We had 1,138 active heutenants, 795 of them being employed, and 343 on half-pay. All captains in the army (with whom these lieutenants ranked) got 7s. per day, but only 34 out of the whole 1,138 naval lieutenants received 7s. per day, and each of the 34 had an average standing of 43 years in the service. The next 154 got but 6s. a-day, the next 820 but 5&, and the remainder only 4s. He now came to the class of naval cadets, who had been admitted rather more freely than before during the last two years. To neutralize that disturbing element, however, he took the 15 years between 1842 and 1857 as the basis of his calculation. Dunring that period 1_700 cadets had been admitted, while in the same space of time but 836 lieutenants were made from mates, It was impossible to absorb so great a number of cadets, and the consequence was that many officers had to serve 12, 16, or even 20 years before they obtained lieutenants' commissions. The excess of cadets entering the navy during the last 15 years as compared with the lieutenants promoted was 964. The influx of cadets must be cheeked if the pressure for promotion was to be relieved. Not mnore than 40 or SO per annum ought to be admitted; but last year the number entering was 116; and in the year preceding it was considerably higher. We had no fewer than 641reserved lieutenants-disappointed men, who had entered the service with all the first freshness of boyhood, but who were now shelved in middle age, put away out of sight, and left to pine in hopeless inactivity. They ranked with captains in the army, who received 7s. per day. The first 37 got 7s.; but the next 509, who were men varying from 29 to 44 years' standing in the service, received but 6s.; the next S0 but 5s., and the remainder only 4s. Two-thirds of those who went upon the lieutenants' list never got beyond it. Could any stronger proof be adduced of the neoessity for revising the management of the navy list? The commanders retired and reserved were (as we understood) 341 in number; and ranked with majors in the army. The first 96 of them got 8s. 6d. per day, while an army captain got 9s. 6d. or 10s.; and the remainig 245 got only 7s., being the same scale of half-pay as a senior lieutenant of the navy and a captain in the army received. There had lately been a large addition made to the retired captains' list, and it now numbered 306. Most of these retired captains had been senior coomnianders of 30, 40, and 50 years' standing, and all the additional half-pay which they got on being promoted was 6d. a-day, making their half-pay 10s. 6d. a-day, while the half-pay of officers of corresponding rank in the army and marines was 12s. 6d., 13s. Gd., and lSs. a-day. There was no such thing as full pay in the navy; while there were 165 officers in the marines who had retired on full pay. The reason- of this injustice was, that the Admiralty was not a fraternal Government. Those who were in power there had no certainty that they would not be ousted next week, and they therefore had no interest in setting these things righ. As to seamen, the advice he would offer to the
Government was to get as many able seamen as they could into thenav intime of peace; to mnan every ship with two-thirdsorthree-fourths of able seamen, who, when war came, might be distrbuted over double the number of ships, To do this a small bounty and a slight addition of pay must be given to able seamen, and these ought also to be, as a further inducement, a alight advance of pay at the bed of evr aee years. At the present moment there were on the cive list 2,169 officers, frorm the rank of admiral down
to that of lieutenant. Of these 1,065 were employed, and the rest were on half-pay. The retired and thereservedlist numbered 1,711; so that out of the 3,880 admirals, captains,commanders, and lieutenants appearing in the Ayavy List 2,815 were unemployed, It msg'ht be said that the half-pay' of officers in the army was higher than that of naval officers, because officers in the ar
chased their commissions; but could not they sally thU as well? Officers in the marines, artillery, and en gineers did not purchase, and their half-paywas lger tban that Of officers in the navy, and, moreover, having gone through the Army List, regient by regiment, he had no hesitation in saying that one-half of the officers had not purchased their commissions. It might be objected also that Parliament was unwilling to sanction unnecessary additions to the naval estimates, but surely that would not be caUed an unnecessary charge which was incurzed in doing jutice to ian ill-treated and meritorious body of public servants. He hoped theFirst Lord of the Admiralty would not repeat the ungracious expression which he had used on a formier occasion, that "he did not see any peculiar claims on the part of these old officers." His only object in bringing this subject before the House was to inrease the efficiency of t he navy. By an alteration in the mode of arnra
ing the active list the inactive lst mnight be reducr.
not only would money be saved, but the officers oald be made more contented, they would be enabled to obtain more experience, and be of more valr eto the aervice In the French navy the inactive list was not overloaded as in our service, for it was the practice to keeopretty nearly all the captains afloat. It maight be said t tbe presen;
overloaded state of our list was owing to tho reduction at the *nd of the Last. French war, but at least 600 or 700 offioers had been added during the peace. Ile did not want to interfere with the arrangements of the Government, but he had pointed out a specific grievance and he was prepared to submit to a committee a plan for its remedy. The navy ought to be treated equally as well as the army, for, although inma two year war thenavyhad not had the opportunity of wnnmng many laurels, it should never be forgotten that during a 22 years' war that arm had kept the enemy from our shores and ruled triumphantly upon the ocean. (Hear, hear.) If the Government would give an assurance that they would take the matter into their consideration he would leave it in their hands. It might, perhaps, be that the 7,000 officers for whom he pleaded were'treated unjustly from oversight and not from intention, but, at all events, be knew that redress would not cost more than one of the lsagest sized transports for a single year. He felt that he had done his duty in asking for inquiry, and he hoped that the merits of the officers would weigh with the House, and not the demerits of their advocate. The hon. and gallant gentleman concluded by moving for a select committee to inqmire into the naval administration relating to the lists of ofcers, the patronage, the promotions, and the retirements, and the efliciency of the service in al its grades.
Sir C. WOOD.-My hon. and gallant friend has repeated to-night the motion which he made last session. Ifelt it to be my duty to resist that motion, and the House of Commons agreed with me that it would not be convenient to appoint a committee for such a purpose. I do not see that my hon. and gallant friend has laid before the House any addltional reasons for granting inquiry, and I am therefore relieved from the necessity of troubling them with a long repetition of the arguments which I felt necessary to address to them last year. My hon. and gallant friend really misrepresents the state of the case when he says that every successive Board of Admiralty think things are perfect as they find them and never take the trouble to mkze alterations. I will venture to say that, for the last 15 years-I might go back furtker and say for the last 30 years -therehas ben no nsval administration wxhich has omitted to take some measure or another for the improvement of the condition of officers of the navy. Every successive Board has made some step in that direction, and my hon. and gallant friend will forgive me for saying it is a most unjust accusation which he has made, not only against me, but against the right hon. gentlemen and noble lords who have preceded me, in alleging that the Admiralty have for years neglected the state of the navy. (Hear, hear.) My conviction is that the efficiency of the navy in the late war is attributable to the great improvements which have taken place, in consequence of its not being neglected, and I
elieve that effioiency has been proved and tested in every rank, from the rank of admiral to that of common seaman. (Hear, hear.) My hon. and gallant friend repeats the charge that appointments are influenced by aristocratical and Parliamentary considerations. It is impossible to meet a general accusation of that kind. As far as I am concerned, all I can sav is that, if he wi be so gooda s to state ny one case inWhich I have been unduly swayed by Parliamentary, family, or aristocratical influence, I will franldy meet it; but, in the most unqualified manner, I challenge him to name a single instance. (Hear.) My hon. and gallant friend complains very much of the number of officers unemployed. No doubt it is perfectly true that in the higher ranks there are more officers than canbe employed. It was a subject which occupied the attention of a commission of military and navl officers in 1840, and of a committee of this House in 1848. The course of promotions was checked, and the result has been considerably to diminish the number of officers in the higher ranks unemployed, and to facilitate the promotin or youmger officers, thereby rendering the efficency of th iurrankrs much greter than formerly. Thne argument which m7 hen, and gallant friend has made use of on this occasion Is totally inconsistent with the complaint he generally makes of the want of adequate promotion, b'ecause if you considerably reduce the number of the higher ranks,swhich are obtained by promotion, the inevitable effect must be that promotions must be limitd, and, if that be so, young and deserving offlcers are necessarily deprived of the just reward of their services. My hon. and allant friend complained last session that on the committee of 1848 there was no naval officer. I pointed out that both branches of the service were impartially treated, and no offlcer of the army gat on that commaittee. I am not quite clear that offlcerFs are fit persons to sit upon an inquiry of the kind. But, I remember, seven years before a commission was appointed, consisting prindpally of naval and military officers, for the purpose of investigating this very question, and the recommendations which they made were carried out. The committee of 1848 recommended that there should be considerable means of retirement provided to relieve the active list of a number of officers who were never likely to be employed, and that precess has been going on from day to day. An order in Council, that promotions should be made at the rate of one captain for three who retired, one commander for three who retired, and so on, has been rigidly adhered to, except where great services have been performed. The result is that the captains' and commanders' nsts, although higher in numberthan the committee recommended, are being gradually reduced. It is jperfectly true, although my hon. and gallant friend seems disposed to deny the fact, that a great number of persons who fill the lower ranks of the service were attracted to it by the inordinate promotions at the end of the war. As my as 1,000 lieutenants were gazetted in one year, and I made a calculation that if every one had been employed the last would have been 82 when sent to sea as commander. I need not say more to show tho utter abgurdity of supposing that they could all be employed. The naval members of the commission which sat in 1840 were Sir George Cockburn, Sir Thomas Hardy, and Sir Charles Adams-men well acquainted with and most devoted to the service. I have only stated what those naval officers asserted. They stated:-
" It would be incorrect to attribute the inactivity of these officers entirely to a voluntary relnquishment of duty on their part, as there is no doubt that very many of them would have been fully prepared to serve if opportunities had been afforded to them - but as we have showrn that tbe proportion of the employed to the unemployed is as small as 1 to ll in one class (captains); a 1 to 1O in a second (commandersl; and as I to 6 m the last class (lieutenants), it must be qmte obvious that any full-pay employment must have boem quite out of the reach of a very large number."
The only rule adopted was that which the commisdion recommended-that those who had served as midshipmen and mates, during the war, -who had been in action, or gained medals should receive lieutenancies It was the commission that reported in favour of the long list of lieutenants of which thevon. and gallant gentleman complained. They said:-
" Our examination of the evidence in regard to the rank of ' naval lieutenant ' has led to the conviction that a very large number must be considered as having obtained this commission as a provision from the public for service in an inferior station. They did not, of course, obtain lieutenancies exempted from a liability to be recalled to employment, but to many it must have been apparent that this contingency was remote, and they must have viewed the psition they obtained as the ultimate station ther would hold in the navy. The promotion of more than 1,000 officers to be lieutenants in one year at the close of the last war would in itself furnish a sufficient proof of this."
The oonvenient mode of rewarding these officers and giving them promotion was to make them lieutenants and to give them the half-pay of their rank, without of course a prospect of employment for the greatest portion of that number. It has been calculated that if all these lieutenants had been employed it would have talkenl 40 years before the list would be exhausted, and those at the bottom of the list would have gone to sea as lieutenants at 55 years of age. But it has been proved that where an officer has been so long on shore it is neither for his benefit nor for that of the service that heshould be sent to sea. The scheme for the retirement of the admirals has at least worked this beneficial change, that it has diminished the age of those officers who have attained the rank of admiraL It used to be complained that offlcera were sent to sea of an age that rendered them incompetent to the duties of active service. What was the remedy for that state of things? Why, that a certain number of officers should be placed on the reserved list with the rank and pay of rear-admiral, thereby accelerating the promotion of captains to the rank of admiraL In 1841 the junior admiral had attained the rank of captain 35 years before he attained the rank of admiral. The last admiral, appointed two or three days ago, had served 22 years, and this was a reduction of 13 years in the period of his attaining post rank. The second and thir&vacancy will bringus downto captains who attained that rank 20 years before they attained the rank of admiral. A diminution of several years has thus been effected, and the effect is that we have a number of officers on the admirals' list who are more efficient than they were 20 years ago. My hon. and] gallant friend has referred to the case of the retired commauder who has presented a petition this evening. The comison said,-
"With regard to retirement the commanders have some exclusive ground of cornplaint. They urge that there is no provision in the establishment of Greenwich Hospial for any officers of their rank, and further that there is no re-
redlstfr the seniors of their class similar to the rank of 'retired rear-admiral, as opened to the captains, or to that Iof the retired commander as opeued to the lieutenants. For both of thesegrievances we 5hould consider it expedient thatbredress should be afforded.
'The advantages of Greenwich Hospital shouldbeopened to commanders, as they are to captains and lieutenants; and we; wouldi therefore recommend that four commanders should be added to the establshment of that institution.
"With respect to a rate of reticed pay for commanders, we would suggest to your Majesty that the principle adopted in regard to tne first 100 lieutenants shouldbe applied to the commanders. These 100 lieutenants have the option of retirement as commanders, with the lowest rate of half-pay of that rank-viz., 8s. 6d. a-day. We would recommend that a precisely similar indulgence should be extended to a limited number of the senior commanders; and we should consider that it would be fair to allow 50 of the seniors of that rank the option of receiving the retired rank of captain, with the lowest rate of half-pay allowed to a captain-viz,, 10s. 6d. a-day.
" It is not in our view to reduce the numbers entitled to the half-pay of 10s. a-day as commanders by the proposed boon. We contemplate the in3titution of a class of 50 retired captains, with 10s. 6d. a-day, to be followed by the same number of eommanders-viz, 150 at los. a-day, as are at present allowed."
These are the recommendations of Sir G. Cockburn, Sir T. ELardy, and Sir C. Adams, and they were immediately carried into effeot. Four commanders were added to the establishment of Greenwich Hospital, and 60 oommanders retired with the rank of captain and with the lowest rate of half-pay of a captain. Inx 1851 my right hon. friend (Sir F. Baring) doubled the number of retired commanders, and added 60 to the reserved list, thustrebamgthe number of retired commanders, with the rankof captaiL I thought the commanders would be still more benefited by increasing the number of retirements, and last year I added 150 to the retired listof ommanders and50 tothereserved list. Ithought it desirable, however, that the 50 should not be added at
once, but the result wil be that there will be 250 ret!reci naval commanders, instead of 50, as recommended by the commission, and there will be 100 permanently on the reserved list of commanders. The larger number has been raised to the lOs. 6d. list, and the expense of the whole will
be about 11,000L My hon. and gallant friend then comes to a the ne- cadets who have enteredthe navy. I took the liberty on a previous occasion of stating that the entry of cadets has not been unduly swelled, and that the establishment of mates, midshipmen, -ad cadets is no less than 600 below the establishment: during the war the number was reduced. The nuiber of lieutenants is not above that prescribed by the orders in Council, but at present the complaint is that the ships have plenty of lieutenants but not enough mates. The number of cadetsis con-iderabsly short of what is wvanted at this moment. It must be remembered that a great number quit the service in one way and aKnother. It is not every boy who takes a fancy to the navy who likes the service after he has seen a little of it. The service is said to be unpopular, but I should hardly suppose this to be so from the number of applications made to me, which place me in position of considerable difficulty in deciding upon them. Thecadets who enteredinlS47 were 196, of whom 83 for one reason or another are no longer in the service. I am, therefore, inclined to think that the entries in the navy have been too much restricted, and certainly if another war were to occur we should have a great deficieocy of subordinate officers, without whom it is almost impossible to maintain proper order and discipline. It does not appear tome that my hon. and gallantfriend has shown any ground for the appointment of the committee for which he asks. The questions relative to the reserved list and the retired list were inquired into by a very competent commission, which made recommendations, and the same subjects were referred to a committee of this Honse, under the presidency of the present Dnke of Somerset. The combined system recommended by the commission and the committee has since been fully carried out by the successive Boards of Admiralt, and the result has been the gradual diminution of the of9leers of the higher ranks to the numbers fixed by orders in Council. I do not think any better course could be adopted for the attainment of the object which my hon. and gallant friend seeks to effect, and it does not appear to me that his motion is warranted by any of the grounds he has urged upon the attention of the House.
Mr. W. S. LINDSAY thought the right hon. baronet had failed to make out a case against the appointment of a committee. Although he (Mr. Lindsay) did not believe the present Board of Admiralty were less efficient than their predecessors, and although he knew that the First Ltord of the Admiralty (Sir C. Wood) had been indefatigable in the discharge of hs duties at a period wrhen they were of a very arduous nature, he must say he considered it most objectionable that every change of Administration should involve a change in the Lords of the Addmiralty. That system led to such alterations in the plans of,the department as to occasion a large amount of unnecessary expenditure, and he thought this evil would be avoided if there was a permanent head of the Admiralty. He did not ace why the government of the navy should not be assmilated to that of the army. The Commanderin-Chief of the army held a permanent office; and, although he was subject to the control of the Secretary of State for War, he was mainly respon3ible for the efficiency of the military forces. He (Mr. Lindsay) could not imagine why a permanent officer, who might or might not be a member of the naval profession, should not be placed at the head of the Admiralty to control all nmatters connected with that department. Such an officer might, if the House thought fit, be subject to the control of a First Lord of the Admiralty, or of a Cabinet Minister, in the same manner as the Commander-in-Chief was under the control of the Secretary of State for War. The right hon. baronet (Sir C. Wood) had not explained how it was that in the midst of the late war little more than one-half the number of naval officers on the active list were actually employed. In July, iSn5, there were on the active list 21 full admirals, of whom only one was employed; 27 vice-admirals, of whom two were employed; 51 rear-admirals, of whom 15 were employed. The total number of flag officers on the active list was 99, but only 18 of them were engaged on active aervice. The number of captains on the active list at the
same time was 399, of whom 139 wero epnloyed; com| inanders, 555, of whom 192 were employed - and hieutenants, 1,132, of whom 883 were employed. Ae feared that if during a period of war such a large number of unemployed offlcera remainedupon the active list, theymight see a similar sate of things to that which existed in 1817, soon after the termination of the great continental war, when the House voted 17,000 men for the navy, and there were 5,800 officers upon the active list, or one oficer to every three men. He did not think the House was doing its duty to the country in paying large sums of money to officers who remained inactive, and such a state of thinLs was calculated to excite great discontent among those officers who were unable to obtain employment afloat. It might be difficult to remedy these evils, but in his opinion they were proper subjects for investigation by a committee.
Admiral WALCOTT having last session entered fuly into this question did not think it necessary to do so on the present occasion, but he wonuld mention one circumstance which led to great discontent among naval officers, and which produced on their minds an impression that they were not dealt with fairly and justly. That wa that the First Lord of the Admiralty should have power to distribute employment, to confer promotion, and to recommend officers to the Sovereigu for distinction. He wished tho Board of Admiralty, which was composed princicIly of naval officers, to be made responsible,together with t eir political chief, for the distribution of employment, for promotions, and for recommendations to the Sovereign on account of distinguished services. Without making any reflection on the present First Lord or his predecessors-who were, he believed, actuated by the purest motives in the distribution of their patronage-he contended that that patronage was too enormous to be entrusted to one man. It comprised not only the navy itself, but the marines and a large portion of the civil service. An officerwho distinguishedhimself,andwasselected for an important command, could not be placed in that command unless two or three officers,probably equaUy deserving, were deprived of the opportunity of employment, so that the country lost the services of three efficient officers in order to sewure the services of one. Ee did not wish for a committee if the House did not think proper to appoint one, but he insisted that the naval officers of the Board of Admiralty ought to be made responsible, together with the First Lord, for the distribtion of patronage. Every young offlcer ought to feel, en entering the service, tbat he hvad nothing to depend upon for his advancement but his own efficiency, seal, perseverance, and courage. ("H ]ear, hear," and cries of " Divide 1")1
Captain SCOBELL in reply observed that the orders in Council to which the right hon. gentleman had referred were, in his opinion, unwise. The right hon. gentleman set up the decision of 1841 against that of 1848, but they ought not in 1857 to be bound by the report of any commission of 1841. They should remember, too, that one of the officers upon the commission of 1841, Sir George Cockburn, left at his death a document stating that the Admiralty was too political. A man sometimes had to die before he was able to speak the truth. (A laugh.) The right hon. gentleman had not accounted satisfactorily for the 11,0001. to which he had referred in bringin forward the motion. He had a mass of letters (cries of " Oh Ir" and "Divide ") from officers who had seen 40, 50, and 60 years' service, detailing their grievances, but he wu nild not read them, and he would now leave the matter in thehands of the House.

BRIBERY AT ELECTIONS ACT.
Lord PALMERSTON said, it was understood lst session that, instead of a bill for the renewal of the act to amend the iaws relating to bribery, treating, &c., at elections, the whole subject should be referred to a committee to inquire into the operation of the act, and to ascertain what improvements in it might be made. He therefore moved the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the operation of the act 17th and 18th Victoria, chap. 102, entitled "An act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to bribery, treating, and undue influence at elections of members of Parliament."
Mr. W. WILIAMS was glad the noble lord had brought forward this question. The committee which sat a few years ago agreed to a bil w hich was admitted on all hands to be the most effective measure for the purpose short of the ballot, and he hoped the labours of the proposed committee would prove equally beneficial. There was a great impression abroad that this act was " a pompous profession, meant to be inoperative." So it had been pronounced to be by the great leading journal, and he thought that it was a measure pretty much of that class. He was rejoiced that the noble lord had submitted the subject once more to the consideration of a committee, and he hoped that their labours would end in producing a more effective remedy for the evil.
The motion was then agreed to.
On the motion of Mr. HoRs:%Lt leave was given to bring in the following bils:-Bill to discontinue the taking of tolls on the turnpike roads now existing in Ireland, and t,o provide for the maintenance of such roads as publc roads, and for the discharge of the debts due thereon, and for other purposes; and bill to authorize the payment of clerks of potty sessions in Irelhnd by salaries instead of fees, and to amend the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.

Erratumm.-In the report of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's observations on Monday night he is represented as saying that, according to his estimate of the revenue and expenditure of the years 1858-9 and 1859-60, " after discharging all liabilities, exclusive of the Exohequer-bonds there wil be an excess beyond the expenditure of the last year before the war of about 3,000,01." The error here, though only of a syllable, is important; the word which the right hon. gentleman used was i' inclusive."

The Public Health.
THE PUBLIO .EALTH.
(From the Registrar-General's weekly return.)
The deaths registered in London in the week that'ended on Saturday were 1,264, and exhibit a decrease on tLose or the preceding week, when they were 1,368. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in weeks corre. sponding with last week was 1,135. But, as the deaths in the present return oocurred in an increased population, it is necessary for comparison that the average should be raised in proportion to the increase, in which case it wiU obecome 1,249. The rate of mortality last week was therefore very near the average rate in the second week of February.
The decrease on the previous week, amounting to about 100 deaths, is referable in a principal degree to a diminished mortality from pulmonary diseases. Bronchitis carried oT 224 persons in the previous week; last week the number was 178; pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) was reduced from 96 to 90; phthisis or consumption, from 184 to 172. On the other hand, whoopingeough shows an increase, 61 children having died of it in the previous week, and 70 last week. Measles presents more decided evidence of having been influenced. by cold weather, for the deaths from this complaint, which had risen to 38, again declined to 20. The deaths from smallpox last week were only 3. The mortality from zymotic diseases in the aggregate was not high as compared with the corrected average of corre. sponding weeks, but it wll be seen that whoopingeough was much more fatal than any other disease in that class. Three children died of measles on the 2d and 5th of Febraary in the workhouse, Norwood.
The deaths of six persons (all women, and four of them widows) occurred at ages ranging from 90 to 97 years. The three greatest agges recorded are 94, 96, and 97. Four of these old women died in workhouses.
Last week the births of 947 boys and 904 girls, in all 1,851 children, were registered in London. In the ten cor. responding weeks of tho years 1847-56 the average number was 1,550.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 837in. The highest reading in the week was 30 26 in., and occurred on Thurf day. The mean temperature of the week was 40 9 deg., which is about 9 or 10 deg. higher than that of the two previous weeks, and 2A4 deg. higher than the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher)The highest temperature obtained in the week was 52-2 deg., on Wednesday. The lowest occurred on Friday, and was 31-0 deg. The range of the week was 212 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 35-2 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 657 deg. The wind blew on almost every day from the southwest. The rain measured by the gauge was only ninehundredths of an inch. The horizontal movement of the sir was 220 miles on Monday; only 15 on Saturday.

SIR JOHIN FRANKLINWS E:XPEDITION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-On my arrival in London my attention was called to a letter lately addressed to The A5mes by Captain Sherard Osborn, in which he gives publicity to an anonymous communication from Red River Settlement, wherein it is stated that information, which I kept secret, reached me at Norway-house in July last, from Mr. Anderson (of the late expedition down the Great Fish River), of traces of Sir John Franklin's party having been discovered on tho Back River by Indians. The secretary of the Hudson's Bay Company, in my abeence, pointed out the improbability of this story, and my only object in now troubling youa on the subject is to confirm Mr. Smith's statement, by assuring you that no information of the nature alluded to by Captain Osborn, or of any kind whatever respecting the Franklin expedition, reached me from Mr. Anderson or any other person, at Norway-house, or anywhere else, in the course of the past year, although Mr. Anderson had occasion to address me frequently, his last letter being dated at ths latter end of July.
In order that there may be no roorm for misapprehension on this point I beg to state that no information, bearing in the most remote degree on the Franklin expedition, has ever reached me, directly or indirectly, officially or privately, except that obtained through Dr. Rae in 1854, which was confirmed in 1855 by the expedition under Messrs. Anderson and Stewart to the mouth of the Great Fish River. The reports of those gentlemen were given to the public without one hour of unnecessary delay.
I am, Sir. Your obedient - v -.

Colonel Tulloch's Review Of The Chelsea Report.*
COLO&BL TULLOOPS REBVIEW OF THB
OHBLSEA REPORT.*
THaRD NOTICE.
tuonciuded from 2The Times of Feb. 6.)
Pursuing the case of Mr. Filder, the Chelsea Board dcClare that it was only his dlty to furnish the ration according to the order of the General Commanding. But did he do this? Tn October Lord Raglan strongly urged him to procure vegetables in sufficient quutitiet to preserve the health of the men. How he fulfilled this injunction has already been shown. lord Raglan was also incessant in impressing on him the necessity for extensive issues of fresh meat. We have next to see how he complied with his inatructions in this behalf.
Mr. nilder maintains that the average quantity of fresh meat i5sued from November to March was 101b. per month to each man. But how does he obtain this result? By mixing up the issues to the sick and healthy, and bringing the increased quantity in March to raise the average of the previous months, when the men suffered most from the conitinued use of salt meat. Disentangling this confusion and taking other deductions into account, what is the 101b. a-month reduced to for both sick and healthy, the sick very properly having had the preference ?
" A surgeon of the 4th Dragoon Guards says in his evidence to the Commissioners that,-
**During part of November the sicx received fresh meat o.casionatty, but in December they had nothing but salt meat Liii the 2Sth In January the sick had fresh meat 20 days, in February 12 days; on some of the days on which frsh meat wras issued the quantity was not sutfcient for the tdluirements of thcHospital.'
-The surgeon of the 49th Regiment also States-
'-*In the month of December therc were 14 days during which no fresh meat could be got for the sick, either from the comst or the purveyor.'
It must also be inferred from lMr. Filder's letter to Mx. Peel that the British soldier received, during the three months referred to, more fresh meat than the French soldier, but this inference is also incorrect. Mr. Filder compares the whole quanutity i8sued to the British army, inclzuding tho sick (who, as he admits, got much the larger sbare of what was supplied), with the quantity issued to the French troops, exclusire of what was required for the sick. Ten ounces every three days, or 641b. par month, vwas the quantity issued to the healthy French soldier as his ration of fresh meat. The corresponding quantity received by the healthy British soldier of the five
ivisions of infantry during the months of December, January, and February was, on the average, only about 41T. per month, as stated in the Commissioners' report."
What were the grounds for limiting the scurvystiicken soldier to about 121b. of fresh meat in three months ? We must attend to the alleged grounds, for they are very remarkable. In the first place, Mr. Filder was apprehensive of exhausting the resources of Turkey. We now know by experience that nearly three times the force employed during the first winter in the Crimea has since been supported there chiefly on fresh provisions. But, putting aside conjecture, there were " available in depot in the beginning of the winter of 1854 about 8,0GO head of cattle." Of these less than lhalf were brought over in the three months, though the tenders Mfr. Filder rejected in one of these months would have almost replaced the entire 8,000, and though the tenders he did accept left him in April with 7,500 on hand, or very nearly the same quantity he had at the beginning of winter. So far from exhausting the resources of Turkey, he had more cattle than he knew what to do -with. The loss of an extra thousand in transit, to which he attributed great importance, would never have been felt. This loss would have been quite ridiculous when compared with the resources of Tuxley.
We have mentioned above certain rejected tenders. Why were these tenders rejected, when a more liberal supply of fresh meat would have saved the lves of thousanuds? Mr. Filder declares "the question of expense was never taken into consideration." But on this point his own official returns contradict him, and the contradiction is made remorselessly patent by Colonel TuUoch. The Board countenanced the misstatement, though possessed of the contradictory evidence, and the Board must now share the discredit of its refutation. If we allow that the tenders were rejected for another and an adequate reason,-that Mr. Filder had "plenty of cattle at Constantinople," then why did this "plenty" reach the troops at the rate of only 41b. per month ? The soldiers were perishing by thousands from disease produced by the use of salt meat. During December, January, and February there was almost a total absence of fresh meat, and even the sick were for many days-nay, even for weeks-fed exclusively on salt meat, which in their state was poison. Why, then, this reckless waste of life, and what reason can be given for this great stain, " which might almost be termed an outrage on humanity ?" Land transport was the chief difficulty in the Crimea, but live cattle once landed would have transported themselves-nay, they would have set at liberty the mules and horses required to carry up the salt meat in their place. Mr. Filder, therefore, and the excusing Board lay primary stress on the want of sea transport, but Colonel Tulloch thus sweeps this last excuse into the Euxine.
In laying such stress on the want of sea transport the Board left out of view the evidence of Colonel Gordon, that " a large number of horse sailing transports were placed at the disposal of the Comimissariat on the 28th of October, and from a list produced, showing the distribution of these transports on the 19th of November, it appears that *16 of them were then empty and available for Commissariat puqposes." These vessels lay idle during the winter, while the troops were perishing for want of fresh meat. If the Board observed, without commenting on, this circumstance, it must be presumed that they concurred in Mr. Filder's reasons for not employing such vessels; that they also thought "sailin" vessels unsuitable for the service," and knew " of no large army that has at any former time been dependent upon supplies brought by sea in sailing vessels." The Board, however, might have remembered that at no remote period there were no other means of sea transport for cattle but these. Several of its members had shared in the Peninsular campaign, and might bave had personal knowledge of the fact " that when the army lay withini the lines of Torres Vedras it was in a great measure supported by cattle brought from the north of Spain in sailing vessels-a much more tedious, difficult, and dangerous voyage than any between the shores of Turkey and Balaklava." The despatches of the Duke are most particular upon this point. He is solicitous for fresh meat, because he has already " begun to give the British arnmy salt provisions ttvo dayjs in the 'week." Therefore he orders cattle to be despatched to him iui horse tramsports, the very vessels to the use of which Mr. Filder raised so many objections. Instead of being deterred by the advance of wvinter and the tempestuous weather, or being apprehensive of exhausting the resources of the country, he keeps increasing his supply of cattle as the winter goes on, and he preserves probably by this very means for their responsible functions at Chelsea certain of the seven Generals who are now unable to recall the circumstance, who either concurred with Mr. Filder in his ignorance that any large army had at any former time been dependent upon supplies brought by sea iu sailing vessels, or who, if they remembered the circumustance, ignored its bearinas in a spirit which it is quite superfluous to characterize.
We thus leave the question of fresh meat, passing over the possibility of buying up killed meat, and which Colonel Tulloch discusses, to come to the question of lim'ejuice, which involves further discredit to the Board, and heaps even a larger measure of contempt upon their proceedings. The Commissioners had pointed out that while the s -ffariuf ot
army Were probably at their height there was limejuice lying in the Commissariat stores at Balaklava from the I 0th of December, and this limejuice was not issued till the first week in Februay. The Board (we abstain from repeating the alternative inference) protected the living at the expense of the dead, and cast the blame of this omission, "w which forms undoubtedly one of the greatest blots in the history of the war," upon Lord Raglan. Lord Raglan, they say, " appears to have been duly informed that there was limejuice in store," and " in this iratter no blame seems to attach to the Commissary-GeneraL" Colonel
Tulloch approaches this niscariage as a painful subject, and painful it Is in many senses, with humiliation superadded.
If Lord Raglan really knew that 20,O001b. of limejuice was lying in the store unused, at a time when its isue was essential to the health of his men, his memory would asuredly little deaerve that high conszideration which it bas up to the lst

r4oment received from all his critics. But how stands the fact? Mr. Filder's own examination
condemns himself, and it also condemns the Board, I who excused him directly in the teeth of his own evidence.
W1 Was the General Commanding-in-Chief informed of the arrival of this ]imejuice?
"No. Stores belonging to another department we informed the proper officer of.
Then, you informed the Medical Department?t
*Yes. I have a certifioate here that I will read."
But Mr. Filder, instead of reading a certificate, quoted a letter from one of his subordinate officers alleging that verbal intimation was given to Purveyor Jenner, &c., and the only way in which he connects Lord Raglan with the subject is in the following statement on the same query:-
"After the 22d of January we used to furnish Lord! Baglan with a statement of aU the stores in our possession of every kind, and it was not til the 29th of January that
he gave me an order to begin the issue.' I
His return was really made up on the 24th, and I thus for the first time Lord Raglan knew the fact
that the limejuice, for the want of which his army I was melting away, had been lying for five or six weeks in the Commissariat stores. Only two days after this fact came to his knowledge he was discussing through official channels the proper mode of using it, and on the 29th the General Order appeared, under which it was issued as part of the daily ration. "In fact, instead of Lord Raglan having been cognizant of the delay, it is more than probable that, but for his calling for the returns in question, the limejuice would have remained in store til he no longer had an army to use it."
Some further hypotheses on the subject of limejuice are perfectly immaterial, as Colonel Tulloch scatters them to the winds; so we make our way to the subject of fres1h bread. The Commnissioners had charged Mr. Filder with an indisposition to make the attempt of baking fresh bread, to which he replied, in the opinion of the Board, "satisfactoriy." The endeavours which were thus "satisfactory" may be stated in brief compass. Mvr. Filder in the beginning of winter purchased a three-months' supply of flour for the purpose, but during more than half a year he abstained from converting this flour into bread. Had the Ordnance considered it sufficient to provide cloth for greatcoats or wool for blankets, though neither greatcoats nor blankets were manufactured therefrom, the Ordnance might have given equal satisfaction to the Chelsea judges. Mr. Filder had appliedfor a floating mill and bakery, which did not arrive from England till May, and which, when they did arrive, were found quite inadequate to the demand, and on this distant prospect Mr. Filder dwelt serenely. In the meantime the troops suffered, but no attempt was made to construct the ovens, which, after all, had to be constructed when the floating mill and bakery failed. The want of bread during the winter fell with very great severity upon the sick, particularly those suffering from scurvy, whose gums were in such a state that they could not use biscuit, and whose longing for fresh bread is described as being incessant. If there was really a difficulty in transport, as is alleged, even for so limited a quantity, surely as many animals might have been devoted to that purpose as were found necessary for an equal weight of biscuit, which few of the sick could use. But considerations of transport were not very material, for even the sick in the hospitals at Balaklava received no bread, though during the greater part of the winter it was baked in abundance within a few hundred yards of them for all who were rich enough to pay for it at the rate of Is. per lb. As regards these men, it was certainly not a question of transport. We should add that there were old Russian ovens at Balaklava capable, asthe event proved, of turning out nearly 3,000 loaves per day, and which merely required to be cleared out to make them available. lf the few bakers requisite could not have been supplied from the army, bakers could have been imported from Malta or Scutari in the month of November as easily as in the month of May. Yet up to the 9th of April not a morsel of bread was issued even to the sick, though Mr. Filder in his evidence before the Board admits that it was repeatedly applied for.
When Sir John McNeill and Colonel Tulloch arrived at Balaklava, on the 12th of March, they were so impressed with the urgency of supplying this want that they themselves immediately set about the erection of ovens, under the circumstances stated in the appendix to their report. These ovens ought to have produced 8,8321b. of bread daily; but after they were given over to Mr. Filder they only produced between one-third and one-half of that quantity. Had they;been erected earlier, and had their capacities been properly worked, these and two more of similar size would have admitted of bread being issued for the whole army every second day during the winter, merely by the employment of 12 men acquainted with baking -a number which there is little doubt might have been found among the Scotch regiments at Balaklava alone. Were any further evidence wanting of the indisposition to make bread, it might be found in the correspondence and memorandum by Colonel Tulloch on that subject, where it will be seen that, though, in order to remove all difficulties with regard to ovens, he offered on the 15th of March to superintend the building of the two above mentioned, so many difficulties were thrown in the way of his obtaining the requisite materials and assistance that after a fortnight's delay he was actually obliged to obtain an order for the fire bricks required under Lord Raglan's own hand. On the 31st of that month Sir John M'Neill intimated to Mr. Filder the necessity for bringtin over bakers to work these ovens, as objections had been urged by the military authorities to men being, employed from the army; but even after this it was not till the 18th of April that bakers were sent for. Nearly another month elapsed before they arrived at Constantinople, and the ovens were only brought into use on the l9th of May, and then not till the Scotch regiments at Kadikoi, seeing them remain so long idle, were making preparations to use them on their own account. The other ovens already existing in Balaklava were only brought into use on the Commissioners representing that the gentleman charged with the administration of The Ties Fund was about to supply the deficiency in some of the principal hospitals. Then the discredit of having this effected from a private source apparently brought about the desired improvement; and, under these circumstances, viewed as a consistent whole, the Commissioners charged Mr. Filder with an indisposition to make bread. Under these circumstances, moreover, the unexacting Board took their portion of the responsibility by releasing him from the iLiputation.
With respect to the memorable green coffee which was so bitterly complained of by the soldiers, the Board have partly made incorrect statements and partly fallacious inferences, and both with the same tendency to exculpate llir. Filder. They say he was in no way responsible for the coffee not being roasted, when there is evidence to show tbat it was sent out raw at his special request, and this though the difficulty attending such an arra-ngement was distinctly pointed out to him. He had even stated in his note to Mr. Grant, " The soldiers will
no doubt find some means of overcoming any difficulty that may arise from the want of mills and coffee-roasters," and when Mr. Grant suggested mills for grinding the coffee six smaZU coffee-miUs only were directed to be sent out to him. A military board, held at Varnue, had, it is true, decided on issuing coffee in its green state to the troops, but Mr. Filder and the Board have kent out of sight the important distinction that this took place during summer, in a country where wood was abundant and the soldiers had plenty of leisure. But in the Crimea they could only procure fuel by digging roots from ground covered with snow and ice,which their previous duties in the trenches scarcely left them strength to accomplish. In November, accordingly, the men began to complain of their unreasonable and unfeeling treatment by the Commissariat in respect of their coffee. But Mr. Filder neither causedthecoffee tobe roastednor ground, becauseitwas not ordered; andthus declinedtofulfiltheresponsibilitiesofhishighposition by exercising any option of his own, nor did he relieve himself of these responsibilities by requesting Lord Raglan's authority to have the coffee prepared at Constantinople or Balsklava, or for procuring and issuing teainstead. Accordingto his own showing he allowed the men to suffer under this priva tion from the beginning of November till the end of
.J anuary; whfie the Bowad appended this obvious untruth to his explanation, that "fuel u d have bee, u&iQUrAY required for mkng the teaI, the roast. in zwell as the nmk:ng of the ooffee bem, I in quews
tion. We call this an untruth but ithas an dter-
native title, and rnay be simply a stupid insult to the common sense of their countrymen.
On the subject of fuel theBoard displayed a further equivocating talent. The Commissioners blamed Mr. Filder for want of alacrihj in providing it, and the Board excused him from any wantt offoresight in this respect, a want which Colonel Tulloch contends was never imputed to him. His foresight he had shown in storing up a supply at Balaldava, but his want of alacrity he displayedinnot issuing it. Againandagain did Lord llaglan press him to commence the issue of fuel. He appears to have been still under the delusive apprehension of exhausting his stock, though there was no difficulty in procuring firewood from the shores of the Black ea. He even remonstrated with Lord Raglan for requiring him to supply fael at al, referring as usual to Peninsular precedents, and this time, we assume, stating the facts correctly. At all events he justified the imputation of a want of alacrity, which the Board slurredover, with respect to which they took the equivocal course of neither admitting nor denying it, while excusing Mr. Filder from charges which were never mnade, and so leaving the impression that he had been wronged by the Comrnissioners.
From this point we follow the Board through theirlat doubie, and pursue them and their Crimean protdgts to their last retreat. The key of their position-their petty Malakhoff-is the difficulty of procuringland transport,becauseMr.Filderwas not supp lied with presed hay from England. Any real difficulties on this score must be accounted for by the department here; the sham consequences have been thus thoroughly disposed of by Colonel Tulloch. Pressed hay from England at close upon 2d. per lb. would doubtless have been usefuL In the meantime chopped straw at about one farthing per lb. might have been had from the Bosphorus, aud, combined with barley, would have fed the animals, not perhaps according to Peninsular precedents, but " as is the custom all over the East." Mr. Filder was aware that abundance of chopped straw could be procured, but he contends that in anunpressed state a vessel could only carry a quantity equal to about one-tenth of her tonnage, and therefore it was inexpedient toprovide this species of forage (althoughsome species of forage was the assumed linch-pin of the Crimean expedition), and thus he waited till the gods should annihilate both tnne and space, and make him happy by the arrival of pressed hay from England. While he. was waiting, like Mr. Micawber, for the pressed hay to turn up, it never seems to have occurred to him that, during the winter, in addition to other disposable sailing, vessels, he had still his 16 large transports lying perfectly idle. If, from the apprehension of loss, he thought these transports unfit to carry cattle, the percentage ci chopped straw which would have suffered from seasickness would not have been considerable. re had 2,000 baggage animals in dep6t at Constantinople, and they cost him at the rate of about 8d. a-day each; in fact, their keep by the end of November had cost more than their value. A simple person, provided he was not a member of the Chelsea Board, would have thought it economy to turn the idle horses, and the idle transports to a mutual profit. He would probably, by the way, have saved thousands of heroic hearts, have upheld the honour of his country, and changed the whole tenour of one of its historic eforts; but if, with his simpler end in view, to be accomplished by the simDlest means, he had solely had regard to the economies of his department, this simple person, to attain his object, must have been lees simple than Nr. Filder.
For the Board, equally simple, which unhesitatingly approved his arrangements, Colonel Tulloch exemplifies the working of the opposite system. It will scarcely be denied, says he, that an addition even of 500 baggage animals beyond what were brought over, would by doubling the available transp rt in the beginning of the winter of 1854, have prevented the most serious of the evils from which the troops subsequently suffered. A couple of transports might have brought them over, with barley and straw sufficient for the voyage, and a considerable surplus of the formner would have been left for future* use. To keep up the ncoessary supply after they were landed two other sailing transports would have sufficed on Mr. Fildres own calmWion. The small size of the harbour to which Mr. Filder elsewhere alludes could have been no obstacle to this operation, for it was just as limited in extent at the end of the following year, when! nearly thrice the number of troops and ten times as many baggage animals were abundantly suppliedK through the very same channel. Thus " the deficiency of forage to which (the Board assert that) step by step all other deficiencies were mainly attributable" could have been easily supplied. The forage would have fedI the baggage anmals, the baggage animals would have transported to the front food and clothing, medicines, and comforts; frost, famine, and pestilence would have retreated from their prey, and an ample army would still have answered to their rollcaUl, on the Board's deliberate admission, if only Mr. Filder, or somebody behind him, had taken the first necessary step in the sequence. This is the case of the Board at its very best, and the world will judge how far it exonerates Mr. Filder, now that the means at his disposal are thus thoroughly known.
Even the deficiency of land transport, to whomsoever attributable, had little to do with the supply of salt meat instead of fresh, of biscuit instead of bread, of green in the place of roasted coffee, and with the omission to commuuaicate the arrival of lime juice to the proper authorities. Therefore the case of the Commissioners even against Mr. Filder does not fail if the exploded case of the Board were fully sustainable. Still less is deficiency of transport answerable for the starvation of Lord Cardigan's horses, for the exposure of Lord Lucan's, and the sacrifice of both ; for Sir Richard Airey's forgetfulness of the knapsacks and squadbags; for the horse nosebags left in the Jason, and the horse medicines in the Medway; for the delays and objections to issuing 'the coatees, and for Colonel Gordon's hesitation between rugs and blankets; it accounts for the neglect of no available precaution when the troops were shivering, starving, rotting, and dying in sight of preservatives and in the presence of succour.
To know the full measure of these enormities we must gauge their consequences, and for this we have for the first time accurate data at our disposaL Towards the end of his volame Colonel Tulloch produces a summary of information collected by Sir John M'Neill and himself relative to the sickness, mortality, and prevailing diseases among the troops, information which they could not include in their report, and which now comes to add a terrible sanction to its conclusions. The aggregate loss from sickness alone, in seven months, discloses the general dimensions of the horror, but a careful] analysis indicates its true sources:
"That it could not have been in any important degree the result of climate must be inferred from the circumstance of this loss having occurred in a country which, by the concurrent testimony of nearly all the medical officers. as well as the experience of the following year, appears to have been almost as healthy as Great Bntain, except, perlips, as regards cholera.
uOat of about 10,000 men who died during these seven months, belonging to the Crimean army, only 1,200 were cut off by that epidemic;* the remainder perished by no fe man's hand, no blast of pestilence, but from the slow though sure operation of disease, produced by causes most of which appeared capable, at least, of mitigation.
" Compared with this, the mortality in our army on all
previous occasions sinks into compaative insignficance even that of Walcheren, which threw the nation into mourning, and for years convulsed our senate, did not exceed a fourth part of the average her recorded. Armies have perished by the sword-they have been overwhelmed by the elements, but never, perhaps, since the hand of the Lord smote the Host of the Assyrianus, and they perished in a night, has such a loss from disease been recorded as on this occasion.
" With the graves of 10,000 of their countrymen before their eyes, with the mouldermg remains of Britain's choicest cavy beneath their feet, and with an overwhelming mass of evidence in their possession, to show how much of this loss might have been averted by a proper application of the supplies, could the Commissioners be expected to arrive at the conclusion of the Board of General Officers, that for all this no one in the Crimea was toblame 2"
The Commissioners, indeed, analyzed these awful records of mortality, and found them to contain, among others, these significant differences. While the losses in the Naval Brigade, -which took a prominent part in the operations of the siege, were under 4 per cent., the average lous of infantry, as roughly estimated in the Commissioners' Report, was as much as 39 per cent.; and again, as compared with the latter, the losz of offioers, of all arms, was only 6 per cent. According to the dates of arrival, the logses in diferent corps varied in the scaleof destructionfrom to 73 per cent., and in one cue in different portions of the same regiment which equally faced the perils of the winter the difference from a different treatment was 28 per cent.; orb the one nid the loss was 2 per cent.,
and on the other it tas30 per cent. Grant thattheirrespective duties to some extent account for this, to vhat was the excessive pressure of duties attribatable? To the fact that at onetime the sick in hospitat and at Scutari considerably exceeded the force fit for any duty, that the army had melted away like a snow wreath, and that folly and incompetence, by ummistakeable agencies, had accomplished half the havoc in the host of Sennacherib.
Into this horrible scandal Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch were commissioned to inquire, and they did inquire without fear or favour. Nor did they hesitate to expose the culprits whom they found red-handed, yet complacent, supercilious, and even insolent. With a caln indifference to such manifestations they graTely set down the truth and earned the eternal gratitude of their country, with the petty hostility of the delinquents whom they marked out for disgrace. But no public motion testified to their services; no public honour or recompense awaited them. Honours and rewards were reserved exclusively for the men to whom they hadtraced the destruction of a noble army. It may even be said that they were the sufferers by their successful labours, and that for their honest dealing they were marked men themselves. The Premier has laid it down that it would not have been fair to promote Colonel Tulloch over the heads of senior officers who had distinguished themselves by actual service in the field, but in the meantime junior officers have been promot;d over his head without such service, or without any service which could at all compete with his. Colonel Randall Rumley, 123 below him on the list of Colonels, and who was never in the Crimea, but who simply commanded a portion of the depets at Malta, has been thus promoted to the rank of Major-GeneraL Colonel Henry Storks, 124 below him on the same list, and who also did not serve in the Crimea, but who for a few months had eharge of a hospital at Smyrna, and afterwards was Commandant at Scutari, has been thus promoted to the rank of K.C.B. Both these officershave marched over Colonel Tulloch's head, as if to mark the penalty of serving one's country too faithfully, and at the same time to contradict the latest theory of promotion. In the meantime the chief delinquents, now proved responsible for the wholesale destruction of England's choicest troops, have been more favoured and fortunate still. Not only have they been rewarded, as men may hope to be rewarded who succeed to the satisfaction of the Horse Guards in sacrificing an army, but they have been furnished with sponsors for their shame whom the public will now accept. The Board, which was introduced to redistribute their ignominy, in one sense at least has accomplished its purpose, for it has taken the burden on its own shoulders, where it is now fixed for ever by this reply of Colonel Tulloch. At the same time we must recur to the position of Colonel Tulloch himself, who, with Sir John M'Neill, has conduced to arrangements so satisfactory to all parties. These gentlemen alone have received no reward, though, in addition to the favours they have been the means of conferring on everybody else, " they performed their duty entirely to the satisfaction of Her Majesty's Government and very much to their own credit,-with great ability, great perseverance, and great minuteness of research ;" and though they made a report which " was very useful to Her Majesty's Government in preventing a recurrence of such unfortunate events as had caused their being sent out." Though they have thus an acknowleged claim on Her Majesty's Government, on the army, and on the nation, to whom as well as to the Government the preservation of its army from " unfortunate events " is important -though theyhave established afurtherclaim on the gratitude of their countrymen by the simple tenacity which would not permit their faithful service to be faithlessly set aside, it is now contended in the face of the English Commons that their service does not require any " extraordinary recognition." Extraordinay recognitions, it appears, are reserved for the authors of calamities of extraordinary dimensions. Extraordinary bunglers or culprits obtain extraordinary rewards. But some ordinary acknowledgment is at least expected here, or, if it is withheld covertly but advisedly, the public has a right to know why and by whom. This is not a question on which to mince words, for it is a question of the miscarriage of justice; it is a question identified with the credit of the Government, the honour of the Crown, and the interests of the army; and it is a question now confided to the Commons of England.
Another Meeting Of The "Unemployed" At
ANOTTER MEETING OF THE C "UNEMLOYD" AT S5IrrERLD.-Yesterday the unfortunate men who are at present suffering from want of employment were induced to assemble in large numbers at their usual place of rendez. vous by an invitation from Mr. Ernest Jones, who promnised that if they would meet him there he would tell them " how to obtain relief now, and how to become independent of it very soon." Mr. Jones accordingly addressed some 2,000 or 3,000 persons, a great many of whom, however evidently did not belong to the " unemployed," in his usual strain of invective against the present holders of property and depositaries of power. He declared that the existing want of employment aroso from permanent, and not from temporary causes. The wells were not frozen, but were dried up, and theymust dig deeperif they wishedagain to openthe sourcesof labour and ofgprospertyforthepeople. Re ascribed the suspension of the building trade to the national debt, which hadimpoverished many and earichod a few. Capital was withdrawn from other trades and invested in building, because those who by usury had suddenly become rich were not content to live at their warehouses in the city, but must have fine boxes and splendid villas in the suburbs. Bet that systemhad run its course. Newhouses were no longer wanted, while many that were already built were untenanted, and hence non-employment in that trade. Large numbers of men being thus thrown out of work the labour-market became overstocked, and the natural consequence was a faU of -wages, the masters in other trades playing off those who were out of work against those who were in work. Another cause why surplus labour now oppressed the people arose from tho fact that the system of railways had ran its tether. The great extension of railways caUed many thousands of persons into the iron trade, but their labour was now no longer required, and those who had been withdrawn from agricultural pursuits to the iron trade could not fall back upon the land, for that resource was closed against them. Again, the price of cotton had been raised - the United States and many countries on the continent of Europe had become manufacturers of cotton goods, and the only means the English manufacturers had to meet this competition was to reduce wages. This being the state of tbings, the cry of the Deople was-" Where shall we go? What shall we do to liier 7 e would tell them. They had not yet taken one step to better their condition. Emigration, workhouse rehef, and a national subscription had been recommended to them; but emigration was impracticable, workhouse rehef was msulting and degrading,while a subscripton was in its nature onlytemporary, and what they reqnired was some permanent remedy for the evils they were enarnng. The only good thing recommended to them by the " Association' which had undertaken to advise them was the cultivation of the waste lands of England, and that was a plan he himself suggested 10 years ago. There were 30,000,000 acres of land in this country which had never felt the touch of plough or spade, 20,000,000 of which were good average land and canable of tiUlage. But how were they to obtain possession of it? They were advised to petition Parliament, but Parhament consisted of the very men wbo owned the land, and whose interest it was that no more acres should be brought into cultivation, for that would cheapen food, and cheap food would reduce rents, and the landowners needed high rents to pay the fLxed charges on their property, nearly al of which was heavily burdened with mortgages and other charges. What, then, were they to do ? They must obtain a Parlia. ment of their own, and that could only be achieved by universal suffrage. Let them rally, then, around him, and go for the People's Charter. He would lead them. When they had once obtained Parliamentary power his plan would be to create out of the unemployed 1,000,000 independent farmers by settling them on the wasto land. These farmers, so created, would require cottages and clothing, and thus would be absorbed the labour of all the bricklayers, the masons, the carpenters, the shoemakers, the tailors, and other trades who were now raising the cry, "Where shall we go ? What shall we do to live " Agitation had obtained for the middling classes a reduction of the incometax; let the working classes weld themselves together, and then Parliament would see what millions of stout hearts, ledby honest and inteligent minds, could achieve. (Cheers.)
ones continued this mode of address for upwards of an hour, and in th course of it he on two or three occasions caled for a show of hands in confirmation of the doctrines
hewas endeavouring to inculcate. He declared his present object to be to warn the Government and the Parliament. If they conceded teo vwast lands to the working classes he w d retire into private life, and all itation should cease; but if they disregarded the just claims of the suffering millions, then he would come forward and aid in tho formtion o a mighty political organization, whose demands neither Parliament nor Government would be able to resist. At te close of his speech Mr. Jones hurriedly retired, and tdhejenFepie quietly dispersed, without having at any period
duigthe address evinced any3strong feeling of zeal or ebarrnestnhess in favour of the arguments which had been put

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE DITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As a father, upon vhom has fallen a calamity tho moat distressing to contemplate I wrosld appeal to your aympathies to be permitted to correo.t in aome material points your report of this day of my evidence at the MansionhOUC in oonnexion with the robbery of my cashbox from the Indie house.
It publishes that I stated after my boy bad absented himself a woek I communicated my uspciCons to the secretary, whereas I said that when I mised my csahbox I communi. e ted the fact to the deputy-secretary.
The report further states tkat the cash was the property of the East India Compauy. Permit me to correot this also, as the box, with its contents, was my own personal property.
I feel asured that you wii do me the jwtice of correct. ing these mistakes, and not place my name before the public in a more degradig position than the necessities of the cae reqmir.
it is a bitter reflection that after BtmgUng 30 years with a family, having an earnest dedre to nurture them in habits of religion, morality, and every virtue tending to advance their proeperity, giving them example and preeept as their guide, that my name, which has paed mny geneations unblemished, ahould now be criminally Identifed; but this is the enly solace-jf it can be called solace-in the midst o my deep tribulation, that my child has robbed me, and not myt emuployers.
With many apologies,
I ~~~~~~I amn. YPir vonar nh.,i.,di ....,

I LONDON, WElDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 18S7.
In the Holise of Lords last night,
The Earl of GA2vmLE,, in reply to Lord C- 1 NA11YON, stated that there was no truth in the I eport that Atimiral SE2MOup1 at the date of the last advices had commenced throwing red hot shot into I Canton.
The LoBD CnHcAaoR intimated his iatention to
bring in, in a short time, seven bills for consoli. dating the criminal statutes.
Lord BRoVnGH r declared that the only way to obtain a digest of the common law which should obtain Parlamentary sanction was to confide the task to experienced legal hands, and, when that task was finished, that Parliament should accept the result of their labours without any attempt at alteration.
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons,
MIr. M'MAouN, in moving for leave to introduce bils to assimilate the law a to the sea-coast fisheries of Ireland to that of England, regretted that a subject of so much importance, which was as much an English as an Irish question, had not been taken up by the Government. He recited provisions of the existing law which showed its unequal pressure upon the Irish fisheries in comparison with those of England and Scotland, pointing out what he considered to be the absurdity as well as the gross injustice of those provisions. No Power in the world, he said, possessed so many capabilities for prosecuting this species of industry as the Irish.
Mr. HoRs3rAa said if the measure proposed to be introduced was identical with the bill of 1855,which was rejected by the House, he could not advise its adoption.
After a short discussion leave was given.
Captain SCOBBLL moved for a select comr4ittee to inquire into the naval administration relating to the lists of officers, the patronage, the promotions, the retirements, and the efficiency of the service in all its grades. He observed that all he asked for was inquiry ; that he attacked not this or that administration, but the system, and that his object was a mild administrative reform. Ho went into many details to show that there were grounds for inquiry, and in anticipation of objections. He pledged himself to produce before the committee a better plan than the present.
Sir C. WOOD said this was only a repetition of a motion made last session, when the House thought it inexpedient to appoint a committee, no additional grounds having been now laid for such an inquiry. To improve the condition of the officers of the navy, he observed, had been the object of successiveBoards of Admiralty for years past, and he taxed Captain ScOBnLL with error and misrepresentation, appealing in hisreply to official reports and returns. The whole question, he added, bad already undergone full investigation before a committee of that House.
Mr. W. S. LINDSAY supported the motion. He suggested, among other questions fit for inquiry, whether there should not be a permanent head of the Admiralty, who might control all matters connected with that department in the same manner as the Commander-in-Chief controlled the army.
Admiral WALCOTT said the naval profession were dissatisfied, considerina that their claims were not fairly dealt with, and they objected to such vast power and patronage being vested in the First Lord of the Admiralty.
Captain SCOBELL replied, and upon a division the motion was negatived by 97 to 76.
Lord PAL)mRSTON moved for a select committee to inquire into the operation of the act the 17th and 18th of VICTORIA, chap. 102, to consolidate and amend the laws relating to bribery, treating, and undne influence at elections of members of Parliament.
The motion, after some remarks by Mr. W. WiLLIASs and Miir. H. BIERKELEY, was agreed to.
MIr. Honss3rA obtained leave to bring in a bill to discontinue the taking of toll on the turnpike roads now existing in Ireland, and to provide for the maintenance of such roads as public roads, and for the discharge of the debts due thereon, and for other purposes; and
Mr. BOUVERIE a bill to provide for the relief of the poor in extraparochial places.
The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to.
The Royal Marine Forces Bill was read a third time and passed.
The House adjourned at 25 minutes to 8 o'clock.
There are diseases of infancy as well as of man-
There are diseases of infancy as well as of manhood. Accordingly, every session is regularly attacked with a succession of infantile ailments from the very day of the opening. As they say the strongest children are most liable to the croup, so the most vigorous and promising Legislature is apt to find itself suddenly strangled into silence. For the two last nights the interesting babe, with the greatest inclination to make itself heard, and struggling to alarm the whole nation with its cries, has been in silent agony. One could hardly believe there was a Parliament sitting. Tle only sound that came from the legislative nursery was a low murmur that mig,ht denote, perhaps satisfaction, perhaps the contrary. A stranger might not know whether the result of the last two nights was a " cross" or a deadly defiance. Both evenings the House was broken up long before 9, with only a few questions put and answered. The real account of the matter is to be found. in a superabundance of energy, which, somehow, cannot develope itself. Both Mr. DISRAPI, and Mr. GnADSTONE started this session with an immense desire to do something notable, and to constitute themselves the principal personages of the House. They had crammed themselves with figures, whether of rhetoric or arithmetic, till they were " chuck full," as the saying is. But the occasion was denied them. Full many a flower is not even born, and never gets so far as to blush, seen or unseen; and at this moment several very splendid orations against the war duties and the War Income-tax are slowly floating down the stream of Lethe, with other bulky refuse. Perhaps they are gone to the place the approach to wbich is said to be paved with good intentions, but they will never see the light. MIany midnight hours, many sheets of foolscap, have been wasted upon them; for, as old HoIim says of some youthful victim of war, they survive not to repay the good offices of their parents. So, when the CHANCELLO of the EXCHEQUER, with the most barbarous disrespect for the feelings of bis antagonists, gave up the war ninepence without letting it be fought for, what was to be done? Yes, what was to be done ? What a simple question! Nothing easier. The same speeches, with the slightest possible change, would do in favour of the Income-tax, or, what is the same thing, in favour of securing, at all events, a full treasury two years or four years to come. As there was nothing to be done for the present year, it only remained to have a battle about the year after and the year 1860. First the cry was, " You're not going to " keep on the War Income-tax, are you g" The next cry was, " You can't do without the War Income" tax, can you?" There arose, however, a new difficulty. These gentlemen had peremptorily demanded that the Budget should be fluni on the table of the House, finished or not finishcd, at the earliest possible day, without waiting for the completion of the Estimates. Well, the Budget was produced, and the Estimates also, in rather a rude state. The same gentlemen then whose change of tactics we have already mentioned with honour changed their line on this point also. Having obtained the Budget, they demanded that the Estimates should be deferred, lest the Estimates should commit them past repentance. A sudden terror had seized their minds that by surrendering the War Income-tax the nation would find itself bankrupt in 1858 or 1860. So this point too was conceded them, and they are to have a day for considering everything together, just as a child, after first putting down one thing, then another, finally determines that it may hold them both for a time before it makes the fatal decision. Such is the explanation of the almost alarming reticence of the Opposition on the Budget. They. do not know what to be at, and -vill neither have one thing nor the other-neither a full exchequer nor a low one.
But what was the ghost last night? According to the proplietic almaanack published every xorning under the title of " Parliamentary Notices" there was work enough prepared for the House to last till 3 o'clock in the morning. There was a series of formidable resolutions by Mr. MxTTz on the
Income-tax; there was a very long resolution, by the well-known pen of MIr. OLavEirm, on the wine duties ; there were important questions to be asked by MIr. CoCHiNE on the Neapolitan papers; by Viscount GODIuOCH on the number of lorchas seized bythe Chinese; and by other inquiring legislators, all of which were either not asked at all, or only asked to be snuffed out with the shortest possible reply. Thus it was that an evening into which the most determined orator might have supposed it impossible to insinuate a single remark was suddenly aground for want of work. It was like a day in Court when, by the withdrawal of half-a-dozen causes, some unlucky litigants low on the list suddenly find themselves called on, when their counsel have not read their briefs, and even the witnesses are not forthconmng. This was the case of the Houso of Commons last night, only a fortnight after its meeting. It has only had nine evenings' work, and of these nine evenings two have turned out blanks, for want of something to say or do. This result is neither uncommon nor wonderful in some companies. It is not everybody who can command attention, or has even the courage to attempt it. But the House of Commons is not a family dinner party; it is not a select circle that has said years ago all it ever had to say on all the subjects within its range. It consists of 654 gentlemen who have worked their wav into it by force of mind and power of circumstances; most of them with strong opinions and cherished objects. There is hardly one of them but will make a fair speech to his county or his town; not one of them but can argue till bedtime at his club, or in his own drawing-room. Every one has a stake in the country; every one his view of what Parliament ought to do. Yet the eighth and ninth nights of the session are suddenly cut short for want of something to say or do.
In fact, the last two evening exhibitions have been performances rather of a gymnastic than a legislative character. Monday's was a fencing match between the CHANcELLoR of the ExRCEQUER with a comrade or two on one side, and Mr. DISRAELr and Mr. GLADsToNE on the other. It was only thrust and parry, and all the reason for each successive movement was to be found in the one before. Last niglit it was the popinjay, or some modern substitute. HER MATEsTy's Ministers stood fire, and a Parliamentary populace had shots at them. It was only one shot that was intended each time, and all that was to be done on the other side was to dodge it or ward it off. The result looks very like an examination for a Echolarship; and if the debates of the liouse are to settle into this, we beg to suggest that the schooi inspectors may be present, and authorized to pronounce on the merit of the answers. But the examination system, questionable even for the purpose of bringing out true talent or ascertaining proficiency, can hardly pretend to any more substantial result. Of itself it does nothing. Conversation that consists of questions and answers is always apt to be dull, inconsecutive, and tiring. There must be a want of " go" about it, for the simple reason tbat it all comes to an end at every reply. You have to pick up your ideas out of chaos at every question, and dissolve again into your original elements when the question is answered. So it's all making and unmaking, planting and pulling up. Buttt it 's no exaggeration to say that this is all we have in last night's debate; while it was hardly better the night before. The truth is that our independent statesmen must adopt a more substantive policy, and a more definite line, than that which merely aims at tripping up an opponent. The very feeblest can fling in a difficulty now and then, and stop the best talk or the best work with a hitch of his own. In our humble opinion there is plenty to be done, and plenty of spare work generously left by HER MLAESTY's Ministers for the rest of the House to undertake if it pleases. They have not monopolized all the duties of a Legislature. So far from being greedy of work, they have scarcely taken care of themselves in this respect, and are open to any amount of new engagements. The coast, then, is open to volunteers, and it shows but little enterprise in the gentlemen, of England that they are so slow to profit by the opportunity.
In a little odd corner of our impression of yes-
In a little odd corner of our impression of yesterday our readers may have seen a short notice of the funeral honours paid on Monday last to a gentleman of whose existence we are ashamed to say we were entirely ignorant-.M. STA.NISLAS WOItCELL. Let it not for a moment be supposed that under this profession of ignorance tLere lies thinly-veiled derision or a sneer. We are quite willing to take the estimate of the deceased gentleman's character from the lips of those who knew him best. Ve assume that he was in fact that which he is said to have been-a pure and upright patriot, who renounced wealth and station in his native Poland from the highest and most conscientious motives-that, although any time during seventeen long years of struggle and trial he needed only to have said one word to regain all that he had lost, yet that word he would never utter, because it carried with it treason to his country's cause, and a renunciation of those principles which were dearer to him than life itself. M. ST.ANISLAS WOBCELL, according to M. LEDRu ROLLIN'S account, was distinguished by the simplicity of his manners, by the purity of his life, and by every quality which could ennoble and dignify hiunan nature. Be it so, and, if it was so, we wlho knew nothing of this gentleman during his life feel it an honour to be enabled to add our meed of praise to the eulogies which were pronounced by his friends over his grave in Highgate Cemetery. It is, perhaps, the hiiglhest proof that can be desired of the truth of their allegations that this gentleman was so little known. He was not one of the noisy refugees who traffic on their misery, as a blind man does upon his defect of sight. He accepted his fate. with resignation. He fought the battle of life with manly fortitude, and was not ever to be found at tea-parties, and in other places of the like kind, wlhining for subscriptions and alms. When we have said thus much, no one, we trust, will accuie us of disrespect to the memory of the late M. STANISLAS WORCELL when we say that in his life he must have been as a raindrop wlhich had fallen into the huge heaving ocean of London existence. How many people are there in this metropolis who were aware of the fact that his funeral rites were celebrated on Monday last in Highgate Cemetery? How many-had they known of the fact-would have attached importance to it for a single moment ? We know, of course, of the existence of political refugees in London, and as 'long as they conduct themselves honestly and respectably, and violate none of our laws, here they are welcome to remain. Each of them must in his degree do exactly what any one of ourselves must do-that is, make a position and establish a character forhiuaself. Many of-them are known, and deservedly respected, and many of them as deservedly despised. It appears, however, that this funeral ceremony, which has passed off with so little notice in London, has roused the wrath of the continental police-in fact, we first became aware of it by reading. in the columns of the OostitWionndl a violen't ;tirade against England and English institutions, which c6ntained a higlhly coloured account of the whole transaction. the writer, who signs himself " A. GiRA'ER -DE CAs-
" SAGNAc," does not even yet seem to have learnt that the English system of dealing with the more outrageous political partisans is essentiaUy different from that which prevails upon the continent. We leave them to themselves and to public opinion. It is astonishing, if left alone, aud not gratified with the smallest grain of what is called " persecution," how soon this race of noisy talkers will run their leaky boats upon the mudbank of public indifference. We believe that by letting slip the police upon their traces you convert maniacs into martyrrs and assassins into archangels. Leave theim to themselves, and the charlatans wil soon obtain no other than the charlatan's dubious dole. We could name at the present moment some half-dozen of the leading continental agitators who are living in London in utter obscurity, after having been permitted thoroughly to discredit themselves by using their oratorical powers as was best pleasing to themselves. M. DE CASSAVNAC tells us that among the Highgate mourners were to be seen murderers and fugitives from justice. If these persons have done murder within the jurisdiction of Great Britain, let us have the evidence, and we will try them at the Old Bailey, and deal with them according to the verdict of the jury. If their alleged crimes have been perpetrated upon foreign soil, there are such tlhings as treaties of extradition in existence, and if they are fairly within the meaning of these compacts an application totheEnglishForeignoffice will no doubt be attended with the desired effect. Meanwhile, we strongly recommend all persons wbo may be unfavourably disposed to the political refugees. now in London to leave them in peace. If you wish to ignore a man's existence you do not beat a big drum and blow a pandean pipe before him every time he takes a turn in the public streets. As a fitting conclusion to this portion of our remarks we would place under the eyes of our French readers a brief quotation from the Count DE MONTAL}MBERT'S work "De VAvenir
"Politiqze de 1'.Agleterre," which may prove to them that the system we recommend for their adoption is the one we use with regard to our own agitators. The passage occurs in the 143d page of M. DE MONTALEEBERT's wvork. He is writing of the proceedings of DA1IEL O'CONNELL in 1843:-
"f l tenait en plein air des meetings, qualifi6s par lIim6me de 'metings mons-trg,' oA ron vit det= et trois cent mille hommes amonceles autour du lieu d'od il faisait entendre, l tosn ceux quo sa voix de Stentor pouvait atteindre, des paroles enflamm6es, qui dGs le lendemain 6taient r6pan-
dues a plusieurs millions d'exemplaires dans tout Pempire
Britannique. Ces Champs de Mai populaires so renouvelRrent plusieurs fois par mois, et mdine par semaine, pendant une ann6e entiare, sous les yeux de la force publique, de la police arm6e et sold6e par le Gouvernement Anglais, mais qui n'intervenait quo pour maintenir l'ordre dans cet immense assemblage d'enneimis."
Such being the practice of the British Government when the safety of the British empire is at stake, with what show of reason can the continental rulers impose upon us the task of hunting to death a few exiles who most assuredly have not violated any English law ?
Thisq, however, is not the only specimen of ignorance with respect to England and English matters which has been afforded to French readers in the columns of the ConstitLutionnel within the last few days. It is indeed most surprising, when we consider the amount of intercourse between the two countries, how little the French seem to know about the internal arrangements of their insular neighbours. Here have we been congratulating ourselves upon the decrease of pauperism, notwithstanding the derangements caused in the demand for domestic labour by, the unproductive expenditure of the late war and by the sudden disbanding of so many soldiers and sailors. The Poor Law returns just published show that whereas in England and Wales upon the 1st of January, 1856, there were 876,655 persons in receipt of relief, on the 1st of January, 1857, there were but 8 43,430 persons in the like predicament-that is to say, we note a decrease of 33,225. Again, let us take the fgures which have reference to adults. The comparison, under conditions as above, is 152,174 in 1856, as against 139,130 in 1857. In other wvords, there is a decrease in pauperism (all ages included) of 3.8 per cent.,-in adult pauperism of 8.6 per cent. Now, according to the census returns of 1861, the population of England and Wales was Dreciselv 17.905Q831- -% , ar,nrlmo i
at the present moment to be little short of 20,000,000. Here, then, out of a population of 20,000,000, or thereabouts, we find that on a given day, in the heart of winter-at the worst season of the year for the labourer-there were just 139,130 adults receiving relief from the public funds. What would our French friends give to know the labour-market of France in as sound a condition? The truth, however, is, that in France no returns are forthcoming which can show the extent and pressure of French pauperism. All private accounts, however, go to show the terrible suffering which a very large portion of the French population must have undergone in consequence of the inundations, of the failure of their three staple crops, and of the exhaustion caused by the war. The poor-rates in England undoubtedly do press heavily upon the smaller class of householders in the poorer parishes of our large towns, but as a general addition to our national burdens they are but of sliglht account. In the British Islands, however, every destitute person is sure of food and shelter. Humble as the pittance must necessarily be, the starving French peasant, we greatly fear, would rej( ice to know that there was such a safeguard between himself and starvation. The writer in the Constitidioanw-this time M. ASr£D£E DE CE5sE-A-takes as his text the late gatherings in Smithfield, which we, had ve been disposed to press a point invidiously, would have selected as the very one which illustrated in the most striking manner the superiority of English institutions over those wlhich prevail in France, or in any part of the continent of Europe. In what capital of the Western world, save in London only, could some thousands of destitute persons have assembled to recount to each other the story of their tribulations witbout imminent danger to the public peace? In London no man gave the matter a second thought, save in so far as thought might avail to devise some plan for the relief of these poor people. The tale of their privations and sufferings had aroused the deepest interest, and nothing could have been more peaceable or more praiseworthy in every sense than the attitude they assumed. Now, will M. DE CEsr,Nt fairly answer this question-" Could such
an assemblage, under such circumstances, have taken place in Paris without imminent danger to public tran(luillity ? The armed police would have acted in the first instance, and if their strength had been insutlicient to disperse the meeting regiment after regimlent would have been called in, and the gutters of Paris would have once more run red with blood.
The fact is, that in England everything is known. The Government rests upon public opinion-a base, as it has been found by experience, so stable that it is now well-nigh two centuries since there has been any change of serious importance in the bands to which the executive power has been intrusted by the donstitution. WVe carefully collect and print everything that tells most severely against ourselves an.Wd our.institutions. In France only the sunny sidesof the peach is displayed to the public eye. We slncnre)y regret to give it as our delibeiate opinion that the estimate obf English pauperis,m must be mul ip£ied tenfold before we should
arrive at a fair representation of the suffering5 which the French population have undergone and are undergoing during the present winter. The writer in the Constifutionr70 again mourns-but it is a triumphant sorrow-over the fact that emigration is the only remedy which the strongest heads iu England can point out for the relief of English pauperism. Let him be consoled i Let not his sympathy with our distress overcome his manly fortitude I There are such places in the world as the United States of America, the Canadas, and Australia, which are now of some little note in the history of mankind. These flourishino communities, with all the splendid prospects which lie before them in the future, represent the misery of British emigrants. No doubt, in a country such as Great Britain, which carries on mercantile and manufacturing operations on so gigantic a scale, every now and then hitches in the labour-market must occur, but emigration, wisely and economically carried out, will cure the defect. The disciples of MALTHUS arrived at the conclusion that a day must shortly come when the last two representatives of AD-AAes race would be found growling and fighting for the one last cabbage. In the same way the economic JERnELAs of the continent, who foresee nothing but the destruction of manufacturing and mercantile England in 4nsequence of the glut of labour, have lost sight of the little fact that manufactures and commerce have enabled us to build steam bridges from the shores of overcrowded England to every portion of the habitable globe. Again we say, let M. DXI CESENA dry his tears and break bread. England will get through the present awful crisis.
We wish to set ourselves right with Lord
We wish to set ourselves right with Lord CA3EPBFLL as to tlhe decision of tho Court of Queen's Bench in the case of " DAvISO2 v. Duti" cA." His Lordship says,-
" It would have been a most monstrons usurpation if we had decided that tho publication before us was not liable to an action; for it had been determined over and over again by our predecessors, by whose decisions we are bound, that if there be anything slanderous in a writing it is no justification to plead that the slanderous matter has been written or spoken by another person."
Now, we submit to Lord CANIPBELL that the " monstrous usurpation," if any such there be, consisted in first enouncing this proposition. Let us look for a moment at the history of this portion of our libel law.
In the twelftlh part of Lord CoRE's reports we find the celebrated case of the Earl of NORTHAMtPToN. It was decided so long ago as 1612, and the resolution was made, after solemn argument, by 11 of the 12 judges of England. The resolution was in these words:-
"In a private action for slander of a common person, if 3. S. publish that he hath heard J. N. say that J. G. was a traitor or thief, in an action on the case he may justify.
"But if J. S. publish that he hath heard generaUy, without a certain author, that J. G. was a traitor or thief, then an action on the case lieth against J. S. for tLis, that he hath not given to the party grieved any cause of action against any but against himself who published the words . for if any one who hath &csama phanta4inz,a or who is a drunkard, sr of no estination, speak scandalous words, if it should be lawful for a man of credit to report them generally withoWd mentioning his author, that would give greater colour and probability that the words were true in respect of the credit of the reporter.'
This was the old common law, and the judges who enounced it quoted abundant decisions of their and of Lord CAMPBELL'S predecessors.
A smatterer in law will object that this resolution was of words spoken, and not of words written. Lord CAmPBELL is too sound a lawyer to make such a reply. He knows that it is most indubitable that when this judgment was given the Courts recognized no distinction between oral and written slander. It was so recently as the year 1812 that the distinction between written and spoken defamation was first formally drawn. Lord Chief Justice IANxSFiELD in his judgment in the case of " TnoiLv V. Lord KBiucy" said that he could find it in none of the old books and abridgments, and he used these words-" I cannot upon "principle make any difference between words "written and words spoken as to the right which "arises on them of bringing an action."
So late as 1824 Lord TENTENDEN, in the case of N GtEGoit V. TuWAITrS," very carefully guarded himself against being supposed to decide that the resolution in Lord NoRTH.AMrPTON'S case did not apply to written as well as to oral slander. We admit that from time to time the judges cast evil eyes upon the old law; but no Court thought itself strong enough to repeal so solemn a decision, ratified by eleven judges and reported by Lord COuE, until in 1829 Chief Justice BEST, in the case of " Df CRESPIroY V. WELLESLEY," stepped out of his way, and, confessedly without any necessity for the purpose of the case before the Court, committed the " monstrous usurpation" of enacting from the bench that the law of England as it existed from the time of JAxrs I. downwards should then be changed.
It was old Lord WYNFOnD who, by his own authority, made this law, and a more "monstrous "usurpation" certainly never was committed by an English judge. We are not aware that there was anything so vast in the intellect of this ancient gentleman, whether as a lawyer, a moralist, or a politician, that we should make a SOLON of him, and swear not to abrogate his decrees until he comes back again. The evil he did might have been undone, and it was quite open to the Queen's Bench in 1855 to say that the judgment of the Common Pleas in 1829 was not law.
This has been done before. There have been Lord Chief Justices who have not dealt so tenderly with the di*ta of their predecessors. Lord .LI&NSFIELD was told, upon an historic occasion, that the constant course of precedents was to seize upon negro slaves in Englaud, and send them back to the WVest Indies. The judgments of Lord TALBOT and Lord HARD ICKE were cited as closing a long series of precedents which ran up into the old feudal slave law of " viUein " regardant"and "villein ingross." But tiat Lord Chief Justice said, " I care not for the supposed " dicta of judges, however eminent, if they be "contrary to all principle. The air of England "has long been too pure for a slave, and every "man is free who breathes it." Lord MANsFrELD was a man who dared to overrule " judge-made "law," and who could openly say, " We do not sit "here to take our rules from SIDEEFIn and
" KEBLE."
WVe have shortly sketched the history of this excrescence upon the libel law, not to criticize Lord CaurPnLV's judicial decision, nor simply to show that it was not quite impossible for his Court to have decided otherwise. Lord CAMPBELL is the only really great lawyer we have upon the bench; others may be formidable to the bar from a
habit of sneering safely indulged ; some may be good pleaders, and aU are honest, painstaking judges. But Lord CAMPBELL is the only man who will be remembered hereafter as having a spark of the genius which lit up the intellects of our BACONS, and MANSrIELDS, and CAvDE* While he follows the last precedents he does not forget that his position entails upon him higher responsibilities, and that he can reform as a legislator what he considers he must be bound by as a judge. It is to help him in this work tlxat we have pointed out thalt this vexatious rule of law is but- an " usurpation " of yesterday; that it is contrary to all ancient authority, and but the edict of E an old Tory judge vhose politics no one respects,
and whose learning noslawyer venerates. I lf Chief Justice BFs's law cannot be overruled there need I not be any scruple about repealing it.

. PARIS, MONDAY, FES. 16, 6 p.m.
'The session for 1857 was opened this day in the Wiace of the Tuileries by the Emperor. The cereInony, which was the same, in nearly all respects, 'a on the last oceasion, took place in the Hall of the Marshals. The throne was placed on a platform tbefore the embrasure of the window looking on the garden. On the right of the Emperor were his -uncle, Prince Jerome Napoleon, and Prince Louis lucien, who arrived from London yesterday for the *opening; and on his left, Prince Napoleon and Prince Murat. On either bide, after the Princes -of the family having rank at the Court were the Grand Almoner, the Grand Chamberlain, the Cardinals, the Miinisters, the Marshals of France, and Admirals. To the right of the throne were the members of the Diplomatic Corps; in front, the President, Vice-Presidents, Grand Referendary, and Senators' to the left, the Presidents, &c., of the Legislativos Body and the Deputies. To the rear of the Senate were seated the deputations of the Court of Cassation and of -the other law courts, the representatives of the -clergy of the various churches, the Prefects of the Seine and Police, the General commanding the National Guard and his Staff, the General and Officers -of the Imperial Guard, those of the Armv of Paris, thqi'First Military Division, and a number of superior officers of thenavy.
The high gallery that runs round the hall was reserved for the Empress and the Princesses of the Imperial Family, and the Graud Master and Mistreis and Ladies of the Households of the Empress and the Princess Mathilde, as also the ladies specially invited. Her Majesty's place was in the centre, and -opposite the Emperor's throne. It is hardly neces-sary to say that all present were in full dress; the usual fonns of precedence and etiquette were observed on entering and on leaving the hall. The :Emperor, whose arrival was anlouniced by a salute of 101 guns, appeared at 1 o'clock. The whole assemblage rose to receive him. IHe at once took his place on the throne, and the Grand Master of the Ceremonies called out, " Gentlemen, be seated."
The Emperor then stood up, and read in an audible voice the speech which appeared in our yesterday's impression.
On concluding the speech the Grand Master of the Cerenionies, by order of the Emperor, called on the Minister of State to Tequest the Deputies and Senators named since the last session to come forward and take the oaths. Their names were 'called, they advanced to the throne, theformula was read by the M1inister, and each, holding forth his right hand, said "I swear !-I swear obedience to the Constitution and fidehlty to the Emperor!" The Minister of State then declared the session opened for 1857, and requested the ~Senators and members of the Legislative Body to -assemble to-morrow in their respective places, in order to commence their labours. Immediately -after, the Emperor first, and then the Empress, retired with their respective co7teiges in the same order -as they had entered. The sitting then closed, the ;assemblage separated, and a second salute of 101 guns ainoirmced to the people of Paris that the ceremony of opening the Chambers was over. The weather was beautiful, and the usual crowds were attracted to the spot to view the proceedings.
A rumour circulated to the effect that the French troops were about to quit the Roman States. This, I am assured, is not the case; on the contrary, it would appear that the corps of occupation is about to be augmented.
The commission for the settlement of the accounts -of the Army of the East has closed its labours, and the report will soon be ready.
Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria, who is here on leave of absence, is spoken of as likely to succeed Marshal Vaillant as Minister of War.
M. de Bourqueney, French Ambassador at Vienna, is expected at Paris on leave of absence.
A bill for the revision of the present law on the French preEs and the printing and bookselling trades -will soon be presented to the Council of State.
Feruk Khan is expected to leave for London in a few days. The French Government is most anxious that the affair should be settled between England ,and Persia.
It is thought that the Neapolitan affair is in a way of settlenment, through the (non-official) instrumentality of M. Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Ambhssador in Paris.
Commercial transactions are still quiet in Paris. The long-expected orders for export have not yet -arrived. The orders received from Eugland are few and insignificant. The same remark applies to the IUnited $tates. It is true that many commission agents vihit the manufactories, but they merely examine patterns and take a list of prices. In fact, the export trade is confined at present to orders from the Danubian Provinces. It is expected that -when the Austrian troops are withdrawn from Mo'davia and Wallachia and those Principalities enjoy a regular government the Boyards will become excellent customers for French produce. The Carnival has of -course caused some activity in certain retail shops, such as those which supply fashionable stuffs for ball dresses. Milliners and mantuamakers are like'vise fully employed, and, strange to say, the articles most in demand are expensive laces and rich stuffs of the most costly kind. The last accounts from the *manufacturers of Lyons are highly favourable. Their busy season has set in, and they can scarcely supply the demand for rich silks and velvets. These orders, however, are for home -consumption, the usual foreign orders not having yet arrived. The letters received last week from the manufacturing towns ofAmiens, Mulhouse, Roubaix and Rouen speak in desponding terms of the badness of trade. WVhere purchasers are found it is on con-dition that the manufacturer's profit be cut down to the lowest possible figure. The building trade alone continues prosperous. Contractors were deterred for some tiune by the high price of timber and iron and workmen's wages; but buildings are again rising on all sides, even in the face of a further rise in the price of building materials. There has been but little variation' in prices throughout the French corn-markets during the last week. 'There is. however, a slight tendency to a rise still observable in the southern departments. In Paris, on the contrary, prices are with difficulty -maintained, and those who wish to force sales are -compelled to make concessions to the buyers. WVheat maintains its price better than flour, and the millers 'complain that their profits are not sufficient. At the last Paris flour market the price of 80f. oOc. the sack of 157 kilogrammes, which was the quotation of the previous day for flour of the first quality, could not he maintained. The bakers forced prices down to 79f. 50c. per sack. According to the official returns which regulate the price of bread in Paris, flonr has fallen from 59f. 82c. the 100 kilogrammes in the first week of September last to -47f. 30c. *he first week of the present month. The reserve of flour in the Paris market has again decreased to 5,500 metrical qumitals. It is now well ascertained that there is a sufficient stock of last year's wheat on hand to supply all demands until next harvest. It is likewise proved, that in consequence of the improved mode of communication by steamboats and railways, Russian wheat moay be imported into France in two months hisa time than it required a few years back. Tue gradually increasing -price of butcher's meat has Qaused the Governureut to direct its atten-
tion to tho possibility of importing beef from the United States, preserved accordiDg to a process for which a patent has been obtained. There is considerable briskness observable in the wine market of Berey, and prices are v'ell maintained. Large consignmients continue to arrive by railwvay from Macon and the southern departments. Accounts from Beziers, Narbonne, and Roussillon state that met only is there a good demand for wines of the frst qualit.y, but likewie for those of the second and third. Spirit distilled from beetroot is falhng in $rice in the Paris market. It is nowr quoted as low as 123f. the hectolitre7 without buyers. Foreign spirits continue to arrive in large qnanti and the stock on hand is increasing every day.
A letter from Bushire, of the 28th December, in the Arojiteusr de 1AnnmUe, gives some details of the occupation of that place and neighbourhood by the English:-
"The part of the army remaining outside the town is in wooden huts, exactly like those used in the Crinea The head-quarters are ori An eminence, to which the name of Balak-lava has besn given, and the-inner bay bas been designated 'the harbour of Sebastopol.' Three days after the place was taken two Protestant churches were established. They are ij a new quarter of the town, called I VictoriA
City.' A racecourse has also been established, and the first day's ruansng was to take place on the 1st of January, the horses of the country being admitted to contest for the primes. A few days after the installation of the troops a proposition was made to the General-in-Chief to establish a railwayacross the town and the English lines, a distance of about two miles. The proposition was accepted, and the line is tobemade without delay. Acemetery hasbeenmarked out, and sarrounded by a wall. In the centre has been erected a monument toGeneralStopford, killed at the taking of the town. It is formaed of a pyramid of red marble, oa the base of which have been inscribed the GeneraPs name and titles and the date of his de&th. Near this monument are the tombs of Lieutenant-Colonel Malet, Captain Wood, and Lieutenant Utterson, all killed on the same occasion ; and those of three other officers, who have been carried off by illness since the occupation."

VIENNA, FEB. 14.
On the 9th there were great rejoicings at Monza, which is now a " Royal city," and as such has the privilege of sending a deputy to the Central Congregation of the province of Lombardy. On the 10th the Emperor made an excursion to Lodi and Crema, where he was extremely well received by vast crowds of people, who had come from far and near to see him. Some days since you were informed that the Mlilanese were inclined to believe that the singers at the Scala had learnt no other opera than Verdi's Trovatore, but on the 9th the " Impresario," being desirous of proving to them that such was not the case, gave that very pretty but somewhat ancient opera L'EIsc.Id 'Amore. As long as their M!ajesties were in the theatre the audience remained quiet, but as soon as their backs were turned the storm burst. The proprietors of the boxes and stalls hissed, the gods performed fantasias on catcalls, the priiicipal singers were coughed and groaned off the stage, and the " makeweights" and choruses vehemently cheered. In short, a regular demonstration a 1'Ittalienite took; place, and its result was, that the Huguenwts was immediately announced for Saturday, the 14th. A few days since the Emperor gave orders that the " Last Supper," which was painted alfresco by Leonardo daVinci in the refectory near the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and several other paintings, should be repaired. His Majesty has also expressed a desire that a monument be erected in Milan to the memory of the above-mentioned great artist. The 2,0001. which the monument is likely to cost will be paid out of the State Treasury. The day on which the Emperor and Empress will leave Milan is not yet positively known, but it is stated that they now intend to be back in Vienna by the 6th of March. It is believed that the proposed changes in the administration of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom are not to the taste of the Council of the Empire; but it is impossible to obtain positive information on a subject of such extreme delicacy.
The Austrian military authorities are evidently somewhat unwilling to quit the Danubian Principalities; but ofticial information has been given me that the Emperor has issued orders to his Generals in Moldavia and Wallachia to bring the troops under their command back to Auistria before the 30th of March. Some of the Vienna papers have hinted that the occupation of the Principalities is likelyas a consequence of the Mouiiteu-'s article relative to the union-to be prolonged, but they are in error. The orders which have been issued on the subject are positive, and no change will be made in them. According to credible letters from Bologna, there is no prospect of the Austrian troops being withdrawn from that city and Ancona. The report that the state of siege is not to be so strictly maintained in the Legations as heretofore deserves little attention. The subjects of His Holiness allow no opportunity of slaking their tbirst for revenge on their "foreign oppressors" to escape them, and the natural consequence of the continual attempts at assassination is, that no mercy is shown to those persons who are taken with arms concealed about their persons. There is a rumour of the Austrians having been obliged to acquit some 40 or 50 prisoners at Bologna for want of sufficient evidence on which to convict them, but we have no means of obtaining any positive information on such a subject. Intelligence has been received from Naples that the Government has expressed a desire to come to an understanding with the Western Powers, but the Austrians are of opinion that the King will not consent to imitate the Emperor Francis Joseph.
The Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna is preparing for a crusade against those persons who may dance during Lent, but he is not likely to meet with much success, as it is almost impossible to take the offenders against his ordinances in the very fact. Last year the police paid several domiciliary visits to families who had been dancing to the music of a piano, but when the Gendarmes entered the room the pianist was playing serious music, to which the other persons present were quietly and attentively list.ening. The Archbishop, who is of a somewhat sanguine temperament, not long ago declared that in a very few years no meat would be cooked in the Vienna hotels and taverns on a Friday, and no private balls given during Lent. Some six months ago mention was made in my correspondeucP cf a work by the Italian Jesuit Perrone, wh-ich was translated into German and published in the Tyrol. The book, which was in the form of a catechism, was a violent attack on the Protestants, who were " to be as carefully avoided as if they were murderers by all good Catholics." The police, at the demand of the Evangelical Consistory of Vienna, confiscated the book, but it will now be permitted to circulate freely, as the Protestasnt conunumity has lost the suit which it instituted against the translhtor and publisher.
The statue of the Virgin which is to be erected at Rome in commemoration of the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception is finished. While the statue was being cast the priests chanted the Litany to the IHoly Virgin and the workmen gave the responses. "Thanks to these excellent arrangements," says the Ultramontane Volksfre-md, " the cast was perfect."
The assertion of the Cotitutionnel that, by the union of Moldavia and Wallachia a State would, be formed which could serve as a buiwark against the progress of Russia, has greatly amused the diplomatic world of Vienna. The news that Count Walewski has received the Grand Cross of the Order of St. A udrew in diamonds from the Emperor
of Russia has caused no surprise here.

BERLIN, FEB. 15.
The French Government has instructed its representatives in London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Berlin to invite the Governments to which they are aceredited to join in a conference at Paris for the settlement of the Neuchatel affair: in spite of the last protocol on this matter having been drawn up in London, the various States interested have agreed that, on account of its geographical position, and on account of the recent negotiations in connexion with Neuchatel having taken place there, Paris is the most suitable spot for the approaching conferences. It seems also to have been arranged that each State shall, on this occasion, empower its ordinary representative in Paris to act for it. It is presumed that. these conferences will be opened in the French capital in the course of this month, but no one will venture to state how long they will last. So farfrom the conference .havingafimishedarrangement laid before it, to which it would have only to affix its seal and authority,. it wilt have'. to .work up the whole, affair, taking the London.protocol for its pont ele d4pct. ->Tho tsecret objectof both Prussia and ~Svitzerla1d wil be to bring about a ehonge in tb> Vienna treside of 1S15; while S,SwitAerland is stlXin to uhtba a reopnized, abolition of
the King!a sovereignty there as Prince, the King of Prussia will seek to obtain the abolition of that share in the administration of the country which his father accorded to the Swiss Government at Vienna in 1815. It is, however, possible that the fear of finding the conference inclined to favour the views of the adversary, in case of any cbange being made at all, may keep both back from proposing any alteration in the state of things introduced by the conferences of Vienma. The idea Of the King giving up his rights in Neuchatel seems to be fading out of sight very rapidly. From here I wzas able same time back to inform you that such an idea lay very remote from all his contemplations.
The last advices from St. Petersburg mention that it will be the commencement of April before the Emperor Alexander sets out on his journey to Nice, and either on his way thither or on his return thence the Emperor will pay a visit to the Emperor Louis Napoleon. Count Kisseleff, who had left Nice on his way back to Paris, and had got as far as Marseilles, has been summoned back to Nice, where, as it would appear, he is to occupy the post near the Empress-Mother which has just become vacant by the departure of Baron von Meyendorff for St. Petersburg. General von MIansuroff, who has just arrived here from the Russian capital, is presumed to be the Baron's definitive successor.
Baron von Richthofen, the Prussian member of the Commission for settling the future constitution of the Danubian Principalities, returned hither a day or two back from Constantinople.
The Relief Ot Jellalabad.
TEE RELIEF OT JB3LLALABAD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TINES.
Sir,-My attention has been attracted by the letter of General Monteath Douglas in your columns of yesterday, commentuig on my speech in the House on the subject of General Sir George PoUock's non-continuance at the India Board, and he quotes me thus,-" General Pollock carried the passes at the point of the bayonet and relieved Jellalabad," and then punctuates with a full stop. Hence he deduces an intention on my part to ignore the actions of Sale and his comrades in their defence of that place.
Now, I object to the conjunction and the fulstop, for they strip my observations of the context, and therefore materially alter what I meant to convey.
I said, " General Pollock forced the passes at the point of the bayonet, relieved Jellalabad, beat the Affghans in three battles, liberated the captives, planted the British f4g on the Bala Hissa of Cabul, and then led back his victorious army through the formidable passes in triumph and safety."
I submit, with great respect to General MonteathDouglas, that this statement should bo accepted as a whole, and not be cut in two by a ful stop. Moreover, the discomfiture of the beleaguering army by the garrison of JeUalabad was not known prior to Poilock's forcing the passes, and in no way affected that movement, and as I spoke of the relief of JelLalahad as subsequently to, and therefore dependent on, the opening of the passes, it is clear that I did not allude to the same fact.
I believe there is not a soldier in the British army who would wish, or, wishing, be so insane, as to dare to attempt to detract from the glorious achievements of the garrison of JeUalabad, so justly named "illustrious" by Lord Ellenborough. The conduct of the officers was beyond aU praise, and they were bravely seconded by their men. The names of Sale, Denny, M'Gregor, and Monteath (the officer who has honoured me by his notice) Will live in history.
As an established fact in the campaign, as a solitary oasis isn the desert of disasters that preceded Pollock's advance, this wiiU stand,-they did defend JeUlalabad, they did relieve theamselves from immediate pressure by thrashing (I use the word advisedly) that cold-blooded cutthroat Akbar, Khan.
But with that exploit, from their limited means, the action of the defenders of Jellalabad of necessity stopped, for there General PoUock found them when he forced the passes at the point of the bayonet, which Wilde had failed to do. PoUock took on with him to Cabul Sale and part of the gallant garrison of Jellalabad. On his return he caught up the remainder of the garrison, and carried it off in safety with him.
Now, with all respect be it said, the Jelalabad garrison could not otherwise have been extricated from its difficult position, because it had not the means or material to make good, singlehanded, its retreat to India through the terrific passes 25 miles in length, every foot of which they must have fought through, opposed by the warlike Ehyberrees.
In this sense, and in no other, did I consider General Pollock as having relieved Jellalabad.
General Mdonteath Douglas must excuse me if I do not subscribe to his dictum, that the defeat of Akbar Khan by the garrison of JeUalabad alone gave confidencetothenative troops, without which they would not have advanced upon CabuL
General Pollock carried the Khyber Pass on the 5th of April; this glorious work of itself would have removed all doubt, had there been any, as to the advance on Cabul; whereas the desperate sally ordered by Sale, and com. manded by Denny (with Monteath second in command until Denny was shot), did not take place until the 7th of April. Neither can I admit that the country was freed by thia sally from the presence of an enemy (as advanced by General Monteath Douglas), because Pollock in his march on Cabul had to conquer hostile enemies at Jugdulluh, at Mamoo Khail, and at Tezeen. General Monteath Douglas observes, tlkat the friends of General Pollock must in future found his claims to distinction upon some surer circumstance than the relief of Jellalabad.
General Pollock has enough of glory and to spare, with. out his admirers requiring to snatch the laurels from the brows of brother soldiers to increase his chaplet, and I trust General Monteath Douglas will do me the justice to believe that I honour conduct and valour too highly to wish to diminish, even in the very minutest degree, the glorious achievements of the " ilustrious" garrison of Jellalabad.
I have the honour to be, your obedient servant
LEICESTER VERNON.
TFouse of Commons, Feb. 17,
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIES.
Sir,-I have read in your issue of yesterday the debate in the House of Commons relative to Sir George Pollock'
" removal" from tho Court of Directors of the East India Company.
As a sincere and earnest admirer of that great and honest man, Sir William Nott, whom I first knew years ago in my youth, I will not hesitate to say a few words on the singular omission of aU allusion to his great services in the debate. It was, perhaps, nattural that Captain Vernon, in advocating so zealously and manfully the cause of Sir George PoUock, should so entirely have sunk in the shade his great rival Nott; but it, says little for the knowledge of Iudian matter. possessed by the House of Commons that no one was found to set him right when -he apparently alluded to General Nott, as the " second in command," who had received the Grand Cross of the Bath, " although he had not received theintermediate distinction." Now, Sir, I take the liberty to observe that General Nott was no second in command to any one. Ho had maintained in the most trying times the honour of the country when isolated, unsupported, and left to his own unaided efforts and resources; and it is a poor encouragement to others to emulate the acts of this good and brave man to have thus, in the Imperial Parliament, his services ignored or depreciated without eliciting either comment or contradiction. General Nott, it is true, was raised without any intermediate distinction to the Grand Cross; that was a reward which, despite his plebeian extraction, could not in decency have been withheld from him, or with reference to the many enemies his known honesty and keen resentment of all injustice had created there can be little doubt that the home military influences of those days would have interfered to prevent it. But the man who had maintained the credit of the country, the eflhi ciency of the army under his command-who had won the I respect and admiration of even the Affghans-who had
fought himself on every occasion when advantage could come of it, and had earnestly, though sometimes fraitlessly, incited others to do the same, could not be "fobbed off" with a second-class distinction; and Nott, to the disgust of many military ari,tocrats aud tufthunters, became a G.C.B.!
As regards his connexion with General Pollock, it was very much this-both were independent commanders. Nott had authority from Lord Ellenborough, the then Governor. Genera', to act in his discretion as he should see fit, either by "retiring" his force vid Quetta and that line of route, or, by advancing through the heart of the country rid Ghuznee to Cabul, to place himself in co-operation with General PoUock. The risk, however, of this last route was so apparent that the Governor.General, with a wiso caution, such as he has not been thought to have displayed on, all occasions, enjoined upon him that the movement; by Ghuzmee must be undertaken on his own responsibility, and with reference to his estimate of his own strength and that of the enemy.
Nott's resolution was come to in a moment. He had matured and formed it long before. He had urged that course previously as the only one consistent with the honour of our arms._ Re incurred freely the risk and responsibilitys and he most successfully achieved it. When he approa&hed Cskul the two generals.entered into communication, 'a d Nott, as the junior, became then subordinate to SiikGeo'Zge, but he-never occupied the place of a mere second in command. He was justly alive to the great merit of hi 'see
vic4e-> the unspeakable value of that constancy b had so
P1gnalfrdisplayed, and would never have consented to I'AZ 6 h*cself 1r such a position with reference to one who waa iurely no more than his mere eqeal. So much for the ignoing of General Nott, the most upright, truthful and honest soldier the East India Compny, perhaps, ever had to boast of.
I would now wish to add a few words In reference to the extraordinary conduct of Mr. Smith-a member of the Cabinet and Minister in effect for India. Sir, I have been in the East for many years, and have served on the staff with many distinguisbed commanders-with, more recentlyt Lord Gough, Sir Charles Napier, Sir William Gomm, General Anson, and others, and I do not hesitate to say that during a protracted offlcial experience I never saw or read anything more uncandid or fraught with insincerity than this note of " March 20" from the President of the India Board. The permission to Sir George Pollock to " let it be considered" that he had done what realy he was not about to do-a fact of which MIr. Smith was evidently well awareis simply just one of those proceedings only to be regarded ax evidencing an aptitude for the committal of acts which I will not further characterize, and if General PoDlock was not the world-wide cautious man he is well-known to be a far more distasteful "hcone to pick" would aEsuredly have been offered in reply to the eyes of the Minister.
As I am not a candidate for office under so appareutly disingenuous a person, I presume to speak the truth, and to state that this sort of tricky proceedings being read in India is calculated to do infinite mischief there, for they fill the natives with doubt and distrust, they encourage the intriguing and dishonest, and disguAt those who are truthful and upright. Mir. Smith may, for anything the public can teU, become the future Governor-General of India; and what would be thought of this matter in that case, when men there compared his assertions of unfitness, his feeling "compelled to supersede' one whom the "infirmities of age" rendered incompetent, &c., with the " in spite of the high value I set upon your services" of his note? What would the astute natives of India, his colleagues in council, hiis secretaries, and others, think of the dependence to be placed in him-what confidence of any party can a man of this stamp hope to enjoy, and who so blind as not to perceive the singular shallowness of that reasoning which would have us believe that the nominees of Sir C. Wood are more subservient to him than his own are likely to prove; and who so ungenerous as not to condemn the sneer and insinuation as to Sir George Pollock's imputed readiness to be always subservient, and " never to interfere ?"
Imagine, Sir, what would have been the position of that candid, truth-loving nobleman, Lord Dalhousie, with all the opponents he has had at various times to contend with, if he had ever so pitifully committed himself. Where would he then have been in his famous controversy with that keen, able, bold man, Sir Charles Napier? No, such trickdom should be put down, and it behoves every honest man to assist to do it.
Again, the pretence set up by Mr. Smith that his letter to Sir George Pollock was " private," can onlybe regarded with ontempt. If it were indeed so, then a Minister might propose to a Director, or to any one, the most base, the most nefarious conduct, and the recipient, forsooth, would be bound by MIr. Smith's code to keep silence as a point of honour. I venture to say that in these days no public man is justified by the feelng of the country in making mean or disingenuous or collusive proposals to others; and if the President of the India Board thinks otherwise he is unfit to deal with honourable men. I am aware that in high places there is sometimes an omnia wtpendens naso mode of regarding just strictures upon their public acts; but it is to ho hoped the time for such displays of official insolence and indifference is rapidly passing by.
No, Sir; this kind of shuffling insincerity does infinite harm, and no laboured sophistical reasoning can set it right. It lowers the dignity and influence of men in high position; it gives a handle to the carping and discontented, and it disgusts and drives from public life those who do not feel disposed to lower themselves in their own esteem, or to take part in such wretched mining and counter-mining.
I apologize for this intrusion on your space, but I owe too deep a debt of gratitude to India to refrain, out of false delicacy, from reprobating what is every way so condemnable. I enclose you my card, and remain

Exeter, Feb. 14
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMIES.
Sir,-It is much to be regretted that Lieutenant-General Monteath Douglas in his letter, published yesterday in your columns (and therefore tn the world at large), should have taken so contracted and tactical a view of the relief of the garrison of Jellalabad.
The "illustrious" garrison availed themselves of the Inown approach of the relieving army to make a most gallant sortie on the troops of Akbar Khan, but that attack might have failed had the Affghans' attention not been turned towards the advancing army under Sir G. PoUock; nor, in the event of success of a temporary nature, could the garrison have obtained supplies or forced the passes, had the relief, in fact, not been carried out strategically.
A late author on Tactics and Strategy was therefore fully justified in stating-" General Pollock moved on JeUlsabad, having strategically secured his advance; he crowned the heights and carried triumphantly his force to the relief of the' illustrious' garrison, and afterwards formed a junction with General Nott at Cabul, and thus effected the release of all the prisoners, including Lady Macnaghten and lady Sale."
Lieutenant-General Monteath Douglas states that from the ]3th of November, 1851, to the 7th of April, 1852, the garrison of Jellalabad was left to the mercy of the whole Affghan nation. The gaUant General would probably not have been alive to make this assertion had the British Indian Government not matured, and General Pollock most gallantly and scientifically carried forward, at the opportune time, the relieving and retrieving army.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

THE DUTY ON TEA.-Yesterday the importers
THE DurTy oN TEA.-Yesterday the importers and dealers in tea met again, by adjournment, at the London Tavern, to consider the best steps to be taken to procure A reduction of the war tax proposed to be retained on that article of commerce. The meeting was held in the large room, where thero was a considerable attendance of those interested in the trade. Mr. Moffat, M.P., presided, as on the previous occasion, and opened the proceedings by stating tne course which the committee had pursued since the previous day. Immediately after the meeting had adjourned the committee met, and, after a most ful disCusSioD, they resolved on a prompt and instant course of acton. They were fuUy impressed with the feeling that pervaded the meeting yesterday, that a great breach of faith had been committed towards a most important trade, but, at the same time, viewing the whole of the fiscal interests of the country, they felt also that it was neces"ary to adopt some proposition which should obtain for them a fair hearing from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was agreed, therefore, to endeavour to obtain an interview with the Chancellor, and propose to him that it was desirable to av.id the continual gradations of duty which he (the Chancellor) had proposed, and that it would be better for the permanent interests of the trade to fix the dnty for the next three years at ls. 4d., and at the expiration of that time to come down to the duty of Is. per pound. (Cheers.) Tney went then to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and lhid before him their statement with reference to the departure from the act of 1855, and they received an answer which was not entirely unexpected by them-viz., that "he was sorry for it, but could not help them." (Groans.) The committee then made their second proposition, and it was received with a good deal of attention and consideration by the right hon. gentleman. He said he thou-'ht the duty had been fixed on too low a scale, but that he -ked the plan of a fixed duty for the next three years, and he would give the proposition his consideration. (Cheers.) The difference between the proposition of the Chancelor of a duty of Is. 7d. and the committee's suggestion of a duty of ls 4d. only amounted to about 130,00., and with so small a lOES as that the committee had a right to insist upou their terms being consi-
dered, and to use al the censtitutional means in their power tmO securetheiradoption. (Cheers.) MIr. S. Gregson, M.P.,
Mh. this meeting views with deep regret and disappointment any departure op on the provibions of the act of Parliament by which the d.ty ontea wastfixed for is. 3.foethe ensuing year. ThaItan alters-. tion to any higher rate of duty iuvolves a serious inoDnvelence in the arrangemnents Inade for importation of tea from China and deplorable disterbance ,f extd ting contracts, whicg hare been exteosively made therouehout thein noledkssthon tSe,5aithuOOlhbat act; but that owing

Her Majesty's eteamTessel Wye, Master-Commander Moore, 2 guns and 100-horse power, arrived at Spithead yesterday from the Mediterranean. She left Gibraltar on the 9th inst. On the IOIh and 11th she encountered heavy gales from the north-west, and lost a quarterboat, but had fine weather crossing the Bay of Biscay. The Wye was formerly the Hccla, and bought by the Government from the North of Europe Steam Navigation Company to be converted into a watertank for distilling water for the use of the fleet, then at Balaklava. She was fitted for this duty by Mr. T. T. Grant, the ControUer of Victualling at Portsmouth Dockyard, in the faU of the year 1855, and sent to the Black Sea in the spring of the following year, where she has been distiUing from 30,000 to 35,000 gallons of water per day of exceUent quality. The crew has had no other water, and there has been no sickness among them. She left Spithead for Woolwich to be paid off. The Governor of Gibraltar was particularly desirous that the Wye should have been left there, as when sh, sailed he had not more than 1,000 gaUons of water in th, garrison. She brought home Captain Ross, R.N., Mr. Goldsworthy, R.N., Lieutenant Butcher, R.bL, invalided from HIer Majesty's ship Curagoa; Mrs. Allen and son and Dr. Toms, R.N., in medical charge, on promotion.

Ordnance Survey Of Great Britain.
ORDN.AACE SURVBY OF GREAT BRITAIN.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In your leading article of to-day on " the pecuniary incontinence of the House of Commons " you have faUllen into two mistakes in your observations on the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain which I feel certain you will be anxious to correct as soon as they are pointed out.
You say " the House of Commons has recontly sanctioned a survey of Scotland on the scale of five feet to a mile ," and that " it will give every Scotch proprietor, at the pubhc expense, a botter map of his 1,000 or 2,000 acres of moor than is possessed by anyEnglish gentle man who has not gone to great expense for such a purpose "
loow, tbe facts are, first, as regards the scale of the plans of the uncultivated districts, the Treasury minute and my orders on this subject direct " that the Eighland and other nartially-cultivated and thinly-populated districts shaU be arawn on the scale of six inches to a mile," which is only one-tenth of the scale stated in 2hc Time, as applied to the lnear measure, and only one-hundreth of that scale as applied to the area of the ground.
2. You say that the Scotch proprietor under the present arrangements for the survey obtains, at the public expense, better maps than the English proprietor can obtain at great personal expenso, the fact being that the surveys of Bngland and Scotland are proceeding pari passu, and under precisely similar instructions, and altbough in a numerical return of the counties published in England and Scotland on the large scales the number of English counties appears smaU, yet when it is borne in mind that
orkshire alone, the plans of which have been engraved and published on the six-inch scale, is eaual in area to the counties of Edinburgh, Haddingtin, Linlithgow, Fife, Wigton, Kirkecndbright, Ayr, and Dumfries, it will be seen that, as far as any objection can be made on the score of expenditure in one part of Great Britain rather than another, the English have nothing to com-
The maps of every county in Ireland have been long since published on the six-inch scale, and their great value has never been questioned, and many irnportant measures connected with the improvement of the country could not be carried out withoat it.
I have no desire to revive in your columns the discussions as to the best scales for the maps of this or any other civilized country ; the subject has already been very taully discussed in Parliamentary committees, and in both Houses of Parliament, and the opinions of the most eminent and practical men conversant with the subject are set forth in the published volume of Correspondence on the Scale of the Surve, which has been l_id before Parliament; but 1 may observe that the scales now adopted are those-making allowance for the difference in the measures of the countries-which are adopted in France, Belgium, and Bavaria, and are those which were recwm"nended by the Statistical Congress held in Brussels in 1854; and I may be allowed to add that, having reference to the great objects in view-viz., the registration of property, the means of facilitating the transfer of landed property, the valuation of property, and all engineering purposes, civil and military, including mining, the geological and hydrographical surveys, and all other purposes for which an accurate map is a necessary basis-the scales now adopted, as far as I can judge, after a long experience in almost every class of engineering works, and after a very careful consideration of the subject, are perfectly suited for the national survey.
There are other mistakes in your observationson the survey which I should be happy to explain if I could venture so far to trespass on your space. Such, for example, as tle statement that the contours are at every 25 yards; snd as regards the survey of Lewis, although I cannot defend the minute details of that portion of the survey, which was made long before my appointment as superintendent, the proprietor of that island, in paying a sum towards the expense of the survey, on the condition that it should be proceeded with atZonce, only followed the example of the gentlemen of Lincolnshire in so doing
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

Haymarket Theatre.
HA YMAKET2 THEA T.
Considering the immense popularity of the late Madame Emile Girardin's posthumous piece Une Fcemmc qui d6testg son Jfari, when produced last October at the Gyinnase, it is somewhat surprismg that it has not sooner found its way to the London stage. Tho British adapters are, however, making up for lost time, and, if rumour speaks truly, another week will not pass over our heads til distinct versions of this celebrated little comedy have been seen at three of the principal West-end theatres.
The Haymarket is first in the field, and presents its audience with an almost literal translation, entitled the Wicked Wifc. Here, therefore, the public, besides recreating itself 'with a very mteresting work, may prepare for the other "detesting" ladies, 'who are to make their appearance elsewhere, and decide the measure of their approximation to,
Like many of the most popular works of the modern Parisisn stage, UnC Femme qui d4kste son AIari is ratber . dramatic anecdote than a full-bodied composition that; would have satisfied the notion of a " play" entertained byr our fathers. MIadame de Langrais (acted at the Haymarket by Miss Reynolds), is a lady who during the revolutionary reign of terror professes a republicanism of the deepest dyi,
ana consistent hatred for her husband (a proscribed Giron-. din), together with all his family, and even her own child
The forms necessary for the divorce that is to break a detested tie and make way for the happiness of Citizen Rozaiua (Mr. Rogers), a busy agent of Robespierre's, are nearly coipnlete, and she vill soon have a husband of principles mrsilar to her own. In the meanwhile her mother.in-law, who dreads an arrest, and who since the flight of the unfortunate husband, takes charge of the child, implores her protecion; the child herself is brought unon the stage, and innocently appeals to the maternal feelings ; but all i vain. The Citoyenne Langrais is so ardent a lover of her countrr that natural feelings are as nothing in her eyes, and while ahe gains the constant applause of her servant Finot (Mr. Compton), she is regarded by ordinary people as an exceedingly " wicked w ife." But, as the audience know from the very rsing of the curtain, her excessive wickedness, or hubime virtue (as folks may please to call it), is only assumed in order to save the very man she affects to bate, but whom she loves with all her heart and soul. While she is, receiving the homage of the citizen Rozaire with seeming pleasure, while she is treating her mother-in-law with icy coldness and ropellinh her child. from her arms, her husband, ML de Langrais (tlr. Howe), is actually concealed in the house, and between each successive visit has an interview with her, in which he ex-
ressesh gratitude and his affection. Were her assumed easaion a whit less bitter her house would be suspected as the place of concealment, and even the double-backed cupboard in which he is incarcerated would afford no safe
lace of retreat. As it is, the rumours that somebody is Eidden somewhere are pretty widely spread, and the jealous an2ieties of Itozaire and the republican zeal of Finot ultimately cause a search. However, when escape seems impossible, the fall of Robespierre conveniently occurs, and consequently De Langris is able to embrace his wife in the sight of the world, while Rozaire, as an adherent to the, fallen party, is glad to make acquaintance with the cupboard as a shelter from the infuriate mob.
There are two elements of interest in this piece. The first belongs to the wife, whose real and assumed characters are conutantly alternating with each other through the whole course of the action. ETery minute some compromising word is about to escape her lips, or some unguarded look threatens to betray the emotions of her heart; but she never so thoroughly loses her presence of mind as not to check her emotions at the right instant. This struggle, concealed fromn the other personages, is always in sight of the audience, and hence there is an unceasing demand for varieties of expression, to which Miss Reynolds most ably responds. The other element of interest is of a more melodramatic kind, and arises from the great ingenuity with which the circumstances of tbeconcealment are managed, Now detectionseems certain, now it is dexterously avoided: now Finot is active in promoting discovery; now he relents,'and, having found out
e Langrais, assists in mystifying his p ursuers; and thus there is a perpetual anxiety s to what the next moment will bring forth The frank, gallant, affectionate manner of Mr. Howe and the wiry shrewvdness of hr Compton are of no, small service to the general effect of this excellent little drame.
Adelphi Theatre.
ADELPHI THEATRE.
Mr. Samuel Lover, in his Wlhile Horse of the Peppers, showed how anIriah gentleman frightened a Dntch aerent of King William IIL out of the estate that he had acquiredc as a roward for military services. The author of the new farce entitled Barney thz Baron gives the converse of this tale, and shows how an Irish tinker, who has won a German castle by lottery, is so terrified by a sham ghost that he 'willingly vends it to the descendant of its ancient owner. In itself this piece is nothing. As a vehicle for displaying the humour of Mr. Barney Williams it is invaluable. The shrewdness and ignorance combined in his face when he comes to take possession of his prize are expressed with wondrous force. lis sparkling e3 es declare intense gratification, but he is perplexed with. the contingencies appertaining to his dignity, and makes you feel that, noble as his acquisition may be, anything that was not a castle would have been more to his taste. When he gives a banquet (to himself) the cook boils his potatoes withoutthe " jackets," and the indignation which Is aroused within him, and prompts him to hurl the iI fruit" at the terrified domestics, surpasses the pleasure that he derives from any part of the repast except the wine. To the stimulating beverage ho betakes himself with a swinish sense of enjoyment that could not be surpassed. He fills glass after glass without a sensible pause between the successive operations; he sucks the bottle when further pouring is impossible, and the increasing vacancy of his gaze denotes wonder at the change in his own internal condition. He would carry a flask under his arm, but he puts a candlestick in its place, and that so clumsily that when he tries to drink he perpetnally burns his nose. When he would go to bea, a series of adventures is the resulk of the attempt. If he is cautious, he falls on tho ground, without reaching the seat of repose; if he is bold, he leaps over it. The bed tasks Lis ingenuity and his patience to the utmost. He can lie to the right of the bed, or to the left of the bed, or under the bed, but the bed itself is a mark beyond the Hibernian brain, Feasoned as It is with Rhenish wine. Alany may think that stage " Irishmen" have been done to death; but here is a fresh. humourous impersonation, sparkling with ingenious detail at every point, and imitated froni no predecessor whatever.
Surrey Theatre.
SURREY TL!EATRE.
It is the usage at this house to abandon tragedy during the few weeks after Christmas, and to rely on the Proverbial success of the pantomime, to which some work of a, lighter class serves as prelude. During this pause Mr. Creswick habitually reposes, and his re-appearance, when it has expired, is regarded as a sort of do&iU for the season by the transpontine world. For some time past the comedy entitled A Bird in the Band Worth two in 1t7 Bush. has proved a most attractive addition to the pantomine, and, perhaps, few pieces produced at the Surrey have beeni so generally talked about, even on the northern side of the river. This week, however, the tragic muse has returned to her sonthern temple; Mr. Knowles's Viryinius has been revived with great 6cdat, and Mr. Creswick has been heartily welcomed as the representative of the stern Roman father. Nor is the " Bird in the Hand'suffered to fly away; it is played alternately with thek tragedy.

AONBY-MARKAET ad OITYINTELLIGNOB.
Tuesday Evening.
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per; miMe premium, and the short exchange on London; as 25.20 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates; with the English Mfint price of 31. 17s. lOkd. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 5-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in
London.I
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is
4244per mark, and the short exchange on London is'!
13 *per11.sterling. Standard gold at the English MInt price is therefore nearly 2-lOths per cent. dearer in HIamburg than in London.i
The course of exchange at New York on London for bils at 60 days' sight is 108i per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is against England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The English funds opened this morning with a tendency to improvement, and, although the market wvas subsequently checked by a heavy sale, it prosented at the last moment an appearanco of considerable firmness. Consols for money, which closed last evening at 93R to i, were first quoted 93 to ., whence they advanced to 931. A sale of 100,0001. stock for delivery then caused a reaction to 93j to i, at which they remained to the official close, the price for the 5th of March being 931 to J. After regular hours, however, there were several transactions at a rise of an eighth, better prices from the Paris Bourso, coupled with firmness in the foreign exchanges, having imparted a feeling of animation. The Emperos speech at the opening of the French Legislature was regarded favourably, although the announcement that the revenue of 1858 will suffice without loans was unaccompanied by any statement as to whether there is a deficiency for the present year to be made up. An Imperial decree for increasing the issue of Treasury-bills for 1857 appears to have been published yesterday, and some further explanations, therefore, are requisite to enable an opinion to be formed as to the exact position of the general finances. Bank Stock left off at 216j to 218; Reduced, 931 to J; New Three per Cents., 94 to i; India Stock, 219 to 221; India Bonds, 2s. discount to ls. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98k to 1; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was no pressure for money, and lower rates were accepted until the heavy sale of stock took place in the afternoon. In the discount-market there was increased ease, and the applications at the Bank were limited.
The 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds to be paid off on the 8th of May are not held in the public market, and are believed to have been taken at the time of their issue on account of the savings-banks, or some other Government trusts. This, however, will not alter the necessity for finding a neow means of investment for the amount, and the Consol and other markets derive support from the anticipation of the influence it may exercise.
Foreign securities were rather firmer to-day, but the general transactions were unimportant. In Turkish Six per Cents. the bargains for money were at 95i; for the account 95 and 95j. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 101i and i. Purchases of Venezuela Deferred took place at 15". The other business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 102i and 103i; the Four-and-aHalf per Cents., New, 97k; Buenos Ayres, for account, 86; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half Per Cents., for account, 80; Portuguese Three pr (Cents., 45; the Three per Cents., 1856, 43; Spanish Certificates, 6f; and Dutch Four per Cents. Certificates,
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was an advance in the rates upon Holland and Belgium. Other quotations also indicated an upward tendency.
Notwithstanding the great heaviness of the market for silver, and the apparent fact that importations of it from the continent cannot now take place except at a loss, gold continues to be withdrawn from the Bank to pay for purchases effected. Yesterday the amount taken was only 10,0001., but to-day it has been 28,0001. This continued drain would tend to revive the recent anticipations of the necessity of some new restrictions on the part of the Bank,were it not for the circumstance that its effects are still fully counteracted by an influx of sovereigns from Ireland and other sources.
At an adjourned meeting of the importers and dealers in tea held to-day a resolution was adopted, suggesting that in place of his proposal to reduce the existing duty of is. 9d. to ls. 7d. this year, to as 5d. in 1858, Is. 3d. in 1859, and is. in 1860, the Cbancellor of the Exchequer should adopt a fixed rate of Is. 4d. for the three years up to the 5th of April, 1860. The compromise would involve only a partial surrender of contemplated revenue, and it would have the good effect of freeing the trade and the public from the trouble of frequent changes. Whatever decision may be arrived at, it is to be hoped that the dissatiefaction which has been created in this branch of business will operate as a warning to future financiers against committing themselves to any particular course beyond the year for which they are legislating. The frequent disappominments inflicted on the public during the pa t 15 years with regard to the expiry of the Incometax has tended greatly to discredit aU Ministerial promises; and when similar deviations are made in arrangements on which mercantile operations are extensively based the prospect of complaint is proportionably increased.
A meeting was held to-day of the creditors of Mr. G. Sichol, general merchant, who recently suspended, Mr. Griffiths in the chair, when a rough statement of debts and liabilities was presented by Mr. Parrington, the accountant. It was stated that sufficient time has not elapsed to prepare a balancesheet, but that owing to pending legal proceeding's it was thought necessary to consult the general body of claimants. The books in consequence of neglect are in great confusion, but an approximate estimate may be taken, to include debts, .49,1441., and assets, 27,5171. There are liabilities to the extent of 143,1141., which it is asserted wiU run off, but no accurate information can be given. The property includes a claim upon a forest in the Asturias,the profit derivable from the erection of a patent slip at Bahia, and consigmnents to Australia, Egypt, South America, Germany, and various other places. A long discussion ensued, at the termination of which a proposal to pay 10s. in the pound, on condition of a letter of license being granted for two years, to be extended to three if at the end of two years 5s. shall have been paid, was put to the vote, and carried by a smaU majority.
Meetings of the Peninsular, Castilian, and Iberian Mining Companiea took place to-day, the whole of the mines being worked under one management. In the case of the Peninsular the balance is stated to be 1,1001., and if the results of operations are not shortly more encouraging the directors propose to bring them to a close. The balance, according to the accounts of the Castilian, is 1341. In this instance the workings of the six months show a slight profit, btit unless returns greatly increase the board will not advise an expenditure on further operations. 'The statement of the Iberian Company shows a balance of 4741., and it is feared the result will be unsatisfactory. Although lodes with a large quantity of ore at surface have been opened, thoy
are found on deeper working to become sterile. The managers, remarking on the progress of mining in Spain, state that they have anxiously wvatched the operations of other companies, including those of foreign proprietors, and that they have to admit that "failure seems the general rule, and success the exception."
Purchases of bar silver for the overland mail of the 4th of March have to-day been effected at 61Od. per oz.

MANCHESTER, FEB. 17.
In the present excited state of the cotton-market spinners andi manufacturers are mostly either asldng much higher prces or completely withdrawing their productions from the market. An advance of 1Ad. per piece has been esta. blished on shirtings since last Friday, including this description of fabric suitable to the markets of India and China, and elsewhere. Higher prices are asked for T- clothsand longeloths, but buyers hesitate to give them. There has been a fair business done in yarns smted to the German market, and prices close at id. to id. per lb. ad. vance on the quotations of last Tuesday. In cop yarns for the home trade there has been less demand, at id. per lb. advance; but, as stated before, spiners are in some cases disheartened at the position in which they find themselves, and have withdrawn their stocks at present prices.

There has been an average attendance of buyers in the cloth-halls this morning, and new and seasonable goods met with ready sale. Prices continue firm, and a good deal of business as done directly between maanufacturers and merchants, so that the supply of goods in the hails continmes very smnall.
The Huddersfield cloth-market to-day has been much the same as last Tuesday. There is a good demand for piecedyed black doeskins, black unions, &c.; and bordered goods of new or choice patterns find a ready sale. In wool prices are very firm, and transactions are few. Manufacturers as usual at this season, are waiting for the wool sales.

THE NEWFORT.-SLAVE TRADE.
(Before JMr. PD7I333ERTON LEiGu. Sir EDwAr.D RYAN;,
Dr. LUSHINGTON. and SirJou PATTrsox.1
-.- appeas crom a cecree of the Vice-Admiralty Court at St. Helena, by which the New.port was condexmned on the 24th of Novemaber, 1L854, for ha-ring been at the time of seizure, the 21st of Septermber, 1854. engaged in the slave trade, and Messrs. Pinto, Perez, and Co., merchants, of London, the shippers of thye cargo, were condemned in penalties to the amount of 12,9151. 17s. Od., being dotuble the value of the carlo. Various prelimina-ry proceedings havini taken place in the Court of Apal,4 on the 21st of April ast year, the appellants, namely r. Hocquard, the waster, the oriial appellant, and Messrs. Pinto, Perez, and Co., andJyo.sle Maria Perez respectively, interveners, brought in by prmisaoion of their Lordships a special allegation, with exhibits annexed, whieh was admitted without oppostion. The respondents, niamely, Her Majesty and the commander, officers, and crew of the ship of war Philomnel, by which the Newport was captured, now brought in an allegation responsive thereto, the admission of wh iich was opposed by the appellants.
The QuExiN's ADVOCATE (with whom was the AttorneyGeneral and Dr. Jennerj havzng mnoved the admiission of the allegation on bebalf of t e respondents,
Dr. Twis said it was his lt, on te part of the appellants, to ask their Lordships to iveject the allegation in toto. 2 his was a proceeding under the 5th George IV., cap. 113, an Act for the Abolition of Slavery, the seventh section of which more particularly applied to the present case. This statute was of a highly penal character, and it had been
ured b using the words " knowingly andl wilfully."1 The burden of proo?f in these cases was thrown, according to the decision in "Barton and others v. the Queen" (2, Mkoore, 19), u~pon the prosecutors, and it was for their LordaLhipe, to consider whether- tche allegation now tendered was capable of proof-whether it was admissible or not. There were one or two articles which in form were responsive, but he doubted whether they were so in substance.
Dr. LuslirsGToN said that the learned counsel could not go beyond this-that the averments in the allegation were not pertinent to the issue.
Dr. Twiss submnitted that if, when the allegation was proved, it could only establish a prim4 fade case of suspi. cion, then such an allegation, when brought in as responsive to facts, would not he admissible as a responsive allegation. In another class of cases of a very different character, occurring under the 4th George IV., cap. 76-the Marriage Act-a statute also of a highl penal nature, it was held in the Consistory Court, in "l)ormer v. Williams," 1 Curt, 879, that there being'no guilty. knowledge a marriag could not be invalidated. If the articles contained in the present allegation were all proved, they would not work- out the general principle for which his learnedl friends contended, that Messrs. P?into, Perez, andI Co., the interveners, had knowingly and wiilfully comamitted an act where~by they had incurred the penalties imposed. The 1st article pleaded that on the 8th of June, 1854, the brig ewort railed from London, bound for Anmbriz., on th W est Coast of Africa" and thence, if required, to Loanda, on the same coast, and then it set forth the nature of the cargo. Those facts had already been before the Cout The article further salted that the brig was consigned to Flores, a Portuguese subiect, who resided at Loanda, and that on being captured she was taken first to Loanda. The 2d article pleaded that Flores, at the time the brigwas at Loanda, resided there, and was aware that she was about to be sent to St. Helena for adjudicaLtion; that although, as now alleged, he was sole owner of the cargo then on board, yet he did not interfere. The pro. ceedings, however, in the court below were adverse to the shippers, and Flores was no part in the suit. The allegation brought in on behalf of the shippers was for the pu-
se of reheving themselves from double penalties. The gadarticle pleaded in contradiction to the 4th article of the appellants' allegation, "1That each of the demaijohns on beard was capable of holding from four to five gallons of water ; that the packs and shocks were, in fact, casks taken to pieces and packed for convenience, and that iron-boos
adrivets for the purpose of putting the packs and shock together, and re-converting them into caks, were ordered by Flores, and shipped by Pinto, Perez, and Co. for that express purpose, and that the packs and shocks mnight have thereby been put together, or re-converted into casks in a short spae of time, and that a large portion of the cargo consisted of gGods commonly used for the pur. chaSe Of slaves by barter on the West Coast of Africa" Could their Lordships from that article come to the conclusion that the shippers knowinglVy and wilfaull put those things on beard ? The 4th articleI pleaded with-reference to an averment in the 2d article of the lappellants allegation, to the effect that Pinto, Perez, and Co. were not required, nor were under any legal obligation, to give bond f[or any othertpart of the cargo than for the arms and gunpowder; that te owners ought duly to havegve bend for th e packs or shocks and demijohns, and to have: obtained from the officers of the Customs a certificate of having so done. In the general Custom-house orders there was a minute at perfect variance with the statement of the law given by the respondents. The 5th article pleaded that a treaty for the 1supprsson of the slave trade-was made on the 28th of June,
13,btween England and Spain, by the 6th section of the 10h rtcl of which it was mutually agreed that every merchaint vessel, British or Spanish, might be lawfully detained if in her equipment there should be found "1an extraordinoary number of water-caskcs or of other vessels for holding liquid, unless the master shall produce a certificate from the Custom-house at the place fromn which he cleared outwards, stating that a sufficient security had been given by the owner of such vessl that such extra quantity of casks or of other vessels should only be used to hold palma oil, or for other purposes of lawful commerce." The 6th article pleaded a numiber of treaties with different Powers for the suppression of the eslve trade. The 5th and 6th articles he (Dr. Twiss) s'ubmitted had nothing to do with the case. The 7th article pleaded that it -was untruly alleged in the 8th artcle of the appellants' alleeation that the brig was seized without any just ground or probable cause. In his opinion, the object of the allegation was to set up probable cause for seizure, and so avoid condemnation in costs and damnages The article was responsive In form, but not in substance. The 8th article pleaded "That Augusto Gorrido, by whose instructions5 as the agent of Flores, the appeDllants, in the 2d ariRcle of their allegation, all1eged that they shipped the cargo
inqetion, was for many years past notoriously an extesv dealer in slaves at Ambriz. and in various other place on the West Coast of Africa ; that he constantly purchased slaves, kept them in barracoons, and shipped them thence both on his own account and as the partner ajid
agnt of others; and especially that he shipped cage of sla'ves from that coast in December, 1846, in March, 1848, and in May, 1850." It seemed to him (Dr. Twiss) that that article was ir-relevant, hut if their lordships were of opinion that it was pertinent to the issue, then he prayed them to direct it so to be pleaded that the appellants could counterplead it. To set up a fact that would merely raise a suspicion was not proper in a respnsive allegation.
TheQu~ur' AvocrE dmtted that the 8th article standing alone might not be admissible, buxt in the 9th article it wvas pleaded that Messrs. Pinto, Perez, andl Co. well knew those facts.
Dr. Twsss.-The 10th pleaded that Flores, who by Jose Maria Pinto was appeain and claiming the cargo, had for many years past be notorious dealer in slaves at Ambriz. and elsewhere; that he carried on, from 1848 to May, 1855, very little, if any other trade, than the slave trade. The 11th p leaded that in the end of' the year 1851 or beginning of 1852 an association was formed at Rio de Janeiro, with branches at Lisbon, Cuba, and elsewhere, for the purposes Of carrying on the slave-trado from the West Coast of Africa to the Havannab on a large scale ; the 12th, that some time in the year 1852 Gorrido wras appointed by Flores to act as his.agent, especially in various slave-dealing transactions, and in the month of September, 1853, was sent from Loanda to Baltimore and New York as such ag ent, and thence he was sent by Flores to Cuba; the 15th, that Gorrdo, while so at Cuba, got up or formed a company for the importation of slaves from West Africa into Cuba, by or through the means of Flores, denominated "The Havannalh and Loanida Company." It was not statedl that the appelants took any parxt in those transactions, or that those facts were known to them in any way. The 14th ar-
tide1eaded that Gorrido introdluced Flores to Pinto, Perez, tand s. in 1832 ; the 15th, that Gorrido, after his arrival in London from Cuba in the early part of 1854 was on intimate terms of associationi with Pinto, Perez, and Co., and frequently visited and dined with them, or some of them, andl %that it became and was well known to somne or maore of the firm that Flores and Gorrido had been and then were engased in slave-trading;- the 16th, that Guimarae and Co.. of Rio deJaneiro, mentioned in ~neof the exhibits annexed to he p elans'allegation, bad been for many years - gaged in te slave trade; the 17th, that Raphael de Toea, ef the Havannsh, several times mentioned m the exhibaits, was for some time beforo 1851 and down to 1854 extensively engaged in the slave trade ; the 18th, that in the years 1851 1853. and 1854 a correspondence was carried on between the Portuguese and British Governments on the subject of Flores and his transactions in the slave trade, in consequence whereof the Portuguese Governmenit issued a Royal order, dated the 14th day of February, 1854, banishing him from the province of Angola and from all. the territories of Portugal beyonLd the seas; the 19th, that in the month of M)arch, 1854, Pinto, Perez, and Co., by the directions or with the knowledge of Gorrido, who was then in London, purchased on acount of Flores, and shipped on board the Deslandes, a, cargo consisting of goods commonly used in the slave trade; and that he shipped from Ambriz several cargoes of slaves for the island of Cuba; the 20th, that Flores arrived in London in May or June, 1856 ; that lie was visited by somne of the firm of
rnsno, rerez, and Co., that he frequently dined at their private houses, and pleced his son in their counting-house
to learn their business. He (Dr. Twiss) must ask for a mor
specific statement as to dates. The 21st article pleaded that previously to the spring of 1855 Ambriz was in the territory of a native African chief, and in IMay of that year was forcibly taken possession of by the Portuguese Government; the 22d, that the appellants, Manuel Perez Lozans, Joze Maria Perez, nd Imanuel Perez, at the time of shipping the cargo, well knew that Arnbriz was a place notorious for slave-dealing; that Floreg bad batracoons and slaves there; the 23dl, that the cargo bad been put on board in violation of the sttute. The grounds on which he (Dr. Twiss) asked their Lordahips to rejoect the allegation alto gether were that if all the facts were proved they would not establish what was stated as an inference of law, that these parties knowingl and wilfully shipped the cargo on board m violation of the law. Although there were one or two parts of the allegation -which were admisnble, yet he submitted that their Lordshipe would reject the greater part of it. If the allegation were adu2tte, then the appelladtg must consider whether they must not plead agin. If he was right in supposing that the allegation only iaid grounds for suspicion, tuen their Lordships would hesitate in adving Her faesty to take prooeeding so exoeedingly harsh as theae. If the true lasuewas whetherthe captors were to be exempted from ecoet and damages, some mode might be arrived at byvwhich that question might be raisdi a
tended that the appellants were enaged la lafrnl trHoic,
Dr. Lnlsw}ssroyX dallied the Judgment of their Lord.
abips without hearing Counsel for the respondents, and said, -he prwent quesion arose lpon the admissibility of I allegation which had been offered on behalf of the Crown in upport of a decree made by the Vice-Admiralty Court of St. Helena, whereby thisvessel Was condemned an4 certain penalties imposed on Messrs. Pinto, Perez, and Co., the shippers of the cargo. The conclusion had been come to in the court below on no Tery plain evidence, and the parties agreed to appeal to this Court, t Ihat they inJnd he an opportunity of giving in a complete nd Lu defence. They gave in an allegation consistine% of no less than 14 articles, in which they set forth fully iteir cse, an li deavoured to establish theirexemption from nyaeu biad te in the transaction. In answer to that the presenfallegation was now offered, and two objections had been taken to it by counsel. It was said that the allegation, if fullr proved, would not be sufficient to s,-ow that the peres had contravened the provisions of the 4th George.Cap. 113; and, further, it was urged that sarticularparts o tbe allegation were unnecessary, and likely to lead to expense. Their Lordshipe could not speo;
late upon the strength of the evidence which would be pro. duced, and they were of opinion that the allegation ought to be admitted. It must also be borne in mind that with regard to tranactions violatng a setatute they were of a clandestine nature, and an article that eppalred icarcy of importance might, when the facts were brought out, be of great moment. Bearing in nind these condsderation, their
ordshipe did not think that the objections to any part of the algation had been sustained.

HOUSE OF LORDS 'FF 17
Their Lordships sat this morning for the purpose of hearing appeals, the LoztD CA4NC=LLOR, Baron wxzsLEYDALE, and two other lords being present.
X'EWAI V 3IR JAIZS CAWIrmLL AMD oTfR.s
Mr. Holt and hr. Roxburgh appeared for the appellantand the Attorney-General and Ir. Anderson were counsei for tho respondents.
This was an appeal from adecision of the FirstDivision of the Court of Session in Scotland, afi alinn interlocutcr pronounecd by the Lord Ordinary on the 20th of July,
153, in a ction brought by the appeDant against the respondents, as members of the provisional committee of a projected railway, caUed the Lanark, Stirling, and Clackmannan Connties Junction Railway, to recover a sum of 6171 9s 7d. alleged to be due to him for services rendered and money paid for the respondents' use.
It appeared from the case as stated by the appelant's counsel that in the year 1845 several gentlemen, proprietors of lands in the connties of Lanark, Stirling, and Clack. mannan, formed the project of constructing a railway through part of those counties so asto connect the principal towns, the nndertaking to be called the Lanark, Stirling, and Clackmannan Counties Junction Railway. A pro. visional committee, including the respondents, was appointed to promote the interests of the company. The appelant was employed by the committee to act as secretary, and by theirdirection, or at least with their knowledge and acquiescence, be proceeded to frame and insert advertisements, attend meetings with engineers, surveyors, and others, and perform the whole busmess and duties devolving upon a secretary to a company of this description from otober, 1845, until May, 1849. The respondents were publicly advertised and alowed themselves to be held forth as members of the provisional committee, and had corresponded with the appellant as their secretary relative to the business of the company. Onthe action being brou ht in May, 1852, before the LordOrdinary, hedecidedthat the appellant's statement, necessary in an action brought in a Scotch courtk of the grounds of his action was not sufficient, inasmuch as he had not set forth how, when, and where he had received the personal authority of each of the several respondents, authorizing him to perform each particular act for which he sought to charge them. n consequence of this alleged insufficiency, the appellant was not permitted to adduce evidence in support of his case, and the action was dismissed with costs. That decision having been appealed against, the Court of Session delivered the interlocutor now appealed from in December, 1853, aflirming the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary. The contention on the part of the appellant was that as there were distinct issues of fact upon the record, he had a right to go into the case so far as regarded those issues; that he baving been employed as secretary by the committee, or some agent of the committee, to perform certain acts, and the committee having knowrh of and acquiesced in those acts, must be liable to the appellant for his services, and for the money expended in their performance. It was also urged that the parties having revised their condescendence and answers, and the cause having been bronght on for trial, the respondents were too late to take any objection as to the relevancy of the appelant's averments.
The contention on the part of therespondents 'was that the appellant could not sue them s a body, but only as individuals, and even then he could sue them only for the expenses of the particular acts they had each personally erdered him to perform. In the case of "Hutton v. Bright," in which judgmient was given in the House of Lords in June, 1852, it was decided that no member of a provisional committee was liable for anything ordered by tho committee unless he had himself personally and particularly ordered such act to be performed. The appelant's action having been brought against the respondents as members of the provisional committee, and not as individuals, it was urged that the Lord Ordinary 'was right in deciding that the appellant's averments were irrelevant and insuficicent to support his action. The allegation of the irrelevancy of the appellant's averments vras made at the earliest moment it was in the power of the respondents to
The hearing of the arguments in this case bad not quite concluded when the House adjourned. The further hearing will be resumed on Thursday next.

LAW REPOBT.
COURT OF CHANCERY, INcoLN's-0-T. FEB. 17-
HOPWOOD V. IHOPWOOD.
(Before the LORDS JUsTICES of APPEAL.)
- -us us i nbs appeal trom a decision of the Master of the Rolls were stated in Th7e Times of the 29th of January. The question was whether the Rev. F. G. Hop wood was entitled to a legacy of 5,000L, given to him by his father's will, and also a sunm of equal amount covenanted by the
stator to be paid to certain trustees, orwhetbertheonewas not a satisfaction or adexnption pro tanto of the other. The Master of the Rolls decided in favour of double portions; the other parties appealed.
The Attorney-General, Mr. Follett, and Mr. Karslake appeared for the appellant; Mr. Roundell Palmer and Mr. Little supported the decision of the Master of the Rolls.
Lord Justice KN GaT BRucz said that the question migh' without any disadvantage be represented to be whetber when the testator became a party to the settlement, he intended that the legacy of 5,6001. given by the will shbold be satisfied or adeemed and his Lordship was satisfied upon a consideration or the whole will and three codicils that the testator intended his son, Mr. F. G. Hlopwood, to take both benefits. The consequence of this would be that the appeal must be dismissed.
Lord Justice TuRN-XE said the case Was Tery peculiar in its circumstances, and had it come before him in the first instance be was not sure that he should not have held that an ademption was intended, and that the case was within the influence of the cases against double portions. As, however, his own opinion was not a very strong one, and his learned brother and the Master of the Rolls concurred in one vieW, he should not further enter into the discussion. The appeal would be dismissed, but without costs.
XX PARTE MIARCUS, Dr RP; THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK.
Mlr. W. D. Lxwss said the application of Mr. Marcus was for leave to appeal to the House of Lords against their Lordships' decison refusing to annul the adjudication.
Lord Justice RKNIGw BRRucE-And why not appeal?
Mr. GIFF ARD.-There ara many reasons, but at present it is sufficient to say that the directors have not been served with notice of this apphicaon. This appeared upon the
ongial hearing of Mr. Marcus's petition.
ord Justice KNIGHT BRucE.-I do not see that the objection is of much weight, but perhaps the Lord Justice does.
Lord Justice TURNER.-My impression is that the service is necessary, but whether it is or not, if we consider the question a proper one to go to the House of Lords, there the matter must go.
MIr. GnrFARD.-Our arguments will, I hope, satisfy the CoutA that the question is one which ought not to go to the House of Lords at all.
Lord Justice KIonciT BRRUMX-Persuade us of that, if either of the parties wish it, and you will do a great

MOSTYN.
Mr. W. WELLINGTON COOPER appeared (yesterday and to-day) in support of a motion on behalf of Mr. William Edwards, a judgment creditor, to the amount of 2,4001., of Lord Most7n, that he might be at liberty to appear on and defend an assue at law directed by the Lords Justices in the place of Ann Griffiths and Griffith Griffiths, or that he nmght attend by counsel thereat. The learned counsel stated that the dates to which the attention of the Court would be called would show that there was ample ground for the application.
thIi* BACON, on behalf of tho Hon. Mr. Lloyd Mostyn, the eldest son and heir-at.law of Lord MostYn, the purchaser of the debt due to Miss and Mtr. Griffiths, said he objected in liminc to the motion, on the ground that the Court of Appeal in Bankruptcy had no juradiction to hear an original motion. The bankrnpt laws gave Do auch authosity.
Lord Justioe KNIGH BRUCX.-We think tbe4'otion should proceed. We sTe the point, and wUll state our determination at tbe close of the arguments on the merits.
MIr. WXLLINGTON CooPER sad that Lord Mostyn was adjudicated bankrupt on the petition of Ann Grifliths and Griffith Griffiths so long ago as January 17, 1853, asd on the 27th it war sanuiled by the commisdoner at liverpooL On the appeal by the petitioning creditors the Lords Justices, on the bth of March in that year, discharged the order to annul, and referred tbe matter back to the commissioner. Lord Nostny en the 18th of the nme 3nonth, comiuenced an action ag;(nat the seDner, Gaskel, fortaking bis goode. On tbe 18th of Way notic of adjudication was ordered to be insertd in the Gazet)of the24th of Uth month. On tha 30th the lords Justices directed the rnaa
of the petitioning e9ditors to be subtituted for the name
of the maessnger, and on the 16th of June, 153, issue was joined in tho action, ana notice Of trial was given. trom that day to this On various frivolous pretences, the trial bhad been postponed, so that there had been an unwarrantable delay oi a perioa of no le than three year
and a-half. esides this delay the Court had been informed that the eldest son and heir apparent of the bankrupt had bought uP the debt and was now the defendant in the action, and he had discharged the former solicitor and had substituted Messr. Lnwranee and CO. Mr. Ed. wards had himself unsuccessfully petitioned for adjudication, and had written letters to Lord Mostyn asking for payC-ent of his debt, and offering to take it by easy in. stainents, but could obtain no satisfactio.ib
Lord Justice R.NIGHT BRUc.-Here the father is a peer and does not wish to be made bankrupt, and his eldest son and hei-r apparent is his adversary. The Court has directed an action to try the validity of the adjudication, and it is supposed tuat the Court would be satisfied with a verdict pronounced n such a state of the record. The action this Court directed to be tried was one between Lord d e ostyn and the Griffithses, but this is one between hii and his son.
or. BAcon said that independeatly of the preliminary objection he had stated there was no reason wby the motion should be successful, for the Court would not assume that there was any improper motive for the purchase of the debt by Mr. Mlostyn. If after the trial the Courb saw any reason to be dissatisfied they could express their disapprobation, All that the father and son wished was that the queston should be fairly and fsuly argued. Mr. Edwards, with a candour which was very unusual, stated in his affidavit that he had written two letters offering to give time and to retire from aU proceedings if he were paid his debt, or, in other words, had tried what extortion wouldI do and had failed. The statute law forbade any compliance with his demand, and so failing, he had the assurance to come and make this motion, whlich ought to be at once refused, andI with costs.
Lord Justice TuR-NEi-Were you ever bondi fide proceeding to try the action ?
Mir. BAcoN.-.-Yes; briefs are delivered, the witneswse are subpoenaed, and the case is in the paper for trial on Thursdlay next. The dlelay has arisen from an endeavouir to settle the matter, but, as that is not now possible, the trial 'wil proceed.
Lord Justice KrionHT BRucE.-As this is an action, I do not think the judge will allow a third party to intervene. AppAation can be made to-day to the Lord Chief Baron on
Mr. oxB~uRnG who appeared for Lord Moetyn to oppose the mnotion, suggested that the name of Yr. Edwards could be added to the record as a defendant, and the trial mnight take place with only a delay of a few days, every facility in the mieantime being afforded to MTx. Edlwards.
Their LoRDSIlPS were of opinion that while their former order existed this Court had ample jurisdiction to hear the matter, and ultimately anA order was made that Mr. Edwards should be made a defendant in the action, and that the other parties should consent to such an order as that Mr. Edwards should be at liberty to defendl separately from the other defendant.

PALN V. COOM1
This case was resmned and concluded. The bill was filed by a lessee, for the specific performance of an alleged agreement for a lease for 14 years, if the defendant, the landlord, should so long live, of a farm near Salisbury. The plaintiff's case was that, although the agreement was not signed, he had taken possession under it wnth the assent of the landlord, who knew of its provisions ; that he had, moreover, paid 4751. to the defendant on account of stock in the farm; and that there was perfect certainty in the agreement as to the rent to be paid, the term of years for which the lease was to be granted, and the property to be demised. The defendant, on the other hand, contended that there was no such agreemnent proved as that alleged by the plaintiff; that the latter had been let into possession on the understanding that the terms of the lease should be a subject for future consideration; that the plaintiff had so inismanaged the farm as that ho wvould have incurred a forfeiture of his lease if any such lease had existed; and that on these grounds the biUl should be dismissed.
Mtr. Malins and Mr. Townsend were for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bacon, M r. Toulmin, and Mr. G. M. Giffard for the defendant.
The VIcR-CHANCxLLon said that, although there was a great evil in attempting to stretch the jurisdiction of the Court in cases where p art performance was held to take a parol agreement out of the Statute of Frauds, yet that where sin this case, on such an azreement a tenant had been let into possession by a landlora who had received payment on account of stock taken by the tenant, and the rent, the term of years, and the subject-matter of the lease were certain, it would be a great injustice to allow possession to be disturbed. The evidence as to the alleged mismanagement of the farm by the plaintiff wasnot of that character which would Justify the Court in refasing relief to the plaintiff. On the whole case he thought the plaintiff entitled to a decree for specific performance, with costs.
(Before Vicc.Cheance&or Sir W. P. WOOD.)
UIPSCOMB V. THE PORTSTiOUTH RAULWAY COMPANjY.
Mr. CA1B;s and Mr. SouTrss.rx moved, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that the above company might be restrained from proceeding with the construction of their railway over certain lands, mentioned in the biUl, until they had taken proper steps to determine, by the verdict of a jury or by arbitration, the amo4nt of the purchase-money to be paid for the lands, and paid or secured such purchase-money, in accordance with the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, or until they should have proceeded under the 85th clause of the same act; and also to restrain them from retaining possession of the lands, or any part thereof. The plaintiff, Mrs. Lipscomb, who was atated to be a lady 86 years of age, is the equitable tenant for life, under the will of her late husband, of certain lands in the parishes of Liss and Steep, in the county of Hants, and her co-plaintifIs are parties beneficially interested under the will after her decease. In the month of September, 1853, an agreement was come to between the company of the one part and the trustees of the will in question and Mrs. Lipscomb of the other part, whereby it was agreed that the company should pay to the trustees the sum of 1001. per acre, and so in proportion for any lesser quantity which might be requiredfor the purposes of the raiy, and other clauses were contained in the agreement which it is unnecessary to notice, except so far as that the plaintiffs' counsel contended they were such as no parties having only a limited interest could, under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act, have properly entered into. No steps were ta-en by the company on this agreement, but the company on the 1st of July, 1856, served Mrs. Lipscomb with the usual printed notice to treat, signed by the secretary to the company, annexed to which notice was a scheduledescribing the land required tobe taken, amounting to somewhat more than three acres, and also the usual schedule of claim to be filed in by the owner or occupier. This claim was accordingly filled in by Mrs. Lipscomb, who claimed a sum of 1,2151. lOs. for land and damages, and made certain other requirements, and also nominating her agent to treat for the sale. No further proceedings took place till some time afterwards, when the company set up the existence of the agreement of the 26th of September, 1853, and under it claimed the right to take not only the land fequired for the purpose of the railway, but also a further portion bevered by the line of railway, amounting in the whole to nine acres or thereabouts, and on the 10th of January, 1857, paid the sum of 9411. 5s. into court, under the 75th section of the act, still insisting on the agreement, which was disputed by the plaintiffs as having been waived by the notice to treat. On the 20th of January, 1857, the company attempted to enter on the lands, but were opposed by the tenant, with whom, however, they afterwards agreed for his compensation, and commenced constructing their railway. The trustees of the will were no parties to the suit.
Mr. ROLT and Mr. GIFFARD on behalf of the compan
contended that it was impossibie to make any order on the present motion in the absence of the trustees of Mr. Lips. comb's wfill, who were parties to the agreement of 1853 and who, according to the construction of the wiU contended for by the company, had vested in them a full power of sale of the lands in question whollyirrespeotive of the provisions of the act. As to the company proceeding under the 85th Section, it would be impossible to do so while that agree-ment was in existence; and, although the plaintiffs now repudiated that agreement, there was no reason why the trustees might not choose to keep the company to it. As to the notice to treat being an abandonment of the agreement, that notice had merely been given from excess of caution and to meet the possibility of agreements made b
the company with divers landowners besides the plaintiff aloncg the line of railway not being held valid. If the injunci on were to be granted the damage to the company
contractors wVhich it wohulyd beeitnhen nimpsibefr thgbl emet vto
The VICE-CINIACELLOR, after adverting to the facts of the case, said that, under all the circumstances, there could be no question that as between the company and Mrs. Lips. comb the notice to treat served upon her and the claim sent in by her must be taken to be an abandonment of the agree. ment of 1853. It would be very hard on landowners if companies were to be allowed to turn round as this company now proposed to do. As to the trustees, it was not pretended that they had ever insisted upon the validity of that agreement, and the objection urged by the company that they were not before the Court was open to the observation that they had taken no pains to ascertain the wishes of the trastees upon the subject. At the same time the company should not be embarrassed by the possibility of the trustees insisting on the agreement of 1853, and therefore the proper order to make would be an interim order in the terms of the injunction, to extend over Friday, the plaintiffs undertaking to bring the trustees before the Court by amendment in the meantime, and to abide by any order which the Court might make as to damages.

}HUNFREY V. DALE AND OTHERS.
(S&ing. at "i# Prius, before Lord OAMI'BELL Tnd
Specid Jurica.)
mr. beieanzngozz na Mr. isempLay appeared for the Elaintiff; and Mr. Bovifl5 Q. C. and Mr. Henry James for the
efendants.
The plaintiff, Charles Hnmfrey, was a person engaged in the oil and tallow trade, and he sued the defendants, Elesrs.
Dale, Miorgan, and Co., brokers in the oil trade, to recover damuages for the breach of a cortract in which She defendants 1ad entered, on tha 14th of August, 1S55, for the purchase f 1Otonsofhinseed oil of the plaintiff, at 44. per ton. The defendants pleaded that they did not make the eon~
It appeared that on the day in question the plaintiff's brokers applied to the defendants, and informed them that they were sellers of a large quantity of oil, and asked if they could obtain a buyer. The defendants said they could, provided they were allowed i per cent. commission, it being customary, where a broker acted for both parties, that the usual commission of d per cent. ehould be divided between the brokers. The plaintiff's broker consented, and it was then agreed that the oil should be bought, and that the defendants should pass the contrAct. The defendants accordingly made out a "sold note," and sent it to the plaintiff's brokers, and they also made out a " bought note," and sent it to Mr. Schenk, their principal. Both notes were signed by the defendants, "Dale, Morgan, and Co., brokers." In the "sold noW' sent to the plaintiff's brokers it was stated that the defendants, Dale, Morgan, and Co., were to receive i per cent. commission, and in the " bought note" sent to Mr. Schenk it was stated that they were to receive l per cent. comm'ssion. On the 18th of January, 1856, which was before "the prompt," the defendants wrote a letter to the plaintiff; discosing the name of their principal,Mr.Schenk. Butin the meantimetheprice of oil had fallen about 81. per ton, and a day or two after Schenk became insolvent. The plaintiff refused to accept Schenk as a purchaser, and sued the defendants upon the ground that, according to the custom of the oil trade, when a broker entered into a "close contract"-viz., where the name of the principal was undisclosed-he made himself personally liable upon the contraot. Upon the trial of that action the plaintiffgave evidence to prove the existence of the custom, and obtain'ed a 'v6rdoct. Subsequently the Court of Queen's Bench held that the verdict could not be disturbed. The present was a second action arising out of the same facts, and founded upon one of the sold notes nade at the same time. Witnesses were called by the plaintiff as at the previous trial to establish the custom on *hich the plaintiff relied. They stated where a broker entered into a " close contract" he was always hold personally liable.
The defence was that there was no such custom in the trade as would make the defendants personally liable on such a contract as the present; and several witnesses were called to prove that where a broker made a " close contract" he was at liberty, at any timn before " tho prompt," to disclose the name of his principal, and so to release hunself from all liability.
Lord CAMPBELL, in summing up the evidence, said ho thought the custom, if established, was a reasonable custom, for the broker knew who his principal was, and it was for him to disclose the name of his principal or not, as he might think proper. There was also a good consideration for the promise, for the defendant was to receive altogether three-quarters per cent. commission. His Lordship was about to read over the evidence, but was informed by the jury that it was unnecessary, as they had made up their minds to find a verdict for the plaintiff.
They accordingly found for the plaintiff-Damages, 9r7yl in,
Lord CAMPBELL then said he thought the defendant had done very ill in defending the action, and that the time of the Court had been wasted. There had already been another action tried between the same parties, on the trial of which all the points were reserved for the opinion of the Court, and all the Court were of opinion that the action was maintainable, and that there was no defence. The defendant had to-day undertak-en to disprove the existence of the custom; but the jury had come to the conclusion that the usage did exist.
EICKS (ADMINUSTRATRxI) V. THE XMYPOlT, ABERGA-
VENNY, AND nEREFORD RAILWAY COMIPANY.
Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. bfellor, Q.C., Mr. Phipson, and the Hon. G. Denman for the defendants.
This was an action in which the plaintiff, as administrataix of her deceased husband, Mark Hicks, sued the Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford Railway Company to recover compensation in damages for the death of her husband, who was kiled on the 12th of November, 1856, in a collision which took place on that day on the company's line.
Sir F. THESIGER, in opening the case, said the action was brought for the benefit of the plaintiff and her children, to recover compensation for the death of her husband, who vas killed in consequence of the very gross negligence of the company's servants. The deceased was a commercial traveller, and in the course of his business he was going by an express train from Hereford to Newport. It appearedi that on the morning of the day in question-the 12th of November-there had been an accident upon the line at Pontypool by a goods train running into a passenger train. An obstruction was thus created, which also caused the usual driver to be taken from the express train. The deceased was congratulating himself that he had not gone by the earlier train, little foreseeing the consequences that were about to ensue. The train proceeded, and in the course of the journey the left hand leading wheel of the engine lost its spring, which dropped off. The man who was at the time acting as driver of the engine had only 12 days before been a stoker, and he made no attempt to repair the damage, but proceeded on his journey. When the train arrived at Nantyderry the line formed a double curve, called an S curve, and when the engine arrived on the left-hand side of this curve, in consequence of the absence of the spring, the engine ran off the line, and dragged after it four or five carriages. The coupling-irons were broken, and one of the carriages, in which the deceased was,was castonto the up-line. Whilematterswere in thiss ate. a goods train was seen advarncing, and was already within quarter of a mile of the spot. The station-master endeavoured to Etop the train, but it was impossible to stop such a train in less tnan three-quarters of a mile, and the consequence was that the train ran into the carriage in which the deceased was, crushed it to piecss, and so mutilated and disfigured the deceased that he could only be identified by his clothes. In the first instance the company denied that there had been any negligence, but that was now admitted, so that the jury would be discharged from any duty on the part of the case. The action was brought nuder the 9th and 10th of Victoria, chap. 93, for the benefit of the plaintiff, as administratrix, and her four children. The decesmed was 48 years of age, and at the timie of his death he was in the receipt of a salary of 5501. ayear, out of which he had to pay his hotel and travelling ,&penses during his absence on his journeys, which occupfld about 300 days in the year. Ie also had an engagement with another house, from whom he received a percentage on what he sold.
Several witnesses were examined in support of the *beve case. It appeared that the deceased had insured his life for 1,0001. in a company which insured against accidents by railways! ana he had also insured his life for 9991. in various insurance companies. The deceased was 48 years of age, and his expectation of life, according to the Carlisle Tables, was 22 years After paying all his personal expenses, it was stated he would have about 3511. a-year sur.
plus applicable to the support of his family, and it was conand, ythe plaintiffs counsel that the amsount of pecuniary compensation which his family ought to receive should the present value of an annuity of ;3511. a-year for 22 years. This was calculated to amount to about 10 years' purchase.
Mr+. MiELLOR, in addressing the jury for the defendan,ts, said, the defendants were ready to make a reasonable compensation to the family of the deceased, hut he contendedi that the amount to which the family was entitled under the several policies ought to be deducted. Hle also contended that it ought not to be assumed that a commercial traveller, 48 years of age, would be able for 22 years to earn such a salary as was stated, and that the jury, in estimating the damages, ought to take into their consideration all the uncertainties of his life, health, and employment.
Lord CAZIPBF'LL, in summing Up the evidence, said he thought it was to the credit of the railway company that they had admitted their liability, and called upon the jury to give an adequate compensation to the family of the deceased. In estimating the damges the jury ought to consider, not the wants of the family, but the pecuniary loss which they had sustained by the death of the deceased. His Lordship advised the jury to take a reasonable view of the case, and give a fair compensation; and he thought they ought to make a deduction from the amount in consideration of the premiums which if the deceased had not met with the accident he would have had to pay upon the policies.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 2,5001., which they apportioned thus :-One-third to the widow, and the remainder to be equally divided anaong the four children.
RIDWAY V. O'COHNOH.
Mr. Mi. Smith, Q,C., and Mr. J. Brown appeared for the laintiff; and Mr. Bovill, Q.C; and theEn. G. D e
lrthe defendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant for not indemnifying him against certain bils of exchange. The question arose out of some transactions with the Sierra Nevada Lake Water and Mining Company, of which company the defendant was the original promoter.
The plaintiff was exanmined in support of his case, but, at the close of his examination,
Lord CAImBSfLi. intimated his opinion that his evidence did not make out the case stated in the declaration.
After some discussion the plaintiff was nensuited.
SECOND COURT.
(Vitting$ at Nisi Prius, before Mr. Justice ERLE and SpeciaZ
Juries.)
ROBERTS V. HA.ILToN.
Mr. Huddleston was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Prentice for the defendant.
The declaration stated that one Russell bad recovered a judgment against Roberts, and that he (Roberts) had satisfied that judgment, but that the defendant malicously and without probable cause issued a ca. sa. and pcocured Roberts to be arrested and imprisoned. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty," and alleged that the
laintiff had not satisfied Russell the money due to
The plaintiff was a farrier, carrying on business in Brownlow-mews, Bedford-row; and the defendant was an attorney, practisingimBedford-row. There had been some dealings oetween ussel, who was a publican, and Roberts; they went to Hamilton, who prepared a warrant of attorney, but ultimately Roberts paid BusseD al the money that was due sto him, and Russell told him the warrant of attornev was destroyed and burnt. Afterwards Russell fell into difldcul-
ties and inurred a debt to Roberts. It would seem, azcording to the statement of the learned counsel, that Russell b came dissatisfied with Hamilton, and kept bis whereabouts concealed from him. Russell and Roberts settled all the ccounts between them, but one day the plantiff and the defendant met, when the defendant told him if he did not account to bi£m for what he owed Russell he should have him up to Bow-street on a charge of embezzlement, but the defendant never suggested that the warrant of attorney had been satisfied, A correspondence then took place between the plaintiff's attorney and the defendant. On Christmas-eve, after the law offices had closed for the Vacation, a ca. sa. ;having been issued by the defendant, Roberts was taken in execution, and kept in prison nntil the 8th of January, when the parties went before Mr. Justice Erle, under whose ordertheplaintiff was dis¢harged.
This action was then brought to recover damages for this arrest and imprisonment.
Very many witnessess were caUed with a view of making out the statement of the learned counseL
For the defendant it was stated that there were two questions for the consideration of the jury :-First, whether there was any money due on the warrant of attorney at the time of the arrest; and, secondly, whether Hamilton, at the time he acted as the attorney for Russell, in arresting Roberts, knew that no money was due on the warrant of attorney, because the plaintiff could not recover unless he proved that nothing was due, and that he was maliciously and improperly arrested by the defendant, he the defendant, knowing that nothing was due upon the warrant of attorney. It was urged that a more grossly unfounded case was never brought before a jury. It was alleged that the plaintiff and Russell wished the warrant of attorney to be prepared for a snm of 1001. in order that the creditors migbt be defeated, but Hamilton would not lend himself to so improper a transaction, and insisted upon its being made as a secarity for 401. only-the sum which was actually due. That money had never been paid upon this warrant of attorney to his knowledge, but that he bad received instructions from his client Russell, upon which he had acted. It was not now known where RusseU was.
Witnesses were called, and affidavits were put in to support the defondant's case.
The interest of the case to the public does not justify a longer report; the verdict alone is of consequence to the parties.
The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.
This Second Court will not sit again until further notice.

COURT OF COMMON PLRAS. (4ITTT.)ITAT.T. V 17
IMMU2n-G V. LECGARD.
(Sittings at Nisi Priu, before the Lom) Cnmp JUsTicE
and Snecial Auriea.
mr. Serieant Byles, Air. Powell, and Mr. Brown were counsel for the plaintiff- Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. Crossm appeared for the defendant.
This was an action upon a contract for the erection of an iron church for the defendant for 7507.
It appeared that the plaintiff is a manufacturer of iron buildings at Bow, near Bristol, and, among others, has erected churches at Aldershott and at Kensington for Archdeacon Sinclair. Thedefendant isabenevolent lady of fortune residing near Filey, in Yorkshire. Being desirous of building a church upon the coast there, she applied to the defendant for that purpose, and ultimately ordered the church in question. The plaintiff's estimate for such work was at about 21. per sitting, and this church, which was to accomrnodate400 persons, was to cost7501. It appeared that the site upon which it was to be built was expected by the defendant to be given by a Mr. Hewlet. This person, however, entertained an objection to iron churches, and refused to consent to allow an iron church to be put up on his land, and Miss Legard found herself in the dilemma of having an iron church on her hands and no place whereon to put it up. She had subsequently procured a conveyance of other land to herself, and was now ready and willing to accept this church, according to contract - but the question was whether she had not, by her conduct and correspondence with the plaintiff, before she acquired the new site, repudiated her contract.
On the part of the plaintiff, a long correspondence dislosing the contract, was read to the jury.
The plaintiff said he had laid out 4501., and that every part of the church was packed up and taken off his premisea.
This being the plaintiff's case,
Mr. KoNvLES thereupon objected that there was a varianee between the contract alleged and the evidence, which could aot be amended; and that upon that ground the defendant was entitled to a verdict on a plea denying the contract, and on a special plea.
The (lsHDsF JusTIcE said the special plea was not consistent with the truth; and that if Mr. Knowles relied on the facts therein alleged by the defendant they were against her; and suggested that, supposing the plaintiff had amended his declaration, the defendant would have been out of court
After some discussion as to the amendment,
TheCOsins JUSTICE said,-You see, Mr. Knowles, the defendant has put in a plea to take advantage of an omission, knowing that the facts cauld not be supported bv the evidence. This gentleman has built the church for 7501., and is ready to erect it. You say, true, the plaintiff has built the church, but he is not ready to erect it; but that issue it does not seem you can support.
The special plea was then abandoned.
Mr. KNows.ss then said he would take the opinion of the juryas to whether this lady had broken her contract.
The Canr JUSTICE suggested that the jury should say whether the contract was broken. It would be a great pity, as the church was built, and the defendant, who had given the order for the church for a laudable motive, was rceady to acep it, that it should not be erected. Ile (the
suggested that, upon the understanding that the plaintiff should erect the church, the jury, in the event of their finding for the plaintiff, should give nominal damages.
This p reposal was acceded to.
Mr. KNOWLXS then contended there was nothiin the correspondence to show a repudiation.
The defendant's attorney was then caUed to prove that after the writ and declaration were served he had interviews with the plaintiff's attorney and foreman, in the couse of which he, the witness, had said that Miss Legard had no idea of breaking her contract; that the site was then ready, and the church might be sent down by the next express-train; and that it was arranged that the proceedings should be supnded.
hlssLegard was examined, and witnesses were recaUed for the plaintiff to oontradict parts of the evidence for the defendant, and the case became very complcated and embarrassing.
The CbIEF JusTICE told the jury the only question for them was whether this lady had broken her contract. It was a question for them whether the letter of the 7th of November, in which she wrote that the only question then was what compensation the plaintiff would require, was not a distinct intimation to him that she could not take the church. The plaintiff was not affected by anything she might have done in obtaining the fresh site. No one could doubt this action ought never to have been brought. There was a little blame on both sides. The manner of the defendant's attorney, neither at the plaintiff's establishment nor at his attorney's, had been conceiatory, and had not produced the effect a more conciliatory tone would probably have produced. But, no doubt, Miss Legard was a lady of high position, and her solcitor was a mau of respectability. Although, in the event of the jury fLndin-g their verdict for the plaintiff, it might be a matter of regret to them that the costs of this action wouald go to those who, to say the least, ought to have exercised a better discretion, they (the jury) ought not to allow that consideration to influence their verdict.
The jury, after a few minutes' consideration, found their verdict for the plaintiff, with nominal damages as agreed.
M'LNTOSH V. THE LONDON AND NORTH-WESTEn? RAIL-
WAY CO3PANY.
Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Rtaymond were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Phipson ap. peared for the defendant.
Thiswas an action brought againstthe London and NorthWestern Railway Company for negligence in the carriage of the plaintiff as a passenger, by means of which her leg was broken.
The accident, in fact, occurred on the Holyhead and Chester line, but, as the contract was entered into with the defendants, whose carriages travel over the Holyhead and Chester line, the action was brought against the defendants.
Mtr. JAmES, in opening the plaintiff's case, said,-The laintiff is a lady in independent circumstances residing at York-place, Portman-square, and on the 28th of A last took tickets at Euston-square for herself and her daughter to go from London to Aber, in Wales. The train, which was a long one, reached Aber at 8 o'clock. It stopped at the Aber station, and overlapped the platform, and opposite the carriage in which the plaintiff was sitting with her daughter there was no platform, hut an embankment, and the depth from the step to the ground being three or four feet, the ladies were afraid to alight. They had requested to be carried further on to the platform, but this request was refused, and while they were urging their request on one of the officials of the company the train was put in motion, and they were carried 70 or 80 yards beyond the platform to a similar place. They then requested to be taken back to the platform. The request was refused by the station-master. The phaintiff in spite of her remonstrances, was oblged to saght at this spot, nd, although the daughter managed to reach the ground i safeot, the mother in eudesvouring to do the same, with the assistance of the station-master, who insisted there was no danger, broke her leg.
The above is an outline of the facts proved.
Mr. Kemp, a passenger by the train, stated,-The train was a long one, and overlaped the platform at both ends. I hesrda Lady say she wished to get out. On looking outlI saw the door of the carriage open. A lady protested it was dangerous. I saw a porter near. The carriage in which the
lady was was not at the platform. the ground there waa
very rough. There was an embankment sloping down. A person stepping out would step into a hollow between the rail and the embankment. From the step to the bottom would be from four to five feet. It would be about three feet from the second step, sloping into a run for water. The ladies refused to get out there. The porter shut the door. The train started, and the porter signalized to the station-master. Upon this the steam was shut off, but in the meantime the train had moved on beyond the platform, and the ladies were carried beyond the platform. The ground there was similar to where the train stopped at first, and very unsafe to get out. The station-master requested ther to get out. They objected, and Miss lMIntosh said she was sure her mamma could not get out there. Mrs. MrIntoeh a1so protested. The station-master said he could lift Mrs. M'Intodm out. She after that protested against etting out there, and requested that the train might be backed to the platform. On reassurance from the master she came forward, stepped on the step, and threw herself into his arms. I saw herstep forward, and Iimmediatelysawherfall. The stationmsster was holdig up his ars to assist her. She sung out that she had broken her leg .I saw her leg dangling about as if it would come of. Miss Intosh seemed very much alarmed. I volunteered my card, feelig it was gross carelessness, as a witness.
Cross-examined.-It was not level ground where they got out. To the best of my belief there is a bank. Mymemory is pretty good. I made no memorandum, and in the confusion and excitement I do not speak positively.
Mr. BoviLL.-Did you hear the porter call out " Aber, Aber?'-Yes.
The C nF JusTCE.-They generally call it out in such a way that you cannot possibly understand what it is they are calling.
RIe-examined.-It was in my judgment, a very dangerous place for any one to alight yt.
The CVEFr JusTiCe.-Why do you say that? What distance would she have to step down ?
Witness.-I should say three or four feet.
Miss M'Intosh, the plaintiff's daughter, was then called.- The part of the carriage where we were sitting was about 12 yards behind the platform. I caled to the porter to let us out. He opened the door. The ground sloped towards the
ditch. There was no bank where the train first stopped. I requested him to go on to the platform, and said we should break our necks if we attempted to alight. He said nothing, but shut the door, and the train went rapidly on about 80 yards beyond the platform and stopped. It was rough ground there and a sloping bank. The stationmaster, on being several times requested to go back, said there was no danger. I said my mamma was too heavy, but he said there was no danger. Mamma said it was very cruel not to have the train put back, as she was sure she should break her legs. We were compelled to get out there. The stationmaster was bent on it. I gave him my hand and jumped out safely. My mamma put her foot on the step aud said, " I cannot do it." He again said he would life her. He put his arm under my mamma's waist and tried to lift her, but, finding, I suppose, her weight too much, I distinctly saw him drag her. Her foot was on the step. He appeared to drag her forward. She fell, and her leg was broken.
Cross-examined.-Her foot was still on the carriagoe when her leg was broken. I certainly never stated that I attached no blame to the officers of the company and that it was purely an accident through my mamma slipping.
The plaintiff, who was seated in a chair during the trial, confirmed the evidence of her daughter, and said that she took hold of the handle of the door, putting her foot on the step, but was so terrified that she &id not dare venture to alight; that the station-master urged her ; that her weight overowered him, and he then dragged her; that in so doin her foot hung and her leg was broken; that her leg turned under and she exclaimed, "My God, myleg is broken." The witness further stated that she was confined nine days to her bed, and was in splints for 29 days, and stiU suffers very much. She can walk with the aid of a stick, but cannot go up and down stairs. She has incurred 501. expense.
Mr. Anderson a surgeon and a member of the college, who knew the plaintiff before the accident, described the injuries. The fibula was broken, and there was a dislocation. It was a simple fracture, The bones are now united, but there is a puffiness stiU remaining, and the patient still suffers. Her nervous system has been shocked. She was stout before, and is much altered. In six months she may be able to walk welL
To a Juryman.-I saw the leg after the fracture had been reduced. I have no doubt it was bent upon the step.
Witness.-My charge would be 20 guineas for my fee in going to Aber, and probably six guineas more for my espenses.
Cross-examined.-Thelady has rather small bones, and a small, delicate ankle. It was an ordinary recognized form of fracture. The ligaments would be considerably stretched.
This was the plaintiff's case.
It was intimated that no witnesses would be called for the defenoe.
Mr. JAsxs, in summing up the evidence for the plaintiff, remarked upon the impropriety on the part of the company in instructing his friend to put the question put by Mr. Bovill to the plaintiffs daughter-whether she had not told the station-master that it was a pure accident, and not attributable to any fault of the officials of the companywhen the company did not adduce any evidence in support of such allegation. The accident was not a mere casualtyit was the result of gross and scandalous negligence, and called for ample damages.
Mr. BoviLL then addressed the jury for the defence, and contended that there was no ground for saying that there was scandalous negligence on the part of the defendants.
The CmEs JusrTrcn-The question is, hMr. BoviU whether it was not negligence on the part of the company's servants-especially in order to enable a lady to ali ht, who as you say, is unwieldly and has a delicate snideto iace the train in such a position.
4r. Bovin.-The first question is, was there negligence? It so, what are the reasonable danages? Was not the acident to be attributed tothe plaintf herself in first coming forward to alight and then becoming alarmed ?
The CiXF JUSTIoN, in summing up, told the jury, if there was neglgence on the part of the station-master the company wonld be resnonsvle. Upon the facts the first question was whether it was not a breach of duty inthe station-master, when he saw a communication going on at the door of the carnage between the plaintiff and the porter, when the train first stopped, to put the train in motion. Despateh is not to be purchased at the expense of accidents to passengers which reasonable care might pre .The train went on, and it was clear that
lades remonstrated at being compelled to alight at the place where it stopped the second time. The younger lady saw the station-master was determined and jumped out. But the mother continued to remonstrate. Then, while sheis remonstrating, the station-master puts his arm round her waist and drags her. She, apprehensive of danger, resists, her ankle turns round, and the bone snaps. It turns out that in her apprehension of danger the plaintiff was right and the station-master wrong. This lady was conscious of her physical condition. She had no longer the easticity of youth, and apprehenson of danger existed. If the jurythought it was apart of the dutyof astation-master to insist and drag a lady of this description in this manner for the sake of despatch, and that thero was no negligence on the part of the company, their verdict would be for the defendants, It was true this action was not of the same importance to a erson of independent means as to one wiving by industry, but the jury would bearin mindtit was a serious thing even to be in doubt whether the entire use of plimb would everbe reatored.
The jury, after retiring'for about 20 minutes, found their verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 4501., and said they felt there was gross negligence on the part of the station-master in not having the carriage backed to the platform for the lady to alight.

COOPER V. IEA LEy A?XD GREY_ACRr_
(Stings at Nii lPriu, beore the CHiEF BAo;, at
Gui&lhaU.)
-Mr. L Simith and Mr. lannen were counsel for the nlain tiff * Mr O'Mally and Mr. Couch were counsel for the defendant Eeadley; Mr. Manisty appeared for Greenacre.
The plaintiff is one of the messengers of the Court of B kruptc, and this was an action to recover n41, the amount o0 his taxed costs for keeping ossession of the estate of a bankrupt at Cambridge named Busby, the defendants being sued as the trade assignees of that estate. It appeared that Busby was a smal brewer at Cambridge, and that the defendant Headley was his maltster, residing in the same town, while the defendant Greenacre lived in Norfolk, and certaii4 took no part in the working of the estate. As regards ifeadley evdence was given with the view of showing that he was cognizant of and sanctioned the fact that the plaintifi's man had carried on the browery for,the benefit of the ostate,, as the supply of malt had ben obtained from him.
At the close of the case for the plaintiff,
Hr. O'MNALLY objected for Headley that there was no case to go to the jury, Greenacre being clearly entitled to a verdict. The action was brought against the defendants jointly, qua assignees; but it had been decided that no such action could be brought, and that a messenger under the Court of Bankruptcy could only recover his costs from the trade assigness on a special contract, of which no evidence had been adduced by the plaintiff.
Mr. STrm and Mr. HANEN were heard on the other side, and contended that, though there ndght be no evidence against Greenacre, there was sufficient to fix Headley, and tney prayed leave to Amend the record by rejecting (3reenacre.
The CHIFv BARoy, however, was of opinion that no action could be maintained against the defendants without a special contract, and that, as this action ought never to have been brought, he sbould refuse leave to amend, and should direct a nonsuit.
The plaintiff was thereupon nonsuited.
SANGURMI V. RODEn .
Mr. Robinson appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Simon were counsel for the defendant.
The defendant is a "gentleman," living in New Palacechambers, King-street, St. James's, and this was an action to recover 521. 5s., the amount of the plaintiff's bil for clothes supplied to him, to which he pleaded never indebted and payment. The plaintiff carries on his business in Regent-street, and employed one Urdell, who had formerly been in business with one Robinson, in Clifford-street, to solicit business, at a weekly salary and a commission of 7 per cent. on all sums paid to the plaintiff through his agency. Among other orders procured by Urdell were those of the defendant, and when Urdell quitted the service of the plaintiff. on the 11th of August, 1856, a circular was sent to the defendant requiring payment to the plaintiff aSlone. After one or two interviews this action was brought, and in answer to the case of the plaintiff the defendant now proved that, having formerly dealt with Urdell, he had at his request given the orders in question to him on his own account; that he had paid him 30l. on account during the supply, and had returned several garments to the amount of 101, of which he had not seen anything since, thus leaving a balance of U1. only due, as he believed, to Urdell, and not to the plaintiff, with whom he had not had any deslingL
The CEaEF BARox, at the close of the defendant's case, said the plaintiff was only entitled to the balance of 11., as be was answerable for the acts of Urdell, but he should certifs to give the plaintiff his costs, and that on the ground that the defendant ought to have made known to the Wlaintiff the whole case and to have tendered or paid the balance.
Mr. SUION was prepared to produce an affidavit that the defendant had so done.
The CHxi BAXoN.-Well, I will hear your affidavits and dispose of that point on Thursday.
Verdict for the plaintifffor ill.
RICHARDS V. MOORE AND OTERS.
ir. O'Malle nd IMr. Thrmnp wero counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Prideaux ad Mr. oweU appeared for the defendants.
Thiswas an action of trespass, trover, and iDegal distress, to which the defendants pleaded not guilty by statute. The plaintiff is a surgeon, and it appeared that he took a house from a building society called the Third Equitable Union Building Company, of which body the defendants are the trustees. The rent was 45l., and this he paid regularly for a few quarters, when he received a written notice from the secretary that a member of the society named Sully had completed his arrangements as allottee of the house, and that for the future the antiff was to look to him and pay him rent as his landord. The plaintff did both, and was much shocked to find a distress put in on his premises for 361. 5s. by the defeudants on the 16th of August, 1856, a few days only after a half-year's rent had fallen due to Sully, sand without any notice or demand. As the plaintiff owed no such sum, he pad his half-yeaSs rent to Mr. Sully, who first tendered the
ut, and ltimately, on a threat of a sale paid the whole sum, 361. 5s., and the costs to the broker, anA then brought this action in the name of Mr. Richards. The case for the defence appeared to be that Sully was the tenant of the society, and liable, as such, by its rules, to the whole sum for which the distress had been put in. At the conclusion of the case
The CFx BARON expressed the opinion that under all the civcmnstances the plaintiff had a bare right of action, and was entitled to a verdict for nominal damages; but the learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that he was entitledto substantial damages, while his opponent argued
at te defendants were entitled to the verdict. Ultimately it was arranged that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff for l,, with leave on both sides to move.

5IIDDL-ESEX SESSIONA Tucav, PFb. 17.
(Before Mr. PAsHLZy, Q.C., A&qsistnt-Judge.)
Francis Bridges, 32, was indicted for stealing a purse containing 12s. from tho person of Sarah Harriett Purchas. It appeared that on the morning of the 4th of January the prosecutrix, who is the wife of a solicitor at Stroud, Glocestershire, was at St. Andrew's Church, Wells-street, Oxford-street, with her husband. As they were leaving a woman picked her pocket of her purse, which was passed to the prisoner, who was given into custody. The woman mada her escape.
The Jury found the pri3oner Guily. It was proved that he had been sentenoed to three months'hard labour for attempting to pick pockets at the Waterloo station, and that in 1849 he was sentenedel at the Central Criminal Court to one year for felony.
The prisoner admitted these convictions, but denied that he was guilty of this offence. He said that since he had been out of prison he had endeavoured to earn an honest livelihood, but when he got work the police found him out and told his employer that he was a convicted thief, and so got him discharged.
After the prisonerhad p leaded to the charge on Monday be was taken back to the ouse of Detention and placed in a cell in the usual way. About 9 o'clock at night, on the warder on duty passing the cell door he heard groaninF, and on looking through the insection-hole he saw the pnsoner struggling on the floor. He called for assistance, and on opening the door they found that the prisoner had opened veins in both his arms, from which at least a quart of blood had flowed. M\r. Smiles, the assistant-surgeon, was sent for. Ie bound up the wounds, and an offioer was set to keep a strict watch upon him for the remainder of the night, as he had expzessed a determination to accomplish his own destrucijioo. It seems that he broke an eartheu1 pan, such as are USUally supplied to the cells, and with the agged ehnd of one of the pieces attempted to bleed himself
The ASSISTANTJuDGE admonished the prisoner upon tho fresh crime he had attempted, and, having made some observations upon the regulations to which prisoners sentenced to penal servitude are subjected, sentenced him to four years of that punishment.

Mr. Poland prosecuted; Jr. Metealfe appeared for the prisoner.
The Earl of Deart stated that on the night of the 26th of December he was ooming out of the Olympic Theatre, and while looking for his carriage he felt a pull at his watchguard, and at the same moment saw the urisoner's hand seizedbyapoliceman. The watch was in the prisoner's hand, but was not detached from the chain.
Rtalph Crifeld, 115 F, said, he was at the Olympic Theatre on the night in question, and he saw the prisoner trying to force his way to the box entrance. He prevented him, although he said he had a party inside, and diroctly afterwards he saw him close to Lord Desart with his lordshr' watch in his hand. He then took him into custody.
Te jury found the prisoner Guilty.
There was a former oonviction against him, and he was sentenced to 18 monts hard labour.
Julian Payne, 18, was indicted for fraudulently obtaining 66 copies of The Times newspaper from James Monger, with intent to defraud Messrs. W. H. Smith and Son. He p leaded "Guilty," and was sentenced to four months' hard

Watney had improperly assaulted her on two occasions while she was in te service, both of which assertions were denied upon oath, but the prisoner reiterated themP
The jury found her lVot Guilty, after some deliberation,
The ASSISTANT-JUDGE said, he never made observations upon verdicts, and should not even upon that just given.
Mr. GDyFARD said, he had in his hand a letter written by the prisoner from the Honse of Detention, asking forgive. ness for what she had done, and promising to return the stolen pro- ; but out of fairness it had not been made evidence ror the prosecution.

AMLTYIYS and RBPVOL VERS in, GRORGIA
TO TRY EDITOR OF THE TrAES.
Sir,-I have read the letter of Air. J. Arrowsmith dIAted Liverpool, December 10, 1856, and the various other communications and letters touehing the subject of that gentleman's "narrative," in those numbers of Tc Times which have reached this city up to this date.
Mr. Arowsmith reaffirms his statement, notwithatanding my denial, and it would seem that many nerchants of Liverpool, relying upon the respectable standing of Mr. Arrowsmith heretofore, require further proof before they will condemn his narrative as wholly untrue.
I beg leave, out of respect to the merchants of liverpool-indeed, to public opinion throughout your country, and especially to Thle Times-to place before you, in authentic shape, the several depositions of the conductor, the two enginemen, and three firemen who performed this now celebrated trip, and also the deposition of the Government mail agent,who was present during the whole of it; all distinctly denying the narrative of Mr. Arrowsmith.
This testimony, I cannot for a moment doubt, -will satisfy every reasonable person within Her Majesty's dorninions of the absolute and unmitigated falsehood which has been inflicted upon the people cf Britain.
I would not disturb the charitable interpretation -which you have given to Mr. Arrowsmith's conduct; nevertheless, I am solicitous that my denial which, through your kindness, appeared in Tle Times should be supported by positive testimony, no mnatter whether madness or mendacity impelled Mr. Arrowsmith to compose his cruel "narrative."
It should not be forgotten that Mr. Arrowssmitb, in his first letter to The Times avowing the authorship of the " narrative," said he did so reluctantly, and through the advice of friends. In his last letter he again shows that he does not appear of his own free, unbiaswsed wilL.
It is apparent that, through the importunity or under the control of some friend, he has been fastened in a difficulty of his own creation beyond the power of extrication, except upon the kind solution which you have given of the mystery of his motives. I have inquired into the standing and character of Mr. Arrowsmith, :nd learn that he is the nephew of a gentle_an who stands deservedly high and has great influence in the commereial community of Liverpool. It has occurred to me that it is the great respectability and high character of the uncle which throughout this matter have given note to the nephew. An affectionate and unwavering confidence in the truthfulness of his kinsman has probably led the uncle to advise the publication of the narrative as a duty to civilization and Christianity. It is not, I assure you, a gracious task for me to be the means of destroying that confidence, but every liberal-minded person will allow that I have not overstepped the line of strict defence of the character of a State of which I am proud to be a native citizen, and of a public incorporation of which I have the honour to be the head.
With the highest respect,
Your obedijont hlinhhln ,.

Somerset, and Weymouth Company, upon which they pald 4 per cent. per asnum, bhould be added to the afital expended, which would increase the total expenditure from 22ct76,960la to 23,e01,0601. There was an increase of 40,0ddn. ino the consolidated stock; in the estimatedliabsities there was an error of 49,orm1., and in the Oxford and Birmingham lhne 44 t001. more bad been charged than the spersfied amount.

HIe hoped they wold agree t,o the appointment of a committee to investigate the accounts and inquire into the validity of the contract.s
mr. Z3AUNDERS, at the request of the chairman, explained the various i'ems referred to, as the auditors were not prerent. With regard to the Birmingham and Oxford account being more than was estimated by 44,000u., there was 100,0001. of assets to be realized, which would show that the cost would be 56,0001. less, and not 44,0001. more, when the assets were realized. With regard to the estimated liabilities of 350,0001. referred to by the hon. proprietor, and which were estimated by the Consultation Committee in 1849, it showed how carefully the estimate had been made, and that it was ample, for there remained now 89,0001. in reserve. The forfeited sbares were included in the consolidated stock, so that the full amount of capital was shown in the accounts. (Hear, hear.)
Major COURT said the explanation was not satisfactory to him.
The CmkIR3!A.s hoped that the hon. proprietor would come some day to the office, where he could Bee the accounts and have them explained to him.
On the motlon of Mr. Norris, the retiring directors, Viscount Barrington, the Right Hon. Spencer Walpole, and Mr. Ogleby, were unanimouslyre-elected directors; and Mr. Luce, hLP., was elected a director in the room of Lord Bateman, resigned.
Some observations having been made with respect to the recommendations of the committee for altering the management,
The CAnuRsa? said he hoped they would let the existing system of management have a fair trial, and if the directors found that the other system would be better it would be altered to that, if they considered that it would be for the benefit of the company. Having said so much it was usual for directors to say something on their re-election, and he could assure them that as long as he had the honour to sit at the board he would continue to work and to fag for the benefit of the company. (Cheers.)
Mr. MsALInS brought forward his proposition in regard to the coal trade. He stated that the consumption of coal in London was from 4,000,000 to 5,000,(,00 tons, and that only 11,000 tons had been conveyed by the Great Western Railway in 1856. He trusted that the board would consider whether it was not possible to give such encouragement to the coal trade on the line as would bring a greater coal traffic than on any other metropolitan line. He considered the break of gauge fatal to the coal traffic, and believed that if 35 miles of additional line were laid down on the narrow gauge they would save its cost in obviating the necessity of
transhi ets,
Mr. '%zILLLUIS, a director, said it was his duty to correct some very disparaging statements respecting the coal traffic
thathad been made on Friday last, and regretted they should have remained so long before the public uncontra-
icted. He then explained that the Ruabon coalfield had been purchased by Mdr. Gooch and others, with the approval of Mr. Walpole's committee, and afterwards the matter was submitted to the shareholders aboat 1-2 months ago, and received their sanction. The matter was done with a view to benefit the Great Western Company, and to increase the coal traffic. The great object was to obtain good coal suited for domestic purposes, and that was secured in the Ruabon distridt. In the arrangement with the Ruabon Coal Company, at the head of which was Mr. Gooch, every care had ben taken to secure the interests of the Great Western Company, and to prevent any clashing of intorests between the company and their zervants. It was found that the company could not become coalowners, and, with a view to form a coal company friendly to their interests, their servants took the matterup, and the companywas formed under theprovisions of the Linited Liability Act. The consideration of that agreement had taken many months to frame, and at last it was signed. The terms of it might be said to be stereotyped, as they formed the basis of all other agreements for carrying the coal traffic on the Great Western lines. The distance they had to bring the coals rwas L200 miles; it was therefore necessary to fix the rate as low as possible, to take a large quantity in every train, and to have a regular supply, the engines always to travel with full loads. For shorter distances the charges were higher in proportion. The same agreement was opren to all other companies-the Somersotshire, South Wales, Forest of Dean, and other coalfields. The l.uabon coal did not compete with any of them. The South Wales people had sent a great deal of steam coal to London in 1853 and 1856L They did not send coals for domestic purposes, thereforo there was no competition, as the Ituabon coal was unfit for steam purposes. The statements with regard to the Ruabon Coal Company compoting with the Somerset, Forest of Dean, and other collieries were untrue. The western collieries of Somerset and Radstock confined their supply to Bath and Bristol by road, and by the Avon Canal as far as Reading, but they sent none by the Great Western Railway. he Forest of Dean coal found its way up to Swindon. The business of the directors was to encourage a traffic that would increase their dividends. He then read portions of Mr. Neweombe's report with respect to the allegations in the coalowners' memorial, from which it appeared
at not one of thaegatonswas sustained. Mr. Gooch badnottheconrolover the engines, waggons, and trucks, and with regard to coalowners having free passes there were onl tw caes henthe coal comipany was established 12 motsago, and that was only once up and clown. 'With regard to the stationery 1 sed at the stations, the cost of it was charged to the coal company, the labour at the stations was charged to the coal company, demurrage of truck-s, and, in fact, every item. The same facilities would be afforded to ary other company or person. As to the ld. per ton for transhipment at Wolverhampton, that more than covered the expense. The railway company lost nothing by the coal company in anitem, buit they got more from them than
from anyone eUe in the trade. If the vmonaists womald enter into the same terms witt. theGreat WesternCompany they should have the same privileges. There was no ground whatever for the allegation afainst Mr. Gooch as to the probability of his interference with the working stock, because he had no power to do so. He was a moat valuable servant to the company, and they whad no ish to part with [hIim.There was lsto bn allegaUto cting the exclusive uase of the new branch lines by the vasbon Company, which was totally unfounded. (O0heers.)
Mr. HOYES strongly objected to the principle of allowing their servants to be engaged in any other busiess than that; of the company, He would pay thema well, hut claim the whole of their time and serviees for the ay. H di
nxot object to free pusseson business cou witX~h te didpany, or to establish a coal traffic, but he 4id Object to the company's tervanits being interested in thiat traffic.
After acmie observations from Air. NLCHOLSON M3r. ROBINqSON, and other gentlemen interested isi tho coal trade,
M1r. MbiLs remark-ed that the discussion would dos gr&eat deal of good, and if the directors would receive aL deputatiDn from the memorialists and hear what they had to say 6,,
oT1wulht they ought to be wellatif~ WIN e ile, 0'ppose4
the directors on that and other points ; but he had eveq confidence in their honour and integri}y. He bad no wisa to go on harassing the board, and he trusted they would do the best they could for the company. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. SAVNDnMS wished to makea feew a remarks with respect to the coal question. Ho hal been desired by the noble lord in the chair to give then some information on the subject, but, before doing so, he hoped they would allow him to say a few words respectingaperaonal matter. During the last 12 montha he had felt that considerable injustice had been done him in reference to the position he heldL It. had been stated that he had assumed a power which was inconsistent with his position as a servant of the company. He would appeal to the gentlemen at the board whether he deserved such an imputation upon his character. (Loud cheers.) He ha striven to do his duty to tho utmost of his power; he found they had not attempted to throw the slightest imputation on his character or integrity. (HWear.) He could not continue to go through another year if he was to exist under such imputations. It might be that an old servant might be inconvenient-an nld and faithful servant might stand in the way of other gentlemen. ("-No! no !") He would not consent to anything that would degrade his position. Ee had no tenacity for offlce, and would not allow himself to be degraded by any one holding a superior
positon over him. He would conform to the decision of the corde believed that lr. Withers wouldremember that the first thing the Committee of Consultation, of which he was a member in 1849, did, was to deprive him of the services of an assistant-secretary, and, although heavily taxed, he (Mr. Saunders) worked on, but he could tell them, if he remained in the post he held, he must have more assistance. (Cheers.) Wit regard to the coal trade great misapprehension existed. If they were to make the line pay they must get all the coal traffic they could upon it, provided they could make it remunerative. A long distance was advantageous for conveyingthe traffic-the conveyance for50 miles would cost more in proportion than 100 or 150 miles. The position of the GreatWesternlines was favourable foralarge coal traffic-steam coals from South Wales. Those from the Forest of Dean had been sent only in small quantities, aud from those they derived very little advantage. The Somerset coals were carried for short distances only, and yielded very little. The price of the coals at the pit was too t high, and the Forest of Dean kept up their prices also, having no regard to an increase of traffic. He would tell them what had been done in the coal traffic on the Great Western proper during the past three half. years. They had 149,50( tons in the last half of 1855, and 176,000 tons in the last half of 1856, showing an increase. The increase in the Ruabon was from 11,000 to 27,000 tons. They had 210,000 tons from South Wales and the Forest of Dean, which paid them on the average 4s. per ton, or 42,0001. The Somnerset coals for three half-years were 140,000 tons, at 3s. 6d. per ton. The steaTn coal, at 5s. 4d. per ton, yielded 13,900t. ; and the North Wales coal, 51,000 tons, at &. ld. per ton, yielded them 21,000t.; that would show the value of that district to them. He then showed the difficulty they had to introduce coals into Bath, where 80,000 tons a-year were consumed. Until they took some cheap coals there the Forest of Dean never sent any. Tbe carriage of the North Wales coals yielded them 8s. 4d. per ton; the Somersetihire, 3s. 6d. per ton; the Vale of Neath 5s. ld. per ton; and the South Wales and Forest of Dean, 4s. per ton. There would be no difficulty in sepaating the items, so as to show what the coal paid them. So long as the price of coal was kept up to 11s. and 12s. at the Forest of Dean the traffic could not increase, that price went into the coalowners pockets He hoped they would lower their prices, and send what they could over the line. He then pointed out the inaccuracies in Mr. Talbot's letter respecting the South Wales coal traffic, and showed that it was not the fault of the Great Western that the coal traffic of South Wales had not increased. He (Mr. Saunders) had himself urged on the South Wales Company the necessity of comimg to arrangements for the conveyance of coals at a low rate, and to agree with the coalowners of SouthWales for large quantities f or a term of years. hlr. Talbot had wiritten a letter to him on the 14th of March, 1856, on the subject, in which he specified that the rates should be dd. per ton per mile, and that MIr. Cubitt's award shorold be relaxed wstth regard to that trade. He had laid the letter before the directors, and they immediately agreed to the terms, so there was no blame to them for the South Wales coal traffic not being developed; but thoy never could get the South WVales Company to come to an agreement with them; they could never get Mr. Talbot to agree to the arrangement, although be complained in his letter. At every meeting of the South Wales Company Mr.Talbot had declaimed againsttheGreatWesternComnany as charging them too much under the award of MIr. Cuabitt. The first arrangement for working the South Wales traffic was at cost price, but Mr. Talbot objected to that, and demanded a fixed rate per mile; the mat' - was referred to arbitration, and the result was higher than Mr. Talbot anticipated. He never stated that the Great Western had contributed between 50,0004 and 60,0001. under the lease to the net profits of the South Wales Company, although he did not forget to allude to the small benefit they derived from the mileage rate in providing locomotive power, &c. He had not told them that the Great Western had paid the South Wales from 5,0001. to 10,0001 a-year, which was a clear gain to them and a loss to the Great Western Company. He believed that loss was now on the turning point. (Cheers.)
Mr. WILLwIs said he was a director of the Shrewsbury lines, and therefore could speak without favour or affection as to the duties of the secretary. He could state no man could keep more strictly vrithin the hounds of the duties of secretary than Mr. Saunders had done. He had always found him ready to promote the interests of the company. (Hear.)
Mr. SAU7NDERSs saw no reason why the coal traffic on the Great Western should not be as large as on any line similarly eituated. If they wonld only have confidence in the board, and say they wished the coal traffic extended, they would do everything in their power to carry it out. The Great Western had peculiar advantages for carrying on a large coal traffic; the gradients, the power of their engines, and the economy of working were all in their favour. Until the line from Bull's-bridge to the Thames at Brent. ford was opened they could not develope the South Wales steam coal traffic. If the South Wales would put their shoulders to the wheel they would have a very large traffic, and other places would do likewise. He believed the coal trade, by means of well regulated rates, would yield in the course of three or four years, independent of other traffic, an increase of 1, 11, to 21 per cent. on their I ordinary dividend.
I r. MALINS perfectly agreed in the observations of Mr. Saunders, and withdrew his motion for the appointment of a committee,
Resolutions were passed authorizing the directors to enter into arrangements for working the Abingdon, Bridport, Devizes, and other lines, and to promote a bill in Parliament for a modification of the Cornwall agreement, with a view to facilitate the completion of the line.
Mr. MILES, seconded by Mr. WITvIIES, moved, in complimentary terms, a vote of thanks to the chairman for the very kind manner in which he had conducted the proceedings. (Cheers.)-The meeting then separated.

POLICMs.
XANXSIoN-uouLD-Frederick Kimpen was charged befora the LORD 3AYo.R with having stolen a coat in the Wine Shades on London-bridge.
Jobn Parker, waiter to Mr. Benjamin Poole, who kee
the house, said,-About 3 o'clockon the 14th of Febrnarythe prisoner came m and called for a glass of sherry, and pid ForitHe satdown, aLndIwentdownstairsto servea gentleman who hadjust come in, when the prisonerleft the room- and as he passed through the lobby he took a coat which belonged to MIr. k'ooleoff anail, andput iton his arm. Hehad -littledifficulty in getting it off from the nail, on which hung another coat which it was more hard to remove, or he would have had both. Hfe walked deliberately into the street with the coat, and I followed him, and caught him by the collar in Thames-street with the coat on his arm. He asked me what
odo, and I replied, to gve him in charge. He Dottodo so, and asid he would give me any money to let him go; and he resisted very much.
Policeman (5861.-I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him. I found on him a letter which contained a sovereign and a-half, a chain, and a book.
The prisoner, who is a German, said, through an interpreter,-l am above the commission of such an offence. The coat was lying on the ground by the door, and I took it up and threv it on a kind of banister that goes down into the cellar, and then the waiter came and collared me and said I intended to steal the coat.
The prisoner asked the witnesses several questions, but theiranswers confirmed in everyrerpect the statements they had made.
There were, the prisoner said, several gentlemen in the court who knew him to be incapable of any act of dishonesty.
The LORD MiYOR stated that the only way in which he could treat such a case was to send it to the Central Criminal Court.
The prisoner was then committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
The LORD 3MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of the foUowing sums for the poor box -51., being a consideration agreed to between two persons to settle a dispute and to avoid litigation on a matter of business; and"E.O.,"1l. HisLoRwSm Psaid,withrespect to the first contribution, that he very rauch admired the kind feeling by which both persons were animated, and that he hoped such an example of good taste as well as charity would be often followed.
GUILDHALL-The sitting Magistrate has received 36 coal-tickets from "I. H.," which will be distributed as requested.
MARLBonouOUn-sTiwr.-3ar. Lloyd has sent 12.. and "J. C." 10s., for Shayles, who rescued three children from a house in flames.
MARYLRBONL.-Mr. BROSJORToN was engaged for some time in an investigation in reference to the case of the widow AlLsop, who, as alleged by her, had lost five sons in the service of their Queen and country-three of them at Cabul, and two in the Crimea.
The widow, who had been ordered to attend, was present at 2 o'clock. Soon after that hour bhe was called in, and was seatednear the attorneys' table. Sho was dressed in halfmourning, and seemed to be somewhat beyond 60 years of age.
Mr. BRorGsrToN.-I have sent for you to be here to-day, m AUsop, for the purpose of putting some questions to you which I consider it my duty to do in consequence of a great deal of money having been forwarded to me since the publication of your case in the papers. It is now necessary that there should be a clear understanding in the affair before you have any money handed over to you.
Mr AUlsop.-WiU you allow me, Sir, to speak to you privately, for there are many letters that -
Mr. BROGOHTON.-No, you cannot have an interview with me in private. The inquiry must be in open court. Now, answer my questions. Are you a widow?9
Mrs. AUlsop.-I am, Sir.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-IIn what regiment was your husband
Mrs. AUlsop.-Iu the 44th Eegiment for a long time in India, and be exchanged into another regiment. We then came to E:ngland, my husband selling off the half-ay awarded to him, and he received for it 1,4001. I had after his death a little income.
Mr. BnOuGuToON.-From what source was your income derived ?
Mrs. Ailsop.-Don't ask me, Sir, for the sake of those who are dead.
Mr. BBOUGI1TON.-Now, be careful as to whatI am asking you. Had you any sons at Cabul?
MTS. Allsop.-I had three there; they were born while my husband was in the 44th Regiment;* two of them, who were twins, were christened one in the name of James, and the
Mr. BROUGHTON.-In what way did they meet their death ?
Mrs. Allsop.-They were blown up into the air. Nearly the whole of the regiment was kiUed.
Mr. BRoUGrTTON.-Did you receive any intimation from the War-office that your sons had been destroyed at Cabul ?
Mrs. Allsop.-Yes.
Mr. BsOuGHToN.-Have you received any pay that might have been due to them?
Mrrs. A.sop.-No, Sir.
Mrs. Allsop here turned over a number of papers, some of which were handed to the magistrate.
Mtr. BnOucsToN.-When did you first send in a petition ?
Mlrs. Allsop.- In 1848 ; that was to the Queen, and I did not send to Prince Albert until after the Queen denied me.
Mr. BROUGBTON.-When you petitioned the Queen why did not you mention about your sons, who, as you allege, were killed at Cabul ?
Mrs. Allsop (after some heaitation).-I did, to the best of my belief, state it.
Mr. BRouanTor.-I have a well-authenticated letter that you did not do anything of the sort in your petition to Eer ajesty. Can you bring forward any witnesses who kInew that you had sons in the army, and who were killed ?
Mrs. Allsop.-Mrs. Douglas, living in Nutfort-place, knows it.
Mr. BROUGETON.-Is she here ? Mrs. Allsop.-No, Sir.
Mr. BrouGnToN.-Are you aware that when applications have been made at the Horse Guards none of the names of either of your sons were found entered there?
Mrs. AsOp.-Yes; but, although I could not get justice where I had a right, as I thought, to look for it, I still met with a friend.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Who was he?
Mrs. Alsop.-Lord Fitzroy Somerset. Don't ask me any more questions about it.
lfr. BROIUGMO.-Can you refer me to any one who ever saw either of your sons, knowing them to be in the army ?
3.Ms. Allsop.-I cannot now, Sir; but I might be able to do soupon another day.
Mlr. BROUGTON.-In 1855 the greatest excitement pro. vailedin regard to the Crimean war. Will you teU me why you never made mention about your sons in the petition which in that year you say you sent in ?
Mrs Allsop.-I did make mention of it.
Mr. BRouoGnTox-Now, I have the petition here (the magistrato produced it and read it), in which you make no allusion at aU to any sons in the Crimea. Have you ever applied to the parish ?
Mrs. Alsop.-I have, Sir; and have been in the receipt of 3s. 6d. per week, but it is now stopped.
Mr. BROuGonox.-Before that allowance was made to you, you wereo no doubt, questioned with regard to your circumstances by the proper authorities of Marylebone ?
Mtrs. AlIsop.-Yes; I was examined by them.
Mr. BRouoHTOx.-And did you not tell them you had three sons only and two daughters?
Mrs. Allsop.-They did not ask me any of those questions. Lord Raglan was a kind friend to me, and assisted me.
AMr. BRounLrToN.-Have you any letter stating that Lord Raglan ever afforded you aid?
Mrs. Alisop.-I have it not here, Sir, but it can be produced some othertime-perhaps I have it now. (She re looked over a large packet of papers, but could not find it.) But, why am I put to all this pain and exposure in court, when Mr. Jenmer, of Doctors'-commons, could, if he liked to come forward, explain at once all about my interest in my late husband's property ?
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Do you remember any inquiries being made respecting you by the Mendicity Society?
Mrs. Allsop.-Yes; they have injured me. They get a great deal of money from the public, and the poor people who ought to have it get little or notbing.
(It had been ascertained that Mrs. AlIsop has been well known as a begging letterwriter forsome tme)
Mr. BROUGIION (a letter having been handed to him by Mr. Franklin).-Were you ever at Bradford?
Mrs. Allsop.-Brentord, did you say ? I don't know the place.
Mr. BnOuGoTOi.-Bradford, and not Brentford, was mentioned. Do you know that town ?
Mfrs. Allsop.-Certiny not. I am an ill-used woman and havo put my case in the hands of a lawyer, who w lay everything fully before tho public at large.
After some further questions to Mrs. .Asop the 3tagistrate, addressing her, said-It is now unnecessary for me to keep up this inquiry any longer. I did at first entertain a favourable opinion of you, but my impression has since been altered. I believe that your story with regard to your five sons having lost their lives in the service of their country is a fable. L it be not so, it isa most extraordinary thing that clergymen and others whose names you have made use
of in various ways, and who, as stated by you, have known you for a long while, know nothing respecting your children, the young men who you state have perished in battle. You told the guardians and directors of the Door that you had three sons and two daughters only, and the letter which I havo by me, addressed byyou to ColonelPhipps, is dated March, 1850. When I received it from you it bore the date 1856. The Prince caused inquiries to be made. and they turned out to be unfavourable-hence arose the letter doclining assistance to the widow. I (added Mr. BROUGirrON) have also made the most diligent inqiuiries, and they are equally unfavotsable as regards your claim for assistance. Ater a carefnl invostigation I come to no other conclusion than that you (mrs. A.Usop) had no sons killed either at Cabal or in the Crimea, and that your story in your applications to Boyalty was not founded in fact. I am anxious that it should go forth, and more particularly in Tlte rTe that, feeling as I do upon the matter, the persons who have contributed sums for the wido under as belief that she was a deserving object may have them returned in the event of Mrs. Alsop not being able in the course of a few days to establish a proper claim to public sympathy and aid. Should the donors not be desirous of having back their contributions, I shall devote them to the poorbox, from which many deserving and distressed persons will derive assistance.
Mrs. Alsop then left the co.irt, saying, IT'll havc the whole of my case put into all the papers."
WORSHP-STEET.-John Walker, a haberdasher in Sbaftesbury-street, New North-road, was brought up for re-examination upon a charge. preferred by the parish authorities of Shoreditch, of neglecting, ill-feeaing, and cmelly using his orphan niece, eight years of age ; ad a bey named Carles Gleed was charged wit wilfully smash. lug the other defendant's windows.

CLERK12NWELL.A Ilarge body of unemployed artisans. and labourers who had formed part of a meeting in a field, near Agar-town, St. Pancras, marched up in front of the. court, headed by the chairman of the meeting, who acted as spokesman. He stated to Mr. COmBE that they had applied to St. Pancras parish for relief, and having beenrefusedthey came peaceably to seek advice and assistance from his worship. The poor persons who now attended were starving with their families and had not tasted food 'all day. Numbers of the persons present confirmed this fact, and Mr.
Co;sBs humanely ordered that bread should be procured, and distributed to them, and the station-house yard next tothe court was immediately crowded by the hungry multi-- tude. Mr. Bayliss, the chief usher of the court, ordered, an immense quantity of loaves of various bakers in thonaighbourhecd, and they were handed over bv Mr. Superintendant Martin, of the G division, and other of ficers in. quantities according to the distress and wants of the recipients.
TH%mss-Two strong and ablebodied fellows, of raf. fianly *pparance aud manners, named Joseph Lee, aged 19, of o. 33, Devonshire-street, Commercial-road-east, and. James Sadlier, of No. 12, Star-street, Commercial-roadeast, plumber, 22, were charged with seizing John Duihm, of No. 6, Lower Pelham-street, Spitalfields, by the neck, throwing him backwards, and attempting to rob him of his watch and money.
The prosecuitor said,-I was returning home about 2 o'clock this morning, and while passing along Hith-street, Whitechapol, I saw the two prisoners with another man and a woman. Sadlier came up to me and said " What have you been insulting my girl for 2' I replied, "I have not seen her or you before." Upon which Lee seized me by the throat and nearly strangled me. He threw me down and held me fast while Sadlier, who acted in a most violent manner, tore my waistcoat open, and put his hand in one of my pockets, but there was nothing in that pocket. He then made a snatch at my watchguard. By a desperate effort I partially released myself, and got upon my feet, and was enabled to call " Police l" The policemen came up, and the two ruffians threw me on the ground and ran away. But for the policemen iarriving as they did I should certainly have been robbed of al I had. They strackme twice, and hurt me very much.
Mr. YARDLEY.-Are you sure those are the men who attacked you?
Mr. Duhm.-I am, Sir; I can positively swear to them.
Margaret English, a young woman, said,-I was passing and saw the pnsoners together, and one of them caught the prosecutor by the throat and threw him down. Therewere three of them, but one ran away, and got clear from the police.
Police-constable Woodward, No. 187 H, statedthat he saw Mr. Duhm in the hands of the prisoners, and on running to the spot the men run away. He foUowed Sadlier and overtook him close to the Red Lion and Spread Eagle publichouse on the north side of the High-street. On apprehending him he said he had just come out of tha public-
ouse. He took the prisoner to the prosecutor, who at once said, "He is one of the men who attempted to rob me."
Police-constable Burgess, No. 190 H, said he also heardk the prosecutor crying "Police, police l and pursued Lee and succeeded in apprehending him.
Police-sergeant Foay, No. 7 H, said he knew both prisoners well as the associates of thieves. Lee had been in custody, and was once summarily convicted at the Worship. street court.
Lee pleaded "Guilty." The other prisoner said nothing. Mr. YARDLEY said he was not going to dispose of this case summarily, and commitied the prisoners for trial.
LmSBETH.-George Collins, a smart young fellow, who gave his address 54, ;ueen-street, Palace-road, Birmingham,. was charged with the following attempt at highway robbery and violence:-
Mr. William Harvey. of 19, New-street, Kenningtonroad, traveUer, said-About 12 o'clock last night I was passing along the Kennington-road and overtook and passed the prisoner. Immediately after I had done so I received a severe blow on the back of the head, and on turning round I saw the prisoner, who said " he would have my money; that he had none, and would have mine." He then Put hig hand into his pocket, and took out something which I tbought was a knife. To avoid him I ran into the road, when I was folloWed by the prisoner; and at this moment Mr. Moss, a gentleman who is now present, fortunately came up. I told him what the prisoner had done to me, and he endeavoured to secure him, wshen a policeman came up, and took him into custody.
Mr. Joseph Moss, a clerk in the War-office, residing at No. 6, New-street, Kenninglon, deposed that he saw the prisoner chasing the prosecutor, and t7he latter asked him to assist him. He did so, and pushed the prisoner back while hewasstrikingatthe prosecutor. The prisoner said he would have the prosecutor's money or his life, and was very violent indeed.
Ir. ELLIOTT.-Are you sure the prisoner made use of those expressions?
Mr. Moss.-Quite sure, and he was very violent when he said so.
Police-constable Joseph Kneck, 115 P, said,-Last night, while on duty in the hennington-road, I heard a scuffling noise at some distance off, and on going to the spot the prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Harvey, who told me wisat he had done. I asked him how he came to attaek the gentleman, and he replied, " rll have his money or his life." I then took him to the station, and from what was told me then b the rosecutor I went back to the spot where the assa had en ommitted, and there found this knife.
Cook, the gaoler, recognized the Prisoner as an old customer, and the prisoner himself acknowledged to having been committed fron this court for two months on a charge of picking pockets; but Cook was of opinion that that was not his only visit.
The prisoner, who offered nothing in defence, was fully committed for trial.
The magistrate requested the acknowledgment of the first half of a 5U.-note, the annual subscription of the benevolent "Peter Pickwick ;" and lOs. in postage stamps from "E. C. W.," for the poorbox.
PAUPER CHILDREN.-From a return moved for
PxUPE, CH TnEm,.-From a return moved for
by Mr. M. Gibsont M I , it appears that on the 1st of July, I, there rwere atogether 58,243 children in England anc
Wales attending dayschsools at tho cost of parents or relatives; 3,986 attending dayschools at the cost of the poor-

S}HOCKrN Suxcwn BY STBRYCH E.-A painfU1 sensation was created in Newvport last week by the reporb of the death of Mr. William Gummow from strychnine, administered by his oW1 hands; and the fatal act is of importance to the world oD account of the distressing symptoms. which exhibited themselves for some fiTe houxs previoual
to his death. On proceeding to view the body the coroner.s ury found deceased in the same position, in bed, in which te died, and he presented a most fearful sight. His eyeballs seemed ready to burst from their sockets; his teeth were tightly closed; the features drawn and contracted, and the whole countenance frightfully distorted, his fists, too, were firmly clinched; his feet forced out beyond the foot of the bed, and his limbs in a state of fixed rigidity. The poison was bought by the servant of the suicide. The druggist recollected the latter coming to his shop and asking for arsenic to cill rats. He gave him three grains of strvchnine. " I have sold the same (said the druggist) for killing rats for four or five years to many persons. I write theword 'poison' onmypackages, and have not aprinted label" The coronerand jury observed it would be muchbetter to have a printedlabeL The deceased took the whole three grains. The doctor who attended him first tried strong emetics, which produced no effect. He then applied the stomach-pump, but his mouth was so firmly fixed, and the spasms and violent paroxysmrn were so powerful as to shake the gslaimps in the room belowv, and he could not in any way apply it, His body was bent in a curved form as in lock-jaw. they were onl; such symptoms as would be produced by strychnine or hydrophobia, The spasms contracted and bent the feet, "id the hands were clinched too, and he died in one of sWote convulsions, quite black in the face. From half a&n holtr to twohours is the longest time known in such cases after spasms. have commenced. Half a grain is enough to destroy life
The right side of the heart was found full of blood, and the, left empty. It has been a disputed point (in the cases; lately before the public) as to whether this side should bo fuUl or empty in cases of poisoning by strychnine, but thet,e havoe been instances both ways. The lungs were blacker thuan susl, but the other organs healthy,-Hcntz Adivf-

The late owners have expended upon the works upwards of £16,000 in sinking four pita or shafts, erecting buildings,machinery. a The shafts and buildings are Judici'nsly plaoed, and can be made available to the exhaustion of the cowal oeld The weli-known increasing demand for Foreot coal, with the diminishing s&&ly. and the proximity of the East Slade and Newham Bottom Co 'ery to the Glocester and Hereford and South Wales Rallwayl, renders this property of great and increasing value. The late owners suspended the works of this colliery tolely from want of tramway oominuhicatio with the railways, A tramroad connecting the contigooas colleries has now been laid down, passing the month of th EBast Slade pit, and jonuing the main lines as above, thereby bringing this valuable colliery into direct communication with the best markets of the kidn. dom, at a very moderate expense. A legitimate opportunity is afforded for the establishment of a company with limited responsibilty, to purchase and work this colliery. It is subJect only to a rent to the Crowrn of 2d. per ton for all coal raised, Particulars and plans may be obtained of Messrs. Bubb, soltcitors, Cheltenham; at ths Auction Mart, LIndon;. of C.
