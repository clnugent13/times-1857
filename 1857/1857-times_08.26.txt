PROMOTION IN THE ARMY. lord PANLURE said, I tke this opportunity, before yourlordships adjourn forttho reooess, to proment the report of the oommission appointed by ier Majesty to inquire into the salo and purchaee of oommissions in the army. The report has already boon preosnted to the other House of Parliament, and It is on account of the evidence given before the commisbion that I am anxious that evidence should bO in the hands of your lordships during the recees. I shall oarefully abstain from making any remarks on theroport, whioh I shall now lay before your lordships, but there aro some facts with regard to it which I think it right your lordships should know. Ten members were originally appointed under the commisidon. This report is signed by nix members, inoluding my noble friend the Duke of Somerset, the chairman of the conmission; but one of tho six, Sir D. L. Evans, entered a protest at the end of the report, and lntimated his intention to send through the chairman of the commiwsIon a separate document stating his own opinion. Four other members of the commisson have refused to sign the repo as they differ from the opinions which it oontams, and Mr. Ellice, one of those commissioners, has intimated to me officially that it Is his intention to send in a Eeparate report in his own name, and aiso in the names of Sir H. Bentin¢k and General Wynyard, which will reaoh me during the recess, and which I shall be prepared to lay upon the table atthecommenoementof next session. I may add further, thattheotheroommisaioner-Oolonel Wetherall -before the evidence was entirely complete, entered into active service in China, and is in China at present, dischbaging military duties. I shall have an opportunity of communicating with him before Parliament meetagain, and I dare say I shall be able then to announce his opinion with regard to (this very important subject. I thought it necessary to make these remarks, because it is quite clear that as the report is signed by only one-half of the commissioners, it ought not to go forth to the country as a report nnously agreed to by the whole of the commission. (Hear.) The noble lord taen laid the report on the table. THE STATE OF THE LIFFEY. Lord ST. LEONARD'S directed attention to the state of the river Liffey, at Dablin. The whole bottom of the river was fled with sewage, and the pestilential effiuvia caused thereby must be very injurious to the health of the City. lord PANM13E said it was deeply to be regretted that not only ia Dablin but in London those streams which Providence seemed to have plaed for the purpose of giving Eanitary advantages should become offensive and unwholesome to the iuhabitants of those cities. IH would draw the attention of the Lord-Lieatenant to the subject, adhe was quite certain no one couldbe more disposaed to attendtosuch a matter as involved sanatory improvement than his noble friend at the head of the Government of Ireland. (Hear.) rLord ST. LEONARD'S wished just to add, that in Dublin the quays were already formed, and the sewage might more easily be cut off from the river there than here. (Hear.) The subject was not further pursued. At 3 o'clock theii lordships adjourned during pleasure. The LORD CHAcELLOR rumed his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. The CI.xn of the PAinLsAus (Mr. J. S. Lefevre) read a message from the Commonsin the following terms:" The Commons agree to the amendments made by the Lords to the amendments made by the Commons to the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, but propose a consequential amendment in clause E, and do not insist in the amendment to which the Lords have disagreed." The LORD CHANCELLOR observed that the amendment referred to ia the messge as disagreed to by their lordships was the insertion of the words givmg jurisdiction to the Court of quarter sessions, which their lordships had struck out, and moved that their lordships do agree to the Commons' amendment. The motion was agreed to; and On the motion of LoRD PAN,uRE the House adjourned at a quarter past 5 o'clock until Friday.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, TuzsDAY, AuGUST 25. The SPXEA:B took the char at 2 o'clock. Err. IL BERKELEY presented a petition from Mr. Wilkes, bookseller, of Parliament-street, oomplaining of waste in the Gover,mnent Stationery-office, and praying for Inquiry. MIr. Pu=rt Deputy-lJsher of the Black Rod, appeared at the bar, and summ oned the Htoue to attend in the House of Lords to hear the Royal assent given by commisson to several Bills, for the titles of which see Lords' report. THEE BEVEiR,EiY ELECTION. Upon the return of the SrnaExim, Mr. CRAUFURD asked whether the Attorney-General bad yet considered the evidence reported by the Committee on the Beverley Election Petition, and ordered to be laid befere him bv the unanimous resolution of that committee, and whether it was his intention to take any proceedings thereon ? The SOLICITOR-GETERAL replied that the AttorneyGeneral had not yet been able to come to a decision upon the matter referred to, which was still under the consideration of the law officers of the Crown. GERAiAN LEGIONARIES AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. Mr. ADDERLEY wished to put a question to the Colonial Secretary with reference to the immense collection of troops in British pay at the Cape of Good Hope, and, in order that he might be able to make a short explanatory statement, he would put himself right with the House by conoluding with the motion that the House do now adjourn, He wished to know whether, from the answer given yesterday to a question put by a gallant officer, they were to understand that the whole body of German Legionaries who had been sent to the Cape were now, and had been ever since their arrival there, in fill pay at the expense of the British Treasury. The agreement made with the Government of the Cape, as he urnderstood it, was that these German Legionaries were not to be put on ful pay except in a Case of great emergency. Now, they had been informed that the colony was never In a more peaceful state than at the present momnpt. He therefore wishod to know for what reason those troops had been put on fau pay, and under what arramngements for the future that course bad been adopted? When this country was stripped of its natural and necessary defenders, it was right the House should know why there were no fewer than 15 regiments at the Cape, and also why we should be paying 201. a-head to the German Legionarles there, while those of the legion who were not disposed of by being sent to the Cape were got rid of at 2Z. a.head? Sir G. Cathcart said three regiments were quite suffilient to preserve order in that colony, and that if It were put in a proper state of defence even they might be dispensed with in three years. On what pretoet, then, was 5o large a force kept there? They were told that orders had been sent to-the Governor at the Cape to despatch two regiments to India, but they had not yet heard that they had been sent. The very least force tbat the Governor should send to India was six regiments. (Hear hear.) No doubt the Governor had got plans and schemes which were very ingenions, though ho had tried them elsewhere, as in New Zealand, where they had proved entire failures. He thought to deal with the Caffre tribes as no other governor had done before ; and there was this palpable inconsistency about his plan-that at one and the same moment he askced 40,000Q for the eivilization of thoss tribes and 200,0001. as the cost of soldiers to keep themin awe. Yesterday the right hon. gentleman stated that bhe presence of the Germau legionarles would liberate other troops atthe iCape for servicein India. Perhaps in answering the question which he bad put the right hon. gentle. man would state how many troops would be so liberated. (Rear, hear.) The hon. gentlemaan condaded by moving that the House do now adjourn. 3Mr. LABOQUHERE did not complain of the hon. gentleman putting the questions which he nowc did, but he regretted tha; he should have taken the opportunity to go into other, subjects not necessarily connected with them, and that he should have reiterated statements formerly made by bi4 as to the general policy of Sir G. Grey. (Hear, hear.) He would not enter into that question further than to say that he believed the poihoy of Sir G. t:rey with reterene to the native tribes would be as successful as it bad 'een politic and energetic. ((ear, hear.) The reason why the German Legionaries were called out and embodied at the Cape was twofold. It was partly thouZht advIsble, with reference to their discipline anl organization, to keep them at first in an embodied state; and itwas patly done for milm- tary reasons, In order to make them useful as soldiers serving at the Cape, for it would be observed that the Caffres were not then so peaceable as they had become siao. (Hear.) As he had stated on a former occasion, their preBence would enable the Governor to increase the xeinforcemnents sent to India. The hon. gentleman seemed to think that the Governor of the colony would not do his duty in that respect, and would retain at the Cape more troops thsa were in reality wanted; but he (Mr. labouchere) entertained no such apprehendons. He had no doubt that Si: G. Gxey would obey the instractions conveyed to him, and that he would send to India as large a force as he oould Fpar consistently with the preservation of the peace and tranquillity of the Cape. (Hear, hear.) The first orders were that he was to send two regiments to India. Since that we had been masd aware that the Governor of Bombay had applied to Sir G. Grey for reinforcements, bat the answer to that applieauon had not yet transpired. He bad no doubt, however. that he would,, to the utmost of his po*er, comply with the request,widi had been made to him. It was a fortanate thtng that we hal so large a number of troops eollected at the Cape, and that there was at the moment no danger to that oolony from the inroads of the Cafires (Hear.) The collection of these troop§ at the tape would enable the Governor to send valuable reinforcementg to India, and he should be very much disappointed if Sir G. Grey did not do ali his power to asist tho Indian Government in this emergency. He had lately been told by a very high military authority that one regiment sent to India fter serv3ng at the Cape was of more value there than two regiments sent cut under ordinary circumstaness from this country. Sir D. L. EVANS asked why it was that the embodimnent of these German troops had not been made known to the House before? It appeared that they had boen embodied some time, but It wa only yesterday that Parliament was made acquamted with the fact. Mr. L .BOUCEiERE said that when first the Informg. tion reached this country it was not very complete, and it Iwas necessary before laying it before Parliament to have fuller details. Major WORTLYZ said that sme little time ago, when he asked wby the 45th, 91st, and 73d giment had been kept at thne Capeso much longer than the usual term of colonial service, he wras told by the noble lord at the head of the Government that it wras absolutely Impossible in the present condition of the colony that those regiments could be spared, but now it appeared that Sir G Grey had informed the Government that the tranqui state of the colony permitted him to send away ample reinforcements to India. H[e hoped that the Governorwould be instructed to end to India the three regiments which he had named whose long oolonias service entitled them to that boon. Sir G. GREY said that it rested with the Commander-inChief, and not with the Government, to designate the regiments to be sent. Mr. ADDERLEY asked how many regiments the Government of Bombay had asked for from ths Cape ? Mr. LABO'UCHERE said the Bombay Government had asked for t wo regiments, and he believed a large number of horses would be sent from the Cape. Sir D. L. EVANS asked whether the expediency of adding to the Comnpany'sEurouean regiments had beentaken into condderation ? Mr. V. SMITH said that this point had been conderead, but at present it was not thought desirable to add to the European regimeents of the East Ind.& Company. The motion for adjournment was then withdrawn. ARMY CHAPLkINS. On the motion of Sir D. L. EvA-s (in the absence of Colonel North), a nominal return was ordered of the chaplains attached to the army in the Crimea, -.ith the dates of their appointments, specifying the number commissioned, and the number still employed who had not been commissioned. THE DIVORCE BILL. Lord PALMEESTON having moved that the Lords' amendments upon the amendments made by the Commons in this Bill should be read, Mr. HENLEY complained that they had for 10 minutes been sitting doing nothing, while the right hon. gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department went out of the House t.o see whal the amendments were. This was hardlyadecentmodeof doing business. Theamendments ought to be considered not by!one side of the Hoase, but by b oth. Sir G. GREY explAined that the reason of the delay was, that when the Bil came dosra from the House of Lords it did not contain one important amendment which the publio newsppers .espresented had been made by their lordship viz., the irsertion of the provision that a sngle act of dultery on the part of a man should deprive him of the right to obtain a divorce on acount of the misconduct of his wife. They therefore sent for the officer of the House of Lorde, who informed them that no such amendment was made; 'that, in fict, the Commons' amendment, instead of being dissented from, was agreed to by a majority of four. (Hlear, hear.) The only amendments of the slightest consequence which had been made by their lordships were striking out 'quarter asessions" from the clause relating to jurisictis, and negativing the claue introduced by the noble lord the member for loioestershire as to adultery in the conjugal dwelling. The amendments were then read. Upon the first-viz., the omission from clanuse C, creating the local jurisdictions, of' the words " and courts of quarter sesdons respectively," Lord PALMERSTONT moved that the House should agree with the Lords in this amendment. :Mr. HENLEY should not object to the adoption of this motion, because he believed that both courts of and a of quarter sessions were qfite unfit to deal with these cases The motion was then agreed to, and an amendment rendered necesary by this was made in the latter partof the clause. Sir G. GREY then moved that the House should not insist upon the amendment which it had made by the insertion of the clause giving to a woman a right to divorcs on the groundof adultery. Mr. EENLEY sald that It was vey little use his expressing an opion upon this matter at this period of the session, but he must remind the House that this amend- i ment vas inserted with the consent of the Government, snd that none of the objections which were taken to it in the House of Lords were then urged against it. In his opinion the omission of this clause would greatly increase the injustice which this Bill would do to wonmen. (Hear.) A man might sedace the lady'smaid, the governess, or one of the domestics, might turn his house into a brothel, and still his wife would be without remedy, although for offences of a less insulting nature she was to have a remedy. He was anxious to record his protest against this injustice, and if he had the support of any other hon. members he should divide the House against this amendment of the Lords. Lord PALTERSTON said that the right hon. gentleman was mistaken in saying that the objections taken to this clause in the House of Lords were not raised by the Government in this House. He had himself stated at the time the amendment was made by the noble lord that in his opinion, there were certain objections, and among those objections to which he had referred was that it might open a door for collusion. He had, however, stated that, upon the whole, the balance of reasons appeared to be in favour of the amendment, and that he was therefore prepared to agree to it. INo one could disguise from him self that a husband committing adultery in the coniugal residence would commit a great outrage upon the feelings of his wife, which might strengthen her [claim to be separated from him; but, upon'the other hand, it might be presumed that such a proceeding would be of rare occurrence, and that the good feeling o. a man and a gentleman, and his deference to publo opinion and to the opinion of his relatives and fiiends, would prevent him, except in extreme c3ses of profligacy, from indulging in such practices. He should have been glad to maintain the words in the clause, but the right hon. gentleman must remember that their omission had been carried in the other House by a majority of 44 to 27, and that the proposal to omit them was made by a noble lord who be. longed to the same political party as the right hon. gentleman, and opposed in discussion and upon a division by the Government. (Hear, hear.) I;nder these circumstanoes, therefore, and considering that It would be unadvisable to enter into a discussion with the House of Lords upon an amendment which really wa s of no very great imporbance he hoped that the House wvould agree to tihe Lords' amendment. After some further conversation the House divided, when the numbers were:- A.1es ... ... ... ... ... ... 43 NTOW ... .. .. .. .. .,1 Majorlty The motion that the House of Commons should not insist upon its own amendment was thus carried, and the amendment of the House of Lords was agreed to, as were also the remaining amendmentp introduced Into the Bill by their On the motion of Mfr. HAvm1, a nmew writ was ordered to be issued for tho election of a representative for Middlesex in the room of Lord IL Grosvenor, who had accepted the office of Steward of H3er Maesws manor of Hempholme. Lord PALMERSTON then moved tbat, as there was no business before the House, and as it was likely that the prorogation of Parliament would take place on Friday next, the House should adjourn till that day. The motion was agreed to, sad the House immediaty zfter adjourned at 20 minutes to 4 o'clock.

At a special meeting of the Bank of Egypthis afternoon, Mr. W. lte, BLP., In the chair, thereport and accounts were unanimously adopted andt a first dividend declared of 6 per cent. apon thepaid-up capital, free of income-tax. The chara observed that the business of the bank since, ibsa formation has been conducted with the greatest cue, and that no hazardous transactons have been entered into with a view of securing a large profit. The directors have considered it advisble to establish a branch at Cairo, to which phaseall the productions of the interior are brought, andwhereaflourishing trade is carried on. Itis anticipated that this branch will be opened in abouta month, in time for the winter trade. In answer to a question the chairman stated that it is just possible to carry on the ne'r establirbment without additional capital, bat it is not thought desirable to pursue such a course, as it would weaken the position of the bank at Alexandria. A ceallwi therefore be made about the beginning of next year. Explanations were also given respectng theitem for rents, salaries, &c. In the course of the meeting It was stated that the railroad from Alexandria to Suez will be opened in about twvo months.

It appeasa that a dividend of about, lOs. in the pound- will be paid. The immediate cause of the suspension was stated to have been from losses arising principally from an alteration in the tariff on goods shipped to the United States. It was resolved to windup under an ignment, and Messrs. Crokat and Chatteriz were appointed trustees. A Government Bill now psasing purports to alteand amend the existing laws of the Customs. The great objects, however, of onsolidation and aimfication will not be much promoted, The firSt thng disposed of is the alteration of duty on certain articles. On felt hats the duty is reduced-from Is, t$ 6d. each; on French plums, prunelloes, and plums dried or preserved (except in sugar) from 1I. per cwt. to 7a.

THE DIYOACE BIZL AND THE AMXNADMZ"S PBOPOSED IN TPBA LORDS. Most of o.ur readers will have been grievoudy perplexed by the reports of the dis-cssions, in both Houwes of PLar1i xnent., with reference to the details, or, to xpeak technically, the separate caues of the Divorce Bill ia coznuittee of the I whole House, and on the last stage of the Bill in the House of Lordo; on the question of agreeing to the amendmiexts of the Co o . With the el of towing ame light on the matter, and cleriing away the uncertainty which must have clouded the minds of persons unaccustomed to the very peculiar forms of Parliamentary procedue, we gave eu Saturday a copious abstract of the Divorce Bil, ia Its last amended form. It Is probable, howrover, that the report ef the debate of Monday night In the House of Lords will agaia hare mystified the subjeot, and we therefore proceed very succinctly to explain, on the authority of the offcial " minuates " of the House of Peers, what was aotually done by their Lordshipe on Monday evening. First of all, Lord Redesdale made au attemptto shelve the Bill by moving to take the amendments of the Commons into consideration siT months hence; but his motion to that effect was negatived by a majority of 46 to 44 votes, proxies not being called for. Ot referring to the clanses of the Bill, Lord Granv511e gave up the jarisdiction in cases of divorce conferred bytihe House of Commons on courts of quaxter sessions, and in this case, of comse, no division occurred. On clau3e 25 Lord St. Leonard's moved to disagree with the amendment of the Commorn assigning as one reason for divorce "adultery committed" (by the husband) "in the conjugal re.- dence" and on the question "whether to agree" (i.e. to the amendments of the GCommons), the ' Contents" were 27, and the " Non-Contents" 44, So thai the words above quoted were expunged from the clause. The wvord " rape," however, as another ground for divorce from the husband, was retainediuthedlausebyamajorityof 45to29. Andthen, on clause 28, which provides for the dismlsal of a petition for the dissolution of a marriage if the eoirt- ehall find that the petitioner has during the marriage been accessory to or conniving at the adultery of the other psrty, &e., the Bishop of Oxford moved to reiastaite the words (streak out in the Commons) " guilty of adultery," thus mahdog the comans. sdon of adultery at any time duing the narriage a cause for the dismissal of the petition, or, in other-words, the refusalof the relief of divorce. Their Lordships having divided on the question " whether to agree to the Commonse amendmaent," the "Contents" were 39, andthe "NoniContents" 35 so that the words were not restored as erroneously stated ia our impression of yesterday; but, on the contrary, the Commons'amendment, which expunged the words in ques. tion, affirmed. Was not this clear from the text of the "' Winutes," the fact that the Bishop of Oxford, who was the anthor of the motion for reinstating the above words, voted with the " Non-Contents," or minority of 35 (together with his episcopal brethren of Chichester, LJncoln, Rochester, and Salisbury), would dispel all doubt on the subject. The Bishop of London voted with Minister In the majority on this occasion. The next dividon was on clause F (added by the Commons), allowing husbands to claim damages from the adulterous seducei of their late wives, and this clause was ordered to be retained by 77 to 67 votes (proxies were here called for). The Bishops of London, Chichester, and Rochester voted in the majority, and the Bishops of Oxford, Salisbury, and Lincoin with the minority, or " Non-Contents." On clause 53, containing the famous proviso about the refual of the clergy to remarry divorced ndulterer and adulteresses, the Bishop of Oxford moved to omit the words " on the ground of his or her adultery," the effect of which omission would have been tantamount toexempting the clergyfrom theduttyof solemncing the marriage of any person whose former marriage might have been dissolved for any cause 'whatever, and thus affirming the privilege of scrnpulous clergymen to refuse to remarry in any case. The words, how. ever, were ordered to stand part of the clause (i. c., were retained) by 37 to 32 votes, the Bishop of Londoa voting in the majority, end the Bishops of Oxford, Lineoln, Chichester, and Rochester with the " Non-Contents." The Bishop of Oxford next moved to disagree to the proviso added to clause 53, aud to the clause G, the one relating to the privilege conferred on the clergy to refuse to remarry parties divorced for adultery, and the latter to the saving clause ensoting that if the minister of any church or chapel refuse to perform that service, another ciergymau may. Their Lordships, however, affirmed the proviso and saving clause of the Commons by 37 to 27 votes. On this occasion the Bishop of London again voted with Ministers in the majority, and the Bishop of Winchester added his name to the list of the "Non-contents," or minority, in conjunction with his brethrenof Chichester, Oxford, Rochester, and Salisbury. It follows fromi this explanation that in only two cases were the amendments of the Commons disagreed to-first, as regards the jurisdiction of the courts of quarter sessions; and, secondly, as regards the "adultery committed in the conjugal residenoe" as a ground of divorce for the husban. The rest of the Bill remains intact and inviolate s it went up from the Honse of Commons, and by the time these lines meet the eye of the public the Bl will doubtless be ready to receive the Royal aent.

ZONYDON, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1857. In the House of Commons, Mr. ADD]nEY, referring to a statement by Mfr. LABoucrERE on the preceding day that the German legionaries at the Cape of Good Hope were on full pay at the expense of the British treasury, inquired the date when they were put on full pay, the causes and reasons, and whether they wete to be kept perimanently on full pay. Mr. LkBoucHxn, in the course of explanations upon the subject, stated that the Legion soon after I their a-rival at the Cape were for certain reasons called out and embodied; that Sir GEORno GREY: bad received an application from Bombay for two regiments of British troops, and that the Govern- maent were in communication with Sir GEORGE as to. the expediency of sending further reinforcements from the Cape. Inquiries upon other points were made by Sir CDE L.cy EvANs and Major S. WoRmxv. in reply to the former, Mr. V. SMInv skad it was not intended at preent 'to increase the force of the East Indla Company's xuropeen troops. On the consideration of the reamons asgned by the Lords for disagreeing with certain amendments of the Commons in the Divorce and matrimonial Causes Bill, Sir G. GRsY said there had been a mapprehension as to the effect of the Lordsl divison on the 28th clause, the majority having been in fact in concurrenc with the decision of the Commons. The amendment of the Lords excluding the quarter semions from the local jurisdiction clause was agreed to wlthout objection. The amendment omitting from the 25th clause the words " or of adultery committed in the conjugal residence" was opposed by Mr. Hma., and after some disussion the House divided, when the Lor' amendment wa carried (the Commons not insist. ing upon their own amendment) by 43 to 11. The House adjourned at 20 minutes to 4 o'clock until Friay.
The position of affaizs in India, and the growing demands upon the military resources of the country, have naturally attracted attention to the policy likely to be pursued on the re-embodiment of the Militia. Lord ELLmmOpOUGH, incommon with many others, is anxious that more than the specified number of Militia regiments should be recalled to the standards they have so recently left, and a mnore particular controversy touehing the principlo on which these defensive battalions should be officered, or the relations in which they should stand towaids the regular army, has been carried on at some length il our own columns. Some of our correspondents desire to see commimsions in the Militia confned for the most part to country gentlemen, according to the old eonat;tutional theory of the force; others would improve the effioiency of these regiments by an extensive employment of retired officers of the Line; and, while one party thinks that a force asumed to be necessary for the defence of the country should not be reduced by incessant draughts for the regalar army, another is as decidedly of opinion that in providing these levies of ready-trained volunteers in large numbers, and at short notice, the Militia discharges one of its most useful and appropriate functions. It is not often that we can enter upon a subject of public discussion with such entire satisfawtion as in the case before us, for the truth is, not only that all parties have some reason on their side, but that all may receive a reasonable gratification at one and the same moment. As regards tho. principles which should govern appointments in the Militia, it need only be remarked that there really exists no conflict of interests, and sometimes, indeed, no distinction at all, between the two classe put forward for preference. Not only is there ample room in every Militia regiment for country gentlemen and retired officers together, but in manyinstances the character would be actually identical and united in a single person. It was only the other day that we inserted a lettler in defence of the sentiments which make military service regarded rather as a pastime than a profension by the more opulent classes of society, and so largely, indeed, is the army officered from gentlemen of landed estate that few of those country families from which Mlitia officers would in the first instance be sought are without some members who have served or are serving in the Line. Here, then, would be the specimen in which the two qualifieations would combine, and for the rest we need only say that retired officers and country gentlemen can find space enough to serve side by side with satisfaction, and advantage to boot. The latter class may sustain the peculiar distinctions of the corps and exert perhap the remnant of feudal authority over tenantry or retainers in bringing levies to the ranks; the former may introduce those tr;aitions and usages of actual service, which count for so much in establishing the efficiency of a regiment. We really think that none of our correspondents would wish, upon reflection, to see the Militia of a county either officered from the half-pay list, to the exclusion of the county gentry, or deprived altogether of the benefit which a leaven of real military experience must confer. On the principles which should regulate volunteering for the Line we may offer remarks of a similar character. Certainly, it is hard that offices after expending considerable pains in bringing a Militia regiment into a good state of discipline and efficiency should see al their best men swept away into the Line, and find themselves obliged to commence their labours anew. On higher grounlds of policy, too, it is reasonable enough to argue that if 50,000 Militiamen are to ba raised and maintained for home service, the professed object of their embodiment is defeated by a practice which drains them off by thousands for service abroad. To these objections, however, it is obvious to reply -and to appeal to actual experience for confirmation of the argument-that, as a matter of fact, volunteering from Militia regiments for the Line can and does go on without producing the consequences apprehended. That the results may cause occasional vexation to officers the fruits of whose exertions are thus appropriated by others is undoubtedly true, but the reflection that the great end of all-the service of the country-is signally promoted by the proceeding ought to carry sufficient consolation, and more than one letter in these pages has proved that such is actually the caue. It must not be forgotten that when a good system of recruiting is once established men come in as fast as they go off. The continual replacement of the units composing a battalion is an inevitable condition of military service. In the field the men fall or are invalided by the fortune of war; at home they pass off in due course to this sterner and moro exciting clas of duties. Volunteering represent the easualties of a Militia orps, and is to be met, like other casualties, by constant recruiting. As a good regiment of the Line, though rarely constituted for six months together of the same soldiers, is always fit for duty, so a good regiment of Militia will maintain its efficiency though constantly losing scores of its men. The flow of the stream is uniform throughout, and the Militia exhibits but one section of the eurrent. In the actual operation of the system little difficulty is found. If Militia regiments lose their soldiers by sweeping draughts, on the other hand they complete their numbers with greater facility. Many a man will join the muster of his own county, under the command of his own squire, and on limited terms of service, who would not at once embrace a military profession by enlisting into the Line; but, finding the duty agreeable, the treatment good, and the prospect seductive, he quits this probationary sphere for the realities of his new avocation, and leaves his place to be supplied by others, who may either follow him or not. With respect to the strength at which it may be adviasble to maintain our home forces, the question, however it may be decided, is at any rate free from difficulties. We have plenty of money and plenty of men. Independently of the response which would assuredly be made to any calls upon the national energies, we are as yet not exposed to any material enlargement of our ordinary obligations. As Lord ELLBoRoouOG observed on Monday evening, a snm of more than half a million of money, already provided for in the Estimates, will be left disposable in consequence of the transfer of the charge to the East Indis Company. Since the Company pays for the troops employed in Indis, every regiment despatched to India, while it weakens our establishment by the abstraction of men, relieves our Exchequer at the same moment by the amount of its cost. It remains only to apply the money thus available in replacing the men, and there is certainly no reason why this proceeding should be attended -with embarrasment. We are in the habit of regarding our resources in this respect as somewshat circumscribed, but the fact, in so far as it really existg, must be due simply to the numerous diversions created by national and commercial prosperity. In our actual numbers there is no deficiency. France rassone of thestrongest armies in the world from a population which exceeds that of these islands only by a miion or two. We can probably reckon close upon 30 millions, while France, perhaps, wcarely reaches 35. True it is that our marine, initxvarious departments, absorbs a large number of men, and our colonles many more; but the mere staitics of emigration show how thickly our home territory is peopled. A country whicl can lose without the smalest exhaustion 1,000 men a-day must needs have resources of this ciaracter in abundance. If we rely upon the voluntary efforts of the population, and if the responses in this respect are apt to be affected by the opportunities open in all directions to enterprise and vigour, these are circumstancea which speak more forcibly than ever for the real power of the nation, nor can we feel the smallest apprehension that any call based upon the requirements of the national service will be left without a prompt and all-sufficing answer.
A Report from the CommJssioners on Common Law Judicial Busines3 will not attract msny nonprofeaional readera except in the provinoial towns, which, iRitl nmore or lea reason, aspire to the attainment of independent Asie. Leeds and Wakefield are impatient of the traditional supemacy of York; Birmingham loDkS down on Warwick; Wisbeach complains of the distance which separates it from Cambridge; Bristol is dissatisfied with its annexation for criminal purposes to Glocester, and with its annual Civil Assize; and Hull resents the discontinuance since 1794 of Assizes which were granted by a charter of EDWARD I. The Commissioners decide against aU these applications, with the single exception that they recommend a second Civil Assize for Bristol, but the demand of Manchester for separation from Liverpool has been found irresistible. In the chronic rivalry between the two great northern capitals of industry it was but fair that the manufactirers should triumph in their turn. Liverpool may continue for the present to extort Town Dues from its neighbour; but the cotton district wilf be grouped for judicial purposes around their natural centre. It cannot be doubted that the municipal patriotism of Manchester will readily provide the buildings and accommodation which necessarily form the preliminary conditions of the propesed change. When 20,000 Welsh farmers and labourers have a commission of their own, a million of busy workers in Lancashire, of whom some could buy up a Welsh county, may reasonably require a similar indulgence. Plans for the redistribution of the Circuits affect the public interests only so far as they enable the Judges to discharge their dutiers with the greatest economy of time; bat the general indifference to proposals of the kind furnishes an amusing contrast to the indignant partisanship of the Bar. The proceedings of the Commission are j watched by lawyers with the feelings which agitatedc minor potentates when Nx3rv cEENl and CAsTr.z RnAGH, NEssnimoDB and HARDRNnuRG, were reconstructing the map of Europe at Vienna. Is Prussia to have Saxony? Is the Oxford Ciremit to appropriate Warwick? The disruption of York from its old northern associations is like the severance of the Franconian Pr2cipalities from the house of HoHnmNzoLsNn,whichtheyhadcradledin its infasey. There can be no doubt that any alteration of the Circuits materially affects profesional interes Few even of the most eminent leaders of the Bar are independent of local connexion, and the juniors are still more closely bound to the spots. where they have succeeded in obtainuing a footingThe individual losses whieh may be thus occasioned furiish a sufficient reason against any capricious. disturbance of existing arrangements; but in the long interval which has elapsed since the organization of the present Circits the movement of population hs greatly alteed the relative importance of various distric&. It seems that some scheme similar to that proposed by the CommisisioerS should be adopted once for all, so au to obviate the necessity for further alterat;ons antil two or three generations have passed by. The Judges anel lawyers on the Cosmission were probably not wanting in sympathy for their profession, and they may have considered that practitioners in full business at York or Warwick wiU probably be able to hold their groun agaimnst any importation of foreigners. Another question under consideration was that of the proper number of Common Law Judges, and the Commissioners unanimousy recommend the maintenanee of the full establishment. It may be remembered that one of Mr. GLADSTONe'S principal illustrations of the profligate extravagance of the Government was derived from the appointment of a new Judge in the place of Baron ALDXBSsoN. In all the publichouses in Flintahire, as well as below the gangway in the House of Commons, the indignant orator denounced the creation or maintenance of au alleged sinecure almost as loudly as if he had been proving that a reduction of only 20,000,0001. in the Estimates was equivalent to a warlike manifesto. It seems that the opposite opinion is entertained by the attorneys of London, represented in the Council of the Law Society; and any doubts which may be entertained of the correctness of their conclusion may easily be dispelled by a perusal of Baron BELRAwE's oral diary of his judicial occupations. When a Judge has transacted business in court from 10 to 3, and then sat in chambers till 5, two or three hours' work in consulting authorities and drawing up judgments after dinner seems to complete a day of adequate industry. Baron BBWAxv informs the Commissioners that he had no time to read the reports when he was at the bar, but that he cannot allow the public to suffer by similar negligence on the bench. It is fortunate that those lively publications are rather more interesting than serial novels to a thorough-bred speoial pleading lawyer. Justice COLERIDOE remarks, not without reason, that the profession and the public would be injured by debarring a Judge from the enjoyment of society and from all cultivation of liberal pursuits. The Scotch understand better the dignity of the Bench, when they intrust the business of a population equal to that of London to a staff of Judges as numerous as that of England and Wales. Some of the reasons urged by the Commissioners against the reduction of the judicial strength throw an interesting light on the results of recent changes in the law. The County Courts, with their causes numbered by hundreds of thousandsthe Common Law Procedulre Act, abolishing many technical processes of litigation-the Bill of the present SoLcITon-GENmful for signing judgment on bills of exchange-all these improvements, and others of the same kind, while they have destroyed frivolous and undefended actions, have actually allowed an increase of serious legal business. The new practice by which the evidence is summed up at its close tends to increase the length of Nisi Pt-4s trials, and a similar effect is produced to a greater extent by the admission of litigants as witnessm. In a large proportion of cas the defendant must either tell his own story or acquiesce in the hostile statement of facts, and the counsel who is then obliged to call evidence has no motive for relying on the testimony of a single witness. The actal inreas of important litigation, however, is a more satisfactory method of accounting for the additional labours imposed on the Judges. Twenty years ago the laws of England were carefully devised for the purpose of rendering the attainment of justice as difficult as possible. Plaintiffs were liable to be defeated by the most preposterous quibbles, while defendants had no sufficient security against scandalously unjust claims. The ironical eulogy on an eminent judicial fumotionary, "Leges Angliae ad absurdum redxit," might fitly have been extended to the Bench at large, and, negatively at least, to the Legislature. The consequence was that innumerable compromises were effected, and that Cause-Lists were often made up of those classes of actions which, under the present system, never come before the superior courts. If the medical profession were in want of employment their leisure would probably be attributable rather to want of onfidene. on the part of patients than to the absence of disease. Stagnant litigation sometimes indicates rather that justice is not to be had than that it is not required. The Commiwsioners state with truth that " recent Acts "of Parliament, isuch as those which relate to "interpleading, Joint-Stock Companies, Railways, "and particularly the two Common Law Pro- " cedure Acts, have introduced entirely new "4 matters of business, far outweighing in diiculty ' and importance those which have ceasedato exist." g5o muoh yet remains to be done that it i highiy desirable to impreis on the pforemlo±i the coizoldence of tneir own interets with those of the comnmunity. The gates of law reform are unavoidably kept by lawyers, but it may be hoped that they will be nady to open them when they can do so with advantage to themselves.
Sir WiTTr& CoDnmGGTOx is appointed to the commaud of-the Prince of WAnss. The " Court " Circular " announces that this distinguished General has gone to Eonigrwinter, on the Rhine, to be in attendance on the youthful Prince. The public will perhaps, in these times of war and tumult, have anticipated other commands for the great Crimean soldier,-not more honourable, of course, but perhaps more arduous. We will not believe that bis youthful Royal Highness really requires a first-rate General to manage him. He is, from everything we have been able to hear, a most good-natured, amiable young Prince, endowed with a sweetness of disposition which softens down all the stiffness of rank, and endears him to all who are placed around him. We allow that sixteen is a trying age; it is the age when manhood fist dawns, and life begins to open out with its new impulses and activities. Sixteen , indeed, pronounced by the authorities of the drawing-room to be an intolerable age. Mothers, atrs, and sisters fear sixteen, and resign themselves meekly to the approach of a period of triaL Sixteen puts the schoolmaster on his mettle, and keeps his nerves and courage braced, ready for the fght. We do not underrate the difficulties of its management and proper control. Still, even at its worst, " sixteen" might have been controlled by somebody who had not blown up Sebsatopol, and, softened as it is, if not qite subdued, by Royal rank aad the best of dipositions in the present case, it would most probably have yielded to the tutorial guidance of a quiet, sagacious civilian, who had never brandished a sword, or sent battalions to mortal strife. Even clergymen have been known to undertake the task of superintending our young Princes, so peaceful an occupation has it been thought, and so little connected with the art of war. Some rather less formidable and lcss commanding personage, then, than Lieutenant-General CODRINGToN, K.C.B., Grand Cross o the Sardinian Order, Companion of the Legion of Honour, of the Order of tne Medjidie, &c., and late General of the English Forces in the Crimea, could have directed the young Prince's tour up the Rhine, could have pointed out to him the prnci;pal towns and castles, and conducted him to the best hotels. The General, we observe, has gone to Konigswinter, doubtless to be in time to head the arduous ascent of the Drachenfels, which his Royal Highness has resolved upon. We do not say that a great eoifmander might not be of service in this undertadrig; we know from our own experience that it is not wholly devoid of difficultie The race of donkeys is not allways to be depeded on; sometimes a humour of disobedience comes over them, an inclination to do anything but facilitate your progress, a determinaiion in the tribe to congregate in corners, with their riders upon them, and block up their own pathway. Some address is required to untie these Gordian knots, and no ascent, we are quite sure, was ever made in this world-not even an asent of twenty minutes-which did not task in some degree the virtue of patience. Still, a less distinguished General thau Sir W unaAt CoDsn;%ow could restore marching order on such occasions, and lead the way successfully up these stupendous heights. It is true that terrific legends and traditions of war hover round the top, and the story of the awful combat between SixOFRExD and the Dragon might come suitably from military lips. But, whatever may haTe been the horrors of the past, the present view from the top of the Drachenfelz is eminently peaceful, exhibiting the ample reaches of a magnificent river, flowing between cornfields and vineyards. And the same may be said of the whole of the Rhine; it is an eminently peaceful river now; with the exception of Ehrenbreitstein, its fortresses belong to the past ; its present is an era of high cultivation and adornment, grapes and gardens, steamers and hotels. The declivities of the banks exhibit the triumphs of spade labour, by which not a foot of the invaluable slope, with its precious southern aspect and sunshine, is lost to the husbandman. The Prince would not, probably, look for much instruction in the art of war from the monuments of the old medisval robbers who sallied forth to levy blackmail upon merchant vesselt. These picturesque ruins only heighten the luxurious peacefulness of the scene, and probably Sir WUrAl CODnINGTOC wilU be the last person to "improve the occasion," like DOGALDDA.LGr-r, as he passes them, into a lecture upon the science of war to his Royal pupiL He wi be the firt to yield to the triurmphant peacefulness of the scene, to wave war with its terrors aside, and convert himeelf into the genial, easy, deferential companion of future Royalty. Then, what need of such a mighty warrior at all, and why enlist the " nodding horrors' of a Crimean General's plume in such a service ? We must frankdy confess that this appears rather a "drop" for General CODRNGToN-the fall, we mean, from the command of the Crimean army to the command of--we say it with all respect and deference, but stil it is the fact-a boy of 16or, to spealk in the language of the " Court " Circular," " to attendance upon his Royal "Highness the Prince of WALES" in his tour unp the Rhine. When the late Archbishop of CATEBuRtY was raised from the position of a private clergyman to that of Bishop of London, an old Peer asked what the qualifications of the fortunate unknown were. The informant blundered and hesitated, talked about theological reading and clerical aocomplishments, scholarship, &:c. At last by accident he hit upon the fact that the late Prelate was a tutor to the Marquis of AnzacoaN's son, and had always got on with the Marquis very well. The old Peer was immediately satisfied. " Oh, if he managed AaimoniL he could mage "1 anybody, or any diocess." Here is a rise from the management of one to the management of many. Sir WnMX CODIUrGTON reveres the process. He rises from the governent of many to that of one. He has prepared himself by leading the Crimean army to direct the young Prince of WAr.ss. The conduct of the Russian war fits him to conduct a Rhenish tour. But hera is the whole East in gome way or other in arms with us-China resisting,. India murtinying, Generals dying e-very post-Axsow by one, BAnNAID and Lwiw Ncm by another-important commands are empty and want flhing, an(d the Commander of the Crimean army is " going to 55 iSnigswinter to be in attendance on the Prince "4 of WAnas." Has General CODBIGTON, having gained European, no ambition for Indian honours? Or in he such a courtier that the successful direction of the PrinOc of WALx's Rhine tour has a greater attraction in his eyes than the suppreasion of an enormous Indian mutiny?

SECOND EDITION. THLE TIMEOFFICE, Wediyday Moing. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris oorre* spondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m.- The Turkish question remins in stdu qzw as far as intelligence from Constantinople goes; that is t) say, we are still waiting to learn that it has pleased Lord Stratford to obey the orders of his Govenment. Is he, on his part, waiting a reply to the representation or remonstrance with which he met those orders? The soldier's first duty isimplicit obedience, but this rule is evidently not considered by the British Ambassador at Constantinople to apply to the veterans of diplomacy. It is time, however, that this anomalous statej of things should oease, since foreign Governments cannot be expetd to show the same indulgence to Lord Stratford's vagaries that has been frequently extended to tbem by English Cabines. A difference of opinion, which tor a moment wore a serious, although not an alam. ing aspe¢t, was atisfactorily settled in a brief and ami-able conferenos between the two Sovereigns, assinted by their mcet trasted counsellors. In cmformit with the agreement come to, instructions were sent to Lord Stratford, who not only leaves them unexecated, but, as we are assred, indaoec his colleague of Austria to foRow his example. It is presumed that the English Government has reitarated its instraetionr, and that this time they ae so peremptory as to ensure prompt obedience. To suffer the British Ambassador at Constantnople to peolong the present unsetled and unsatiactory state of thinge would be to furnish a pretext for imputaons of an unpleasant nature, and to wbich no Government, however securm. of its own honsty of purpoee and good faith, ahould risk exposing itself Hler MaJes*y'a M\inisterm decide on a certain measure, to be carried out by their representative at a fo4elgn Court; instead of obeying, he cai3s. The natural ooawuence would appear to be his recalL Is it Lord Stratford or the Queen's Couleil of linse lhatdirects the foreign policy of England? The above lines were written when inteligene rewhed me of the settlement, in an unexpected manne, of the question at issue. In conform4t with.instructions he ha. just received, the Tarkdsb Ambassaor at Paris has informed the Emperor's Government of the Sultn's consent ta annul the Moldavieu elections, in. somupliance with, the wishes of the- foar Powers. By this arrangement England and Austfia may be said, lo be ignored. Their representatives at Constantinople appear to have done nething towards re-establishing unanimity of action.. After the harmonious concert at-Osborne, this note'rom the Bosphors rather jars upon the ear. They difficulty, however, is at an endF, and the French. Government hold itelf satisfied, After a. long conferences yesterday betw.enl the: Emperor and Count Walewaki, a telegraphic despatch was-forwarded to M£ Thouvenel at Cbnstantinople. Without pretending to a positive. knows ledge of ite contents, we may risk the conjecture that it enjpined the French. Ambmsador to hold himeelf in readinaess to start at. short notice; for it was decided that if by 8 o'clock this evening, for which hour a Council of Ministe is aummoned,, the annulling of the elections wva not consented to by the Porte,. passports were forthwith to be prepd and sent tothe Tarkish Ambseador in Paris, while orders wre-to be despatched to K Thoavenel to leave Constantinople. For the last few days the-Turkish difficulty hs been the absorbing topic, and, scarcely any one-has. noticed a small cloud that has been gathering in another quacter. There in bad blood between the Courts of Turin and Naples, and diplomatic intercourse has, become envenomod. The bone of contention is the steamer Cagliari and the Sardinian passengers who were capturedz on board her. Piedmont insist-that ship and prisoners shoald at once be given upb, and certainly, if the published acoounts be strictly correct of the manner in which the Cagliari was obtained poesessioi.of by the Maszji the persistence is reasonable sad should be comliead with. But Naples is said to.have replied to the demand by am insinuation that the Piedmontes Government. might have done more than it didc to. prevent the recent revolutionary attempts in Italy. Thus, at least, it has beei stated in certain foreign papers. I am assured that the King of Sardinia is. a- posed to. carry matters with a high hand, and. he is said to be determined, if Naples refuses hi* request, not only to withdraw his Ambassador, but also to deciare war. One0 ha difficulty in. beliving that hb- would so promptly adopt so strong aM neasure. I need hardly point out that, if ha did, the affair woucld be most seious, and might very probably be fatal to the peace of Europe. Austria would at once side with Naples Austria, however, is by no means desirou of seeing things come to such a pass, and is doing her utmost to make up the qxarreL The latest aceounts received in Paris are a shade more favourable than the preeding ones to a peaceable settlement of the quarrel, but there still are grounds for some little uneasiess. Private letters from Madrid continue to speak of Palace intrigues, in opposition to the Narvaez ministry, and to which the Queen, with her wellknown love of mischief, complacently lends herselfThe affair of the waste lands at Barcelona, concern. ing which I lately wrote, could not be finally arranged to the satisfaction of the ruling favourite, and he is, consequently, more inveterate than ever against the Cabinet. There has been a sharp akirmish between Narvaez and the Palace, and it is said that the Premier went so far as to offer his re. aignation, which was not accepted. He was i>formed, however, that if he insisted, it and that of his colleagues would be asepted. The cause of quarrel was a scurrilous lampoon, directed at Narvaez, and which he ascartained to have been concocted by persons connected with the Paace. He has arrested and exiled a certain Don Joni Montbarat, notwithstandig his quality of VapoyG in the -Royal Patzmmon. The object of the plot was to get rid of the present Minters, but, when it came to the point, the Queen lacked courage to accept theresiganation of Narvaez. Some people think that, although this combiation has failed, another will succeed. Meanwhile Narvaez appears extremely tranquil, and from this it is inferred that he really wishes to go oat. If so, it may, perhapa, be taken as a proof of sagacty and political foresight on his part-at least if it hb true, amany believe, that he is the only mnn in1 Spain capable of keeping together the cray machine of the State. He says himself that no ;inistry that may succeed him wiU be able to maintain order, and that the more liberal it may seek to be, the less will be its power. This is very much like saying that a reactionary de3potism is the only Government now possible in Spain; and truly, after all that has been witnessel of the blunders, the imbecility, and the self-seeldng of the so-called " I.iberals," one is tempted, however unwillingly, to incline to that opinion. If -Narvaez resigned and his successors proved incapable of governing, he might return to power with flying colours and a long lease.

ESAAPE OF A ClTI1NAi tlWO F3ROM BEDJLAI -No little sensation hM been created among the officdls of Bethlehem Hospital in consequence of the eecpe of a crii. nil lunatic under circumstances that appzosimate the darig exploits of the renowned Jack Sheppard. From the particu. lars obtained it appears that a man named Joseph E3Un had been liberated cn a ticket.of-leave, he havilg been convicted f. r felony. Since that he had been again apprelended for felony, tried at Exeter awizes in December, 185, and sentenced to 15 years' transportation. After being inearoerated in Milibank prison some time, he was pronounced to bo iGgane, and was in consequence removed to Bethlehera Hce. pitaL On Friday, upon going to the man's dormitory, the kteper Lwas astonished at finding that the prisoner hal escaped, and a large hole made in the wall, which itwas quite clear had been made by the prisoner, through which he hai got out. A sheet and a blanket had been tied together and by those means he succeeded in sliding down into thetimeet, a distance considerably over 20 feet, and then got clear off. The authorities are of opinion that it must have taken the man nearly a week to bore the hole in the wall, asa how he had enoceeded In accomplishing his object without observation appears a perfect miracle. The polieo have been ac5ively engaged in looking a&fter We lunatic, but he haa not yet been apprehended.

THE ACCIDB.NT ON THE LONDON AND BRIGHTON BALJVW F. Yesterday evening Edward Taylor, the driver of the engine of the passenger traia which came into eollision with the goods train on U~onday, was placcd before Mr. G. Lyall and Mr. J. Compton, at the Town-hall, Reigate, charged with havng neglected his duty while hAving the care of- his engine, thereby endangering the lives of the paengers travelling on the London, Brnghton, and South Coast Railway on monday. Mr. Faithfull prosecuted; Mr. Burgon appeared for the prisoner. Some discussion took place as to the oompany's rule, r. Bargon declining to admit them, upon which Mr. Faithfil proposed to place sufricient evidence before the magistrates to warrant a remand, to give time to produce the or1ginal doomnents. Mr. Faithfili said the prisoner was charged, under the 5th and 6bh of Victoria, sec. 17, for the Rlation of Railways, with having omitted to do that which he was required to do by the rules of the company ; and it would be a question for the magistrates whether they would dispose of the ca,e sumamarily, or send it to a hieher tribunaL William Lucas stated that he was the head guard of the up-train from Brighton on the 24th inst. The plawe where the collision occurred was a gooeb tation, some short distance from the Reigate station on the Brighton side. There were two signals at the goods sation-a distanoe signal and a semaphore-for the up-line, and the same for the down line. In coming up on the morning in question -witness was riding in the front break-van, the second carriage frem the engine. On nearing thegoods station witness noticed that the distanoe signal was ful on. The train was going at the rate of about 25 or 30 miles an hour. Witness applied his break directly, but the train passed the signal until it ran Into the tmruks of the "picknUV train, which was partly in the siding and partly oa the main up-line. They were then near the semaphore. The engine driver had his steam on when he passed the distance signal, but he tumed it off and reverisebdtheengine immediatel afterwards. Witness sat by hiis break till the collison tool place, and then got out as soon as the violence of the shock was over. The paener train was very little damaged. There was a coniderable number of passengers in it. Several of them were cutabout the face and eyes, and aome about the shins, but they could all walk away very well. Mr. Burgon oross-examined the witness at great length, with a view to show that he ought to have seen the signals and communicated with the driver. It appoared also that it is customary tO have a wire communicating from the driver to the guard, tht on this occasion the wire -was out of order and w ould not work The hour beinlg lat the Court adjourned till Friday, tak:ing bail for the prisoner ir. 20Qi.

TEE INDIAN MUTINISS. The folowing Is3 a copy of a letter from Adolphus de Kantzow, who so greatly distinguished himself at Meerut ;- " MYNPOOREE, .TNE 19. "tTe following is a correct copy of a lett*r from the Governor-Geieral to mne, just received rid Agra The dik was the last from Calcutta, and just before the rod a closed "' Government-house, Calcutta, June 7,1S57. "'My dear Sir,-I have jast read, In a report from the mRaglstate of Mynpooree, the acoonut of your conduct upon the occasion of the mutiny ef a portion of the 9th Beginent of Native fntry at that station on the 22d ult. I have red it with an admiration and respect I cannot adequately decribe. " ' Young in yeas, and at the outset of your career, you have given to your brother soldiers a noble example of courage, patience, goo- judgment, and temper from which many maJ profit. " ' I beg You to believe that it will never be forgotten by me. " ' I write this at onoe, that there nay be no delay in mnakig knowL to you thxt your conduct has not been overlooked. You will, of course, receive a more fonnal acknowledgment through the military department of the Governmeut of your admirable service. "' I am, my dear Sir, yours very faithfully, ' CANNING. "'leuten3nt de Kantzow, 9th B.N.I.'"' The following is the lieutenant's own account oi his exploit:- "I was returning from reconnoitring, when information ws brought me ihalt five troopers of the 7th Light Cavalry were coming along the road. An immediate pursuit was of e3rse ordered by me, and my 39 troopers tore away at full speed after me. I ws just eoming up to them, and bAd aUieady let drive among the murdering villains, when lo! I cane upon 200 of their comrades, all armed with swords and some with carbines. A smart fire was kept up aS a dis. tene of not more than 25 yards. What corld 39 do aganst 200 regular troopers well horsed and armed, particularly when walkedinto by the bullets of 100i of theiWantry? Iordereda retreat, but my cavalry could not get away from troopers mounted upon good stud bred horses; so we were soon over. taken, and then commenced the shindy in earnest; 12 troopers surrounded me; the first, a Mahommedan priest, I shot through the breast just as he was cutting me down; this was my only pistol, so I was helpless as regerds weapons, save my sword; this guarded off a swinging cutt given me by No. 2, as also another by Nlo. 3, bat the fun could not lasI I bitterly mourned not having a couple of revolvers, for I could have shot every man. My sword ws cut down, and I got a slash on the head that blinded me, another on the arm that glanced, aul only took a slice off. The third caught me on the sifie, but also glanced and hit me sideways. I know not how I escaped. God only knovws, as 12 against one were fearful odds, especially as I was mounted on a pony bare back. Escape, how. ever, I did, and after many warm escpes too numerous to mention I got back here. 14 of my brave fellows were killed, four wounded, six missng : total, 24, out of 39. Good odds, ws it not?" Hesays inanotherletter(referring,itisfancied, tohis saving the gaol at Mynpooree from destrnction) that he has been pralsedbytheMajor.GeneraL,Lleutenant-Governorof Bengal and his doings brought to the notice of the GovernorGeneral; and he is now in command of the station of Myn. pcoree, and the remains of three native regiments there-. an irregular force, ia fact, It.EER17T, "MERT, JuvNE 26, "Our great safety lles with the Sikhs and Ghoorkas The mutineers in Delhi came out thbe other day to fight, and some hundred of them, seeing a paty of Sikhs cooking, threw aside their arms and said 'C ome to us; we are your brothers.' Tk-e S1khs said nothing, but when the mutineers came up killed every one. The Ghoorkas have behaved like Englishmen. When they advanced to the charge the mutineers called out, ' We respect you; come to us.' ' We are coming,' said the Gocrkas, and they did come, They fought like devils. We have lost many men, I regret to say. We have fortified ourselves here, and are expecting an attack from about 2,000 mutineers. We have here about 700 men to grd the place, and shall meet them just outside the station with about 300 or 400men-allwe can spare, as we bave barracks and many women to protect. We are ready, and have always been day and night. Pickets out on ali aidee-guns, &c., and cavalry, as many as we have. We lie down ready for an alarm. When Delhi is taken head-quarters will be here. Two movable colucmns will be formed here, as troops ar assembling down the country. However, in the field we can easily thrash them. The walls of Delhi alone have kept them alive and together. Our bayonets are all powerful; it seemsas if nothing could stand against them. In spite of the times we still drive out every evening on the course; but it will be some time before any one (except a man well mounted and armed) will be able to trvel at alL There have been schemes for volunteers here going out, in which I have joined, of oourse, but in vain. The General here is so awfullycautious. Iam on picket duty every other night and twice a-week for 24 hours, day and night. The men are on duty every night, and are hard worked; horses saddled day and night in cane of an attack. We have some of the 60th Rifles and Artilery recruits, who, though not drilled, are stanch fighters, and some of them old soldiers. We bave oar orders in case of an attack, and each one k.nows his position, and can reach it in a minute. We have a very formidable little place here, with bastions, &-o., complete, heavy and light guns, and 100 volunteers to msu the wall. They little expect how wo are prepared for them if they do come. My belief is they will go to Dsli; but if nok, as said before, weo shall not wait for them, bat go out to meet them, while they will expeot us crowded in our fortifications. They must be different from all the other rnutineers, and we very different from all thb other Eanglish, if we do not give them a thorough beating, and perhaps get their treasure (eight lacs of rupees). The fortifications must only be our last resource, as thoy are too small to hold every one. The natives iu the bazaar (the worst characters we bave) are as 'humble and quiet now as possible, and seemed terrified at us. We have hung and flogged so many that they see they cannot commit atrocities unpunished The mril goes such a roundabout way from here (the ordinary route not baing open) that I must send this off at once. The country is all up." AILAHABAD. The following letter is from an officer at Allahabad:- "June 23. "I may not have another opportunity of sending you a few words, as we have lots of hard work before us. I wrote IoU from Calcutta just before leaving on the 4th inst,, and by dint of pushing on day and night I arrived with six brother officers at Benares on the: 9th, just after the mutiny of the native troops at that station, Fortunately for the residents there a few of my regiment, with Colonel Neil and two coi. panles of Her Majesty's 10th Regiment, had arrived two days before the row commenced, Colonel Nell, a man of energy, sa-w at once the sate of affirs, superseded the brigadier, and took command of the station, ordered a parade, and proceeded to disarm the native regiment It has ince come out in evidence that that very night the native roops were to have raurdered the whole of the Europeans in garrlson. "When the natives saw what as intended they ih. atantly rusbhd to their arms, the Sikb reeient joiningthem, and poured a volley into the Europeans, killing about 10. However, the guns, two in nmnber, commenced at them with grpe; my regiment, with the 10th, poured volly after rolleyinto them, and even foUowed them lnto teir lines, et fire to them and burnt a great mnTsy, -ad the affair ws over, for we had no cavalry to follovr, they havig m'dedwith the mutineers at the commencement. All that have sinoc been caught have be hanged at onoe. "I arrived, asI aid, on the morning of the 9th; that same evening Colonel Neil took mc wFith 40 of our men to en- deavourtosaveorheip tie garr$on of this place, a most important fort, having the lagest arsenal in th" part of ldia, Hehad, however, sent on 50 of our men before, and they arrived the morning after the mutiny of the nativo froops here, but in time to save and hold theforL My party rnived on the lltb, doing upwards of 70 miles in two nights by aid of a lot of natives pushing our men along in light four-wheeled cariages. "The moment Colonel Neill arrived he setto workto turn the villains out of the city and cantonments, but I must tell you on the night they mutinied the offieers of the 6th Bengal Native Infantry, 17 in num"'er, were at mess; these murderers sounded the alarm bugle, got all their officers on the parade ground, and then fired into them, illing 14 out of the 17. They tben went round the canton. ment, burning all the houses, killing men, women, and children, and committing all kinds of atrocities. Well, the Colonel snt out a party of our men, DO in num- her, to attack and clear the city, or rather The suburbs. We lost two men kled and five wounded, and one officer, but it so frightened them that the next morning they all bolSed. A much stnger party, 200 of our men ulnder my oommand, with gens and cavalry, the whole under Colonel Neill, swept righi through the cantonment, and a steeaer went along kktrijkysxtthgu, and we ae now rretty quiot at thL1 plare, though the hangman isat work daily and the Colond is not the man to sPare them. "He (theColonel)ismow hirdastwrkgeW h foroet. ether to move on to the asvistence of CwpOfe and Lucknow, both places being it the greatest dange, forali the Sepoys that have run away are now gathering aroud Lucknow. Onrraportsoolcerningthat city and Cwnporsarer ost gloomy, but reports in thig country and at this ibb are alwa against US. You can have no Idea Of the awl weather and of our sufferig frora the heat; we ait with wret cloths over our heads, bat the deaths from san sroke' continue large; that dreadful wcourge cholera ba aWlo broken out, and we have lost already 70 fighting men We buried 20 three nights ago at one funeral, and the srieks of the dying were something awful; two poor ladies who were living over the hospital died, I believe, foKm fright. We have now got about 400 men outaide the fort, and the diease is certainly on the deolin Up to to-day we have had little to eat; indeed, I would niot have fed a dog with my yssterday's breakfast, but our mews and the head-quarters anrived yesterday, and our fare was much letter to-day. AU the village people ran away, and any one who had worked for the Europeans theme murderers killed, so if the population was to a man against us we sbould stand but a bad chance. A poor baker was foand with both his hands cut off, and his nose slit, bcause he had seut in bread to ns. I need not sayhow anxiouslywe all look for a largearmy fromEngluad. We can hold our own well enough till it arrives, bult India was never in such a mess, and it requireB ainy a strong arm and a wise head to put it in order again. The Bengal army is to a man against us, and I am very nenogs abont adras and Bombay; one single mischapoe, and those two armies follow. Ifully expezt to go o in tAdvance vith the: first party to Cawapore, so shall finish this off hastily, as we orny get a few honus notic I have writen to my pDor' wife, begging her to go home as quick as sbe an, for I ean not bear the idea of her being in such a country at mcha tme, and I wonld give all I have to knoew she was on 'her way. We canot leave tiis for the next two years at the earliet, and this mutizy might spread at any moment, so I longto hear of her being in safety. Iamthanul to say I am in sound health and fit for a campaign, thoUgh i is one I least expeoted, and almost envy hfortimer his high stooL I had ateiSble march last week, ooncluding with a mile and a half in the dry sand of the Ganges in the middle of the day. I never felt anything like it in my life. One maan actuaLy lay dowu and died t the end of it. So much for soldiering." The Nord of Brus el3 pablisBhes the followingletter from Madras from " its own correspondent"- " MA &AS, JuLY 10. "lndia at the present moment, from Cape Comorln to thefoot of the Himalayas, is thetheatre of the mosthorrible crimes and atrocities-offioers murdered by their soldiers, women violated and cut in pieces, and children roas alive before theirparants' eyes. " Such are the scenes now witnessed in Indis, that fis country where, nevertheless, for a century the English have established their rule and laws. " This state of things has roused the East India CompLay's Government from its habitual apathy. The public press has taken hold of the question, and numerous pampblets have been publshed to point out the evil, its causes, and the remedies to be employed. " As it was the army which first gave the example of revolt and crime, it is on its organization that public attention was first directed, and all the orpns of thepressloincide in discovering the evi,- "1. In priority admitted as the only claim to promotion. "2. In the little talent and military taste of the officers of the Indian army. "3, In the total want g sympathy between them anp4 their men. " . In the faulty organization of the military government placed under the control of the civil wervice. " Tho native army, consisting of 73 regiments of 1,000 men each, tolerates patiently, but also contemptuously, its English officers, and from the atatement of its commanding officers,who really took an interest in its orgazaton, t was a secret enemy ef the Indian Government. "A great General often observed that he feared the Sepoys more than an enemy on the frontier. " The army, which consists exclusively of Hindoos and Mussulmans, to whom the use of pork fat Is expreasly forbidden by thelr religion, made a pretext of greased cartridges given to them with a new description of musket, and they rose as one man at every military station. The soldiers first refused obedienoe; they then fired on their officers on parade, and then deserted their colours and their profession for ever. "1 The Government at first triel to persuade itself that it was only an accidental mutiny in,two or thre discontea6k regiments, and the Governor-General issued a proclamation to reassure the troops that other cartridges would be given them, and that the Government would never interere with their religion. The troops received the proclamation with very bad grace, and a few hours after it had been officially read some regiments fired on theirofficers, burned their stations, and put to death all Europeans they met with, without regard to sex or age. "The so-called mutiny assuned the proportions of serious revolution, fomented throughout the whole of India by all the dethroned Kings and deposed Muaslman Princes. " What is the cause of this revolution? Is it to be attrbnted to thegreased cartridges, or solely to discontentamong the Sepoys t "No, it is to be attributed,- "L To the policy of annexation, followed for many yars by the representatives of the Eas India Company. " 2. To the unjust treatment of heL women and heirs of the deposed crowned heads. " 3. To the breach of faith on the part of the Government towards the army on two different occasions. "4. To the humiliation of Europeans in favour of a few privileged classes of natives and Mussulnans which the Government wished to flatter to obtain loans from them. '"5. To the tendency to seze hold of the fortunes of Rajabs and miionaire nabobs. "-6. To a false application of what the Goverment pleased itself to style philanthropy. "7. To the lientiousness of the native press. "Let us now examine eaoh of these causes:- "1L The Government of the East India Company ha aumexed, without any ressoa, and most unjusty, the kingdom of Oude to its territory. This false and clumsy policy aroused the indignation of the whole of that rich and populous country, and the Sepoys, who belong chiefly to Oude and the neighbouring countrles, took up arms for the cause of their King. "A great number of other deposed princes and princesses Are actually receiving pensions from the Company, but, s it always endeavours to find means to reduce its expenditure by pretending that the women and heirs are not legitimate, It has created a general common feeling of discontent among them which has made them the sworn enemies of the Government, and actual events have proved that thoe. Ki}ngs and Prnces are at the head of a portion of the conspiracy which has broken out. The Government has taken advantage of this to shut up the King of Oae1 and his Prime Minister as prisoners in the fort at Calcutta; It will at likewise tovards many other princes now receiving pensions, and will thus save many lacs of rupees. "1 2. A law has been prepared, and is, it is sid, on the eve of being pased, to prevent Rajahs and other TIdia millionaires leaving their property to indirect heirs; thu, the possessor of only 1,000 rupees mayleave themtobhs nephews and nieces, but anyone pos3sesng 10 lace or more pan only leave them to the Hon. East India Company. " This law, if we a to believe the ndiveas, w fnmed with a view to the eventual death of oertan Rajabsrho have no legitimate children, especially to that of the Baja of Burdwan, who possesses millions. This mnewuu It appears, in no manner plesed him, for he is one of th. Individuals compromised in the presant movemet As regards the women, tightly or wrongly, public rmour prevails that the Government put them to death to avoid paying their pensions. A joua speaking of the reit o iaspoore, i las yer that they had bee sentt at,ea lilential residence that the payment might.stop. "s3 The Governmet broke its word towards thesamy It had, in fact. promied to the men tit they hould not ross the sea; now, in the Bumese war it ordered four regiments to embark. The first order ws disobeyed. The troops had 3ight on their aide, yet thy were decimated and fired upon by Egisah cannon. At tbe time of the Sikh war th@e amy reused, at a critica *zd decisive morament, to eross the Sutlej -without s &wa Thj Generals were obliged to give in, and a baaa was grantd. When Ode was annxed the Government, then in strength declared that the bata should ease to be pad These ifcSt; added to the diseontent caused by tie greased cardges, brought about, with the gold of the Pk*as and of tle Kings, the present revolution iu India. r 4. The Company's Governmeat, despito its incredible resources, has alwaya gone beyond its meams, andl has consequently been erompeled to contract loans. Its debts actually amount to 5,000,OOOL sterling. It was necessry to cajole or flattern a oetain rich ca in Inda, and to suceed, under the mask of pailanthropy, native magistrates, judges, and eofcial seoretaries were appointed. These mihna tions only doubled the hatred of the Musulmnan against 'the do,! of a Christian;' and, though making money, the Goversment by no means advanced the welfare of the cou'tAy.

It Is now gnerally known that the paent mausd. pveeting 1s likely to be one of the most succetful that has ever taken plaoe in Worcester. The reaerved seats in the navo of the Cathedral are nearly aU dispoaed of for each of the oratorio vedosanoe on Wednesday, Thursday, and Frday, and the tickets for the evening concerts have been eqeally In demand. The attendance in the church this morn. lug-when full clthedral service was performed-was very arge. About 3,100 persons assembled. The musical part of the service includod the preca and rWnpi4s by Tallis, chants of the same venerable composer to the . Veoit'e and " Jubilate," and one by the BRev. W.

Dr. Elvey conducted his ownauthem. Altogether music played amore important pat in the service tban is always the ease the anthem of Mendelssohn being the chief attraction (if such a terlm may be used with referen(c to An act of worbip), on account nkot only of its beauty and devotional feeing, but of its oomrative novelty. The nthem of Dr. Elvey was very generally admired, and pronounoed by good 3Udgea one of his ablest compositions. Tho sermon of Canon C. F.

THEN ROYAL SURREY GARDBNS COMPANY. Yesterdlay afternoon a meeting of the shareholders In this company~ was held in the Refreshment-hall, Tor the murpos of considering their presnt piositon. The mieetinag was nIumerously attended, but the direotors abstAined from being present. Mr. CooatBx was called to the chair, and in opening the p3roceedings said that the state of their property showed it was in a ruinous condition, and therefore they must wenl dellberate on the mnatter, and not he too hasty in their concluxions. He felt that the petition to the Bankruptcy Court was the petition of the directors to wind up the affairs againat the shs.reholders, and unles it was superseded the shareholders would be ruined. (Hear.) Mfr. FLEasNGu said he hoped that they would excuse him Tar detaining theta, hut lhe wished to give them some informnation relative to their position. (Hear, hear.) The etition was presented by Mr. A. Tones for his brother, Wr. Horace Jones, the architect to the company. He did not mean to say one wrord against those gentlemen lndividuaUy, hut in the position they held with reCoed to the company. The Cormmisoner in Bankruptcy appeared at first to think that this was one of those iDubble companies that had got into bankruptcy, and therefore thought it would b advisable to wind it up bunt when he was informed that the shareholders felt aggrieved he gnted an adjournment till Thursday, wit-h an order to look into the accounts, and he must observe that Mr. El1lis, the secretary, had rendered them every assistance. (Hear, hear.) Binmself and M1r. Coombe bad looked into the accounts on the previous day, and found they were so complicated that it was impossible to come to any conclusion in that time. They looked at the accounts from which the dividend was declared, and there it was that their attentson had been drawn, to the position of their creditors and on looking at the Act it 'was discovered that the directors were liable for any debts if they improperly declared a d3ividend. 1.-Well, then, the aocountathemselvesshowed that when the directors did declare a dividend of 5 per cent. forthe hialf-year they wero not in a solvent position. There were liabilities then outstanding to the extenxt of 9,0001. There were two mortgagee onl the rrty-viz., one fer 9, 5001,, and a second to tce builder o-790lQ1.v Of those sums 2,3001. was.paid to M1r. Coppook =o oney be had advanced to the buidMing accounit. The woeof the 5,5001. was borrowed before the half-yearly mneeting of the company in April last, and yet at that meeting he was told there' were no outstanding liabilities, except those for the currnt expenses, while the company was to al intents and purposs perfectly inslvent. Looking generally at their position, thLere was a clause in the Act 'which allowed them to wind up their own affairs; and he thought it woutld be munch better for thema to wind up their own affairs rather than suLffer the expense and delay of going through the Court of Bankrtptcy He thought that the Commi%sioner would grant them, thi s (bear), and he did not think Mr. Horace Jones would, advisedashewas byarespectable solicitor, stand out against thisopinion, seeing thatit was ainioet the unanimous -wish of the sabgreholders. The effect of doing it themselves would he this-that they might come to terms with the mortgagees, and if it was thorught desirable to carr the gardens on they m ight do so unxder a different management, reducivg so much of the expenses as might he deemed advisable. Thaen he thought the coinliazy might be carried on succesfully, and with remunera. co o l onoerned. (Hear, hear.) Referring to the lease, he expreszed his conviction that the ladlords were anxiousi to assist them in their present painful posi. tion, and in conclusion Mir. Fleming said that he should Idvise them to go before the Comraissiioxer and urge the necessity Of allowing the shareholders to wind up the affairs of thte company, whLich would save an Immense amount of their property. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NIC13OLLr then foll1owed in the same course, and, referring to the late affair withi regard to the benefit for Mrts. Seaco.e, he said he thought their honour was at stake. M. jULlagN (with some animiation,)--That is a robbery. She oughLt to have had her maone every night-that was ageed on. The man who took th at inoney ought to bie brough before you.

(Ches.) .;s Mr. TYR having offered a few rerarks in ixplzaution, The CHAIRmA tthen called the attention ofi-te meeting to their exactpoition. They were there underan fyeari) lease, at a rental of 3461., and taxes about 2M,, and every seven years they had to pay a fine to the province of Canterbury of one-anda-nalf years' viue, which he est"mated would be about 2,00bl. He thought now they had built such magnificent premisea that they should not lose them readily. It was intended evideutly to geb the affair in such a state that it could be brovgbT under the hammer, but that should not be allowed, for the petition of Mr. Jones was only his in name; therefore he should ask for permission, as he knew the facts of the ce,se to give in an amdavit to tha Court of Bankruptcy (hear,hesr) to let them have the power of winding up the concern. (Hear, hear.) 3M. JUTLLn wished to make a few remarks. He wan'ed to know where Mr. Coppock was. Mr. Coppoek could ceme and declare a dividend of 5 per cent., which was wrong because we never had his dividend. But after the Seezole I festival he never came near. He himself had no money this season, except P. part of bis salary in shares at the be- .inng of the seeson. Where was the money gone to? (" Oh, oh I" and "Eear, hear.") Mr. TYLER would say that the money was taken up to his room every night, and in the morning placed against the checks aud sent to the bank, and it was the same in the Seacole week. hI. JULLwXN.-Thls is wrong, for at the end of that week I went with this check (holding it up), and found nothing at the bankers. (Loud cheers and some confusion.) Mr. rE.nMING then moved a resolution to the effect that the gentlemen who were appointed to make ain investigation into the accounts baving made their report, it wis oonsidered necessary to make the strictest inquiry into the affa.irs of the company, and therefore a committee of investigation be formed of shareholders for that purpose, and generally to conduct the affais of the company in Its windmng-up, that the oommittee seek wbat professional assistance they may require, and that an application be made to the Court of Bankruptcy to get rid of that petition. hlr. MAcDoNAI;D having seconded the motion, It was carried unanimously. Several gentlemen having handed in sub3crlotions towards defrayiDg the expenses of the movement,. The CHAmix. said he now rose to do a work of sympathy. However the shareholdezs might thlnk their affairs to have been badly conducted, yet there was one gentlemna who had not only been most anxious in his tndeavours to promote the prosperity of the compauy, but he now was in this position, that, instead of reoeivmk; his'salhiy, the checks which huA been given to him had been: disbonoured at the bank; therefore not only was he deprived of his own money, but he had been placed in a very distressing position by not being able to pay his band. He therefori called on them to give M. Jun3ien a mnost cordia and hearty vote of thanks for the manner in which he had always endeavoued to promote the interests of-the company, expressing.withit, at thesametiae, l4e sympathy of the shareholders with his position. The motion having beepn econded and oarried with aecla. mation, M. JuLLniz rose, and, greatly affected, said he had been very misserably treated for the 15 months that ho had been connected with the company, He had found his 30 sears' experionce had here been tbrown away. The directors had not understood his endeavours, exceptin in the case of Mr. Beale and Mr. Chapel. For the past four or five months he had been very badly situated, for he had had to keep his poorfellows inthe bandforhours for their money, but he could not get his check for 2,0001. through the bad management. Many of those poor fellows, only getting 21. a-week, and having had many tears to leran their profeseion, had to walt for hours before they could get their money to get food for themselves and familes. For himself, he had been calledto the boeomof hIs family to re3t, but he could not; he had commenced with this, and he would sink with it as the last man of a ship should do. (Cheers.) He had many times gone into the orchestra wvhen told by his doctor that he would die, but he said it wouldbe an honourto dieinhis orchestra. (Cheers.) It had been supposed he was rich, but he was not, for he had very heavy - expenses to meet in obtaining now muaic and extending his orchestra. (Hear, hear.) He was a most economical man, for the cost of himself and famiy at home was not 21. a-week. He trsted to God, however, that the concern would next year succeed. He had spent a large fortune in one affair in establishing a national opera, and it bad driven him to the Bankruptcy Court. He said he hoped he should never figure agai in amything cornected with bankruptcy. The usual compliment to the chairma terminated the proceedings.

Hickey was thereupon. taken into cust-ody and lodged in the lock-up. On Mondaylast,as the consftables having the charge of the prisoners in the lock-up were going their rounds, on entering Hickey's cell they found him leaning against the wall and apparently inL a helpgles state, with his head hianging down. On approachinig him It was discoveredl that he was deaad, havig suspended himself by his hiandkerchief from one of the bar of the window of his celL. He was immediately cut down but life was extincot, and it was the opinion of the sureon that hehad been dead at least an hour, The suicide appears to ha.ve been mnost determined in him intention. The her of the window from which he had sus. pended himself was not mare than six feet from! the floor - but,fromn the posibion of the body when, discovered, it woulA seema that Hickey had got upon his bed, and, after adjustinig the handkerchief to the window bar and his neck, had thrown himself down, and thus caused strangulation. when discoverea, his legs were bent under his body.

THE INDIAN ARMY. TO TE EEDIPO.R OF THE TAIMS. Sir,-So much. Ias been lItely aeid in the home papers calculated to impress the public with ^a'ery erronsous and a very utfa ouble veof the reationas ad to exist between the European rgimental offLicers of the Indian anies and their meu that I hope you willpermit an old offioer of one of the three Lidian armie-that of Madras-to say a few words in defonce. The charges mide are That the discipline and the drill of the native soldier and the interior economy of the companies of regiitnta are left in a great measure in the hands of the native officers, and that even the young European offices are taight their duty by natives. That the European officers are' very little acquainted with their men, have -very little personal omnmunication with them, even on duty matters, and that they have none of that pride in their regiments which the regimental officers of Her Majesty's European regiments have; and that, as a general rule, there are no European offcers of long actual continuous regimental service present with corps; and that theclass of "regimental officers," properly so called, does not exist. Leaving the Bengal and Bombay armies toanswer for tbemselves, as a Madras officer, on the part of the Ma4a army, I respectfully deny .ll these imputations. And, first, with respect to the duty supposed to be left to native offlcers So far fromthe work ofcompanies being done by them, tbe trath is that, as a class, they do very little, and the grade exists and is valued niore as a respectable and easy provision for deserving non-commin3ioned officers than for the duties the holders of it perform. The Euro pean officer is not only-the nominal but the ieal commanding officer of the company; he alone can punish, and he alone can promote or can-give any indulgenoe or leave of absence. He alone, too, is responsble for the interior economy of his company, to which iu its most minute details he is expected to give, and usually dots give, his personal attention. Iu proof of what I allege I give a few short extract; from the " Standing Oderds of Native egimntW": - "The captain's respopsibility for his company is undf vided. Re should personally 1mow and attead to every circumstanoe connected with his men, hearing and adjusting their various complaints mad discussions, and, above , invariably executing the duties of his situation in person." " It is the duty of offioers to make themselves acquainted with the name, servioes, and chracter of every mau under their oomnandi- -and notthing evinoes more culpable neglect in an officer than as being obliged to refer for such infor. mation to another person." " Officers will always disbure the - pay in parson to their men, lleAn absent on guard t be jpaid.on being relieved; those sick, at the hospital,"-all xit presence of the Eurzopeanu ofiicr. Oaptains of companies will -visit the sicklin hoei pital at least once a-wFeek, rnd they- will dire their subalterns to do !30-at such times em they think fit." AUl orders of importance "to be explained to the men by the European oflicerjbimself." "All complaints orapplcalons must be pieferred to the European officer, on whom it wilt be incumbent to give hiBs personal attention to heir adjust. meut." Books of oompanie are to be kepin -the handwriting of the captain of the company or of his subaltern. They are, required 'to keep their own roster of privates themselves, detiliong the Individuds for duty." The European adjutant is required to attend the drill of the recrits morning and evening when other daties do not inteffere, and " to inspect all parties for guard or detachment." It is his peculiar province to superintend the dril and instruction of every young officer joining the regiment ;" and when his duties may prevent his doing so, the duty to be done " by an European officer, who will be nominated for the purpose by the commanding officer." As I am afraid to trespass on you with Any more extracts, I wil only further add that commanding offhcers of regiments are zeg,ired to act strictly up to this code of " standig orders."Brigaj3iers commanding stations are ordered to see that all grades do so; and general officers, at their annu,l inspec. tions, are commanded to certify in their confidential reports that they have ascertained that the interior economy of regiments is carried on as dirted by the "f standing orders.' Such being the precautions used to insure obedienoo there cunot be any doubt that they effectually do so; and I hope that I may have succeeded in satisfying you that the Eluropean officers of the Madras army, and not the native ones, are its working company officers, and that the former ought not to be charged with neglect of their duties as xegiinental officers. I repeat, I leave the Bengal and Bombay armies to speak for themselves. It only remains to notice the imputation that there 1i not anyof the olassof old '°regimental offioers" properlf so called belonging to or with native corps-that alt ara I staff men Ths, too, is amistske. There wiUl be founai some old officers in every regiment of from 15 to 30 gear.' standing, besides younger ones, who were never employed on the staff away from their regimental head-quarters; and I firlyr believe that many of the European officers of the Madras army have as strong a feeling of pride in. their corpe and n their men as the officers of any European corps can have. I know that it was so in m case whenIwasaxegimentaloffloer; andIknow that weu I was in adjutant there was sarcely a native in my rdgfmean whose whole history I was not personally acquainted with, and that, when a company officer and a commanding officer, a day seldom passed that some of my men did not pay me a friendly vint in their native drcess to con~sult me about their private affairs But I must admit that the centralization sytemn latterlyintrodooed is calculated to diminish the intercourse between officers and their men, and to impair the indluence and the authority of commanding officers of regiments. - Their hands are being daily more and more tied by codes of rales and regulations, leaving them without dicetionrypowver either to rewvard or to punish Al must be done by "rulb of thumab." In former tlmes a commanding officer oould promote. ths man he thought most deserving, and could get rid of any m3n he thought an incambrance; and he could, by his recom. mendation to Government, obtain additional pension for any very faithful old native officer or soldier. Now all these things are reduced to a fixed scale, and a commsudin3 officer's recommendation would be of no avail whatever. The knowledge that he wasthen confided in by the Govern. ment,and influential, mado a commanding officer to belookeA up to formerly by all the native grades with reverential respect. Ele was considered by them, and called by them, " Mah Baup" (mother and father, protector). Now a different system prevails, out of which a commanding officer has no power so travel in the least degree, and out-of which every private knowis he canot travel; ond the sooner we gO back to the old system the better, for until we do commanding officers wdll not regain that influence over theIr men which they formerly possessed. Ysour obedient servant. AL 2ULI& TO THlE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Cambridge, Aug. 24. Sir,-The great amount of niaormation which your columns have given un, both by the publioation of the remarks of correspondents and in your own leading articles, indtces me to believe that you will afford a space to the following, as illustrative of Sir Charles Naplers opinion and your own remarks in your leading article of to-day. About 30 years ago I oopied it from a minute by the late Sir John Malcolm, a statesman and a soldier of high repubation, employed in and well acquainted with the three presdencies of India, as well in their civil as military elations:- ' The officers of the Bombay army hive generall considered it beneficial to have a mixture of castes in their regiments, and among others a portion of Hindoslanu mea, not exceeding 200 per battalion; but they consider these as only indispensable when their own provinces cannot recruit their ranks. They consider the EHidostan men, though ia size and appearance, and perhaps in a certain degree of military plide, zuperior to thtir own, to excel them in nothing else. The Konkunees and Dulchunees they account more patient under privation and fatigue, snore easily subsisted and managed and in bravery to be fully their equals. They are the descendants of Sevujee's 'M£ountain Rats,' whom neither the stature nor military bearing of the Hin370stauee could debar from advaucneln¶to fhe gates of Delhi; and, the early history of the Borny army shows them to be nlo way degenerated from the spirit cf their anxcestors." I may here take the opportunity to add that their services In Scinde, Meoltan, GoojerAt, ~ad Persia have borne out this haracter to the present time. Sir John Mlcolm goe oi to say,-I haye perus*v` attentively the records of the'Bombay native army before they bad any Mnen from Hliiidosta, and iojgli- the severestriais they hve evti4ed a eouro4e ffdelity, anid temper under danDer, privation, nd fatie wbich we' cannt expect to iea exceededL Til ii ho a- 12 yewar the general sentitent amogg thleao. n w *as the pride of corpe.

An9oldsoobadar (a native captain) who had served ih both armies, observed to me, Tliihdostan Zat ke Ghyrat ; Bombay Pultan ke Ghyrat :, In Hmidosta -(the Bengal army) it Is the pride of caste, in EqmbJy the pride of corps. "Almost all the principal revenue servants are l3rsahmis, and they are a valuable ola of men. Every attention is due to the special observances of their caEte and relgion; btt when, as frequently happens, they soLdit their European superiors to clssify Sepoys, and to plae sentries In a Maner that will prevent the inconvenienceof Itheir wash ing, &o., they should be told that the soldier is ennobled by his occupation, alnd that they might leave the public service if the proximity of any of those employed in l# was insufferable. " This feeling, when indulged, increasez and creates the worst of spirit among the men of the corps, as well as hatrAd in Sepoys to be employed under or have any commu#ioation with native servants in the cvlv; branch. They coinplain, and very justly, that the treatment they receive froah 'theta s often different from that they receive from their officers "'The gowardly fellows of Brahmina,' id an ablo and ole Kenkunee soobadar I was eonversing with on"th point ' who wouldnot look at me, and would degrade a brave inan of my,cast (a Purwaree) by refusing to let him stand seitzyoverifeireare, if in a cutchery a colleckor'e office), would orings 0ditpl p.collector to hisshoe if it fell off, and would ooxilder tbebnseliae tho more honoured the nearer they sat to him;-And yet I believe,' said the old man, laughing, 'you Feringeea (Faks in some languages) are, according to their belief, as unclean and impure ex we Pux. warces.' "Manyrespewtable natives-Poorwa,the DIwa- of lywre, among the rest-swured me that no objection should be tolerated on this score against any soldier; that the doing s,0 would be dangerous to aay Governmext. "'The pride of casto must notbe gratified at the hazard of any part of tho temper or respectability of that army to w.hih the safety of the empire has been and must continne to be entrusted." It clearly shows his opinion as to thoeconstitution of the Anglo-Indian army and the treatment of the different c%stew -diametrically oppo4ed to the plan of SirkH J. Somerset ; and no person can do4bt as to which of these generabhad -the best opportunity of formiig a correqt judgment. It is not, perhaps, to be e;pe4ed that. any officers of the Royal army can all at once become acquainWd wath .11 the peon. liarlties of the lndian army; bnt the same qxcuse will not apply to the present Adjutant-General of the Bombay army, at whose ipistigation, report says-truly or notk cannot say -the order wasi ased.

FUENITRS DIONORO. TO TB:E EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Bir,-No officer who was present at the battle of Faentes d'Onoro can have read the staten ents of Ceptain Brialmont, and of the authoiitie4whom ke quotes, as published in 2Pie !Za of the 21it; without the utmost istonishment, Not only was no battalion either of the I,ight Division or of the Guards on that day broken or sabred by French Dragoons, but, so far as the Guards are ooncerned, no French Dragoon ever approached within 200 yards of their forma tion. There were serving in the Dcke of Wellington'a army a- that time only two battalions of Guards-one of the Cold. 5treams, and one of the Fusdliers-not three, whom General Pelet so unmercifaUy sabres, as stated by Captaln krialmont. So far, however, from these two battalions having been sabred on that day, they were never even threatened, and never fired a shot. Being the only surviving officer of that portion of the British army -which alone was really charged and sabred by the Frch Dragoons, and which, in fact, consitutes the Lole foundation upon which all these pretended chargings of squares and sabrings really rest, I feel myself called upon, both by Sir William Napier and by Captain Brialmont, to narrate what actually took place under my own eyes-in which I was a principal actor, and upon which really unimportant event these French genorals, and marshals have contrived to raise such a superstructure of absurdity and falsehoods. On the night of the 4th of May 100 men-namely, 50 from the ColdstreaBs and 50 from the FusUlers-wvith four subaltern officers, of whom I was the senior, were detached under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, fo act as picket4 to watch and guard the rocLy ravine through which rar a small stream called Das Casas This ravine ran north aind south, and was parallel to our nain position, at about half a mile's distance from it. The pickets remained rundisturbed during the night, but early on the morning of the 5th Lord Aylmer came down and told us that, as the French were moving to their left to turn the ravine, we should probably be attaoked on that side, we had better change our positlon, and occapy the ground with our left to the ravine and onr right to the m siu position-that we were t act,as light troops, and only fall back if severely pushed by the enemy. There was no reserve either of cavalry or infantry upon which we could fall baok and rally, and not a word was said about cavalry being likely to attack us. In faet, all these preliminary arrangemen-ts were directed against the probable attacks to be made by the enemny's light troops alone. This attack of their light infantry soon afterwards took place, and we were driving them rapidly back, when all at once a large body of French Dragoons, ascertained afterwards to consist of the 7th and 13th Chassenrs, appeared upon the crest of a ridge, about 100 yards distant, which had entirely concealed this movement from our observatioa. On the top of the ridge they halted for half a minute, Probably to allow the tear squarons to close np, as also to look at our force and position. Neither of these were favourable to us, or to the receiving a charge from favalry. Our men were scattered at a distance from one another; they were from the battalion companies, and we had no bngler, even it they could have understood the call to assemble and close. I employed the half minute before the charge in getting the fewv men to whom my voice reached together, and desired them to cease firing, and wait until the enemy were close upon us before they gave their voll,y I had thus got some 18 or 20 men together, when Iper ceived the enemy preparing to chre. Iturned round to communicate this to Colonel HGIl, with whom I had been cOnversiDg a moinent before, when to my surprice I saw him rapidly retreating to the rear, leaving me in command, to do the best I ceuld. T!here vas no posibility of following the example thus set by our commanding officer, and we consequently stood where we were to receive the attack. The Dragoons came on, at first at a slow trot, then at a gallop, stooping over their horses' necks, so that hardly anything was seen bu,t the horws itself. When close upon us we gave them one volley, and then received such as actually charged upon our bayonets. These, hovwever, were but few in number, for one volley, or the expectation of it, had caused the enemy to swerve to the right and left, so that none of my small party were actually ridden over. Some, however, of the Dragoons did pawt through, and my small body of gallant soldiers were I no doubt, completely broken. Many of them, however. escaped by pasing round and in the rear of the snuadrons who had charged them, and thus sgain rejoined their battalion. I would ha ve done the same, but as the officer comnmanding I was thought a better prize, and was iZmediately surrounded, and was thus left alone on the field encompassed on all aides by hostile forces andnaked sabres. Our nime. nders on the hill, perceiving the state of affairs, and ,e7dispersion of the pickets, were immediately run out, and discharged repeated volleys of grape into the body of cavairy, killing and wounding many of their men and horses, and throwing them into great confusion. Perceiving this confusion, I immediately wrested myself out of the hands of those who had old of me, and, forcing my way through the others, I made my escape, though followed by some Dragoons, and rejoined my reginent. While these things were passing, Colonel Hill had been pursued, wounded in the face, and carried off a prisoner, along with several of those men, some 14 or 15, who had followed his ezample, Of those who remained with me I do not believe that one was taken. Sach, Sir, are the true facts, upon which alone all these charges and breaking of squares and sabrings of the light and firstdivision are founded. Out of this molehill have General Pelet, Marshal Bessieres, AL Thiers, and the other Mersons quoted by Captai Brialmont in your paper of the inst. contrived to raiEe the mountain of absurdity and falsehood therein set forth. If Captain Brialmont has quoted his authorities correctly, of which I am somewhat doubtful, I asm of opinion that they will not add to the honour or reputation of the superior officers of the French army of that time for candour and truth. That Captain Brialmont himself believes them to be true I have no doubt; but courteous and honourable as he is I cannot fancy such a man to be a competent writer of a military history and the life of the Duke of Wellington. I am, Sir, your very hurmble servant. -F. HOMw-. late I3eutenant-Colonel, Fnsileer Guards. Aug 25. TO THE EDITOR OF THE IM S..

THX INDIAN HUTZINIS. MRSETMG AT THE MAXSION-HOCUSE. Yesterday afternoon, In compliance with the suggesetIn cf many infnaeetial gentlemen, the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor convened a public meeting of the merchant6, cilat}, and others in the Egyptian-hall for the purpoee of devising means for affording immediate relief to those who are now suffering from the effects of the ravages committed by the mutineers in India. The meeting vas coaveued for 2 o'clook, and shortly after that hour the Lord Mayor, acompamied by the Lady MLayoress and several gntlemer, who took part in the prooeedings of the day, entered tbt hall. Probably ewing to the excessve heat of the atmosphere, the bdy ofthe hall, in which were plaoed the seats for.the public, was by no means crowded, and the majority of those present were ladies. His Lordship took the Xhalr and among those present on the platform were Lord IDiisif can, Admiral Sir Stephen Lushington, Sir MgeeU Nontefiore; Alderman BoseI, Colonel Henderson, Captain Lysch the Rev. Canon Champneye, Mr; Juskiee HaUburo Mr. Lefchild, Colonel Holland, Captain TitchbourneI M G. Hitchcock, General Tulioch, C.B, Mr. W. Dent, 3f B. X. R. Campbell, &c.

He ould not better explain the prcise nature of the objects they were met to advance than by reading an -ex. tract from a letter which had been waitten by a meniber of the eminent firm of Gordon, Stewart and Co., of 4l. cutta, dated the 4th of July, 1857- LIxseat Ay wromen andchilorso, many widows and e,tP,1ksa and many ntterlY dedtitute. havng lost everytubg. are anIviog in actta UA few of us were doing owr beat to help thtem, #ben it was suggested tu weshould niske our little cbheme known.

' me«leeD He saw yesterday a gentleman who had just arrived from ] India, and who stated that just before his departure a committee had been formed fom the immediate relief of the man laies and faniliss of al classes known to be crowded in the different river steamers then on their way to Calcutta for refuge; nearly all were utterly destitute, without clothing or means of common supporI The GovernorGeneral had subscribed ]O,OOQ rupees (hear, hear), and Lady Canning 2,;0, and a committee was formed for collecting a general subscrlption. The comditte had already,in -h - antcipation of furtber support and sympathy, and acting on their own responsibility, at once engaged commodious houses, furnishing them with the required absolute necep-' sairies for thereception and maintenanoe of the unhapy sufferers, thereby entailing heavy linbilities, and depend vg on the forthmcomiog ample contributions of the pubaic a large for reimbursement and support. (Elear, hear.) The meeting might wish to know who were the clsses who had been tea principal sufferers in British India. It was scely possible to be suLpposed that in a place like Indio so many persons could have been thrown into such a state of destitution as had been described. There were many classes in that country who were little known in England livng in comfort and compartive affluence on the branches of the rivers and at the outposts. Those clases formed the mass of the sufferers on whose behalf the presenit appeal was made. They were the wives vwidows, and children of public emsploy and military offcers who have been driven from their homes by the mutineers, who have escaped froma the many stations on the river, and from the mlitary outposts and civil stations within an area of some hundred miles of AUlahabad and Cawnpore, Many of these ladies and families had to escape at a momaent rning, leavig their husbads, if yet alive, in the dangerous performance of their official and pablic duty. In addition to this class were the families of the several misona and educational establishments. There were the families, also, of a vast number of European and Eas. Indian clerks and assistants in offices, public and prlvate, at these different stations. These, from their limited means and less inaluen. tial position, had, it was feared, greater diffieulty in efect. =ng their escape, and were without clothes, and deprived of adl means of present maintenance. Among the rugeis also must be tho families of many Europear tradesI people and shopkeepers who were located at the different up-country stations, and 'who have been plundered of thei- aL The upper indigo factories muast have added many to the list of destitute fugitives. The families of E3uropean sergeants and pensioners, scattered over the outposts and various stations, with the escaped woomen and ehildren of the European soldiery, must have largely increased the number. It was trae that the local Government of India was called upon to support many of these classe, whfle the public widow and orphan institutions will have eventually to maintain the sufferers in many cases Already it is said that the first month of the mutinous outbreakhd consigned no less than,30 widows of officers to the number of pensioners on the already overburdened Bengal militay faund But there mnst be hosts of sufferers whose cases no public or official benevolence, however sctive and well digpostd, as they knew it to be, could eftectuaUy and practicslly maeet in the first prostration and ruin of the vctims. It is true also many families and individuals would in time come upon the relief afforded by the mornthly pay and sslaries and claims for compensation due to the husbands and parties in public employ who had not leen strck down and murdered by the rebels Bot a Government, even in a calamity like this, must be guided greatly by the rules of an organized public service, and cannot be supposed at once to be able to meet the urgent and pressing wants of helpless individuals and families. It was only by private benevolence and the personal Indefatigable exertions of local meetings and committees that such cmes could be promntly looled into and adequately relieved, It had been said tat the Government of India ought to protect and compensate the whole of these sufferers for theit losses. (Hear, hear.) It was perfectly true that the Go. vemment were bound to compensate the classes of this de. soription, but they could not reach all individual cases. The public widow and orphan institutions-and there vere some splendid institutions of that kind in India-would have to maintain many of these sufferers during the first rush of the mautinous oatbreak There bad been assigned to the care of the widow and orphan institutions during the first month of the outbreak no less than 30 offioers' ridows. He happened to be the agent of that fund, and knew that 30 widows had been tbrown upon it. It had been sad that the Goveri.- ment should contribute to the relief of -thee suff ersbut there 'were but too many wrhom no pubElc aid o , ;9ffec tually reach.

HEALTH OF LOYDOGI. (From the Registrar-General's Weekly Rcturn.) The deaths registered in London, which in the last week of July rose to 1,238, and in the first and second weeks of August were respectively 1,224 and 1,187, exhibit a very decided deerease in the week that ended last Saturday (August 22d), the number being 1,091. The heavy thunderstorms and rains of the preceding week have doabtless been powerful agents in producing this resolt. It can also be shown that the deaths of last week were rather less than the number which the average rate of mortality in corresponding weeks of 10 years (1847-56) wvonld have produced, if, for better comparison, the deaths from cholera in two epidemio years are excluded from the calculation. Sineo the last week of July there has been a constant decrease in the deaths from diarrheu^. In the week referred to they were 302; thereafter they were successivey 258, 244, and (in the present return) 215. In the samne periods the numbers returned as caused by cholera (in most in stances "'cholera infantam" and " choleraie diarrbcea") were 24, 30, 21, and 12. Eight deaths from diarrho3a (in. eluding cholera) occurred last week in the sub district of St. John, Westminster, 7 in that of St. Margaret, Westminster, 5 in in Brompton, 5 in the Hackney sub-district, 5 in Goodman's fields, 5 ia Bow, 5 in Trinity, Newington, 5 in Lambeth Church sub-district (2d part), and 5 in Plumstead. Sarlatina exhibits an increase, for the deaths from it, which were in the two previous weeks 32 and 16, rose last week to 40. It appears to hare prevailed chie'ly in the north and east districts, for more than half of the fatal cases occured in these two divisions. The registrar of Somers-town records the deaths of three childs-en from "scarlatina anginosa," all within four days, in a family at 8, Johnson-street. The parents, a fourth child, three lodgers in the same house, and a person who was sent to the Fever Hospital, have all suffered from the disease. Typhus and common fever were fatal in 41 cases, meales in 13, smallpox in 4. Three persons died of disease the effect of intemperance 13 children from want of breastmilk. The deaths of fire nonagenarians are returned: one at the age of 90 years, two at- 93, one at 94 in Wild-street, St. Giles, and one at 98 at Putney. With one exception (a man, who was the youngest of the five) these old persons were all widows. Last week the births of 860 boys and 832 girls,-in all 1,692 children,-were registered in London. In the 10 corrmsponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average mumber wvas 1,460. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-887 incbes The highest reading occued on Wednesday, and was 30 inches. The mean temperature of the week was 6581 dog., which is 42 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The hlghest temperature occurred on Sunday (the 16th), and was 83 deg. Tha lowest vwas 51-7 deg. on Tuesday. The range of the week was 313 deg. The temperature rose towards the end of the week, and on Saturday the mean was about 9 deg. above the averago. The wind blew almost constantly from the corth-eaet, till the end of the week, when it changed to east. The mean dew-point temperature was 57,3 deg., and the differeuce between this and the mean temperature of the air was 7-8 deg. The mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 67-5 deg. Rain fell to the amount of 0-32 inches, nearly all of which fell early in the morning of Sunday.
MuTnAL BENEFrT SoCrErs.-The foniteusrpub. lishes a report from the superior commission of surveillance on the situation of these societies since the promul,gation of the decreo of the 26th of MArch, 1852, by which fresh regulations were made for their management, but the adoption of whfoh was optional to such of these societies as then existed. The report makes a distinction between the two kinds of societies denominated respectively private and approved by the Government. The number of societies of both kinds amounted In 1852 to 2,43i ; 1&53 to 2,773; 1854 to 2,Y40; 1855 to 3,123; and ia 1856 to 3,404 The number of members on the 31st of December, 1852, was 271,077, of whom 21,635 were honorary ; in 1853, 318,256 M8,8i0 honorary); 1854, 31,101 (35,300) honorary); 1855, e86,662 (41,434 honorary); ard i 1856, 426,453 (47,281 honorary). The capital in reserve amounted in 1852 to 10,714,877f. ; 1853, 12,089,561f.; 18.54, 13,332,073f.; 185, 14,978,105f. ; and 1856, 16,532.311f. Taking the scieties approved by the Government separately the report states that they have increased frocr 50 in 1852 to 439 in 18.53; 787 iu 1854; 1,063 in 1855; and 1,406 in 1856. The number of members, which on the 31st of December, 1852, was 11,794, increased to 66.646 in 18.53; 104,033 in 1854; 128,576 In 1855; and 167,568 in 1856. The reserve capital progressively increased from 728,318f. in 1852 to 5,803,335f. m 1856. The total number of societies of both kinds has increased 40 per cent, in the five years; the number of the members 57 per cent. ; and the amount of capital 54 per cent. The number of societies approved is 28 times greater than at the end of 1832; the participating members, 13 times; the honorary ones, 15 times; and the reserve capital, 8 times. From these figures, says the report, it wiU be seen that the progress of the mutual benefit societies has never been checked either by the dearness of provisions, the war, or the cholera. The societies approved by the Government bave obtained the greater part in the increase above tnentioned, as their number has nagmented both by the establishment of new ones and by the adjunction of various old ones who revised their statutes in conformity with the decree of the 26th of March. The report, in alluding to the introduction of honorary members, which class was scarcely known in the old societies, states that the incsease In their number shows at once a better feeling and a closer connexion between the rich and poorer classes of society. The report then dwells on the great advantages which have resulted from perrmitting women to become members of these societies, the Aunmber having gone on gradnsUy increasing front 26,181 in 1852 to 47,982 in 1856. The difficulties which were at first experienced in introducing the system of mutual benefit societies into the rural districts have beert gradually surmounted, and one department-that of the Jura-is mentioned as a proof of the trinmph obtained over long-existing preJudices. That department now possesses more societies thin any other in Frence, the number being 216, The report then goes on to state the moral and charitable progress of those societies and the advantages they procure to the members, -namely, the patronage of the childrea of the members by the sooiety itself; schools opened for their fducation; recompenses given for exactitude and industry; Sisters ef Charity placed at the bedside of the sick; linen supplied to the poorer members; library open to aU; and tbe adoption of orphans and assistance to widows. The xeport then alludes to the creation of fonds de retraites,-a question which during the last five year. had formed the subject of serious consideration on the part of the directors of the different societies, According to the modeadovted for carrying this Idea Into execttion, a special acconnt Is opened by the Caisse des Depofis et Consignations in the name of each society, who pay in what sals they can without inconvenience take from their annual reserve. The revenue arising from this fund is distributed in 'he form of life annuities among the aged persons designated by the general meeting, and at their deaths the aunuities levert thoe society. The sum of 500.0001. granted among all the societies on the occasion of the birth of the Prince Imperial formed the groundwork of this fund, and it has been since followed up with the greatest advantage. The report is followed by a long list of recompenses granted to di=ferent persons for their exertions in promoting the establishment of benefit socities. Baron de St. Vincent Judge of the Imperial Court of Nancy, and M Richard, member of the 8ociety of the M1ontagne Ste. Genevieve, have been named K3nights of tshe Legion of aenour, and gold medals bave been? accorded to 20, slilver to 35, bronze to 77, and hsononrable mention to; 27, all mzembers of different bnenefit secieties in Pans and the departments.

WilE MURDER Is THE quBEEs ParSOy. Mr. W. Payne, the coroner for the borough of South. wark, yesterday held en inquest in the Qaeen's Prisont upon the body of Robert Hlenderson Robertson, who died in that prison in consequence of iDjriaes inkflcted upon bimn by an Italian named Antonio de Salvi with a digger knife, under very peculiar circum,tauces. Mr. ?'Mahou the barrister, was pre,enrt to watch the wroceedings on 6ebalf of De Salvi. Mr. Sleigh and Hz. B. owley were present on behal of ar.S. J. Gower, whose name was mentioned in cor,nexion witih the proceedings; and MIr. Crawford, irons the offlce of htr. Wontner, the solicitior, w7as present on behalf of the family of the deceased. The matter which was the subject of inquiry has been so frequently before the public that it will be unnecessaryto do more inthe outset than to state thatthedeceased was oonfined in the Queen's Prison at the suit of De Salvi and Mr. Gower, and that on the Sth of July they both weent to the Qaeen'a Prison, acoompanied by a solicitor narmed Thomson, for the purpose ot endeavonriang to effect some nrrangement'with the deceased relative to the payment of the debt. It appeared that the deceased was disinclined to make any such arrangement, and denied t'.at he owed the money, and the consequence was that De Salvi became fearfully excited and suddenly drew a dagger-knife and stabbed the deceased in the face, and the teumples, and the nape of the neck, the blade of the knife breaking in the last men. tioned wound. The injuries were from the firAs felt to be so dangerous that it was known the deceased could not sarvive, but he liagered until Saturday last, when he expired. Upon the supposition that Mr. Gower hAd made use of some expression of encouragement to De Salvi, they were both committed upon the charge of wounding with intent to murder; but the grand jury ignored the bill a st Mr. Gower, who had been admitt to bai and Dowasvi wa tried and convicted on Friday last at the Central Criminal Court, upon a minor count in the in. dictment, of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude. Mr. Sleigh, at the commencement of the proceedinRs, saiid he thought it right to state that Mr. Gower would have been present, bus that in consequence of the state of his hWtltn arlsing from the anxiety he had undergone, he had ound it absolutely necessary to go into the country; but he had been telegraphed for that morning, ard he would very probably be in attendanee before the Close of the ing hwasmost anxious to answer any questions tne mightthink fit to put to him in ,refrneth efrenca to the Mr. Wakem, the surgeon of the prison, waa then called as a witness. He stated, in addition to the testimony that has previously appeared, that the decea'ed died on Saturday evening, and on the following morning he made a post ?loHtem examination. He said that all the wounds this un. fortunate man had received had entirely healed externally, and he only cnsidered it necessary to make a minute examination of the one at the nape of the neck, in which he had always believed the broken portion of the knife still remained. lHe ascertained that the spinal cord had been dvided, and discovered about two inches of the pointed portion of the blade of a knife imbedded in one of the vertebrse whichb had entered to such an extent as to require consioerable force to remove it. The cause of death was paralysis produced by the division of the spinal cord and the consequent exhaustion that followed upon an injury of this description. Mr. Wakem produced the portion of the spine that he had removed, preserved in spirits, And with the broken blade of the knife still remaining in the place where he disoDvered it. The point of the knife was subsequently removed and compared with the weapon that was picked up at the timie of the occurrence, and they were found to correspond exactly. Mr. Alexander Robertson, the son of the deceased, a young man, was then examined. He was a great deal affected while giving his evidence. He said,-I reside at No. 24. Berkeley-square. The deceased was my father. He did not follow any profession. Ris name was Robert Henderson Robertson. He was 49 years old. I saw him last week, and he told me then that he did not think he should recover, but he made no statement relative to this Affiair. Thomas Buchanan, a police-sergeant, produoed the broken knife, and he stated that he had made inquiries at most of the cutlers in the metropolis, but could not disoover where it bad been purchased. The persona to whom he had shown it, he said, were of opinion that it was a foreign manufactured knife, and that it had been made either in France or Germany. Mr. llead, one of the principal clerks at the Central Crininal Court, produced the deposition of the deceased taken by Mr. Combo, the ma_istrate, in the prison, in the presenoe of De Saln and Gower, and which has already appeared. The material portions of it consisted of the allega tion that he had never seen Gower before the day in question, and that De Salvi had on previous ocoasions threatened his life, and while he was making the attack uporn him Gower called out " Give it the villdn," and wished him to persevere in his violence. In answer to a question put to him, Mr. Road stated that theBrand iury ignoredthe bill against Gower. t r. h iesard Thomson, the solicitor who accompanied the paries to the prison on the day in question was then examined, and he repeated the evidence given by sim on the former occasion. He said that there was first ana altercation between Mr. Gower and the deceased about the debt, and the latter said that, as to 2001. of the money, he had never received it. De Salvi then said, " I let you have the money." The deceased again stated that he did not have it, and De Salvi appeared to be very angry and got closer to him, and at tB time he said Mr. Gower was standing four or five feet oit Do Salvi suddenly placed his left hand on the deceased's right shoulder, and almost at the same Inutnt appeared to strike him in the face, as he thought with his fist, but immediately afterwards he observe1 that we vas bleeding, and he fell from his chair, and De Salvi then struck him in the back and ran out of the room. He then observed that Mr. Gower Wad also gone out of the room, and he went up to the deceased and rendered him what assistance he could. The witness also stated that he did not see any weapon in Do Balvi's hand, and that Gower, to his recollection, did not say a word while the transaction was taking place, Mr. C. E. F. Wylde, a gentleman at present "residing," as he stated, in the Queen's Prison, deposed that upon hearing the alarm of murder on tho day in question he went into the deceased's room, and he beard him exclaim, "I am dying; take down quickly what I have to say." Witness at once procured some writing paper, and at the request of the deceased he wrote as follo ws :-" Send for Mr. Henderson, 7, Mincing-lane, by express, and for Mr. Venning, 9, Tokenhouse-yard Send for the first medical mnan yu can got. Mr. W. Bell, another inmnate of the prison, deposed that he saw De SalI run out of the deceased's room, followved b Gower, and that the latter made a stop and exclaimed Oh I" and at the same time appeared to shudder. Idr. Mnser, another prisoner, repeated the evidence he gave at the Central Criminal Court, which was to the effect that ashort time before the 8th of July he was in the deceased's room with him and De Salvi, and the latter said In a very menacing tone that he wanted to have some private oonversation with the deceased, and the latter motioned him not to go, and he remained. There was then some conversation between De Salvi and deceased upon the subjeot of the debt due to the former and Mr. Gower; and he said that if the deceased did not make some arrangement to ps them he would have his life. The witness stated in addition that after the affair had taken place, on the 8th of July, be went into the deceased's room and the deceased said to him, "I have not maany minutes to live; I have been stabbed by De Salvi several times. Gower was more to blame than he, because he incited him; take care he does not escape." The witness made the observation to him, "' What of Mr. Thomson ? " and the deceased replied, " He remained stll in the room and said nothing." Mr. Colwell, the principal turnkey of the prison, depcesed that when he saw MIr. Gower after the occurrence he appeared quito horror-stricken, and seemed to be looking for assstance. De Salvi wanted to speak to him, but fr. Cower said to him, "Don't speak to me, you vill.in; oh God, that I should have come to this place with such a In answer to questions put by Mr. M'Mahon, the witness sid that while the deceased was quite aware that he could not survive the injuries he had yeceived, he told him the nature of the evidence that had been given by the witness Manser before the magistrate, and he smiled and said that De avi had never threatened him to his face, and be was only afraid of him on account of the threats he had uttered towards him outside the prison. Dennis, one of the turkeys of the gaol, deposed that he took charge of Do Salvi, and told him that be was accused of stbbing Mr. Robertson, and he replied that it was trao, He was then told that Mr. Gower was charged with inciting him to do the act, snd he replied that he knew nothmg about it. He after this tried several times to speak to Mr. Gower, but the latter would not allow him to do , repeatedly said that he was a villain and a mur- This brought the evidence to a close, and several of the Jury said they were of opinion that it would be unnecessary for the coroner to trouble himself with any observations in reference to Mr. Cower, as they were of opinion that he had nothing to do with the act committed by the other man De The COxOsNZR, in sumiling up, said he should call their attention to all the facts in the case, and they would then form their own conclusions. With regard to De Salvl, he said it appeared to him it would be iaupossible for them, if they believed the evidence, to return any other verdict than one of Wilful murder. There was no provocation of any kind that in law would reduce the crime to maslasughter, fior if a blOw had been struck, which was not even suggested that would not have justified tho use of a deadly weapon. As to Mr. Gower, he could onlh be implicated in the matter by what was termed in law being a principhl in the second degree, by aiding and inciting to the commission of the offence; and to make that out they must be satsfied that he knewwhat De Salvi was doing, and that he was aware be was malkng use of a deadly weapon. It appeared to him that there was little or no evidence to warrant such ap assumption; and he reminded them that Mr. Thompson, who was present all the time, stated that he never saw any weapon in the haad of De Salvi, and he imagined that he was srking the deceased with his fist until he saw him bleedinig. The jury almost immediately returned a verdict of " Wilful murder " against Antonio de Salvi only.

THEX GOYBAMENT OFpICaS. TO TEE EDITQR OF. THE TXT BS. Sir,-I feary2u .wi be getting tired of architects and thdr(rea or supposed) grievances; but, r. the two letters yo- have so kindly admitted seem o suggest (though I am sure Mintentionally) an unjust comparison between the designs of their writers and those of some of their competi' tors, and as that comparison involves a question of the greatest practical importance to the success of the entire project, I will, though moat Unwillingly, crave your further forbearanoe. The claim of Messrs. Coe and Holand to be heard was founded on their being the winners of one of the first prizes; that of Messrs. Banks and Barry on belng next in sucession m mine Is fouAded on the fact that my design bh beea placed by the judges at the head of those which were founded upon a developmeut of our medieval a&chi. tecture, and, whichk is morete thepresent purpose, of those which treated the two off&ces first to be erected as esaen. tially a single and indivisible group. It ik to this latter subjeot to which I beg to call your attention, not from any wish to push my own claims, for the authors of nearly all the best design took the same view; but because I think it a moet essential elenment to the suocess of the project. The framers cf the programme, wishing, no doubt, to offer every Incentive to competition, fell into the verrun. fortunate error of offeing separate premiums for the designs for the Foreign and War offices, though proposed to be erected on a single plot of ground, and that but one-fourth of the entire site ; thus rising the ruin of this grand architectural scaeme by dividing ;t into lnconnected blocks, ach but an eighth of the whole. Every one (yourself, I think, included) who criticized the programme protested against this; but, as it was not made an absolute rule, it ew hoped thet the judges -would corect it by selecting for executioa the designs of some one architeot, thus insur ing the fst two instalments of the great project being portions of one harmonious and artistically conceived group. Many arohitects, thinking the success of this magnifioent scheme of more importanCe than their personal success, ventured so to combine their designs as to form a single and indivsible group. Such is the case with all of the four leadinggothic designs, and with several otbers to which pre. minuus have been awarded; but, strange to say, the judges, instead of correcting the error of the programme, deliberately stereotyped it, and made it a rule that such designs as were thus united were ipso facto rendered unfit for execution, and their merits only worthy of being aoknow. ledged by the minor prizes I Instead of this It is mawifest that the very reverse was in reality the case, and that those only were worthy of execution wbich treated the whole as essentially a single group, and the merits of others just such as should be rewarded by the lower primes. Now, what was the objeot for whioh tis vest competiltion was set on foot I Was it merely a grand architectmial curriculum in whioh erain prizes to the amount of 5,OGOO were to be awarded, and architects induced to spend some 5O,OOO. for the please of seeing in what order a few of their names might be placed by the judges ? Surely not. It was to carry out a magnificent project for at once beautifying the neighbourhood of the Houses of Parliament and supplying a great public necessity, and, such being the case, can it for a momaent be doubted that, ccrtis paribus thoee designs were best which added to good angement and good architecture the best grouping toget'her of the two offioes frst to be erected, thus malding a good commencement of the magnicent group eventually contemplated ? i wil only add that adherence to the requirements of the programme is by no means peculiar to your two correspondents, being comnon to al those to whom premiums have been awarded; and that, whether others may or may not joiu me in applanding the opinion ao candidly expressed by Mr. Tite, that no man of taste would wish to plae a renaissance (and a forliori a claceic structure in proximity to House of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, I think all will agree that, had mhilarity to the existing Tresury buildings beeu oonsidered desirable, it would have been hardly worth while to invite a European and world-wide competition. I think it right, too, to stte that the style which I and thoae who think with me have attempted to vindicate has not only the olaima of local association in its favour, but may be proved to ba decidedly less costly thau that of the designs which have received most favour from I the judges. J I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servart. GEO. GILBERT SCOTT. Aug. 24.
THE BRITIsH mUSEUM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of to-day a correspondent who wAteA under the Initials of "J. 0. B." states that on Wednesday ast he Asitea the British Museum, and, after having beeni informed the public were not admitted to the library, "with the interchauge of a masonio kind of look was immediately passed." That he " then tendered 6& in silver, which was accepted as a matter of course." This Is a serious charge, and places all the servants employed at the entrance of the British Museum under $he sus. picion of having been guilty of a double disobedience of orders. May I beg, therefore, through the medium of your journal to request that "J. G. B." will do me the favour to call upon me and point out the person with whom he ex. changed the " masonic kind of look," and who accepted his 6d. " as a matter of course." Your eorrespondent may rest aamred that gratuities are not aocepted by the attendants of the British Museum as " matters of course." The ordersof the trustees in this respect e very positive, and are strictly enforced. It is due, therefore, to these who do their duty that " J. a. B." should asslst the authorities in detecting the person who, It would appear from "J. C. B.'B" state. ment, allows himself to be bribed. I have the honour to be, Sir, your obediant ssrvskT- J.

DrsrTRucT'oN OF A STEAmXB ON LAxT SimcoE.- We regret to state that the fne steamer J. C. Morrxon, the pride and ornament of Lake Simcoe, was burnt to the water's edge wbile lying at her wharf at Barrie at an early hour yesterday morning. Our readers are aware that tbis mnanificent boat has been plying on Lake Simcoe in conenson with the Northern Railroad Company, who were her proprietors. She afforded excursionists an opportunity of exploring the unrivalled scenery of ihis beautiful lake. Her accommodatione were unsurpassed, her fittings ana decorations gorgeous, and altogether she was one of the finest and fastest boats on the waters of Upper Canada. On Taes day evening she returned from her usual trip from BelI Ewart, and was moored at her wharf at Barrio at abouthalf. past 7 o'clock. After Captain Bell saw her all right and made secure, he went on shore to meet a committee to make arrangements for a pleasure trlp round the lake this week, Having completed this business, he returned on board about half'past 11 o'clock. He walked round the decks, went below to ee that the fires were extinguished, and that the crew were in their berths. Having found all right, he went agai on deck and returned to his stateroom. Shortly before 1 o'clock one of thefiremen had occasion to go on deck.when he was startled at perceiving flames issuing from the centre of thevosseL He gave the alarm, andatthesametimenoticed thatthe wavcthman wasaslcepathispost. Captain Bell rushed out of his room, and, seeing whathsd.oaurred, returnedfor amoment to arrarge part of his dres. At thistime the fire was rising with incredible fury, and almost instantly the centre part of the steamer becausme mass of flames. Tho captain and crew, thus hastily alarmed, made strenuous efforts to quench the flames, but all was entirely fruitlesw. The purser, Mr. T. Rolpb, with great presence of mrind went to his office, foroed the drawer of his desk, andtook out the cash, some 5O dolt" which was the only valuable EAved. The flames had now obtained complete possession of the ill-fated vesEel, and from stem to stern she was onesheet of fire. The brilliancy of the flames illurnated the sur-t rounding shores with extraordinary splendour, while the great heat prevented the slightest assistance being rendered m saving any of the property on board. For the eircunaference of nearly a mile it was as bright as day, the showers of sparks thrown about rendering it a grand but melancholy scene. Danger was now apprehended that the wharf and adjoining buildings would take fire, and it was deemed judLcious to cut the steamer adrift. This was done, and as she slowly reoeded into the bay she formed a pictoresque sight. She drifted across until within about a quarter of a mile of the rail -ay dep6t, when, after becoming stationary, as it were, for a few minutes, ahe sank with a loud hissing noise. The Joseph C. Morriscn was built at Bell Ewart some three years since, at a coEt of 65,000 dollars, and apparently every preeaution was taken to guard against accident; yet she took fre and was consumed, no one knows how.-YTor;to Glabe.

The gentleman protsed that he had offered the defendant at least as much as he wvas entitled to, and on asking them both about it he found that the defendant had driven the gentlemen from the South-Eastern Railway offlce to the Regent's-cirotus and from there to the Eastern. Counties station. For this the genUemau tendered him 3s. 6d., but the defendant refused to receive, it demauding 5s., and on the gentleman declining to pay it, as being more than the defendant was entibled to, he was subjected to this insult and annoyance. Witness referr&et to the book of fares to ascertain what ought to be paid, which turned out to be only 3s, and was about to decide against the defendant5 when the gentlemn asked him to relese him from the cabman, who was atil pertinaciously holding himi by -the necok. Witness ordered him to leave go, and attempted to make him do so, when a,violent struggle ensued between them, both fell together to the ground, and the assistance of other officers was necesay before the defendant was overpowered and secured. Mr. Kent, the superintendent of the police, said the gentleman referred to was an officer in the 93d Regiment, who had been obliged to go by the express train to Colchester, but who would pit np with the inconvenience of returning to town if it was absolutely necessary to do so. Mir. D'EYNcoraT told the defendant it was fortunate for him that the gentleman was not in attendance, or he would have had to answer other charges as well as this ; as it was, he oould only be punished for the assault on the oonstable, and for that he must pay a penalty of 20e., or in default suffer 10 dae' imprisonment in the Houee of Correction. The defendant bad not the money, and was taken away in the van. CLEnwXnu rw -Patrick Mlahoney, a costermonger, of New-street, St. Giles's, was charged before lr. TYRyWE, at the instance of the Rooyal ociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with having crmelly ilRtreated a 4donkey In the New Cattle-market. Fom the ewdence of William Love and George Seaman, two of the society's officexs, it appeared that they were On duty in the New Cattle-market, when they saw the prisoner and another man driving a donkey up and down one of the market avenues. The ri soner was belbouring it in a most brutAl manner with a thick cudgel over its hocks and the small part of its hind legs. The blows were given with such violence as to make tbe donkey stagger about, so as hardly to be able to keep on its legs. Te don}ey appeared a most willing animal, and was trottng as fast as it could. Finding remonstauce of no avail, they took the prlsoner into custocy. In defence the prisoner said he had given the donkey but -very few blows before he was taken into custody. The magistrate, after oensuring the prisoner for his brutal conduct, fned him 20s. or 14 days in the House of Correetion. In default of payment the prisoner was looked up. John Mnnitt, aliae William Probert, a ticket-of-leave man, was placed at the bar, on remand, charged with haviug entered the dweling-house of Mr. Eran Jarrett, a derk, resding atNo. 1, Mary-street, Arlington-square, Islington. 'The prisonez entered the prosecutor's house during the abSence of the family with a false key, and ransacked the place, putting on the trousers and coat of Mr. Jarett. While escaping from the back of the house he was apprehended by the pollwo, and the whole of the property stlen recovered. The prisoner was tried at the Middlesex Fsions ou the .16th of August, 1852, for felony, and was then sen. tencedtolOyear transportation. Duaringhis inarceration. his conduot was very good, and while engaged on the publio works it was describedx as exemplary. The prisoner said he waa" guilty," and should like the case settled at once. Mr. Coanr said he could not do that. The case must go to the sessions, as the prisoner had been tried before. The prisoner said no one had done more, no one oould have trled more, than he had for the purpose of gainingan hotest livelihood. but all to no avail Wherever he went the police were after hbim, p ted him out, and scandalized his charaote_. He never should have committed a second offence had not the police hunted him about from pillar to post; and it was only a few days sinoe that, upon ooming to this court to make an affidavit, one of the officers took hold of bis collar and threw him into the street. The prisoner was then conitted for trial. THl& -Mr. Thomas Carey, fish manure m nufacturer, who has lately taken possession of premises on the banks of the Lea-cut, or canal, leading from limehouse to Bromley, appeared before Mr. YARvIDsY to answer a summons taken out by Mr. Edward Fulcher, inspector of nuisances and ranitary Inspector for the Poplar District Board of Works, which harged him with having a large accumulation of stinking fish deposited on his premises, constituting a nuisance and injurious to health. The defendant was also called upon in the samie summons to show cause why an order should not be made upon him to remove the nuisance and discontinue to make any furtherdeposdt. Mr. YAnDLxY said ho wouid adjourn the case for a week to enable the parties to come to some arrangement, but would stroigly recommend Mr. Carey to get snother place. LAS niL-Dxvid Reedy, who has been ia custody for the last week on a charge of stabbing James Purcell in the right eye with a sharp-pointed penknife, was placed at the bar before Mr. ELLsOTT for final examination. It will be recollected from the statement of the prosecutor on the last examination that on tie evening of the 10th of June last the parties got larking after leaving a bder8hop, when Pur. cell threw down the prisoner once or twice, and the latter, feeling annoyed, an not being a match for the former, drew out alwife, and with abaskhanded blow sent the penblade into the right eye. Such was the force of the blow that the instrament was left fast in the wound, and it was with some difficulty it was pulled out. Mr. Key, a surgeon, in Cold Harbour-lane, deposed that on the evenig of the 10th of June last the prosecutor was brought to his house with a punctured wound on his right eye, which appeared to have been made by a sharp-pointed knife, and Paurcell held a knife in his hand by which be said it had been done. ThLe wound seemed to be of a serious and dargerous nature, and after dressing it he sent him to the hospital. He (witnoss) had examined the prosecutor's ee on that day and found that the sight was completely destroyed. The prisoner, who sidahe was drunk when he committed the act, was fully committed for triaL James Cutler, a journeymen painter. who was chaged on a former day with grossly neglecting his foar children, appeared before the magistrate. Mr. Hazletine3 the relieving officer of the parish of Newington, Informed fr. Elliott that the children were still at the workhouse, and such was the state to which they had been reduoed by shear neglect and want of care and cleanliness that some time must elapse before thev would recover, and he (witness) very much wished that hbi Worship would hear the ti=timeny of the master of the workhouse as to the state in which the poor children were when brought under his observation. Mr. Alfred Feist, the master of the workhouse, was here sworn, and said that in the course of many )ears' experience he bad never witnessed anything half so doplorable as the dtate the unfortunate children were in when brought to the workhouse. So enormous were the quantities of vermin with which they were covered that the lice had actually burrowed under the skin of their heads, forming laTge nests there, and leaving behind them wounds so deep and sores so extensive that no person would credit their extent without seeing them. A,f the -bildren were still in a very bad state, particularly the youngest but one, who had been reduced to such * state that it appeared donbtful whether it would reoover or not. On hearing this Mr. EtLLIoTT further adjonred the eww, to give r. gasletine an oprtity of ooflting the Board of Guardians as t whether they would prosecute the defendant or not,

The chief quesAion, therefore, for the jury vas th state of health of the ahepid at the time the policy was entered into.

The company felt the great importance and value of policies of insurance when effected bl'ndfide with the office, butin the present instance he oonfidently submitted that the contract had been entered into with the office for a large sum of money upon an untrue staement of fact, and a mlasrepresentation of circumstnce most material to the lisk under which the directors had been induced to enter iato that contract. He should rhow them that the policy was effected on the 3d of January, 1856, when one years premium was paid, and that the assred died in the follow. ngJuly, and he should prove beyond all doubt that .he deceased's health had suffered from a severe ilnes resulting In brain fever, with which he had been attaoked in August, 185; that the affairs of the deceased had become very much embarrassed at that time, and having suflered much mental anxiety, it became necessary that he should have change of air, and accordingly he went to Blackpool upon Friday, the 23d of A u of that year, in a very low state of mind, and having faijed in his business on Saturday he became very seriously IIl, and was attended there by Dr. Risk and another medical man, the former of whom treated the cae as one of brain fever. This ilness lasted until the end of September, and on the 13th of that month the deceased wrote from his bed to a friend, speaking of himself, stating that he had been attacked with brain fever, and in October he had again written to the manger of a bank, to which he had become indebted, in answer to an applica tion fora policy on his life, that no ofrioe would sccept his life on account of his state of health. The learned counsel further said that the medical man who had signed the " declartion" as the attendant of the deoeased had not seen him sine the year 1853, and that no mention whatever was made to the offioe of this attack, nor was any referenc made to the medical attendant who had attended the deceased previouslyto his death and during his illnees These 'were the facthe should prove in justification of the course the directors had felt themselves constrained to take in OPr Bisk, of B 1ackoo, and several other witneses were then called for the defence, which was going on when our lr.

This was an action brought by the plaintiff, a solicitor, against the defendant for various advances made to bim while at Cambridge daring the years 1850 to 1852. It appeared that the father of the defendant had spoken to the plaintiff originaly respecting his desire that his son should go to the University, where his abilities might lead to sucess, and it was ultimately agreed between the plaintiff and defendant that plaintiff should supply him with any necessary aistance. The defendant denied hs liability, and insisted that at the time of his going up to Cambridge his father had left in the hands of the planutiff a sum of money to be appropriated to the wants c' the defendant. The plintiff denied that any selh arngement had ever been made with the father, and he proved that at the time the defendant went to Cambridge the whole of the money had been drawn out by the father, 'who was stilL in debt to the plaintiff, and a letter was put in from the defendant himaelf to the plaintiff, in June, 1852, in which he acknowledged the advan,es which had been made, and agreed to a chare of interest, Verdict for the plaintiff, 308.

QAPPRE TROOPS FOR IDIXA. TO TE1B EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I trast that Colonel Napier's suggestion to raise African regiments will meet with due attention from those on whom will devolve the reorganization of the Indian army. While it would add to the military efficiency of that army (for, exoept its Europeans, it possesses no soldiers so good as these would make), such an addition would help to form a counterpoise to the native part of the force Colonel Napier is in the right when he says that the various fatigue and detached duties incidental to Indian service can be best performed by n.,tives of a tropical climate. Why not, now that we know by experience the danger of maintaining so large a preponderanoe of native troops, mix them with others who, with different language and habits, wQuld stand apart from sympathy and intercourse with them? A' the same time, I have no doubt of the wisdom of maintaining a largerEuropeanarmyinIndixthanheretofore.Whenrailroads are established they will be more cheaply and in all respects more satisfactorily maintained; kept in selected healthy stations tUll their services are actually required, they will be much less exposed to sickness, and will have far fewer gaps to filuptha has probably been hitherto the case. If the proportion could be fixed at something like one-fourth the entire strength of the army, and if an equal number of Africans could be regimented, what should we ever have to fear from the remainig half of nativeso It was the policy of the Roman contuerors to strengthen their legions with auxviliaries drawn from the conqeered provinces, to w?hom they communicated a lighter kind of dasesplnond eqimn hnt hlegionaries. Why should wie not do the same? Are the dress, disoiphine, and organization of t'he British army so congenial to natives that we must needs imitate them after the servile fashion that has neretofore prevailed7 Let those who have seen a Sepoy regiment under arms or on the march ans ver the qwsstion; nay, let their own officers do so. light we not with advantage take a lesson in this respect from our neiehbours in Algeria?

" WITth regard to the machinery, we are of opinion that the form of controlling power adopted and the mode ot lubricating and adjusting the brealks admit of very great improvement. " We are thoroughly convinced from the soundings made by Ideutenant Berrymnan, lUnited States' Navy, on the plateau between Newfoundland and Ireland, subsequently confirmed by Lieutenant Dayruan, Royal Navy, and the 2nvestigations of Lieutenant Maury, United States' Observatory, and from our own nautical experience, that no mnder or surface current exists between these points to inter. fere with the su ccessful layiDg of your cable. "We all agree in thinking that no form of submarine telegrph cable could be devised more suitable in every ro spect to theobject intended to be accomplished; that its lightness, toughness, and flexibility adapt it in every way for the purpose of being laid between Newfoundland and Ireland, and we ate unwiling to recommendits modification or alteration in any way. We are also of opinion that no natural obstacles exist to prevent its being successfully laid between those points, and our views as to the future pros pects of your enterprise are sanguine.

"Fenton's Hotel, London, Aug. 24." TO THlE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-This is my abstract of the misfortune to the Atlantic Telegraph cable, as gathered from the details which have been placed before the public, with customary clearness, in The Tnmes :-The cable broke because the ship rose with a wave or " se," causing a sadden at5ain on the great length of oable hasging and bearing on the vesseL But had there been a skilled engineer to ease the breaks as the "see" ca&ne the cable would merely have run out at a rate increasing with the rise of the ship's stern, instead o£ the strain being so increased by it that the cable snapped. That, Sir, I think is a fair and intelligible proposition in regard to the present position of the company that was undertaken to carry out this highly impostacti work. Therefore, as a vessel of the size required to carry sruch an immense length oF cable wivl not yield to the strain of the cable, but jerk it when a " sea" strikes her - and as it is clear this is why the recent accident and present loss ocourred, is it not worth whilo to consider whether something cannot be arranged for the cable to run Over that would yield to the waves, and therefore act, as occasion may require, as an inclined plane to lessen the angle at which the cable in the recent trial was strained? A fisherman does not float" the nets he intends placing in a standing position, so that when a wave comes the floats lift the " leads"' off the bottomi- if he did he would be unsucceseful, as the finny tribe would'pasm avay and be no more seen, but he calculates the weight of the nets and the leads required to keep them in position, and he trims them with tioats of lust sufcient buoyancy to keep a strain on the lead-lines, without the possibility of waves actingon thesefloats and raising the nets from their intended position, or, as would sometimes happen, breaking them. As the floats and leads are to the fishermnen's nots, so are the ship, cable, and bottom of the Atlantic to the Atlantic Telegraph cable. Alter the fisherman's principle, suppose a number of pontoons were first linked together, and then attached to the stern of the vessel paying out, and these were of just sumdent power or buoyancy to bear the weight of the cable without disappearing under water during a calm. when a sea did come, and con^equently the understood strain on the cable came with it, the tail of this line of pontoons would yield to the weight of the cable, and, instead of there being a jerk that would cause another snap of the cable, an inclined plane would be admitted of, maintained, orprodueced, and the process of paying out would not be molested nor the perfectness of the cable endangered. I am no engineer, therefore I do not pretend to be able to point out a complete auxiliary of this kind in respect to the size of pontoons, the distance they should. be apart, nor the niumber tbat would be the more practicable to use : but this much I may say-the increased draught this would impose on the engines is not worth consideration, for rafts of timber are towed at greater speed than the vessel moved, arnd the fiest one might be made lighter-like, so as not greatly to impede progress As to nuraber, let there be, say, a dozen. Then comes the question, howshouldthecablebe conduated over, and what ksind of loops should it beconducted through? The stamds and loops tbrough which it wonld have to run woud, of corrsc, be placed in the centre of the pontoons, Stands would probably be required on those nearer the stern of the vessel; let the first be Six feet high, say, with as much play, or nearly so, for the cable to pravent any upwaTrd or downward stress from the vessel and the nearer pontoon not keeping time. The second stand migiht be five eet high, with as mich Play for the cable, and so on, till the cable ran through ex es or loops, immediately on the top of the pontoons. As to the last one, it might bemade to pass slick through the middle of it, and if this one was made of rather smaller size than the one before it, or if each one was smaller than the one before it, the effect in view might be more perfectly aecomplished perhaps, At first sight this line of pontoons may appear to have a great ten dency to capsize, but as the cable itself -would keep the stands in position, and there would he a continual prCEssure Of the Oak-'le on the latter ones, this notic-n appears at second sight to be imupossible. But, Sir, there is more than the above to be said in support of this method. In your excellent article on this subject In The Tiezes of to-day there Is this sentence:-" On the 10th the vessel paid out 255 miles of cable, and had made 2l4 miles fr,m shere." Thus, in one tenth of the distance 41l miles were lost. At this rate 400 miles would be lost in the whole distance. But as the length of cable to diFtance of ocean undoubtedly increaees zs fathoms of water increase, it is only fair to reckon that 500 miles would have been paid out over and above the distance from Valentia to New"foundland. Five hundred miles of the cable in question is worth a good round sam, and if all cannot be separed, if somne of it can, it is worth doing, In the quotation you used, Sir, are these words:"Wen the rate of the vwheels grew slower, as the ship dropped ber stern in the swell the break should have been eased," Exactly; so tbat, when the " sea " raLed the stern of the vessel-say, a fathom -tix feet of the cable might have rushed out in waste-that is, witl tbe then arraugemaents, with every wave or " sea " it required that six feet of cable beyond the length of oceansailed over sbould be allowed to run out, that the whole project might not miscarry. Therefore, if 1,000 waves or seas occurred in a mile, atthe supposed low rate of loss fromrthis cause 6,000feet would be irretrievably lost. Would this have happenedthis loss of 4t miles in 255 miles-if a tail-like apparatus of pontoons, that would have yielded float-like to the waves, had been used, as above iumperfectlg described? If not, and if it wonld be a Means of lessening materially the danger of the cable agaia snapping, would it not be worth while for the engineers of the company to consider how such an apparatus can be best constmeted ? From the interest felt in comnmon respecting the instrurment that wilUadmit the old world anid the new world to feel ech other's 5pulseadaily-nay, hourly-1 have addressed these views, which strnck me as r read your artiole in you journal of to-dayg; and if you sh1ould deem them of sugi-ient importance to occupy a place in the columns that bave matter uressSed upon them from aU corners of te vworld it Your nbediAn .t .. .v,..

NORFOLK. The half-yearly meeting of this company was beld yester* dv atthe London Tavern, Mfr. Till in the chair. trh Hutt, the secretary, read t-he report, which taltedthat athe Mount credited to the Norfolk Company by the Eastern Counties Company was 42,9251., as their proportion of the joint earnings, after deducting working and other eharges, showing an increase of 1,7061. over the corre sponding period of lasbt ear, and would enable the proprietors to declare a dividend of 11. 10s. per cent upon the ordinary stock of the comDany for the half-year, leaving a balance of 514. for the next acount. In reference to the claim bDy the Eastern Eounties Company for expenditure for new works on the line, a prouceition had been made that 50,0001. should be accepted by`th Eastern Counties Company in full of all clains on the Norfolk Company, and in this the direotors are prepared to advise the concurrence of the shareholders, provided the revenue accounts and other matters of difference between the two companies be settled at the same time. In the event of the ! proposition being caried out, it will be necessary to provido the 50,0001., which may be raised by 5 per cent. preference shares. The agreement between the three companies provides that the outlay for newr works should be borne by the company on whose linesuchnew works maybe required, such compLny to be allowed interest in respect of such outlay. The Norfolk Cowpany wdll therefore be entitled to receive interest on this sum from the profits of the united undertakings ot the aesosiated companies, when adjusted and paid to the Eastern Counties Railway Company, so thatt only oneseventh will fall on this company. The branch fromi Fakeni has to Wells has been completed, with the exception of the junction at Fakenham. In the early stage of the proceedings of the East Suffolk Company the directors strongly recommended an arrangement with that company, and it is satisfactory to them that the directors of the Eastern Counties Compay have also arrived at the same conclus'on, Iand an arrangemnt has been entered into by the EAstern Coutnties Company with the East Suffolk Company. The capital account showed that 2,229,435!. had been received, and 2,218,9<92!, expended, leaving a balance of 10,442!. The revenue account showed that 15,5374 was the balance avail;able for dividend, The CHAxamAN, in moving the adoption of the report, £aid the dividend they were about to declare was 30s. per cent., but at the corresponding period of lastyear it was only 25s. per cent. This was the more satisfactory as the traffc bad gone on gradually increasing, and it was reasonable to suppose that it had not yet arrived at its full extent, The glOsareCeipts underthe agreement towhich theywere entitled , mounted to 81,5481. In the year 1854, to 84,9791. in the 3ear 185, and to 90,2941. in the year 1856, so they would I srceive there was a gradual improvement, and there was r o reason why it should not contanue. He had mentioned a-t the last meeting that he had no doubt by the exercise of I rlper economy that the Eastern Counties Company could i ork the traffic on the three lines under the average of 46 er cent. It had for that half-year coat them 51 per cent, ut he was glad to see they had reduced the expenases in the ipst half-year to afraction over 46 per cent. The csrtage of ,oodsinvolved aconsiderable expense. A verylargesum kadbeencharged to the NorfolkCompany,amounting to 70,0001., for new works and other matters connected with the development ef the traffic. They fotnd it vwas of no use to go on with unsettled accounts. The claim was gone into at considerable length, and it was found that several of the works were indispen. Fable and prodaced a urufitable result. It was settled for a mur of bot00?, whlch would be paid over on the settlement of other outstanding accounts between the two CamE panies. He would be glad if some competent person would undertake tho settlement of those matters between the three companies. Re was glad that an arrangement had been come to wish the East $nfrolk Compan*y; he believed it was a give and take agreement, ind that it would do away -will all competition. The ngreement would be submittedto tbe shareholders for their approval at.tbe propertime. The Norfolk and Eastern Union Company had engaged Mx. I rnif to see that their permanent way and works were kept in a proper state of repair by the Eastern Counties Coini esolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend of 30s. per cent. on the original stock, and the usual divideDds on the preference stocks, payable on the 15th Iof September, The meeting was then made special, and the directors ! were anUtorized to raiEe 50,000. by the issue of 10,000 j5!. shares to be guarantteed 5 per cent. per anntum. } The Cn .3ry stated that; it wfas not likely that they would require to raise any more capital, as the amelgaiaatior oE the three companies would take place prior to A vote of thanks to the clhairman and directors concluded the proceedings. BRADFORD, WAKEIELD, AND LEEDS. The quarterly meeting of this company was held at Bradford,yesterday; Mr. Anderton presided. I The Secretary, Mr. Carr, read the report, which stated that the late heavy rains had caused slips in the excavations, and that three weeks would yet ba required to. fnish the line, even if the weather were favourable. The contrctor, Mr. Young, had promised to exert himself to get the line eaoy by tbat time. It was stated by the chairman that the delAy whioh had already taken place in this respect had been serioaslv prejudicial to the interests of the ithareolders, but at the sime time tho directors had done erverything to assisS the contractor, and no cause for the delay could be attributable to the company. According to the bond betrween them and the contractor, he wsa to have the line ready for opening by the 1st of April, then it was delayed till the 1st of May, next to the 1st of August, and now, from the ststements made, it would at the nearest be driven to the 14th or 15th of September. The contractor was bound in a penalty of 12,000! to have the works finished by the time specified, whether exacted or not, and the non-fulfibnent of this agreement would, it was estimated, entail a loss on the companv of 8,0001. or 9,0001. The capilael account showed that 179,8041. had been received, and 1S6,2381. expended, leaving a balance due to tho bankers of 6,4844. LEOirNSTER AND EI5!GTON. Yesterday the half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Leominster; Mer-Admiral. Sir Thomnas Hastings, C.B., presided, The directors' report stated that the dividend of 4 per cent. upon all the shares of the company, payable under the contract with Messrs. Brn'sey and Field, would accrae as from the 1st of July last past, and consequently the first half-year would be payable in January next. The directors felt confident that the advantages of the line would be fully appreciated by the district which it acommodated, and thathbaving secured an immediate dividend of 4 per cent. upon the shares, with the further eveatual advantages which would hereafter accrue, the remaining capital necesSary for discharging the cost of the undertaking would be speedily tak-en up, and that the traffic upon the line would realize the expectations of its promoters. .Ur. WYLIm, the engineer, stated in his report that the Board of Trade had assented to the level crossing at Pem. bridge and dispensed with a bridge. The obalance-sheet stated the total receipts at 76 8031, inclusive of 215,350! in loans. The payments for the half-year to the 30th of Jdone last amounted to 5,5011., and the total payments to 76,7511, leaving a balanc of 521. 3s. at the hanker. On the motion of the CsrMNA.ir, seconded by hr. mG, MYP., the report was adopted. The CArsiarA,haviing urged the importancecof getting the remaining shar'e Capital taken, up, Mr. Frt, one of 'he lesoese referred to a ramour that he had delayed the opening of the line for his own benefit as a coal agent at Leominster, and in repudiation thsreof stated that the non-progress of the works had been a serious loss to himself and partner, in addition to which 6,0. worth of plant for working the line bad been lying idle ftor th o 4yea , O .at-nd ttihey had balstoh lost 4 per cent. in .

Tho report of the directors of this company staete tht they entertain a confident opinion that the receipts will be considerably increased during the current quarter. The Ardsley branch is now completed, and they only await the opening of the Bradford, Wakefield, and Leeds Rlwa,y, in crder to commence workdng the traffic. The receipts, 3otwithstanding the severe depression of trado during the months of Aril and May, hsve been progressive. The s oport of Mr. Hawkshaw, the engineer, states that the first notice has been given to the Board of Trade for the < uening of the extension line to Ardsley, and that ne works will be corapleted and roady for in-I ection by the Government officer abott the end of this month. The contractor's time for maintaining lbs Gildersome Branch expiredon the 20th. Onexamining she works the previous week he found portions of them in a *ondition which did not justify his approval of them on behalf of the company, but that, at the same time, the con- 'ractor was busy in making good the defective parts, Ho hoed, however, to have everything in good order by the End of this month, and considered that it would be neces- sary for the diretora to make immediate provision for taking hemaintenance of the Gildersome branch into their own hands. The capital aocount showed that 515,8731. had been expended.

The heavy charges which had formerly been mode on sevenne for servioes performed from wlhich no remuneration was received would, under the altered tircmnstances of the company, receive the consideration of the directors, who hoped to be ablo to make such reasonable charges upon the freighte.s as would beacooptablo to thee and remunerative to the proprietors, By these means by strict economy, byraising the additional capital on the most favourable terms, he hoped to maintain the present rate of dividend.

In the half-yearly report of this company the directors announce * considerable improvement in the traffic of the line as eompared with the corresponding period of 1856. The total receipts for the past half vear are 11,4241., being an increase of 2,1661. over thenal-year ending in June, 1856; the amount per mile per weak averages over 121. It appears by the statement of aocounts that there is a balance applicable to dividend of 1,840&, after paying interest due on advances and loaus. and dividend on preference stock, Out of this the directors reomamend the wmal dividend of 6s. per share on the original paid up shares of the company, leavng 1261. to the next aocount. DUBLIN AND BELFAST JUNCTION. It appears that the directors of this company have re solved on recommending a dividend for the past hal£-fear at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, less income-tax, leaving 6,7041. to be carred to the credit of the current haIl-year's account. In explanation of the reduction in dividend to the extent of I per cent, per annum, the directors state that for some years past the dividend has been mantained by applying in aid of the revenue a portionof the interest from time to time realized on cals inl arrear, hut nlo income from that sour¢c having been lately received they do not deem it prudent at present further to encroach on the reserve fund.
