New York in July 1UK4 and his Grand Inauguration ffestival at thre StoyWa m ury Gardens, in July, 1886. It wvas on this last occassion that H. Jasilen had the idea of assmbling in L-ondon, for the darst time, deputatirne from all the leading muctical associations and cathedral choirs of England, Scotland, IreIanel and the continent, to the number of 3,100 performecs There. suit?produced by such a choice sand numerous assmblage of t4lent was mctasatisfactory, and musical amateurs, the public, and the press sans- nlsnously rtnounoed the Festival to have been the gteatet musica er-~ formanoe I London since the Handel Festival, at Westmuinster Abbay, In1854. The Festivalt wvhlch will lastl0d%ys,WHrcomma-,,c witisthe production of Haydn's t5rltto, the Creation; this WUIl be succeeded by Meudeambos'sOraktorio, Eljah. ad by Haydn' Seas-ons,in four parts Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter-generally considered his rnee composition. The revival of this Inst work bsa, Just taken place at Veiena, Berlin, and Paris, and Is creating an onparalieled Sensation among the musical population of thoce capitas the performianoes having been repeated several timed in presence of the reeDective sore. re!gas.the 0Ossrt,and the Chsts of the nobility and amateurs Thee wuil be followed by a'RoseDin Festival, selected firom Hiose In Egito Stabat Mate and Guilaume Te1li;and a Verdi Festival, withseolections from 1Rabuco, Lea Vtipres Stoilieumes, I Lombardi Xrnacci, La Traviata, and H1 Trovatore. After them will be given a Beethoven Night, a Mendtelssohn Night and a Mozart Nieht, en a scale even greater and more perfect than those classical evenings which H. Jullien has introducded ash seawon for 17 Yeass and which havealwys ci ith nivrsa aprobation; ausi the Festival wl conclude with agrand performence o, EandelPsOratorio,The Messiah. Hf. Jullien Is not without hope that his musical friends in London and from the provinces the continent, and the United States, who, for the last 25 years, have aided and supported hLis various artistic enterprises will, alter having assistd at the MorninEdPerformances in the Crvqta Palace, gdve a few of their leisure hours unrine that season of festiVity, and repair in the evening to the Hall of the Royal 8urrey Gardens a bullding erected expressly for music, capable of ceutalinin 10000 persons, and pronounced to be the best room in the United Kingdom ror acustirnurDoses. The orchestra of H. Julien, which, in his late triumphant musical tour on the continent, was admitted to be the firet In Europe, is of course lobe bxeard only at his concerts, and none of its members have accpited, or can accept, anuselgagement to Perform elsewhere.

IRELAND. (FROM OUr OWN CORRESPONDNT.) THE IRISH OHIMT SECRETARY. DUBLIN, WEDNESDAY MoRNING. xeI eraay Mr. kLerbert, the new Irish ;Secretary, was re-elected aithout a contest for the county of Kerry. The hon. gentleman was proposed by Sir William D. Godfrey, Bart., Mr. W. Talbot Crosbie seconding the nomination. Mr. Herbert subsequently addressed the electors in a brief and sensible speech. He said,- They had been told by his hon, friend Mr. Crosbie that he office had been conferred on him unsolicited. IHe was perfectly correct In that statemert, andit was also quite trne that it wss with some hesitation he accepted it. But let him aot bo accused of having acted with mock modesty when ha mentioned this hesitation in accepting anything so honourable when offered with clean hands. His hesitation did not, as ho said, arise from any disinclination to offioe, but from a sense of the responzibility attend iag it, and the effect it would have on those habits of p i- vate life which, as a couAtry gentleman, he was accnstomtd to. It could not be from insen1ibility to the honour conferred on a plain country gentleman in tendering to him such an office that he reflected before he accepted it; but it manly arose from the conideration whether in aocepting it he violated any promise previously made to them, whfither he made anypromise or gave any pledge that was inconsistent with his accepting this office, for he would say this, in the most unaffected manner, that no honour, however high, no emolument however considerable, would compensate him for the violatios of any pledge he made, or the breaking of any promise that he might have Oiven to the electors of Kerry. (Hear.) He would unhesitatingly say, then, that he never gave a pledge or made a promise that would render it inoonsistent in him to take office. (Hear.) He would call their attention to the fant time he addressed them, ten years ago, when they did him the honour of electing him as their representative. All that time it was the general opinion that members should tutn their chief attention to the material interest of the country, and he was asked whether he would hold himself independent of any Minister who would not earry out the interests in the view of certainparties? He answeredthat he would, if returned,go intoParliament asa plain country gentleman, and as such discharge his duties. He said that he had no wish to take office, but advocate the interests of the county; at the same time, he said that if the day should ever arrive, and that, being considered fit for it, an offer was made to him of office, he saw no reason why ihe or any other honourable tnan should fail to aSsist in the service of his country. (Hear.) Several now present remembered this. (Hear;) Ue added on that occasion that it was his inrention to hold himself independent of all parties, and when he first entered Parliament he did keep himself aloof from sall parties, and, though he had many personal friends connected with party, he never attended me3tings that would involve himn party association, but applied himself to the advancement of those material questions most affecting the country during the period of that frightful famine which visited them. The hon. gentleman then referred to the past he had taken during that period, for whieh he got more credit than he deserved by the votes of thanks from Poor Law Boards and other publie bodies. Well, he acted that in. dependent pazt up to the formation of Lord Aberdeen's Government, when, seeing from the formation of that Go. vernment that there was a guarantee for the enforcement of those liberal measures which he thought would benefis the country, he gave that nobleman his support. They were all aware of the cause of the break-up of that Government, and the part he took on the oocasion. It was right for him to say that he was offered an official position by that nobleman, but did not deem it prudent to accept it. He then went on to give his reason tor supporting Lord Palmerston, which principa'2ywas for his sucoessful termination of the war. e afterwards reviewed the question of tenant-right (amid some interruption from the gallery, which accused him of introducing Scotch tenants on his estate and turm ingoutRerrymen), observing that, howeverfeasibleit minht anPear to frame a measure for the settlement of this question, when it Came to be practically carried out very great difficulties had been exPerienced by Lord Stanley, the Duke of Newcastle, Sir J. Young, Mr Napier, and others, all zealous and honest in their intentions, and sd that there were no greater enemies to the tenanta than those who professwd to be their exclusive friends-men who, from proposing and advocating impracticable tenantright measures, defeated all praeticable and reasonable legislation. le was himself always of opinion that no language was too strong to express indignation against a landlord who turned out a tenant who expended his capital on the land withont -ving him compensation, but he deprecated retrosgectve leiation, as calculated to injure the tenant more t an serve n, by involving both in endless litigation, and asserted that none but prospective legislation was possible. He next camne to the question of national education, disapproving 3Mr. Wadpole's measure, wFhile he paid a high compliment to that gentleman personally for hi amiabDlityv ability, integrity, and position, and said that he would maintainas far as he could'the present system intact in TENANT RIGHT IN PRACTICE. A curious adveretiement, bearing upon the question of tenant right in 'Ulster, appears in one of the northern papers The Rev. Alexander ROs Goudy, a Presbyterian Minister, who has recently become a considerable landowner by purchsaes in the Encumbered Estates Court, announces for sale by public auction one of his farms in the county of Monaghan, consisting of 33 statute acres, subject to a yearly rent of ll. per acre, with a lease for 40 years, containing a clause in it to the effect that if the purchaser of the tenant right, or his legal representative, shall at anZ time during the existence of the said lese fine aown the rent to lOs. per statute acre, on the conditions proposed by subacriber to his other tenantry, that then subscriber, or his representatives, be compelled to execute a lease to the purchaser of the tenant right, or his legal representative for IO&s per statute acre, for the residue of subcdri6er's term, exceeding 850 years. The conditions imposed on the purchaser are thee :-A deposit of one-third of the purchase-money will be required on the purchaser of the tenant right being declared, and the remainder of the purchase-money, except 1001., to be paid on getting possession of the land, and the lease executed. 1001. of the purchase-money of the tenant right will get leave to lie on the farim, on its own security, for five years, at 4 per cent. per annum.

THE FeXxCH ARm;sy.-The Maniteur contain3 the commencement of the annual report made to the Emperor by the superior commission appointed to carry out the provisions of the law of 26th -pril, 155, on the dotation of the French army. After point ng out the satisfaction felt by families at the working of this new measure, which has redeved them from the frauds so frequently praotised by the office4 which undertake to procure substitutes, the report states that on the present plan the men who reenlist immediately receive a sum which enables them to assist their famUies and are oertain, on again quitting the service, of receiving a still largersum. Duringtheterm of service they receive, for the first re-enlistment of seven years, the pay of 36f. 50c. a-year simultaneously with the allowance de chevrons, which amounts to 47f. 45c a-year. After 14 yeaWrs service they eceive 7 &3f a-year, cumulated also with that de cern,as amounting to 73£. After 25 years' service, or even before, in case of wounds or infirmes, they have a pension allowed them, iso that the can return to their homesi at the age of 45 -with the enjyeto eso of not less than a franc a-day. Theeport ten oes on point out the advantages which have resulted from the law or the composition of the army, which by the new enat ments refains in itg iankz a great number of old soldiers having a taste for the service, well disciplined, and accus tomed to the hardships attendant on a military lfe. The new measure preserves to the army not only exellent instructors, but also the best models of discipline, abnegation and duty, andunitesthe energy and soldity of these old soldiers to the enthusiasm of tne young ones. After pointing out in detail the arrangements made by the Minister o' war, at the suggestion of the commission, for carrying into efrect the provisions of the law,threotsas that, according to the information coleted by stthecon mission, thc sum to be paid for exoneration from service, in order to be in harmony with the probable price which would have been required for a substitute on the old system, should be fixed at 3.200f at the lowest. In the opinion of the commission the pnrce ought to be below that usually paid for substitutes under similar circumstances, and it therefore had at first fixed the price for exoneration for the class of 1855 at 2,800i. The exonerations granted by the councils of revision in the class of 18oS amounted to 22,427, in addition to which 1,209 exonerations were given by the councils of the dif ferent corps, making the total number on the Ist of June, 1856, 23,636. The number of re-enlistments at the same period was 31,808 showing a surplus of 8,172. In presence of this surplus tne commission thought it its duty to suc cessivelyr educe the premium for re-enlistment from 2,800a. to 2,300., and afterwards from 2 300f. to L500f. The reenlistments, which in 1855 amounted to 22,800, were in 1856 only 16,830 being a diminution of 5,970. Although the situation oi 1856 was thus numericaly less satisfactory than that of 1855, it was more so as regards the qualiti of thoes who re-enlisted. In 1855 the number of sub-officers who re-enlisted was 10,756, and in 1856, 3,909; c*orporals 2,900 and 1,503; privates, 9.144 and 11,218. In 1856, as compared with 1855. the re-enlistments for three years declined from 21 to 20 per cent. of the total number of the year, and those for five years increased from 7 to 8 per cent. The sub-officers only reckoned for 23 per cent. of the totai number of re-enlistments instead of 47, the corporas for 10 per cent. instead of 13. while the privates stood for 67 pr cent. instead of 40. This fact, says the report, shows that the advautages of the law of April, 1855, were every day better understood and appreciated among the lower ranks of the army. This first portion of the report conclndes by stating the amount of the reoeipts. The sum paid into the Caisse de Dotattbn in 1856 for exonerations in the class of 1855 amounted to 62,899,200f. The donations nade to the ckFse, and authorized by decree of 7th July, 1856, amounted to 4,8001

Mr. HARDY moved the second reading of this BilL Mr. KER SEYM?ER, in risng to move that the Bill be read a second time that day six months, expressed the reluctance which he felt in doing so, not because he was not convinoed of the propriety of such a oourae, but because he was uuuwilUing to appear to be n opponent of a memaure broughtwith the view of putting an end to intemperance. Without being a teetotaller, or a supporter of the absurd Maine Liquor Law, he felt at the same time a sinoere desire to do everything to encourage temperance and sobriety, and he was satisfied thathis hon.friend inbringng forward this motion,had been actnatedbyadeep conviction of the evils arising from drunkenness. That drunkenness was a vice which did prevail in this country to a considerable extent he could.not deny, but he did not believe that it had increased of late year On the contrary, many causes had tended to diminish it. Not mAny years ago the example set by peopleof po'itioz, by country gentlemen, and even in many cases by country clergymen, had by no means tended to disoourage that vice; but now the tone of society had entirely changed in that respect. Then, again, there were other causes, such as the increased sense of responsi. bility among employers of labour as to the welfare of thote whom they employed, improved dwellings for the working cles, sanitary improvements, and general cause of that description, which tendedto discourage drunkenness; somuch so, in fact, that he did not oonsider it Utopian to hope that in time it would almost oemae to exist. With regard, howe*er, to the immediate question, he would remind the House that, after the report of the oommitee which had been appointed to inquire Into the lioensing system, those persons interested in preserving the monopoly published a circul in which they set forward that the lloezsse of houses had become, matter of familysettlement. Now, hehad on a former occaion been called a young freetrader; that was true, but he was one of those who, having fought the, battle against free trade, now that the cause for which he had contended was lost and the principle of unrestrncted competition admitted, wished to see that principle carried to its fullest extent. Now, would any one reoognize the principle that any body of men should determine how many bakers, or grocers, or butchers should open shop3 in any particular neighbourhood? The thing would be preposterous (hear, hear), now, too, when licenses to open publichouses were refused. It appeared that during the last five yers there had been 2,343 applications for licenses, of which 493 had been successful; so that nearly 2,000 applications, more than one probably having been made by the Same person, had been refused during that period. Now, he had a right to a5ssrme, and he did not think that the position would be disputed, that the great majority of those appicLations were made by persons of good character, so that it appeared that a large number of persons who had a good character were prevented b) the present system from having an opportunity of carrying on the trade which they were anxious to follow. Persons whose character was testified to by the clergyman, the churchwardens,andthe most respectable inhabitants of a parish applied for a license. They were opposed by an attorney on the ground of public morality, of course; but it wasnotpublic morality whichpaidtheattorney,it wasprivate monopoly. (Hear, hear.) In fact, the present system simply amounted to this, that from pecliarcrcumstances A acquired the privilege of makdng Her Majesty's subjects drunkvwith spirit, ndB was not allowed todo so. The present system gave rise to great anomalies, and he would mention two cases of peculiar hardship which hadoccurred. When there was a prospect of the railway being carried as far as Weymouth a gentleman had fitted up a hotse as an hotel for the accommodation of travellers, he applied for a spirit licenso, and the lioense was refused. He then, being a person of substance, appealed to the quarter sessions, and the license was granted. but had he been unable from pecuniary means to do so the effect of the present system would have been fatal to him. Then, again, it was only after repeated oomplaints that a lioense was granted at the Southampton station refreshment-room, after having been refused by the magistrate. As to the connexion between the brewers and publicans, be would beg to trouble the House with a few extracts from the evidence of Mr. Hawes, who had himself been a brewer. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to read pasages from the evidence of Mr. Hawes, the purport of which was, that in most cases the publican was dependent to a great degree upon the brewer, and that if that state of things could be put an end to the public would derive advantage from the change. To show how little the brewer stood in need of any assistance, he might -mention that there was a story. told to the effect that one of their body had been in treaty for the purchase of a house in Belgrave-square, but that he had been remonstrated with by three or four other brewers who were residing there already, and who told him it would never do to add to the number. The consequence had been that the gentleman in question had subsided into the comparatively obscure region of Eaton-place. (A laugh.) The story, perhaps, might not be quite true, but he could only say a #non c vero c ben trovato. (Ecar, hear.) With respect to the proprietors of the pubtchouses, it was h is opinion th, as a class, they would suffer no injur if a complete change were made in the system by which they were now regulated. Their present position was not, at all events, of a very satisfactory nature, as was clearly demonstrated by the evidence which had been laid before the committee, testifying to the fact that frequent transFers of those establishments were made from one person to another. Everything that was bad in the system which now prevailed must be traced to the restrictions which it estRblished, and the House might dependupon it that ifthat restriction were removed the result would be, under the auspices of free trade, tbo sale of better articles inour publichouses and the provision of better accommodation for the labouring classes, while no greater degree of immorality than at present existed would be found to prevail. Havingalluded to the question ofiimmorality, he might mention that Mr. B. Gladstone, who was well acquainted with Liverpool,- had tated that in Dale-street, in that towon, a man might gat drunk every day in the week, and yet never go into the sme house for the purpose tsvice. (A laugh.) He (Mr. Seymer) did not know Dale-street, and he was perfectly rea4y to admit that the houses referred to might be for the most part beershops; but hethought he could point out houses in the metropolis where a person might get drunk every day ipthe year uron spirits without being under the necessity of twice resortng to the same establishment. Indeed, no man could fairly contend that there wae the slightest diicty interposed in the y of a person who was incliusdto get drunk upon spirits in sny of the large towns throughout the couttry. (iear, hear.) There we he might add, publichousee in the metropolis which were and which always had been conducted inthe most disorderly manner, As he returned home Erom tht Houe he onA- siantly saw drunken persons comin out of thoepos night after ezght, long fter th ourat ohich beerhops were obliged by law to be closed When those esablh. ments became Fso notorious a to attract the attention of the authorities the licensen were, a matter of general practice, transferred, and thus the nusnce Was perpuated from year to year. From certinturns which had been laid upon the table of the Hous it might be inferred that the great sfeguard in such Instances consinte tb 1olrer to refuse a renewal of the licenss Bat how, he ia did the sytem reUy operate? Why, out of the 6,000 public. house in the metropolis there were but 36 which had not during the last tive yas had a renewal of theirlicenss, and ont of those 36 twelve were situated in Southwark. That atement, however, did not put the matter in its true light, for only 15 pubhchouses had been permanently closed in the metropolis during the lst five years, and of these 12 were in South. warlc, xo tbh in the whole of the remaining portion of the metropolis there wereonlythree in the caee of which aperma. 2enteuspension of their licenses hbdtakenplaoe. How,under those circumstances, could any one oontend that the great safeguard against immorality wss to be sought in the exist. ence of a power to refase to the proprietors of publichouses a renewal of their licenses? (Hear, hear.) That was a view of the question which, in his opinion, no man of common sense ought for a moment endeavour to to uphold. The next point to which he wished to advert was the large sums of money whiohwarespaid for publichonsee, andwhich Alderman Wire, who wa the advocate of the licensed victUallers, had accounted for before the committee by stating they were for the most part paid for the goodwill of those establishynents. Now, he (Kr. Seymer) did not believe that to be the fact, inasmuch as some of the evidence taken before the committee bad clearly -proved that the enhanoed value, to which he alluded, was uowed to operate in very manyinstanoes before these housei had actually been bult; and he, for one, was difoed toreg rd that enhanced vaue as the consequence of a restricted tade. (Hear, hear.) It was said that the proprietors of publichoum were a very regectable class of men, but he had not the fear of Be2lYs life so much before his eyes as to call that portion 4of them, at all events, respectable who as prize. fig'hters obtained a publichouse, because they happened to have a good drinldnz oonnexion. ("yHear, hear," and a laugh.) 1All those discreditable arrangements for prize. fights were made at such establshments. If any hon. member, for instance, wished to ascertin by -what tem. boat he must go, in order to witness one of those encounters in the neighbobrhood of Sussex Marshes, or by what train he ought to proceed with a similar object, and with a good cbhnoe of dodging the police, the best oourse he could take would be to f etthieffbliehouses to which he ha just alluded. (Iaughter.) He believed, indeed, that upon one occasion a train conveying Hler Majesty's justices of ssi had been shun ted off igsline, ineOrder to alIow a train bent upon one of those diceful expe'tions to pas upon its Vay. (Itenewedlatughter.) Beershopewere not sufficiently rpectable to be frequented by members of the prizefighting fraternity; they therefore congregated at -the Public Oset; and there was. at the present imoment one of those houses in which meetings were held from time to time for the purpose of maldng 104 depoeits in the case of a match which ws about to comeofffor 2001 aside. The last thing, however, it would appear, which occurred to the aLuthorities Was to takeawaytheirlicenseefrom suchplace; and the result was that tbey were- allowed to go on in. the manner which he had just aescribed. Novw,heapprehended t ht when those cirmstances weri taken into oaccount the House wold find it 'eitremel difficult to draw anyvr wide distinction between. beershope and publchouses upon the score of moraiaty. (oar,. hear.) From the evidence which had been laid before the committee he was happy to say it appeared that dangerous adulteration of the articles so d in either class of establishment did not in any very considerable degree prevaiL The-worst species of adulteration wshich was practised, WAsthe patting of -alt into the beer, which accounted for the thirst which those who were it the habit of consuming that beverage frequently experienced. (A laugh.) The, chief mode of adulteration, however, W that of dilution - by the use of water; and upon that head- mr. Caldwell, who, he believed, was a dancing master rather than the proprietor of a publichouse, had let the committee into oome of the secrets of, the trade. In reply to a question which hLd been put to him that gentleman said, -We always dash the beer." (A laugh.) "What do you mean by that?" Answer.-"Why, we pump the New-river into it." (Renewed laughter.) Now, the House would perceive that,with reference to the subject of adulteration, the owner of a publichouse stood in a different positon from the proprietorof a beershop. Theformer could afford to sell his beer at a small profit, or, in other word; not to adulterate it, inasmuch the sale of wine and spirits constituted the principal source of his income. The contrary was the case of the man who sold beer alone, because he could not hope to make Un by the profits accruing from the sale of wine and spirits for a diminution in the price of that one article. The competition, then, between both stood uPon a footing unfavourable to the latter. (Erear, hear) tHe wished next to make one or two observations with respect to the bearing of the subSect generally Mpon the character and position of the magistrates. ae, for one, must disclaim all intention of casting upon the magistrates the imputation of being influenced in the granting of licenses by corrupt motives. It nevertheless very frequently happened that in those towns in which political feeling ran high at the elections a suspidon always attached to the oonduct of a magistrate by whom a license was refused, if the applicant happened to be a member of a different party. One witness who had been examined before the committee, for itstance, having stated that to be the care, had given it as his opinion that the ciroumstance Ws not productive of much evil where parties were pretty evenly balanced, but that when the con. trary took plso the licenses weresaid to be granted all in one directiou. The magiatrates were also objects of uspicion, if they had even theilightest intimawith a biewer to those in whose case a license happened to be refused, ana that was aposition he shouldmnaintain, in whichtheyought not to be placed. ie for hisown part, aa magistrate, should wish to be relieved from the perfdrmanoe of a duty which he felt hecouldnotsatisfactor discharge. (Hear, hear.) The next point to which he was anxious to refer was the particular system by which beershops were regulated. That system was generally considered to be a failure, but that opnion must be re rded with some reservation. The history of those establishments dated as far bRck as the year l830,when the Governmentof the day had determined to abolsh the beer duty, and thus to sterifioe a large amount of revenue. But so strongly had the Government felt that the community at large would not be benefited by the reduction of the-duty unless the restrictive sstem of the old publichouses was obviated, that they had deemed it expe dient to legalize the opening of beershops. A strong opposi tion, however, had been offered in committee to the passing of the Bil embodying that proposal by the great brewers, inamuch as, although they had been favourable to the reduction of the duty, they had looked with disfavour upon any attemPttothrowopenthetradein beerto general competition. The Bil, notwit ding their opPition, had pased into a law, andhe might addthat Mr. Calverthad stated it to be his opinion at the time that its operation would lead to she absolute ruin of the great body of licensed victuallers, and to the destruction of the property of the manufactuirers of the article to *hich it related. Butto what property was it, he would ask, that that statement of Mr. Caivert re ferred? Was it meant that the opeiation of the Bill would be to destroy-the plants of the great brewers? No, but their property as the owners of publichouses, which position was by no means legitimately connected with their business as manufacturers of beer. (Hear, hear.) The measure, however, bad not led to the deplorable oonsequences which Mr. Calvert had anticipated, because the great brewers, after all, were doing pretty well at the present day. (" ear, hear," and laughter.) Now, the reduction in the duty on beer having taken place, he was perfectly ready to concur in the proposal that for thi two classes of houses which had since been in existence there should be but one license. There was, indeed, a class of houses in which, as any hon. member who went much about town must be aware, a gass of ale and a sandwich might be had for the small sumtr of 4d.-au economical species of refreshment of which he had in more than one of his walks in the outskirts of the metroplis availed himself with much plesure. (Lauehter.) The proprietors of that class of houses did not, he believed, iesro to have any other license than that which they at preseRt posessd, and he, for one, should not propose to morce a spirit license upon any pern who did not require it. (Hear.) The shell-fishshops came under the same category. There was, for instance, the very excellent oyster shop or Mr. Challoner, in Bell-yard, with which all those who were in the habit of passing by the short cut from Lincolns. inn to the Strand inust be acquainted, and which was also a beershop. He did not think, howvever, that the attractions .,f cysitrs and giun(a laugh) would afford the young Templars in the neighbourhood any greater inducement to frequenit the shop than at present existed, and therefere it might in that case also be considered thata spirit license was unnecessary. e did not therefore, wish that it should be foroed upon the owners of iuch establishments; but be was fully prepared to carry out the recommendation of the dosn mittee, and to give every man of good character who desired it a liense to open a beershop. (HIear, hear.' The evils which were complained of in the petitions which had been presented from the West Riding might, he thought, ver tairly be attributed to the absencs of an efiBcient system of police, and he migbt Temind th e Eousetj ttemgs crates of the West Riding had offered the most strenuous opposition to tho establishment of such a system. (Hear, hear.) He might also observe that the number of instanoes in wLich the owners of beershops had transgressed the law by keeping them open beyond the legal hours was not a fair crterion of the mode in which they were conducted as compared with the publichouses, because the hoars of opening were limited in the case of the latter only one night in the week, while in the case of the former there was a limitation every night in the week. (Hear, bear.) Sir . Mayne had certified that the becrshops in the metropolis were conducted quite as well as the houses of the licensed victuallers, and, taking them as a whole, he (Mr. Seymer) should maintain that no suoh difference prevaled between the two classes of establishments as would justify the House in supporting a system which was opposed to the general commercial polizy of the country. (Hear, hear. The committee had come to the resolution that the sale of intoxicating drinks should be subjected to one uniform lioense and that such license should be issued by the magistrates. Now, as the magistrates were the best judges of th characters of the applicants they might very well be intrusted with a discretionary power in the matter; but he altogether ob- jeted to its being left to the magistrates to determine what' were the vwnts of a particular neighbourhood. To that portion of the Bill before tho House which related to coffeeshops he was disposed to assent, although he regretted that the 'iquestion of their regulation had not been raised' ine, i separto form. The Bill also proposed to 'extend ihe oneration of the Tippling Act, Dut, he mu*say thif'ralthough he did not object to the proposal, he had ilo g"'Wconfidence in its efficacytoputan end to the evl which it w s intended to remove.

Mr. Thomson is to stad their friend when a new license is to be granted- Mr. Lush wa to lend them his aid when informations wore laid against those already licensed." It was clear from thia report of the committee of 1817 that the' liiOnsinl system was devised to protect the moras of the public, and Vxat in this respect it utterly faied. wors still, that it demoralimed all the persons connectql with it. Magistrate4 magstrates clerks, high constables, beadlem, brewers, distllers, wine-merchants, and publi>ns. were all describedin theieport a oorrupted anddemorlizo by thelloensing ystemi,while at the same time th blic were supplied with anadulterated rticle, at a much higher prnce than a genuine artice could have been sold for buon zre-tse principles. The committee of 1854, speaking of the esidence taken before them condemnator, of tie' exercise of the magisterial power inl granting licenses, " The existence of a suspicion that licenses are wSithheld& and granted capriciously, and that the influence of builders Iand brewers is more potent than either the character of the applicant or the requlrements of the public in procurng a incense, weth3er we U founded or not, might affrd sufricient L groundlo having tbemag zit fromdut ich, however greattheir deiare to-do so, it hAs been imposs±blefor them satisfactorily to discharge." It was impossible for magistrates to know the hracter of the applicants for licenses, and there was grave reason to supoe that the power of granting licenses was frequently use for political purposes. It was clear that the jssem did not protect the morals of the community, that it demnoralized all connected with it, and that it was exceedingly injurious to the public. Mr. D. W. arvey, the Chief CoDi. =oner of the city police, said- "A person Sntrsted with tho power of granting lioenses should be independent of local interests, And responsible to a hihher authority, the same as our pclice magistrates I consider the applicnt for a lioense ought to produce bond as aguarantee for gcod conduc. It is no alight test of character if a man who proposes to have a house licensed can find two persons who will be his sureties. After a.man has incurred two or three panalties there ought to be a summary mode by which he can be divested of his licens. I apprehend the lioensed houses and licen#ed beerhouses yr the city are abundantly sfficient to intoxicate the entire population I am not aware there isangthing in the price of the liquor or the acoes tha the pubolc have to it th creates any obstacle to drunkenness, If the pa disposed they can have it under the praeent sistm I do not consider a wel conducted house a nuiusnce. 'I da ot consider the house next door to me a nuisane. 4E nDot consider if the licenses weze doubled in the city it would reqiare an addition of a constable. If the trade was thrown open the numbei of houses at first might incras, but I am of an opidnien that experience would diminish the number afterwards." Ile hoped that hon. members before voting for this BiL would wait and see what the Government intended to do, and he must exprems a strong hope that the Government would themoelves bring in a mease, and not leave in. dependent members to deal with this subject. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NBWDEGATE begged to tender his thanks to the hon. and learned member for Leominsterfor attempting to deal with a great and acknowledged grievauoe (cheers), and hoped he would not succumb to the doctrine that an independent member in bringing forward a measure on such a subject was interfering with the functions of a strong Government. If the present Government were indeed a strong Government why did they not deal with this evil ? (Hear.) He hoped that the magistrates of England would not shrink from the performance of the duties of their station because they might happen to be of an invidious chater. It ppeared to him that the hon. member for Dorsetshire wanted to import into the debate the old strugglebetween the beerhonse keepers and the licensc victuallers, but the real question was whether some system of regulating the evils of the beerhouaesystemshouldnot be adopted. He should vote for the second reading of the Bill. Mr. GRIFIITH should also support the second readin6 although free to consider the details of the BilL He was not enamoured of the particular machinery by which the pubbebouses were regulated under magisterial jurisdiction. lie wished, on the contrary, to relieve the trade as much as possible from any interference of that kind, and if hon. gentlemen who opposed this Bil had been prepared with a Bill of their own, combining the freedom oF trade with due restrictions and regulations for the respectabilty of beer. houses, he should have been inciined to suppoit it. As it was, there vwas no alternative before the %ouse. There were at present two classes of puhlicans-one, under magisterial control, and the other under as little control as possible. There were also two systems-of- inspection, and of police reg^ulton. He should supporit te second raig in the hope of plg th terests concerned upon a mor; permanent and satsfatory footing; but if the Governnm t would bring in a Bil placing the whole of the trade upon a& equal footing in regrd to oommersial regulation and the protection of the Tublic, he should feel a free to support. such amere as ue did to vote for theacod reading of the present BiU. (Hear, hear.) Sir G. GREY.-As a appea ha been 'made to Her Majs Go'ernment by the hon. member for Dorsetshire, who has moved an amendment against the second readinc of this Bi,I feel it due to the hon.'gentleman and to the, House to take an erly opportunity of stting the intention, of the Government with regard to this subject, and moreespecialy in regard to the BiU which the House is, now asked to allow to be read a conda time. (Hear, hear.) I certaly cannot concur in the opinion, that any hon. gentleman who has spoken on this subject has found fault with the hon. member for Leominster for having brought this subject under the notioe of the House (Hear, hear.) On the contrary, X think that hon. member has done good service by taking up this queston, and that this discussion cannot fall to-do good iad to creaW a better understanding of all the beArings of this question. Nor can I agree with the hon. member for North Warwick. shire thit the only question before the House is whethter w shall or shall not exercise a greater onterol over beerhouse.

4;OYY-MABKETand CITY INTETLLIGENCR. Wednesday Evening. The funds opened steadily this morning at the -Emproved quotations of yesterday, and subsequently *xgerienced a further advance, which was not mainiained to the close. The first transactions in Con. sols for the 9th of July were at 93 to k ex dividend, and late in the day, after a large slecullative pn.rchase had been effected, there were buyers at 93*. 1l'he final price, howrever, was again 93 to i. The demand for money continues comparatively moderate, both in the Stock-Exchange and out of doota. iBank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92i io I; New Three per Cents., 922 to i; Indiaibonds, 7s. to 3s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium. Foreign securities were firm, and prices showed a further tendency to improvemnent. Turkish ad-vanced about a half per cent. on purchases, quotaitions being well supported. The Six per Cents. for aroney were negotiated at 954, and ;, and for the account at 95k, i, 1, and . ln the four per Cents. Gunranteed transactions took place at 10)1. The general business comprised-Brazilian, 101); the Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, 100; Peruvian 'hree per Cents., 52k; Russian Five per Cents., for the account, 108i, 1091, and 108X; the Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 97i; Spanish ew Deferred, for account, 25; Spanish Certificates of coupon taot funded, 6i ; ])utch Two-and-a- Half per Cents. 5 and i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 974 The corn-market this morning was steady, at the Rates of Monday. The fiml quotations of the French Three per lento. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. ior money and 68f. 5c. for tho end of the month, ahowing a further recovery of a quarter per cent., -consequent, probably, upon the expectation of a redlction in the rate of discount by the Bank of 'Fiance. A further sum of about 55,0001. out of the recent gold arrivals from Australia was sold to the Bank Io-day. The 249,0001. announced yesterday by the REent reached London this afternoon, and a porIlion of it is expected to be sold to the Bank toinorrow. The letters from Paris to-day assert with great *confidence that the Bank of France will forthwith geduce their rate of interest, which has stood at 6 zper cent. since the 26th of September last. The angnthly return to be published on Friday is relied upon to show that the step has not been prematurely .-ntertained. Looking, however, at the transient mature of each recovery in the stock of specie during sihe past two years, together with the fact that it "was lately, after a short attempt, found dangerous sio leave it to its natural course, the impression is 'unavoidable that if a relaxation has been decided -mpon the hope of producing a feeling of ease at the approaching elections must have been the primary anotive. The probability of a reduction in the rate of dis-count by the Bank of France has suggested the -que3tion whether, in consequence of the recent arrivals of bullion7 a similar course may not be anti-cipated on this side. The latest weekly returns, however, do not warrant the expectation. Had it siot been for the further unfavourable -movement in she Chinese exchanges reported by the last mails a xeduction to 6 per cent. would certainly have been already witnemsed; but, as out of the recent specie arrivals of 2,000,0001. only about 270,0001. sas found its way to the Bank, and some time =.ay now elapse before further large ieceipts take place to supply the constant demand, it seems 'unlikely that any hasty change will be announced. At all events, a short period will most probably be allowed to elapse to test the result of the experiament said to be contemplated by the Bank of France. The lowering of the rate of that establishment to 5 or 5i per cent. may produce an effect -upon the Continental Exchanges, such as to enable a reduction to 6 per cent. to be made in London, without the prospect of its leading to any extra Xressure. Our present rate of 6i per cent. is about I per cent. higher than that at any of the other principal European cities. At Paris the existing icharge of the Bank is 6 per cent., but transactions -are effected in the open market at about 5<. At iRamburg, although the rate after a temporary de-clime has again advanced, it is stil not higher than '. At Berlin, Vienna, and Frankfort it is 5. At Amsterdam it is 4, and at Brussels 3i. Purchases of silver on English account are being actively made in all parts of the Continent, and it appears certain that the next China mail on the 20th inst. will take out the heaviest quantity ever shipped. The suspension of Messrs. Evans, Hoare, and 'Co., a firm largely engaged in the Australian export trade, was announced this afternoon. Their shiprnents, which consisted of beer, wines, and spirits, *are believed to have been on a scale much beyond their available capital, and the prospects of the creditors will, it is presumed, greatly depend upon future advices as to realizations effected. According to some accounts the liabilities of the house amount to 200,0001., but the most reliable estimates place 'them at about 150,0001. At a meeting of the Australian Royal Mail Steam C ompany, held to-day, Mr. 1X. Tootal presiding, lhe report, after a lengthened discussion, was adopted. A general feeling was expressed in favour of winding up, and a suggestion for transferring the T;roperty to a new company, to be formed under limited liability, was not entertained. The directors were urged to give attention to the wishes of the shareholders, and at the close two persons conrected with the shipping interest were associated with the board, to afford advice and assistance in tbhe temporary employment of the vessels. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- " The last time the shareholders were called together was -at the extraordinary general meeting held the 9th of February, to confirm the resolution, previously passed, autho. rizing the board to obtain a supplemental charter which would confer upon the company the general powers of ship. owners, so that, failing a sale of the ships, they might be legally employed i any service which might be approved. ahe supplemental charter obtained from Government in April authorizes this company, incorporated by Royal eha,ter, to do any and all the business of shipowners, with the Iiability of each shareholder limited to the amount of his sbares, while, at the same time, the limited sphere of action allowed by the original charter being extended the future prospects of the company are improved. The present meeting being the annual ordinary general meeting, the directors herewith present to the shareholders the balance.sheet of thre affairs of the company up to the 13th of May last, the usual date to which the books have been made up and closed. The present board of direntors were elected for the purpose of I winding up' the affairs of the company, and, beeping this object in view, they havo as far as possible closed all agencies and open accounts, getting quit atthesametimeof stationsanddeptds abroad. From that inie the board have done all in their power to effect sales of the vessels in every available quarter, but hitherto not one otffer of purchase has been made on terms which the legal advisers of the company could recommend should be accepted. The shareholders were informed in the report, dated June, 2&i5, that the agencies at Sydney, Adelaide, and the Caps of Good Hope were closed, but the Melbourne agency and ]ort Philip coal dep6t, owing to the bankruptcy of Broadfoot, Bonar, and Co., of Melbourne, they were unable *n close. That estate is not yet wound up. One dividend of 9d. in the pound has been declared, fand a 2urther small dividend is expected shortly; but hitherto nothing has been received here. The amount of the comysuy's claim against Blroadfoot, Bonar, and Co. is 5,94U. nih regard to the Ring George's Sound agency the direct'us have to report that this account is closed in the hooks, the Eulropean and Australian Roysl MIail Company of Glasgow remaining debtors for the halance for which the coals 'were sold to them, ijJOOI. having in October last been recive onaun>s ±Ae staon plnt mahney & vwere included in tho sale. The St Vincent (Caps Verd) agency is in the same condition as that at King George's ;iuund everything connected with it having been transferred to the European and Australian Company of Glas=ow. 2o far, then, as praoticable the present board have fulled the duties for which they were apeinted. They have alo from time to time obtained employment in the transport service, proving the efficiency and seaworthiness of the vessels, and earning in the net funds sufficient to return to the shareholders 92,3371., and have kept the vessels in good Drder and repair, paying contingent expenses, when not in nse, of dock dues, &e., and discharging many old outstanding claims. The supplemental charter having been obtained the directors, in fulflment of the statements and assurances unade at the last meeting, now give the opportunity of a reronstraction of the board, and it is for this meeting to decide not only what shall be done with the vessels, but the mumber of directors which shall constitute the board and the shareholders who shall be chosen to undertake the mnanagement. In April an opportunity offered of obtaining Government employment for three of the vessels, and the Sydney, Australian, and Adelaide sailed on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of May respectively to Malta, to convey troops to (;ibraltar and England. They are expected home in a few -days. The Victoria Jemains in the Victoria Docks. With regard to the Admiralty accounts there is now in the books -to their debit the sum of 11,4581., consisting of certain items at present in dispute. Respecting the claim upon the insurance offices for the fire on board the Adelaide, to which allusion was made in the last report, the directors are happy to state that it h'-a been satisfactorily adjusted and the amouants received.")

The atock of specie held by the Scotch and Iri banks during the month ending the 9th of May was 4,085,8471., being an increase of 7,5891. as compared with the previoua return, and an increase of 304,0231. when compared with the corresponding period last year. The Liverpool cotton-market has been very active to-day, at an advance of 1-16d. to id. upon the rates of last week. This is attributed to an increase of firmness observable ini the Manchester markets. Regarding the latter, the following is from a circular of Messrs. Heugh, Balfour, and Co.:- "U Up to the end of May the languor ofthe generaldemand forced on an inorease of 'short time,' which is beginning to tell on stocks and prices. During last week there was more business done than is usual during the Whitsuntide holy. days, and the improvement hs been more manifest to-dayThe diminution of stocks and production is giving sellers a nearer approach to a command of the market thin they have had for a mong time. Some desoriptions of goods and some counts of shipping yarns are becoming searce, and for im. mediate delivery very fullprices are paid. "Cotton has been dull, but has revived again, and It is now rather dearer than it was a month ago. 4 change from long-continued easterly winds brought unusually heavy arrivals into Iiiverpool, and at thb same time the holydays here, together with the increase of ' short time,' gave ' the trade' the means of keeping well out of the market. The raw material has been strong enough, however, to bear these trials, and looks now as unpromising for spinners as it has done at any time this year. It seeoms quite a reasonable expectation that we shall sce rather higher p-rioes, both in L'rerpool and here if the weather shall continue as favourable for the growing crops as lt has lately been, even aJl. though we should not have a cheaper money-mnarket;* but if the Bank should be enabled to loweritszrate then we may surely anticipate a decided advance."

T'H P1rBLIC HAr7MlT. (From the PReira-General's Weekly Return.) The returns for the week that ended on Saturday, 3Tne 6, exhibit the gratifying fact tiat the remarkably "ina t number of 868 deaths w&w registered in that period it London. There hs been a constant decreme of mortality aiAcs< the temperature rose, and in the first 'week of June th, deaths ire about 200 less than they were in- the first week of May. In the ten years 187-56 the average nutmber or deathis in the week corresponding with list week was 979. But, as the deaths of lat week occurrd in an. increased population, the averagle, 'With a view to com_ parson, must be rased in proportion to the increase, and in this case itwill become 1,077. The resultis tha thedeath, noe retumed are lesg by 209 than the average rate of mortality at this period of the year would have'prodaced. [ MM the firstweek ef June, 154, the deaths were 786,;In that of 1860 they were 8f; and these furnih the' onlyinistance, in corresponding weeks In which the deaths were not more numerous than those 'of last week, thoujh ecih succesive. yeir has added to the number of persons liying 'within the bills ofimortality. The deaths frorm the zymotic class of diseases, which in thq preiofis weoek, weroel81, were last week 170.' Of the, sixrprineipal dieises in this class diarrhoea alone shows a, tendency to increase, the cases iz which it was -fatal having been in the last three weeks 12, 17, and 26; Summer cholera has made its appearance as- Usual;' and four deaths are referred to it under-the designation "English cholera," " cholera infantum," or " choleraic diarrhieo." A severe case of this oomplaint manifested itself in St. Ann-street, Limehouse, where a man, 26 years of age, died after a daysi iless. Smallpox was fatalin only one case, which occurred. in Deptford. Measles carried off 24 children, but the only parts in *iich it seems to be more fatal than uual are ths Goswell-street and City-road subadistricts, in each of which.- four deaths from it-are returned. The deaths from hooping. cough were 47, of which 5 occuzred in the Rectory sub-district, Marylebone. The deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory organ . were last week 125; the corrected average is 131. Those from bronchitis, which a few weeks ago were 100 or more, have declined to 53. Only 3 persons whose deaths are returned had attained the age of 9( years or upwards. Two women were 93 years old; and a widow died in Hereford-street, Marylebone, at the great age of 96 years. Last week the birthp of 774 boys and 768 girls, in all 1,512 children, -were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1S47-56 the average number was 1,497. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 877 in. The highest. reading 'w 2999 in. on the morning of Thursday. The megn temperature of the week was 60 6°, which is nearly 4' higher than that of the previous week, and 3-9° above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temporature was more or less above the average on every day of the week excep.- Monday, and the excess on zriday and Saturday was 10° and I11. The mean dew-point temperature was 51°, and the difference -between this and the mean air temperature was 9V6. The highest reading of the thermometer in the sun was 106.7°, which occurred on Friday. The mean tamperature of the water of the Thames was 62"; on Saturday the.temperature of the river rose to 64-7°. The wind&'wasin the noreh-estonthefirst two days; afterwards it was for the most part in the south-west. Rain fell to the, amount of 0 23 in., most of which fell in the afternoon of' Satrdy. __ _ _ _ _ _

ZO&DON, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1857. In the House of Commons yesterday, on the order for the second reading of the Sale of Beer Bill, moved by Mr. HARDY, Mr. K. SEYMER moved to defer the second readiDg for six months. He argued that the Bill would st1i further restrict au already restricted trade; that tbere was an indisposition on the part of maagistiates to grant licenses, and that licenses were refused in many instances to applicants of good character. He showed what from his own observation appeared to be the nature and operation of the licensinog system, which was opposed to the general commercial policy of the country, referring to cases and to evidence indicating the connexion between brewers and licensed publichousew, and its tendency to establisha monopoly. Bedenied that morality was any gainer by the system, which, moreover, according to the evidence, did not prevent adulteration by dilution on the part of publicans. It had been said that the beershops had failed; but the object of the law of 1830 was to give the public the benefit of the re,duction of duty, which they would not otherwise bave had, and in that respect they had not failed. He urged the Government to deal with this question, and to deal with it fearlessly. This amendment was seconded by Mr. W. Biowr. Mr. NZWDEGATF supported the second reading of the Bill, looking at tlhe question as not one between publicholuses and beershops, but whether any syatem 'or regulating beerahops should be adopted. Mr. GRBY7= likewise supported the second reading. Sir G. GBBY said that to the principle of the Bill, which was the repeal of the Act of 1830, by which the beer trade wvas thrown open, and a return to the former law, he entertained the very strongest objection. The subject had been inquired into by committees in both Houses of Parlament, and in none of their reports appeared any recommendation that the Act of 1.830 should be repealed. He thought, therefore, that the House ought to be cautious in acceding to the second reading of a Bill -which subverted the principle of that Act and adopted a retrograde policy. It appeared in evidence that drunkenness throughout the country generally baddecreased, and hebelieved thattheevils connected with beerhouses arose from a defective administration of the law, not from defects in the law itself. The system of licensing at present, according to the evidence, did not sufficiently protect public morality. In answer to the appeal of Mr. K. SB2stan he stated that during the recess he would give his best attention to a measure for placing publichouses and beerhouses under more effectual control, and, without pledging the Goverment to the course it would be disposed to take, he thought the power and the obligation of magistrates to revoke icenses, not from the person, but from the house, should le increased. After some observations from Mr. KENDALL and MIr. PACER, Mr. HARDY defended the Bill and replied to objections. He cited a nassage from the report of the committee of that House which expressly declared that the beershops had failed, and he described the evils of the system now in existence, and of allowing an unlimited temptation to excess by the multiplication of these houses. If a restriction should be imposed, unless he gave a discretion to magistrates, he did not knowv to whom he should give it. He did not desire to extend monopoly or to abridge the comforts of the poor; he only desired to savethe labouring classes from the demoralizing influence of beerhouses. He considered the charge against magistrates of favouritism as vague; but he did not object to arming the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor with additional power to dismiss a magistratewho failed inthe administration of thelaw. Although he admitted that no committee had recommended the repeal of the law of 1830, the question was whether the evidence did not justify that course. Drunkenness, tt was true, had not increaaed, but juvenile crime had increased, and this increase was, in his opinion, to be traced to beerhouses. The simple question was whether a system should be reverted to which could be more satisfactorily carried out than in 1830, whereby something would be done toWards abating a great evil and improving the public morals without interfering very materially with vested interests. Mr. VILRIM, as chairman of the committee of 1853, explained its objects, which MIr. H.ARDY, he said, had not correctly stated, as the result of the evidence, and he spoke in condemnation of the BilL. General THosrrsoN spoke briefly against the second reading of the Bill, and Mr. BARPow rn it, favour. Upon a division the amendment was carried by 213 to 180; so the bill is lost. Mr. L. KING moved the secoRd reading of the Property Qualification Bill. Sir G. GREY, observing that it was the general understanding that all measures whEich affected the representation of the people should be postponed until a future session, moved to defer the second reading for six months. The debate which ensued turned entirely upon the question whether the measure should be postponed or proceeded with. Upon a division, Sir G. GBEY's amendment was camed by 204 to 145, so that this BiU is likewise lost. On the order for the second reading of the Election Expenses Bill, Lord R. GRO8vMoR said, for the reason just assigned by the Government, in which he acquiesced, he did not intend to go on with the Bill this session. He moved to discharge the order. This motion, after a few words from Mr. Du CANE, was agreed to. Mr. T. Duico,n=s, for the same reason, withdrew his Bill for the Registration of Voters. The Scientific and Literary Societies Bill was read a second time. The other orders having been disposed of, the House adjourned at half-past 5 o?clock.
In accordance with the principles of Free Trade as well as the result of many years' experience, the House of Commons yesterday rejected Mr. HARaDY's Bill for a return to a strieter monopoly in the sale of spirits and beer. Such a fate might have been expected from the first for a measure which was not only opposed to the spirit of all recent legislation, but was in direct contradiction to the Report of the Committee which sat during nearly the whole Sessions of 1853 and 1854. Certainly the public sobriety and morality ought to be well assured in return for such a commercial anomaly as the present licensing system-a system which the Bill of Mr. HARDY proposed to make still more severe and onerous. If Temperance Societies confessed that the lieensing of publichouses acted as a kind of Maine Law, and that wherever the magistrates were rigid and the brewers omnipotent there drunkenness was rare, and health, wealth, and contentment reigned; if the clergy and the Poor Law authorities declared that a restriction on the sale of liquids elevated public morality and prevented destitution, then we might have some encouragement to persist in a course by which great advantages were attained in return for obvious sacrifices of theory. But who has a word to say in favour of the present practice ? Who can discover any social benefit to redeem the economical heresy ? The principle on which the license system is based is simply this-that the authorities shall take due care for the regulation of houses of entertainment. Places where men meet to drink are apt to be scenes of rioting and profigacy, the resort of the gambler and the thief. The magistrates of a district should, then, take care that no permission Is granted to sell strong drink except to a man for whose character there is some guarantee. On this principle, sound enough in itself, has been built up a fabric of inconvenience and injustice. The spirit of interference with social habits which distinguished legislation in past times, which produced sumptuary laws and laws for the minute regulation of trade, has thoroughly penetrated every part of the licensing system. The magistracy pretend to take care of the public sobriety, to know the public wants, to determine what number of houses are necessary to a certain population, and in what manner the business of a publican should be carried on. The consequence has been, not the limitation in number of the publichouses, nor the improvement of such as exist, but the establishment of a monopoly in the hands of a few brewers of colossal wealth. The licenses have been confessedly granted on no fixed principle. In some parts every tenth house is a ginshop; in others two or three streets are confined to one dirty and ill-conducted establishment. It is evident that the object of a license is to secure a landlord of good character, but under ithe present system the magistrates have thought more of the house than the master. Instead of making the license a purely personal affair, they have practically granted it to certain houses, which retain it under any ohange of proprietors or lessees. Thus, while a man of the best charaoter and the most ample means is refused permission to open a new house, the old ones are transferred from respectable to disreputable landlords, from solvent dealers to bankrupts, almost as a matter of coursA. The fittest person for the supply of a distdct may-be ;ef used leave to trade because he will not take one of the established houses from some rich brewer on the latter's own terms, while blacklegs, prizefighters, and wo-se find no difficulty in getting their license, though without means or character, because the place they have taken is on the list of those already licensed. The result might be foreseen. The houses, and consequently the sale of beer and Bpirits, have become a monopoly, and the longest purse has gained most by the abuse. The publicans are confessedly to a great extent the mere agents of the brewers, from whom they are obliged to purchase their liquor, and whose influence may unmake, as it has made them. Tha sway of one or two great firms is said to extend over large districts of the metropolis. The BEDFORD estate or the GROSVTNOR estate is not a greater wonder than the property of some of these colossal establishments in licensed places of entertainment. All the evils of monopoly are thus incurred without any of the benefits of regulation. Gin flavoured with turpentine and porter made frothy with coccuMus Indicus are evils not counterbalanced by any necessary respeciability in the landlords who vend them. The great majority of these we wiU allow to be honest and respectable men, but this is not the result of the licensing, and would equally be the case if there were no licenses at all. Now, these facts being known and pretty generally acknowledged, it would have been a bold thing at any time to bring in a BiU for throwing the trade more completely into the power of the brewers, and their allies, the magistrates. But in the present case the confidence shown by Mr. AsaDy is pre-eminently surprising, since, as Mr. W. BRbvwN told the House, a Committee, after sitting two sessions and asking 15,000 questions on the subject, had come to conclusions exactly opposite to those which the Bill embodied. The Commaittee of 1854 had declared that there existed suspicions that "licenses are withheld and granted "capr ciously; that the influence of builders and "brewers is more potent than either the character "of the applicant or the requirements of the "public ;" and, without endorsing these accusations, it considered them sufficiently important to justify tho abolition of the present system. Hlaving in view the impossibility of magistrates knowing the character of the applieants or the wants of the district, the Committee was in favour of granting a license, revocable for misconduct, to every man who could procure sureties for good behaviour. By these means the monopoly, the jobbing, the favouritism, and the injustice of the present practice would at once be brought to an end. Some such plan must, we think, soon be accepted by the Legislature. There can be no reason why the trade in beer and spirits should not be as free as any other. A sum may be charged for a license greater in the case of spirits than of malt liquor; that is simply a tax for the benefit of the revenue, and makes no difference in the principle. But, as long as we allow that liquor should be sold at all, we must allow that every man has a right to sell it. The freeer the trade becomes the more respectable will be the class of men who embark in it, and more will be gained by delivering the public from millionaire brewers and dependent retailers than by the strictest system of supervision that the sskill of a Bench of Justices ever devised. The present state of things certainly has little to recommeud it. If ever there was a system which failed completely, it is that which now prevails. Much drunkenness among the people, much bad liquor at the publichouses, and many bankruptcies among the landlords, are its chief features. If, then, it neither insures wholesomeness in the drink, temperance in the drinkers, nor respectability in the dealers, it is time it were superseded by some regulation more reasonable and more promising of success.
A notice was given by Mr. RoBuocx on Tuesday night, that on that day week he would move the following resolution in the House of Commons:"That, in the opinion of this House, the office of "Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland ought to be abo"lished, and a fourth Secretay of State appointed." Here, then, is a revival of the old question which. has been so often mooted and so often shelved. With the exception of the Dublin tradesmen, there are few who would not gladly hear that the mock sovereignty in Ireland bad been abolished. When our political relations with Ireland were other than they are now; when the means of communication between the two countries were tedious and uncertain; when portions of Ireland were still wild and unvisited by civilized man, it was intelligible that there should be a high officer of State on the spot, armed with all the powers of the executive Government. Does any such state of things now exist? The electric telegraph leaps swift as thought, and swifter than utterance, from London to Dublin, and from Dublin to all parts of Ireland. Great Britain has a complete system of railroads. The packet service between Holyhead and Kingstown is accomplished in a very few hours; Ireland, too, is covered with iron ways, so that the most perfect facility of communication exists between all important points of the sister kingdoms. If a disturbance should arise at any point in eitherof the islands, the force necessary for its repression could be drawn from any other point, and be concentrated where danger was in twelve hours after notice received. This constitutes the first ground for the abolition of the Irish Lieutenancy. There is not, however, any portion of the QuE's dominions more tranquil than Ireland, or more likely to remain so. There is, then, no furthernecessityfor thepresence atDublin of a representative of Royalty, who, whatever his civil functions might be, was in reality for centuries rather an " Impeiator" than anything else. There is the strongest possible improbability, we say, that disturbance will again occur in Ireland; but, should this expectation be unhappily disappointed, the forces of the empire could, without the intervention of any special officer, be brought to bear upon the threatened spot with so much rapidity that the necessity for an Irish Viceroy on this score has ceased to exist. But, again, if we do not require a QuxNx's representative at Dublin as a chief constable, neither is his presence there necessary as a purveyor of intelligence. Time was when it was really a matter of vast importance to the State that we should have an Ambassador in Ireland-we called him Viceroy-who should keep the authorities at the centre of affairs correctly informed as to the state of parties in Ireland, as to the causes of existing diEcontents, as to the condition of agriculture, and many other matters of the like kind. The advantages of the Viceroyalty. however, even in this respect, have passed away. The local newspapers, the discussions in Parliament, in which the Irish meembers take so prominent a share, the constant succession of tourists in Ireland, the total cessation of al secret conspiracies and cabals, and the rapid growth of the Irish railway system, are all excellent reasons why we should recall oar Viceregal envoy. It would be as rational to leave a lighthouse standing in the midst of a reclaimed and well-drained district from which the sea has receded as to maintain au Irish Viceroy any longer for the purpose of supplying us with intelligence. It may, however, be said that, granting we no longer require the services of such an officer either to check disturbance or afford us information, yet that his presence operates to smoothe dowa many asperities, and to conciliate offended politicians, who, but for the Viceregal influence, might be converted into bitter opponents of the Imperial Government. We are perfectly ready to admit the important part that well-timed courtesies and judicious dinners play in the system of constitutional government. An long as human beings are susceptible of offence, real or imaginaryas long as they are apt to overrate their owvn merits, and to underrate the claims of their rivals, it will be important to keep them in good humour. We are not speaking of statesmen and patriots, who will serve their country for their country's sake, nor even of hard-headed men of the world, who require more solid diet than a smile and a regret; but of the great mass of mankind as we find them, who wince under neglect, and contrive to resent personal pique on public grounds. It may be said without offence that our Irish fellow-subjects are at least as thin-skinned as any other race of men, and as much in need of timely conciliation. The simple fact, however, is that no man among them who is of any political significance now attaches importance to Viceregal courtesies. They will naturally come to head-quarter. A Royal " command" to Buckinghain Palace has taken the place in their aspirations of an invitation to " the Castle." They have precisely the same desires, and endeavour to satisfy them in precisely the same way as we do ourselves-and they are right. The great Irish families will naturaly come to London for the season, because it is the seat of empire-because it is the centre of "s ociety"-because it is the great clearing-house of the world-and, finally, because it is the real capital of Ireland. Of what consequence is it, then, as a matter of State policy, that a representative of Royalty should at Dublin conciliate a small set of the third and fourth-rate Irish nobility, and dupe the commercial inhabitants of that pleasant city into the belief that "they are received at Court?" Nor is this transference of power from Dublin to London the result of any farsighted or perfidious policy of the Imperial Government. The first engineman and stoker who drove a locomotive upon British soil have had far more to do with the event than aU the statesmen who have conducted Irish affairs since the first iron-fisted Norman Baron stepped ashore for the first time upon Irish ground. The only argument which can be urged with any colour of reason in favour of this outworn pageant is, that the Irish themselves attach some importance to it. Is this so ? There is little doubt that a petition for leaving this pasteboard crown upon the head of disconsolate Erin might readily enough be got up among the Dublin tradesmen, and we do not at all depreciate the personal popularity of the present amiable LORD-LEUTEANAT among al classes of the people. The question, however, is of the office, not of the man, and, as a fact, we believe the bulk of the Irish nation regard the Viceroyalty and its incidents with indifference, and would feel, on hearing of its abDlition, only regret that they would now lose in Dublin the presence of an excellent and most courteous nobleman. It has, indeed, often been urged by many of the more intelligent of the Irish members that the Viceroyalty is not only not a benefit to the country, but, on the contrary, a positive disadvantage. They say the Castle is the centre of a hundred petty intrigues, which would not exist if the Casfle were not there. It is, of course, difficult for us to say, were we Irishmen, what our feelings would be, but it would seem difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Viceroyalty is the badge of provincialism. We should not like to have aViceroy set over us in England for the district nort h of the Trent. Our Scotch fellowsubjects would not be particularly gratified by the presence of such a functionary in Edinburgh Castle. It is natural that there should be some officer of State, with unusual powers, in the distant portions of the QuEEN's dominions, as in the Canadas, in Australia, and in British India; but why keep up such an office at home when all reality has long since departed from it? We believe that ninetenths of the hIish would feel the extinction of this now unmeaning pageant as a compliment and a relief. It would be needlees to point out the advanatages that would result from the simplification of a divided administration. To place Ireland at once for all purposes of administration in the same position as Scotland is just one of the useful bits of reform that Lord PAT:N'RSTOx, with the strong majority at his back, might readily effect.
Whatever good qualities our English and Irish Roman Catholics poEsess, they seem certainly to be deficient in prudence and common sense. Whenever there is anything ill-judged, unseasonable, or in bad tast4 'to be said or done, they are sure to say or do it. Their minds, with consistent perversity, seem to run counter to all the prepossessions of their countrymen. Catholic opinion forms a kind of backwater by the side of the great stream of public feeling. Watch the knot of Catholic Peers in onie House, and the clique of Catholic Members in the other, and you will find exactly the course of conduct which a sensible politician ought to avoid. Intemperance when there should be moderation, and vacillation when there should be firmness, want of principle combined in strange unison with want of tact, the jargon of religious liberty joined to a defence of intolerance in its worst forms, an affectation of religious enthusiasn, together with a disposition to flatter and talk the language of any sect which can serve them for the monment,-such are the distinguishing characteristics of Catholic legislators in the present day. No wonder that they have decreased in number and influence, that Ireland only mends 34 and Great Britain only one to the new House of Commons, and that this small body iis of still smaller consequence in the eyes of Parliament and the country. But, as if determined not to learn wisdom, Catholics stiU persevere in their policy of separation and obstructiveness. Exeter-hall could not wish them worse than that they should often assemble at such meetings as that which we described yesterday, and utter sentiments so opposed to the principles on which they obtained their own liberties. Unmindful of their own arguments and their own protestations, the Catholics, both hereditary and converted, seem willing to prolong the ten years' struggle of the Jews for political rights, if by so doing they can assert their own importance and show their Dower in hindering the progress of a Bill. If we wrong them by this accusation, they have only themselves to thank-, for the result of such a movement as they have begun can only be to diminish the majority by which the measure now before Parliament will le carried without conferring any advantage on the Catholics themselves. According to the Relief Act of 1829, an Oath was framed to be taken by Catholics before sitting in either House. The terms of this Oath we are not about to defend; nay, we can see much reason in the opinion of those who declare that aU political swearing is useless, and, consequently mischievous. If TAILEYRAND swore to thirteen constitutions, and many a living Frenchman has sworn to four or five, these politicians of a revolutionary country have only followed the exanple .set by our own statesmen in the evil days of England. We can quite believe what some Catholics ar fond of bosting,-thgthe existence of the present Oith makes no diffexop in their political conduct; but still thee things We beside the question. The Oath of 1829 was agreed upon by Parliament as necesary, and was accepted by the Catholic leaders of the period. For nearly thirtyyears it has been no bar to the freedom of voting and debate in either House. There can be no pretence for saying that tbe Catholics feel any real grievance, or that, but for the present opportunity, they would have come forward to demand any change in the law. But suddenly, and as if by an afterthought, they attempt to hang an agitation on the skirts of a measure for accomplishing a totally different object. A passage in the Oath of Abjuration excludes Jews from sitting in PAlianient, and this exclusion calls attention to the general question of the Oaths taken by non-Catholic members. It is not assered or even suspected, by the most zealous loyalist, that Churchmen or Presbyterians, Baptista or Methodists, Unitarians or Jews, are likely to fail in their allegiance to the British CRow2r, or to desire the introduction of a rival supremacy. Hence an alteration in the Oaths is of little importance, and, except for the prejudice of a clas against the Hebrew race, a Bill to make such an alteration would pass without any opposition. But any loosening of the hold which the terms of the Catholic Oath is supposed to have on Catholics is a matter which must move the deepest feelings of large classes, and, especiallyafterthe events of 1850, be treated asa matter of State policy, to be dealt with cautiously and after due deliberation. What, then, has been the course of the Government ? To do what we think common sense and a desire to remove Jewish disabilities naturally prompts- to change the form of the Oath for non-Catholics, a change which involves only one vexed question, that of Jewish admission, and to leave untouched the Catholic Oath, any proposal for a change in which would violate the compact of 1829. Now, the Catholics have all along professed their desire to seejustice done to Jews, as to others; theirproper course, then, evidently must be to waive obtruding their particular claims or wishes, and to join in passing a Bill which, as it only relates to non-Catholics, maakes no difference in their own position, and, in fact, has no more to do with them than if it regulated Eindoo marriages or the operations against the slave trade. But no,-scarcely has the Bill been brought before Parliament with a fresh prospect of success than the Catholics, English and Irish, pretend to discover a grievous wrong in being left in the position they have occupiedcsince the Emancipation Act. The country is threatened with a new opposition to the Jewish Disabilities Bill, unless there be incorporated with it clauses overthrowing the settlement of 1829. In the fervour of their religious feelings the Romish leaders forget the liberal language which they have been accustomed to use for more than a generation. Mr. MAGeumI would have his revenge on the Jews for taidng part in the national display of feeling at the time of the Papal Aggression. So, in effect, say the Duke of NoRs-oLx and some 30 or 40 noblemen and gentlemen. Unlessthe Pnusnn choose to risk thesuccess of a long-deferred measure by mixing up with it all the bitter controversy of 300 years, the Romanist body of these kingdoms more than hint an intention of obstructing all further efforts in the cause of religious liberty. We ourselves certainly have no objection to a change in the Catholic Oath, or, indeed, to the abolition of it altogether. If a form of words could be framed so wide as to admit men of aU religions equally, or if a special Oath were to be administered to the Jews omitting the words of which they complain, there would, we think, be little oppositioi from the liberal part of the community. But a large body of iOur people are not liberal, and the Roman Catholics least of all. With the aggressive spirit and the tendency to boasting and display which mark the Romanist, and with the strong anti-Popish instincts of nine-tenths of the English nation, there can be no doubt that any attempt to tamper with the Oath of 1829 would be the beginning of a fierce religious controversy. The Catholics take the opportunity of a Jewish Disabilities Bill to assert their elaims to equality and confidence; let the Mlinister acquiesce, and the first boast of their more zealous spirits would be, that they had gained free scope for the assertion of their religion's supremacy. All this might prove to be harmless, and end, as it began, in words, but what would be the effect on the national feeling ? What would be the result for the Minister and the measure he was proposing ? We can only advise the more sensible Roman Cathol:cs to refrain from forcing their alleged claims on public notice, so as to hinder the settlement of a question of which every one wishes to be rid.

They are able and willing to pay for instruction, plenty of which is brought into the market to meet their demand; but they are often painfuly conscious of the diiculty to an unpractised judgment of recognizing the genuine article. That there is almost a clamorous need for the asistance of some competent authority in this par. ticular is rendered highly probablo, if it be not conclusively proved, by the number and variety of the bodie3 which are coming forward to offer their aid in testing the education impartcd at middle-clas Febools, and putting the "guinea stamp" upon that which is worthy to nasa current. The Committee of Privy Council are coniinually tempted to deviate on this side from the regular round of their duties, by baving it forced upon their notice that advice is in request which they are capable of affording. The Society of Arts has met with an encouraging reception for its offer to test by examination the acquirementa of the jpupils of mechanics' institutions. And now the Uni. versity of Oxford, shortly to be followed no doubt by Cambridge, has started a scheme for conferring titles of diatinction on *1U young mren who may establish their merit by submitting to examination at the hands of a competent board appointed by the University. As a further evidence of the wide extent of the movement, it may be mentioned that this scheme itself is confessedly formed upon a provincial model, its originator informing us that he has followed the plan of an agricultural society in Devonshire, which has begun to give an educational turn to its activity. The part which the old universities are likely to take inthis work is certainly a fresh and marvellous instance of the elasticity of our institutions. A total revolution of opinion in regard to popular learning has taken place almost under the eyes of the present generation; and Osford and Cambridge, from being the strongholds of the exclusive and restrletive doctrine, are quietly preparing to take the lead in meeting the new requirements of the time. A great deal is indicated by this decision. It constitutes for the universities the choice between being the cherished leaders of a privileged class, or the respected and powerful guides of the eitire nation. They mnst be nnderstood to have chosen the latter destiny; and, from this beginning, there is no possibility of laying down the limits within which their influeboe and usefulness may expand. They begin now, though imEroeptibly anud noiselessly, a new chapter of their career. he pride which would inevitably have consiened them to dignified repose in a few years has yielded to the counsels of true sagacity. Though they will continue, of course, to fight against the popularization of their favours one atter another, they have by this step assented to the principle that the hon,rur of academical connexion with them may be sought by classes which are neither orthodox nor wealthy. A few shilings will cover the fees to be paid for admission to the OxfoTd examinations and for taking out the diplomna %hich they grant; and no inquiry is to be made into the ieligious kDowledge of the candidate, except by express desire It is bardh 'possible to overrate the signifcance of thee detils. Since the great universities ceesed to be popular ssstituti(,ns a wide change has come over the halits and thouights of English soviety. The universities, Uitil withiD very recent years, have remained practically unchavged. They had to decide whether they would retain t.he theoretical perfection of their early days at the expense of a total disseveran,ce from the affairs ot the living nation, or wht tber they would have the highest edQcatioinal iiluencb in the counttry on condition of lowering their preju dices 4Fori' the lhorel spirit of the age. lf they may he judged froml their present disposition, they prefer life to death ; ad,d shobuld such really be the case, th2ere can he nO ,.uiit that tha revard of -their wisdom itril hw both splendirl ant1su hstai,tial,-Monc)heEter G'uardioa.

Dovpm, Wednesday, June 10.-His Royal Eighne, Prince Frederick of Prussia arrived at Dover this evening ratner unexpectedly. It was not generaly known that his Royal Highness was about to 'visit England so soon, but on the arrival of Mlajor-General Wylde from the Palac and an aUach6 of the Prussian Legtion at Dover this afernoon the rumour epread that the Prince ws coming, and, short as was the notice, the pierheads and the Admiral pier were speedily thronged wth spectator3, anxious to wel. come a prtnce who is shortly to be so closely allied to the Royal Family of England. Every preparation had been made by the railway authorities for the comfort of the Prinee. A. special train consisting of a Stateearriage for the use of his Royal Highness and suite, with carrege for tbe servants, had been kept in readiness from 5 p.m. Eis Royalllighness arrived at the Admiralty-pier onbhoard the Princess Maude, South-Eastern steampacket, at 6.15 p.m. and wvas wrmly cheered on landing. The special train left Dover en routc for Windsor at 6.51 p.m. ST. BAntowooniw's Hospnrr.-A very crowded convcrjzione was held in the hal of this noble institutiononTuesday evening, on the invitation of Mr. W. Forster White, the treasurer. The hall was most profusely deoorated with photographs of the gems in the AtTreasures Exhibition, water-colour drawingsA plate, &c., while on tables raunning throughout the hail were some beautiful photographs of distingoished statesmen and others by hyall, stereoscopes, with views and fancy groups, microscopes, &c. The latter were principally exhibited by Miess. Salmon and Co., and some of the objects shown were shost interesting, such as the toDgue of a gnat, the head of a fly, the leaf of a flower, the foot of a frog, a drop of water, &c., in wlhich the wonders of nature we made most manifest. But perhaps the most interesting exhibition in the room waa that exemplifyig the artificial production of salmon. Thus was shown the ova preserved in gelatine, which, after being placed in a river, produces ina fewwee}s the most minute of the fish tribe, from whence it takes the form of what is called parr, a fish not exceeding three or four inches in length, at which it continues for 12 or 15 months, wLen it changes its scales so as to protect it from the action of the salt water, when it makes to sea, returning to its native waters in about six weeks a noble fish of I5lb. or 201b. weight; and, should it remain unmolested, again, in the following year, it goes to sea, returning once more as noble a fish as ever graced a Royal board, the largest fish exhibited last night being about three feet long and 10 or 12 inches broad. The inspection of these specimens eoold not fail to produce speculations as to how much may be done by a little judicious regulation with regard to fishing in certain waters at fixed periods of the year, to produce for the public an immense supply of a dainty and wholesome food at moderate prices. So successful, indeed, is the artificial breeding of salmon become in France that, whereas a few years ogo it was difficult to procure this fish in Pins for les than 3s. or 4s. per lb., it has this season been seling as low as 6d. per lb. POPLAR HosPITA.-The first festival on behalf of this hospital was held yesterday evening at the London Tavern. Mr. Thomas Biring, hLP., vice-president, was in the chair, and was supported by Mr. Ayrton, M.P.. Mr. C-urney, MP., hlr. R. Green, Mr. C. E. Wigram, Mr. E. Bunsen, MIr. R. H. Fowler, Mr. Barclay, Captain Paget, Mr. J. D. Powles. Mr. Charrington, and many other gentlemen connected with the banking and shipping interests of the country. After the usual loyal toasts, the chairman propeedthe toast of the evening, "Prosrity to the Poplar iospital" Ie admitted that the establishment of a new hospithl in a locality where such an institution aready existed was only to be justified by special circumstances. The immense increase of every description of trade and manufacture connected with the commerce and shipping of London had cansed the concentration of avast nutnber of persons in the district of Poplar, nearly the whole of whom were following trades which peculiarly exposed them to severe and distressing accidents. The doors of the hosital [wvere open to all cases of accident.The accienmmod;tion at present provided was for 28 patients, and the I rciety had arrived at s, time when tbey felt iustified in callasg upon the shiPowrnerS, blerchants, brolkers, and every class of the general public to aid the in.- stitution.

MANCIBSTER ABT TBEASUBES EXHIBITION. (Continued from 2U Times of Juno 4) aQ if to throw into more marked relief t{he colossa 0OXiO of Ruben,, Nlorthern art, when he rose to re vivify it, had shrunk imto canvases of the narrow63t dimensions and bridled its gand to the mo delicate Onipultion. Adam Elheieer, of livankort <157o-1620), had followed in the track of Patenier, snd had acquired a great reputation at Rome by his mall andhghly-finished landscape,elaborated with -a patience wthich, notwithstanding the painter's Mopulaeity, barely enabled him to ear4 a lvelihood, to salow was the rate of his production. " The DeIivery of St. Peter'" (809), and " The Adoration of -the Infant Saviour" (520), will enable the visitor to Manchester to appreciate the miniature-like deli.nacy of this painter. Like Elzheimer, Poelemburg, Sottenhamer and Breughel were all Northern painters who won reputations in Rome by small and .elaborate combinations of landscape and figures, dfinihed to the last point of technical perfection, but utterly deficient in truth either of expression or Ireprsentation. The finish of tbese artists was eminently finish of 'the wrong kind, due not to their effort after truth, 'but to their desire of displaying skill and producing an astonishing smoothness of surface. " The Last -Judgment" of Rottenhamer (528), the portraits of the artist and his wife, by Poelemburg (1,041, 1,041), the nicture of "'The Queen of Bohemia 4Starting for the Chase" (543), by Breughel, are all ,goed examples of these masters of nuniature. In the four pictures (554-557) illustrating " Earth," 4 Air," " Water," and " Fire," by most elaborate -sascmblages of the beasts, birds, and fishes of the firat three, and of the uses and mischiefs of the last -element, the birds, beasts, fishes, and figures are by Breughel, the landscape by Rottenhamer. All these ;men were accustomed to work thus in combination -with eaeh other, and with other painters of archi.tecture and landscape. txunanly and mistaken as this kind of work seems -to us, Rubens, with that largeness which marked ,the man, appreciated the technical perfection which Pbelongs to it. He visited the studio of Poelemburg, both in Italy and at Utrecht, and bought his works; -sometimes worked with Breughel; gave him an asylum in his house, a tomb after his death, -and looked to the fortunes of his children. But this effeminate school, who with the painters of -effects like Gerard Honthorst, and the copyists Eike Sandrart, about the close of the 16th century finked the art of Germany and Italy so closely, are :all extinguished in the splendid light of Rubensthat colossus, who with his greatest pupils, Van-dyke and Snyders, here claims to himself a whole -compartmnent of the Galler. And yet, large as is the space here devoted to Rnbens, it is so insufflcient to display the painter that properly to appreciate his power we must caU -tn aid the chief facts of his life and labours. The vainter was the seventh son of John Rubens, chevmin -of Antwerp, which town the painter's father had -quitted in 1568, during the troubles of the war between the Low Countries and Spain, for Cologne, -where Peter Paul was born. Declaring his strong vocation for art soon after his widowed mother's return to Antwerp in 1588, young Rubens became -first the pupil of Tobias Verhaegt, a landscape. painter of the Elzheimer school; then of Adam Van -0ort, a debauched ill-conditioned facile old mancierist, who, unlike most of his contempoiaries, had never sought inspiration at Rome, and of whose mnatural powers, especially as a colourist, before -drunkenneas impaired them, Rubens had a high 'opinion; and, lastly of Otto van Veen, then Court painter to Albert and IsabeUa, Arch Duke and :Duchess governing the Netherlands, a master of the Ktalico-Flemish school, which at that time mono-polized fame and fashion, and a workman of much technical skill, especially as regards colour and -chiaroscuro, but as weak in the intelectual as he -was accomplished in the material element of his rart. Many of his pictures are to be seen at Antwerp, but England has not furnished a specimen to the Manchester Exhibition. This is, however, the less to be regretted, as in nso picture of the master need we hope to detect the pring of any of the qualities of the pupil. Rubens Is the most original of painters. He studied in all -schools, and absorbed the best qualities of all. Yet no influence of an earlier master is ever manifested by Rubens in a form which we can trace. On -the contrary, he invests with his own character even the masterpieces he attempts to copy. In his .studies of groups from the " Triumph" of Andrea Mantegna and Leonardo's " Battle of the Stan-ard " 'we see Mantegna and Da Vinci transformed into Rubens rather than Rubens reproducing Man-tegna or Da Vinci. Van Veen preaented Rubons to Albert and Isabella, and with letters of recommendation from them he viaited Italy-first Venice, where he studied -and copied whatever was best in the works of Titian, Tintoret, and Veronese; then Mantua, where he became painter in ordinary to the Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, studied in the Castle and in the Palazzo T6 the stony mythology and gigantic grotesques of -Giulio Romano, and was employed on his first diplo- -natic mission to Spain in 1605, when he painted the three pictures now in the Museum at Valladolid, at which city the Court was sojourning at the time --of his visit. After his return he visited successively Rome, Florence, Bologna, Milan, and Genoa, everywhere copying the masterpieces of each school, painting portraits or altarpieces for Pope, and Car-dinal, and Chapter, for Grand Duke, Prince, and -Magnifico, living with the noblest, working as only such colos6al men can work, leaving every town he Gojourned in glorified by records of his power-five pictures at Florence, 23 at Rome, two at Milan, two g great compositions for the Jesuits' church at Genoa, besides numerous portraits, and an architectural -work in folio, with 136 plates from his own designs, of the palaces of the superb city. Rubens had, saurely, a good right to use the motto prefixed to this collection-" Noctu incubando -diuTqu." While at Genoa, in 1608, Rubens was recalled to Antwerp by news of his mother's illness, and reached the city at the beginning of 1609 to find her dead. Before the end -of the year he was painter in ordinary to the Arch Duke and Duchess, had married Isabel Brandt, and was settled in Antwerp, where, in 1611, he built a magnificent house and gallery for his work, and his -collections and copies. From 1611 to 1620 he laboured in Antwerp, teaching a great school, producing a succession of masterly pictures, winning fame and fortune, uniting a princely lg pitality with the most rigid bousehold order, the flIend of all the most distinguished scholars, poets, and statesmen, and the patron and protector of all the painters of his time. In 1620 he had accepted the commission of Marie de Medicis to paint for the Luxembourg 21 great pictures, illustrating that subtle Italian's history, and in that year he visited the Queen-Mother in Paris on the subject of this commission. But he returned at once to Antwerp to paint 19 of this vast series, only revisiting Paris in 1622 to execute the concluding two, with four supplementary pictures, .commissioned also by the Queen-Mother. The whole of this gigantic work was completed in two years and a-half, and we may add that the payment was by no means so prompt as the painting. At -the very time he accepted the Queen's commission Rubens concluded an undertaking with the Jesuits 'ouege, in Antwerp, to execute 34 pictures for their church. He achieved these works also (most of which perished by fire in 171.8) before the death of his first wife, in 1626. To dissipate the melancholy caused by this loss Rubens visited Holland, where he was the honoured guest of the painters of Utrecht and Amsterdam, and in 1627 he was in diploniatic intercourse, touching S peace between Spain and England, writh Sir Balthazar Gerbier, onr resident at the Hague. On this errand he visited the Court of Madrid in 1628, and that of London in 1629. Matched as he was against Richelieu in these negotiations, Rubons displayed not less dexterity as a diplomatist than power as a painter. He acquired the coufidence of even the cold and suspicious Philippe IV., and the respect and regard of our own proud and reserved .Charles I. In 1630 be was knighted at Whitehall, just before his return to Spain to complete the work of the treaty he had so well begun. During this visit to England he undertook the commission for -the decoration of Vhitehall, of which the painted -ceiling alone survives. In the same year he married Helena Fourment, a beautiful blonde of 16, <the original of the sweet " Chapeau de Paie"), and from this time, with the exception of a short vi- it to the Hague in 1632, till his death in 1640, he lived, and laboured unremittingly, and with everincreasing glory, among bis sebolars in his 4stately house at Antwerp. Never was a life - fill d with such various, unceasiDg, and successful production as that of Rubens. The number of hia I' fown works exceeds 1,300. Of many of them only the design and the finishing touches are from the painter's own hand. The laying in, and much of the painting, was confided to his pupils, whom he had trained in his own methods sao well that no incongruity was observable in works thus carried out by them and their master together. No painter that ever lived can compare with Ruben, in productivene s, except Raphael, and perhapaTitian and Tintoret. Raphael died at the age at which Rubens was just reaching his climax of power. Al. lowing, therefore, for the difference of working time in the two lives, Raphael produced probably as much in proportion as Rubens, and what he did being of a nobler kind and more spiritual excellence, the Italian justly takes higher rank than the Fileming. If Titian and Tintoret can be compared with Rubens in fertility and facility, they cannot compete with himn in variety of power; for, besides being the greatest painter of church pictures and history in his tine, Rubens was also the first portrait painter, the first animal painter, and the first landscape painter. If Snyders and Seghers are still the names that first suggest themselves in connexion with hunting |pieces and dead game, piles of fruit and vegetables, huge wreaths, and sheaves of bud aud leaf, of bloom and blossom, looking like the pillage of some Brobdignagian garden, it is that Rubens left to his pupils the easier triumphs of the hunting-field, the larder, the greengrocer's shed, and the flower-stall. The painter's art seems to find its most magnificent incarnation in Rubens. Raphael may te a more lovely figure in his serene communings with the monk of Prato, in the cloisters of St. Mark, at Florence, or at the head of the loving cor,ge of painters, who followed him " like a prince" through the streets of Rome to the stame of the Vatican; but, when we consider the whole life of Rubens,-his progresses, while still a youth, from school to school and from court to court of Italy; his fruitful studies and happy labours at the outset of bis career; his intercourse, before 1608, with all that was learned, courtly, powerful, and cultivated beyond the Alps; his converse from 1610 till 3620 with all that was similarly distinguished in France, England, Spain, Holand, Brabant, and Haijiault; his successful diplomacy, his splendid collections, his magnificent house and ample fortune, his gigantic and successful labours, his glorious phalanx of pupils,-weV shall find it as difficult to paralel the felicities of his fortune as the strength and range of his powers. England contains many magnificent examples of Rubens. The best and best known were not obtainable ror Manchester, principally from the restrictions of family settlement; but, though the Exhibition cannot be said to afford even a fair sample of our English wealth in Rubens, it contains quite as many works of the master as can be fairly found room for, and most of them of a high degree of merit or interest. As a religious painter Rubeas is here exemplified by the beautiful " Holy Family with St. Joseph and St. Elizabeth" (22), from Lord Hertford's collection-one of the most admirable of his pictures in its effect of diffused golden light, and in tha't more delicate splendour of colour to which the painter but rarely subdued his brush; by "the Tribute Money" (536), from the King of Holland's collection-a spirited but coarse example; and by a "Sketch for a Descent from the Cross" (from the Riolford collection), which seems to us. to bear unmistakeable evidence of the hand of Vandyke, and not his master; and, lastly, by one of those inimitable sketches in which we seem to see the painter's impetuous hand translating his thought into what is at once the simplest and most significant language of form and colour, " David, with the Elders of Israel, presenting a thanksgiving to Jehovah on the return of the Ark of the Covenant from the House of Obed-Edom" (575), from Lord Spencer's collection. Then, for history and mythology, here is the "Tomyri," ordering the severed head of Cyrus to be plunged into a basin of blood, formerly one of the glories of the Orleans Gallery, and contributed to the Manobester Exhibition by the Earl of Darnley. This is a work of the painter's prime, and deserves to rank with the "Adoration of the Rings" at Antwerp for dash of drawing and fearlems daring of colour. There is no shrinking before the repulsiveness of the subject. The Scythian chieftains who look on at the bloody jest of their Queen are truculent savages, and their mistress is a rank virago Power is impressed upon every inch of the canvas, but there is no attempt to win our interest by idealization or to enlitt our sympathy by any contrast between the Queen's ferocity and some touch of horror or pity among the bystanders. Much the same may be said of the ghastly picture of " Juno Transferring the Eyes of Argus to the Tail of the Peacock" (553), formerly in the Durazzo Palace at Genoa, contribated by Mr. Wyatt, where the whole loathsome process of picking out the hundred eyes of the il-used cowkeeper is represented with the most sickening realism. Skill in drawing and command of colour have seldom been turned to a less agreeable use than on this large canvars,. The colouring, however, suits the subject, for, though Bkilful, it is dark and lurid, reminding one rather of the " Brazen Serpent" of the National Gallery. It is easy to imag,ine how Rubens revels in the peacocks, whose tails are being furnished by the attendant Cupids with unhappy Argaus's eyes. More pleasing in their pbwer are the "Diana departing for the Chase" (549), from Sir Simon Clerk's collection, and the six masterly sketches from the "H History of Achilles" (558-563), evidently designs for some decorative pageantrv, a portion perhaps of those executed by Rubens for the entry of the Archduke Ferdinand into Antwerp in 1635. Slight as these sketches are, they are among the most startling evidences we have of the power of Rubens. From no clas,s of his rorks can we learn so well his perfect mastery of effect, his exuberance of invention, and his facile power of hand. Invention absolutely overflows in these six scarcely covered panels. You may trace it to the terminal figures or pilastersthat bound each composition, and to the devices or emblems at the bottom of each compartment. Thus, where Achilles is being dipped in the Styx, the emblem is a Cerberis chained, indicating death disarmed by the infernal baptism; in the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon you have alion playing with a globe, an emblematic reading of the " Delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi ;" so the death of Achilles is accompanied by a fox dragging off a dead eagle, and so forth. To mythology, also, belongs,the magnificent "Prometheus" (534), with the vulture tearing his liver, one of the pictures mentioned in the painter's letter to Sir Dudley Carleton (when negotiating an exchange of certain of his works for part of Sir Dudley'a co;lection of antiques, as " original by my hand and the eagle done by Snyders,"and valued in that letter at 500 florins, or five days' labour, for Rubens estimated bis pictures at a uniform rate of 100 florins per day's work. This vulture is by many degrees the grandest work of Snyders known to us. He seems to have been inspired by jnxtaposition with his master's massive and masterly Titan. To history belongs the picture of " St. Martin dividing hsCokwt h ezr (509), ~sent his Cloak with the Beggar" (6G9), sent by EIer Majesty from WVindsor. W e trust it is not disloyal to avow our belief (with Dr. Waagen) that this is a work by Van Dyck, and not by Rubens. It is, in fact, little more than a repetition of the famous picture on the subject painted at Saventheim, and hereinafter referred to. As a portrait painter we may here estimate Rnbens by the noble heads of himself and his first wife, from the Royal collection-the one full of cavalieresqueease and manly refinement, the otherof matronly northern beauty and placid good sense-precisely the quality we should expect to see predominant in a likeness of Isabella Brandt. The painter and his first wife figure, also, as a peasant and bis good woman carrying fruit and game (548), from Lord Aylesford s collection-a study for the group in the large picture now at the Grange, called "Going to Market." Here, also, are portraits of Spinola (546), Lord Arundel (in the portrait gallery), and the Bishop of Antwerp (557), the first of interest as a workof the artist's younger days, before 1608, very simple and unforced, and the second as an almost solitary record of work done during the painter's nine months' "esidence in England. The " Children Blowing Soap Blubbles" (540) sentby LordDarnley, is a consummlately truthful study of nude infancy, much finer than the " Children Carrying Fruit;" near it (541), with which it may usefully be compared for illustration of the various modes in which Rinbens got different effects in treating similar subjects. But it is as a landscape painter above all, that we here see Rubens nobly exemplified, -first in the' magnificent "R Rainbow-Landscape" (21), ali/d twi smaller but little inferior pic,tures (23f andI 24) of the Hertford collect.ion ; then in the landscapes (559), a woody scene, with rain clearing off, and (561) a sunset over a stream, bordered by trees, with a shepherd on the bank gatherilg his flock for folding. The "Rainbow l andwape," which was long anornarnent of the Balbi Gallery at Genoa, and thence came to the Orford collection in 1823, at the price of 2,6001., is a worthy companion of the great landscape in the National Gallery. Both are examples of the broadest and most vigorous treatment by which truth of landscape can be conveyed. Indeed, there is something almost recklegs in the careless but unerring brush-work by means of which the painter has indicated the details of the ditch, with its squattering ducks and ru inating cows, the stagnant water and marsh vegetation and alder copse in the foreground, the standing corn of the middle distance, and the sun-lighted spread of field and woodland stretching away to the far horizon. This distance has doubtless lost much by the turning of its blues to greens, but, taking the picture as it stands,-foreground, middle ground, and distance-with its broken sky spanned by the mighty prismatic arch, and it remains the crowning example of broad and rapid landscape-painting, with nothing of the loving labour and patient elaboration of the later Netherlandish masters In this kind, but with not less trathtul indication by pictorial shorthand of all that is chiefly significant in the scene represented. This is, par sceUlence, masterly painting, for it is possible only for those who have by slow and patient labour achieved the secret of such indicative representation. Unless the power of broad work be one attained ina this way and at this price, it is a dangerous delusion; and what we admire in its manifestations in that case is, not the ease with which the truth is given up to a certain point, but the sureness of the painters hand and the successful impudence of his brush, without thinkiDg of truth at alL. Painters who paint writh breadth"in this sense are worthless. TBose who admire breadth in this sense are on a track in taste that can lead to no good end. Rubens, however,is an example, not of this empty aud delusive breadth, but of the breadth that springs from knowledge, and is the highest proof of power. The only modern landscape painters whom we would place by the side of Rubens in this particular quality are Turner and old David Cox-making allowance, of course, for the difference of scale and material in the works of the latter. Constable, too, had something of it, and so had Miller, though In his casea premature death cut short its manifestation. Of Rubens's pupils, besides Vandyck, we have here five large works by Snyders-two especially, a vast display of greengrocery (545), and of dead game (572)-showing singular power of forcible representation, and a vigorous boar hunt (565), in which the band of Rubens also is visible. We more readily recognize Snyders in suchworkthan in the glowing wreath of flowers (564), enclosing a bust of Ceres, which is not unworthy of Daniel Seghers, or any of the later Dutch flower painters. Here, too, is a " Retumn from Eypt' (590), by Erasmus Quellyn, the moat learned pupil of the school of Rabens; and a " Girl and Parrot" (611), by Jacob Jordenso, with an inferior repetiton of the subject which might well have been spared. Philippe de Champagne, though said to have been once a pupil of the great master of Antwer.p, followed an entirely independent direction m his work, as may be seen from his portrait of Robert de Andilly (584), and his masterpiece in this country, the " Adoration of the Shepherds" (37), from the Hertford coUection, in which that painter shows a dignified and earnest conception of his subject, with a certain coldness from which he never quite escapes. Jacob von Artois, though not a pupil of Rubens, was an imitator of his style in landscape, as is apparent on a comparison of the large composition of this fine and little known master (664) with the landscapes of Rubens near it. Frank Hals was materially influenced by Rubens,though not strictly his pupil. By him there are here two fine portraitsthe one (671) unfinished, of the Dateh Adcmiral De RAtyter-a bluff, bold seaman, represented by the piainter with a congenial bluffness and boldness ; the other, an anonymous portrait (681), particularly noticeable for the vigorous- breadth and ease of painting in tbe dress as well as the face. Hals is the Dutch Velasquez. There is a free, jovial, manly character in everything from his hand, which proclaims himL the man to paint the rough sailors and burly burghers of Haarlem, just as the courtly and pleasure-loving nature of Vandyck marked him out for the p itore cavieresco, the painter of gentlemen and ladies. Besides the collection of Vandyck's in the Natural Portrait Gallery-to which we hope to refer in our notico of tfit part of the Exhibition-the collection of Old Masters here contains not fewerthan 25 examples of this painter, the one of all Rubens's pupils who most nearly approached his master in the splendour of his social distinction and in the wide range of his power. The leading incideita of his career, to which attention is directedforthe light they throw on the style of his works, are his admission, in 1615, at the age of 16 to the school of Ruibens from that of Henri Van Baelen, the old fellow-pupil of Rubens in the studio of Adam Van Oort; his reception, three years after, as a member of the Academy of St. Luke, at Antwerp; his first visit to England in January, 1621, probably at the instigation of Sir Dudley Carletou our Resident at the seat of Government of the tnited Provinces. He stayed on this occasion only a few months, and, though a payment to him of 1001. for a special service is recorded in the order-book of the Exchequer, there is no evidence of his having painted for the King at this time. Young as Vandyck stiUl was, a letter from Antwerp to the Earl of Arundel in 1620 describes his works as even then " begnning to be scarcely less esteemed than those of his master ," yet on his return from England the painter, following, it is said, the advice of Rubens, started for Italy. It was while on his way to embark for this voyage that he is said to have seen at the village of Saventhem, near Brussels, a lovely girl, Ann Van Ophem (she had charge of the dogs of the Archduchess), and to have forgotten in his paesion for her his design of ItaliantraveL For the church of Saventhem, at her request, he painted the picture of "St. Martin dividing his cloak with the beggar," which still hangs over the high altar. The picture from Windsor in this exhibition attributed to Rubens seems to be a duplicite of the Saventhem altar-piece. Rubens is said to have found his youmg scholar in the arms of his Armida, anduto have roused him to the resumption of his interrupted journe. He proceeded first to Venice and thence to Genoa, where he painted many portraits which stil adorn the superb halls of the street of palaces. He thence proceeded to Rome, where he resided and painted two years, thence to Sicily, and thence, with the Countess of Artndel and her sons, to Turin, aud again to Genoa and Florence. In 1626 he returned to Antwerp and painted there diligently for five years. This period of close employment corresponds to that of Rubens's absence on diplomatic busines at MIadrid and London. In 1632 Vandyck visited England a second time, by order of the King, moved thereto, it is said, on the authority of an old gossip, by the sight of the portrait of his naitre de chapelle, Nicholas Laniare. Vandyck was protected by the Earl of Arundel and - by Sir Kenel-m Digby, whom he had known in Italy. Here, displacing from fashion and Court favour Cornelius, Jansen, and Daniel Mytens, his countrymen, he continued to paint the King, the Royal family, and the Court, living in a splendour rather beyond his means, large as these were, till 1640, when he visited Paris for two months, returning but to see the dispersion of the Royal family and the execution of his friend and patron, Lord Strafford, in 1641. Broken in health and spirits, Vandyck died before the close of the year, and was buried in the choir of old St. Paul's. He married a granddaughter of the Earl of Gowrie, whom he left a widow, with one daughter, and his debts and claims for their principal inheritance. Vandyck's best pictures are those painted during his Italian travels, and in the five years' residence at Antwerp after his return from Genoa. An admirable example of his dignified treatment of portrait at this period, recalling the manner of Titian, is the male portrait (numbered 9) in the Hertford collection. The admirable half-length of " Snyders and his Wife," from Castle Howard (662 and 663), and the portrait of the " Lord and "Lady of Ravels" (Hertford Gallery) (6 and 7), are consummate examples of his second and finest manner, worthy of being compared with the Gevartiusof theNationalGallery. The"Snyders"especially, for its mingled sadness and dignity, is impressive in a singular degree. It is difficult to believe that this delicate and almost emaciated hand dashed off those -bristly nionsters and howling disembowelled dogs that hang round about him. Little inferior to tbhs woikt c, ttiis period. are those of the earliest' -y, of his residence in England, such as the portraits here exhibited of the three children from Earl de Grey's collection (660), the half-length of Charles L (61), and tbe great equestrian portrait of the same King from Windsor (736), a repetition of that in the Louvre. The third and weaker manner of the painter is abundantly illustrated by the historical portraits here. The " Killigrew and Carew" (667) is perhapsthe best of the second-rate examples of this painter; or, " the Royal Children" (683), dated the former 1638, the latter 1637. The fulllength of "Rubens" (591), with the key which he carried by virtue of his appointment as Chamberlain to Philip IV. of Spain, is also an inferior though interesting example of the master. Of his sacred pictures the collection contains a striking "M Madonna and Child" (589), full of his somewhat puffy and affected beauty; a " Pieth" (596), with a most offensive display of blood and physical ghastliness of every kinda picture, indeed, as it seems to us, in the worst and coarsest taste thoroughout, though ful of power; the "Magdalen" (595), from the King of Holland's collection, more voluptuous than penitent; and the "St. Jerome," painted for the Escurial by order of Philip IV, stolen by Soult, and contributed to the Exhibition by Mr. DingwalL The portrait of the painterf' mistress, Margaret Leman (588), is hot and coppery in tone, and the same epithets must be applied to the colour of the " Cupid and Sleeping Nymph," said to be the painter's latest picture, and very beautiful in the forms and faces. In the British Portrait Gallery we shaU find throughout abundant illustration of the way in which Vandyck worked for money. dashing off in a few days works on which in his earlier years he would have bestowed weeks ,and months, and losing proportionately in force and solidity, though nothing can conceal the grace, goed breeding, and natur&lness of air and attitude with which he invested lila sitters, both gallant gentlemen and fair ladies.
THE WATrB IN SE, JAMESS PARK. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Wc are sorry to trouble you again respecting the Work now in progress for obtaining a supply of water in St. James's Park, but we do so in order to correct the false theories and reports which have been circulated in your paper, and the attempt to show that the poor re to be injured. We would mention that, as regards e source whence the water is derived, there is one fact connected with it which we think would have altered the views of several of your correspondents had they been aware of it-viz., that we are enabled to pump a great deal more water when it is high water than when it is low water in the Thames With respect to lowering the water in some of the wells in the district, we have no doubt that it wil be the case during the progress of the works, as we are obliged to pump night and day continually to keep the water from the men at work; but this will be very much lessened, and probably scarcely felt, when the works are completed, and the pumping carried on for 10 or 12 hours per day six days in the week for the supply of the lakes8 instead of, as now, con. tinuously. If, however, any of the wells should be permanently affected, the owners will only have to do what we and many of our neighbours have had to do with our land-spring weUs, and Messrs. Barclay. Perkins, and Co., Messr. Calvert and Co., and scores besides, have had to do with their (what are called) Artean weUs-viz., to sink them deeper, when they will find plenty of water. We have sunk many of what are caUed land-spring wells on this and on thenorth side of the Thames without finding the water-bearing stratum of sand and gravel in " pot holes." We found the same sort of saud and gravel beneath this glace and beneath fIungerford-market that we got in t. Jamees Par}, and the top of the London clay is nearly level at all these places. The pump at thp Broadway, Westminster, would be a convemence to the poor, if the water!were good; bat, having bad to supply the condauit in Scotland-yard, anda pump near the statue of King Charles at Charing-cross, with water from the Orange-street waterworks, in consequence of the water formerly supplying those places having been spoiled by gas and other impurities, we very much doubt if there be any water proper for drinking to be got from the gravel in that locality. No one could have been in the park on Whitsunday or Whitmonday and have seen the thousands of the working clsssea there with their children, enjoying themselves, without feeling that the poor would be more benefitted by having clean water in the lakes than by having doubtfully pure water from the pump in the Broadway, Westminster. With regard to the statement which appered in some of the public papers about a new spring being discovered in Ducisclard yielding 5,000 gallons per minute, &c., we kmow that this statement did not emanate from anyone having a knowled of what is being done in St. JameA's Park. Iu ourlast we told you the quantity of water, nearly, that we were getting; and we think Mr. Hughes wlll believe us when we tell him that we know that the engines and pumps employed are capable of raising nearly one-half of 5,000 gallons per minute, instead of not one-tenth, as stated We are, Sir, your obedient servants.

Tnm GoLD QUESTION.-Under this head the Revue Contcmporaine, in its last number, publishes an interesting paper, in which the author, M. Levasseur, proceeding from statistical dota already brought under the notice of tho public by various previous 'riters, arrives at the following preliminary result-:-I, The general rise in the price of provisions and merchandise proceeds from four causes, two of which-viz., war and bad harvests-are transitory, while the other two, the developement of manufactures and an increased supply of gold, arepermanent in their effects ; 2, The rise chiefly affects provisions and such articles as are produced in limited quantities; 3. It is much less perceptible in rmanufactured articles; 4, Itis greater in England than in France; 5, It cannot transgress a certain limit, at which it is stopped by competition, until prices descend to the same level among all civilized nations; 6, Before this limit is attained the rise is for some time artificially exaggerated by the retail dealer; 7, The rise in France and England has been favourable both to the merchant and the agriculturist; 8, Sadaris do not increase in proportion to the price of provisions, consequently the rise has been detrimental to those who live upon fixed salaries; and 9, those, therefore, who live upon fixed incomes daily becomepoorzr. As a set-off to these evils the author remarks upon the benefitsa rising from anincreased influx of gold, and shows that, althoughin theory an article of commerce might be expected to rise in price exactly in proportion to the increase of the circulating medium, such is not practically the cawe, because this proportional rise meets with its check in the stimulus given to production by the inereasing dTmand consequent upon a greater abundance of means. The diference between the influx of the precious metal and the amount of rise which it has produced, therefore, constitutes a real increase in public wealth. Thus, in England, deducting the effects of the scarcity which are transitory, the largest rise does not exceed 25 per cent.; in France, wheretheeffects of bad harvests have beenmost severely felt, andmaybestated at 76 per cent., the rise attributable to the influx of gold is also limited to 25 per cent. Now, the influx of gold has been upwards of 50 per cent.; therefore, an addition has been made to the permanent wealth of the country of at least one-half of the new amiount of gold introduced. Whether, and at what period, the civilized world will be saturated with the precious metal, M. LIvasseur does not undertake to decide, but he thinks that that period is still far distant, and that the activity of our manufactures, the immense increase of our commercial intercourse, and the civilization which, through the instrumentality of gold, has so rapidly sprung up in California and Australia will enable us, for many years to come, to absorb the produoe of the goldfields without being made sensible of any material depreciation of the currency. We will not follow M. Levasseur through the numerous statistical details into which he subsequently enters in order to explain the great phenomenon of our day,-viz., the disappearance of silver in proportion as gold flows in,-a circumstance more severely felt in France than elsewhere; but we cannot omit to state that, in his opinion, it is to the arbitrary proportion of value legally adopted in the latter country (156 of silver to 1 of gold), a proportion permanently uphetl between two metals the relative value of which is subject to constant change, that "France owes the melancholy privileke of always being a rich mine of speculation either for her gold or her silver." The author now inquires which of the two metals ought to be chosen for a standard. The French law, indeed, establishes 6 grammes of silver at 9-lOths as the unit value, but it also sanctions gold as a legal tender; and whichever of the two metals be preferred this preference is sure to give an unfair advantage to the holder either of gold or silver, as the case may be. One of the great arguments against gold is its present depreciation; but who can tell whether silver may not at no very distant period undergo a similar depreciation The production of gold appears inexhaustible at present, but, on the other hand, has not M de Humboldt predicted, from personal observation and positive scientific "a, that a day would come when the silver mines of America would be worked along a line of 12,000 kilometres. Again, the production of silver depends on that of mercury; wlsat if new mines of that metal, hitherto sunsuspected, were shortly discovered? Since the discovery of Tmines of mercury in California the plice of that substance has fallen from 7f. 44c. to 2f. 93o., equivalent to a fall of 6 per cent. in the value of silver.

FOBRIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (F1WuM OUJR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) rTo following appeaed In our seoond edition of yes. IN Ah -- ~, ...ux.,~ U2hJis us 0 1 P.Mx. The election movement still goes on-more, however, on the part of the authorities and the candidates than on that of the electors. The provincial papers bring us each day the circulars addressed by the Prefects to the Mayors; the sense of these missives is the same throughout, though the form be different. The MIayors are strongly recommended to employ the " legitimate influence" their position gives them to obtain a great number of votes. The theme is fhe same whatever the variations introduced into the piece. These variations are, perhaps, more eccentric than agreeable; and it is announced that, in consequence, a certain number of Prefects have been, or are to be, called up to Paris in order to receive oral instructions in addition to the circular of the Minister. More candidates on the '-independent interest" have started than vas expected. In the Gironde, for instance, a member of the CouncilGeneral has had the courage to start in opposition to one of the Emperor's Aides-de-Camp. In the arrondissement of Peronne the President of the Agricultural Society has taken the field against Dr. COonneau, whose principal claim, if not his only one, to the notice of the electors, is his being the Emperor's physician. In the department of the &mme a member of the Council-General is preparing to dispute the election with M. Delamarre, the editor of the Pati-ie newspaper. At Macon (Mi. de Lamartine'a county) a candidate stands gaunst the G;overnment nominee; and the dramatic poet Ponsard, the author of L kcrice and Charlotte Corday, is spoken of as about to pit himself against the ,roteg' of the Prefect inthe Drome; and another Dermocrat appea in the Ariege. An Opposition candidate, . Bosselet, in the Eure-et-Loire, has addressed the following plainspoken letter to the electors of the arrondisEementa iof Dreux, Bron, and Nogent-le-Rotron:- "Messieurs,-The present constitution was declared by tho authority that promulgatod it as susceptible of modificaSion, .and tho sovereignty of the nation forms the basis of it The vote which you are going to give will therefore be of get importance. If you return to the legislative Body aho same deputies as before you prove that you are satisfied with the present state of things. If, on the other hand, you vote for independent candidates, you delae that the snomenthas come whon, invirtue of the promiso madeto tho zation, ' Liberty is to crown the edific.' I present myself iZer your sfrages, Messiours, becauso I am among those who fhink that that hoar has struck, and that the management of publio affairs should be under the control of independent mnen. ". M BOSSEILET." DC Charles Levavasseur, who for 25 years was one of the representatives of the Seine-Inf4rieure, has announced his determination to withdrsw from public life. " Five deputies who have recently entered on their legislative career are," he alleges, "' presented in en exclusive manner for the auffrages of the electors, while I, the oldest of al1, see mnscribed against my name another name. Why? :For reasons which each will estimate according to hiis judgment; but it is clear that entire confidence Is no longer reposed in me. I therefore decline appearing on such terms." M. Levavasseur is the gentleman whom I alluded to soeme weeks since as having incurred the displeasure of the Minister of the Interior in consequence of his liberal-moderately liberal-opinions on matters connected with trade, and against whom the Prefect of the department, not acting, I presume, without instructions from head-quarters, exercised his Clegitimate influence." M. Levavasseur is a supporter of the Imperial Government, but his opinions on commerce rendered him obnoxious to the prohibitionist clique, and the influence of this clique theEmperrhimself,though inthese things well disposed, dare not set atdefiance. M. Levavasseur appealed to the Emperor against the opposition of the Government agents to his return, and he had then some reason to believe that his appeal would be heard The prohibitioijas, it appears, are too strong for both Emperor and candidate, and the latter has no alternative but to retire from the field. The opposing candidates will, no doubt, have to pledge themselves to resist the slightest approach to any reform in the present absuird commercial Bystem. The Assemnbl&e Nationu contains some infornaSion on the electoral movement, as followvs- "It is inown that, with few exceptions, the candidates supported by Government are the late deputies, We are now acquainted with certain of theso exceptions. The Duo de Confgliano, Chamberlain of the Emperor, will oppose :IL de Montalembert in the Doubs. Count Tsocher de la Tagerie, son of the Chamberlain of the Empress, and himself Chamberlain, replaoes the Duo d'Uais, who is set aside In the official list. In the Calvados M A. Benee, political director of the Coonsindioau,ef, and ' special defender of the cotton goods interest,' succeeds HL Leroy Beaulieu. Count 3igeon is replaced in the Haut-Rhin by xI. Nizole, jun., a man new to polities,' says the Prefect, ' who has offered Do Government a devoted co-operation in order to support a dynastywhich hassaved the country and coveredit with glory.' Ia spite of what has beea said to tho contrary by certain papers, the number of non-official candidates is far from numerous, and we r right in recognizing a commencement of abstaining. Before we allude to the opposition candidates put forward, it will be prudent to wait and see if they are serious in their intentions. x EL Bo2selet has addressed a circular to the electors declaring himself an independent candidate. MI. Jules Brame likewise presents himself to one of the districts of the Nord as an 'independent candidate.' The efemomi de IlUc Is quite scandalized at this term, and asks what it signifies. Why does it not rocommend the rlval of 1L Brame to adopt the same title? The journals, which, in the wvords of the Moniteur de la C8te d'Or, have the honour of being the organs of the Administration, neglect no opportunity of reoommending the candidites of the official list. In this view every opportunity is deemed good, as smay be judged by the following extract from on article in the Charente Ncapo7onicnne (Vngoul6me), anniouncing the drawing of a lottery:-'3,300 tic eta have been taken, and 220 pmnes driwn. The l ist prize, presented by the amne. ror, has been gained by the Hon, General Gellibert des butins, who represented the Charente with so much dignity, and who has ernedduring the course ofhisParlianmentary existence new titles to the votes of the eletors."' An understanding is not yet come to on the opposition candidates for Paris, and, as lanticipated yesterday, several modifications have been since demanded in the liss proposed. A few of the candidates would take the oaths, but others, whose names carry influence with them, persist in refusing to do so. The matter appeared settled yesterday, but to-day there are further demands, and additional and rival lists are brought forward. The question of the oath is, however, the great cause of misunderstanding. A part of the Champs Ely6es comprised between the Rue ColysetheheRuePonthieu, the Rend Point, and the Great Avenue narrowly escaped the most serious injury this mornung. A lire broke out about ]0 o'clock in the hayloft of M. Benedic, a dealer in horses, whose dwelling-house is in the Rue Ponthieu, with a back passage to the Avenue of the Champs Elysees. In a few moments the premises were in a blaze, and, the weind being high, the smoke was cmaied along the rear of the Rue Ponthieu to the Rond Point. The inhabitapts rushed in alarm from their houses, and, as there were several establishments for the sale of horses in the Avenue, containing a vast quantity of inflammable matter, serious fears were felt for the safety of the quarter. A rush was made by all the stablemen in the neighbourhood to M. Benedic's premises, and the horses, carriages, and furniture were brought out to the Avenue. The proprietor himself was borne out in a state of insensibility, and it was some time before he was restored. Anp- prehensions were entertained for the safety of his family, who at the first alarm could not be found, but it is understood they had left the house before the accident. In the meantime the firenmen (sapeurs pompiers), who are ever on the alert, arrived, and, regardless of the flames, mounted the burning walLs, Their first efforts were directed to cutting off the communication with the adjoining premises. Their intrepidity elicited p raise from every one. At first one watercart only could be procured, wzhich afforded but a scanty supply of water, It sufficed, however, until further aidwas obtained, fo keep dowvn the flames, but added considerabll to the smoke. The police force and troops from the adjsauet barracks soon arrived, and now ibat. no further calamity was apprehended the air a~med a rather ludicrous aspect. A rash wasmad. the idlers, loungers, and open-mouthed gazers X, she fire, who were laid hold of by the police, and compelled to form what is called the "chain "to convey water to the firemen. It isfeared thatthe premises where the fire broke out have been quite destroyed, Had the fire occurred at Jnight hardly a single house in the enclosure wrould ibave escaped.

In the ordihary correspondenee from Odessa of the 20th of May it is announced that the Governor-General of New Russia has received orders from the Minister to fix the end of the month for the last term of the residence of foreign merchants at Sebastopol.

CONSTANTINOPLE, JUNE L The only news of the day is the conference which took place on Saturday at tho Porte on the subject of the Danubian Principalities. The persons present were, the Grand Vizier, the Minister for Foreign Affairi, and the Representatives of the Powers which signed the treaty of Paris. The object of the meeting was to inquire into the complaints against the Governmenit of Eoldais, 'brought forward by some of the commissioners, especially' those of France and Sardinila, and also to solve some difficulties encountered in carrying out the provisions ^' the Imperial firman. The con.. ference lasted several hours, and broke up at aix advanced hour of the night. It appears that th points in dispute were settled to the satisfation of all parties, and more especially of the Turkish Government. The Naib of Circassia, a personage of whom a great deal has been said during the late war, arrived unexpectedly in Constantinople a few days ago. It would seem that the influence of this chief haa been on the decline for some time past, Sefer Pasha, hit rival in the leadership of thete mountain6ers, having gained a great ascendancy by attracting and grouping around himself a number of Polish officera and soldiers. The Naib arrived in Constantinople with the avowed object of making a pilgrimage to Mecca, but in reality to enlist foreigners in his service. 'The Ottoman Government has, however, detained him prisoner in the Seraskierate, to avoid any further remonstrances of the Russians; and it is said that a town in Anatolia will be aasigned to him as a residence. From some unknown source as much as 50,00Ol. sterling had been raised for sending assistance to Circassia. A very smaU part of this money was actually expended in fitting out the expedition which sailed there in the Kangaroo; but since the arrest and exile of the two Pashas accused of having promoted the expedition the balance has disappeared, and is not likely ever to be accounted for, as the persons who supplied the money are afraid to make any open inquiry about the matter. Since their arrival in Circassia the Poles have been occupied in supplying themselves from the generosity of the Circassians with the means of encamping and subsisting. They are far too small a body to attempt any offensive measures against the Russians on the Kuban,and the latter have not yet made any advance against them. The numerous aecounts of battles fought and won, which have been recently going the round of a certain portion of the Iress, are fables, without the least foundation in fact, The Sultan was meditating an excursion into the Sea of Marmora. He was oing, in the fint place, to slmid, where a line-of-battlesFbpis to bo launchod, and then round the coast as far as Gallipoli. The journey has, however, been postponed for the present, if not altogether abandoned, The ceremoiny of the circumcision of his son will shortly take place. 64,000 children, from all parts of 'the empire, have already been inscribed for undergoing the ceremony, at the Sultan's expense, at the same time as his son. The native bankers have during the past fortnight had several meetings among themselves and several interviews -with the 4Orand Vizier on the subject of a national bank. There seems some probability that they will be able to come to an understanding. The whole amount of the capital will be subscribed in the empire. The statutes of the projected institution are those of the late Wilkins bank, with several important additions and modifications. AUSTRIA. (moar oUnt OWN coRESRrONDET.) VIENNA, JuNE 7. The Wiener Zeiiung contains the text of the " Currency Treaty" (M'iinz,-y7erfrag), which on the 24th January, 1857, was coneluded between Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, Wurtemberg, and 22 of the smaller German States. In Northern Germany 30 dollars, in Austria 45 florins, and in Southern Germany 524 dollars, will be minted out of 1 lb. (of 500 French grammes) of fine silver. In order to facilitate commerce, two silver "Union coins" will be minted, which will be current in all those German States that are parties to the treaty. The one coin, the dollar, will pass for If. 30k. in Austria, and for 1f. 45k. in Southern Germany. The other-the two-dollar piecewill be equal to 3fl. in Austria, and to 3fl. 30k. in Southern Germany. The metal of which the Union coins are to be made will consist of 900,000 parts of silver and 100,000 parts of copper, so that 27 single or 13i double dollars will weigh a pound. On the one side of the coin is to be the head of the Sovereign of the country, and on the other his arms, with an inscription stating how mueh fine silver the eoin contains, and its value. By the 31st of Deeember, 1862, all the contracting States must have minted $24, and during every successive four years $16, for each 100 persons of its population. The Austrian zwanzigers and pieces of 10 kreutzers will be entirely withdrawn, and instead of them coins worth a quarter of a florin (5 grosehens or 15 kreutzers) will come into circulation. 8,750,000 " Union dollars' must be minted and put into cireulation in Austria by the 31st December, 1862. Even the Austrian coins of 6 and 3 kreutzers will have to be reminted, as they must be exactly 1-10th and 1-20th part of the new Austrian forin, and consequently 1-15th I and 1-30th part of the union dollar. For the convenience of the foreign mercantile world two Union coins of gold. will be introduced. The one, "the crown," will be the fiftieth, and the other, " the half-crown," the hundredth part of a pound (of 500 French grammes) of fine gold. The metal of which the gold Union coins are to be made will consist of 900,000 parts of fine gold and 100,Q000 parts of copper, so that 45 crowns and 90 halfcrowns will weigh a pound. On the one side of the coin will be the head of the Sovereign of tbe country, and on the other the name of the coin, in an open garland of oak-leaves (corona), and the date. The contracting States will mint no other gold coins, but Austria will be allowed to keep her ducats in circulation until the end of the year 1865.* As the gold "U Union coins" will vary in value according to the price of gold at Vienna, Trieste, Milan, Berlin, Frankfort, Augsburg, &c., they will to all intents and purposes be articles of commerce. All other German or foreign States are at liberty to become parties to the Currency Treaty, which is to be binding until the end of the year 1878. The Emperor has not yet decided whether to return to Hiungary or to go for a couple of months to Ischr. The day before yesterdav their Majesties pamsed some time in the vault in the Convent of the Capuchins where the remains of their little daughter are lying.

His Holiness will make his solemn entry into the city of Bologna on Tuesday, the 9th. As you are probably aware, a fire broke out in the Cathedral at Ancona, while the Sovereign Pontiff was taking offhis robes in the sacristy after having celebrated mass. Fortunately, the band of the firemen was posted in front of the sacred edifice, and its members soon managed to get the upper hand of the flames. The valuable pictures by Guercino, Lippi, &c., were not injured. The Archduke Ferdinand Maxibnilian,who was expected at LIeghorn on the 2d inst., must already be on his way to Spain, Portugal, and England. The following is a summary of telegraphic news relative to the prospects of the Italian silk-growers. The silkworms have suffered in the districta of Mantua, Brescia, and Cremona, but the apprehensions of the inhabitants of the country around ilana and Pavia were exaggerated. The worms are tbriving in Friuli, Venice, and the Tyrol, as also in M9dena, Parma, in the domains of the Church, and in Tuscan. In Sardinia the prospecta are but middling. Silkworms' ega, which now cost 40 lire (11, 6s. 8d.) an ounce, faled th times in some of tbh Austro-italian districta. The price of silk i enormously high. A " Bear," who has recently much astonished his colleagues by the splendour of his equipage and the r elegance of his country-house, was yeaterday arrested for forging the signature of some of the Vienna bankers.

Her Majesty weeps continually, and hardly ever quits her private apartments, except to go to the church attached to the palace. Tlhe Count of Syracuse, the brother of the Eing of :Naples, arrived at Trieste this morning, and is now onl his way te this city. ITALY. AL letter from Bologna of the 2d instant, informs us that the Cardinal Archbishop of the diocess h.a published a charge in which he congratulates hia clergy on. the favourable effect produced by the missions aud the sermons which have been preached in' that city during the last month. The Cardinal Viale Prel% is a great patron of the Jesuits. Be follows their maxims with persevefrinC tenacity. The Cardinal, moreover, is all-powerful, and the authorities conform to his injunctions and obey his instructions. The following are the last measures adopted by the Crdinal:-His Eminence has ordered that a portion of the statue Gigante di Piazza shall be covered, to avoid scaudaL This statue was the work of John of Bologna, and had remained uncovered for many years The same regulation has been enforced with respect to all the putini, Bo much admired in the churches of Bologna. The Cardinal has forbidden any more singing in the churches. By his measure, the chapel of St. Petrona, so renowned for its vocal music, will be deprived of its celebrIty. All servile work is strictly forbidden on Sundays and holydays, and should any person be found in the streets carrying the smallest parcel the police have orders to arrest him, and force himto pay a. heavy fine. These stringent regulations cause the inhabitants sincerelyto regret the loss of their previous Archbishop, C,ardinal Oppizzoni, who was a remarkably mild aud tolerant ecclesiastic. The contrast between the twro Archbishops is so great that Cardinal Viale Prelb is as unpopular at Bologna as his venerable predecessor was beloved and esteemed. A letter from Parms, of the 3d inst., announce3 that the trial of the prisoners accused of havlng been cdnected with the political disturbances of the year 1854 has taken an extraordinary tur One prisoner, who had given information against his acc0m plimes, bas refused to ager to give evidence against them in public. He declares that he had received a promise from the authorities that he should not be confronted with his confederate3. Every inducement has beei lield out to him to 'prevail on him to repeat his evidence in court, but he remains obstinate. The judges have consequently continued the trial without him, and it is believed that the other prisoners 'will be acquitted. The Pope arrived at Rimini on the 4th inst.
itREl TsEATsENT OF SAILORS 1E AmEaN SmePS.-In the latter part of April last tho packet ship Cultivator arnived at this port from Liverpool. Her crew of 24 men, lame and stiff, covered with sores and bruises, presented a frightful appearance. Immediately on arrival they made complaint against the offlcers of the ship for crel treatment on the voyage home. On this complaint the caphin and the firstand second mates of the ship were arrested, the third mate escaping over the ship's side into a boat when the United State6 A=rsual came on board to make the arreate. After a brief examination of the prisoners, which hasrecentlybeen concluded before the United States' Commissioner's Court in this city, the complaint of the seamen was dismissed on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain it. We have no disposition to carp at the decision of the Court in this pticular case. But, in view of the remarkable fact that nearly every case of a like character which has ever come under our observation has been dismissed just as this was, we cannot help asking, what is thst " sufficient evidence" which Ii necessary to establish a complaint of this kindc? This ii certainly a proper inquiry at the prent time, when the frequency of these oomplaints has become so notorious as t attract to them an unusual degree of attention on both side 4 of the Atlantic. We hear from every quarter of crueltie, practised upon seamen on board American ships. The casae on board the Guy Mannering and the James L. Bogart which were recently investigated by the Liverpool coarts and which were not dismissed, as similar cases have been dismissed here, by that subterfuge about "sufficient evL dence," but which were prosecuted to the just punishment of the offenders, are yet fesh in our memory. It is not neces Fury, however, to croas the Atlantic to fiud these instancei of arbarity. Nearly every ship from Liverpool that drops anchor in this port brings home a crew whose persons have been bruised, battered, and mauled on the high seas. These cruelties have been inflicted either by the sailors themselves upon one another, or by the officers of the ship. The men suffering them immediately on arrival in port charge them upon the officers, who being arrested, if they do not succeel in running away, are brought before the court to auswer the charge, but are, somehow or other, invariably acquitted of it on the plea that there is not "sufficient evidence." Again we as., what is " sufficient evidencee' It is true in nearly every one of the cases complained of-and in the case of the Cultivator there was ocular demonstration of the fact-that the complainants have been most inhumanly treated by somebody-a treatment which we cannot sup. pose they inflicted on themselves. They describe minmutey the vanous methods in which they were tortured; how they were bayed by bulldogs, stunned by slung-ahot, battered with belaying pins, hammered with steel knuckles, maimed by pistol balls; how their naked bodies were wcoured in salt water with coarse canvass until the skin was chafed away and the raw flesh appeared ; how their limbs were smeared with slush, their heads shaved and dressed with tar; how every man in the forecastle was kicked and cuffed, racked and starved, day after day on the voyage-by ,omebody. Theyshowtheirscareand wounds yetbleeding, and they affirm unanimously that all these barbarities were perpetrated by the officers of the ship, with whom, as the crew of the Cultivator said, "it was nothing but kanck down and knock down and maul the whole voyage." Yet, strange to say, these half-murdered men obtain no redrea at the law. Their complaint is dismissed for want of " sufficent evidence," and they are carried back to their hospital, while their brutal bullies return to their ships to enact the same tragedies upon another crew, to be arrested on other complaints, and to be again set free. For, in the judgment of our tribunals, there appears never to be any "sufficient evidence" to convict masters and ma es of our packet ships for the barbarities which thev may happen to practise upon their men I If it is for ever to he alowed that the sailor-ignorant and debased, if you will have it so-has no standing in a court of justice ; that the unskilfal testimony which he gives in regard to his cruel treatment is not to be credited, even when it is corroborated by the scars and wounds yet vwible on his person if it is to be for ever claimed by aU the 8reat respectability of the gusrerdeck that a sailor is not a man, not a moral being, but only a dog, then we may despair of everseeing any liuprovement in the character of our crews, or any elevation of the stdard of our ee hip.-Nw York Tn SEA SFRPENT AGAmw.-The PorM Blizabeth A4fercurv relates that the sea serpent has actually been captured in Algoa Bay by Mr. Capper, the proprietor of the Sunday Island Ferry, assised by Mr. Newoome.

LAW IRE.POBT. COURT OF CHANcEY, TNOLN's 1f l E PABTX DAN3IBL, IN RE THE UNIVRSALov I- LE ASSOCIATION. tIGuTs Lf JLURiJS .I1 rYTi" nf A -.. v v nals appeal was heard on the 26th of May, and wa, gaged by Mr. Cairns and Mr. Batten for the appellaut, and Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Beavan for the Official mauager., in Slipport ofthe order of the Master of the Rs11s. The short lacts were that the appellant, Dr. Daniel, was one of the directors (with a aualification of 200 sbares) and shareholder? and was also one of the promoters of t:e above-named corn. pany, which was formed in 1853, and subsequently rved abortive, and was ordered to be wound up. he directora passed a resolution to divide among the promoters 2,400 paid-np shares in consideration of the services rendered by them in the formation and management of the company. Dr. Daniel had appropriated to him 200 shares, which he took, and upon being reqaired to pay a call upon these shares he declined to do so, on the ground that the contract which was embodied in the resolution must be accepted in the whole or rejected in the whole; andif a¢cepted he was entitled to be treated as a holder of paid-up shares,-that it, as rf shares on which 5'. had been paid; or if, on the other hand, it was rejected, then he was not a shareholder at alL This was objecteI to by tbe official manager, inasmuch as Dr. Daniel accepted the sharem with all their liabilities, for had the company proved a successful scheme he would have claimed and been entitled to receive all benefits accruing in respect of these shares; and furthermore, that the words " paid up" only meant the amount paid up by other allottees-namely, 5s. per share. Their Lordshpsg reserved judgment, and for that purpose the case stood m the paper of this morning. Lord Justice Tur}Lnx said that Dr. Daniel, the appellant in this cae stood on the list of contributories of the Universal Provident Life Asurance Company as a contributory inrespect of 400 shares A call had been made by the Master, and Dr. Daniel had been charged in respect of all tho3e,shares. He appealed for a reduction in respect of 200 of these shares. The Master of the Rolls refused the application,and Dr. Daniel accordinglyappealedto this Coiit.! Thefatsofthecasewerebriefiy an follow:-The company was. formed in 1853, the caplta consisting of 50,wul., in 10,000 shares of 5l. each. Dr. Daniel wa atu orial promoter and a director of the company, and subma bed f6r200 shres, and hls liabilityasto those shares was not disputed. On the 26th of October, 1854, a resolution was paqed by the board of directors by which it wag resolved that 2,400 paid-up shares should be divided equally among the promoters. Dr. Daniel was not presnt 'at this meeting, but he was present at a sebeequent meeting of the 2d of November, 1854, when the minutes of the previous meeting were con' firmed. In pursuance of this resolution 200shares were allotted to Dr. Daniel. These shares continued in his nametill February, 1855, when they were transferredto other persons, who professed to relieve Dr. Daniel from all liability in respe6 of them. It' had, however, besn hldd thatthi tnsction w not effectual to releaseh i and the queition therefore remained whether he was orignally uiahleunder the allotment of the 200 shares. It was properly?ctneeded atthe As that the directors had no poirer to pacs the resolution, and thit the shareholders were not 6rigsall' bound by it; but it was arged the shareholders had no cMa, except on the footing of the rnolation, and that if they relied on the resolution they must treat Dr. ' Diniel 'upon the terms 'contained in it, and that, it' :was a contract which could not be eepafatge& But this argument proceeded upon the sup1?oaiton that the shareholdsrs were entitled to look to the conta4' and to the contract only. In his Lordship's opinion this view wa unsound. There was, infact, no contractvnth the shareholders; the esolution was an unauthorized at merely. The 2,400 shares were part of the assets of the company, 200 of which were appro, ted by Dr. Daniel to himself, and thus prevented from being otherwlse usedbythecompan. Could trustee do such an act as this, and then say that they had taken the asets on the terms that they should not be liable to anr loss 4rlsing therefrom? 'He thought that a Court of Equity would tie a very different view ot the matter. . He looked upon it asadguiblebreachof trust. Itwasabreachoftrusttotakle the shares as well as to appropriate them in that particular way, andthe shAreholders might take advantage of one, and repudiate the other. Muclh rehanoe was placed upon the positlnnof the company at the time of the transaction, and it was argued that e were no subsequent shar6holders, a'nd ,thit. no one was deceived by Dr.1)anlers name appearing 6s owner of the shares. His Lordship was not satisfied wit'h the evidence on this point; but, however that might be, the transaction was a fraud on the shareholders, and must be so dealt with.. Therefore the Master of tho Rols wao. in his Lordship's opinion, rlght; but as Ierd Justice lEnight Bruce had not arrived at the same conclu. slon, the appeal must 'be dismissed withou costs. The'de. cialon would, of course, be withont prejudice to 'Dc. Daniels right against his brother directors for indemnity. Lord Justice KmIGEr BR7JCE.-I aclcnowledgethatI have not been able to free my mind from doubts on this question. But the opinion of Lord Justice Turner being in accordance withat of the Master of the Rols renders the dismissal oftheappealnecessary.

BOIL;' ,C0U1RT,O HW M-xAIM, JTM 10. DOUGLAS V. AROYMIT. tDC UTU Wil ImLasr Or UIW .160OLL9.I The object of this suit, which was heardbefore his Honour on the 1st inst., and came on to-day on the minutes, was to enforce specific performanco of aJi agreement relative to certain leasehold property, known as st. Pancras Saw Mills. and for an account of oertan delngs and trausactions between the plaintiff and the defendant Srchbutt, who has since the institution of the suit become barupt. The main question raised was whether the plantiff could under the circumstances charge any auctioneers commission in respect of sales effected by him. The plaintiff is an auctioneer and estate agent in Lowudes-street, Belgrave-quare. The defendant Archbhtt before his bankruptcy carried on business as a timber-merchant at St. ?inerizs Wharf. In theyear 1854, Archbutt being then indebted to various creditors, assigned all his property to the plaintiff upon truast for sale, and the deed provided that the plintiff should apply the moneys to arise by such sale or sales " in the first place in the payment of the costs, charges, and expenses of the now stating indenture, and of preparing for, malidng, and completing such sales, including the usnal auctioneer's commission, and otherwise incidental to the aforwaid trusts ;" and then provided for the payment of the residue unon the trusth therein mentioned. The plaintiff alleged that be had sold the property and realizedthe assets, and he claimed to be entitled to deduct the uaual auctioneer's commission in respect of such sales. Dispiktee having arisen between him and Archbutt in respect of such claim, the bill was aled to enforce specific performance of an agreement for sale of part of the property, and for an account of the plaintiff's dealings, to be taken on the footing of allowing him his auctioneer's commission. A.rchbutt hnang become bankrupt, his assignees had been brought before the Court by revivor. Mr. R. Palmerand MrBristoeappearedfor the plaintif.

His Ho';ouuR, without ealling for a reply, held that the plaintiff was entitled to the account sought; and that, both on the constraction of the deed of November, 1854, and on the balance of the evidence in the cause, such account ought to include the usual auctioneer's commission on the sales effected by the plaintiff. The account to be taken in chambers, and the plaintiff to have his costs of suit UD to the hearing, except the costs of certain parts of his affidavits which set forth documents otherwise proved in the canse.
VIOE-ORANELBRS' COURTS, JuNx 1D. LNIS V. BMTCEELL. (Before F-tc-Chancdlor Sir R. T. KiNDmisLxy.) 'This case was argued on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th of May last, and fuly reported in The Times. It comes on upon a demurrer for want of equity, and as it is of a very singular character we give it fully. The bill was filed by John Innes, otherwise Hannis, and Ricbard Iunes, otherwise Annis, of Newent and Linton, I I the county of Glocester, against Alexander Mitchell, William Mitchell, calling himself William Mitchell Innes out, of the jurisdiction, John Thompson, oat of the jurisdiction, and Jane Cunningham, otherwise Scott, out of the jurisdiction. The bill tated that Jane Innes, late of Edinburgh, was at the time of her death domiciled In Scotland and seized of very large heritable estates in Scotland, and personal estate coneiderably exceeding 500,000. in the funds and other secaritnes in England; that Jane Innes made a testamentary trust disposition of her heritable and personal estate, dated the 7th of March, 1832, describing herself as only surviving child of Geore Iunes, last of Stow, cashier of the Royal Bankkof Scotland, and sometime Deputy Receiver. Generalof land rents for Scotland, and 8ister and heir apparent and execatrix of the deceased Gilbert innes, Bsq., last of Stow; that the testatrix gave all her heritable and moveable estate to Lieutenant-Colonel George Scott, John Thompson, and Hugh Watson, and their acceptors or acceptor, survivors or survivor, by technical words set out at length according to the Scotch law, as disponees, with all deeds needful by the law of any foreign country where any part of her said estate might he situated, and nominated them sole execators and universal intromitters, giving them power to nominate others to act as trnstees with them, and indemnifyiDg them against omissions. There was then a power of sale by privats bargain or public roup given to such trust disponees; way purchaser to be exonered by the discharge of her said trustees, with a power to them to set leaees, but declaring always that her diapossees should diepone. convey, &c., her e4ate, real sud personal, to such persons, and for such intents and plirPoses. as she might, by writing, appoint, even on herdettibed however informa if clea-ly indicative of intentioa, dleclaring that any settlement or latter wiiU should not he tbereby recalled except so far as it was ioconsistent with any written declarations thereafter executed by her; * u declaring that any subsequent bequest should supersede all former provisions in favouir of the same individual. Theret as then *declaration that, failing any rwriting or prior settlement, the trust disponees should hold her said whole heritable and moveable estate for behoof of, and should ascordinly dispone, assign, and make over the same to h 'r nearest heirs nd executors whomsoever, reserving her life rent d tha powrer to caacel and revolce those presents, wrhich concluded with technical words of subscription according to the Scotch form. Hugh Wat'on died int the tatrs llf,. Thaht ~hwtatzX ket a bggk sailed a "jottiDg book," conitaining notes and memoranda, of in. terest directionsto her executors and trustees, od- nint valuable information relative to her pedigree, kindred4 O arily, said that such book was kept in a drawer of a table in her drawing-room, and fonud there after her death by Johnm Th~.n,son, and that he and the defendant; William Mitchell buns,P were awvare of its existence, hature and contenta, which would have afforded greatasis ance to her ex'cutorg and trustees, and that the sa'd book ought to have been made use of and thedirecto acted upon ; that the testatrix died on the 2d of December, 1839, without having made anyother testamentarydisposition or revoked that already made, save in so far as modi6ed by the contents of sach jotting book, and the said trust disposition was duly recorded in the books of cencil and se~sson by John iiojie, and provedhby GeorReSot noh Thomson on the 20th of December in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. The personal estate of the testatrixconsistod of i50,0Ol. Three Per Cent. Consols, 150,0001. Three per Cents. R-duced, 200.0001. Throo-and-a.Half per Cents., I'3,Oi.0L. likir Annuities, 80,0001.

That the effect of the trust disposition, save as modified by the jottingook, WAS to vest the beneficial interest in the whole of her herttable and personal estate in her heir-at-law and nearest of kin at tho timre of her death, according to the law of Scotland. The bill then contained a lengthened pedigree of the title of the plaintiffs and defendants, whereby each claimed to be ne6res heir and of kin to the testatrix according to the h*w of Scotland; -that 'soon reord and proof of the wRil, upon application of Willian Mitchell Bones, the whole persona estate was paid over to hinm by the executors in December, 1839, and the defendant had ever since retained possession of the same, and William Mitchell refused to aecount. Oni the 20th of January, 1840, Alexander Mitchell, en the application of WilUiam Mitchell, his tutor in law, and socording to the lav of Scotlaud, was served nearest and lrwfal heir of line in special and general to Jane Ines, the te8tatrix, called in the record his paternal grandfather's maternal grandmother's brother's daughter, Do person appearing to dirpAte his elsit; that immedihteiv alter he wa se servedi heir tlae trustee permitted Alexander MitcheU and'Wlliam Mitchell to take possession of the heritable estate, and he *as now in possession, andtesfuedto'give up the samne. The bill then contained alegations'th'at'Alexander Mitchell had 'invested parts of the proceeds of the estate in stock i England,. as would appea if the partiulars were net fErth; that William Mitchell paid for himself and Alexander Mitchell 10,000l. to John Thomaont and 5,0001. to George Scott, and various snums amounting to 5,0001. to various members of George Scott's famidy, m- mediately after the real and'personal estate of the testatrlx' was transferred to them, and that William MitcheU and Aiexander Mstchell were pst into, posession of the real and personal estate immediately after the death of the testatrix, without regard to the notes, memoranda, &c., contained in the jotting hook; and although John Thomson and George Scott -well knew, or had good reason to believe, that Alexander Mitebell and William Mitchell were not heirs. at-lavi and next of kin. and without any notice of the death of the testatrix being given to the plantinU or persona interested in opposng the claim of the defendants, and that beforethe plaintiffs knew of the death of the tesatri or the provisions of the trust dsjieption, lexander ktitchel was served asbeir without the knowledge of the plaint and that the executors transferred the real and personat estate to them in collusion With the defendants, Alesgnder Mitchell and William Mlitchell, without any necessary measus being taken to discover who were thenext of kin, or any advertisement, or auficient notice of the death, or the proof of the will, or other precaution to secure the due exhution of the trust disposition, with evidence of the defendants' title. That the defendants pretended that the 10,00X, 5,0001., and 6,0001. were given for trouble in the execution of the trusts, where Athe plaintiffs charged the contrary, and that the same were given in pursuance of an agreement fraudblently entered into betwoen the executors and the'defendants, in consideration of th'e fransfer to them ot all the'real and personal estate. ' That George Scott died in 1846, having appointed Jine Cubning'ham executri, who proved thewillon the 7thof btarch,1848.That whenAlexander Mitchell was served heir, he and William Mitchel brought as evidence document, letters alleged to have been written and preserved by Gilbert Innes, the younger, brother of the testatrir, and relating to events alleged'to have talken place in the testatrix's family, and. inter as a letter datod the 25thl of Mafrch, 1122, as follows: "Dea Fabr I'ecl if my earnest wish coneurrin, il~ltyous hearts praser could bave pr"ea with our God, I: Coul not have neeetotell you the unsekable grief whieh now my r lisl duty oblleme to rehearse. whichnow Ido, set tremblic to bethe n- senger of such di3mal tiding.

That the defendants pretended these documents were genuine, and found after the death of the testatrix by Robvert James Gardiner or Alexander Mitchell in two houses belonging to the testatrix, whereas the plaintiff3 charge they were fraudulently obtained to establish their claim, and that the letters were written long after the alleged dates. That ALexander Mtchell got possession of the house in St. Andrew's-square in 1832, where Gilbert Innes resided, by fae kes, and got access to ahd burnt and destroyed large quantities of his papers That the registers produced were fictitious, and fraudulently procured; that the defendants burnt the jotting book of the testatrix, and the docuients were removed from Edinburgh to the chambers of Robert James Gardiner, in Somerset-house, until sent back under an order of the Court of Session in 1781, when it was discovered that large numbers had been intentionally lost by R. J. Gardiner, by the direction of the defendants, and,in pursuance of a pan, the defendants mutilated and tampered with the entries in 'the registries in Belhelvie, and m5de fictitious entries ; that in 180 the plaintiffs deposited with Sir James GibsonCraig documents, being the plaintiffs pedigree, he having wishea to see the same on pretence of judging of the validity of the claim, and refused to return them; but in 1853, in consequence of the continued importunit of the plaintifg, they were returned by Gibson Craig and Company, but a.number had been lost, and inter alia an original letter, dated in 1801, by Gilbert to Richard lanes, the father of the plaintiffs, containing material evidence, conversations, and letters between the defendants and their solicitor, by which the trath would appear. The biUl contained the above statements, and prayed administration of the personal estate, an account of the real estate, and of the rents and profits thereof received by Alexander Mitchell or anyperson for him, and of real and other property purchased with the proceeds and charged with an occupation rent; and that the defendant might be declared a trustee thereof for the plaintiffs; that the clear residue of the personal estate and the rents and profits of the real estate might be ascertained and secared for s docree and injunction - that the trstees were guilty of a breach of trust and tieir estats made responsible; and that the defendants might pay the costs. Snch was the substance of this extraordmary bill now demurred to. The Attorney-Genera, Mr. Baily, and Mr. Hobhouse appeared in support of the demurrer; Mr. Anderson and Mr. Miller in support of the bilL The VIaxCn&acnA.LoR now referred to the bill as to the above statements, and said that so far as the term " tator In law" was concerned it was insisted that he must either interpret it upon English law or consider himself ignorant of its meaning. His Honour considered himself ignorant of its meaning as to its duration, except that it probably meant some sort of guardian of the person and property of Alexander MitcbelL There was a general demurrer by Alexander Mitchell for want of equity, and at the bar ore tfnus for multifariousness. His Honourwouldfirst consider the former, and he need hardly observe that in order to sustain such a demurrer it must be shown that if the causes came to a hearing upon all the facts as mentioned in the bill the plaintiffs could have no reliefl whatever, and if by any probability any relief could be obtained, although at the hearing the bill were dismissed, the demurrer must be overruled. That proposition was not disputed here, and the defendant'sargumentwasthis:-Theball sought two objects, relief as to two matters, one in respect of real estate, the other in respectof personalty, and no relief asked beyond those matters. nL respect of the realty the plaintiff could not be entitled to any relief against Alexander Mitchell, becauEo a court of justice in this country was not conrpetent to deal with the rights of parties as to real estate in Scotland, and in respect of that connected with it,-nmely, the right to an account, inasmuch as the Court could not determine the right, until the right was estabLshed there could be no account, and therefore it was contended, so far as the real estate was concerned, there could be no relief against Alexander MitchelL I respect of the personal estate there could be no relief against him, because he had nothing to do with it,. did not claim to be next of kin, and was not alleged to, have received any part of it, and tho bill so far mu,st be dismissed sgainst him. Upon the question of jurisdiction a great deal of very learned argument had been addressed to the Court, and a great number of cases cited, but in the view which his Honour took of the case it was unnecessary to express any opinion upon that point. Assuming, pro hac viae, im .avour of the defendant, that he was right in contending that the Court would give no relief as to the realty or the rents and profits of the realty, the question was whether, if the cause came to a heari, the bill would be dismnissed against aU the defendants& "ith regard to the personalty, it was justly contended that Alexander MitcheU was not alleged to be the person to whom there was any transfer, or who received any part; and certainly that would be a ground for saying that, although there might be a case against tho other defendant, there was none against him. at the caso was this :-The grossest frAnd possible was charged as practised by both defendants in oTder t- establish their respective claims (his Honour here referred particularly to the allegations of frand in the bill) and these allegations, admitted purely for the parposes of the demurrer, amounted to this-that Alexander Mitchell and William MritcheU did, each acting ia the matter not only for himself, bat for the other and as his agent, committed all these gross acts of fraud. Now, in order to try the question whether the demurrer (as far as the bill sought relief as to the personalty) could be sus tained. Suppose the bill contained no prayer relatin to real estate but all these allegations, and prayed reliel In respect of the personalty, although Alexander Mitchell had no present interest in the personalty and did not claim as next of kin; stil, it was alleged that he assisted Wiliam Mitchell in ail these acts, and the bil prayed that the defendants (including therefore Alexander MitchellU might pay the costs. Now, if a bil were fled in Englaaa by the next of kin claiming against the executors residuary porsonalty, and if a person not alleged to be interestied was alleged to be guilty of assisting in frauds, he might b3 made a party, although no other relief wa atked *gaiost him than that he might pay the ousts, provided the bill prayed that be maight pay the costs, It appeared to him (the Vioe-Chancellor) that this ae came within' that rule, and in the present state of the record hecould not ty obtained against Alexander Mitchell although theb might he dismissed as to the r tate, that iouldtDa; " said with ftpYa, Popersonilly. be . f t of equity could not therefore be sxutstied. As to the de. murrer ore tenus, it was s,aid that the' bll improperly connected two matters, assuming,;therefore,that thereshould have been a distinct bill, and thaobae of . Dann i.'Dannu ' 2 Simt was cited; but that was Aefectly differe.n* l!s i5Om tnk, becal ue there it was an inWstacy, and therelw t DOconne'Xon as here, between the realty and personaly, the whole. heing here the subject of one trust dispouftion, which his Honour must assume, in toW ignorance of Scotch law, to be sufficient,' at all evetk to pass the Personalty If the defendants' contention. -wwe adOpted Two bill, muset be filed gai thesme t -who would justly Complain and therefore, if the trnitees corl beProperlY joi--e in one bill, thecestui QUC trusts had no right to say asbvuerth subj.inut them that this~ matter Ouh!V- have heen thesubeeof two bl. l tIthat way. as far, 55 th trusteeswere ooncme d,who were notchargedasparties 'to the fraud in 4destroying and fabricating documents, tblme was an obvious distin o b n th e d Sco Dunn,-" and t her ws noo er ce which it was_a: lrdownthathe rl with brniesplecttot muliarionesold- casehee , as the presa e nt °dem un ers m ust -. verruled.

Shortly afterwards, in purouance of the umnt, Feld surreneredi the premiseis in ques. n s ia assignmets were alo made by him to the defedn.PUrunRt to the agreement, hut no actual deedl of rease was in fact ever executed. telhe died in :ugust, 185o , and immediately afterwards the defendant commnedwa an action t latWinst the p ini to recover the sam secured by his bond. sqitb defenobe to this action had been puxt to ut eventually the plaintiff filed his bill in this court to hAve it declared that, under the circumstancs he was r teere from auo liabilit umnder the bond,andtohaveit deliveredluptobhecancehlef. !lhedefenoe to the suit W ested chiefly On certain evidence showing, or attempting to show, that when the agreement of 1845 was made the defendant had reserved his rights against the sure. ties, ada that the absence of any provisions from the agree- ment to show such intention had occurred through inadvertence. During the arguments much discussion took place as to the admissibility of this evidence, hut the result of his Honoures judgment renders it unnecessary to notice it further. The case was argued by Kr. Bol1t and. Mi. Bevir for the Plantiff, and hy Mr. Cairns and Mr. Pryor for the defendant. Mis HONOuR sad that the law was perfectly well settled that incaseswhere the creditor gave timeftohis debtor and at'the same time resrved his right against the sureties they 'were not dischared; an it was eqaally -well set'led that in cases of actual releas from tho debt no such right against the surties couldi be reserved. In the case now before the Court there was no actual discharge at law, because there was no accrd and satisfaction under sal, hut a simple agreement in writing. This agreement. however, must be conastmued asan '"Vtable discharge sufficient to entitle t'he plaintiff to the relief sought'by his hill. And as to the evidence in the case, even supposing it 'wa admnissible to explain a written agreement, the whole questionL raised by thakt evidence was one which it was not competenit to the defendant to raise, for the very terms of the agreement brought the case within the lawaplcbeta release. It constituted an actual sale to _Hewiabett ionsi'deration of tho debt itself and of his paying other credlitors 5sg, in the pound. Therefore the debt was as com. plately goen as if it had been released. The plaintiff must haVes Aecree with costs so far as the suit in equity was conlcerned. FXSBEn V. COPEET. This was a suit to set aside certain bottomrzy bonds sanda charterParty, under circumstances of which the follown is a concise statement:-The Plaintiffs are t'he ownaers of a chip called the Elizabetht, 'which sailed in 1853 from Dundee for Melbourne under the command ofoneWright, as master, the ship being consigned to Pstrick Just, who, with his partners was carrying on business at Melbourne under the style ofTJust and Co., as shipbrokers and commission agents, Shortly after her arrival at MelbourneJust and Co. received a pwerof ttoneyfro th plintffsrelating to the dischagin ofth cago ndfreghtngthe ship, and other maters hu no exendng o athoizea sae of the ship in anyway Wigh. he aser,uner hoe command the sla ha gee ot. avng eendishared,orhaving resiged Jst nd Co hd dscaredhis 'wage anl mane other dlsbursements and advances on account of the ship and in preparing the same for sea, and a balance remained due to them in respeoct of such advances of upwards of 6001. In that stte of things Just and Co. wrote to the plaintiffs recommending a sale of the ship, and stating that they had an offer of 5,0001. for her, but were standing out for 6,000W, the ground of their recommendation being that there were no funds available to pay the debts due by the ship and fit her for sea. The letter concluded by askiug for a special power of attorney to sell, in case the one then in their possession were not sufficient Subsequently to this letter Just and Co. agreed to sell the ship in question to CoffeY, Hill, and Co.. merchants at Melb ourne, for 4,9001. of wlich they apprised the plaintiffs by letter; but, finding that the power they then held was not sufficient to autborize any sale, they afterwards entered into an agreenent with Coffey, Hill, and Co., dated Noveamber 25, 1853 whereby, after reciting the agreement for sale and the doubts as to their authority to sell at all, Coffey, Hill, and Co. agreed to charter the ship and to advance the money required for clearing the ship at the port of Xelbourne on a bond of bottomry, taking the ship as she lay in Hobson's Bay, and applying all necesy fittings, &c And it was also agreed tbat, shonld the sale be confirmed by the plaintiffs, then thecharterparty was to be void, and also the botto=ry bond, in so far as the interest and chargesthereo were concerned; that the principal suam in the bottomr7 bond should be educted fromthe purchase money, and the baIlanoe paid to the plaintiffs less the exchange and commismission due to Just and Co. ; nd that in the event of the plaintiffs refosing to confirm the sale then the bottomry bond to be fulfilled in all its provisions, and the shi, deli. vered up to the owners, on payment of the bond with inte. zest and expenses, less the amount of freight stipulated for in the cbarterparty.

By an Act of Parliament (the 10th and 11th Victoria, cap. 261) tho corporation of Liverpool were empowered to supply the town with water, and in the execution of the necessary works they had power to divert certain roads and to substituto others in their place. At the last assizes held at Lancaster, an indictment was preferred against the corporation for their neglect to constrsot a certain substituted road, as required by the Act, and upon the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Crompton, the corporation were found guilty. A rule was subsequently granted by this Court, calling uon the corporation to show cause why the sum of 2,2000., the estimated expense of constructing the read, should not be imposed on the corporation as a fine, and paid over by them to the trustees appointed under the local Lighting and Paving Aot. Mfr. KiNowrs, Q.0. (with whom was Mr. Milward) now showed cause against the rule, and sungested that the rule should be enlarged till Michaelmas 1Term next, and the corration would undertake, in the meantime, to put the roaa din a proper state, as required by the Act, to the satis. faction of any gentleman whomight be appointed. Lord CAMPBELL expressed his approval of the suggestion, ad stad he would give the prosecutors the hoice of "bellis or Blackburn." Mr. OVELREND, on the part of the prosecution said, he wanted an engineer. Lord CAsn'BELL said, that as the road was to be constructed according to Act of Parliament it would he better to have a lawyer, and he could call in an engineer. Mr. OmVZREND said, ho would act on the rule of *sCnie-res pr71or-les" and have Mr. Ell.s Lord C&mPPBELL said, the work should be done forth. snth.

In this case the Court of Quarter Sessions for Staffordshire, in June, 1856, had confirmed a lunatic order, subject to the opinion of this Courtupon a case. The appellant did not apply for a, certiorari, and no oase was stated within the six months limited for so doing; and under these circoum. stances the respondents went to the sessions in January, 1857, and made an application for the costs of the appeal The sessions made an order awarding the respondents their costs, but this order was removed into this Court by ceHtiorai, with a view to its being quashed, upon the ground that the sessions were functi officio, and had nojiction to make such an order; the application and order for the costs of appealoughttohave been made when the appeal was heard ana decided, Mr. SCOTLAND now showed cause against the rule, and contended that where an order of sessions wvas made confirming an order, subject to the opinion of this Court on a caIs, there was no confirmation, unless a case was stated. It was therefore necessary to apply to the following sessions to get an absolute confirmation of the order. Mr. Euddleston, who appeared in support of the rule, was not called upon. Lord CAMPBELL said, that no doubt it was a hardship on the respondents in this case not to get their costs, but they had lost them by their own default. They ought to have applied for them at the June sessions in 1856, and under the 16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 97, sec. 115, they would have been awarded them along with the confirmation of the order, subject to the care. The respondents werenow in as good a situation as they would have been in if the order had en brought up and confirmed by this Court, for this Court could not have given costs, but could only have con'irmed the order of sessions ale quale. The costs were not lost by the appellant's asking for a case, and then abandoning it, hut by the respondents not asking for the costs. When the Court of Quarter Sensi bhad made the order subject to a case they were fuci officio; the order was absolute, and the sessions had no more to do with it. If tho case had been brought up, the order so made would have been either confirmed or quashed; but the sessions would have had no more to do with it, and could not afterwards grant costs, whether the order was confirmed or quashed in this court. It seemed to him (Lord Campbell), that, at the Epiphany sessions, when the application for costs was made,; the Court of Quarter Sessions had no jurisdiction over the application, and the order then made for costs could not be supported. Such a ractice would be most mischievous and wholy unnecessary; For the Court who heard the appeal ought to give the costs, but to go to a subsequent sessions who probably might know nothing about the matter, and ask for costs, would not only lead to expense, but to injustice. The other judges were of the same opinion, Rule absolute to quash the order. RE C0BIBS, MN AVIORNEY. In this case a rule had been granted calling upon William Corles, an attorney at Worcester, to show cause why he should not be struck off the rolls for misconduct. It appeared that the rule was granted upon affidavits which stated that Corles had acted as attorney for an insolvent named Slatter, in the Insolvent Court at Worcester, and had made an affidavit in that court in whieh he falsely swore that he had received no money from the imsolvent, when, in fact, he had received 101. Mr. PrrpsoN now showed cause against the rule, and admitted that the attorney had acted improperly in making the affidavit he had- but he contended there was no intention of fraud, and tie only meaning was that the money had not been received from the inasolvent, but only from a Mr. Griffiths, the insolvent's attorney, for whom be (Corles) was actinU as asent. The whole of the matter had already been examined into in the Insolvent Court, and by an arrange. ment entered into between the counsel on both sides it was agreed that the money should be returned and that all proceediugs should be stayed. Mr. WELSBY (with whom was Mr. Kettle), In support of the rule, said the arrangement in question had been made in violation of Slatter's instructions. An indictment had been preferred against Corles for perjury, but it had failed, because the affidavit on which the perjury was assigned had been taken off the file of the Insolvent Court by some person and could not be found. Lord CA BLL said he thought the rule ought to be discharged. Corle3 had acted in eeveral Instances in a manner that could not be ap roved, but if this had been an original application he Lord Campbell) would not have thought his conduct such as to require that he should be ,skrnctoffUthe rols a an attorney of this court There could be no doubt that he was acting as the agent of Griffiths, and that the money had been paid In respect of hiy coets, and tho 21.-nota given in respect of that.

COURT OF COIMON PLEAS, WEsTTzxINSTR., JU.NE 10. _ __ BLUMIBERBY V. VLhCENT AND ANOTHIER. oLtnugs rn i5anco.-wrLnty icrrm.) n tmis case Mr. WOOD moved for a rule under the last Patent Act (15th and 16th Victoria, cap. 83, sec. 42), calling on the defendants to furnish an account of the quautity of spirits subjected by the defendants to the operation of the patent. The plaintiff, it appeared, bad taken out a patent for an improved process of manufacturiDg spirits, and this patent had been worked by the defendants for some time under an agreement which had since terminated. The defendants had, howover, continued to use the patent, and for that infringement of the plaintiff's rights the present action was brought. This application was made for the purpose of ascertaining from the defendants what the amount of damages ought to be estimated at. The learned counsel referred to " Liddi v. Smith," 23 L. J., Q. B. Rule nisi granted. LLN`DSAY V. ROBERTSON. In this case Mr. WILDE, Q.C., and Mr. CLEAKSBY showed cause against a rule for a new trial, on the ground of surprise; and Air. Serjeant Shee and M-. Aspland appeared in support of it. It appeared that a part of the sum sought to be recovered by the plaintiff consisted of advances made on a seaman's note to his wife, as agent for this defendant, a merohant at Liverpool, with the sanction of the defendant, who proceeded with the captain of the ship to !his ship's chandlers in London, where the note was filled up in his presence. The defendant averred that this evidence took him by sur rise at the trial, and that it was a mistake on the part of the captain. The COURT were of opinion that the rule should be made absolute. The facts stated were such as were likely to influence a jury, and were alleged by the defendant not to be true. If it were said whv had he not contradicted them at the trial without taking lis ohance of a verdict the answer was becauso he was surprised. The verdict was not, therefore, satisdactory, and ought not to stand. Rule absolute. WOOD V. LEYTON. This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Willes for the price of a quantity of hops sold and delivered to the defendant. £he Jury found a special verdict that the goods were notordered,batthat there was a subsequent acceptance. As there was no evidence of an acceptance, his Lordship ordered the verdict to be entered for the defendant, gvng the plaintiff leave to move to set aside the verdict. T do efendant's wife in his absence had taken in the hopn but on the defendant's return he refused to receive them, or to have anything to do with them. Mr. Temple, Q.C., and Mr. Udall appeared to sho* cause, but were not.called u pn. Mr. Serj eant Snxx and Mr. SURPE appeared in support of t e rule, and contended that there was a&pima fAde acceptance by the wife tiUl explained, and the jury hd not believed the explanation, and that the verdict was, lin fact, for theplaintiff. The COuVT thought the rule ought to be dischar d. ,2d'he Jury had found a fact in favour of the plaintiff vr-hich as no submitted to them. It was also without evidence to sustait it, and contrary to the direction of the learned judge, and was therefore a perverse verdict if intehded for the plaintiff. Rule discharged.
COURT OF EXCH:EQUER. W DN-ESD,AY. TTMV In. REVENUE CAUSES. (SittUin tr Banco.) THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL V. PITZJON. This was a special verdiot framed on. an information for non.payment of certain succession dities claimed by the Crown under the statute l6thandl7th Victoria, cap-.51. The special verdict found that in June, 1803, one Dennis Herbert made his will devising 5,0001. to executors saln trustees on trust to pay the interest to his daughter Ann durinR her life, and on the attainment of their majority to divide the principal suam equally among her children. The testator died m November, 1803. His daughter married and died in 1854, leaving four ehildren all of age her surviving, and thereupon the defendant, as the representative of the original trustees, who had died in the meantime, sold out the principal and divided it equally among the children., refusing to pay the succession duty thereon, on the ground that the legatees, being descendants of a testator who had died before the Legacy Act (statute 45th George IIL, cap. 28) passed,. were expressly exempt from the succession duty by the 18th section of the Act imposing the same, coupled wit4 the 2d section of the same statute. The Attorney-General (with whom were the Solicitor. General, Mr. Serjeant Pigott, Mr. Beavan, and Mr. Thring) argued for the Crown; Mr. Joseph Brown appeared for the deendant. The COUnT, at the conolusion of the argument, intimated its intention to deliver judgment on a fature day. Judgment deferred. THE ATTORNEY-GENEAL V. ALLEBTT. This -was also a special verdict arising out of an information for non-payment of succession duties, the question raised being the construction to be put upon the expression " competent to dispose by will of a cntinuing interest" as used in the 21st section ofthat Aot. z TheATToRNEY-GEliERALappeared, with the samelearned counsel as in the former case, for the Crown, and contended that the expression above quoted must be taken to point to the quality of the interest in the property in question. Mr. HILL, for the defendant, argued that the term competent to dispose" meant " mental competency," as well as that construction put upon it by the Crown, and he contended that by the operation of the section the succession duty thereby created did not attach whore, as in this ase, the party was of insane mind, and therefore "not competent to dispose by willt" The COURT, however, unanimously gave judgment for the Crown. The expression was, no doubt, capable of both constructions, and the defendant contended that It must receive both, and that no duty attached under the 21st section of the statute, unless the party ware competent in mind as well as in property to dispose by will. If, however, an expression of the Legislature becapable of two constructions, the safe and proper course is to adopt that which will not lead to manifest absurdity, which would be the result of adopting the view put forward by the defendant, as it would entail the necessity of asoertaining whether a man were sane or not before determining his liabilitv to the succession duty. The expressionis to be taken altogether, nd the words "oontinuing interest" plainly show that the Legislature did not mean to refer to mental capaoity, though, at first sight, the words "-competent to dispoose by will" would Import rsuh a construction, Judgment for the Crown. EX PARTE COBBEIT. Mr. STURGEON moved for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Mr. Cobbett, on the ground that he had been improperly arrested while attending at a court of justice. It appeared that Mr. Cobbett had proceeded to Winchester for the purpose of taking out a summons for an alleged breach of a Turnpike Act, and was arrested on a writ issued out of the Queen's Bench on his arrival at the Lon- don station, as we understood. The learned counsel was' proceeding to argue on the facts disclosed in a very voluminous affidavit of Mr. Cobbett, when The COURT interposed, and referred him to the Court of Queen's Bench as the proper quarter for redress, if he should turn out to be entitled to any, which appeared to be very doubtful, as he was a mere volunteer in the matter, NEW TiITAL PAPER. ABBOTT V. FEABY. Mr. EDNwn JAREs concluded the argument in showing cause against the rule to enter a verdict, the facts of which were mentioned yesterday. Mr. Serjeant BYLES, with whom were hlr. O'Mafley and Mr rouch, havnDg argued in sanpport of the rule, The Cm3F BARONT intimated that the Court would take time to consider its judgment. SrrTiNGS AFTER TERMr The 26th of June and 7th of July have been fixed for delivering judgments alone.
ARCHES COURT. JuE 9. ;YANb AGAINST EVAINS (Before Sir J. Doisow.) ThiS was a suit for divorce by reason of adultery, brought by Mr. Omwell Lloyd Evans, of Cheltenham, against his wife. It was brought by letters of request from the Conaistoria)l Court of Glocester. The parties were married at St. George's, Hanover.squAre, on the 14th of November. 1850, and lived together in adiiers place until the month of May, 1851, when, in consequenre of disweements, they executed a deed of separation, and Mrs. Evans took up her residence chiefly with her father, at Cheltenham. She, however, occasionally visited Londpn, and in July, 1853, resided about a fortnight in lodgings at 15, Edgeware-road, and in June, 1854, took lodgings at No. 2, Bryanston-street, at both of which places she was visited by Mr. Robert A. Robinson, an intimate friend of her family. Mr. Evans charged his wife with committing adultery with Mr. Robinson, brought his action for damages against Mr. Robinson in August, 1854, when a verdict was found for the defendant, obtained a rule for a new trial, and eventually got a verdict, with 5001. damages. The case was argued for several days in this court, Dr. Jenner and Dr. Bayford appearing for the husband, the Queen's Advocate and Dr. Deane for the wife. Sir J. DODSON now delivere-d judgment. After stating the circuMstances of the cas, and beo aining with groeat iinuteness the evidence in support of the several chages ofthdultery, e ecame to the conclusion that there was no sifli-' cient evidence upon which the Court could rely to justify its pronouncing any one of the charges against Mrs. Evans proved. He said the witnesses by which It was attempted to mnaintain the bharges eiwere persons whose evidence uhe Court must necessarily receive with sunsn an we they wee as in this case, directly contradictedas to mint wnateriel circumstances by animpeachable witnees o, the Court could not possibly pronotMoe the lady guilty of adultery on their evidenhe. We must.thefore pronounce that rli. Evns had failed n E the proof of the charge, and must dismissMrs.Evans. He was aware that averdict had-been obtained &agant Mr. Robinson, but he wouldl not- let that influeace g judget. That verdict was tiot evidenice against Mrts. Evans. It was long before such verdicts could be pleaded at all in suits for divorce in th cldWa coart4~ but were subsequently received as evidence th!t there was no collusion on the part of the husbabad, and th4t he had not shiunk frmon inquiry. Notwithstanding such verdict, the Court wasbontodce thne question 'of Mrs. Evans' gufi by the evdne rdc m.i thig court,' and upon that he must pronuethgilnt establi6ls,. and ,Amnies Mrs. Efans frotisu,
COURT OF BJANKRUPTCY, Wednesday, June 10. 1(4 £alU1UUIS ROBERTS SXEBS, JAMES WALKER, AND DANIEL BAORXOTTISE EYRSR, (Before Mr. Comm GWoincr GOuTLBURN.) 1nD ankrupts wero merchants, trading in copartnership at Ball-aey, Lmbard.street, London, as Sy ers, Walker, and Co., and at Liverpool as Syers, Walker, and Byers. Their accounts, as prepared by Messrs. Hart, were now filed. They extend from January 1, 1854, to December 13. 1856, and contain the following items:-Dr.-Unsecured creditors, 165,0661.; creditors holding security, 199,0101.; profits, 67,0651. ; surplus, January 1, 1854, ,5571. Cr.- good debtors, 21,7061.; cash, 61211.; goods, 3,226h; trade expenses, 34,7441.; losses on ships, trading, and bad debts, 180,2051.; drawings by hL R. Syers, 4,228t.; by D. B. Syers, 19201.; by Walker, 2,854t.; property held by creditors, 180,2411. Upon these accounts the official assigee reports that 18,769t. will be the deficiency accruing from the security creditors accounts, which, with 68,1951. of liabilities, will make the total liabilities of the bankrupts 2.52,0321.; to meet which there are assets, 35,5061. Ofthese assets 10,500U. have been realized, and from 10,0001. to 15,0W00 more may perhaps bo realized. The bankrupts' transactions, the official assignee states, appear to have been recorded in their books, and the cashbook bas been kept vith remarkable clearness, and been balanced regularly every month. This was the examination meeting. Mr. LAwRAxIcE, for the creditors, asked for a short adjournment. The bankrupts had presented a petition for prnvate arrangement on the 29th of May, 1856, and no balance-sheet had been filed under the bankruptcy until the 29th of May, 1857. Under such circumstances it was only reasonable that the creditors should be allowed a short time to investigate the accounts. M1r. LLNKLATER, for the assignees, felt that no good could result from an adjournment; they were anxious, however, that every creditor should be satisfied. The CosISSIlON-va remarked that a long tirAe had been occupied in preparing the accounts-12 months. Mr. Lnu:LATER.-They relate to transactions to the amount of a million of money. His HOO.UR ordered an adjournment for three weeks, in the meantime the bankrupts' allowance would be continued. (Before MUr. Commi8sio2r FoNBLANQUE). IN RE GRUFITH AND GlIFFlT}. The bankrupts, father and son, -were brassfounders, of Hatton-wall aud elsewhere. Thiswas the certificate mecting. Mr. Bagley opposed; Mr. Lawrance sunported, The chief ground of opposition was that the bankrupts bad, in February, 1856, allowed Mr. John Frederick Wil. ham Fesenmcyer, solicitor, of Bedford-row, to enter up a judgment for 2001., under which property of the value of 5001. had been swept off in the folowing December. For the bankrupts it was urged that they and their creditors had alike cause to complain of the course pursued by Mr. Fesenmeyer. Mr. Fesenmeyer was the bankrupts' solicitor. The bankrupts looked upon him as their friend. When the bankrupts accepted ser. vice of a writ npon borrowing 1001. in February they thought that the writ was to be regarded in the light of a security, but were not aware that Mr. Fesenmener would be able to enter up ju3gment upon it after 12 days without giving them notice. On the bankrupts consulting Mr. Fesenmeyer professionally in November or December, Mr. Fesenmeyer became aware of the bank.' rupt position; he thereupon enforced his judgment. 'The debts of the bankrnpt3were 1,3004t; their assets bad realized 5001, and but for the execution they were nearly solvent. lis HONOuR thought the bankrupts had been particlaerly. unfortunate in their transactions with their own attorhey. The mischief of money-lending attorneys had been'frequently stated by the Court, and it was not now nece to repeat it. Certainly) if it were necessary, the prewent transaotion would bo a strong illustration. Mr. Fesenmeyer would, no doubt, say that he had no contemplation of exe-' cution, and certainly he did not at once put in exeoutcon; but when he did he made up for loet time by uncommon e promptitude. The father, it appeared, had brought in a considerable sum of money into the business, and the son had managed. it. The elder bankrupt would receive a second-class, the younger a,third-class eertificato. IX RE R. CLINCH. The bankrupt was a horse-dealer of Salisbury. Mr. CHLEY applied on his behalf for a certificate, which was granted as of the second class. IN IE :}LYx AND SICHEL. The bankrupts are described as general merchants of Newgate-street. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Bagley supported; Mr. Holroyd (of the Ohancery bar) opposed. Mr. HOLROYD asked that the certificates might be altogether refused. These general merchants had commeaced with the magnificent capital of 401. 6s. Ld., part of which was in goods. Their debts, after about two years tramding, were 3,3751.; the assets about 800L, but which would not realize more than 500. There had been accemmodation bil transactions, Messrs. My and Co., now in NeWht, being one of the houses drawn uspon. Goods had been pledged, and there were other features in the case of an unfavourable character. Mr. BAGLEY urged -the favourable features of the cae in support of an Immediate certificate. His HONOUR said it was eesential that traders should restrict the speCulations within some proportion to-their capitaL Everything should not be at the risk of their creditors. Jn one order the bankrupts got 6001. of goods from a house at Paris, This was wholly unjustifiable. The trading had been exceedingly rash, and, giving the bank.. rupts due credit for good bookkeeping, their certificates (third class) must be suspended six months. IN RE L. INSTInGL. The bankrupt is described as a merchant of Broad-strW. uIr. L&wwRAoE applied on his behalf for a certEficsts5 Mr. LIs.rETmr, for the creditors, asked for n adjournment. The bankrupt styled himself a merchant. His trading consisted of buying goods ind consigning them to Maurice and Co., of Australia. M&aurice hadfailed at the Cape, and was only a tool in the hands of the baukrupt. The house of Maurice and Co. was, in fact, the house of BergthieL The bankrupt's debts were 36,00we ., and at the last meeting 5001. only were in the hands of the official assignee, Bergthiel returned the Australian house as his debtor for 15,00., and he had been sent out at the expense of the creditors. The resultwas the opinion he nowraad,that the expenses of the Australian firm had becn very great, and that there would not probably be a shilling for the creditors. He (Mr. Linklater) had learnt this within the last few hours; also that Maurice had arrived in Manchester. The creditors would like to hear from Maurice him. self how matters stood, and he asked for an adjournment that he might be oxamined. Hlis HOuOR.-The figures are enormous. You may have an adjourment for the purpose required. Adjourned accordingy. IN RE T. HARRISON. The bankrupt was a coal and timber merchant, of Maid. stone. He fadled to surrender to pass his examination, and was proclaimed as an outlaw accordingly.
INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, June II. __ - - IN RE WILLIAM IlOBl.UT FORD. (Before tiU Cm0 CO=mnSSoNm1 j=ULveuu, au aucraoneer, app lser, and house agent, a at Walworth, was opposed by Mr. a0rae, for the executors of a lady named Fennell Mr. Reed opposed for a Mr. Davies; and another creditor, named Blatohley, appeared in person. Mr. Sargood supported. The oomplaint of the executors of Mr. Fennell was a breach of trust. The insolvent had collected rents for Mrs. Fennell, who resided in Northamptonshire, for some time. After her death the executors required a valuation of the housestoprovethewill, forwhich the insolvent charged 201., and he also received payment of the rents. The insolvent did not send the money, and they sued him. He was now in custody at their suit for 2301., but he alleged that only 1811. was actually due, and of that smm 301. was due for his own rent. After he had notice he had received a half-year's rent. Mr. Davies, who keeps a loan-office, complained that the insolvent brought him a bill for 261., and told him that Mopsey, the acceptor, was aresponsible man, an ironmonger in the Mlile-end-road. He gave him 241. 14s. for the bill, and the very next day Mopsey appeared in the Gazette as a bankrupt. Mr. Blatchley, the other opposing creditor, bad lent the insolvent one Saturday 121. to pay, as he told him, wages, and he owed him 41. for money recovered from a tenant, besides the.cos4t of proceeding i the County Court. When the insolvent pretended that he had wages to pay he only had one porter inhis employ. Alter the insolvent got the money he only saw hima once. It appeared that the insolvent had been in a bad state of health, and the only excuse offered was that his business had The CniF COIssIoNxER was of opinion that the three parties had good ground of complaint, but the case on the part of the executors was the worst feature, and a very Eerious matter considering the amount of the defaloations and the circumstance under which the insolvent had received the last half-year's rent in his account. - There was no doubt he had accounted to Mrs. Fennell for some time and that a man who mixed other persons' money with his own was likely on any sudden misfortune to become a defaulter; but this case was worse, because, after the insolvent had a notice, he received money for rent. Then the complaint of Mr. Davies was one which he should notice, as also that of Mr. Blatchley, in a judgment at the suit of the creditors generelly. The learned commissioner pronounced a judgment of six months at the suit of the creditors generaJly, and nine calendar months at the suit of the executors of Mr&Fennell, for contracting the debt with them by means of a breach of trust. The judgments re concurrent from the vesting order on the 17th of April.

POLICEI. MANSION-ouSE.-Benjamin Taylor, marine store dealer, of No. 56, o wer Whitecross-streot, was summoned by the direction: of Sir R. W. Carden before the LOIBD MAYOB for having had unlawfaully in his possession four bars of iron the property of the Postmaster-General, which were reasona ly speted of having been stolen. Sir R W. Car. den on a tormer day had examined and] discharged two female children, one of whom was stated to be 9 and the other 13 years of ale, who had been charged ,vith the robbery, and had sold the bars to the defendant. Mr. Peacockt, the solicitor [to the Post-office, attonded for the prosection. A policeman produced the four bars, and said,-I went into the defendant's house on Thursday, and asked to:look at the raUilngs he had bought of the girls, and he took theml from behind the counter, and said he had purchased them for 6d. of two girls wholived up ,the court, and whom he pointed out to me. It was proved that the bars were the property of the Qneen; theat they were a portion of stores which bad been removed from the Post-office and deposited in the yard, andthey were worth is. each to the establishment. The defendant said he considered that he had given the value of the goods for them, and that he would not have purchased them at all if hs had not known the children. The LosD MAloYor-No doubt you knew them to be constantly engaged in depredations of this kind, and yon were ready to purclu.se any articles they might bring. .I regtet that I cannot, under the p resent circumsatances, punish such a receiver of stolen goods as it is evident you are more heavily than by fining you 40s. and coats.

Mr. Anstey, a grocer, produced about 30 invoices, e c. tendingfrom June, 1854, up to the present time, for goodIs bought of the prisoner to a considerable amount, one invoice #lone being for 20 loaves of sn-r, weiging 5 cwt. Eviden a, was given in another case hich 40 loaves of an weighing Ucwt 221b., were sold bv the prisoner, to Mew ,. Durrant and Co., ofLilyot-lane, on. the 22d of May last. Mr. Humphreys *ppnoed for a remand, as he intend d to ca-ll rnore evidenx, and if it were necessary he shou d showthat not one of the-30 invoices produced by Anst y had been entered in Mlesara, Cooper's books. The prisoner was accordingly remanded. BOW-STIUTT.-ThomasBrookes,Wiianardy,W in Schofield, and Thomas liles, of -whom the firsttwo had been several times remanded, were brought up for fingi examination, charged with a series of forgeries on the LOhdon and Westminster Bank. Mr. Foy, of the firm of Fo d Cartwrg solicitor to the London and wstminster Bd, te wae the case, and took occasion to observe that the reason le had not done so before was that the managers were not aware of the case. The first information they had r- celved was from the newspaper reports, containing the remarks of hls worsahip on the circumstance that the weie urnrepresented on Thursdaylsat. They were really anxious to do all in their power to protect the interests of tlie 3fr. HN.~ -No doubt, but it seems to me that it is your owvn interest that is in question. The depositions taen at the former examinations were Inspector Mackenzie, of the E division, who had charge of the case, said he was prepared to prove several cases uttering againstSchofield wedMhfle res3pectively,andto show, that i3n each instance tXhe forged checks and notes accoiji panying thems were In the handwriting of Brookres. Th dlqe pontions wfere then. taken. in twfO cases againht- It sppeared that on the 15th of May rome person presented at TMe Times-office an order for 12 insertions of an. adve tisement purporting to be signed by Mr. Barton, adve,tising agent, 2, wellington-street, and bearing his ofie stamp. The stamp being known to the clerk, Mr. loward he entertained 'no doubt.of the genuine character'of'4e order, or of the check for-77 12s. Sd. which was tendored in payment. Accordingly, afftr deducting the price of the 12 insertons, X1, h:e paid over the change, anrounting 4. 2a.9d. The clerk aiscoveredin tho mora&in that the cheek, which purported to be igned by Messrs. Uubb atd Co., vas a forgery. He could not identify the person who presented the check The handwrting in td e check and also in the order wma recognized by Mr. Barton as that of the prisoner Brookes, who mnst have obtained the paper bearing the office'stamp while in his employ. A few days afterwards Schofield presented at the office of the Daily News an order for six insertiols of an advertisement,.purporting to come from Messrs. Watherston and Brogden, goldsmiths, Henrietta-street. He tendered in payment a obeck for 51., and the clerk, after deducting 30s., the price of the six insertions, gave him the change. In this case also both the order and the check were forgeries, andawere proved tohbe in Brooke's handwritin Schofielcl, when taken in custody by Steadman, 158 §; stated that he had presented both these checks by Brookes's instructions, that the money obtained at The Times-offie was equally divided between them, and that obtained at the Dila Nlyews between them and Hardy. Ml es wa then charged with uttering a forged cheek and order for cigars at the Cigar Divan, in the Strand. In this case the order and check purported to be signed by Mr. Barton. Mr. Reeves, of theDivan, detained the document, saying he would send the cigars and the change to Mr. Barton in the morning. The prisoner went away, and in the morning it was found that both check and order were forged, and, as in the other cases, were in the handwriting This prisoner also presented on. the 2.5th of May to Mr. Sbury, landlord of the Golden.Crown, Dean-street, Soho, a check purporting to be signed by Messrs. Chubb and Son. It was accompanied with a note, as from a neighbour of Mr. Shu,y, a Mhr. Cole, of Macclesfield-street, requesting Mr. Shury, as a favour, to give him change, as it was too late to it bemg nearly 12 o'clock at night. M1 ed the papers, and sent a messenger with Miles to mke inquiries. The messenger returned without Miles, who had run a way. rThe papers were in the handwriting of Brookes, who ishad some time before obtained Mr. Cole's signature by persuading him to subscribe to a periodical work and sign the subscription list. A11 the prisoners were fully committed. hUMA OROUGH STTEET.-Mary Salvan, an aged womani, who had evidently seen better days, was brought up fdr further examination, charged with attempting to commit suicid's. i It appeared that about a fortnight ago the defendant welt ioat tmisVs sho and asked to be served with a quan- itter almonds, which is a stron- poison. A- some suspmion was excited by her manner she was served withoil ot sweat almonds. The defendant proceeded to Hyde Park and swallowed the contents of the phial, and then, belienng that she had taken poison, she went to S . k'sChurchand requested to speak to the clergym Hler manner being very peculiar, Police-constable Lombar C 168, was sent for, and she then stated that she had take poison. On being removed to the hospitalit was soo i scertained that the stuff taken by the defendant was of l innocuous character. The defendant was sent to the MErllebone Infirmary by the magistrate, but there, having agai attempted to destroy her life by strangulation, she was so t totbe House of Detention, and brought up to this court ye4 terday. The old woman stated that it was through distress and being without money or friends, and past work, that she had resolved to put an endto her troubles, Mr. BEADON said, if she was in distress why did she not apply to the proper authorities for relief ? | The old woman said she had a decided aversion to go into the union. She was sorry for her conduct, and would try to support herselfif a little assistance were given to her. I Mr. -DBsoN having read some letters relating to the case, and being satisfied with the statement of the constable who had made inquiries on the subject, ordered the old woman some present relief from the poor-box, and prouised to do something more at a future time. Lord Ernest Bruce summoned a cabman named King fo overchargo. His Iordship stated that he took the defendant's cab from, the Opera in the Strand to the Electrio Telegraphic-offica near Wilton-plwe. He gave the defendant Is., but he de; manded Is. 6d.,,though the distanoe was under two miles He summoned the defendant because it was the practice of cabmen to overcharge persons returning from the Oper The defendant admitted that the distance was under two 'iles, but he thought, as it was very late, he was justified in asing a trifle beyond his fare. Mr. BRAnON said the defendant had made out no s cation for the overcharge, and he must therefore fLe ishn 5Z and direct the overcharge to be refunded.

WorsnnP.STMy.-John Edwards, alias Mri,awl dresed middle- agd man, and Richard Shw, dre_sd k a farrher, were charged on re-eamination on. suspici a being oonoerned in sever robberlesorL the nBaden Railway. -1 Each prisoner now declined any defence, and the r irte' hd exprsed his intention to send this Cs-Q trial, when Wr. Verrey, a builder, of Great Tow=riqt who had been robbed of a bankers ch one. n 9tier articles, exprssed his fea thate t O.4 be able to attend , as he ba i imprat ds : suentg iu the country. On hern hsEdad s4e ehould be really sorry to put the gentleman at al out of hbs way, and, as his time seemed so precious, he would consent to a summary adjudication at once, or to even a trial at the Old Bailey, which would, no doubt, suit Mr. Verrey better than having to appear inconveniently at the, Sessions. Mr. Verrey had no objection either way, but the magistrate had, and, the depositions having been taken-by hfr. Safford, the second clerk, both prisoners, to their disap. pointment, were sent to the Sessions. THAMES.-Mr. Alexander Angus Croll, engineer of the Great Central Gas Company's works on Bow-common, ap. peared before Mr. SETsFX to answer a summons taken out by MAr. Edward Fulcher, inspector of nuisances and sanitary inspector to the Poplar District Board of Works, which oparged the defendant with allowing a nuisance to exist of a threefold character and injurious to the health of the in' habitants of the locality. Tho nuisance on the prenises of the gascompanywas described as follows:-" Several open pits for the reception of refuse from gas purifiers, very offensiVe; open tar tanks, very offensive; also method of slacking glowing cosie by fool water, giving off filthy efflu. vial; th,e premises altogether a nuisance and injurious to The case was originally before Mr. Yardley on the 2Nth of April, when evidence of the nuisance was given by Dr. Ansel], medicaloffieer of the 2oplar Board of Works, Mr. Fulcher, and others, who descnbed the gasworks to be bighly offensive, constantly sending forth noxious effl-via, and poisoning-the atmosphere of the snrronnding distri t. Mr. Croll did not deny the existence of a most intolerable nuisance, and said he bad reported upon it to the directors of the company from time to time, and recommeepded a change in the mode of purifying the, gas. It was then agreed upon that the use of water contaminated with 8su phuretted hydrogen in the alacking of glowing coke, the most offensive portion of the nuisance; should be distdntinned immediately, nd the ammoniacal. liqaor ands tar tanks and " Blue Billy" pits containing refuse water abould be covered over withbi aix weeks, and, lastly, thit the s tem of purificatiosl of gas from wet lime to oxide of irone changed within seven months. The question of o6sia'wi reserved.I After a long dliscussion, M Szr,rxmade an ordese for. t^ abatement of the whole nuisance in one month, and itrsa arranged that Mr. Fulcher, the Sanitary Inspector, th see the thing done in an effectual manner, and tbat if sy_ more time was required. at the end of a month it should F* given to the gas company on its appearin that thev hCd set to work with a good will to remed7 all the evils of -vhich the inhabitints complained. Mr. Futcher applied for costs, and reminded the magjstrate that Mr. Yardley said he should aldowfull costs whbn the case terminated. Mr. Sxsiz directed that 10 guines should be paid by thie gas company to the Boardcof Works, as costs. Mr. Croll said he had no objection to the amount of coits awarded, andthe parties then retired. SourTwAIu.-Thomas Tadman, a young fellow about 20 years of age, wasbrought before Mr. SECKRX for final qx. aminaton, chzrged with being concerned with two others not in custody in steainga gold watoh from the persoh o^ Jabes Cooper on the Queen's highway. - C lIr. Sxo oonsidered there was suficient eviaence to go before ajury, and cominitted'the ptisoner for trial. John Hudd, a young min in the employ of Messs Whii and Oo.; mustard, chicory, and 'spice nerihanta, No.. 2, Duke-street, London-bridge, was finally examied ehuged with stealing a quantityof spiee,' mutstard, arrowroot, and otherpoperty,iiekongng to his masters, and WilBiamne. mont, a hawer, was charged with receiving the same, will knowing it to Ireertoleu.

The only loss experienced on board the Archer during her Line months' stay at Greytown was that of two boys, the vessel being, moreover, in an exceedingly healthy condition during the vhole time she was on the West Indi& station. She was employed for two years in the Baltic, where she was fortunate in capturing a number of prizes. Captain Heathoote, having served his fuD time afloat, now retires on half-pay to await his flag. One of the hopper barges built by Messrs. Westwood, Baillie, Campbell, and Co., for the purpose of dredging the D)anube, was yesterday tested at Woolwich, and answered satisfactorily.

THE ATLANTIC TELEGBAPH CABLE. The completion of 1,250 miles (one-haf) of the cable for the Submarine Atlantlc Telegraph by Messrs. Newall and Co. was celebrated at their works, Birkenhead, yesterday, by a dinner given to aboub 600 of their workmen, with their wives and families, Messts. Newall's oontract has been executed with great speed and punctuality. On the 19th of November lest they tendered either for half or the whole of the cable, to be finished by the 30th of June. The tender for the half was accepted in the December following, and Messrs. NewaU, who had taken one of the tarnsit sheds attached to the Birkenhead Docks, at once set to work to provide the necessary machinery, all of which had to be created for the ocoasion. The wire was supplied to Messrs. Newall by their own wire-drawers, Messrs. Richard Johnson and Co., of Manchester, who completed their task by the Ist of June. Messrs. Newall commenced spinning the cable on the 18th of February, and proceeded without interruption until Monday last, the 8th of JTune when 1,250 miles (one-half of the whole cable) were oom. pleted. Thecable consists of a strandof copper wire covered three times with gutta-percha. The gutta-percha is sewed from end to end with spun yarn, and oovered -with 18 strands of seven wires each. There are thus 25,000 miles of strand, composed of seven times that quantity of wire, being a total of 175,000 miles of wire. The process of spinning occupied 80 days, 2,500 :niles of wirebeing used per day, and 350 hands being -employed. The spun yarn was also made by Messrs. Newall -upon the same premises, 100 machines for this purpose being ranged in one of the upper floors of the works. The -cble is now lying in four huge coils (each 28 feet in diame -ter and 8 feet high), el ready for being ahipped. It will be transferred, probably to-day, into small vessels, and thence ,on board the Niagara, which is expected to arrive at the mouth of the river early next week. The weight of the -able averages one ton per mile; and it is to be laid by the process patented by Mr. Newall, and adopted in the Black 3Sea.(passing the wire through a hollow cone) which prevent, twisting. The festivities yesterday were presided over by IIr. Gordon, the manager of the works, and were witnessed by a large number of gentlemen, including Messrs. Newall :lickering, C. Liddell, Whitehouse, R. Griffith, R. S Maxwell, &c. Among the toasta were " the President and People of the United States," "the Atlantic Telegraph -Company," '" R S. Newall and Co.," " Messrs. Whitehouse) Bright, and Reid," " the Managers and Foremen," "M 3essrs. -Johnson and Co.," "the Gutta Percha Company," and "the Mayor and Corporation of Liverpool." Messrs. Z2ewaU have contracted to lay down 1,000 miles of wire 4part.of the Indian Telegraph line) between Cagliai and Malta and Corfu. The tedious process of shipping the 1,000 miles of coil 'which have been manufactured at Bast Greeawich was to have commenced yesterday; but owing to the amount of work to be done before the lofty hold of S-the Agamemnon is fitted to receive it, the shi meat Is not likely to begin before Monday next. lvery -exertion is being used to get matters in as forward a train as possible;* but, nevertheless, te day we have men4;oned will 'be the earliest OB hich the cable layers can .eommence perations.

At present she has a mild half-pay look, which even the sentry at her ganguvave caunot wholly banish. Her ports are open, but only ,for the purpose. of ventilation, as not a gun is ou board. At :aresent.she is vervy much down by the stern; but the cable Eing stowed forward will bring her on an even keeL It will make a differenco of four feet in ber present trim. A ninl engineis being fitted to wind the coil on board; -and the wbole operation of chipping will oeouW, it is calculated, at lea8tsix voeks. The fwoin-shore ends are nearly finished, and 'the centre piece of steel wire cable is preogtessiDg rapidly. Though both at-Greenwich and at Birkenhead the manufactues will contionue at one end while the other is being . shipped, it is not expectedithat more than about 2,400 miles wi$lllbe completed ai all. This wil allow between 600 and 00 mpilessfor '"slack" in.paying out.

3PORTING 1-NTBZLIGBNOE. ASCOT RACER- WEDNsDAY. The Heath presented that dreary appearance character. 1s9tc of all race-courses on a wet day. The few spectators whio lined the course opposite the Grand Stand " kicked tbbir heels about" the sodden grass with a kind of listlesS indifference to the proceedings, and expoEed themsalves to the heavy showers that fell at quick intervals with a resignation which showed that beforo setting out they had been bent upon pursuing sport under difficulties. Few carriages were to be seen, and they had no lady occupants, the gentlemen inside them huddling close together, scarcely emerging from their shelter to see the horses as thay shot past them. At times, when the rain descended more heavily than usual, the Grand Stand enclosure appeared deserted, and at other times, when only slight showers vere falling,itshoweda perfect forest of unbreilas, or, as it was re. marked, it appeared as if mushrooma of enormous size had suddenly sprung up there during the pelting rain Thunder, too, occasionally burst in loud claps or rumbled in the distance, but a bright gleam of sunshine now and then relieved the general gloom, and the dark clouds occ. saonally broke, revealing bright patches of a deep blue Eky. Just as the sport was concluded the rain ceased, and when we quitted the Heath the sun was shining brightly, lighting up gaily the surrounding landscape. The racing was most interesting, and was thoroughly en. joyed by the dreadnought turfites, who, regardless of wind and, weather, will congregate together. The Wednesday, rlthough it is popularly oonsidered an " oft' day, furnislhes certainly the " prettiest" racing of the week; the appear. once of the competitors for the Hunt Cupas they descended the hill on the New Mile being particularly striking and picturesque. The triumph of Lord Londesborough caused general gatification, and the trophy which he gained by the prowess of his fily Rosa Bonheur is worthy of his sideboard. It is a candelabrum, standing about 21 feet high, of pune and simple design, having branches for six lights, which can be moved, and the stem and upper pat used as a stand for flowers. The stem rises from a rocky base, on which are represented in high relief, on one side, two fallow deer and a recumbent doe. This cup, which is very appropriate in its details, is from the design of Mr. Thomas Brown. The admirable patience with which young Rayner rode the winner was deservedly noticed; nor must we omit to re-echo the terms of commendation which were occasioned by the excellent start effected by Mr. Edward Etibburd, who was acting for his brother, who is, unfortanately, incapacitated, by severe indisposition, from discharging his usual duties. By the way, the Vase which was won yesterday by Mr. Howard's Arsenal was manufac. tured at the establishment of Messrs. Garrard, Panton. street. Haymarket. It is designed and modelled by Mr. Cotterill, who has accomplished the task committed to his hands in a most admirable manner. The Vase, or rather " Cup," is a capacious tankard of bright silver, capable of containing upwards of a gallon. This huge flagon has a lid or cover, on which is represented with great truth and spirit the contest of a boar, brought to bay, with two ferocious dogs. The sport was decided as follows:- The CORONATION? STAKES, of 100 sOvs. each, half ft., for 3-yr-olds fillies, 8st. 71b. One mile. 14 subs. Lord Exeter's Beechnut, by Nutwith, 8st. 71b.

On crossing the road Good Friday dropped back and changes were rapidly made in the foremost rank. On reaching the distance Manganese began to give wry, and Rosa Bonheur, with Humbug, Cotswold, and the Ear'y Bird next singled themselves oat.

THB PUBLIC SCHOOL MATCHES. TO THE EDITOR OF TIIE TMS. Sir,-Will you permit me to oocupy a small space in your columns to second, from the banls of the Itchin, the observations of "An Old Etonian" as to the discontinuance of the public school matches ? The same feelings of disappointment and anno7ance are fully shared by all Wykebamists, and I do hope and trust that an expression in your journal of what I know to be the universal feeling on this subject will induce those in authority to reconsider their decision, and to permit, under any restrictions they may think proper, those happy gatherings again to take place. I do entertain the sincerest respect-for the judgment and sound discretion of our much-lofed head-master, Dr. Moberly; but I am convinced he labours under an entire misapprohension as to the supposed baneful effects of these maees. I speak from no short experience, as I had the honour of personally contending when at Winchester, and have also since been present on every occasion of these matches being played, and I do assert my honest conviction that no immoral effects ever resulted from these meetings. I should be the last to advocate their revival if I thought that such had been the case. But if this is (as I assume it to be) the only ground of objection to these matches, let an arrangement be mode whereby each boy may be received into some family during those few days in the first week in August. There is many a " Paterfamilias" who would gladly take in any of the players who did not happen to have any relations or friends to whom they might go in London; and I would say, in conclusion, let an appeal be made tothepareuts themselves, " Would they wish their sons to play at Lord's or not?" I feel confident they would almost unanimously answer in the affirmative, and that would at once relieve the masters from any responsibility in the matter. I beg to enclose my name and address, and to subscribe myself,, Your verv obeAient servt -A WYKEHAMIST.
BRuTAL MumDE.-A barbarous murdet was committed in Dundee on Saturday evening, the victim bein' an old widow woman named Margaret Burnet or Quin, aa the murderer, a weaver, named James Coyle. The circumstanoes of the case are shortly these --The old woman reaided in a one-story house in. Shepherd's-cloe, Hawkhull, along with her son-in-law, Andrew Cassidy, weaver, and her daughter, Mrs. Caesidy. About half-past 9on Saturday evening, Coyle, who was an entire stranger to them, entered the house while only Mrs. CEssidy and her mother were in, and rushed upon the daughter, assaulting her, and attenmpting to use improper liberties with her. This very naturally reused the anger of both mother and daughter; and, slthough in the struggle which ensued the mother was unable to give nny active assistance, she expressed herself very freely as to the atrocious nature of the atbsult. Mrs. Cassidy at last succeeded in forcing Coyle eou at the door, hut he, being evidently excited by drink, immediately reentered by the window. The daughter, seeing his determination to annoy them, threatened to bring thepolice, and went out to call their assistance.

UNIVERSITY IMTELLIGENCE. OXFORD, Jn 10. auingreganon was held this day at 2 o'clock for tho demi6ion and consideration of various important matWers. The series of statutes affecting professors was first brought forward. The5e were all pussed with the exception of the clause to which ob3ection was made on the promulgation by Mr. Rawlinson, of Exettr, whereby professors were allowed to hold colege pr lectorships vith their professor6hips if permitted by decree of Convocation. This clanse, which wss put to the vote sr several times in connexion with six different professorahipe, was in evory caue rejected by majoni es varyng from 3Z to 62= the larget number of supporters which it fotnd being 17. and the smallest 4. There Was a6 division on the muin clause in the statute on the Sedleian Reader, but this was carried by 57 votes to 18. On the other professorial datutes there was no division. The CravenStatute was rejected by 54 votes to 31, the main objection (as wepgathered) being to the assignment of three scholarships to hy'sical Science. The statute taking power to alter the Bampton lecture Trust was also rejected by 49 votes to 38. The form of statuto establishing an examination for the middle classes was then read and submitted to the vote. The main provisions of the statute were carried by 81 votes to 16, and the title of " Associate in Arts " by 62 votes to 38. The Provost of Orlel spoke a few words in Latin against the giving of any title to the persons examined, and the public orator (Mr. Michell) handedin a protest against pro. oeeding with the sttute, on the grounds of insafficient notice The new statutb on the public exAminations was then read and promulpted for the tbirdtimeowhen an animated dabate took place. Professor Jowett would not enter on the general gestion, though he still thought that thb first thoughts of te Council were better than its second. He rose to propose an amendment on the new point raised by the last edition of the statute-viz., the restrictions upon the examination of candidates by their coUege or private tutors. He thought the clauses introduced did not go far enough. Though he believed that substantial justice had been done under the existing system, he would piefer that no college or private tutor should either vote or takeany part Ine osm; 1i;, ...:1 tr L_ tve ,,:.~~~~~~a -n ain--rvn umen; ro this eect. 5ihe rro-ot of Oriel wished to know why tho Apostolic Epistles and ecclesiastical history had been removed from the subjects of examination. The Masters of Pembroke and Balliol baving offered some explanations on this point, the Junior Proctor rose, and said he would once mtore urge members of Congregation to reject the statute in toto. Let it be once swept away, and five men of common sense could do what required to be done in half an hour. He pointed out parts of the otatute which would, be thought, work very ilL Wr. Rawlinson, of Exeter, compained of the short notice which had been given of the statute. He regarded it as crude, and even as containmg blunders. These he proceeded to point out. He objected to the restriction forbidding private tutors to examine any candidates who had read with them within the last two years. A far shorter term would, he thought, suffioe. He recommended that the existing statute should be given up, and that the Counoil should next term bring forward a less ambitious scheme. Mr. Mfichell thought Mr. Rawlinson's objections trifling. He considered the Council had moved slowly and cautiously in the matter. They had called for evidence, debated the matter fully in a committee of most eminent names, and promulgated the statute with alterations thrice. On the subject of resrictions upon college and private tutors he would be content to leave matters as at present. Atany rate, he would not go further than the statute proPosed. Eehoped that the statute would be voted on during the current term, and the opinion of the University thus ascertained upon iv. Mr. Rogers agreed with all that had allen from Professor Jowett, and had an amendment which he would hand in, sustantially the same as his. Their exa- ainations shoulc not be suspected by those without the University. He thought, however, that it was absurd to maintain the proviso that no candidate should be examined by an examiner from hiS own house. It would besufficieutto exclude his college tutors. TheMasterofPembroke replied to the objections of Mr. Rawlinson. There had been a mistake *nadebv the prmter in the estatute. He was not disposed to place Tditionil restrictions npon examiners, believing that the existing system was satisfactory. There were great difficulties in the way of any restrictive laws, which he illustrated by anecdotes. Mr. Lake, of BaUiol, opposed the sttute, agreeing with Mr. Eawlinson andthe Junior Proctor. Mr. Maskelyne, of Wadham, moved the adjournment of the debate. The Rector of Exeter explained that a short notice had been thought enough, as the alterations made since the last promulgatiorn were so slight. Mr. Tweed, of Exeter, seconded the motion for adjournment, which was allowed by the Vice-Chancellor, who adjourned the debate tUl 2 o'lock on Thursday. An examination for a scholarship on the Pusey and Ellerton Foundation will be holden on Thursday, the 18th inst., at 9 o'clock. Candidates are requtested to call upon the Rev. Robert Gandell, Mgdalen-hall, on Wednesday, the 17th inst., between the hours of U and 2, and to bring the consent of the head or vicegerent of their colege or haLl Christ Church, June 10.

His remains were interred in the antechapel of the CoUege. The procedsion passed round the court of the College.

A special general mteeting of the proprietors of this College was held at the College yesterday for the purposo of considering what stepsl ought to be takren with reference to cecrtaun apprehended alterations in the constitutica of the University of London, intended to dispense with the necessity of candidates for degrees in arts and laws being edncated in any oollege affli.tted to the University. Among those present were-the President, Lord Brougham; the Vice-President, Earl Fortescue; the Treasurer, Mr. J. Taylor, and the following members of the council .-Messrs Groto, Huatton, Martnean, Robinson, Wood, Mackenzie, Goldsmid, Fowler, and Enfield. Lord Baou;Gzmu, on taking the chair, having exhorted the meetingto treatthesbject, which was both practical and Important, with the calmness rhich became a collegiate body, the following resolntion was first submitted:.- * Th;at t meeting, regarding with great tisfaction the Intentlon of the Government tO grant to ito Universsy of London a newchareer shleh will incoeporate the graduates, but understanding tbat the ior canniaes for degree. Inarts a5nd laws dUalre, toepre benei 5plrovaloftlleproposed-chne,asce litel4to be injurioe to the cadre of regular ar,d systo moa'i education, and as not onlyr lowerring the value, hat altrng the very meaning, od an lluglsh Univernitr In moving this resolution, Mr. MARTM-AU said that the question whether degrees for the future should. be founded on certificates granted by Iaffiliated colleges or to any one who offered himself for examination was of a very important character, and, if carried into efteot, would work a most serious organic change in an English University. After going over the history of the charter of University College, and stating that the compact between the Government and the representatives of the University would be broken if any one was entitled to come and say he would be examined, he observed that he could not understand why the change should be introduced. He could have understood it if those who had recelved degrees had been improperly qualified. In examining the degrees he found in a list of 626 B.A.'s 242 of University College, 55 of King's College, 42 of Stonyhurat, 25 of Manchester New College, 18 of the Wesleyan College, Sheffield, and 18 of New College, Iondon; so that they hadtw o-thirds of the number stricty collegiate degrees. Mr. G. JESaEa, M.A., one of the Felows, in seconding the resolution, said that a University degree implied passing through a Universiy training, and even if a person who had not received a University education possessed a greater amount of knowledge than a member of a University, he was rot entitlod to that degree. If he got the benefit of such a degree without having had the benefit of the training, he would pss in the world like spurious metal passed for sllver by having the Hall mark upon it. He thought the alteration would be injurious to the cause of regular and systematic education, and that if a large body of inferior men were admitted, the result would be that the degree would be of much less value than it was now regarded. They had the greatest possible cause to oomplain of the course pursued by the Senate. l RosR offered a few words on the subject of the resolution. He could subscribe only to that portion of the resolution which expressed great satisfaction at the intention of the Government to grant totheUniversity a new charter, which would incorDorate the undergraduates.- He rememnbered when Diainters claimed degrees from Oxford and Cambridge, Churchmen raised similar objections to those of the mover and seconder of the resolution. They said it was lowering a degree, for a University degree implied a member of the Church of England. Now, collegiate students said a degree was lowered by noncollegiate students being admitted to it, even though their admission were by an equally Eevere test. He could not shre in that feeling any rmore than when Dissenters wished to participate in the honours of Oxford and Cambride. His convictions were favourable to national education. ; hEs view, the beauties of University College were assertin a certain amount of literary and scientific knowledge, and csffusing it, regardless whether it was obtained by private teacling or at a public school or college. He agreed that one essential feature for preparation for a degree was continuous study, but did not think it requisite that those preparations should be pursued witbin the walls of a college. V the best private schools were able to impart the same amount of instruction and education as the 38 affiliated colleges, they would, by rejecting the pupils of private teachings ho upeettiogthe national character of the Colle and turning it isto a monopoly. This was not tp e time for University College to resort to the prohibitory system-the more souas the spirit of exclusion was goingpou otf fashion Th. Wrzeviwswsor took the samebview as Mfr. Grote. Ft was fallacious and dangerous to go upon the principle of the old universities; they should act upon princrples quite dif. *erent from those of Oxford and Cambridge. As the London University was nothing more than a graduating machine, it wvould not be creditable to them to refuse open competition. These views wrere strongly combated by Professor Forb3s, Mr. Goldsmid, Mr. Shaen, Mr. Robinson, Mr. James Yates, and Mr. Quain, and the resolution, after a long discusson was carried by a large majority. The two following resolutions, the first moved by Mr. J.

Jr. BENEDICOS CONCERTs. Mr. Benodict gave the firtt of a eries of three grna con. certs, "dramatic, classical, and miscelianeons," at Her MAeJsty's Theatre, yeaterday Afrnoon, with the greatest scceaa This new experiment of dividing his materiali into three, instead of, as hitherto, bringing them all inta account at one not unfitly denominated " monster" entertainment, is judiclous, and promies to be adv-ataeous. The concerts which Mx. Beneiict hd ben accustomed to offer his numerous and fashionable patrons were, in spite of the Tariety of their attraction, always too long-so much so, indeed, that it was no eay tak to hear them out to the end.. Yesterday the programme contdned nore than enough for any reasonable amateur. The only fault of the selection was the rare occurrenca of 3ir. BenedictVs own name, as compoeer and performer. Two of his compositiong, and no more, 'were introducedtho overture to his opera of The Crusderr, upon the merits of 'which we havo more than once commented, and a gracfulbalad from an earlier dramatlc work (Thc Brdes of Renicc)--"At Morn upon the BeWh"-extremely well sung by Herr Xeichardt. This was to beregretted, since the admirers of Mr. Benedict as a composer-and they are by no means in a minority-naturally expect something new from his pen on such annual occasions as the present. As a performer Mr. Benedict appeared onoe-in a duet (of no great pretensions) for two planofortes by the late Kalkbrenn=r, in which the oncert giver wa assistead by Signor AndreoLU, an Italian pianist of distinction. The playing in this in. stance was 'worthy of better music. In other respects the programme 'was highly interesting. We may pas over the pieces from operas of Donizetti and Verdi, now eonstntly before the public, in which Made. moiselles Piccolomini and Ortolani, Signors Giuglini, Bel. letti, Beneventano, Vialett, &c., took part, with the statement that they afforded the greatest pleasure, and that the quintet from the uanalc to Lucia -into vhich Mademoiselle Piccolomini threw her 'whole soul, and raised the audience to enthus loudly encored. Signor Giuglini (accompanied by Yr. Benedict on the pianoforte), sang Beethoven's " Adelaida, transposing it a note higher to accommodat, his *oioe, a liberty for which, however, he cannot fairly be rated, since it had already been sanctioned in the case of his predecessor, Rubini, and his contamporary, Mario. Mr. Chades Braham gSve his favourite air from the Lombardi (" La mi& letizia") in an expressive and unaffected mnnner; and Alboni's unrivalled voice and method were displayed 'with mrvellous effect in the air (with chorus) from RItcliana in Algcri ("Pensa alIa Patria"), the immorl drinking-song from Lucrezia, and the duet " Si la suanchezza," with Signor Giuglini. All of these 'were redemanded-but Albon?s good sense remained stedfast, and prompted her on each occadon resolutely, though courteously, to decline the proffered honour. There were two important instramental solos. The firstMendelssohn's violin concerto, performed by Herr Ernst wAs a musical treat of the most genuine description. Not only 'as the execution by the giftea German violinist brilliant, energetic, and aocurat from first to last, but his conception of the work breathedthe very spirit of Mendelssohn. nI 'was in every respect a genial and noble performance, The other solo was Weber's Concer-StMick (probsely so called because it is not written upon the plan of a regular conorto), the pianoforte part in which was played by Madame Clara Schumann, with a reading very different from that adopted by Madame Pleyel, who may be said to have identified herself with this famous piece, and prodigious mechanical facility enabled her to give the last movement with all the fire and impetuosity it demands, the rapid pace at which she took it never interfering with the neatness and precision of her execution. Madame Schumann's qualies are rather pobtical than mechanical, and she is to epreferred in mnsio which exacts more from the mind than the fingers. The audience received her with the utmost favour, and she was immensely applauded at the conclusion of her performance, The finale from Mendeliorhn's unfinished opera of Lorcly -for scprano principal, orchestra and chorus-presented for the fint time in this country upon the stage, with appropriate scenery aud costumes, 'ras a novelty; and the pasionate style in which Mademoiselle Spazta gave the solos of the abandoned Ieonora obtained general sympathy. This experiment 'waa completely successful. In ali the important pioees the band was directed by Mr. Benedict, who was assisted by Signor Bonetti, the regular conductor at Her Mijesty's Theatre. Besides the one 'We havo named, the overtures to Di, Zaub-Jlc and DOer Frcuchiiz were performed. The entertainment, as may be gathered from our remarks, was literally a " grand" concert (which can be said of very few that are advertised with the same epithet), and afforded the utmost gratification to the audience. At the next a selection from Gluck's Orfeo is pronised, with Alboni as the hero ; an announcement that can hardly fail to excite the attention of oonnoisseurs,
ST. MARTIrS HALL. An excellent concert of sacred music was given last night by Mr. Hllah and his First Upper Singing SchooL The programme included Mendelssohn's Lauda Sion (the English version), and Rossini's St4t Mfater. A very crowded audi. eunc was attracted, and rarely has a musical performance been listened to with greater satisfaction. Mendelssohn's fMe piece-composed for a festival at Liege and first performed at the church of St. Jacques in 1846, the same year rendered memorable by the production of the cantta, " Au die Kunstler" at Cologne, and the oratorio of Zlijah at Birmingham-has been more thea once described at length; nor is there anything new to be advanced about the StaWat of Rossini t is enough, therefore, to congratulhte Mr. Hullah on the general merits of the performance last night, both oompositions, that of Mendelssohn especially, going remarkybly welL The melodious and beautifully hamonized quartet with chorus, at the end of the Lauds Sion, in which the principal vocal parts were admirably ong by Misses Banks and Palmer (soprano and contralto), Messrs. Sims Reeves and Thomas (tenor and basso), was encored unanimonsly-so unanimously tbat Ir. Hullab, who had succssfully resisted one such imposition (in favour of the soprano solo of Miss Banks), was compelled to yield to the demand. The choruses were all very carefully given, though at times, and especially in the most elaborate of them all, "They that through much tribulation,' the intonation of the men's voices was anything but stead - In the Stbz Mater a new singer, I,&de_ moiselle de Vilar, took the place of Miss Banks as soprano, and produced a very favourable impression in the duet, "Quis est homo" (with Miss Palmer). The otiher "princdpIse were the same as in the Lauda Sion. This was the eighth and last of a series of subscription concerts which have proved more than unusually remunerative, and have been managed throughout with equal discrmination ndspirit. Mr. Hullaideservessuccess,and we are glad to undetand that he has obtained it.

Shortly after the outbreak of the fire Captain Harris, the-. newly appointed assistant police commiioner, with Su intenmlents Loxton and Martin, Iusuectors bil'Donald, Fidge Cheoldey, and strong bodies of theS, B, and D divisions of Poihes arrived and kept back theippulace, which choked uP every Avenue leading to the rilway andl scene of flre ; wiUe within the gates of the Camden Staction, Mr. Start, the Sretay of the London and NTorth-Wester Company, Mr. avi Stpheson sueritenentof the goods depart- inen, aded y M. SperitenentBedford, and a. The scene Of deVAStatiOn presentedyesterdayvwas truliappallimg. Heavy iron columns, exceedin in some instances 18 inches in diameter, were seen bere and therstanding amid the fa]len d&ris, twisted and bent by the action of the fire, the slighter pieces of iron in the building converted into al sorts of fantaetic shapes. In the north-western corner were the clerks'-offioe an& counting-houee, and in the corner of an upper stoJry w- the safe, said to have contained many valuable books an&' papers and several hundred pounds in money. While the. for sides of this safe stand entire, resting upon some projecting brickwork on two sides of the angle of the wall, the bottom of the safe is oompletely burnt out, and therefore if there was any hard cash within it WiP' be found in a fused state at the bottom ef the building. When the horses wereturned out they were driven mostlr along the Hampstead and Kentish-town roads in the direc-- tion of High3ate and Hampstead-heatli, and this was nearly fataltor. luspectorFidge, of theSdivision. He hhads the fire and was riding rapidly down. HighRate-hill, w he was suddenly met by a drove of the affrighted horse. which were galloping up the hill at the top of theirspeed. In an mstant he was in the midst of'ri4 , horse and rider being nearly overthrown. jond being terribly shaken however, and oovered from head to foot ithl mud, he sustained uo iWnury. Thowhole of the horses were happily saved, vith one exception, and that was a remarkably fine, though. savage brute, knowrn as " the Ianhater," and which could only he managed by themawho drove him but-who wannot present. The poor brute was therefore i to perih, and yesterday ater the fire was subdued his remains were.- found burnt to a cinder. There are various rumours as to the origin of the fire, lut. noneofspositivecharacter. Bysomeitisalleged thathe. fire was caused by the spars of the chimney of one of the. barges igniting some hay or straw in the gallery; by othermthat it was from one of the men's pipes, or a lucifer match. Certain, however, it is that the premies, vwith all thev c tained, are destroyed, and the eatimated Ie6s altogether ma little short of 250,000?. It is stated that at le 40,000' quarters of corn were in the building, the whole of which has been burnt. Yesterdaymorning the rsilwayauthoritles, with ap?omp t_ ness which reflects credit uLpon them, placed at the disposla of Messrs. Baxendale and Co. a large spaLce on the opposite side of the canal and between the canal anld Chapi=n & Horne's warehouses. Workmen were inimedixsey employed in erecting temporary premises, and in the course of the day the following placard was postd on the. walls of the destroyed building and on the gates of the. railway :- " Pickford and Co., as agents to the London and, North.Western Pailway Company, have arranged for conducting their business as usual since the lamentable fire ait Camden-town last night.-Gresham-street, June 10, 185M7 Thousands of people visited the spot during the day. It is stated that neither the premises nor gooas were - sured, it being unusual for inuoe-offlices to isue, goods in trnit.
