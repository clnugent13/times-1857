AHERICA. [A. summary of the following, received by eleotric tele. Aroph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-] SOUTHAMPTON, THURSDAY, JU7E 11. The United States mail steamship Axrago, Captain Lines, with the mails of the 30th ult, from AN ew York, arrived off Cowes thismorning about 3 o'clock, after a passage of 11 dayssix hours, and, having landed pasisngers, mails, and specie for Southampton, proceeded on to Havre. This steamer brings in all 300 passengers, $1,038,000 in pecie, and 6,()00 bushels of wheat. She has experienced ordinary weather for the season, came south of the Banks, and saw no ice. Among the pasSengers are Colonel Scott, of the United States army, and family; Lieutenant. Governor Raymond and family, of New York; Madame do Wilhorst, prima donna from the Italian Opera, New York, who intends to pass some years in France and Italy to complete her musical education; Baron Gerolt, Ambassador from the Court of Prussia to the United States, Count de Verieux, &c. Mr. De Voe (Deputy United States Marshal and Sergeant from the office of the Chief of Police at New York) ic also on board the Arago, having in his charge Louis Greletr one of the persons implicated in the frauds on the Great Northern Railway Company of France. A letter from a passenger by the Arago says:- " Grelet came; on board wiith the officer in the Bay oE Nevr York, the order, under the extradition treaty between irance and the United States, having arrived from Wash. 'ngton only twro hours before the steamer sailed. The brother of Grelet died in confinement at New York. There remain only two more-Parrot and David, who may probably escape, tho evidence not being strong against them. Grelot speaks in the highest terms of his treat. mnert byhis superioms, and has had the fullest liberty on board and conducted himself in every way with propriety Both had first-class berths. After Mr. De Voe shal have delivered his charge to the French authorities he wil pro. bably visit London on his return, to inspect the police system, and place hirmself more intimately in correspondence with the detectives of London." The Arago reports having exchanged signals with the foilowing ships during the voyage :-,June 4th, at 2 p.m., in lat. 44, long. 45.30, the English bark Stirling8hire, bound west; 5th, at 10 a.m., in lat. 45.45, long. 41.30, a bark, bound west, showing in a white signal No. 393; 6th, at 2 p.m., in lat. 47.45 long. 33.30, the English bark Elizabeth, boind west; 10th, at 1 p.m., off the Lizard, one of the Cunard propellers, from Havre for Liverpool. Tho mail steamer Africa, from Liverpool May 16, arrived at New York on the afternoon of the 28th; and the Ariel steamer, from Southampton on the same day, arrived on the afternoon of the 29th. The advices brought by the Arago are three days later than those previously received by the Asia, and contain several items of interest. The Kansas Aid Resolutions of the Massachusetts Legislature were vetoed by Governor Gardner on the 29th ult. The House attempted to pass the resolutions over the veto, but failed for want of a two-thirds vote. A collision had occurred between the State and the United States authorities in Ohio, which created great excitement. A despatch from Cincinnati, of the 29th of May, says:- " Deputy United States' Manrshal Churchill and 11 assistants left this city last Tuesday to arrest four persons in Mechanicsburg, Champagne County, Ohio, charged with harbouring fugitive slaves nine months ago. The arrests were made on Wednesday, when a writ of Habeas corpus was taken out; but before it could be served the United States' officers, with their prisoners, were beyond the bounds of the county. Another writ was taken out in Greene County and served by the Sheriff, assisted by a large crowd of citizens. The United States' officers resisted, and several shots were exchanged; but finally the United States' offieers were overpowered, taken prisoners, and brought to Springfield for trial for resisting the Sheriff ia the discharge Xf his duty. The greatest excitement prevailed. The United States' Marshal telegraphed the Secretary of the Interior to-day for instructions regarding the arrest and imprisonment of the United States' officers, but the nature of tho instructions received ia reply has not yet transpired. Judge Lsavitt, United States' District Judge, issued a writ of Eabevs Corpus to-day, and the Marshal has gone to Springfield to serve it. In case resistance is offered, it is reported that the United States' troops will be called out." Tho steamer Illinois arrived at New York on the 28th, bringing important news from Nicaragua. General Walker had capitilated, and ]tivas was in the hands of the allies. Despairing of success, Walker surrendered on the 1st of May to Captain Davis, of the sloop of war St. Mary's, having then less than 300 men and but two days' provisions. A salute of 100 guns announced to the people of San Jose, at 1 o'clock on the 7th of May, the surrender of the Filibusters. The ringing of the bells, music, and cries of rejoicing manifested the enthusiasm of the people for the victors, and for the re-establishmcnt of peace. The t'wns and villages were illiminated during the night; everywhere there were music, fireworks, promenades, balls, and merry re'LfWflS, the national flag waving over all the houses. General Mora, with his division of the army, was expected at San Jose on the 13th of May. Great preparations were being made to give him an enthusiastic reception. The Crotica gives all due credit to Captain Davis for his humane interference to save the lives of Walker and his followers, The Boletin Oficial of Leon, of April the 15th, states that when the Filibuster party left Castillo Fort on ths 5th, without attacking it, they left a paper fastened to a tree with a bayonet containing the following words:_ "James Bowie and E. J. Calhoun present their compliments to the Commander of Fort Castillo. Good by, friends. Warriors, remain In peace-the war is over." Walker and a portion of his officers were taken to Panama by the United States' sloop of war St. Mary's, and others obtained passage by the steamer Panama. They were, it was said, allowed, by the terms of capitulation, to leave Rivas with their sidearms, and the men were to be sent home at the expense of the Costa Ricans. General fHenningsen, Colonel Titus, and some others of Walker's mcn, 'were passengers to New York by the Illinois, and the papers of that city are filled with the accounts of the capitulation. General Henningsen had prepared a statement of the forces engaged in the Nicaraguan war, in which he thus states the relative strength of Walker's army and that of the enemy, and the relative loss in killed and wounded:- "Force of Walker from the time of his landing in Nicaragua to the 1st of May, 1857, a space of nearly two years (exclusive of Lockridge's force) 2,518 Total force of the allies, exclusive of 1,200 Costa Ricans said to have been on the river ... ... 17,800 "(Of this number 11,500 men were from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, and San Salvador.) Total killed and wounded of Walker's force, ... 850 Total allies, killed and wonaded ... ... ... 5,860 This is without counting on either side those who died of disease. The mortality in the enemy's camp was very great. Tvo geaerals died at the siege of Granada; and in April, 1856, of 2,400 men who retreated from Rivas with Mora, at least 1,000 died of cholera, only 500 entering San Jose with him. To tbis force of 2,518, the total forceWalker hadunder arms during twoyeanrs.sincehislandinginthe country, it is hardly necessary to add the armed citizens who fought at Granadaand Rivas, becausetheywere, with a "core of exceptions, disbanded soldiers; and it must be borne in mind that, if ulany unwounded died, a large proportion of the wounded recovered. It is estimated that during two years, of 2,500 enlisted or holding commissions, about 1,000 were killed or died of wounds or sickness, 700 deserted, 250 wvere discharged, 430 were at Rivas on the 1st of May, and 80 in garrison or in steamers on the river. Total, 2,465-leaving 53 unaccounted for." The Neta York Sun, in reference to the above details, remarks- "We think that the General, perhaps from imperfect data, underrates the number of men who joined Walker during the Nicarguan struggle, and is led by exaggerated statements of the enemy's forcea in the different engage. ments to overstate their numbers, and the number of their hilled and wounded. Probably, in this Walker-Nicaraguan war more than 2,000 Americons and 6,000 or 7,000 Cantrat Americans have perished." General Walker and staff arrived at New Orleans on the evening of the 27th, in the steamer Empire City. The telegraphic announcement of the fact says,- "Ten thousand people were present to receive Genera Walker, who was n"companied by Colonel Jacques, Mr. Pilcher, and Mr. Trner, agent of the asociated press, in a carriage, to the St. Charles Hotel, where General Walker mode a speech, expressing his thanks for the splendid reception given him, saying, that in the mss before him he receognized the American love of liberty, and assured them that victory was till sare. The greatest excitement pre. vails in the city, and the St. Charleg Hotel is besieged by t' ousands, anxious and eager to Bee and hear the General He was obliged ' .neak twoe beforo tho Crowd was eaifled. General Walker surrendered because Captain Davis nignified his intention of seizing the schooner Granada, which held his (Walker's) reserve. General Walker wa5 kept a olose prisoner by the United States' Commodore at Pnae, notwithstanding the terms of capitulation, which nllowed him and his officers their liberty, and gave them the privilege of retaining their side-arms." Another despatch from New Orleans, of the 28th, ays:- "1 General Walker's friends confidently assert that he will go back to Nicaragua in 30 to 60 days, with plenty of men and means. He and his staff attended by invitation this evening Spaldinges Amphitheatre. The house was densely crowded, and when General Walker appeared the house rose and cheered him most enthusiastically, the bands playing the national airs. General Walker will address a pubho meeting here to-morrow night, on 'Neutral Ground."' Additional news from Central America had been received at New York. The Costa Rican authorities, it was understood, had authorized arrangements to be made for transporting all the Filibusters that remained in the country to the United States. It was also understood that a treaty had been concluded between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, providing for the speedy resumption of traffic over the transit route. The reported division of Nicaragua was contradicted, and a plan was on foot for re-establishing the old Central American Confederation. A despatch from Washington, of the 28th, says:- "The excitement about Walker's return is intense, though not a word has been received from him by his friends here, nor has tho Secretary of the Navy received any despatch on the subjec. The Navy D epartment do not credit the report of the capitulation with Captain Davis, of the St. Mary's, he having, It is said, no authority to entertain any such proposition. It is understood however, that Captain Davis was instructed to render Walker such assistance as he might need; and thethreat to take the sobooner Granada was only a blind to afford the latter a pretext for surrendering. It is confidently predicted that Walker will return in 90 days at the head of 5,000 men." From Panama we have a rumour that the islands in the Bay of Panama had been ceded to England, as also the tonnage duty accruing on American vessels in the Isthmus ports, but this requires confirmation. An extra session of the Legislature had been called, it was supposed for the purpose of removing the captal of the State to an inland town. The Governor had issued a proclamation exhorting all citizens to be peaceable in the present situation of affairs with the United States. Advices from California, though two weeks later, contain no news of importance. The State Legislature adjourned sine dieonthe 30th of April. Mining intelligence was favourable, but agricultural prospects, owing to the drought, were not so encou- raging. Lieutenant S'rain, distingui6hed for sufferings and heroic perseverance as a leader in the Dalienl Exploring Expedition tent out by the American Government a few years ago, died at Aspinwall on the night of the 15th ult., and was buried next day in the Mount E opo ,cemetery, the funeral being attended by most of the officers and 6ailors of the Cyane and Wabash Amserican ships of war. iavannao h dates are to the 28th nit. The weather was delightful, and the public health continued exceedingly good. Sugars were s till in demand, and molasses improving. In freights there was a better feeling, without change in rates. A derpatch from Waihington, dated the 29th of May, says:-. "The Secretary of war and General Scott have been activey engaged for Some days, and have about completed the arrangements to send a Largo military force to Utah,e under the command of General Harney. Orders have just been issued to the necessary staff departments to have the following troopsin readiness as SCOn as possible:-2d Rlegimeat of Dragoons, 5th and 10th Regiments of Infantry, and Captain Phelps's battery of Light Artillery, making upwards of 2,000 troops. The administration are still without a Governor for UJtah." From Oregon we learn that there were indications of another Indian outbreak. According to a report from the Great Salt Lake the schism in the Mormon church had assumed a tormidable character. Brigham Young was said to have deserted the Tabernacle and remained shut up in his own house, guarded night and day by his friends. He was afraid to show himself in public. Advices from the Sandwich Islands are to the 4th of April, but they are unimportant. A very severe earthquake shock was felt on the Island of Hawaii on the 24th of March. The ootton-market at New York on the 20th was quiet, bat firm. Holders received the foreign news in a favourable light, while purchasers regarded it to be less favourable than they had anticipated; hence transactions were restricted to a few hundred bales, without quotable change in prices. The news checked the upward tendency in flour, especially for the common and lowergrades, while buyers were unwilling to purchase freely without some concession in prices. Sales were consequently moderate, without change of moment in prices. Wheat was in good demand, and prime lots were firm. Indiana red sold at $1 67c. ; fair Western ditto, at $1 62c.; Canadian do., at $1 62c.; and medium to choice Southern and Missouri white ranged from $1 75c. to $1 80c. Pork sold at $23 90c., with small lots at $23 95c. Sugars were quiet, while holders stood out for previous current rates, regarding the fature movements of the trade with much confidence,while buyers were unwiUing to enter the market freely without some relaxation in prices; hence the sales were confined to small jobbing lots, without noticeable change in quotations. Coffee was quiet, but firm. Freights were inactive and rates somewhat irregular to British ports, while engagements were moderate. The stock-market opened with a strong upward tendency on the 29th, and with consiaerable activity in all the leading railroad stocks. New York Central, Erie, Cleveland and Toledo, Michigan, Southern, and, in fact, all the Western railroad stocks were particularly active, and most of them advanced a fraction or so at the first Board. Pennsylvania Coal improved i per cent.; New York Central, 1; Erie, 1; Reading i; Illinois Central, i; Cleveland and Pitts8urg, 2; Galena and Chicago, .1 ; Cleveland and Toledo, 2; Chicago and Rock Isana, t Milwaukie and Mississippi, 1-i; Michigan Southern Guaranteed Preference 10 per cent. scrip feU off I per cent. The advices from London by the Arabia had a favourable eF.ect on Illinois Central Stock; sales were made at 140, but the stock closed at 139*-; Michigan Southern Old Deferred Stock hung very heavy in the neighbourhood of 60 per cent. ; Cleveland and Toledo was quite buoyant, and sold freely at an advance; it opened at 66 and closed at 66 per cent., with sales of nearly 4,000 shares. At the second Board the market for some stocks was pretty well sustained, with active sales; Cleveland and Pittsburg advanced 2 per cent., closing at 49, sellers, three days. Cleveland and Toledo opened at 66 cash, and closed at 66, buyers, 60 days. After the Board Michigan Southern Old Deferred sold at 58i cash, and was of'red freely at that price; the Guaranteed Prefeience was heavy at 88 per cent, with small +les; Erie was tolerably steady, and closed witb&:an upward tendency; of Ohio Life and Trust sales were made at 101 per cent., cash.

COURT OF COMATOx COUNCIL. Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business. THE EM ANKMENT OP THE THAME. The Court uroceeded to the consideration of the letter of the Clerk of the Metropolitan Board of Works relative to the embankment of the river Thames between Westminster and London bridges; and upon the motion of Mr. Deputy HARRisoN, who said that the subjeot was one of great importance and interest to the whole metropolis, the document was referred to the Navigation Commsittee to consider and report, with authority to confer with the Metropolitan Board on the question. ALTERATION OF MIARIET-DAY. Mr. IL L TAYLOn brought up a report on the petition of the butchers attending the New Metropolitan Cattle. Market, and recommending an alteration of the market-day from Friday to Thursday. The report said:- It appewas that the InoonverSuce is moeparicul felt In the supply ofsclves andlambe. These aimalsaivingstralr termint are veryhas.y transferred to the market, aud tbeuce to the butchera' premises, whereby the nimals are obliged to be kiUed In a heated and feverish stte; but it the market were heldon Thursday ample time vwould be given for the animal, to rest quiet for such a period as would reuder the meat and offal more valuable, and they would bh in much better coudition for sale and ooncumption.

Ing snob market, and afflord better opportunity for Its eHaelet regis The report was unanimously agreed to, and it was referred to the .karets Improvement Committee to give such directions and take such steps as might bo necessary to carry the proposed aramngement into effect. Mr. R. L TAYLOR said, in answer to a question from Deputy Barnard, that a report would be brought up on the next Court, stating the substance of the meetings which had taken place between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and a deputation from tho committee on the subject of the establshment of a dead meat market, a question which bad not yet been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. WIDENING OF ALDGATE Deputy CHRSTE brought up a report in respect of a proposed improvement by widening AIdgate. The report recommennimg such improvement had been agreed to in the Court of Sewers, by which Court it was considered necessary that the qieation should have the concurrence of the Court of Common Council. Hle impressed upon the Court the necessity for improvement in Aldgatc, on account of ihe enormously increased traffic produced by the vicinity of the railroads and docks, and said it would be quite impossible to surmount the difficulties of transit if measures were not taken to widen the approaches. Several members started up and stated that the districts which they represented had much stronger claims upon the consideration of the Court than that to which the attention of the Court had been jusbt attracted. It was urged, too, in objection to the report, that the funds of the corporation were not in a state to bear the weight of such heavy ciemands as were made from all sides, azcd it was suggested that the question should be postponed until the Court wore in possession of the expected report of the Finance Committee. The re rtvasaigreed to, and itwvas referred tothe City Lands tommittee to commnunicate with the Court of Sewers upon the subject. THE CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL. Alderman HALEpresented a reportfromtheCityof London School Committee. After some allusion to former important benefaetions the report says:- " We havo now the high gratlfication of bringing under tho notice o the Court au Instance in whlch the preeedlig examples of kindness and libealUty have been nobly followed by another of the principal in oorprated comparles of this city the Worshpful Company of ;rocera having lately honoured us with a omraumualation wth~ they had resolved it grant to the school two exhbitbuo"s of Ã¯Â¿Â½50 per annum each for the enLouragement of ciasslol unl other studies lirrespective oc matbematics), to be bestowed, Uke all the other exhibitions and scholarship, upon ptipil of at least tbree yers' standing who shall displa the greatest proficiency ioan examinatIon to be conducted by tho examiners of the school, and to tha tenable either at Oxford or Cambrid o fora)lpod of tour yeara, while qualifying for a degree.

Mr. Deputy DAKLN, in seconding the motion that the report be agreed to, said he rejoiced to find that the example set by the Goldsmiths Company and the Merehant Taylors Company had been followed by another liberal company, and he trusted that the other wealthy corporations of the city would soon give their assistance and contribute to raise the City of London School to the level of Merchant Taylors and St. Paul's schools, to which it was rapidly approaching in reputation. (Hear, hear.) Mr. ELLIOTT inquired whether the limitation of the exhibitions to mathematics nnd classics was at the instance of the Grocers Company, the donors thereof, because if such were not the cane, it was much to be regretted that the studies of youths should now-a-days be oonfined to the most useless, instead of being applied to the most useful subjects. Latin was obsolete and exhausted, but German was in use, and full of valuable knowledge. Greek was obsolete, but Chinese was the language of 300,000,000 men with whom our commercial and literary intercourse would be greatly extended, and very soon. We should encourage the study of langua;es which living men spoke, and not of the languages of nations long gone by. The report was then unanimously agreed to, ordered to be printed in the minutes, as well as prominently for circulatn among the members of the Court, and to be referred back to the committee for the purpose of being carried into effect as to the recommendations contained in it. A long discussion took place upon the report of the City Lands Committee recommending the contribution of the sum of 50I0. towards the expense tobe incurred by the Commissioners of Sewers in constructing an iron culvert from the mouth of the sawer near Paul's-wbarf. Au amendment, reduudng the sum from 500Z. to 3001, rwas ultimately adopted. A peti ion was presented by Alderman HumpiHiRY from Messrs. h. M. Rothschild and Sons, for an extension of the lease of their premises in New-court, St. Swithin's-lane. -Referred to a committee. Mr. TIIORPE, the Chairman of the Navigation Committee, presented a petition from Mr. Nathaniel Saunders, the water-bailifflof the city of London, praying that his office of sub conservator might be recognized in the Bill for Regulating the Conservancy of the riverThames. The CnAIRmAN stated that by some oversiglt the office of Mr. Saunders, their excellent officer, who had been indefatigable in tho performance of his duties for a term exceeding 33 years, had been omitted in the Bill now before Parliament, and it was for the purpose of having that mistake rectified that the application to the Court was made. The petition was-referred to the Consolidated Committee, with directions to do therein as they should beadvised, Mr. Doputy.LoTT presented & petition from James Pierse, for the restoration of property taken from the petitioner, and handed over tothe Sheriffs of London on his conviction for larceny. The petition stated that the prosecutor had lost nothing; that the property of which the prisoner had been deprived was his own, and that the proceeds of the sale would enable him to take his family to Australia, where he might have an opportunity of becoming a useful member of soieity; and that Baron Martit, who had tried him, advised him to apply to the Treasury for the restoratlouof the property, and the Treastuy had referred him to the city, the sheriffs of which had claimed it as their right. Mr. Deputy LOTT strongly and most humanely urged the Court to interfere upon the subject, but it was stated to be wholly out of their jurisdiction, and was of course rejected. After the transaction of some other business the Court adjourned.
THE "BEDUCED" CAPTAINS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI!MlS. Sir,-Can nothing be done for the captains, the victims of tbe reduction, who still remain on half-pay? Take my own case-there are dozens of others worse off, I know - I hope my letter will benefit them as well as I srved in the Crimea, and was placed on half-pay on the 10th of November last. All my applications for employ. mint have been met with one reply. In every Gazete I see my juniors promoted, and if I were brought into full pay in my former regiment to-morrow I should rank below one of my own subalterns. Sy cue is, as I say, only one of Enmy-the ljustice a obvious, the remedy equally so. If we must be kept on half-payuntil vicauoies oomur otherwise than by purchase in" he orps fiomirhichlia were reduced, let us at least be permitted to take our rank among the captains, above thore lieutenants who may havo been promoted betwvieen the periods of our reduction and re-employment.

SPORTING I1NTELLIGENCE. ASCOT-HEATH RACES.-THE CUP DAY. rCople wno were determined to visit Ascot on the " Cap Day" felt no uneasiness when they heard that Wednesday had been wet and stormy, for they knew the Queen would be present, and experience taught them that by pomo for. tunate chanceo fair weather always attends Her Majesty's excursions abroad. No wonder was therefore excited by the propitious change in the skiey influences. Although the morning was an alternation of clouds and sunsbine, yet the female faith was large, and "a store of ladies" in all their gay and variegated summer attire thronged the Waterloo station, and were conveyed in rapid succession to the Heath. The platform in London was made quite picturesque by ihe man y-coloured dresses of the ladies who promenaded it, and who, as they were not attending a "Drawing-room," but only required seats in a railway carriage, ran no risk of having their dresses torn and toiUaes disarranged owing to a crus hing crowd for whose accommodation no provision had been made. Trains were despatched at frequent iutervals, and from the excellent arrangements con' fasion was avoided, and the excursionists experienced little inconvenienco or annoyance. Still it must not be surmised that the ready facilities for reaching the Heath fur nished by the railway diminished the glories of the road. Large numbers of people were conveyed by the Great Western route to Windsor, whence they posted through the park to Ascot ; while the relays of horses along the road fromLondon, and the resuscitatedpost-boys who were in attendance, reminded people of " the good old times." The Cup Day was, in fact, surpassingly suocessful. The supply of sport was ample, the weather fine, and the attendance of company equalled that on the occasion of the visit of he late Emperor Nicholas of Russia. The space opposite the Grand Stand was thicldy clustered over with carriages filled with ladies, while the lswn and baloony of the Grand Stand and the private stands, from the varied hues of ladies' dresses. glistened and flashed in the sunlight. By 1 o'clock the bell rung out for clearing the course, and about half an hour afterwards the Royal Standard was hoisted, and the stir and excitement among the spectatoLf showed ta the Queen was approaching. Soon the Royal corwge was seen slowly descending the hill and coming along the New Mile. It was preceded by the Earl of Bess. borough and the Royal Huntsman, and, in fact, the procession was formed in the same order that we have so frequently described. Lord Palmerston, however, acoompanied it on horseback, and wherever he was reoognized the most lively interest and curiosity were excited. The names of the distinguished personages who formed the cavalcade vill be found on reference to the "Court Circular." Blink Bonny, the Derby and Oaks victress, opened the proceedings by cantering over for the 50 sovs Sweepstakes, and at the request of Her Majesty the mare was afterwari3 walked round the enclosluein front of the Queen's Stand, and was evidently regarded with much curiosity by the Royal visitors. The Gold Cop was run for at 3 o'clock. The incidents which marked the race are fully described below. It was in favour of Lord Zetland's Skirmisher, who wa ridden by Charlton, the rider of Blink Bonny for both Derby and Oaks. Although the prize is designated the " Gold Cup," yet .e is in reality silver, and we are fain to confess that it is somewhat inferior to the race cupps which have been coz. tested for at Ascot in previous years. Just after the decision of the VisitorE' Plate Hf r Majesty and suite took their depature, and loud cheeia attended their progress down the Course. The spectators also now began to move off, and within an hour after the last race only a few stragglers and belated vWisitors were left with the police and the gipsles to enjoy the pleasant evening on the Heath. The "Court Circular" will furnish the names of those distinguished persons who attended the Queen. Among many other fashionable visitors were Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke [of Cambridge, the Duke of Beaufort, the Dake of Montrose, his Excellency the Russian Ambassador, Lord Wilton, Lord Londesborough.

After a little delay he remouuted and joined the horses at the starting post. Much anxiety and compassion were evinced for Bartholomew by the spectators, for it will be remembered that he was one of the most severely injured jockeys in the fearful accident at Goodwood last year. His second mount since that occurrence was tc - day. Mr. Hibburd lost no time in forming the horses in a line, and swon despatched them from the poet Chevalier d'Industrie, who was started to "serve" Rogerthorpe, immediately rushed to the front, with Saunterer "ptlling double" second, and these two showed the way past the stand, Pretty Boy going on third, Skir- misher fourth, Tasmania fifth, Wardermarke and Leaming. ton next, Rogerthorpe bringing up the rear. After round. ng the top turn Chevalier d'lndustrie increased his lead upwards of 20 lengths, Saunterer being Eecond, with Skirmisher about a couple of lengths behind him, Pretty Boy and Tasmania running abreast next, Warlock being last but oue, and Gemma di Vergy last. In this order they disappeared behind the hill, and on coming into sight Chevalier d'Industrie was still seen with the lead and Saunterer second, Pole Star having drawn, into the third place, with Skirmisher fourth, clear of his horses, and Gemma di Verjy heading the rock, Warlock being " whipper in." As they ronuded the turn by the brick-kilns Skirmisher began to creep for. ward, and soon joined Saunterer, and these two were now in close company with Chevalier d'induatrie. On entering the straight the Chevalier had completed his work nd dropped back, leaving Saunterer with a sight led, Skirmisher taking second place,with oleStar andGemmadi Vergy in close attendance, They ran thus to the half dis. tance, where Skirmiaher headed Saunterer.

ROYAL BRITISH BANK. ABREsT OF M: Hu4PmRY BRoWN, xx.M.P. FOR TEwKmBURY. The prompt and energetic steps taken by Messrs. Link. later and Iackwood, to whom the Attorney-General hbs Intruted the conduct of the prosecution of the directors and general manager of this bank, have led to the capture of MIlr. Iuumphery Brown. We learn that he is now in custody upon tho warrants, by each of which he is requireato put in bal for 4,000h,, with two sureties for 2%00l. eah. Sureties for 8,0001., besides his own recognizances for 8,0007., will therefore be required before he is released. The Hon. John Stapleton, MP. for Berwick, and the Iothers who have been arrested have already given bail to a similar amount. Within a short time it is bolieved that all the parties impliated will be secured. Those who have not yet been apprehended are under strict surveillance abroad, and will be brought to this country as soon a, the neceMary arrangements can be made. Three ex-officio informations have been filed at the Crown-office by the Attorney-General, bat itis not expected that the trials will take place nntil next November, as the present term ends to-day. Sir Frederic Thesiger, assisted by mr. Welsby and Mr. Joseph Brown, will lead for the Crown unless the recent appointment of the Solicitor.Generai should interfere with that arrangement. If so it is sup, posed thatthe ttorney-Generalwouldhimelflead. Several of the leading counsel have been retained for the directors, and among them Sir Fitzroy Kelly, Mr. Bovill Q.C., lir. Edwin James, QC., and M1r. Huddleston. It is not known who wil have the honour of oonducting the defenoe df Mr. Humphery Brown.
THE WATER IX Sr. JAMES'SPARE, TO TUE EDILOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am unable to perceive that Messrs. Eston and Amoe have discovered either false theories or reports in the correspondenoe which has appeared in T7he Tmes with re. spect to the pumping in St. Jamees Park. No doubt the parties interested in the surrounding wells are very much obliged to Messrs. Eastan and Amos for assuring them that they will obtain water if they sink deeper. It maust be very atifying to th owrners of shaiowwells about 12 or 14 feet dcep to know that if they sink about 400 feet through the London clay they will then obtain abundanoe of water, as the great brewers have done. hessrs. Easton and Amos express their opinion that when the woorks shall be ompleted, and the engmne working only 10 or 12 ours a-day to supply the lakes, the wells will pro hbTby nnt then be affected. This remains to be seen, but .what do thuy mean hTsupplying the lakes? Is it intended: o abstract from the Westn Wster wells sufficient water to feed the Serpentine.as well as the ake ina St James's Park ? Tast intended to supply aUltha stsnd.postsin the park, the: magnifioent fountains in Trafalgar-squars, and all the other places which are now dependent on the works in Orange-street ? This may, indeed, be the intention of Her Majesty's Commisioners, as I observe a large main-Pipe, about 15 inches in diamster, is laid acros the lake from Duck Island, as if for the purpose of oonveying the water to a distance. If thi really be intended, the prospect before the owners of wells in this neighbourhood is much more serious than appeared at first sight. With every respect for the esperienoe of Xessrs Easton and Amos as well-sinkers, I still contend (I believe in common with every geologist) thAt the surface of the Tondon clay beneath the drift gravel is extremely irregula. This, however, has really nothing whatever to do with the question of the wells being affected. Although Messrs. Easton.and Amos repudiate the statement which assigns 5,00 gallons a-minute, or more than 7,000,000 gallons aday, asthe quantity now"being pumped in Duck Island, they still, as I understand, assert that the engine and pumps are capable of lifting half this quantity. Now, it has been estimated on good authority that the unitedyield of all thea yndspring vels in Londonison 3,00,0 gallons a.dy; and therefore It would be very Fatisfactory if Messrs Easton and Amos would state the powerof the engines and the capacity of the purups which, aecording to themu, are raising more than this quautity in Duck Iland alone. I an, Sir, your yen obedient servn. SAMUETL. FPITT1=7 Ã¯Â¿Â½, rarx-streot, w eetminster, S. W., June IL TO TRIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Mer. Easton and Amos are wroug in concluding thAt the water they pump up in St. Jamee~s Park comes from the Thames because they get much nora when it is hi water tban whon it is low water in the river; was so at the foundation of Miss Burdett Couttas churh in Westminster. .

Major BIRD having briefly aclnowledged the health of the Iinces of Oude, which had been drunk with much warmth, The Rev. Dr. HzSSgY returned thanks for tbeWtoast of "The Merchant Taylors!

He said it ws morethan300years ago since the company, seingthat education must and ought to prevail, had instituted the Merchaut Taylore' School, and from that time-the time of Eliabeth-down to the present day it led never failed to send forth both good citizens, sound Christians, and steadfast Churchmen. Butthey could not now abut their eyes to the fact that all the educational institutions of the coutry were upon their trial and must be prepared to accommodate themselves to the progressive spint of the times, or e left behind them altogether. The Merchant Taylors' COmpany had been among the first of the great corporate bodies to foresee this, and under their sanction such improvements had been made in the educational system of this school as would tend to its perfoct development and hear fruits in promoting the general berefit of the community. In the great race of progrs the hlercbait Taylora' Schooi wvould not be found eindhand or its masters wianting in their duty either to it or to the nobIe company to which theschool owedits einoe. Mhea ru of oE havinig p rposed the health orf Th Chairman," aind the Marquis of SxALasURY formally acknowledged the toast of " The House of LordN" the Master gave the health of "The Bench of Bishops," coupling with it the name of the Bishop of Oxford. The Right Rev. PxrRTP, in renly, thanked the master of the company most sinoerely for the pleasure he bad derived and the splendid hospitality he had received from his visit. From his close connexion with the University and diooess of Oxford he was fuly able to appreciate the extent and importanom of the benefits conferred by the Merchant Taylors School, and hut the other day he had had the pleasure of admitting to a cure of souls its second master, a gentleman who was deeply and extensively read in all that related to sared and profane learning. He (the Bishop of Oxford) zejoiced in the wealth, honour, and prosperity of those great guilds and corporations of the city of wichc the Merlhant Taylorse was one of the chief. If it was not now, as it onoehad been, the nurse snd shield of trade and commerce, yet its great offioe in the city had not passed away, but it was rather like tho member of society who inhisearlierdayshadhad to fght and struggle his way upwards till he attained a high position, when he could afford to rest and become the dispenser of honours, dignities, and princely hospitality. So its wearith this omf y, which, however, both 4ow and in its earlieet infancy,tad alsrys been ditAinguised nat I for its unshaken loyalty to the Crown than as one of the most firm defenders of the great liberal institution7s of the country.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. Lord LYNDHURST gave notice that either on the re. port or the third reading of this Bill he should agaia propose the amendment which lie moved when the Blil was in cornnittee. The Earl of DONOUGaMORE gave notice that at one or other of these stages he should repeat the amendment wvhich he proposed to the 19th clause of the Bill as it originally stood. SMOKE NUISANCE (SCOTLAND) ABATEMENT BILL. Lord KINNTAIRD moved the second reading of this BilL He proposed to confine its provisions to Scotland, in| the hope that when its good effects had been manifested I it would be adopted in other parts of the kingdom. No doubt, there were provisions in various looal improve. mnent Acts which gave power to abate the smoke nuisance, but they had been found inoperative. He knew of one case in which an inspector had been appointed for the purpose of carrying this Drovision into operation, but the people whose =anufactories snade allthe smokewere the authorities bef ,re wbom the complaint would have had to belaid, so that all he dared to do was occasionally to bring an information against Fome small delinquent, while the great offenders escaped rltngether. The only objection which could be brought against the Bill was the expense of altering the furnaces, hut it had been found by experience that this was very snmall, while the saving in fuel and the increased steam Power which was gained very soon repaid It all with good interest. Iu one establishment near London' the consamption of coal had been reduced from 25 cwt. to 18 cwt. a-day, and he knew of a colliery in Scotland where an alteration costing Wot. had produced a saving of 3001. a-year. But, even supposing there was no saving, Parliament had yet a right to enforce these alterations for the sake of the towns which were afflicted with these smoke nuisances. He had left a blank in the Bill in which to insert the amount of population of which the towns should be to which the Bill should apply. Perhaps it would not be advisable to extend it to small towns and villages. Lord CAMPBELLsaid that, having had the honour of representing the city of Edinburgh for several Parliaments, he took a great interest in this Bill. That city went by two names-one the "Modern Athens," the other " Asild lieekie"-the first denoting the unexampled beauty of the buildings of the city, the other the heavy clouds of smoke by wbich they v ere overwhelmed and obscured. There was no doubt that this Bill recommended itself to that of which his countrymen were very fond-economy, for the smoke was the unignited part of the fuel, and was so much loss. As to the practicability of the consumption of smoke, there could he no question, for while Attorney-General he had granted a variety of patents by which it was easily and effectually carried out. All that was wanted was a little vigour in the administration of the law. Lord RAVBENSWORTH said that any one standing on tbo High-level Bridge at Newcastle-on-Tyne must be perfectly anazesd at the extent, the denseness, and the variety Tf fs esmoke v liich hung over the town. There wasa clause in tl e Impr(,vement Act of that town for putting down the Dn isanee; but it had been found inoperative for the reason state(l by the uoble lord. The chief creators of the nuisance vere the persons who appointed the inspectors and who would have to decide on any complaint which he might bring Lefore them. Tbere could be no doubt that in consequence of the measures which had been taken with regard to the consumption of smoke a great improvement had been eifected in the atmosphere of this metropolis-so much so that at this season of the year the atmosphere of the metropolis was not much inferior to that of Paris. He trusted that the attention of the Government and the Legislature would be directed to the improvement of all the manufacturng districts in this respect, and that vigorous measures would be taken to suppress what was a serious and growing evil. Lord REDESDALE regretted that the Bill did not apply to all parts of the united kingdom. At the same time he thought the provision with regard to informations was defective. The duty of giving information devolved on thr. e parties, and experience sbowed, that where three parties ad to discharge a duty it was never well done. Earl FITZ WILLIAMI was understood to concur in the view taken by the noble baron who last addressed the House. Lord KINNAIRD observed that the magistrates might atct on the information of any party, provided they thought it sufficient. The Duke of RICaMOND suggested that information should be laid before the sheriffs of counties, as millowners who were magistrates might sometimes be placed in an awkward position by being caUed on to insfict fines upon those who were their own colleagues. The Bill was then read a second time. CINQUE PORTS BILL. The Cinqute Ports Act Amendment BiU passed throngu committee. FRAUDULENT BREACHES OF TRUST. Lnrd ST. LEONARD'S rose to call the attention of their lordships to one of the most important of the social questious that now occupied the attention of Parliament -he meant the law as it was now administered regarding trustena. Her Majesty's Govermnent, as the House was aware, had brought in a Bill to punish criminally fraudulent breaches of trust. To that it was impossible any one could object; bat the difficulty was in confining the measure to what were really fraudulent breaches of trust, and not comprehending ordinary breaches of trust which implied misapplication of money, and yet not such misapplication as should render a trustee criminally liable. (Hear.) If ordinary breaches of trust were to be made punishable with, seven years' penal servitude, the only check being that the consent of the Attorney or Solicitor-General was necessary to prosecution, he believed the utmost difficulty would be experienced in getting men of competence and statioa to act in tho capacity of trustees. (Hear, hear.) He begged the House to reflect that the present moment, whein ats of undoubtedly great misconduct had excited public animadversion, was not the best time for legislating upon the subject. Any measure affecting the position of trustees should be carefuly considered, and when the noble anid learned lord on the woolsack announced, on the Part of the Government, their intention to introduce a Bill for the punishment of fraudulent breaches of trust, he (Lord &. eonard's) had suggested that means should be adopted te protect trustees acting bond fide from the hard measure of justice which was now meted out to them by the courts o! 'Equity. His noble friend had expressed an opinion that is, would be impossible to franme a measure which woul I have that end, but he (Lord St. Leonard's) had bslieved it to be possible, and therefore had prepared a Bill which he proposed to submit to their lorhships' coasideration. Trusts were of various kinds, and nothing was more easY thau for a trastee to be guilty of a breach of trust without any improper intention ; indeed, perhaps nino-tenths of the breaches of trust that were committ d arose from a coinpliance by the trustee with the wishe3 of those for whose benefit he was appointed to the office. In mLany cases the trustee bad either to commit the error or ecKposed himself to the ilifeeling and reproach of a family whose goodwill he would be desirous of preserving, Then, sgain, in many cases a trustee received money for which there was no immediate investment o: disposition, and for safety he paid it into his o wv account at his banker's, which was unquestionably an improper proceeding. Those acts, however, were continually done, and he believed that solicitors who re eived moneys for their clients paid those moneys into their general account at their banker's. While he aprovedhighy any atterupt to punish fraudulent breaches ofrust, he repeated his belief that it was absolutely necessary to guard agaanst any oppression upon trustees who performed their duties in good faith. One plan of reconciling the law as it stool with the object sought to be attained by the new Bill was that trustees should be paid for their labour, but to that proposition he was decidedly opposed. Another proposition was made when the South Sea Coin. pany came to an end, that a trustee and e:ecutor society bhould be established. He had the satisfaction of aiding in the reection of that measure. Afterwards a private co,uI-any brought in a Bill with a similar object, which was also rejected, and recently another company had been started to act as trustees and executors upon limited liability. When their lordships remembered what had happened in the Tip. perary Bank, and more recently in the Great Northern Rail. way, where a clerk with 2001. bad lived, to the knovwledge ,of is employers, at the rate of a prince, but who was finally found to have defrauded them of 220,0001., he would aik hat greater casfty could thvere be to thef, ceuevie tru lts wsntoth East Inpona r - an StIadire weXvter 2tO0;e unioaw was nt putuponaiiore Proper footing as regarded upright trutees, the inevitable result would he that no man wo ild becomie a trustee or an executor. He would new iriefly state what were the provisions which he proposed to insert in the Bl that he was about to lay upon the table, It had been decided that when a trustee innocently comnitted a breach of trust without any possible benefit to himself, and in the rEsult there was both a profiT, and a loss, he was notbat liberty to set the one agicnst the other, but the parsons neyficially interested were allowed to pocket all the profit of the transactiin, and to hca upon the trustee to bear all the loss. He might mention a case to their lordships. A gentleman residing the East ndies gaver2,0001.upon loan to the East India Company. It bore interest at the rate of 10oupe cent., and the company were not bound to pay it off ittil the e piration of 10 yea, The gentleWal received the interest himself while he remained in India, and uvon -his retTirn home desired it to be forwarded to hmm in London. He made his will, directing al his property to be converted into money, and the money to be invested, The interet he gave to his wife during ther Ille, and then his whole capital was togo to another ly. Upon his deAth the trustee found the paper -of the company for the 2,0001.,.ind ascertained that the interest bad been regularlY sent to London. Their lordshsips voztld Aeb4erve that the capit-al could not be damaged, bacau..V it was to be paid off at the end of 10 years. Well, the testator himself having received the interest, the trustoe very inncenlypai th 1 pe cet,to hewidow during her lif, nd then te persne toheeminder,eehavng .nc .betd ie ilaans h rse,ws a could not have called in the capital of the loan, he ought to have sold it. The demand was made good against hiLm in court. It turned out, howevet, very extraordinarily that in oDnsequence of the funds having fallen at the time when the loan was paid oS, a profit of SOOf. was made by the investmont; in. other words, if the trustee had sold the claim upo, the Company at the death of the testator and then investi,d the money, as it was contended suocess. fluUy he oaght to have done, ib would have brought 8001. less. But is was held that he could neo set the profit a ainst the loss, and the result was that he Was compeUed to repay the interest which he had paid to tio widow, amounting to a sum of 1,0001. or 1,1001., without being allowed to taks the benefit of one farthing of the SOO. which ho had gained by the delay in realizing the capitol. Now, the first clause of his Bill iet that case, for it provided that if a trasso e in the execution of his trust should innocently do au act uoon which there should be a loss) but upon wich there should also be a gain, he should be alowed to set the one against the other. The second clause had reference to a different point. Where a trustee was directed to convert leaseholds for example, to invest the money in Three per Cent&, and to pay the dividends to the tenant for life,, but, instead of doing so, allowed the tenant for life to enjoy the property unconverted, he was liable for all the rents which were received by the tenant for life beyond the amount of the 3 per cent. dividend. He held, however, that it was the bounden duty of the person entitled to the remainder to look after the execution of the trust and the investment of the money. The second clause, therefore, provided that if a trustee should innocently make an overpayment the person in remainder, if he was aware of the overpayment and had not objected to it, should not be at liberty to allow the trustee to pay his father or mother perhaps more than he ought, and then upon the death of the tenant for life to compel him to repay the excess. The clause went further. It had been held that where a trustee had innocently paid too much to the tenant for life, and then been obliged to repay the difference to the person in remainder, he was not entitled to proceed against the person to whom he had made the overpayment in order to recover what he had overpaid. Now, that was a defect in the existing la v for, although it would no doubt be a great hardbhip to tell a lady after she had innocently received for a number of years more than ought to have been paid to her that she was liable to be proceeded againstforthe excess, yet their lordships would see that there were two innocent parties, and that while the one had enjoyed the money, the other had not. It appeared to him that the person who ought to make the repayment was the one who ad received the money, and therefore he had inserted a provision to that effect in his second clause. The third cause was a very simple one. Trustees were often required to do certain acts under powers of attorney granted by persons residing abroad, and the object of his third clause was to provide that a trustee so acting should not be responsible for what he might do after the death of the person granting the power of attorney, if he was not aware that the party had died at the time. The next provision had reference to the investment of trust money. It frequently happened that trustees were forced to change investments by those who desired to increase their incomes; but it had been decided that a trustee was not justified in doing an act which might turn out to be not strictly regular, although he might have taken the opinion of the highest counsel at the bar and acted upan it. He proposed, there. fore, that if a trustee took the opinion of a Queen's counsel, and gave notice to the parties interested of his intention to invest in a particular way he should be indemnified for the act. So much for errors of commission. He would now state how he proposed to deal with those of omission. A trustee was often bound by the rule of equity to do an act-for examnple, to convert property. He proposed that when there was no direction, and the trustee innocently and without fraud-without any benefit to himself directly or indirectly-did not do the act, he should be protected; because the person beneficially entitled, though only in remainder, ought to look after the property, and by his vigilance protect an honest trustee. rLi-stees and executors were bound to sue for debts, and there were many very hard cases in which they had been made responsible for debts which they had not sued for, because they believed the amounts could not be recovered. He proposed to protect trustees and executors against tbaresponsibility if the Court did not see reasonable ground for believing that the whole or a subsantial part of the amount might have been recovered. There were cases, also, of executors being made responsible for not caling in money on bond which the testator had lent and had not directed by. his will to be called in. If the testator meant it should be; called in he should say so; aud in those cases he proposed to relieve the trustee from responsibility, unless a change of circumstances within his knowledge rendered it imperative that he should caU it in. If an executor filed a bili in the Court of Chancery for administration, a day was named. before wbich creditors must come in or be excluded from the benefit of the decree. The creditors who did; come in and the legatees were paid, and the residue was divided, and the executor. was prote^ted against the claim of ang creditor who failed to show his claim in time. But if, to save the expense of a Chancery suit, an executor took precisely the same course without the authority of the Court, he was still liable, afrer honestly distributing the funds, to be sued by creditors who took no notice of his advertisement to come in by a certain day and prove their debts. He proposed, where an execuitor took the same seps to ascertain the creditors which the Court itself would take if a Bill were filed, to: protect him against the claim of any creditor who had not come in. It would not have the effect of barring the claim of such creditors; but, instead of going against the executor, they would have to go against the persons who had received the residue. It constantly happened that execators of leasehold estates were obliged to seek the protection of the Court of Chancery against liability upon rents and covenants, and the Court was in the habit of ordering a sufflicient portion of personal estate to be put by in order to answer future demands. Anything more unreasonable could not be imagined, and as it prevented the distribution of estates he proposed that where all rents had been paid and covenants performed, and where any precise sum to be laid out at a future time had been provided for, the trustee should not, after signing and sealing, be held responsible. He also proposed to give trustees a summary nght by petition, without rendering it necessary to file bills, to obtain a decree of the Court of Chancery upon any point, which might arise in the administration of the trust estate. This would boa great benefit to trustees, and, by substitating a cheap and simple process of determining questions, prevent the necessity of expensive suits. In conclusion, 'he noble lord invited assistance in considering the points raised by the Bill, which he laid upon the table of the House. Lord BROUGHAM said, he was not prepared at once to enter upon so very important and in many respects so difficult a subject, but he would give his best attention to it. He rejoiced to believe that the present move ment in legislation was likely to result in removing what he had long regarded as one of the greatest blots on our law -that was to say, that peculiarity of the law of Englandor it was unknown to the law of Scotland-by which a breach of trast, instead of being an aggravation of the offence of the person who appropriates the trust property of others to his own use, was actually made a complete de-, fence, and converted the wrongful act of the trustee into a mere civil debt. He remembered a remarkable instanceand he was sorry to say it was by no means a solitary oneof that defect of the law which was brought under public notice. A gentleman-he grieved to say a member of the same profession as himself, and he grieved also to say a gentleman of very high repute in that profession-having been the guardian of two infants-young women-embezzled-he (Lord Brougham) could call it nothing else, though the law of England did not call it that-bat he would say, using the language of the law, appropriated the moneys of thosewards of whom he was the guardian to his own use, though, using the language of common sense, and that in which human feelings would naturally find vent, it would certainly be more true to say that he robbed them - and, having done that, he died insolvent, leaving those unfortunate young women on the parish (hear, hear), and, being an insolvent, he was dispunishable. (EHear, hear). He was only regarded in equity as an equitable debtor, instead of being, as he was in the eye of common sense, a felon. (Helar, hear.) That was not the only instance of that kind which had come under his (Lord Brougham's) notice. He hap. pened on one occasion to mention the case he had just been relating to the House to a learned friend of his who had been Attorney-General for the sister kin dom, and who thereupon stated the case of a man in a stil higher degree of professional rank whose reputation was stained by the same felonious conduct. A jadge ia the sister kingdom performed the same act of robbery, as he (Lord Brougham) called it, and his infant wards were sacrificed. (Hear, hear.) He was decidedly of opinion with his noble and learned riend (Lord St. Leonard's) that it was not desirable to legislate for particular cases. The tendency of that was possibly to iterfere where we ought not, and it also had iS ad tendency, that we wereapt to take a one-sided viow and regard the question only in that light, and therefore our legislation was likely to be imperfect. Efle thouvht ti prudent course to tak iin deaing with this subject was, not to go too far and attempt to throw their net overall breaches of trust, but to satisfy themselves in the firsb instance by extending what was commonly called the Bankers Actto al persons under similar circumstauces, such as attorneys, stewards, and paid agents-all persons, in facb, who might be said to stand in relation of trustee to parties beneficially interested in trust funds, and to make their malversation an offence punishable as a misdemeanour. By that he meant not merely their misappropriationi of trust funds, but their appropriation of them for their own use and behoof, so that they should be practically and substantially gainers by the offence. He would also apply that rule to all directors of companies committing a breach of trust either for their own benefit or the benefit of those with whom they were associated in such companies, and that they should be liable for such a breach of trust as for a criminal offence. He believed some sort of procedure such as he had indicated was highly expedient. It would certainly tend to make our law more conformable not only to the laws of other countries, but also to reason and justice. (Hear, hear.) He mlght say he had not taken up this subject on the spur of the moment. His mind had been attracted to its consideration long before those unhappy bank failures which bad roused-and deservedlyronsed-the popular indignationand it had also been under the notice of the Law Amendment Soiety, of which he was a member. The law of other countnes-that of Scotland, certainly-prooeeded upon sounder principles, for it regarded breach of trust as an aggravation, and not a defence. In Scotland the indictment proceeded in a regular syllogistic form. The major proposition was that ie all countries theft was a punishable offence, and the minor proposition that a fraudulent breach of trust was a theft' therefore (here his lordship turned suddenly round in jest to Lord Campbel, who was sitting near him) you, John Campbell, having oommitted a fraudulent breach of trust, are liable to be punished. (Laughter.) That grievous anomaly between the lavv of Scotland and that of E:ngland was happily doomed in one way or another, and tere was nowv no chance of its long surviving. In his opinion1 any measure which lieng to prevent re- spectable persons from undertaking the office of trusteO would be fraught with very great mischief. He was inclin. d to think that the best course would be to devise some mesns forthe paymerit of trustees. Lord CAMPBELL thought their lordships were greatly inaebted to his noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's), whohadbroughtthissubjectundertheirconsideration. Inhis (Lord Campbell's) opinion this measure was a proper accompaniment of the penal Bil which had been introduced in the other House. It was most desirable thattrustees who acted honestly should be protected, while those who were guilty of fraud should be subjected to severe punishment. Not being familiar with the proceedings in courts of equity, he bad been quite horrified to learn in what manner trustees were dealt with in those courts. He could assure their lordships that no such iniquities were perpetrated in the courts of common law. (A laugh.) The status of trustees woald undoubtedly be much improved by this Bill; but he thought that, in its present form, the measure would operate with great injustice in the case of the cestui que trusts of persons beneficially interested. If, for instance. a trustee were empowered to pay a widow a certain annuity, and e aid her half as much more as she was entitled to receive, which she expended, he would have no remedy under the existing law, but the noble and learned lord proposed to enable the trustee to recover the overpayment or to deduct it from the annuity. He (Lord Campbell) thought, however that it was the duty of persons who undertook the responsile office of trustees to ascertain carefully what payments they were called upon and empowered to make. He trusted his noble and learned friend would reconsider this subject, and would in such cases allow the loss to fall upon the negligent trustees. The LORD CEA?&CELLOR observed, that it was exceedingly difficult to understand a measure of this description, even if it were placed in their hands to read, but it was impossible that any one could have followed his noble and learned friend through all the details into which he had entered. He (the Lord Chancellor) must say that he thought his noble and learned friend was attempting to attain an object which was impracticable. The noble and learned lord's object, as he understood it,was to protect innocent trustees against punishment for breaches of trust. If the rules which regulated the conduct of trustees operated harshly they should be altered by the Legislature; but they could not leave the law as it now stood, and say it was the duty of trustees te follow a certain coursa while they gave legislative protection to trustees who did not pursue that course. The Legislature ought to define the duties of trustees, who, if they discharged those duties, would, of course, be exempt from all responsibility. If, however, they did not perform their duties he did not see why they should be relieved from responsibility. He was far from saying that the rules by which the conduct of trustees was regulated might not in some instances be too harsh, but if that were the case those rules ought to be relaxed. He did not see how they could leave the rules as they were, and yet absolve trustees from the consequences of their negligence. He hoped, however, that their lordships would read the Bill a nrst time; and the most convenient course would be to postpone its further progress until the measure relating to the same subject now pending in the other House came before their lordships, when the provisions of the two Bills could he considered together. It had been suggested by one of his noble and learnedfriends that it was not politic to legislate upon this subject while the public mind was so much excited on the question, but he could assure his noble friend that the Bill which had been introduced into the other EHouse was not the mere consequence of the events of the last year. That measure, although not actually matured, was put in train last year, but recent events had shown the urgent necessity of legislation on the subject! and, although there were numerous difficulties coenected both with the measure of his noble and learned friend and that now before the other House, he thought Parliament ought not to shrink from grappling with those difficulties. Lord LIFFORD suggested that some means should be adopted for obviating the necessity to which trustees were constantly reduced of resorting to the Court of Chancery. and subjecting trust property to what ho must call the legal robbery of that court. [Intimations of dissent from several noble lords.] The expression was certainly a strong one, but he thought very few of their lordsbips could be acquainted with the iniquities of the Court of Chancery. (A laugh.) Indeed, they might as well expect the Emperor of Russia to be acquainted with the iniquities perpetrated by Custom-house offncers in the remotest corners of bis dominions as to expect that the Lord Chancellor should be cognizant of, or should be able to prevent, the robberies of the Court of Chancery. (Laughter.) The noble lord complained that the delays in proceedings before the judges' clerks were quite as great as those formerly experienced in the Masters' offices, and concluded by asking the noble and learned lord on the woolsack whether it was intended to expedite the business in the judges' chambers by giving additional clerks to the Vice-Chancellors and the Master of the Rolls ? The LORD CHANCELLOR must protest against some of the language which the nob'e lord had applied to the Court of Chancery. He often heard complaints of matters which, when he investigated them, he found were attributable entirely to the negligence of the complaining persons, who had not chosen to stir in the business, and had therefore given the Court no opportunity of assisting them. As to the subject of the noble lord's question, he had already communicated with the judges and obtained returns from their clerks, and although it was Dreposterous to say that the delays were as great now as they were in the Masters' offices-such delays as these were now being matters of days when formerly they were matters of months-he was not prepared to say that the increase of business might not render necessary an increase of the number of clerks. In the Accountant-General's office an additional clerk had already been appointed in each department, and the principal functionaries of that office had assured him that, with this addition to its staff, they should be able satisfactorily to dispose of all business whieh iight come into it After a few words from Lord BROUtHA tr7 *Their lordshipa adjourned at 10 minutes after 7 o'clock.

THE INDIAN ARMY. Mr. RICH asked the President of tte Board of Control whether since the passing of the Act 16th and 17th of Viotoria, cap. 95, any measures had been taken for increasing the number of European officers in the sepoy regiments, for checking tte drain of officers to ci vU employ. ments, and for otherwise securing fte constant presenoa with tteir regiments of a greater number of officers than at the time of tte passing of that Act appeared to be the practice of tho Indian army ; also, whether any measures had been taken for raisingthe general condition of tte native officers, and for opening promotion to the rank of native officer at a shorter term than the 20 or 30 years of previous service by which it then appeared ordinarily to be obtained. Mr. V. SMITH said that since the passing ofthe Act to which the question of tte hon. gentleman referred one captain and one Ueutenant had been added to each sepoy regiment both of infantry and cavalry, and two captain*! and two lieutenants to each European regiment of infantry. "With respect to tte checking the drain of officers to civil employments, ho could only say that the Court of Director,, had .now under their consideration a despatch, whioh would be snfcmitted to tto notice of tho Board of Contro1, placing tte state of things inX,jegard to that point upon a better footing, by equalizing tho advan. tages to officers remaining in tho regiments witt those which a withdrawal from ttem presented. He might add that, in accordance witt a recent regulation, tte officers inthe Queen's regiments were competent to obtain staff employment, and that as a consequence the number of Company's officers required for ttat purpose would be diminished* He was not aware that any measures had been taken with the view of raising the general condition of native officers, nor did he know that any complaints had been made upoa the subject. Nothing had been done in reference to the question of opening promotion to the rank of native officor at a shorter period than the ordinary term of 20 or 30 years, and he might remind the hon. gentleman that the service in India was one in wliich tte system of promotion by seniority prevailed. In the Presidency of Bombay, it was true, promotions from the ranks to some extent took place on the gronnd of merit, and it might become a matterf or consideration how far it would be expedient to extend that system totte other presidencies. As tte question of tte hon. gentleman might have been founded upon the nnfortnuate occurrence* which had recenfly token place in India, it might ba desirable that he (Mr. V. Smith) should state that ttbse oc-' cunences, sofar as he was aware, were in no way to be attributed to the absence of the officeis from their regiments He should add the expression of a hope that tte puMio would be rmder no alarm upon that subject, as, owing to the promptitude and Trcgour which had been displayed by his noble fnend Lord Canning, and the exceUent demonstrations which had been made upon tto occasion of the disbandment of the 19th Regiment by General Hearsay, ^^v?3 £° doguent and stirring speech to which that gaUant ofitcer had then given l__r_ice? the Ute disaffection among tte troop! in __iH_d completely been put an end to, a. he felt qnite sure any sach occurrence would m future be put an end by the exhibition of the same promptitude and the same vigour as that to which he had just referred.

Mr. "WILSON then gave notice that it was his intention to move to-morrow mght tte Civil Service Estimates a_ soon as the Chairman of Ways and Means took tte chair in Committee of Supplv. He proposed then to make a general statement on the subject of tte Urge increase of tharges which had taken place within the last five or six years in connexion with those estimates, in order to afford the House ample opportunity for discussing a question in which it was evident the publici had of Ute taken much interest. He ttought it would be better to take tte course which he had mdicated than to leave the question tobe dealt with in a desultory discussion upon each vote as it arose. (Hear hear.) l ' *_.*«. ^.NI,.*T "^*edtoknow whether he understood thatthe Secretary of tho Treasury intended to brine on a general discussion of the CivU Service Estimates, bectuse a portion of the civil estimates were only deUvered ttat morning, and tte House would scarcely be ready to-morrow to go mto a general discussion of these estimates 1 Mr. WILSON said, thatlhis intention was, on going into Committee of Supply when tte Chairman of W"aj! and Means was in the chair, to make a general statement, not having reference to fte estimates of the present year, but tothe great increase which had taken pkcein these estimates from 18o2 to 18o6, including those of the present year. bix numbers of these estimates were now in tte hands of members, but tho seventh, which contained the accidental and occasional charges of the year, would not be ready for some time. .* Mr. DISRAELL-I shonld like to know whether the hon. member intends/when tte House is in Committee ot ?supply, to go into the civil estimates or not ? Mr. WILSON.-Yes, certainly. After any remarks which hon. members may make I shaU propose tte first vote in the Civil Service Estimates. »«i_ The CHANCELLOR of tte EXC____QUER.-"What my hon. fnend proposes is; in moving the first resolution m Committee of Snpply, to make a statement of the causes and nature of the increase that has taken place of late years, and in the total amount of the misceUaneous or civil service estimates, with a view, not of giving a general .new of all the particular votes, but of statingthe nature of the augmentations which have taken place of Ute years in the civU estimates. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY wished to ask the right hon. gentleman in the chair whether the Secretary to tte Treasury would be in order in taking a general discussion on a single vote? _ He had been himself called to order on a similar occasion, and told that he must confine himself to the particular subject under discussion in the vote before the House. The SPEAKER.-In answer to the qnestionof the hon. member, I conceive that if the Secretarv to the Treasury explains, for tte convenience of tte House and for the general infonnation of members, the foundation on which these votes are offered to tte House he will not be out of order in so doing. The CHANCELLOR of tte EXCHEQUER said that, as his noble fnend at the head of tte Government would not be in his place to-night, tte report on tte Committee of bupply would not be brought up ttat evening.

TO TEHE EDITOR OF TlER TTh1R bmr,-i was not in the lousewhen Mr. Ker Seymermade his speeob, or I should have stated the following facts in reply to his allegations. le said that the publicans are under the oontrol of the brewers. This may or may not be true in some place I will only speak for the farm to which I belong, believing, however, that all the London brewers act on the same system. We supply about 800 publicans in London and many tbousands in the country. As most of the latter are supplied secondhand, through agents, I cannot be sure, bht I believe the whole number to be not less than dx or seven thousand. Out of these slx or seven thousand only 120 occupy houses belonging to us; and of these 120 only 27 are tenants at wilL To the remainder we have given leases, and no stipulation whatever is made with them to force them to deal with us. Mtiany of them deal also with other brewers. All our remaining six or seven thousand customers are free from any Imaginable kind of inducement to deal with us, except the quality of our ale and porter. Many of them have received loans, but these loans can be pald off at any moment by any other brewer to whom the publican chooses to apply. I repeat-and I am quite ready to funmish ali the proofs to any one who likes to examine them-I repeat that the whole of our vast number of customers (with a most trifling number of exceptions) are free to leave us to-morrow if they please. What bas kept the trade in so few hands is not the licensing system, but the enormous taxation to which the trade is subject. We paid last year in taxes and excise no less than 170,0001. Every one -kows that heavy taxation gives a certain kind of monopoly to large capitalists. I am. Sir. v,,m ohAit r- CEHARLES BUXTON. iouse ox uommons. J Ule 1I. P.S.

THE CATHOLIC MEMBEMS AND THE OATHS Bui---The Belfast Northerm Whig, at aU times and seusons the able and zealous advocate of Liberalism in the broadest sense, has some severe remarks upon the meeting of Roman Catholic peers and members of Parliament recently held in London, and upon the recommendations of certain Irish journalsthat opposition should be given to the Jew Bill, unless the Roman Catholic grievances br redressed. "We hope, for theirownsake,"says the Whi, "the Romau Catholic members 'will be guilty of no such treachery to the great principle of civil and religious liberty. They would cover themselveswith deserved infamy by pursuing such a course. They who were only, as it were, but the other day freed from the shackles which bigotry and intolerance bad imposeduponthem,andwhospent acenturyclamouring for the sacred rights of conscience, to appear now as the abettors of religious disabilities, and the foes of freedom ! We cannot believe that they would be guilty of uch flagrant inconsistency, such scandalous selhishness, such tinmeasured turpitude. Because they may have grounds for complaint, are they therefore to refuse their consent to any rele for their fellow-subjects whose case is ten times worse than their own ? Roman Catholics are told by one of their would-be leaders that ' in acting on this policy they woulU have the assurance that they were not obstructing any great measure of justice, this Jew Bil beine merely a pet question, which private friendship has led one or two statesmen to identify themselves with, and it not being pretended, if Baron Rothschild wre kept out of Patliament for ever, that the public delibpration3 would suffer very much thereby. This is pretty language to come from the mouth of a frothy spouter about Roman Catholic wrongs, yelling for their redress. 'Not obstructing any great measure of justice' by opposing the Oaths Bil I Is not the right of the Jew to a seat in the Legislature just as good as the right of the Roman Catholic or the Protestant ? If it is unjest to exclude the Roman Catholio from Parliament, is it not equally unjust to exclude the Jew? Is not the principle the same in both cases? And has not the Jew Bil allalong been advocated simply as ' a great measure of justioe ? The argumert, that because Baron Rothschild might not poEens commanding senatorial ability, it is therefore perfectly legitimate for the Roman Catholic members to oombine to oppress and wrong him, is worthy of a man who could be so falze and traitorous to the great principle to which he owes it that he enjoys a seat in Parliament."-Manchester Examiner.

LORDOR, FRIDAY. JUNEZ 1X 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Smoke Nuisance (Scotland) BiU was read a second time on the motion of Lord KaNNAmRD. Lord Sr. LxoNAnD'S then broaght forward his Breaches of Trust Bill, and entered at con5iderable length into the difference between that and the Fraudulent Breaches of Trust Bill proposed by the Government. Lord BROUGAMv was not prepared at once to enter on so important and difficult a subject, but would give it his best attention. Lord CAMPBELL thought their Lordships were greatly indebted to Lord Sr. IoxARs'S for calling their attention to this subject. The L9oRD CHNCELLwOR thought that the measure was in some parts impracticable, but hoped that the Bil would bo read a frst time. After some further discssaion the BiU was read, a first time. Some other business was tnen despatched. and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, Mr. NVTLSON ave notice that, in the Committee of Supply this day, on moving the first resolution, he should make a genersl statement s to fli niture of the increase in the 0itil Servico EAhslstg -during, the last four years, with a view of elplabmtg the ?Ssons of the augmentation. Mr. WISE called attentions to the acooOuM& of the Duchy of Lancaster, priensted to ParliareM. He insisted- that what Parliametli had done wsh vforence to the revenues of tbeKDnchy showed t?ttbef. were considered not as private, but as pubktproperty, and he proceeded to showthat these revt;nuae were eaten up by what he osuidered mismanageS ment, or by useless functionariw snder a oumbsoun Gothic estabihshment He read a list of itoe5of expenditiro, tome of which provoked a little merik ment, and he observed that these charges upon t revenues wese unjust to the SOVlaGs as well as injurious to the State, and he wished to know whr it was that the net income of thee tuchy was stationary? HOe put various other qtestions to the CHANCELLOR of the Ducay, and 0oncluded br moving an address for a return of all manors and estates belonging to the CrOWN in nght of the Duchy ; of aU sale, grants, and enfranehisements since 1838 ; of the purchases and exchangs of land since the same period, and the date and term of all existing leases of the lands, mines, and rents of the Duchy. The motion was seconded by Mr. Aldermm Coz- LAND. Mr. 13Ans prefaced his reply to Mr. Wms by observing that there wereamany charges upolt the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, inclÃ¯Â¿Â½mding patent offices for life, besides outstanding lIease, which could not be got ria of at once; but since he bad been Chancellor, whenever an opportumity offered for making a beter arrangement he had availed himself of it. He called the attention, of the House to the position, in point of-law, of the two duchiesofLancasterandCor-nwall, which werediatiet fromtbeotherpossemsionsofthe CowN, and were n.ot given Up at the accession of the Sovereign with the other CROWN revenues, and he explained the extra. ordinary causes of expenditure, one of which was the scattered and dispered character of the property. But Mr. Wiss, he said, was in error whes be stated that the revenues were absorbed by the expenses. By an account of the actual payjnenta from this source into HER MAJESSTXs privy purse, it appeared that the average amount for the last 19' years had been 13,o(ool.; tbiat they had increased from 12,000L in 1851 to 20,0001. ia 1856, and there was a prospect of a considerable increase in the present year. HTeentered into furtber details in explanation of matters referred to by Mr. WISE anad. Mr. CoPLMNrD. Mr. J. L. Ricunno considered Mr. BA_sS answer as unsatisfactory. After a few remarks by Mr. BAss, the motion was agreed to. Mr. K-isD moved two resolutions, to the effect that there is reason to believe that the administration of the lower provinces of Bengal does not secure to the population the advantages of goo government, but that the mass of the people suffers grievous oppression from the police, and the want of proper administration of justice; andc that it is desirable that MPn IAJSrY's Government should take immediate steps with a view to the institution of special inquiries into the social condition of the people, and to ascertain what measures have been adopted in consequence of the oppression under which a large proportion of the inhabitants of the Lower Provinces are now said to be suffering, more especially with reference to the system of landed tenures, the state of the police, and tha administration of justice. In support of the resolutions he dilated upon the alleged oppression, misery, suffering, and debasement of the ryots of Bengal, whose condition was, he said, deteriorating, owing to the nature of the tenures, the tyranny of the zemindar, the inefficiency, abuses, and corruption of the rural police, and the defects in the administration of crimina justice, respecting all which matters he read much documentary evidence. The motion was seconded by Mir. Deunlon, whoe cited additional documentr. The first resolution being put, Mr. V. Su=m said he did not wonder at the thinness of the House (of which Air. Dusmoi, had. complained) upon a motion for inquiring into a subject upon which inquiry had been carried to the utmost, and a motion, too, which was not of a practical nature. The speech of Mr. KINwAuRD was almost a continued chain of extracts from papers; and Mr. DuxLoP's was of a similar character, proving that inquiry was unnecessary for obtaining information. IHe denied that the East Indian Government was answerable for the mischiefs complained of. The chief allegations, he observed, were the deficiencies of the police and of the administration of justice, and the answers to these allegations were contained in papers already presented to the House, extracts of which he read. Questions connected with the land tenures of India were beset with difficulties. WVith respect to the police, inquiries were being instituted by the Government, and remedies for ascertained grievances were in operation, while the Legislative Council of India were passing bills for the improvement of the judicial administration. In dealing with matters involving any interference whatever with native prejudices, it was of infinite importance that the proceedings of the Government should be slow and cautious. HIe reminded the House of the spirit which had. manifested itself in some, he hoped a very few, of the sepoy regiments in India, which had beae easily put down; but there was a prevalent notion among them that the Government were intent upon compulsory conversion. He pointed oat a passuge, in the petition of the missionaries in Bengal upon which Mr. KTn.NA had founded his resolutiona (and whom he had termed " the mouthpiece of the ryots"), characterizing in terms calculated to give, them much offence the religious notions of the natives of India. Sir E. PEBBY supported the first resolution. The question, he observed, was whether the statements of the missionaries were true. As regarded the social condition of the peasantry of Bengal, no E3glishmen could have equal opportunities for obtaining irnformation with the missionaries. Bat the facts did not depend upon the statements of the missionaries, which were coufirred by the indigo-planters scattered over Bengal. He condemned in strong terms, the employment of young men and civilians from the revenue departatent, and withoat legal training, inthe Company's courts in India. There were very few points of contact between the Indian and Earopeauraces; but upon one field they could meet upon a footing of perfect equality-that of justice. Lord J. RussEL concurred with Mr. SMmrr as to the iuexpediency of further iuquiry in this matter, and could not agree to resolutions so broadly condemning the Government of India. lVhile he thought there were serious faults in that Government, he could not say that the proess of remedy would be forwarded by adopting the resolutions. At the same time, the evils were of the greatezt magnitude. According to MIr. HALLIDAY, the police of India was so defective and bad as to be an engine of oppression, and the courts of justice were insullicient. If this was true, the benefits of governmeni were to a great degree lost; and yet, inthe opinio. of MIr. HExIDAY, these evils admitted of remedy. The Government were, therefore, bound to take tUee stibiect into their consideration, aud he couald nt doubt thnat they would do so. On the wPhole. 1 e rejoiced that the subject hbd been broug,ht uzn:r the consideration of the House, though the andop. tion of the resolutions wold not, in his opiion, further the object in view. Mr. M%ANGLES regretted the course talken by the missionaries in this maUter; they ought no, in his opinion, to interfere with the concerns oi Government. He discussed the causes of the oDmparative backwardness of the peasantry in Bengil, insisting mnuch upon the feebe character of the Bengalees. It was the duty, however, andawould be the endea. vour, of the InaianGovernment, he said, to provide for the people the best system of justioe; but he deprecated the extension of the Quusws Couirts, of which he drew a fearful picture, citing 'ifr. MIACU. LAY'S alarMing desription of tho Supreme Court at Calcutta. After some brief remarks by Lord BusY and fr. A. M1ims, Mr. AxrTox, urging the many difficulties whie% surrotunded all subjects connected with the Goven&. meat of India, said he should move the prevk question; but Mr. AIRD desired, after what had faUl frora Mr. Sura nad Lord J. RuLL, to withdtaw hia motion. Mr. HADFmLD, however, objected, ima insi3test tupon a division. Mr. LIDTEL and Sir J. TMAxi-Y spoke up3n this point. MIr. PUoIB defended the conduct of the missionaries, He snoved the previous question, whichs
Among tho lntigations of buman existence ,must be set down the kind delay which always intervenes between the conclusion of a Treaty and the publication of its terms. Up to the meeting of the Plenipoteiitiaries all is passion and excitement. Indignatioln and vengeance, not to say ambition, -dictate the most preposterous demands and the most extravagant expectations. Then comes the pause, broken only by, whispers of successful or baffled negotiation ; and, after several hitches, it is announced to the world that a perseverance which the sense of justice alone could inspire has -won excellent terms and ample security. WVe rejoice, and once more love our neighbours. Then comes the vague intermediate state we have mentioned. ilnor questions have to be settled, clauses worded, conlmissions appointed, schedules drawn up, and ratifications exchanged. When the Courts are happily distant enough, QuzE;E's messengers,Tartars, or Arabs, are kept galloping or "expressing" across the world; and at the cost of a hundred horses, and not a few men, two months may be made to elapse before the long expected document sees the vulgar light of day. Happily, the public by that tinie have ceased to expect it or to cara about it, or even to be aware that it is due. They %,only know that we have fought hard, that we have shown " pluck," that the foe is sensible of it, and that he is not likely to molest us for some time to come. Why need people know more 1 Happy, indeed, if they never know more, or had never more to know ! Of .the Treaties of 1814 and 1815, what survives that should survive, except the sentiments naturally inspired by a long and bloody struggle-the mutual respect of nations, and a deep desire of peace ? After two months' delay, we yesterday published the text of our Treaty with Persia. We should be sorry to hazard a conjecture as to the numuber of our readers who have thouight it worth their while to scrutinize this document in the simple interest of their country. Why, then, has it passed unread, or been perused with a listlessness that failed to catch the points ? Merely because people look elsewhere for the results of the war. WVe have struck a blow at Persia; we have invaded her territory; we have evidently frightened her out of her wits, and let her know what we can do, and what we are certain to do, if necessary. The expedition has done its own work-written its own peace; and happily some of its text is much more recent than that of the Treaty before us, besides being written in a stronger hand and somewhat brighter colours. Sir JAMES OUTRAMI has been the real negotiator, and no one can mistake or forget what he means. We are not apologizing for a lame convention. We have no fault vhatever to find with this Treaty. It costs, indeed, an effort of reason, not to say imagination, to feel it worth the expenditure of a million or two of money, and the death of some thousand men on both sides, in one way or another. The terms are so reasonable, so just, so moderate, so much what most Englishmen took for granted was the state of things before the rupture, that their faith will be rather taxed to believe the thing could not be done more quietly. Persia is to retire from Herat; to leave it and Aflfhanistan alone for the future. In case of any quarrel wvith them she is to request the friendly offices of the British Government, which is to do its best. Persia is only to attack Herat for the defence of her frontier, and to push her arms no further than necessary for repelling aggression. Our Consular establishments are to be on the same footing as those of the " most favoured," or, to call things by their right name, the " most feared" nation. The pecuniary claims of British subjects, or of Persians under British protection, are to be settled by a MIixed Commission. England gives up the protection of Persian subjects, unless in the employ of British Representatives and agents, and provided also that no larger privilege of protection is allowed by Persia to any other Power. The dignity of the British CitowN is to be vindicated in the person of Mr. CHARLES MURRAY, who is to receive in State a letter of apology for some offensive remarks of the SHAH, and to be solemnly invited to the capital. He is to be conducted thither in State, to receive a visit from the PRI3IE 3IINISTER, to be accompanied by the SECRE-TARY of STArE for FOREICN AFFAIRS to the Palace, and presented by him to the SHIAHI. He is to receive another visit the day after from the PrEnIEr, at noon; which visit Mr. MURIAY is to return the next day, at the latest before noon. No private names or domestic circumstances appear in the Treaty. There is not a word .about the proposed electric telegraph, or the Euphrates Valley line, or any port or emporium in the Gulf, or about the Russian acquisitions of territory on the Caspian. Russia only appears -under the euphemism of " the most favoured " nation," and, in place of the bold but fruitless diplomacy wlhich 50 years ago -was pledging England and Persia to resist that Power by force of arms in defence of one another, we now suppose an universal peace, only stipulating for the same position in all respects, whatever that position mnay be, as Persia's northern neighbour. No doubt, some political fire-eatcrs will think this a la ne, impotent conclusion. Wee have already described it as a disappoiintment on1 the popular cstimate. But what did people think of Persia, andl what did they expect us to get by the war ? No doubt, the expedition of ALEXANDER the GREWT was attended with more tangible and remarkable r.sults. But his object was conqluest, and ours was to keep Persia and its neighbours in a state of independence and mutual respect. Our object is founlded on the 5status quo, and the abandonment of mere traditionary claims and visionary ,prospects. It is, then, the greatest praise of a Treaty which professes to carry out this object that -it Eeems at fir-st sight to do nothing, to create iothing, to give nothing, and to take away nothing. Any snch positive feature would have contradicted the tenour of the Treaty and the purity of our intentions. In fact, there are few intermediate terms, no fixed ones, between independence and ruin. We could not have gained any-thing from Persia but to her irreparable loss :and disgrace. This is the very thing most 'opposed to our own interests in the East. It is our interest that all the various races between us and Russia shoiild remain as they are, only growing stronger, more peaceable, more settled, and more consolidated in natural combinations. We would rather see " the absolute King of Kings "' of all the States of Persia" better respected by his own subjects, in order that he may be able to say "Way" to the rising demands of the Power with which he shares the Caspian. We should even have been content to let him enjoy a barren -title to the ancient sovereignty of Herat. But -the weakness of Persia, which compels it to recede -on the north-west, makes it listen to schemes of aggrcssion on its eastern frontier. It is puished against us by a stronger hand. Wo do it, then, as snuch kindness as ourselves when we ascertain its position, decide its frontiers, and disabuse it of pretensions which may make it a prey to foreign intrigue. This is the work of the Treaty before us. It is not a very showy work. It does not read like the life of ALaXAND3, or even of PHiLIP. We are neither conqueriog Persia nor plotting for a supremacy over it. We are only teaching it to let others alone, and be itself independent of others.
The days of Blac'k Books, seditious speeches, and criminal informations are gone by, and it is somewhat diffcult to realize the state of things wvhich existed in the times when orators declaimed againsi the bloated Pension List, and even moderate men grieved over the inextricable tangle of abuses in which all our institutions -were involved. But we may gain some notion of this bygone age by a glance at the description of the Duchy of Lancaster as given by Mr. WISE last night. Having done so, we may well be gratefiil that all our national institutions are not Ducbies of Lancaster. As most of our readers are aware, the revenues of this Duchy are still enjoyed by the Sovereign, and, though the other property of the Crown is at the beginniing of a reign made over to the nation in return for a fixed yearly payment, these estates, together with those of the Duchy of Cornwall, till remain in the possession of the Sovereign or the Sovereign's eldest son. Nowr, though such ani arrangement is open to objection, it might fairly be argued that such a property as that of the Lancashire Duchy might be conveniently excepted from the rule which gives the State the control of the CrowYn property ; and it might even be naturally thought that private superintendence would produce a greater revenue than ofiicial administration. But the traditional character of the Duchy forbids, it would seem, a simple management of the estates. All that the country desires is, of course, that this property should pay yearly as large a sum as possible to the Privy Purse. But the heralds anid the lawyers have very different ideas. With them Lancashire is a County Palatine, and the Duchy is a great territorial dignity, requiring many and well-paid officers for the due maintenance of its prerogatives. The consequence is that the revenues are wasted in keeping up an empty State. In the first place, there is a Chancellor of the Duchy, who is a Cabinet Minister, with 2,0001. a-year, and a ViceChancellor with 6001. a-year, who holds a court for a few days annually. There is a ReceiverGeneral with 8781. yearly salary; an auditor with 2001. ; a clerk, secretary, and registrar with 1,3101. between them; a solicitor with 3001., and a surveyor with 5001. There are also (we quote from the speech of Mr. WisE) two AttorneysGeneral, one for the County Palatine and one for the Duchy of Lancaster ; also 15 receivers and 23 stewards. Other charges on the estate are as follows:-Donations, 1,6031.; law, 3351.; surveys, 5401.; annuities, 9031.; and "sundries," 1,8731. It is evident that none but the vastest property can stand such profuseness in administration. We are not, therefore, surprised to hear that the average income for a term of years has been about 38,0001. per annum, of wbich the Privy Purse has received only about 13,0001. A yearly income of 13,0001. obtained by a staff of officials whose salaries amount to 8,2571. certainly presents a strong case for the Administrative Reformer. For many years the management of the estates seems to have been on a par with the effectiveness of this organization. We are told that on an average of 14 years the timber in Needwood Forest has been sold for 11,8931., the expense of cutting being reckoned at 9,9591. The produce of the Pickering Forest, in Yorkshire, was 7,5111., the cost for thelabour being 4,8141. Game iskept up for the amusement or profit of the neighbouring gentry, good land is recklessly exchanged for bad, and the property is, on the whole, worse managed than any in its neighbourhood. Such are tha accusations of Mr. WIsE, and they are corroborated by the fact that no one contradicts them, an& by what is generally known-that the income of the Crown is far less than it should be from possessions of such extent and value. Mr. BAINES was able to say little about the past, but made promises for the future, which wve trust lie will have time and strength to perform. He told the House, what we may well believe, that improvement must be very gradual, on accoiunt of the abuses which have accumulated during so many years. " There were," he said, "many outstanding leases granted long before he "had anything to do with the Duchy, a variety of "stipends and charges on land, numerous arrange- nments of one kind or another, grants of patent "offices for life, and so on." Here we have in miniature all that the kingdom at large has thrown off during the last thirty years. MIr. BAncEs takes credit for his desire to increase the net revenue by abolishing sinecures or unnecessary offices. He tells us that as it is the sum paid into the Privy Purse has risen to 20,0001. annually, and may be expected to increase. A saving of 1,2001. a-year had been effected in the Receiver-General's Department, a saving of 4001. a-year by cutting down the Chancellor's own salary to2,0001. Hence he thinks that the matter may be safely left in the hands of the Government. But, -with all deference to the opinion of 1VIr. BALNES, and with the filllest confidence in his ability and zeal, we may observe that the whole organization of this Duchy of Lancaster is a thing belonging to a past age. lW'e have abolished all local jurisdictions throughout the kingdom, except where there have been valid reasons for their continuance. Where is now the Chief-Justiceship of Chester, or of the Isle of Ely ? Wl'bat has become of the Welsh Judges ? They have been swept away as completely as the Kiingdom of Man, or the jurisdiction of the Highland chieftains. Why, then, should we keep up this anomalous, unmeaning, and most expensive ettablislnimet of the Lancashire Ducl2y? An able man like Mr. BAINES may well have a place in the Mlinistry with a more honourable office than the sinecure chancellorship of a phaltom principality. The Vice-Chancellor, who hears now and then a few cases at Liverpool and Preston, might as well leave the administration of justice to the County Courts. In fact, there is nothing real about the Duchy except its estates, and these are wasted ou unrealities which ought to have ceased to exist long ago. Let Parliament place the property of the Crown in the hands of a few sensible men of business, adding to the Royal revenue the 8,0001. a-year which is spent in useless salaries, and both the Sovereign and the nation will gain by the reform.
Tho Divorce Bill has been recommitted in the House of Lords and carried through this stage of the proceedings. It has now been broug,ht pretty nearly into the shape in which it wil be sent down to the Commons. Some of the more objectionable features of the Bill as it originally stood, and others which had been introduced in the course of the discussion, have been modified or removed. There remains, however, work enough to be done by the Lower House beforo this most important and interesting Bill is reduced to satisfactory proportions. We have often expressed a strong opinion to the effect that, with the exception of two or three outlying points of practice rather than of principle, no serious innovations ought, at least for the present, to be introduced into axF new Bill upon so critical and delicate a s;ubject as the lawa which regulate marriage. Tutu t2L9 ri man's remedy ba made common to all British subjects;-for the present that is nearly all we require. We want rather a change in the tribunal which is to decide upon matrimonial causes than a change in the laws which that tribunal is to administer. So far as this we may proceed with safety. Beyond this point interminable discussions, involving questions of the most sacred character, are let in. We do not, on the one hand,wish to see Scripture wrested beyond its natural sense; nor, on the other, to come into collision with the municipal law and common sense of the country. Let the consideration of all such points be postponed until we see our way a little more clearly into the consequences of our decisions. Let it be remembered that from time immemorial there have been in England but two great examinations, made into the laws affecting marriage. Immediately after the Reformation there was one, and this is the second. England has not reasoned out her present Law of Divorce,-she has drifted into it. The conclusions of the Reformers were not adopted, a-nd, as a natural consequence, relief beyond the law-Parliamentary reliefhas now for upwvards of two centuries been demanded and obtained by al who were opulent enough to purcbase so costly a remedy. With - regard, then, to the doctrines of the Law of Divorce a Tincaio matrimonii we would leave matters as they stand, save in so far that the remedy heretofore practically denied to any but the rich shouild be brought within the reach of the poorest subject of the CROWN. We would alarm no timid conscience, we would startle no strong conviction. We would leave things as they were so far as the point of absolute Divorce is concerned. We would, in fact, rather regard the practice of England than what may be strictly right, for to argue the question of right is to open the door to adverse opinions, and probably to allow of premature legislatioiu. With respect to matters of less vital interest, we are prepared for any change which may by clear arguments be proved to be politic and salutary. We have no objection to see prudent legislation and reform upon the subject of Divorces a mensdt et thoro-or, as we are to entitle them for the future, of " judicial separations;" for greater protection should be given to women than heretofore to hold them safe from the brutality and cupidity of bad husbands. The partial and disgraceful action of crim. con., as it is called, should be swept out of the Statute-book altogether. Upon all points of this kind we are disposed to welcome any reasonable and temperate measures of reform. Against the constitution of the new triblunal we have not a word to say. That first point is carried. 'We may also congratulate our fellowsubjects that the action for damages above referred to has in the old form been abolished. As we understand the LoRD CHANCEL1oR's proposition, which was adopted the other night by the Peers, any peison who wishes to " Divorce" his wife (and henceforward, we repeat it, " Divorce" means " absolute Divorce") must proceed against the wife as well as the paramour. Both must be made defendants in tne case, so that at least the wife may defend herself, which she is not admitted to do under the present state of the law. In the next place, a fine may be inflicted by the Court upon the paramour to any amount not exceeding 10,0001. Of the first part of this proposition we entirely approve. Can anything be mnore monstrous than a state of the law which admits of such an occurrence as one which we reported in our impression of yesterday ? Sir J. DoDSOw delivered judgment in a suit for Divorce which had been brought in the Arches! Court. The suit was at the instance of a Mr. EvY&.s, of Cheltenham, who had previously-in August, 1854-obtained a commonlaw verdict against his wife's supposed paramour, with 5001. damages. Mrs. EvAxs was thus branded as an adulteress in the face of the world; she had not been allowed to say a word in defence of her own character. Now, here is Sir JoRN DODSON'S opinion of the evidence upon which that verdict had been obtained - The "witnesses by whom it was attempted to maintain "the charges were persons whose evidence the "Court must necessarily receive with suspicion, "and when they were, as in this caue, directly "contradicted as to most material circumstances "by unimpeachable witnesses, the Court could not "possibly pronounce the lady guilty of adultery "upon their evidence." We rejoice to have done with that state of things ; it is also satisfactory to know that the injured husband is no longer, even in theory, to be supposed to ask and receive compensation for his wife's dishonour. As Lo the penal consequences, we have the gravest doubts if they ought to be introduced into the present Bil. The change is a very violent one. We doubt if it will be found in harmony with the existing usages and feelings of the country, and if it will not open the door to extortions of the grossest kind. At a subsequent stage of the proceedings the Bishop of OXFORD procured an amendment to be pawsed, to the effect that the Coturt might at its discretion award fine or imprisonment upon both the adulterous parties. This will never do. Lord CAaPnELL truly said that any man of decent feeling would " feel reluctance, and even " horror," at taking a course which might consign to a prison his wife, no matter what her guilt might have been. The LonD Cn:AcmLnoa took the same rational view of the case :-" Nothing " could be more revolting to the mind of a man whose wife had been infaithful t3 * him than the reflection that he could "not obtain a Divorce without subjecting her to "imprisonment." If imprisonment be constantly inflicted by the Court it wiU stop applications for Divorces even in the most necessary cases ;-if this be not so, -why leave the threat of it standing as a clause of this Bill We have great hesitation even as to the propriety of the fine, beyond the entire cost of the proceedings from first to last, which should be invariably awarded against the paramour. A fine would be used as an instrument of extortion. If small, it will be disregarded ; if large, and to such an amount as 'Will seriously cripple the paramour's fortunes, it should be remembered that the best thing society can wish is that the adul- teress and her paramiour shoxld become man and wife, and there is no particular object to be answered by reducing them to poverty. The relief the husband seeks in such a case-and which the wife has equally a right to seek-is the dissolution of the marriage bond. We have no doubt this part of the Bill will receive the most serious consideration in the Lower House. The CHANcEmxn has happily succeeded in ex-. punging the amendment former]y' carried by the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, to the effect that the guilty parties were not to be allowed to marry again while the husband or wife who had obtained the Divorce continued to live. This most irrational aud mischievous clause was strucl; out on Tuesday night. Adultery would indeed have been at a premium when the adulterer was absolutely forbidden to marry the woman by the language of the statute. Thus the great security against adultery-a security far greater than either fine or imprisonment-was taken away. These are the two principal points to which we wished to direct attention. The changes which have been made in the law as far as regards " judicial separation," ani the protection of- women against the brutality, the desertion, aud the cupidity of bad husbands, aeem Q the most part to be judicious enough, and well calculated to promote the ends in view. These, however, involve none of those great questions of principle which affect the religious convictions and deeper feelings of the country. The chief point for the decision of the Commons in the amended measure will be the policy of inflicting fine or imprisonment, or both, in addition to the relief afforded by the absolute dissolution of the marriage.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI3fES. Sir,-Among other good omens for the success of the scheme for stimulating middle-class education by means of University certificates, I rejoice to see that it has the advanage of gour powerful advocacy. But mnreading yonr article of Wednesday I could not but ragret that it was calculated to leave an impression on hasty readers that one Univessity only was coaning forwvard ia the mnstter. Both Universities are advancing pai'i passu in giving effect to the plan. In reply to sundry deputations and mnemorials from Birmingbam. Liverpool, Leeds, Cheltenbamn, and other places, the Council of the Cambridge Senate stated that the proposalwas under their serioua consideration. On the 3d inst. the Council pre3ented their report to the Senate, ard a graoe was pased approviung the principle, and appointing a spidicate to preparo the details of the mesure. Some of t e moet inflnential names in she University are upon thbi syadicate, and there is ever reason to believe that before the close of the year the UniVersity of Cambridge wiM be in a position te give effect to the schemec. At seems to mue important to have it generally underatood that Oxford xud tambridge, in devefloping this plan o mniddle aohoolexansui,tiona and certificates, are responding to ani appeal madt to,them f rom the country.

EER MAJTESTY's THEATRE. Last night the experiment was made of approximating the representation of Don Gimoanni more closely to the design of the composer and the meaning of the poet than in any representation that has been seen for many years. Three pieces hitherto omitted have been restored, new scenery has been painted, andin someinetances thebusine of the stage has been altered to exhibit more clearly the progress of the action. The musical reformation has been most creditably achieved under the superintendence of Signor Bonetti, acd the whole strength of the company is employed in the execution of the -work. Of the restored pieces tho most important is "DeL sua pace," the aria sung byDon Ottavio to express his sympathy with Donna Anua after she has recounted her wrongs and sung the celebrated "Or sai chi 1onore." Why this aria has generally been omitted it is hard to conjecture, for cer.. tainly Don Ottavio is not so much overburdened with songs that he need negleot an opportunity of appealing to the audience. Snag as this was by Signor Giuglii last night it was one of the most effective airs of the whole performance. He gave it in his most unaffected and impressive style, and thus raised it above the ever popular "f11 mio tesoro," in which he aJlowed himself certain liberties with Mozart. Another restored air is "H o capito" sang by masetto, when Giovanni first begins to pay attention toZerlina, and the bridegroom expresses his uneasiness. Awed by the condescension of the Grandee, and at the same time suspecting that aUl this civility is not weU meant, he contrives to show obeisance to his noble friend, while in an undertone he upbraids Zerlina. The moral position thus indicated is represented with considerable humour by Signor CorsL The remaining restoration is " Ah, fuggi ii traditor," sng by Donna Elvira immediately after the duet "La ci darem." By the ordinary arrangement Elvira's rescue of Zerlina from the clutches of Giovanni is scarcely intelligible, but by this air the warning against the libertine s distinctly conveyed. Nqet only is the scenery new through the whole of the first act, but ithas been painted in immediate reference to the business of the stage. The " introduction" does not take place in the street, after the old fashion, but in a garden attached to the commander's house, into which the libertine is supposed to haveintruded. When Giovanni invites iho wedding party to partake of his hospitality, his palace is the most conspicuous object in the decoration. The ball-room is fitted up with extraordinary splendour, a fountain of real water plaYing in the midst of of it, and briliaunt lamps being suspended from the ceiling. Moreover, by.an ingenious arrangement of thescene, the problemof executingthesaworddances simultaneously has been triumphantly solved. The imperfect management of this partlcular scene has long been lamented by the admirers of the opera, and therefore especial pains have been taken with it on the occasion of this revival. Several of the principal dancers are engaged in the festivities of the ball, though there is no doparture from the text of Mozart for the encouragement of chore. graphic displays; the chorus Is strengthened by the addition of several principal singers, in order to give due effect to " Viva la Liberta," and the groups ranged about the stage on different elevations preservo a constant appearance of life and activity. We have described tho distinctive features of this remarkable revival; but, as the opera did not terminate till midnight, we reserve til another occasion our remarks on the details of execution. The brief statement that the Zerlina of Mademoiselle Piccolomini was one of the most charming of her impersonations, and that Mademoiselle Spezia greatly distinguished herself as Donna Anna, will suffice for the present.

ROBERT HOLMES. An interesting memoir of the late Robert Holmex, one of the last great lights of the Irish bar, who recently died in London, appears in the Fteemanss Journil of this morning. The following abridgment may not be witholut interest. In the year 1848 Mr. Holmes virtnally closed his professional career, his defende of Mr. John Mitchel being, perhaps, the most powerful of his displays of forensic eloquence:- " With great rogret we heard of the death of this great lawyer in London, where hehad for somo years resided with his only danghter. Sioce his retirement from theIrish bar be never re-visited the scene of his former triumphs, though he felt a deep interest in all that concerned it, and made partioular inquiries about his old associates, of whoni few now survive. He was born, we believe,; in the neighbourhood of Belfast about 1762. so that he had reached the very advanced age of 95 years He entered college in the memorable year of 'Free Parliament-Free Trade,' and from tho recollections of '82 he derived mtch of tbat enduring ard intlexible patriotism which marked his whole life. His class-fellor and corapetitor was the late Chief Juntice Bnshe. The polished geniusofBushe delightedand excellediu classical literature, while theseverer pursait of mathematical science attached the more solid faculties oE Holmes. He was cadled to tho bar in 1795, when he had reached the mature ageof 32. Previously he had turned hia attention to physic. Itw ould be more interesting than useful to soeculate on 3is success as a cultivator of the 'mute arts.' He might have turned out an Irish Abernethy. He had the same rough manner, the samestrong andracyhumour, the same liberal love of raiUery, the same regard to truth,. and the same liking for a good fee. The adverse circumstances which beset his early career at the bar it is unnecessary to recaL He had to struggle against diffliculties which none living in these more fortunate times can adequately comprehend. His only inheritancewere the Mfts of niature, a strong intelligenoe, and manly love of labour. Be trained himself by careful study, and imbibed that clear and precise knowledge of principles which he always displayed with consammate effect and disciplined ease. With these elements of success he combined a pure, sober jadgmentandunmrvaUedcommon sense. With snchpreparation he was content to abide his time, for itsurely was tocome. There werethen *vigorous and promising race of aspirantsforrenown at theIrish bar-the two Pennefathers, Bushe, Barton, Goold, O'Connell, Wallace, Holmes, and several others. The old nobles of the robe were dropping off-BaU, Barston, O'Neill, Ponsonby, and Cnrran. A few were stiU in the prime of years and intellect-Plunkett, Saurin, Joy, O'Grady, Burrowes. Such were the eonsDicuous names at the lrish bar when Mr. Holmes appeared, and, perhaps, noun ever presented suot a consteDation of genius. Te Union had precipitated on the bar this splendid aggregate of which the Parliament hadnabsorbed a largo portion, and hence the difficulty of attaining distinction where the comrpetition was so great and the excellence so unexampled. . Some took a rapid lead, partly from their in fluence and partly from their talents, while others, such as O'Connell, Wallace, and Holmes, wereforcede into the rear, waiting for the order of time to move up the -reserves. Gradually Mr. Holmes moved to the front. His learning, his judgment5 his minute preparation, his convincing argument and impressive eIoquence at length firmly entrenched him in public approbation, and for 30 years placed him at the head of the common law bar of Ireland. His connexion with the Emmet family is well kinown and need not be repeated. To that connexion may be attributed the suspicion as weU as persecution to which he vas exposed in the early part of his career. We shall reproduce one or two. circumstances which are said to have moulded his characterandinclined it to Republicanism. He was a member of the lawyers! corps commanded by Mr. Sauri A general order was read on parade that the corps mu%t submit tothecode military and be divestedof its civiccharacter. Holmes, who had witnessed a flogging scene in the public streets, fearing the corps would be called onto 'witness similar actsof brutality, -throwdown -his arns -and stepped out of the ran"s. This revolt against authority roused tih indignation of the late Chief Baron Joy, who had a resolution passed in the north-east bar, that any person, not enrolled in the corps, was uvnworthy of being considered ' member of the bar. Holmes attended thenext bar dinner, where the resolution was read, Mr. Joy adding, that if any person present held the resolution applied to him he ought to leave the room. Holmes accepted the apolication, and psotested against the jurisdiction of the bar to take cognizanoe of political offences. He then left tbs room, and sent a message to Mr. Joy. The interval of a day was roquested to enable Mr. Joy to consult with his friends, and on its expiration, while Mr. Holmes was entertaining some friends at dinner, he was arrested and compelled to give baiL A criminal informatioa was next applied for. Caus5 wasshown by Carran and Plunkett. Rule absolute - but to save trouble Holmes pleaded guilty, and Lord &ilwarden sentenced him to six months' imprisonment. Half the sentence was remitted; but M3r. Holmes read law for three months in a Etlmainham dungeon. Another circumstance celoured the early life of Mr. Holmes. He had rcturned to Dablin from London the very morning of the Emmet outbreak. He was wholly ignorant ofthat foolish insmrection, but his house was forced open, his papers seized, and himself committed t prison on suspicion. Other dreadful consequences followed, which never passed from the mind of Dr. Holmes, and which there is no necessity to re-open now. There never was an advocate who relied less on the conceits of the profession. Strong in manly reasoning, he rarely had recourse to its counterpart-smartness and subtlety. What Swift was in literature he was in law. He bad a masterlr facility of exposition, which rendered his arguments perfect models. Everything was so chaste-so unembarrassed and free from pretension, the parts fitted so closely, the facts so luminously arranged, and the law so compact, welldigested, and closely applied, that you were at once satisfied of his surpassmng skill and superiority. Though not a case lawyer, or running too closely on the bold headlands of authority, therewere few who could pursue the law through. the winding stream of cases with greater sagacity and success. He generaUy contented himself with a few picked authorties, without weighing differences and resemblances too nioely or tracing anaogies and consequences beyond the surnmit level of common sense. At Nisi Prius 3Mr. Holme3 preserved mnuch of the loquent heat and briUiancy of the old bar, without its irregular and useless blaze. In his 80th year he was stil the most eloquent man in the profesaion. On great. occasions his address to juries combined the very highest qualities of oratory. His defence of the Jaotion and his 'C ase of 3Ireland,' a written speech rather tean a studied essay, and some passages in his masterly argument in the case of ' Watson v. Dil, ilUnstrate hia pecuhar style of eloquence. The fist has been considered his mLsterpiece. It had, at least, a wider influence aud. rendered hIs name more popnlar than aU his other speeches. Undeviating integrity was the foundation of that character v'bich invested hiii with the name of -the Irish Aristides. He refused a Crown Prosecutorship from Mr. Saurin in the beginning of his career when Government thought to gain hWm over, and 20 years later the Marquis of Anglesey pressed on him a silk gown, with a distinct intimation that the Solicitor-Generalship would follow. Bat he resolved to take no honour or office from any Government, and, if he would hJeld toainbition,hesaidthatnostatesman hadstrongerclaimsa on his respect than Earl Grey, by v'hom the tempting offer was made. He preferred that stuff gown, which was more honoured by bench and bar than all the silk- in Macclesfield. He loved nioney, and amassed it fast. It is said that he realized altogether at the bar the large sum of 100.O00L, the largest, we believe, ever acquired by a stuff gown, except Lord Clare's father, who3left him 4,0001, a-year in landed property, besidesa very considerablesui-n money. Of fear in nvy of its shapes Mr. Holmes knewnothing. In old times, v hen leaders were bullies-when the man vith one degree of courage tyrannized over him who had none at all, acd the former in his turn succumbed to another 'whose courage rose a little higher in the scale of resolution, Mr. Holmesneither inspired nor entertained fear. He intimidated none, and suafered none to intimidate him. When, 'Wallace ferociously said to a distinguished law-yer'who had the temerity to setthim right on a matterof fact, 'Sit down, Sir, or you know the consequence,' M1r. Holmes would have sat down, but the consequencewould have perilled the safety of the challenger. Wallace knew well the manner of maanhe bullied. That man was not Robert Holmes. iAke Curran, and Grattan,and O'Connelt, ho died on a foreign soil. He was one of the last-a fewcvwore, and the generation of greatness will have expired." THE FUNDS.

The King then asked whether, in case of a modification of the Con3titution by the Greek Parliament, such changes would be accepted by the Powers. The answer was, that the revision of the Greek Constitution was only legal Inasmuch as it was voted by a Constituent Assembly sumnioned ad hoc. The King observed that his brother, Prince Adalbert, who, as you are aware, is married to an Infanta of Spain, the cousin of Queen IsabeUa, and who is sti11 averse to abandoning his faith, would probably wait till his brother's (King Otho's) death fore fnally declaring himself. It appeared evident that the Bavarian Princes are not inclined to expose themselves to the decision of a Constituent Assembly. The protocol of 1832 secured the succession of the throne of Greece to the Bavarian Princes; the Constitution subsequently modified that protocol in what concerns therreligion of the successor, and the Constitution has been recognized not only by the three Powers, but also by the family whom it most concerns. The letter goes on to say that the refusal or hesitation of Prince Adalbert to conform to the religion of his future subjects produces a very bad effect in Greece, and justifies the suspicion that he speculates on the anarchy which would possibly ensue on the death of King Otho, in the too probable event of his leaving no direct successor, to force himnself on the Greek people. They complain mueh of the state of uncertainty in which the country is from want of a successor. They think that, even supposing Prince Adalbert wiling to adopt the orthodox faith, as next heir to the Crownn he should have long since taken up his residence in the country, in order to become acquainted with the manners and the wants of his future subjects, and to learn how to administer their affairs better than his brother has done. There are many wealthy Greeks residing in foreign countries who are deterred from returning to their country by the anarchy that they apprehend would foUow the death of a Sovereign whome throne would be vacant. As to the pretension of the Oldenburg Princes,who, anticipating the refusal of the Bavarian to change his religion, however ready they themselves may be to purchase a kingdom by apostacy, favoured the insertion of the disqualifying clause, a considerable part of the Greek people would resist any attempt to place them under the rule of one who, like the Queen of Greece, would be the devoted servant of the Imperial family of Russia. Despatches have been received here to-day from Stockbolm announcing that the health of the Kingo of Swveden continues to cause great uneasiness. It is said to be in contemplation to confer a provisional regency on the Duke of Scandinavia, Prince Royal, to relieve the King from the cares of government, until such time as there is a marked improvement in his health. M. A. Fould, Minister of State, has left Paris for England. He will only be absent a few days. Au Imperial decree confers on M. Abbatucci, Minister of ustice, the ad interim management of M. Fould's department during his absence. A great ceremoyv will take place at the Louvre on the 14th of Augiist next, the eve of the Emperor's f6te, to celebrate the completion of that magnificent palace, one of the glories of the present reign. The double distribution of the rewards to the artists who assisted at the building and decoration of the Louvre and of the prizes granted on the occasion of the Exposition of the Beaux Arts, which is about to open, will take place at that solemnity.

(FROM OUtR OWN 0ORPnSPOND".) VIENNA, JuEs 8. All the south and south-western districts of Be%sarabia are now in the hands of the Moldavian Government, the Russians having definitively quitted St. George's Island, Sulina, Ismail, Reni, Kilia, Tuslow, Kagcl, Arc. Although the Lower Danube has only been completely free since the summ6r of 1856, there is already a great improvemnent visible at its Sulina mouth. The Austrian and Turkish Governments have displayed great energy in clearing away the sand which forms the bar, and in blasting the roeks which rendered the pawage so dangerous. At the beginning of the year 1856 there were but seven feet of water on the bar, but there I now above ten. The means employed by the Austrinas and Turks to deepen the entrance of tb9 riVe Omre extremely simple. Large iron rakes QUd Jsivy chains are dragged to and fro by a .AerX tad the loosened sand is speedily removed JW4cd&ig- cbines According to 1L Wex, the Austrian engineer, who was employed to examine the Lower Danube, the St. George's arm was formerly exclusively used. In fact, it was the main river, and had a depth varying between 20 and i0 feet by a breadth varying between 1,080 and 1,800 feet, but about 60 years ago there wvas a violent Btorm, during which the river divided itself into threo arms. The southern (the St. George's) arm 'was found by the seamen to be so choked with sand that they were obligod to examine the nowly formed armls, and, as the Sulina proved to be the deeper of the two, it has ever since been navigated by vessels of large burden.

The last spark of life in Berlin expired this morning at 10 o'clock, wrhen the Kiing and Queen in all privacy passed through, or rather round, a portion of the town, and set off together to T6plitz. For the next four or five weeks the season in Berlin vill be a morte saivson to everybody, with the sole exception of the hotel-keeping public; and their trade, which they carry on very well here, seems to thrive and extenld with every recurrng summer. Their Majesties travel as (Count and Countess of Zollern. After a day's stay at Dresden they proceed to-morrow afternoon to Toplitz, where the Queen will remain four weeks. The K3ing, however, will leave there on the 12th inst. and proceed to Marienbad. The Prince of Prussia and Prince Friedrich Wilhelm arrived here on Saturday afternoon from Breslau, and after a hasty dinner the yOUng Prince found time, before going to the theatre, to inspect the progress of the works at the palace that is being altered for him and to try a team of six horses he has just bought, and which is now being trained for his future use. After joining in the family party and celebration of the sad anniversary of the following day at Charlottenburg, both the Prices left here the same evening for Minden, whence the young Prince will proceed to England. The police is understoo d to have obtained a clue to a wide-spread conspiracy among the working classes for the purpose of bringing about a general strike in all trades on the same day in Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland. The instigation to this plan is traced to Belgium, while similar plans, which have lately been detected in France, were traced to have been broached in England. The police of Berlin have accordingly made a communication to the municipal magistracy, and the latter have made it further known to the heads of the various trades' companies, with the additional injunction that the very first symptom of anything like a suspension of work by whole shops or any number of workmen shall at once be communicated direct to the police, who will then take the promptest steps. As yet no such symptom has exhibited itself. The most remarkable feature of life in Berlin at the present moment is the long protracted drought, which brings with it the more grievous effects, as the entire soil under and around Berlin is of sand, which, now that a drought of three weeks has reduced it to an extreme degree of aridity and fineness, rises from the earth at the slightest impact of any body, whether solid or aerial. In a normal Berlin summer of the warm kind-for we have also very cold summers sometimes-every three days of warmth are wound up by a thunder-storm and ample rain; but this aummer we have the warmth and not the palliative. The fruit is ripening prematurely into ruddy vegetable mummies for want of rain; potatoes and other field fruits cannot be banked up, because the dry earth has not cohesion enough to resist the slightest breath of wind; the woodworlk of our windows shrinks and lets in the dust through a multiplicity of crevices, and our doors are warping rapidly, and won't shut any more. The fire-enginesand thefeueqnehrar,ca-ledout every day to fires that break out in the woods and forests nearest Berlin, very slight friction between two neighbouring boughs sufficing just now to produce ignition ; and, In addition to these real alarms, there may be mentioned a number of falss alarms, occasioned by an aerial phenomenon called here hYhenrauch, which towards evening shows an appearance of columns of smoke rising from various high grounds. Though this phenomenon, which is seen only at periods of extreme drought, gives a certain contradiction to the wisdom of our ancestors embodied in the axiom that "where there is smoke there must be fire," it has not as yet contributed anything to the wisdom of the present generation, inasmuch as modern science has not as yet succeeded in finding an explanation for it. Yesterday evening two buildings used as firework-shops, in the neighbourhood of Berlin, blew up with a fearful explosion, shattering all the windows in the neighbourhood and destroying the lives of four or five persons. The following circumstances connected with this accident are peculiar.-It took place when no one was engaged in either of the workshops, which are separated from each other by a path of several feet wide; of the fireworkmaker, his assistant, the former's dog, and a woman who was near the spot at the time, who have perished, it is distinctly stated that none of their clothes were burnt nor their bodies injured, but that their heads split and the brains protruded; the fireworkmaker's 'wife, who was not far of at the time, was uninjured, as was also their dweling-house, behind which the two workshop stood. It appears that these list two incidents are due to the eircumstance that a large open plot of ground, used as an exercising ground for the military, closely adjoined, and admitted of the expanded air finding vent in that direction. When I mention, in addition to the above, that the goods station of the Leipsic-Dresden Railway was burnt down yesterday moming without our having, as yet, any explanation of the cause, your readers will be duly prepared for my soon announcing the arrival of the comet, which is expected by the population of these parts to destroy us all next Saturday, the 13tb inst. Some of the wise ones of this educated place notice thattheMan in the Moon has already flattened and scorched his nose considerably by coming in contact with that fiery mass while sw inging round our earth, which circumstance irrefragably proves that the comet must already be very near us. RUSSIA. A telegraphic despatch from Odessa says that the steamers in communication with Constantinople, tho Crmea, Nicholaieff, Cherson, and Rostoff had commenced running; and that those for Galatz and tho Sea of Azoff were to follow shortly. SPAIN. (FROM oun owN CORRUSPONDNT.) MADR1D, JuxE 6. The Senato did not sit yesterday, and the Congrss sat but for a short time. Senor Gonzalez de ia Vega roso, and said that he was desirous of rmoving that certain doouments relating to the Mir6a loaun, wich r voro on the tablo, should be referred to a eouniittee, but that, owing to tho extremely small mnmber of Progrosista doputies that had been returnod, ho hasd boon iunablo to find tho seven sigUitursw'uhioh wVeQ' required for a proposition to bE tl4uui into emitdoratim. Thoreupon, a nimber of dputioa juumped np and offered to sign, and anmong tboui wore thlsu lhther and brother-in-law of the AUWi0jr o t Finance, whom this motlon chiofly ad?et& It was thIo taken into considoration, and aIood to without a division. With irnoronc to the Royal order published on tle 4th lus., emixwning the slowness with which th xvorka oi the &Aadrtl and Irin lino of railway ar hmotucdA, tho Director of tho Cr6dit Mobilier has addrQsd a communication to tho DirectorGenei-l of Public Works, vindicatinu the activily of the enginer and employJs engaged in that undertaking, asking for comunirction of the text of the reports of the Govenment enginoers, and adding that he himself is about to viit and examine the works, and that, on his return, ho will givo an account of the results of his journey to the Minister and Director of the department. Barring further delays, of which there have been aleady not a few, the line of railway betweea Madrid and Almanza is to be opened to the publio on the 1st of July next. Madrid mourns and crape covers the Bullring, for Despordicios is dying. Despordicios is tho ieom de guere of Dominguez, a famous toreador, who was expected here shortly to gladden the oyes and hearts of the lovers of tauromachian sports. But fate and a fierce bull havo otherwise decided. On the 1st inst.,. in the Bull-ring of Puerto de Santa Maria, Desperdicios met with one of those grievous accidents which sometimes occur even to the most skilful of these modern gladiators. A bull, says the accoint which last night arrived and spread grief and consternation through Madrid, cauglht him on the right side with the left horn, then on the left with the right horn, tossed him, and as he fell caught him under the chin, splitting his jaw and driving the horn up to the right eye, which it forced out. The poor fellow displayed the pluck usual in members of his dangerous craft; he submitted with great fortitude to the necessary operations; but the loss of blood was so great that it was deemed impossible he could survive, and the last sacraments were administered. Nevertheless, on the following morning his state was somewhat better. 10,000 persons were spectators of the horrible sight. On the same day El Tato, another well-known bullfighter, was wounded in the leg. In the south, inhot weather, bull-fighting is particularly dangerous, owing to the furious excitement of the beasts. Some veryserious accidents occurred the other day, near Madrid, at a festival of Notuilos, or young bulls, held at a village called Getaf6. Onsuch occasions the spectators and amateurs are apt to get in the way of the bu}ls, and to commit most extraordinary imprudences. This was probably the case at Getafe, where one person was killed on the spot, and upwards of a dozen went into hospital; some of them, it is said, with smal hopes of life. Spaniards are offended if they are placed second in civilization to any other European nation, but they will hardly be allowed a place on the first rank until they cease to take delight in these savage and cruel sports. I From Arragon a curious story has reached us, which, if true, is rather umfavourable to the morality of the municipal authorities of that province. It is said that the Alealde (Mayor) of a village had a sum of public money in his house, and, having occasion to absent himself for a day, he enjoined the utmost vigilance upon his teniente or adjoint. in order that the money might not be stolen, He then departed, but happening to meet upon the road some Civil Guards or Gendarmes, he desired them to go to his house, and remain there until his return. About 1 in the morning three men forced their way into the house, and by their menaces compeRled the Alealde's wife to give up the money, but before they could take possession of it they were shot down by the Gendarme3. On removing the masks that covered their faces they were found to be the teniente-Alcalde himself, the secretary of the corporation, and a re9idor, or Alder. man. The Three per Cents. were done at 40 20; ditto Deferred, 26 10.
MrITARY EDIUCATION.--Sir Do Lacy Evans will move the following resolutions on Military Education in the Jouso of Commons on the 30th inst. :-' That, as the nnmerical strength of the British army available for Europe,n war is far less than that of any other great Power, and as our Government have for many yeas neglected the edacation of the commissioned ranks of the service, while other Governments have been devoting to this object large anmual sums and very treat attention, It is the opinion of this House that a higher standard of professional instruction than of late deemed requisite ought to be established for our officers generaly, but especially for those of the Staff. That this cannot be effectively accomplished in this country, where powerful influences obstruct ths best intentions of those invested with patronage, withoutt having recourse to the principle of competitive examination, in conformity with the recommendation of Her Majesty's Commission6rs on Civil and Military Appointments and Education, recorded In their reports recently pre sented to Parliament. That the candidates nominated by the Commander-in-Chief for commissions in the Line be therefore sub ect to the condition of competitive examination previously to their being appointed to commissions; and that officers of a sufficient term of regimental servie, desirous of qualifying themselves for the Staff in the senior department of instruction or Staff school, should receive their admissions and final certificates of quaUfieation on the same principle. That commissioners, consisting of an equal number of military officers and civilians, should be nominated by the Secretary of State for the purpose of superin. tending '%iese examinations, and that the educational establishments for the EAne and Staff be under the direction of the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament for the administration of the army, and 'who is already charged with the control of the existing schools and examinations for the artillery, engineers, and the non-commissioned officers and privates of the army." CONSECRATION OF TH BISoHP OF NORWC.- Yesterday morning the Hon. and Rev. J. T. Pelham, D.D., was consecrated in the Darish church of St. Marylebone, of -which he hasbeen for thelast three years the rector, to the bishopric of Norwich, which beeame vacant by the resignation of the Right Rev. Dr. Hinds. It has very seldom happened that the consecration of bishops has taken place in our large metropolitan churches, and the ceremony therefore of making a chief pastor of the church has been to most people-even to Churchmen-a thing of mystery. The first departure from the abgmrd old plan of secrecy was adopted in 1842, when five oolonlal bishops were consecrated in Westminster Abbey. This was followed by the consecration of the Bishopg of Lincoln, Sierre Leone, and some others in Lambeth Church, and by the consecration of the Bishops of London and Graham's Town in Whitehll] chapel. n the ease of the Bishops of Glocester and Chr'st Church, last year, the old plan was resorted to, the ceremony being performed in the small chapel of Lambeth Palace; but this morning the objectionable practice of conseeration in a private chap-I was abandoned, and those who felt interested in the cer - imony had an opportunity of witnessing it in one of the largest of our parochial churches. A sermon vas preached by Mr. Venn, the secretary to the Church Missionary Society, after 'which the Bishop elect was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury by the Bsops of London, GI - cester and Britol, and Ripen, and then in the customary handws. adTh ted to the episcopate by the imposition of had.Tenew Bishol) was attended by Dr. Robert 3.

MONEY-MARKETaUZ CITYINlTBLLIGBNBE. Thureday Evening. The funds opened steadily to-day at the firm prices of last evening, and ultimately experienced a alight advance. The first transactions in Consols for the 9th of July were at 93 to i, and, although at one period there was a tendency to depression from the general inactivity of business, a better tone was observable at the close, and after regtular hours bargains were entered into at 93S to J. The Bank Court sat only a short time, and it is probable the question of an alteration in the rate of discount was not for a moment entertained. The demand for money, however, is comparatively moderate, and it is assumed that during the past week the position of the establishment must in all respects have been considerably strengthened. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92a to Ji; New Three per Cents., 921 to J; Exchequer Bonds, 988 to X; India Bonds, 7s. to 3s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premiulm. The amount of June Exchequer-bills sent in on Monday for which money has been demanded is believed not to exceed 300,0)01. Foreign securities also exhibited steadiness, and the advance in Turkish continues to be maintained, some of the Greek firms having been large purchasers. The Six per Cents. were negotiated at 956, ,, J, and S; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 101g. The general business comprisedChilian Six per Cents., 101i; the Three per Cents., 76 and 77; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 76i; the Three per Cents., 52k; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46 and:~; and 3Russian Four-and-a. tHalf per Cents., 98. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were G7f. 90c. for money, and 68f. lOc. for the end of tho month, showing a renewed tendency to flatness. In the absence of any telegraphic announcement it is anssumed that the Bank of France to-day have abstnined from lowering their rate of discount. This result, however disappointing to the speculators, must be regarded with great satisfaction by all other persons. The letters stats that during the last eight days the favourable tendency of the bullion has been entirely checked by large remittances to Lombardy, and by the extent of coin withdrawn to buy up five-francpieces in the provinces and elsewhere. The new Governor of the Bank, M. de Germiny, who has resigned the post of President of the Cr6dit Foncier, was to be installed to-day, and not only is it said that he is opposed to any immediate reduction in the rate of discount, but that one of the first acts of his admnistration will be to enter into another contract with Messrs. Rothschild for the purchase of 1,000,0001. of gold in London. An unfounded report had been eirculated that M. Pereire was about to resign the Presidency of the Cr6dit Mobilier. A further sum of about 50,0001. out of the late arrivals of Australian gold has been sold to theBank to-day, and an additional amount may possibly be taken there to-morrow. Of the 210,0001. brought by the Arago from New York to-day a portion was on French account, and the whole of the remainder has been purchaed for the same destination. The commercial advioes on this occasion report a considerable recovery in the stock-market, most of the principal railway securities having experienced a rise of 2 or 3 per cent. Erie was quoted 36j, Reading 80X, New York Central 86 to J, Panama 95 to J, and lllinois Central 39i to 40 premiumthe bonds 99i. Continued ease in the discountmarket, together with rather more favourable accounts from this side, were the causes of the improvement. The reports of the progress of the crops in the interior were likewise more satisfactory than had been anticipated. From California it is mentioned that the State Legislature had adjourned after pawsing tehe Bill for the recognition of the public debt; that the, newspapers continued to take the honest side; and that, although opinions were much divided, great hopes were entertained that the vote of the people in September would confirm the measure. Both agricultural and, mining operations had been impeded by drought, a total absence of rain having prevailed for two months. The last steamer from San Francisco had taken 105,0001. on English account, which will come by the next West India mail. The report of the committee of shareholders of the North of Europe Steam Company, appointed in March last after the discovery had been made that, while the company were paying dividends at the rate of 10 per cent., their capital was fast disappearing, has just been issued. A more complete exposi of utter indifference on the part of directors to the interests of their constituents was never presented. Captain Andreows, the managing director, was left with supreme power, and, although the fact of his remuneration being mawde to depend upon the amount of the dividends declared should*have suggested the strictest examination of his accounts, the correctness of every figure presented by him seems to have been taken for granted from the commencement of the undertaking in 1852 down to the moment when the fact was forced upon the board that the company, instead of being entitled to pay 10 per cent. dividends, were actually, in consequence of his extravagance and misrepresentations, on the 'verge of ruin. It now appears that out of a subscribed capital of 500,0001., a positive money lose of 74,382l. has been sustained; and that, after making the necessary allowance for depreciation in the value of the fleet, as well as for bad debts, &c., this will be increased to 136 0431. -more than a fourth of the entire capit'al is therefore gone. With regard tofuture prospects, the committee express a strong beEef that by economical and vigilant management a satisfactory return may be made upon the reduced capital, and that it would therefore be much better for the company in a remodelled form to continue their operations than to submit to the further sacrifices that might attend a forced sale of their property. At present 18 of the ships are in active employment (eight being chartered on remunerative terms), and nine are unemployed. A meeting of the shareholders is to be held on the 18th inst., and this is the point they will then be called on to decide. The committee have evidently drawn up their report in a most guarded manner, in order not to excite undue expectations, and it will most probably be foundithat their recommendations have been wisely formed. With respect to the conduct of the directors the committee make the announcement, which will have been anticipated, that nothing has transpired to impugn their integrity or motives. In other respects the facts must speak for themselves. That theyhave neglected duties which they undertook faithfully to perform cannot be denied, and that this omission has been of the most grievous kind is illustrated by the fact that, although Mfr. Coleman, the accountant, called the attention of the secretary and chairman to some serious discrepancies in the accounts of Captain Andrews in October, 1856, no notice was taken of them the chairman, in the presence of some of his colleagues, assuring a deputation of shareholders, four months afterwards, that the concern was in a sound state, and that a suggestion made by T7e Times for an immediate investigation was wholly unjustifiable. It is true that the directors themselves are large holders of the stock and that they consequently participate heavily in the general loss, but it is no excuse that in neglecting the trust reposed in them by othlers they have also neglected their duties to themselve3 and their families. Their position at the board was an honourable and profitable one, and they accepted its advantages without giving anything in return. The Spanish Financial Commission have advertised an anction of the foreign redeemable debt at Madrid on the 30th inst., for- which purpose 375,000 reales have been assigned by the Government.

RAILW-AY INTELLIaE'N(E. F{ARTLEPOOL. A special meetine on this Dock and Railway Company was held ac Hlartlepool, on Wednesday, Mr. R Burdon wn tbe chair. The CHLUIRNAN stated, that the object of the meeting was to consider a Bill now before Parliawent for the anmal gamation of this company with the North-E ,stern Railway company. Eight years ago the company lca. ed the docks and railway to the North-Easter Compaixy for a term of 31 years, of which 22 h-ad yet to run, at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum. According to the terms of the agreement an amalgamation hetween thetwo compauies was to he effected upon a request to that effect being made by either of them. Suchrequesthad now been made bytheRartlepoXICtmpany to the North-Eastern Company, because it was felt by the directors that many important matters wvhich ought long since to have been attended tohad beensuffered to rernain in abeyance by the North-gastern Company, who were led to act thus from the fact of their temporary tenure. Accordit,g to their agreement the company would continue to be paid interest at the rate of 8 per cent. uLpon the capital uatll the expiration of the present lease, after which they would receive the same dividend as the then shareholders in the NorthEastern. It was to the interest of the company that the amalgamation sbould take place. Their railway was comparatively a smaU one and confined to a limiited district, ihe coal traffic being supplied chiefly by the Thornley, Baswell, and Castle Eden collieries. The surrounding traffic was in the hands of the North-Eastern Company. Be concluded by moving a formal resolution, approving the Bill. The motion was put and carried unanimously. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chairman andI directors BRISTOL AND EXETER. Mr. J. B. Marwood, late chief clerk in the accountants'office of the Great Western Railway at Paddington, has been appointed chief accountant of the above company, in the room of Mr. W. Harwood, recently elected to the secretaryship, vacant by the resignation of Mr. J. B. Badham. There were between 70 and 80 candidates for the appointment, the salary of which is 4001 per annum. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RAILWAY BILLS. Sr. IIELEN'S. Mr. FrrzRoY reported from the committee that the principal object of the BiU is to enable the St. Helen's Canal and Railway Company to raise additional capital for the .\piompletion and general purposes of the undertaking. The yIzmmittee had examined the allegations of the Bill, and had amnended the preamble by striking out al that relates to the Inverpool Dock and Town Dnes Bill, provisions relating to which form a separate Bill, introduced by special leave of the House, and the committee had found the preamble so amended to be true. SrTTINGBOUnNE AND SHEERNESS. Mr. FITZROY reported from the committee that the deviations, extensions, now lines, and other works proposed to be authorized by the Bill are to be executed by an existin company out of funds which they are at present authorized to raise, and are to form part of an existing undertaking, The recommendation of the Board of Trade with respect to pier dues and dues on shipping had been adopted by the committee. The aggregate length of the proposed new lines, six in number, is 4 miles 2 furlongs 15 chains. The first is 2 miles 2 chains in length the second, 50 chains; the third, 22 chaius; the fourth, 50 chains; the fifth, 45 chains; and the sixtb, 26 chains in length. The steepest gradient is 1 in 107. It is intended to cross one road on the leveL The estimated cost of the works is 45,5201., and the quantity of land required is 29i acres. Mr. Birkenshaw was the engineer examined in support of the Bill, and the committee were satisfied of the fitness, in an engineering point of view, of the proposed railway and works.

HmlAw.%Y ROBBERY UNrDER COlLOROFORIi.-LaSt night information was received by the metropolitan police of a most extraordinary highway robbery, committed at tTlverstone, by the aid of chloroform. It seems that Mrs. Elizabeth Savage, housekeeper to Mr. Pennington, of Brarndrake's Head, was returning home abont nooa-day from Ulvenstons, with some articles of wearing appareL 'When near Lowick-bridge she was seized by three men and a womanm, one of whom put a bottle to her nose, supposed to contain chloroform, when she lost all consciousness. When she camo to herself she found that she had not only been robbed of her bundle and purse containing a small sum of money, but also of the whole of the wearing apparel she bad on her person, the ruffians having left her i a com- lete state of nudity. Delicacy kept hirs. Savage within fhe shelter of the wood, where she had been dragged, but at length she succeeded in attracting the attention of two of her own sex, and, the requisito clothing having been obtained, Mrs. Savage was relieved from her very unpleasant position. The police have a full description of the fellows, and there is no doubt they will soon be in coustody. A GREATGRCANDSON OF SIR WALTER SCOTr.-The perpetuity of a great name has a natural and universal, if somewhat sentimentall intere.st, and we take blame to ourselves for not havmg more promptly noticed the announcement of the bir'h of a son to Mr. Hope Scott of Abbotsford, which renews the prospect of the continuance of the family and name of oar great poet and novelist. Mrs. Hope Scott is Sir Walter's only surviving grandchild, and the infant born on the 2d instant his sole representative in the fourth generation. Should the child who thus inherits this illustrious name happily live to bear it and to transmit it, it will be, we may without exaggeration say, a gratification to his country ; and the prospect has the further interest of its promising the fulfilment of one of the dearest wishes of Sir Walter Scott's heart, for in him te desire to perpet-uate his name and family was the special sha,pe taken by the "last infirmity of noble minds."

APPEALS. HOUSE OF LORDS. J= 11. MEDDIE V. BROWN AND OTHERS. This was an appeal from certain interlocutors of the First Divisionof the Court of Session in Scotland pronounced in a cause wherein the appellmt was pursuer and the respondents were defenders. Mr. Rolt and Mr. Anderson were counsel for the appellant; and the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate represented the respondents. It appeared that the respondents as tenants of the colliery and farm of Holbeath received a sum of money from a railway company as compensation for the injury they should sustain during the remainder of their lease from the construction of the railway. The respondents, finding that the colliery didnotpayforworkiug, availedtheraselvesofa olause in their lease enabling them under thoso circumstances, and gave it up before the term of its natural expiration. The appellant, as proprietor in trnst of the colliery, contended that the respondents were bound to pay over to him such part of the sum received from the railway company for aamage to the estate as was proportional to the unexpired portion of the lease posterior to the date of their giving up possession of the colliery. The respondents, on the con. trary, contended that the money received by them from the railway company had no reference to the appellant or his rights and interest, but related exclusively to themselves; and that therefore the appellant had no claim to any portion of it. The Court of Sesson decided in favour of the respondents, when the'present appeal was brought. Their LORDSEPS, without hearing the arguments on behalf of the respondents, dismissed the appeal with costs.
LA W 1EPOBT. COURT OF CHANCERY, JuxE u. Ix Lm-ucy. WVejore ue JORDS JusTiCMs of APPw) RE MOREIS This was a petition to confirm the report of one of the Masters in Lunacy in the matter of Ann Morris, a lunatic, and to appoint now trustees of the wills of the father and one of the brothers of the lunatic. The only points requiring a report were whether such a petition should be entitled in Chanceryt as well as in Lunacy, and how the costs of the petition suaould be borne. Mr. BRIsTowx, for the petitioners) stated that it was doubted in the Lunacy-office whether such petitions should be entitled in Chancery as well as in Lunacy, although the jurisdiction as to appointing trustees being under the Trustee Act was alrenady in Chancery. He also submitted that as the only specialty in the report which rendered it necessary to apply to the Court was the difiiculty of appointing new trustees of the wills in question, the costs of the petition should come out of the estates of the two testators eally, and not out of the lunatic's estate. It appeared that all the persons interested under the two wills were co-petitioners, and that they left the question as to thg costs entirely to the Court. Their LORDsnus thought that the petition ought to be entitled in Chancery as well as in Lunacy, as the jurisdic. tion of the Court so far as the appointment of neow trustees was concerned was under the Trustee Act; and they thought it reasonable that under the circumstances mentioned the costs of the petition should be borne evually by the estates of the two testators and ordered accordingly.

ROLLS' COURT, CEUNCmEY-LAM TTv 11 Uu WIV 1;#AW V. HARDY. (iiejore tge ASTE of the RoLLs.) His RONOmR,, in proposing to give judgment in this case, expressed a doubt whether the facts of the ease were sufficiently before the Court to enable him to pronounce a definite opion upon it, and subsequently justified such doubt by leaving the principal question in issue an open one. The case was somewhat peculiar and as follows :- Two brothers, James and John, executed on the 3d of April, 1832, two contemporaneous deeds, by which John settled the whole of the property he then possessed, subject to the retention of a life interest, on James, and James did precisely the same in respect to his property in favour of John. John died in 1838, and in virtue of the settlement above mentioned the whole of his property passed to James, but in such a manner that according to the wording of the two deeds taken together the whole of both James and John's property reverted to the representatives of John unless James either by a subsequent will or deed revoked his settlement of 1832. James, it appeared, had executed both a subsequent will and deed, but without expressing any intention of revoking the deed of 1832, or dealing with the property such deed covered, exeept that in the subsequent deed it was contended that part of such property was by implication necessarily included Whether this were so or not, the Court had not before it at present sufficient evidence to show, and the case therefore stood over to be mentioned again. Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Faber, and Mr. Smythe appeared in the case.
VICE-CANCELLORS' COURTS. JTx i-a bIBLBY V. MLUTON. (Before Vwe-CahncdUor Sir R. T. KINDmisL.R,) nls Dniu was nlied by kHenry Sibley, a shareholder in the Wheal Guscus Mining Company, in Cornwall, to restrain an action brought against him by the defendant, a creditor of the company, under these circumstances :-ln 1855 the plaintiff held a number of shares in this company, which was a copper mining company on the cost-book prinple. Among the rules regulating the concern it was provided that no transfer of shares should be registered unless all the cals werepaid, and there was a power for the shareholders at a generaL meeting to declare shares upon which cals were in arrear, after notice, forfeited. Each shareholder had power to retire by giving written notice of his intention, In December, 1855, the plaintiff held 463 shares, upon which a call of 5s. was made. After this call the plaintiff sold all his shares except 127, and the transfer was entered in the cost-book, and the remaining 127 shares were also sold, and the transfer also entered in the cost-book. Application was made to the plaintiff for payment of his eall en all his shares, amounting to 1151. 15s., by the secretary and purser of the company, and about a month subsequently another letter was sent to him, requesting immediate payment on a particular day, and stating that unless such pay ment was made his name would be handed over to merchant creditors to recover the amount. In July, 1856, the shares were declared forfeited, and notice sent of such forfeiture to Mr. Sibley, and 127 of such shares were sold as above by the committee of management. In August, 1856, a person named Mtchell, and creditor of the company broughb the action now sought to be restrained against the plaintiff to recover 3481. 14s. for goods sold and delivered to the use of the company. A negotiation then took place for a compromiee, and a correspondence on the subject, but eventualy this bill was filed for an injunction, which was granted on the terms of paying the 115l. 15s. into court, the plaintiff's caso being that the action was brought at the instigation of and by collusion with the company by their secretary, and making other questions upon the osition of the plaintiff as a shareholder, and the bill was nled against three shareholders of the company, as members of the committee of management and representing the company, and against Afichell, the creditor. A preliminary objection was taken by the three defendants esoribed as members of the committee of management, on the ground that they were unnecessary and improperparties, inasmuch as they did not and could not represent the company, which was a' simple partnership on the cost-book princi le, and the plaintiff sueing singly, and not on behalf oI himeelf and al the other shareholders, could have no relief against the three defendants as representing the company, having no power to bind the company without the consent of all the shareholders, who were neceesary parties. Moreover, no collusion was proved, and wa eidby the1 three defendants, who never authorized the letter threatening the action. The VICE-CHANCELLOR held that the objection was a valid one, and that aU the defendants did not represent the company, this being a mere partnership. The case was then heard on motion for decree and argued on the merits, Michell denying positively any collusion, but stating that the plaintiff having suggested that he (Michell) should proceed at law against another party he thought he might as well proceed against him (the plaintiff). Mr. Glasse and Mr. F. S. Williams appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. Baily and Mr. Elderton for Michell, and Mr. Roxburgh for the three shareholders. The VTCE-CHANCELLOR thought that the plaintiff was entitled to a perpetual injunction, it being the rule that though a creditor might bring an action against a member of a joint-stook company, yet if there was collusion that would be entirely restrained. This case came within that principle, but, inasmuch as the plaintiff had suggested to iNchell a like proceeding against another person, as to Michell without costs; and as an account was required the three defendants must have the bill d1swissed against themi without costs. The 1151. 15s. ranus- be repaid to the plaintiff. (Before Vice-Chancetlor Sir W. P. WoOD.) THE COLLLNS COPAiINY V. COHEN. This case came on by way of demurrer to the biU for walilt of equity. The plaintiffs were membem of a compnuy formed in Connecticut, in North ArneHica. ffr- inanufant ing edge-tools. The defendant was a mni-ch ., lBir-r !- ham. The bill prayed an aCcount of thep ^ - _ la the manufacture, sile, exportation. or gj -.t of tools having the coripany's m'-ks - labe .. -,arks or labels similar to, or co1onr,i-iy difte..g from their own; it asked payment of profits so made, and that such tools and instrnmen-z, naving such marks or labels, might be given up to have the marks and labels effaced and destroyed; and also asked that all such blocks, stamps, plates, and labels might be delivered up for the like purpose. It also sought to restrain the defendant from stamping, cutt-in or engraving any tools mado by him with the words Coflins and Co.-Bartford cast steel-warranted," or other words leading to the behef that such tools or instraments were made by the company. Mr. Rolt and Mr. Eddis were for the plaintiffs. Mr. CAIRNS and MIr. C. SNVANSTONT in support of the demurrer, contended that, as the plaintiffs were aliens, their right could not be recognized in this country to any exclusive mark or designation giving them privileges similar to those of copyright or patent. If there was any case of fraud, it was not pretended that such fraud was perpetrated here, but in America, where the jurisprudence of the country would doubtless be found adequate to the repression of any attempt to injure the plaintiffs. No injury could result to the company in America from the refusal of an }lsh court of equity to interfere, the case being out of English jurisdliction. The VIY CHa1ELLrO. said that he had no doubt what. ever in the case. The remarks of Lord Langdale in the case of " Perry v. TrmefittV' (6, Beavan, 73), upon an in. fringgement of this descri tion, were precise and cleu -- *I think (said Lord Lan4gale) that the principle on which both the courts of law and of equity proceed in cranting relief and protection in cases of this sort is very we under. stood. A man is not to sell his Own goods under the pre tence that they are the goods of another man; he cannot bo pernitted to practise such a deception, nor to use the means which contribute to that end. He cannot, therefore be allowed to use names, marks, letters, or other indiQa by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person. I own it does not seem to me that a man can acquire a property mezely in a name or mark, but, whether he has or not a property in the name or the mark, I have no doubt that another petson has not a iight to use that name or mark for the purpose of deceotion and In order to attract to himself that course of trade or that custom which without that improper act would have flowed to the person who first used or was alone in the habit of using the particular name or mark. The case had nothing to do with any cases as to copyright. The only question was, had a fraud been perpetrated? There could be no doubt that every subject of every country (not even perhaps exceptrcg the case of an alien enemy) had a right to apply to the courte of this country to have a fraudu2ent injury to his property arrested at the fountain-head, and it would be a most grievous state of things if there were any incapacity in any court to prevent a fraud being committed on a subject of any country. TEZ COLLNS COIPAhY V. BROWN. This was a similar case of demurrer. The defendant was a saw and steel manufacturer in Sheffield. The bill, as in the former case, prayed an account of profits, the delivcry up of the blocks, plates, &c., of the labels, and asked for au injunction to restrain the sale and manufacture of the tools and labels as in the former case. Mr. Rolt and Mr. Eddis were for the company. His Hoxoum gave a similar decision. Mr. M ARTIN-uyE, on behalf of tho defendant, said he was instructed by his client to make a public apology for any injury he might have done by the imitation of the company's trade mark. His HoxouR said such an apology was creditable to the defendant, who had, as he hoped, been unknowingly made instrumental in working an injury to the plaintiffs. He knew of no offence of amore disgraceful character than this, next to offenoes of an indictable nature.
COIJRT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, WEsT3wqrp, JjulE U. _ jHM QUEEN V. LORI) ERNT VMNE TEMPEST. Izztngs -zn Banco-, beorLoird CAMPBELL and JuStica COLEPIDGE, URLE. and CRO3MPTOi,Tl oil .. 2G eremmc'ed the Court thatsome time sinoe they had granted a rule rui for a criminal information to be filed against lord Ernest Vane Tempest. The rule had been enlarged from time to time in consequence of the difficulty of serving a copy of it personally upon Lord Ernest Vane Tempest, but no special directions had been given as to its service. The affidavit on which the learned counsel now moved stated that his Lordship had gone abroad, and that all attempts to fiid him had failed; but that in the course of last month the deponent heard that he had returned to this country, and was living with the Dowager Lady Londonderry, in Park-lane. He accordingly went to the house, and, having knocked at the door, asked a livery servant who opened it if Lord Ernest Vane Tempest was within. The servant said he was not. The deponentshowed the servant the rule, and said ho wished to serve his Lordship with a copy, and asked the servant to give 2t to his L.ordship. The servant answered, " I can't give it him till be comes in." Under these circumtnces, the learned counsel submitted that this was sufficient service to entitle him to make the rule absolute. Lord CAmiBELL-The afridavit states the belief of the deponent that Lord E. V. Tempest was living with the maarchioness? Sir F. T EsIGEIt said Vt did, and that the service in Park. lane took place on the 15th of May. Lord CAMPBELL said there was not the smallest doubt that Lord E. V. Tempest had had notice of the rule, and that he might have shown cause, if he had wished. The rule must be absolute. Rule absolute. THE QUEEN V. ALLGOOD. In this case the Court had granted a rule, calling upon T. M. Allgood, a printer at Worcester, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him for a libel published by him in a handbill on the 27th of March last. The rule was granted on the application of2 Mr. Alderman Sidney, who stated that in the year 1847 he was returned as M.P. for the borough of Stafford; at which election Mr. H. W. Meteyard, barrister-at-law, was a candidate, but did not go to the polL At the last election Mr. Alderman Sidney was a candidate for the representation of the city of Worcester, and on the day of nomination, the 27th of March, a handbill was circulated in the city, of which the following was a copy:- "HFowV AI;DER..U- fiLDsY oasNtn nSa SEAT rOR STA'FORD. Oaford nlmit piwomrasrede tho daushter of Dr Kih. an,minet seat inaribrament f^or Szta^fford. He metao 1it asccessful canvar, and seuceeded in obtaining a majorit oftheo promie, and his ret;urn seemed acertainty. He vvas nominated and accpted asthe popnulaz U Mr. S5eteyard had in the year 1845, duoing the railway mania, oined several provlsional railway directions, and, unfortunately, a u,a uent for a railway debi to a large amount had been obtained " Alderman Sidney was a candidate for Stafford. He and his friends. fearing the popularity of Meteyard and his oertain suc V irchased this railway judgment, caused an executonto be issued aoineted Meteyara. w o was arrested by the beriff's oficer on the erening,previous tothe day of election, and he was taken to gaol, and did uttobtain hiszreleasetillalter the election. This publfic digrace Drayed on or Meteyard's mind, and insa few 0weeks he died. * rted by T. AL AIgood, Broad-street, Woroester." Mr. Alderman Sidney in his affidavit declared that he had never chased any interest in any such judgment against Mrx. metyard, nor did he know that any such judgment had baen pIurchased by any person; that he had never caused the said Mr. Meteyar xto be arrested, nor did any friend of his or any person to his knowledge cause him to be arrested, or any execution to be issued against him. He further ststed that he was informed and beleved that Mr. Meteyard lived for more than three years after the said election. Sir F. KELLY and Mr. PHiPsoN now showed cause against the rule, and contended that it oughttobedischarged, upon the ground that the defendant, who was merely the printer of the handbill, had immediately given up the name of the author, and had in the most unreserved mianner expressed his regret for its publication, and done all that a respectable man could do. The learned connsel read over the libellous handbill complained of, and the affidavits on whioh the rule was granted, as above set forth, and an additional affidavit now made by a gentleman named Frederick Ash, to prove publication. Hle then read an affidavit in answer, made by George Millard, the defendant's apprentice, who stated that at about 2 o'clock, on the 28th of March last (the day after the publcation), the said Mr. Ash c meto theprintinz-officeand asked for some of the handbills, sayig, " They are fora goodcause, and we aregettin dozens of votes by it." The boy told him he had none by him, but Mr. Ash several times urged him to print him some, saymg "ID- it, let's have come," and he lent the boy his knife to cut some paper on which to print them. This being done, the boy printed six oopies, and Mr. Ash took them away, giving his card, and adding his address, " Snow-hill, Birmingham," but saying that he was then staying in Worcester, at the house of Mr. Inchle, another brother-in-law of Mr. Alderman Sidney's. In about a quarter of an hour Mr. Alderman Sidney came to the office with Mr. Inchle and Mr. Ash, and, on Mr. Alderman Sidney's asking 3fr. Allgood the defendant) by whose authority he printed the handbill Mr. Allgoodrepled bystatingthenameof the gentleman. Upon that Mr. Inchle said, "Oh," and repeatedthe name, and Mr. Allgood said, " Yes." Mr. Alderman Sidney then said he would bring an action against Mr. Allgood, and Mfr. Allgood said he was sorry for having printed the bil if it was not correct, but that his presses were as free for him (Mr. Sidney) as for any one else, and that he had printed for him. Mr. Alderman Sidney then shook his fist at Mr. Allgood, and said, " I will teach you liberal religious men a lesson." Mr. Alderman Sidney then asked Mr. Allgood his Christian name, and was told that it was Thomas Matthew. He then said he had lost several votes by the bill, upon which Mr. Inchle said, " Yes, dozens," and Mr. Ash said, " Scores." The deponent identified the handbill produced to the Court as one of those which he had printed for Mr. Ash, and this was done by the absence of a letter, which had dropped out in moving the form. The learned counsel also had an affidavit made by the defendant's fore3man, William Fester, who confirmed some parts of the apprentice's affidavit, particularly as to what ocourred when r. Alderman Sildney came to the office, and added that Mr. Allgood told Mr. Alderman Sidney he did not know that he was doing wrong in printingthe bill, and when the parties were going away Mr. Inchle said to hr. Allgood that the alderman would probably proceed against the gentleman for whom Mr. Allgood had pnnted the bill. The learned counsel then read the affidavit of Mr. Allgood himself, who stated that his business was that of a printer only, and that he did not seU by retail in any manner. He said that on the 27th of farch last a gentleman living in Worcester, who was taking a part in tho proceedings of the said election on behalf of the former members, Mr. Laslett and MIr. 0. Ricardo, brought to him a paper to be printed, and that under his directions he prited a number of copies. The next day, the 28th of murch, Mr. Alderman Sidney, Mr. Ash, and Mr. Inchle came to his office, and when Mr. Alderman Sidney asked him by whose authority he printed the bil he immediately gave the name of the gentleman, upon which Mr. Inchle said, " Oh I" and repeated the christian and surname which ir. Allgood had mentioned. Mr. Alderman Sidney then said he would bring an action against Mr. AhUgood, to which he replied that he was sorry for having printed the biU if it wns m.t correct, but that his presses were as free to print 'or him (Mr. Alderman Sidney) as for any one else, and that he had printed for him. Mr. Alderman Sidney then, shakimg his fist at him; said, I wiU teach you so-called liberal gentlemen to know better." The learned counsel proceeded to contend that Mr. Alderman Sidney had not acted fairly in coming to the court under these circumstances. He knew perfectly well who the real author of the handbill was,-a gentleman hving in Worcester, whose name Mr. Incblo recognized - hbt instead of proceeding against him he had gone against the printer, who had immediately given up his uthority, and expre5sed his regret bf Mr. Alderman Sidney. Itf LwausH soortended thatd a gentleman who had "clinched" or "s8haken his fist at the detendant was ntot entitled to the interference of the Court said it watadmitted that this was a libel for whichl M. AldermaniMSidney was entitled to come to this Court, for it was not eoily calculated, but intended, to do him serious injury. But it was pretended the printer was ignorant of the contents of the libel. Lord CAMPBELL said hle did g not think that was relied on ; bn f it was, it wouldbe ured in vAn Sir F. T sOiER.-What excuse, then, was there made ? M1r. Allgod. had not expremed any re_gret at all. All he hadaIIvwaathathewasorry for printing itif it was not correot, and thati his presses were open to Mr. Alderman Sidner as well Ea for aybdi evlae, Xn what grond, then, was Mr. Alderman Sidney disentitled to the interference of the Court ? Firt, it was said the defendant had -give up the name of the author. Bat that was not eufficent, for it would be necesy to have the defendanVs auistgnoee to bing the case home to that party; nd the defendant might refuse to give evidence. T'Iere had, therefore, been no proof of condonation. Then it was said the proof of publication had been obtained by stratagem. It was obtained in 'che~~~~~~~~h ordinary waayt theordiar way,T said itc was not the ordinary way to Etate what was untrue. There was a misstatement. Sir F. THcESIGER.-Mr. Alderman Sidney did not authorize that he was no party to what was done by Ash. Then it was said that Mr. Alderman Sidney had sought redreEs by "shalking" or "clinching his fist" at Mr. Ailgood, and saying, " I will teach you liberal religious men a lesson." The learned counsel ridiculed the notion that this was takdng his redresg into his own hands * he there. fore contended that the rul ought to be made abrolute. Lord CAMPIBELL said he was of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged. The handbill contained a grows libel in chirging Mi. Alderman Sidney with disgraceful conduct, which would expose him to be proceeded against for a breach of the privilege of Parliament; and if he had proceeded against the author of the libel he would have nad good ground for a criminal information. He would a!so havo had good groundforacriminalinformationagainst e print;er under certain circumstances, but not under the cicumsances of this case, as shown in the affidavits. It could not be said that the printer was relieved by saying that his pres was open, and that he was ready to publish a deniaL. e (ord Campbell) also disapproved of the Uanguage of Mr. Ailgood, that he did not know that he had done wrong, for he ought to have known that. But, look. ag at the hole of the transaction; he (Lord Campbell) thought Mr. Alderman Sidney wa3 not entitled to call upon the Court to make the rule absolute. His lordship thought that, however respectable Mr. Alderman Sidney's general charaeter might be, he had not conducted himself with propr ety in this instance; and his Lordship instanced his em. ploying a person by stratagem to get evidence against All. good. It was said he (Mr. Alderman Sidney) did not instruct Ash as to the false representation he was to make, but it was proved that it was made, and he (Mr. Alderman Sidney) now sought to take advantage of the information which had then been obtained. Then, immediately that complaint was made to the printer the namo of the autior was given, a gentleman living in Worcester, and known to all, even to Mr. Inchle, the brother-in-law of Mr. Alderman Sidney, and whom he iumchle) thought was a fit person to be proceeded against as the author of the libel. When Mr. Allgned said ho was not aware that he had done wrong, and said he was sorry he (Lord Campbell) thought he meant to express his regret, and there could be no doubt that what he said intimated that if there should be a proceeding aainst tho author ho would do ali he could. After this Mtr. Alderman Sidney was not entitled to come to this court for a criminal information. His (Mr. Alderman Sidney's) affldavits were disingenuously framed. All that was stated in Ash's affidavit was trau e but he had suppressed what waS muaterial, and what ougit to have been brought before the Court. Under allthecircumstances, he 5Lord Campbell)was of opinion that ths rule ought to be discharged, but without costs. 3r. Justico CoIXroGE was of tho same opinion. In the prosecutor's affidavits there was a silence as to important fact which could hardly have been thought to be.imma. teral or have escapeda recollection. His Lordship thought that in candour Mr. Alderman Sidney ought not to have asked Allgood for the information, unless he meant to pro. ceed against the author. He (Mr. nustice Coleridge) could not distinguish Mr. Alderman Sidney's conduct from that of his.relative, Mr. Ash, and there was strong ground for oeliisevig that Mr. Alderman Sidney knew the way in which Ah had been acting. But nothing of that a peared in the affidaits on which the rule was granted. ff as the printer had conducted himself, and insufficient as his excuse was, yet, considering that be had expressed his regret, his Lordsip thought that, under the circumstances, tho rulo must be discharged. The other Judges expressed similar opinions. Rule discharged, without costs. THE QUE V. PAHER SND OTHES. This was a rule calling upon certain justices to issue their waluatto levy a poor rate assessed upon the London and North-Westes Railwas Company. SirzF. KELLY (Withlwhom was r. Bittleston) nowshowed cause against the rule. It appaed that severa^l rates which had been appealed agsinest ad been paid by the company, pending the apeals; hut in the result the rates were lowered, thus leaving a balance belonging to tho corn p ny in the hands of the parish oicers. The company nished to have thepresentate hquxdlatedbythe sunmi the hands of the parish; butdit was intimated by the auditor that thishwold he illegl, without an order of sessions. The company were summoned before the justices for the non-payment of the rate, but tho justices, on proof of the facts, refused to issue their warrant. Lord CAMIPBELL inquired what hew difficult rwas. pri. Serjeant HAYEs (with whom was Mr. A. w Adams) sald there was no difficulty, except tho legal dificulty sung gested by the auditor to the parish offlcers. The learned counsel referred to the 43d of George II, cap. 23, sections Lord CAicPBELL said Poor lav auditor were much to be praised, but not in stirring up controversy. It was out of the question for this Court to grant a mandbamus to do a maofest injustice. The parish of.icers would do well to make the allowance; anod they would not incurany danger in so doing. The other Judges wrea of the same opinion. Rule discharged. THE QUEF v.

A complaint had been made to the magistrates against a man named Baker for deserting his master's service, and on the hearing of the complaint Roberts appeared as the advocate of Baker. It vas the same case as had already been before this Court on a haecas corpus, when the Court held that the servant was liable to be committed a second time for not retunming to his service, but he was subsequently discharged by the Court of Exchequer. The learned coun=s! read Roberts's speech, in which he told the justies that if they committed the accused they would decide against law, reason, and jnstice, &c.

COUIT OF COMMON PLEAS, WESTNSmx, JoT,lU. DE INY V. FOX. te,eJOM .Lora UAWhJ Justice COTCKBVW. aznd Justi= ORXSs- WELLP W mAM, and WALE) This Ws an actlon of trespass for breaking and entering the cottage of the plaintiff, to which the defendant pleaded liberum tenemetum. At the trial the defendant began, and proved that he had let the cottage in question to thle plainftif, had given a notioe to quit, and afterwArdstakeu possesson. The plaintiff, in answer, proved that before tk;ll letting to her by the defendant the cottage had been left 1o, will to a r. Knowles, who, after the letting, had claimea the cottage, and requested the plaintiff to pay her the rent, and that sho had pad it The verdict was for the plantiff. A rule nis to enter tho verdict for the defendant having been obtained, Mr. CLEASBY now showed cause. He argued that the doctrine that a tenant is Ã¯Â¿Â½etopped from disputing his land tlordstitle is tapible only ian action of ejectment by the landlord, Pthatit Iasts only during the tenancy, and that in this cethe tenancy had been put an end to by A enatructive eviction by the rel owner. Mr. MAISsTY and Mr. BrEW, contra, argued that the plaintiff was in this case estopled by the ordinary rule, although the form of action was in trespass; that there wa no evidence of a constractive eviction, and that a constructive eviction by the claimant to the property wouldnot havFe enabled the tenant to dispute her landlord's title. The LonDlClxp JUSTICs, in giving judgments said that the rule mnst be made absolute, that the ordinary rule of estoppel was as applicable in this action as in an actior of ejectment, that in this case there was no eviction, actual or constructive, and that the Court doubted much whether a constructive eviction, to besstWined by evidence of &threatened evictionbya claimanttoproperty, and a,consequent payment of rent by the tenant, could enable the tenant to say that such claimant was the real owner of the estate, rather than his landlord from whom he received nossessioi; that Euch a ruling would emable claimants of property, by collusion with the tenants, to avoid the necessity of malhng out their title in an action of ejectment, and put owners in pos seEsion of estates to disclose their title, 'wbach mighfendanger many famniles. Rule absolute. GORuIS AND OTBERS V. PZBRI' U AND OTvRRS. In this case the Court delivered judgment. The action was brought on a contract for the sale of a number of bales of gambia on board the Lady Agnes Duff. The Wales which arrived were not of the customary weight of bales of that commodity, but there were other bales on board the vessel which would have satisfied the contract The question raised in the argument was whether, as the bales were to arrive by a particular ship, the contract was conditional that the goods were on board that ship, and should arrive. The Court, were of opinion that the statement that the goods were on board the ship amounted to a warranty, and that the rule must he discharged. Rule discharged. TKIXYu V. R}STO1 AND ANOTHIE, In this case also the Court delivered judgment. This was an action for the infringement of a patent for pumping water by centrifugal force. The patent was taken out in 1846. The invention claimed as new was a whoel with hollow spokes, communicating with the water to be raised, and having a channel on either side the wheel to avoid the friction caused by suction. The pleas raised the question whether theinvention was new, and it was contended at the trial before Mr. Justice WiUes that the inventionwas not new. The learned judge was of opinion that the invention had been disclosed, and directed the jury ccordingly. Tho Court were of opinion that for anything comn municated to the public by Hale's patent the invention and patent might be good; but Ruthven's patent of circular pans was almost identical with the invention of the plaintiff, and the method of introducing the water on both sides the wheel must be taken to have been learned by the plintiff from Rutiven. The raising of water by centrifugal force mot being claimed by the plaintiff as his invention, ,the Court were of opinion that the judgmaent :of the learned dge who tried the cause was right, and that this rule must Dedischarged.-Rule discharged. ANDREWS V. BELFIELD. This was an action by Mr. Andrews, the celebrated carriage builder of Southampton, against a gentleman in Hampshire, for the prico of a carriage,in which the plintiff recovered a verdict for 9&. A rule for a nonsuit, or for a new trial having been obtained on the ground that the contract was a concitional one, Mr. Edwin James, q.C., and Mr. Hawkins showed cause against the rule, and Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Kus lake appeared in support of it. It appearedthat the carriage was to be made, subject to the defendant's approval, and that the defendant did not approve of it. For tho plaintiffit was contended thatthejury had found that the carriage was built according to the defendant's plan, and in a mannerthat ought to have satisfied any reasonable person. For the defendantiit was contended tha. in the contract it was left to the defendant to reject the carriage if it was not built according to his convenience and taste ; that it was not built accordin to the defendant's convenience and taste, and that his objectoin was a ond4flde one. The CounT thought the rule ought to be maade absolute. The defendant had objected to the drawing of the carriage and had only given an order for the carriage on conditi,,n that it was built in accordance with his convenience and wishes. That order had never been completed, and therefore the defendant was not liable. Rule absolute for a nonsuit. PAINTER V. THE LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTE COAST RAILWAY. Mr. XLus moved for a rule against the defendants, calling on them to show cause why an Injunction should not issue against them, enjoining them not to give certain cab-proprietors at Brighton an undue preference and advantage in admitting their cabs to the station-yard on the arrival of trains Mr. Justice CRESSWELr-We have already rejected stuch an application, if it is a mere application on behalf of cab owners. Mr. LUSH said this was a case in which the public were concerned. At Brighton there were a great number of cabs, but the company had restricted the privilege of entering their yard and plying for passengers on the arrival of trains to five cab proprietors, who owned altogether 56 cabs, and would not allow other cabs into their yards. The consequence was that when there was an unusually large arrival of passengers the public had to -wait till the cabs first engaged returned, as there were not enough at. the station to accommodate them, and were frequently kept waiting In the rain. In London the company took a different course, and allowed every cab proprietor to come in his order and turn to their station. Mr. Justice CREssWEwT.-Have you any affidavit of complaint from any of the public except a cab proprietor9 Mr. LusH.-No, my Lord. lr. Justice CRESSWR,-I is very kinaof the cab proprietors to take care of the public, but unless some of the public complain and make the application we cannot grant the rule. The Court ought to be satisfied that there was some real injury to the public and have some complaint on their behalf. It was those who used the railways who were to complain, not the railway proprietors or the proprietors of cabriolets. Rule refused.
COURT OF XCMO0UE.R T1TR1RnA-V .T- 17 HUI1'T V. THE NORTIH ST.AFFORS E RAT T TrA- (Sitting in BRa2M.1 mx. OCOTLA2iD snowed cause against arnile to set aside an order of Mr. Justice Coerldge whereby the plaintiff was prohibitea from proceeding with a plaint in the Stafford. shire County Court, at Stoke-upon.Trent, onx the ground tbat, though his demand was nominally to recover monLey paidl and timo expended on behalf of the defendants, it waLs, mnfact, a roceeding for the recovery of damages for a.n alleged 3niacious prosecution, over which the County Court has no jurisdliction. It appeared that the brother of the plaintiff had made himaself amenable to the bylaws of the company, and that they by mistake causedthe plaintiff to be brought up before a mnagistrate for that offence, and the avowedl object of the plaintiff's plaint was to recover the expenses he had been put to by reason of that mnistake. It was now contended for the defendants that the proceeding of the _plaintiff was colourable, and that therefore the order of the learned judge prohibiting the Court and the plaintiff fronm its furtle'r prosecution was perfectly correct. Mr. HUD3DLESTON having been heardl lin support of the rule, andl in opposition to the order of the learned judge, The CouRT unanimously dischargFea the rule. It was very questionable whether the plaintiff had any cause of action whatever ; bus it was clear that it was either for a malicious prosecution or nothin, and the CouLrt 'would be lending itself to a gross abuse and perversion of the law if, under the pretence andL colour of a plaint for money and time expended, they in any mauner countenanced a proceeding in a County Court which was not within its jurs. diction. The plaintiff chose to callhis plaint by one name, but it was, in fact another altogether, and one which could not be entertunea in the court below.

CUOURT of BANKRUPTCY, BasinghaZZ-stree4 June 11 IN RE EDWARD BALDWYIN. (Before Mr. Comrntigsioner EvANS] 'Xhe bankrupt was a printer and newspaper proprietor, of Ehoe-lane, Fleet-street. His accounts, as prepared by Messrs. Turquand and Young, extend from May 17, 1856, to February, 18, 1857, and cont-ain the following items:Dr.-Unsecured creditors, 22,3901. ; ditto, to C. Baldwin for annuity, 17,6771. ; creditors partially secuired, 38,6471. - Iabilities, 3,7521.

This was the examination meeting, Mr. Barker, for the assignees, and Mr. Lawrance, for the bankrupt, concurred in tue desirability of an adjournment, to allow time to examine the accounts, and an adjournment was ordered to Tuesday, the 30th of June, at 1L IN RE BRAO,GIOTTE AND TESTA. The bankrupts were merchants, of Lombard-street. Mr. LINeKLATER, on their behalf, applied for certificates. Mr. LAWRANCLE, for the assignees, did not oppose,'and certificates of the second class were granted. (Before Mr. Commnissioner GOULuuRN .) IN RE G. C. FRANGsIADI. This was an adjourned certificate meeting in the case of the above bankrupt, a merchant of London and Liverpool Affidavits were filed in support of an immediate judgment; also in oprosition. The latter set forth that Mr. Lizard, banker of Tokenhouse-yard, had purchased the bankrupt's draughts for 2,2001. upon Messrs. Zinziani. These bills were unaccepted, but Mr. Lizard was led to be. heve thiat they would be accepted on presentation. Aceeptanco was afterwards refused on the ground that the bankrupt was a debtor to Messrs. Zinziani. The CoMMIrsSSIoNER inquired whether there was any rea. son why the bankrupt's conduot could not be inquired into as well now as at a future period. Mr. AIL ABRAHAMS (for Mr. Lizard).-We have reason to believe that we are on the track of goods-goods that have boen concealed. Mr. LAWRANCE, for the bankrupt, said the Counrt had the bankrupt's affidavit that at the time the bills were dis. counted by Mr. Lizard he (the bankrupt) had the authority of Messrs. Zinziani for stating that they would accept the bills. The bankrupt had passed his examination. The bankrupt denied the concealment of property, and the Court would not act on a mere suggestion for which there was not the slightest pretence. His HoNOthIt said that, without for one moment intending to convey any imputation upon the bankrupt, whose eonduct appeared to him, as also to the assignees, clear of blaUficate sthouddjouOrfn thle hearing of the application for cerifiateto he -8t o Jily.Evey cediorhad a right to put forward his views. The bankrupt with two others Lhd been the members of three firms, and a reasonable time must be allowed to creditors for inquiry. Some discussion arose respecting a right of proof against the three estates, Mr. Peaechy appearing for the assigneesa.i6 His Hoc)ouR said it did not appar very maaterial ogstn vhich of the three estates pr.oof should be preferred, as each estate would probably pay nearly the same amount of dividend-abont 2s. 6d. in the pound. The House of Lords would shortly deliver a judgment which must affect the judgment of this Court. He would therefore adjourm the case until that judgment had been given, unless the creditor should in the meantime elect against which estate he would prove his debt.
INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, June 11, I, 1It THOMAS TrTTCI (Before t7w CniEF CoNImmssIo,-m) This insolvent, a cab proprietor, was opposed by Mr. SAnRooD for a creditor named Hill, to whom he had given a bill of exchange in payment for three horses. The bill, which proved to be an accommodation transaction, was dis. hononred, tho horses were sold, and the insolvent now soughtto be discharged. The CITIESF COMNITSSIONER was of opinion that the debt bad been contracted writhout reasonable expectation of pay. mnert, for which reason the disoharge would be delayed until the expiration of eight calendar months from the vesting order.
POLICE. Bo0wsTREFT.-A man named John Bran was charged by Captain Valentine Baker, of the 10th Hussars, with defrauding him of one shilliUng by passing off an old Ascot race card for one of this year. Captain Baker stated that he was going to Ascot races that morning, and as he was driving over Waterloo-bridge -to the Waterloo.station the prisoner came to the carriage and offered some cards for sale. He bought one for a ashilling and drove on, but discovered in a few minutes that he had been imposed upon. It was one of last year's cards, the date havlng been ingeniously altered. He left his carriage and went back to look for the prisoner, who, the mnoment he saw witness coming, took to his heels. Witness followed and overtook him and gave him into -custody. The policeman found on him a number of similar cards with the date altered in the samne way. The prisoner.-I was not aware but what they was all light, ir. I did not know they was last year's cards. Mtr. JARDINE.-It is a scandalous frauad, and I dare say you thought yoL could do it with impunity, as people who are in a, h urry to get away by the train to see the races are Rot likely to find it out till they get into the railway carr1age, or, if they do,they don't like to lose time coming back Zbout it. Captain Baker said,there was another gentleman who had been cheated in the samo way, but hadid not give his name. Mr. JA.KDIiNE was afraid he was not likely to come forward. However, the prisoner must be remanded for a few days, to give an opportunity for bringing forward any further charge against him. MARLflOROUGH-STREET.-William PuUen was brought before Mr. BizqGIArA, charged with throwing a quantity of vitriol over the dresses of two young women. Sarah Tucker, waitress at 52, aowland-street, a coffeehouse, stated that on Tuesday afternoon the prisoner came into the kitchen, and, after making a surly remark, went behind her and threw something on her gown. The next morning she found that her dresswas bDurnt into holes. Margaret Bailey lived as servant in the Same house. On Tuesday night she found a gown, which was hanging up in her bedroom, burnt with vitrioL When she got up tho next morning she found a frock and another gown burnt with vitriol. The damage done amounted to between 41. and 5. Heard her master ask the prisoner why he threw the vitriol over the girls' dresses, to vhich the prisoner mnswered that he wanted to do them some mischief. Henry Fatt, servant to Mr. Gilbert, oilman, Tottenhain=ourt-road, proved that on Taesday the prisoner bought a pennyworth of vltriol; and on being told there was water _n it had it changed for the strongest sort. TOShei pLrisner denied the charge, and was fully committed WonsmP-sTBEEr.-Jchn EUlis and Daniel Hagarty, two young men about 20, were charged beore hlr. fl'yzw4eir with the following robbery. At a quarter past 4 on Wednesday afternoon a lond knock wazs gIven at the door of a geatleman tnaued Gooch, r^ssdinv ~n Snrublaud-road, Dalston, and on its being answered bv ite housemaid she foaud there the prioner EXaaty, who ,..iid he had come from Mfr. Davis, ad handed her this ,note:-" Sir, be kind enough to tell the -beasar when it will bo e nuvenient to you to let me reud a mLs4 to tune your picee,ofrte. I would have sent before, but have been too busy, asd hopce you will excuse it." This was signed "Ceorf J)avis," aud directed from Great CharIl street, Bmackfriars.xoad. The girl took the no'e to her nilst.ress In the kitchsn,'who sa;d it must be a mistake, and went pp to explain that Mt was so; but on both getting to the de~or they found the ~ncsseag9r had left, thoug4he ih.d aid h~e would wait forall answfes,- .3r. Gooeh came h9tF shortly a~fter, and hi. wifv a1ed him 'bou.t tho tuig ' m'blzy dear," said ho, " this is a planned thing Ã¯Â¿Â½gr a robbery; you had better look about the plaoe ;" and-on the mistress and girl so doing two coats and a cloak vwre found to have been .tolen. Exactly an hour after this Sergeant Crisp, of the N division, was on duty in the Mnigseland-road, when the two prisoners passed him close to the Canal-bridge. Ile had no particular reason for doing so, but he thought Ellis looked stouter than he naturally would do, and therefore stopped him and unbuttoned his coat, a liberty the prisoner resented. This operation of unbattoning, however, he had to perform three times, the prisoner being encased in as many coats. " Why," said Crisp, " it's rather warm for three coats, i-n't it ? " " Well, it i," said Ellis, "rather, but I have bought them of a man cheap, and thought I might as well put them on for convenience." The prisoner, however, neither knew the seller nor where he lived, and was therefore transferred to the station, to which also shortly after was Hagarty brought, he having been pursued and captured by another officer, together with the cloak, which had been flung into an empty house in Mayfield-streetk some distance from Shrubland-road, and on searching Ellis another of Mr. Davis's pianoforte letters was found upon him, in exactly the same words and writing as that delivered by Hagarty. Inspector Langdon said these robberies were becoming somewhat serious, as this was the sixth committed in his district of Kingsland within a fortnight, and all by means of fictitious letters similar to those produced. Neither prisoner had a word to say, and they were both fully committed for trial. THAMIMs-Bartholomew Norton, a tall man about 30 years of age, was charged with violently assaulting his wife, Eliza Norton, an attenuated care-worn looking woman, who presented herself with marks of brutal violence on her fiace and with one of her eyes closed. Mr. SELFE sentenced the prisoner to three months' imprisonnent with hard labour. SOUTNVARI.-George Woodley was charged with assaulting his wife, Sarah Woodley. A gentleman residing in the TAanbeth-road said, he was passing the end of Union-street, Borough-road, about 12 o'clock that day, when he saw the prisoner running after the woman, making violent blows at her. In doing so he fell down, but caught hold of the woman's legs and pulled himself up. He then knocked her down and kicked her two or three tames. Witness called out for the police to interfere, and immediately Bell, 33 MI, came up with other offlicers and secured the prisoner. Witness never saw a more brutal attack on a woman in his life. Coleman, 153 MI, said, he also saw the prisoner kick her. Witness knew him to be a notorious thief, and beheved him to be a ticket-of-leave man. Mr. ComBZa said that all he had to do with was the assault. That was proved beyond all doubt, and he should sentence the prisoner to six months' hard labour at Wandsworth. LAMIBT.-M.r. Richard Mathews, formerly an omnibu, proprietor at Norwood, but latterly a carman at that nlaceattended in discharge of his recognizances for final exsLina tion, on a charge of stealing a truss of straw, the property oz the London General Omnibus Company. After hearing further evidence, Mr.ELLIOT said, he did not think the company's property in the straw was sufficiently shown, and therefore discharged the accused.

A numerously-attended meeting was held at the Towahall, Woolwich, yesterday evening, Mr. George HaU Graham in the chair, for the purpose of passing a resolution to be presented to Government expressive of their opinion that, as the Govermment establishments at Woolwich occupy a major portion of the area constituting the township, the Government property should be taxed in a slmilar ratio to that of private persons. Mr. John Townsend, M.P. for Greenwich, Dr. Carlisle, Mr. Jolly, Mr. Tuffield, and a number of othergentlemen, addressed the meetingin favour of the proposition, and the resolution was carried unani. mously. It was also agreed that a petition should be presented to the House by M1r. Townsend, embodying a resolntion' to the effect that the remuneration given to the labourers employed in Her Majesty's dockyards and Royal arsenals-namely, 12s. 6d. per veek-is insufficient to support themselves and their families, and suggesting that heir pay should beincreased to 16s. per week. After some remarks from the chairman, illustrating numerous instances of widows and orphans of men employed by Her Majesty's Government having, through casualties, become burdens on the ratepayers of Woolwich, and demonstrating the propriety of petitioning Government as extensive occupiers of property (whicb, if in the hands of Her Majesty's subjects, would pay a taxation for the relief of the poor of upwards of 7,0004. per annum) to bear a proportionate share in the taxation of the parish, the assembly separated.

EXTRAORDI ARY SxiGICAL OPERATImN.-A surgical operation of such rare delicacy, coolness, and skill as the one we are about to record, and which has probably not been surpassed in the annals of surgery, was performed in this city (SanFrancisco) on Saturday last,thellthinst. The factsof the case are asfollows:-About two months anda half ago a Mr. Beal, of 1'uolumne county, had the breech-pin of a fowling-piece blown into his body while endeavoursng to discharge the gun, which was rusty and overloaded. The breech-pin entered under the left arm, breaking a rib in its prog, and finally rested in the cavity of the chest beneath the heart, where it remained during the time mentioned, producing effusion and purulent secretion, until the cavity of the chest was perfectly engorged. He bad been treated for the wound, but with little or no relief, as the piece of metal still remained in his body, although it had been vainly searched for. In an almost dying state, his frame attenuated and weakened, Mr. Beal was brought to San Francisco for treatment; but with scarcely a hope of recovery. But being of the most determined cbaracter he readily consented to suffer an operation, although informed that it would probably cause his death before the operation could be completed. Accordingly, his surgical attendant commenced by making an incision through the fleshy parts under the left arm, down the ribs, midway between the spine and the breast bone, for the distance of four inches and a-half. A transverse incision was then made, three inches long, commencing near the centre of the former, and directly towards the breast bone. Portions of the entire sixth and seventh true ribs were removed with the saw, and subsequently part of the firat false rib, when it was expected the metallic substanoe in the caTity of the chest would be readily discovered. This hope, however, proved deltsive, as the probe Was tried in vain to its full length, about five inches. 'The external 'wound was 'then enlarged so as to admit the finge-s, in the hope of ascertaining by the tense of tonch some sinus or opening leading to the metallic body, through which an instrument could be passed to ascertain its location. The most patient and careful exploration failed to reveal anrthing, although the fingers were repeatedly passed about the heart in every direction. As a de,-isi,- ressor, a steel sound, nearly 14 inches in length, was introduced to the depth of about lt inches, and the cavity of the chest cautiously, but t,horou y explored, until the locality of the metl was ascertained beneath the heart. It was most difficult to determine whether the foreign substance was really found, as the action of the heart constantly imparted motion to the instrument, which necessarily embarrassed the debcate exercise of the sense of touch, and the metal wGs so enveloped in the deposit of matter, or so covered up by the membranes, that the sensation conveyed through the souni was more like that made when coming in contact with the bones than a foreign ad metallic body, and required tho exercise of a remarkable degree of coolness, patience, and courage. The breech-pin was finally seized and extra-ted. and the patient is now doing well, far beyond what could possibly have been expected under the circumstances, and is most likely to recover. This magnificent operation, which occupied one hour and a quarter in its performance, was the work of Dr. E. S. Cooper, assisted by Drs. A. B. Sheldon, Webster, and others. It is most worthy of remark that Mr. Beal suffered the whole of this wonderful, dangerous, and tryin'g operation without the use of chloroform or ether; but-frnily setting his teeth endured the insufferable agony for the space of one hour and a quarter. Somietimes hle w3uld 'say,_ "Doctor, I can stand this no longer," when a small quantity of brandy was'administered to keep him up, but otherwise he never gave a groan tha'i cotld be heard across the roomi in which he lay. We certainly consider this the moet wonderful surgical operation ever performed in this country, and ehallenge a parallel elsewhere. W-e' h'ne'take'n much pains to give this account at length for the udvaneement of the surgical art.-Califord4ianPAmer of April 17.

UNIVERSITY INTBLLIGEVCE. _ -- OXFORD, JuNE 1L 'ine aOJOUrned debate on the Pablic Examination Statute was resumed this day at 2 o'clock. Tho Vice-Chancellor presided. Mr. Maskelyne, of Wadham, who had moved the adjournment, opened the debate by regretting the absence of the Reader in Experimental Philosophy. wihose place he would very imperfectly saupply, and who (he knew) had in. tended to propose amendments on the points to which he was about to direct attention. He alluded to the compul. sery attendance on professors' lecturea. Under present regnlations this attendance was nugatory, and was a mere tnb thrown to the whale of popular opinion. He would tither leave the attendance free or make it a reality. This would beat be done by requiring the professors to examine their pupils before giving certificates. He objected, also, ti the special requirement made by the statute of one course at least of mathematical or physical science. Thoso stndies did not need protection, and might be left to their I intrinsic merits. He would propose as an amendment that either tho clause requiring attenance oanprofessors' lectures should be omitted, or something added to make the certificate a reality. Mr. Tweed, of Exeter, thought it would be a real saving of time if the present statute were withdrawn, and in lieu of it a smaller change proposed, either by decree of Convocation, or, if that were thought unconstitutional, by a fresh short etatute, The change which he would suggest was,-L That all who obtained a first, second, or i hird claes in the Classical School should be excused from a second schooL 2. That all candidates for honours in a cecond school might be allowed, instead of passing two classica examinations, to pass a single examination ccordizg to the old system, before the Moderators. The consent of the coLege should be required in this last case, to secare that the persons applying were bond Jide candidates for honours in a second school, and the exAmination should be passed, at latest, in the 12th Term. This plan would, of course, be only temporary. It would be tentative, and during the time that it vras being tried a permanent raeasure might be elaborated. Mr. Adams, of New College, had an a'nendmenttopropose. The difficulty was to work harmoniously the old and the new studies. Assuming that the present requirement of two schools was too much-a point on 'which he bad no opinion himself, but which seemed to be generally conceded -the question was, how to encourage sufficiently the new subjects without discouraging classics. He thought we only wanted to give encouragement to the new studies where persons had a decided turn for them. He should vish, therefore, that such persons as showed a special aptitude for them should be excused from the classical schooL Thlis aptitude might be tested by a previous voluntary eXaminatiOn. He handed i an amendment The VicePrincipal of St. Mary's Hall (Mr. Cbase) thought the whole movement premature. We had only recently established a new system, and had'only experienced the difficulties to be expected in the early working of any new system. It was too soon to make another change. Above al he should deprecate such temporary experiments as those suggested by Mr. Tweed. He agreed with Mr. Michell that the statute, a3 it had been brought forward, should be pressed to a vote with all speed. With respect to the private tutor clause, he thought it was not sufficient to disallow such persons from taking part in the vir4 roce examination of their pupils. He thought neither coUlego nor private tutors should examine their own pupils at all. The cause of the whole difficulty was the insufficient payment of the examiners. They should occupy a more permanent position, and be paid handsomely, and required to give up tuition altogether. Dr. Tristram, of Lincoin, wished to propose an amendment, allowing candidates for honours in the classical schools to obtain honours in a second school as late as their 20th term. Professor Conington agreed with all that had fallen from Mr. Maskelyne. He wished that clause 2 had been more considered, as there were real practical inconveniences of a serious kind connected with it. In the matter of attendance on professorP' lectures tither more should be done, or less. Professors were required to give certificates only to those who were " attentive" to their lectures; but how were they to test this ? Were they to examine? If so, it should be stat explicitly. At present it was really impossible to know what Es wished. Again, with respect to reasonable causes of excuse for absence, how was the professor to know the tiuth of an alleged cause? He had no personal acquaintaLce with his pupils. The only satisfactory test would be the signature of his college tutor, but this could acarcely be eemanded unless it was expressed so in the statute. He I oped the clause would be withdrawn and re-modelled. ' he Public Orator (Mr. Michell) rose to explain in reply to Professor Conington. He admitted the diffieulties, but did rot regard them as peculiar to professors. The clause had zeceived careful consideration, and had been altered and realtered in consequence of a memorial from the professors. 9e was sorry the objections had been raised too late. ProfFssor Donkin merely rose, as connectedwith mathematicil science, to express his entire agreement with Mr. Maskelyne. He wanted no statutable protection for his subject. No other memberrising to addres the House, the Vice-Chancelor declared the discussion closed at 10 minutes past 3 O'clock. In our account of the proceedings of yesterday we accidentally omitted to state that the first speaker was Mr. Freeman, of Trinity, who opposed the present arrangement of the Mloder Iistory School, and handed in a long amendment, which he read, suggesting for it an entirely difterent scheme. Mfr. Rawhnson, of Exeter, also handed in two short amendments. CAMBRIDGE, JuiNE 11. At a Congregation held this day the Rev.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I observed in your impression of to-day that the anniversary feast at Cuddesdon ws, by somne mistake, described under the head of "University Intelligence." This is, I think, calculated to mislead your readers upon a } olnt of some importance to us. The University of Oxford has never in any way identified itself with a college which the bishop of a diocess within which our University is not included has seen fit to estabhsh in olr neighbourhood.

MIDDCI,-AsS EDucAnIoN.-ACtive efforts have been for some time mak!ng in the west of England to promote middle-class education. Viscoutn Ebrington led the way two years ago, by offering annual prizes to farmer's sons who were found most proficient in the English Ian guage and literature, the history of the British Empire, and geography, and practical mathematics. During the past few months Mr. Thomas Dyke Acland, the eldest son of Sir T. D. Acland, has orginated a more comprehensive scheme for the education of boys, "with the view to employiment in agriculture, arts, manufactures, and commerce," in the counties of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. Prizes wil be offered for competition in several useful branches of learning, and so much success has attended the scheme proxnoted by Mr. Acland and his zealous coadjutors, that the Privy Council have intimated their intention of instructing two of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools connected witb the district to give their aid to the scheme by assisting in the examination of the competitors. The Bath and West of England Agricultural Society have resolved to place at the usposal of the committee (which consists of several noblemen ad genUemen of great influence in the west of England) an honorary life membership of the society, to be competed for as a prize; and at the annual meeting, held a few days ago, 'Lord Courtenay, the president, in aUuding to the subject, said -" I take leave to allude to a movement with whicL the society has connected itself, having for its object the promotion of middleclass education. Tfie scheme set on foot operates through the medium of examinations into the education given in schools in which. agriculturists are specially interested. You wiU remember that my valued and talented friend and relation, Lord Ebrington, with that enlightened philanthropy which characterizes his public conduct, two years ago placed at the disposal of the public a prize out of his own funds for competition in the school education of this district. The plan answered well, and resulted in the attainment of a prize by the deserving son of a farmer at no great distance from Exeter. A committee met at Exeter, and resolved upen an extension of the plan,which I heartily hope may continue to answer. This plan of promoting Education through the aid of local committees, assisted by the inspectors of the committee of Privy Council, contemjiates no interference with the independence of the conductor of agncultaral schools. It contemplates no inquisii orial investigation into the wayin which a school may be managed. Such a plan would he unworthy of ita promoters, nd would defeat Its own object. But it contemplates such a system of examinations, as by showing to the world who Ere the most inteligent, the best instracted, and the best tsained boys in a particular district, will show also who are the masters best fitted to train those boys.

THE SLAVE TRADE. A deputation of gentlemen oonneoted with the West India interest, headed by Lord Shaflesbury, had an inter. view with Lord Palmerston on Wednesday, for the purposo of calling his attention to various circumstances tending to show the increase of sbvery, and to make suggestions calculated to suppress the traffli. The gentlemen who formed the deputation were Mr. S. W. Taylor, ALP., Mr. Thomson Hankey, ALP., and Messra. John Cater, L. .L Valpy, Stephen Cave, W. Mackeson, and W. D. Child. bh poiatsressed uponLordPalmerston'a attention were te violationhy Spain o' the treatieswwith GreatBritain,the increse ia the trade in Cuba, especially durng the last three years, the further impetus to be dreaed from the high price of sugar, the depressing influence on the prospects of fzee labour, the senous obstruction to the progress of the negro population, the necessity for negro labour on the plantations, and for the influx of such labour in almost all the West India islands, and, as a ooosequenoe, the supply of slave labour to meet such demand, unless free labour of the same quality is provided. Lord SHA-rMBURY, in introducing the deputation, referred to the document which had been previously subnitted to Lord Palmerston as oontaining an epitome of the views of the deputation, and of the evidence on which sach views were based, and proceeded to touch upon the indisputable evidence which unfortunately now existed of the IDDgrant violation of ths treaty obligations on the part of the Spanish Government in aU its departments, leadirng to the encouragement of the nefarious traffic in huLnan beings. He further observed that the trade was undoubtedly on the increase, and that there seemed to be a preponderating weight of authority in favour of the pLn of c osely watching tbe Cuban coast, for which service, as he was informed, the despatch gunboats were specally dapted. While he trusted that Her Majesty's Government would favourably receive the suggestion to. be offered on that occaion for in. creasing the efficienoy of the cruising system, he felt that there was much truth in the next proposition to be submitted-namely, the removal of the mixed commisson court from Hiavannab to Jamaica All our experience had taught us that there wvas much difficulty in securing the efficient oreration of such machinery in a slave country, and the more active our British officials became the more were they opposed, and their lives were even in jeopardy. The fat ot the actual slavery of those unfor. tunate beings who, from their title to freedom, were styled " emancipados " also called loudly on the British nation to insist on the removal of those negroes taken from captu-red slave ships to a country where slavery was unknova, and the Spamsh Government were in express terms bound by the treaty to agree upon other means better adapted to secure the eo0mplete attainment of the object proposed. Certain suggestions would als be brou&ht before his Lord. ship for further consideration, having iu view not only the suppression of the slave trade, but of slavery itself, through emigration treaties for substituting the free African for the slave. Having stated thus far the general views ot those with whom he Was associated, Lord Shaftesbury intimated that a few gentlemen would enlarge somewhat on each point Mr. JOEEN WMTR CATER submitted a map of the Iland of Cuba, and pointed out the usual course of slavers and thoseportions of the coast on whichslaveswere landed. He then suggested the stations on which the despatch gunboats should cruise, inconnexion with two or more larger veseelg. His experience enabled him to express a decided opinion that the class of vessels he had specified would be in every resFect suited for the work, and could be so fitted as to affold every prespect of health to the crews. Mr. LEONARD RowE VAXPY expressed bis own regret, that he found himself the substitute of Captain Hancock RN., as that officer was unable to attend, though cordially concurring in the work they had in hand. Mr. Valpy sub. mitted a sketch, showing the relative positions of the islands of St. Domingo, Cuba, and Jamaica, and the course of vessels sailing from the north side of St. Domingo to the north or south coast of Cuba. It was the opinion of Cap. tain Hancock, after several years experienoe in command of a cruiser, that most of the slavers ran along the north coast of St. Domingo, and that it would be advisable in the first instance to nave a close cordon stretched from Crooked Island Passage on the north bearing south to the north-east of Jamaica, so as to cut off that passage. In other respects the views of Captain Hanwcck, in a peculiarly striking manner, confirmed those submitted by Mr. Cater, and his testimony was specially strong in favour of the class of vessels proposed to be used. Mr. bvxruxN CAVE then urged the necessity for the removal of the mixed commission courts, enforcing by i clear statement of facts the general views expressed by the noble earl whoheadedthedeputation. Mr. W ILAAn WYLLYSS m.cIEsox submitted that savery could only be rooted out by African emigration treaties. He knew the objections which would be started, bat onreflection they would,.a found to be groundless. The plantations must and would be cultivated, and although it had been said by a high authority (Lord Palmnerston) that the planters were slaveowrnera at heart, he submitted that they were only slaveowners in fact because there was no other available source of lbour. The expense of the sLave was enormous, and if free African lAbour was supplied the resent slaveowner might become a rnmisionary at heart. smch a plan must be universal, for if restricted to the British colonies we should be charged with self-interested motives. If France were not joined she would import the free -black herself, and to Spain and Portugal we must show the advantages to be thus obtained. But he admitted that emigration must be accompanied by emancipation, as free men must not be landed in a slave country,lest,like the emancipados, they became slaves. Such an emigration should be regulated by a mixed commission in Africa, and the syS. tom would be founded on voluntary contracts, free paEsage, and outfit, with return passages or grants of land to the settler. By means of the colonization of the West Indies with free blacks the civilization of Africa might be dvanoed -emigration and missionary boards would work together. In addition to these statements a memorial had been submitted to Lord Palmerston, proving the violation of the treaty which came into operation in the year 1820, and forming the basis of the suggestions made for the abolition of slavery. Reference was made to an article in The Tines of May last, which said, " If we are to believe the general evidence of the world, the slave trade goes on as vigorously as ever." The AZew York Journaz of Corntr,lcce in 1856 said, "Within 12 months not less than 15 slavers had been fitted out and despatcbed to the west of Africa from New York alone, and a commander of a slaver who was imprisoned in that city decared that, in his opinion, there were in one year as many as 35." According to the evidence of an interpreter on board a slaver taken into Jamaic3 two vessels departed weekly with from 500 to 700 slaves on beard. Another statement in The Times was then referred to in the memorial, to the effect that accounts from the Havannah to the 9th of May stated that the slave trade was flourishing. A British ship had landed 600 Africans at the Sagua la Grande, and was then burnt to the water's edge. There were a dozen vessels in the port of Havannah for sale as slavers. The course of action suggested for the abolition of slavery comprises the following points:-Strong and energetic representations to the Spanish Government. Great stress is laid upon the expediency of stationing despatch gunboals on the coast of Cuba, which plan it is remarked is strongly advocated by Admiral Sir G. Pecbell and by Captain Han. cock, R.N. It is then mentioned that the opinions of those resident in Spain were forcibly expressed by the correspondent of The Times who, writing so late as the 1st of June, 1857, says, " If it is really desired to stop the slave trade, now so active in Cuba, letasufficientforce of gunboats be sent out to stand sentryover CuLban ports, aud keep a bright look out about the nooks and creekss in which slavers would be likely to ron what portion of their wretched cargo the horrors of the middle passage may leave alive." With resPect to the successful operation of these screw deepatch gunboats, it is stated on competent authority that they are likelv to be very efficient. In fact, there are now two in the ]Aast Indies, and they can be made suitable for a warm climate. According to the account given of these boats by a naval efficer their draught of water is from 11 to 12 feet. 'Under full steam they can steam a speed of 11 knots an hour. For fuU speed they require coal for about five days. but at moderate or half-speed they could carry coal for 20 days. When the fires are out, Lbout two hours are required to get Up steam, but when the fires are banked only from 10 to 20minutes are required. Reference is made in this memorial to a statement in the New York Hesrald of April last, which mentions several facts tendiDg to show the necessty of such a station on the coast of Cuba. The following are the suggestions made for abolishing slavery by African emigration treaties - " Suppreion of savery Itself, not the trade alone, thrc-gh eusigration treaties, bY Bbitltutlng the free black African fcr the nave. "Emigraion usut be universal; if restricted to British eoonles Brirtan migh be chgeid with intere3teL moirves. It France be nou joined. ebo will soon import the free black by neiLf.

With reference to the wide subject of emigration, his Lordship expressed his doubts whether the time had arrived for such treaties, and alluded to various objec. tions which might be raised. For tho present, therefore, he could not testify to his approval of the plan, His Lordship then stated that Her Mijesty's Government were most aixious to do all in their power to repress and, as far as possible, crush the slave trade. He admitted the force of much that had been srgedas tothe probable sucoegs of a squadron on the east of Cuba, ana was glad to he able to state that now theret were vessels at liberty for such ser. vice, and proposed that one or two gentlemen shoild wait on the irst Lord of the Admiralty to confer with him on the subject. His Lordship also aamitted the advantage to accrue from a-transfer of the mixed commission eourt,, and explained the position in which tho Government were placed in coniiexion with tbh treaties. He would,however, further examine intothe subject, and assured the deputation that all their suggestipns should receive full oonsideration. EttnON PETiTioNrs.-The reognizancea have been -repor&unobjectionable in the ease of the petition againstthe return for Beverley, as will -have been seen from our Parliamentar intelligence of yesterday.
