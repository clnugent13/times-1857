MONiBY-MABRBT and CITYINTBLLIGE&2fci. Saturday Evening. Late this afternoon a suspension was announczd which wiU occasion deep regret. The firm > that of Messrs. Dennistoun and Co., one of the largest connected with the Americantradein Great Britain. Their liabilities, it is feared, cannot be much short of 2,000,0001. These are spread, however, very extensively, and it may therefore be hoped wiU not fall on any particular district with such force as to cause further heavy disasters. Messrs. Dennistoun have houses in New York and New Orleans, and the almost total cessation of remittances from those points has rendered their stoppage unavoidable. The head establishment Is in Glasgow, where it has existed upwards of 70 years, and there are branches in Liverpool and London. At Melbourne, in AuistraLia, they have as correspondents Messm. Den. nistoun Brothers and Co., but happily that firm will not be compromised. The private property of the partners in real estate and other poss3ssions is known to be of great mragnitude, and it seems scarcely possible that even under the worst circumstances their embarrassmont can be more than temporary. Although anxiety has been felt 1with regard to them for several weeks pasn, tbehr honourable standing has neverforamomentbeen called in question, and there wil be on all sides a disposition to promote every arrangement that r .y be calculated to hasten Vhe possibility of a complkte resumption. Subjoined is the circular issued:-- " c". 7. "We have the painful daty of Informing you thAt e :x establishments in this country are obliged, by the it entire suspension of the usual remittancesirom ib' oed States, to ask you and their other oreditors to rJ) thne for the payment of their debts. Thiis " : arisen so reontly out of the montd:- arids in Amervo rb ; it is not In our power to ¢x- it ately what ldulgence we nay require, but whiui awaiting further advices from abroad we will pkle our books in the hands of well-known accountants in London and Glasgow with a view to prepar 3 full statements of our affairs, and we propose calling a meeting of our creditors in London on the earliest possibli day, when we hope to lay before you such a proposal as wil' meet with your approbation. Oar houses of Dennistoun, Wood, and Co. of Naw York and A. andJ. Dennistoun and Co. of New Orleans are identical with the houses in Great Britain, but the house of Dennistoun Brothers and Co. of Melbourne is a distinlc establihment. ' We are, &c., "T. and A. DIxN?sTouN, of Glasgow. "ALExAwDER DsNiSToux and Co., of LiverpooL " DENISTOU, ORoss, and Co., of London." The funds have again been very steady. They opened at an iuprovemaent of a quarter per cent., and experienced a further similar advance before the close. The first quotation of Consols was 88g t, i, and owing to investments by the public and the anticipation that favourable news from India may be received on Monday, they went to 881 to i, at which they remained. The suspension of Messrs. Dennistoun did not transpire during market hours. For the 7th of December the last price was 891 to . Bank Stock left off at 209 to 2 1; Reduced, 87j to ; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 50a. t) 40s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 23s. to 17s. discount. The applications for discount at the Bank to-day were again extremely heavy. It is believed that at the last Court a discussion took place as to whether the advance should, not be to 10 per cent. instead of 9, and it is nowv evident that it would have been advantageous to have carried the movement to that extent. In any measure that may be decided upon it Is to be hoped the old plan of waiting for the regular Court on Thursday will not be revived. Business in foreign stocks was limited to a few purchases for investment; the only speculative transactions being in Turkish, which closed at an advance of fully i per cent; Brazilian Four-and-aHalf per Cents. were negotiated at 96i; Granada New Active, 17i; Mexicwn, 18i and j ; Sardinian, 89; Turkish Six per Cents., :87 and 87i; for the account, j87k' and i; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 96k; and Datch Four per Cent. Certifi cates, 97k. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 80c. for money, and 67f. for the end of the month, showing in the former case an advance of an eighth. At Hamburg the rate of discount now stands at 9i per cent. At Vienna there is continued depression, and the premium on gold increases. According to the advices from Paris this afternoon the speculators are congratulating themselves on the absence of any further movement in the rate of discount by the Bank of France. The directors of that establishment, however, seem to know the value of this false confidence. The next bullion return is expected to show a further falling off of more than a million sterling, and, foreseeing the consequences of the fresh advance in the value of money in aU other countries, they are said to have applied to the Emperor either for a tax on the exportation of specie or permission to Increase their charge for discount to 8 per cent. The first proposition is astounding. If the tax could be levied it would be a direct impost on everymerchantwhohonestlypaid hisforeigndebts. Of course, however, it would he wholly inoperative, except to cause a multitude of people on the frontiers to abandon useful pursuits for the more profitable occupation of smuggling. Atpresent, it appears, each proposal has been negatived, and the future course of the Bank must remain a singular problem. The Niagara to-day for Boston and New York took out 120,0001., chiefly in sovereigns. The demand for gold for Scotland has apparently ceased, and some small amounts lately sent thither are said to have been returned. The plans of the gentlemen who are on their way from Glasgow to " demand" from Iord PalmerBton the repeal of the Bank Charter Act have not yet transpired, but it is to be presumed they will be definitely stated during the interview. Commercial men will not, of course, ask anything simply as a measure of relief without showing how the relief is to arise. Every one at all times wants relief from evils of some kind, but all but children know from experience they must not pray for the laws that regulate the general transactions of the world to be suspended or set at nought whenever they may happen to interfere with individual convenience. What do the merchants and millowners of Glasgow expect to get from rescinding the Bank Charter Act; and supposing they get what they expect, wvi it meet the difficulties for which it is claimed asza remedy ? These are the two questions to be decided. Do they mean to assert that the charge of 9 or even 12 percent. discount fora month or two, is morethanthey can bear? In justice to them, such an idea cannot be entertained. The diffierence beeween 5 and 9 per cent for two months is exactly 13s. 4d;, and any merchant in a condition to be embarrassed by an extra payment to that extent on all the accommodation he may require must obviously have assumed a place to which from utter want of capital he wag not entitled. Hence the suspension of the Act in order that it may lead to a reduction in the rate of discount, or at least prevent its further advance, is plainly not the thing contemplated. Yet this is absolutely the only change such a measure could produce. It would allow of an unlimited Issue of notes without reference to the outflow of the gold which those notes purport to represent, and would thus bring down the rate for accommodation at the certain prospect of an rltlmate stoppage of specie payments and the arrival of a tewhen the creditors of the merchants and miillowner*, not only of Glasgow but of aU England, would be compelled to receive paymentof their claims, not in gold as conre for but in notes, intrinsically worth perhaps 18s. instead of 20X. In other words, the creditors would be oheated for the benefit of the debtors to the extent of 10 per cent. Obviously, therefore, the Glasgow community are labouring under some delusion. Although they "1 demaud" a repeal of the act they would, we must presume for the credit of their city, join with all other honest people to denounce any risk being run of the consequences which would follow the granting of their request. The fact is, they have confounded the remedy with the disease. Their logic is at fault, but I9t t&h9ir 19tiv. Fud- Ing the general distress and a high rate of discount to be concnrrent, they hove fancied that if by some legerdemain the latter could be done away with, tae former would be relieved. They fail to see that the drain of gold is the malady and the high rate of discount the cowe, and in their ignorance they are endeavouring to persuade the country to rebel ngainst the operation, which, like all surgical processes, calls for patience and self-restraint. Their blindness is still further manifested by the fact that even if at the expense of the rest of the community a reduction of the rate of discount were effected, it would not even temporarily alleviate a single case of real misfortune. What has caused Messrs. Naylor, Vickers, and Co., and Messrs. Dennistoun to etop ? Not any difficulty in the rate of discour;t, but the simple fact that each succeeding mail from America arrived without bringing them remittances of bills to enable them to apply for discount. Their capitaLs were ample, and if they had had the bill;s the question of 9 or even 20 per cent, would not have troubled them. UJnless, therefore, it can be shown that a reduction in the Ban of England charge would cause each steamer from NTew York to bring regular remittances, the Glasgowdeputation can have no pretence to ground their proceedings on any assumption of sympathy for the sufferers from the American default. In fact, the inducement for anyone to make remittances from New York would be lessened in exact proportion to the lowness of the rate of interest on this side. These gentl.emen would, therefore, by their meddling actually out away one of the influences upon which the Ameaicau houses in England must place their beet relianee. Tle only other sufferers at present are the I'elders of produce. Sugar, coffee, saltpetre, and almost evory other article have been dliven dowu by -,pplies poured upon us from New York and e3' iYhere in the urgent necessity for money. groulu a lowering of the rate of discount stop this infltu or aggravate it? The Glasgow deputation, as practical merchants, must find it easy to give an anewer. They must know well that, in the first place, the Government have no right to attempt by arbitrary measures to raise the price of produce to consumers, who have long enough suffered from enhanced rates; and next, that even the means suggested would prove ridiculously abortive. Unless, therefore, they are prepared to reveal some theory to upset all the oli views of economical science, their journey promises to be profitless. It may serve to beget doubt and confusion in uninstructed minds, since the report of a deputation to the Prime Minister, got up expressly to disturb the public confidence in our existing laws, will of course have an effect on those who are not aware of the impulses under which such matters are concocted. The danger is that when people are in pain they listen to mischievous tempters whom they would otherwise discard. To the credit of the country, however, the movement thus far has not been among the merchants and bankers at large, but apparently fromntwo places (for iverpool is invited to join Glasgow) where banking mismanagement of the grossest kind has given a turn to the crisis which would never otherwise have been observable. It is hard at such a moment to have to utter a word with even a tinge of reproach in any direction, but if they will draw it forth the financiers of those localities must be clearly told they are not entitled by any recent circumstances to assume the lead in representing to the Government the views of the community on the monetary principles which should in this emergency regulate the course of tbe United Eingdom. The telegraphic accounts from New York received this afternoon by the Atlantic are rather less disCOUraging. The arrival of the Baltic with even the limited amount of 72,6001. in gold seems to have produced the anticipated effect, and, although the same vessel took out the announcement of the advance of the Bank rate of discount to 7 per cent., an average recovery of 2 or 3 per cent. had occurred in the stock-market. Illinois Central Bonds were quoted 67i, and the Shares 77T to 80. New York Central stood at 60g. The rate of exchange was 106-an advance of 1 per cent. The nominal premniunon specie was 4 to 1 per cent., but this was an arbitrayandanomalous quotatlon, since, ascompared with the specie circulation of other countries, the inconvertible notes of New York, owing to their scarcity, were still at a considerable premium, the banks, in their wild alarm at the consequences of their misconduct, the want of independent power on the part of the people to legislate for the emergency, and the total absence of any guiding priaciple, still urging on a contraction, although gold was beginning to pour in from al quarters. The next steamer to arrivre was the Persia, with 240,0001. The satisfactory intelligence has been received from Sheffield that the liabilities of Mesrs. Naylor, Vickers, and Co., instead of amounting to 1,000,0001., as reported in some quarters, do not exceed 450.00l. or 500,0001., and that no other firm in the district is likely to be brought down by their suspension. Some of the principal creditors are in Sweden, and the only reason for delaying tiU the 24th inst. the meeting at which a precise statement w1il be presented is in order that representatives of theae parties may be present. It Is understood that the stock of iron held by the firm in America and England is worth 270,0001., and that every debt owing to them in America is of a character on which any sound and prudent house might have implicitly relied. The blow, therefore, has been one of the most sudden that has ever fallen on any mercantile establishment, and it is believed that the entireproceedings connected with it, instead of damaging the future reputation of the partners, will add to the confidence hitherto placed in them. The railway intelligence of the week is of an unimportant chaacter. At a special meeting of the Stockton and Darlington the proposed working agreement with the South Durham and Lancashire Union was approved, and the directors were empowered either to purchase shares in that undertaking or to pay the South Durham a fixed dividend of not more than 6 per cent. per annum. The first section of the New Brunswick and Canada line, from the harbour of St. Andrew's to Barber Dam in the forest, a length of nearly 40 miles, was opened for traffic on the 1st ult. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India have receIved the sanction of the East India Company for the immediate commencement of the works on the section of the line from Bombay to Surat, making upwards of 320 miles in course of construction. The Taff Vale Company have determined upon issuing 5,000 new shares of 101. each, to provide increased accommodation for the traffic. It is proposed, also, to convert the debenture bonds into preferential stock. The works on the Spalding and Holbeach have been resumed. The Trinidad Railway have received a guarantee of 6 per cent. from the Legislative Council of the colony on aU sums expended not exceeding 300,0001., together waith a grant of a certain quantity of land per mile constructed The first section of the railway from Aleesandria, in Sardinia, towards the frontier of Parmna has been opened; this lie is intended to connect the Piedmontese system with the Central Ita3ian. TheVienna Government have authorlzed the construction of a line from Milan to the Sardinian frontier. The following information with regard to the mining business of the week is condensed from the Mining JToaurna "The unsatisfactory state of the money-market has exercised a material effect in mining matters, and from the absence of operations a general depression has ensued.

STATZ OF TBADE. ANCHESTER, Nov. 7. The demand for yarn and cloth has been on an exceedingly small scale throughout the week, and this morning few if any of those who offered goods could make sales. The result Wili be that more mills will have to be stopped in order to further contract a supply that is ranning down prices to most ruinous rates. The impression gains groand among producers " that they who work the shortest time are likely to suffer the least loss," and all who are in a positlon to act upon this principle wiU eventually be driven to it. Spinners who bought largely of cotton at its highest rate will of course be inclined to go on, but those who are without stocks are indisposed to purchase in the present state of the Liverpool market, and are either wholly or partially stopping their mills. A large mlilowner in the country districts is reported to have suspended paymuent. BIRKINGHAM, Nov. 7. Although there is an almost entire absence of American orders among the ironroasters of South Staffordshire, the trade, owing to an improved home demand, continues steady and prices are generally well supported. It was hoped the district had escaped any important losses resulting indirectly from American embarrassments, but we learn that one if not more of the largest iron firms in the neighbourhood are claimants to a very considerable amount upon the estate of Messrs. Nailer, Vicker and Co., of Liverpool and Sheffield, whose faUure was announced in The Times of yestbrday. When the Intelligence of this suspension first arrived in Birmingham it created some consternation among the members of the iron trade, and various exaggerated ramours speedily got into circulation. There is reason, however, to believe that the firms in South Staffordshire (who will be temporary ?ufferers by the suspension of Nailer and Co.) are well able to mest the difficulty and inconvenience to which they may be subjected. land that their credit is unimpaired and stands as high as ever. The deep complaint in the iron districts is with regard to the present unparalleled high price of money. The local banks have, however, it is understood, conducted their business with the greatest consideration towards their customers, and at present less inconvenience has been experienced than might have been expected. There is scarcely anything doing in the Birmingham American houses, but fortunately few of our merchants are exclusively connected with that trade. Moreover, for months past the utmost prudence has been exercised in making sahipments to the United States, and so far as the merchant trade of Birmingham was concerned at the time the American disasters occurred it may be said to have been in a perfectly healthy state. The manufacturing interests of the town and neighbourhood continue to sympathize with the depression of the commercial establishments. Few fresh orders are given out, and in many instances those which were in hand have been stopped or suspended. Slacknes in many manufactories has been the consequence; but home demands keep the o'eratlves, except in particular branches, pretty fairly em- We statted laLst week that "another" fall in the price of copper was expected. From this expression it bas been inferred that the last movement in the copper trade was a decline in quotations, whereas inAugust of the present year they rose at the rate of 41. lOs. per ton. That fact was announced in the Birmingham trade article at the time of its occurrence, When we stated that " another" faU was expected we referred not to the last rise, but to the numerous falls or fluctuations which occurred some months previously. The expressien may, however, be capable of conveying a wrong impression, and we, therefore, offer this explanation for the_purpose of removing any doubt as to our real intentions. It cannot be doubted that, although no alteration has yet been declared in the prioe of copper, the market is much easler, and that a reduction is pretty generally auticipated by the manufacturers of brass and copper goods. The late reductions in the quotations of n(14 per ton in the short space of eight or ten days) continue to unsettle the manufacture of tin wares. Uncertainty as to prices produces injurious effects, and the probability of a further decllne disinclines the manufacturers to buy for more than immediate use. The result is a limitation of work to present demand, and considerable confusion created by the repeated alteration made in discounts. There is little to add to our late statements with regard to the ironfoundries of the neighbourhood. According to the reports of trafiic managers onthe railways and canals of the neighbourhood there is an increase of tonnage, which shows the elasticity of the varied manufacturing trades of the district under circumstances of general commercial depression. At Redditch, however, the needle trade i3 not brisk, and at EiddermLnster the handloom weavers complain of slackness NOTTINGEAM, Nov. 7. The lace trade continues greatly depressed. Very little has been doing this week, and another,fnilure connected with the lae buiness has taken place; only, however, to the amount of 3,0001. The intelligence from America is still discouraging, and there is very little demand for the home-market; the high rate of discount adopted by the Bank of England presses heavily upon the Nottingham trade. In spite of this depression material is selling at high In hosiery no improvement can be noted, nearly all branches being in a state of great inactivity, w ithout the least prospect of ant speedy change for the better. BHosiery material IS about the same as last week. LEICESTER, Nov. 7 The hosiery trade is very quiet, and as buyers now only purchase for their immediate requirements manufacturers are producing accordingly, and for the most part working to order. Yarns are less firm, and were spinners to push sales less money must be taken; the worated mills are working short time. There is not mcoh doing in wool, the market being exceedingly quiet. The current of trade runs rather sluggish here, but not so disastrously as in the cottorn and worsted istricts. Both manufacturers and merchants are bearing UD manfully against the commercial and monetary pressure of the times; and, while some are not sanguine enough to beleve that the worst is passed, a more hopeful opinion generally prevails in this town and district. The losses in a few of the woollen houses by the failares in the United States will be a little heavier than lately estimated, but up to the present time they have caused no suspension or stoppage of any firm in this locality. There is no over confidence in the mercantile community as to either the present real position or the fature prospect of the great stapIa manufacture of this district; but there is a strong desre to look upon commercial and monetary affAirs in a cheerfal manner, Whie trade is carried on with becoming caution there is no undue pressure to enforce either sales or payments., and rumouts or whisperings about this or that firm are greatly discountenanced. As a trade circular by the wooUen houses here is a thing almost utterly uknlwn, the published opion of a known firm cannot (as is common with the Manchester houses) be quoted. In the absence of such the following Is copied from the Le4r InteUigencer of thts day:- We can report vary little imDrorement in tho otte of trade.

It is fortunate that from the pt?ent character of the operations throughout the sear the trade lies ta niall compass. and meranta aunfacturers hold their affairs well in hand: the outstandinx ltablities were, perhaps, never no saU l as this moment, and the exporting houss are mainaly conornenoin the present cris." The advance in the rate ol discount by the Bank of England has had no material effect here. It has certainly teuded to induce greater caution among traders, but it has scarcely at all operated in the settlement of accounts. The news from America is looked for with natural but not over. strained anxiety, and, If even the next advices be of a gloomy character, they will not give much surpris3. Everything In America, as has been said, is of a gigantic cha. racteor, but everything has Its limits; and although the present monetary panic iu the Unitd iStates may be gigantic, it must have an end, Till that end hos been reachd, ad comercil conidene hasbeenrestoredl to something like a normali sCtate,i asU ahmtte bof corsesoure shipments of manufactured goods to that country wvill be Qompswatvely email. The markets iln thy ylgtli balls tQ-day have been, as the preceding remarks would lead the reader to infer, of a very quiet character. There was a fair attendance of merchants, but they were lookers-on rather than buyers, and a very small quantity of cloth was sold. HALIFAX, Nov. 7. The worsted trade continues du]L Short.time working is extending. Prices of wool, yarns, and piece goods are a}1 rather lower; but few sales in any department have beent made this week. BRADFORD, Nov. 7. In the Bradford miarket this week business has contiauad remarkably quiet. All parties engaged in the worsted trade seem to have arrived at the conclusion that the wisest policy in the present state of mercantile pressure is to contract n engagements beyond what are necessary to supplyimmediAte wants, and hence, comparatively speaking, the week maz' be said to have been almoet a blank. There were some llnistoJ transactions in wools at the beginning of the week at rregular rates. In the marlket on Monday the pee of ,incolnebire parcels of wethers ranged from 17d. to l and hogs from 19d. to 2Otd., according to the description of w091 and the desire of holders to selL. Wools may now be quoted from 2.d. to 3d. per lb. lower, aS compare with the lat extreme rates. These prices, however, can hardly be considered a correct index to the state of the market for the rawmaterial in the absence of demand, and seeing also that they are governed to a considerable extent by special circum. stances. Nolls and brokes may be bought for less monebut there is no inquiry for these descriptinus of wooL i; yarns the busines done in the market this week has been next to nothing. Very few goods have changed hands, anc these have been bought only to satisfy requirements of an Jmmediate and pzesdng nature. The yarn export trade toGerman,y and France, and the goods export trade to Ameria. rar both in a state of suspendon. Merchants withhold their orders and refran altogether from purchaslnt goods; consequently manufacturers are working up theS stocks, both of wools and cotton warps, and will not renes them until the clouds which now darken the commeroiaj atmosphere have been dissipated and brighter proepect5 dawn. Meanwhile short-time working, which vas never more general in this district than at present, will continue to be e order of the day. It isregarded as one of the bot defensive messures for the capitalist and for the workpeople also in the long run, but the latter wil undoubtedly auber great privations. The increase in the Bank rate of discount to 9 per cent. was anticipated in Bradford. from the unfavourable advices received from London a few hours before the fact of the increase became known. The general opinion here seems to, he that the prompt action of the Bank directors wll tendl very much to hasten the restoration of the commercial equl. librium, though the effects of the unprecedented tightnessoE the rmoney market will he very severely felt in the Interval, arising from the complete chock which has boen given tocomrnmercial and manufacturing operations. The unfavour. able nature of the American advices received by the Vander. hilt have had the effect of diminiehing the hope of matters righting themselves as speedily as was expected, and the most sanguine persons are now beginning to think that business wvll be Eeriously Interrupted throughout thes winter. In regard to the monetary pressure a partial belief is entertained that the Bank rate of dis. count will be raised still higher, and since the last turn of the screw the propriety of asking the Govern. ment to relieve by an order in Council the Bank of England, fro the restrictions imposed by the Act of 1844 on it' issues (as was done during the panic of 1847), has been the subject of conversation among merchants and maYnufacturers attending the Bradford market, but no active steps have yet been taken by them in that direction, Still, notwithstanding the prospects of trade are so very unpropitious at present, confidence ls upon the whole well maintained in this district; and it is hoped that, from the lowness of stocks, the keeping down of production to the lowest point, and the caution and prudence that have been exercised on every hand, the Bradford trade will tide over the present difficulties and pass through the ordeal, if not altogether scatheless, at al events with as little injury as any other branch of trade in the kingdom. The observations contained in the city article of 21% Timea of Wednesday, and which were copied into all the prindpal local journals, on the subject of fictitious bill-drawers and the banks that encourage them, and on the need of some improvement in the bankruptcy laws, were read with much satisfaction in Bradford; and strong hop are entertained ,on the part of all the subtantial men of business here that the question will now be taken up by the Legislature, with a vewto thepassing of awmeasure which wil check the lax sys,em of commercial morality that often shields itself from exposure and punishment by reason of the defects in the existent lavi6. NORWICH, Nov. 7, The monthly circular of the London, Norwich, ancl Northampton Boot end Shoe Company states that the trade during the month of October has been much more quiet than usual for this season of the year. This is accounted for by the want of advices and remittances from Australia, the extraordinary caution of manufacturers and buyers, the great rise in prces, the high value of money, and the increasing difficulty experienced in discounting the long. dated paper by which all the larger transactions in the shoe trade are by custom provided for. Hop6 are expressed that the Australian mail now due maybe productive of a better state of things, and Cally give some support to the Northaumpton trade, which at present greatly needs it, This city (Norwich) has, however, stlll continue to exhibit considerable activity, and It is stated that new masters are establihing themselves and tempting workmen from other warehouses by the offer of higher wages. A further advance is consequently expected in the price of women's goods. The manufacturing trade has shown a liUtle more actiity during the last few days. Matters are, however, on the whole rather dull.

The fancy drill trade continues active, and will in aU pro. bability continue so, as there are a good many orders on hand. The bleaching business is brisk, considerable quan. ttlhes of goods being sent from Ireland and Scotland into this district to finish.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENO.R SAMRTRTF. A n nIrcV The Teport of the directors of this company states that the reeeipts for the last half-year amounted to 28,0001., showing a deficiency, as compared with the corresponding half-year ofE1856, of about 2,6601. The expenses amounted during the same period to 19,9761., against 19,5371., belng an excess of about 4401., aud leaving a profit of 8,021., in addition to the sum to he received f*om the Government on account of guarantee and other sums to meet the fixed charges of the company, and by which it will be absorbed. The directors bave considered it as their duty to print and place in the hards of the proprietors the report drawn up by the committee of investigation appointed at the last half-yearly meeting, as their best vindication from the imputations of improper management with respect to the coal trade. The figures appended to the accounts show how valuable a traffic this trade has thrown over the line, and the directors are of opinion that it should be continued until the junction of the railway with that of the Ardennes will enable them to dispense with the use of the river. In answer to that portion of their report in which the comimittee say, that inz their "opinion yotur directors somewhat hastily engaged inthis coal trade without first obtaining your consent, and they consider that the whole question should have been previously submitted to you for debate and decision," the directors feel catled upon to remark that they did not engage in this trade without having consulted and received the approval of the shareholders, and they cannot but think the committee have not sufficiently studied the half! early reports, or .they would have seen that the eharge they make is unfounded. The directors havo furtber to state, as a matter of the greatest regret to them, the determination of their colleague' Mr. Sheward, to relinquish his situation as managing director of the company. They consider his services to have been of vast importance, and are deeply sensible of the impossibility of adequately sup. plying his place. They, however, aro happy to state that they Ehall still retain his valuable assistance and advice as a member of the board. The report of Mr. Sherard, the mauaging director, states that 86,699 miles were ;un by the trains during the half -year against 102,325 miles in the corresponding period of last year. The consumption of coke was 2,770 tons againet 3,832 tons. The number of passengers conveyed was 72,131 agalnst 71,543 at the corresponding period of 1856. The quantity of goods conveyed was 1S6,363 tons, showing a diminution of 25,743 tons as compared with the corresponding perlod of 1856. They had carried 18,837 tons of coal to Vlireux against 19,702 tons in 1856. On the 14th of April last an accident ccourred on the line in cousequence of the brealdng of an axle of the tender. The train ran off the rails, by which four persons in a third-class carriage had their legs brolken, one of whom sank under the operation of amputation, and the others are now quite recovered. The repairs of the roling-stock have been heavy and expensive; only one encgine now requires anything being done to it. The last two new engines from Couillet are still in the shed, not having been used. Every effort has been made by all those employed on the line to brin- trade to it, but the depression In France and Beygium has seriously affected tbe traffic. The construction account to the 30th of June showed that 1,082,8711. bad been received, and 1,089,705. excended, leaviTg a balance of 6,8341. aainst the company. The revenue account showedthat2f,0001 had been received, and 19,975a. expended, leaving a balance of 8,0251. To this was added 6,8591., the balance from the former account. 3,5001. Govern7nent guarantee, and 1,4391. fcr renewals, making 29,9011. From this Is deducted 7,6031. interest on bends, 4,6751, interest on preference eanital 4501. for sinking fund, 2551. expense of working the little railway, and 681. for rent, leavng a balance of 16,8481. to be carried forward. The produce from the carriage of coal, c., on the railway arising from the coal trade between 1854 and Junie, 1857, amounted in weight to 87,330 tons, and in amount to 440,373f. (17,6151.) It appears from the report of the directors on the pro sed agreemuent for the joint working of the Samnbre and Oue, Char;ery and Louvain, and Chatelineau and Morlalm6 railways, that a negotiation, of which a full account is given, was continued for five months without arriving at any definite arrangement. It was proposed that the Sambre and Mouse Railway Company should take 461 per cent. of the total receipts of the three companies, beii7g guaranteed during the firstt three years that the 464 per cent, should produce a net receipt of 25,4571. per annum, to commence on the Ist of January, 1858. It was also proposed that a newr company should be formed by the amalgamation of the three companies, with a npitl o 2,00,001, o whch ,60,001.should representthepresentcapital, an=d 4OO,0Ol. he for the continuation of the line to the French lines at M6zleres, and for the increase of rolling stock, &e. According to the fixed proportion of 46.3 per cent. for the Sambre and Meuse, its share of the capital of the news company would be 744,0007. WEST FLANDERS. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts on the old line exeemd those of the corresponditg half-year of 1856 by above 6801., while the receipts on the guaranteed lines from Courtrai to Poperinghe (26 miles) and from Ingelmunster to Deynze (16 mIles) are in exces by 790&[on the former and 4201. on the latter line. The expenditure on all the lines has been reduced by 3041., being now at the rate of 1831. per mile for the half-year. The balaice hfalf-year, is f 3,60,6L, which wI allow of a Pdiviendg of 2s, Bd. per share, and leave a balance of 2621. The directors have continued, under the resolution of the general meetings of the 17th of Bay aad tU 27th of Niovember, 1855, to purohase the company's shares with the unds act their disposal for that purpose, and have added 35 to the number of 275 shares reported at the general neetlng held last May. The report of Mr. Chantrell, the managing director in Belgium, states that the receipts for the halfyear ending the 30th of June last on the old line from Bruges to Courtrsi amounted to 266,423f. 110,6571.), on the new line from Courtrat to Popeiinghe 160,896f. (6,4361 ), and from Ingelmunster to Deynze 41,786f. (1,6711.); together 18,7641. The progressive increase of the trafric on the old line, 33 miles in length, is shown In a ta'ole, front which it appears that the receipts for the half-year ending June 30, 1851, amounted to 166,860f.; ending June 30, 1852, to 184,590f.; ending June 30, 1853, to 200,844f. - ending June 30, 1854, to 214,809f.; ending June 30, 1855, to 248,SCOf. ; ending June 30, 1856, to 249,335f.; ard for the half-year ending Jane 30, 1857, to 26I,423F., Ehowing an increase in gix years of 39,S63f. or 59 7 per cent. The receipts on the new line3 armounted for the half year ending 30th June to 202,683f., and for the correspondiog period of 1856 to 172,449f., showing an increase of 30,214f., or 17 5 per cent. He states that a steady increase of traffic is shownin every branch on all the lines, and that the increase continaes gatisfactor; up to the present timue, with every prospect of a good winter eeason, the harvest having been very .ne, and the trade of the country being in a very sound state,. Thebalance of the guarantee due by the Belgian Government for the year 1856 of 151,407f. was duly received and accounted for. The company's claim for the first six months of 1857 amounts to 145,452f., which will probably be settled shortly. These sums the company are allowed to receive under reserve of their rights, as what the company claim is 244,33Sf. for the year 18I56 and 176,301£. for the first mouths of 1857. The differences of 92,930f. for the former period, and 30,849f. for the latter, form the portion of the worldng expenses of the guaranteed lines imposed upon the old line in consequernce of its being more productive, and is so mnuch lost to the original shareholders. The appeal made to the Minister of Public Works is still under the consideration of the Government advisers. The works on the newv line from Lichiervelde to Furnes are proceeding rapidly, and more than balf the line is ready for working. The buildings are far advanced, and the whole lne, 21 ruiles in length, Is expected to be opened for traffic in the month of May next. The capital account showed that 600,6781. had beeen received and 596,9261. expended, leaving a balance of 3,7524. Th-e revenue account for the half-year showed that 18,7641. had been received, and 13,7141. expended, leaving a balance of 5,050! NEWPORT, ABERGAVENNY, AND BEREFORD. The works on this company's Taff Vale extension line are fast approaching completion, and in all probability will be opened about Christmas. A slip which happened at the mouth of the tunnel about ten days ago delayed the works consideaably, otherwise the opening would have taken place at the end of the present month. The Maesycwmarawr vladuct, at the Bhymney junction, six ~niles from Crumlin, is in length 852fS. 6in., in breadth at the foundation of piers, 40ft. ; thickness of piers at bottom, lOft. ; ditto at springway, fSt. Gin. The height of the bridge above tho -river is 120ft., and there are 16 arches of 40ft. span. EAST KENT. It is stated that the first portion of this line,from Chatham to Eaversham, will be formally opened on Wednesday next, and'arrangementshavebeen madefor openinE thelinebetween trood and Canterhury with the least rossible delay. The tunnelling on the Canterbury and Dover sectioni Is beinm pushed forward, and it is supposed that the whole line b;' t ween Strood and Dover 'ill be finished in about 18 months, RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. A return of the number and nature of t-he railway accidents which occurred on all the railways open for traffic in the united kingdom during the fLrit six months of the curren' year, I8S7, has been published by order Of Parliament. It thence appears that throughout the whole kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland) the number of accidents to trains amounts to 32, of wbich 21 were passenger trains, and 11 goods trains. The total number of pfrsons killed and injured amounted to 20 and 315 respectively. There were 13 passengers kiDed and 295 hurt, besides 6 servants of companies kiled and 20 hurt. As regards the accidents to passenger trains 10 were caused by collisions of all sorts-i by running into sidings, owing to the points being misplaced, 8 by trains getting tff the rails, and 1 by the breaking of axles or wheels. Of the 10 accidents to goods trains 3 were caused by collisions, 3 by the breaking of wheels or axles, and 4 by the bursting of boilers of eingines. The grand total number of accidents to servants of comI anies or of contractors upon railways during the half-year ended the 30th of June last amounted to 44 killed and 38 injured; 10 were kiled and 21 hurt from causes beyond their own control, while 84 were killed and 17 injured from want of caution or misconduct. The list includes 2 drivers kMled and 7 hurt, 4 firemen killed and 4 hurt, 7 guards and breaksmen killed and 9 hurt, 7 porters killed and 2 hurt; 2 policemen killed, 1 gentleman killed and 1 hurt, 2 platelayers killed, and 11 labourers killed and 8 hurt, also, 8 "miscellaneous" persons kiLed and 7 hurt.

o LASGOOV, Friday.-Tn-s Nm-E PEBR CN-T.-The intimation yesterday that the Bank of England had raised the 1 ate of interest to 9 per cent., though not unexpected, produced here a feeling of much uneasiness, folloved as it was by an immediate resolution on the part of the local banl s to advance the terms of dlscount to the same amount. A me eting of the Chamber of Commerce was held the same afternoon, when it was represented that the rate of interest, coupled with a feeling of growing financial insecurity, was likely, if long continued, to he productive of disastrous results. Already the majority of the mills were on halftin e, and should relief not soon be granted the millowners venld be compelled to olose their works entirely, thus throwing thousands Into a state of destitution. Indeed, many hundreds were now idle and subsisting on charity. It was unanimously resolved to send a deputation to London on Monday nexb to crave that the Government would afford some suc relaxation as that granted in the crisis of 1847. A deputation wa accordingly appinted, consisting of the Lord Provost, the Dean of Guild, Mr. Walter Buchanan, M.P.; Mr. Scott, of Kelly; Mr. Dunlop, of Craigton; and Mr. 13annan, of Henry Monteith and Co. Soax DIsTINcTnoIs o CsAiTrrS.-To the Brahmins all animal food, save that of fishes and kids, is forbidden - yet in some districts they will readily partake of the flesh of any animal whatever, if only, as in the case of other Hindoc s; it be not killed with their own hand. The Rajpoots eat fish, mutton, and venison; fowls, beef, and pork are be!d in abotnination. Many castes follow the same rules. Wlth some, however, pork is the favourite diet; beef only is prohibited. Those who shrink from the pollution of eating the flesh of domestic poultry will eagerly devour that of the jungle fowl, which differs from the gamecock only In size. All Hindvog consider themselves defiled by contaob only wisth feathers; among the tribes at the foot of the Himalayas, who aro in other respects strict Hindoos, this prejudice does not exist. An earthen pot is polluted beyond redemption by being teucbed by one I of an inferior caste; a metal one sofl'ers no such de'terioration. Coolies vill cairy any Ic ad, however offensive, upon their heads; bid them carry a n an for a few paces, and, though it be a matter of life and death, they vwll Laswrer you that it is the business of another csste. The RohiUas will submit to be flogged within an inch of their lives with a leathern martingale, but to be stnrck with a whip or cane would be an indelible disgrace, and very likely to be resented with a bullet or a stab Spirituous liquors are in general only allowed to Pariahs.

Among the Totiyars, In the same coast, those witbin the degrees of consanguinity lossess their wives in common.

LONDON, MOIWYDAY, NOVEMBER 9,1857. In literary and scientific societies it is given out that such or such a subject will be diacussed on such an evening,-a paper will be read by this or that distinguished professor, or traveller, or engineer, or Oriental scholar, or antiquary ; questions are to be put, and a debate is invited on the subject. The British Association and the Archteological Association have their programmes, from which they will not swerve ; the lecturer appears, as the clock strikes, with map or inscription, or Roman tile, or skeleton of bird, or beast, or fish. The clock strikes again, and a new set of drawings covers the wall, and a new professor makes his bow. In the political world it is rather difficult to have a programme. One may make out a bill of fare, but it is a great question -whether the dishes on the table will exactly correspond with it. Our true biU of fare here is the one which events make for us, and any paper one that we make out beforehand ever so neatly and clearly must be prepared to give way to this rude rbality. We may arrange our order of subjects, and deTote the next session to the consideration Of some particular social or financial or other improvement, when up from the dark uniathomable crater of events-that mysterious subterranean repository of the world's force and action-comes such a discharge of rough misshapen Matter that our whole plan is immediately clogged up, and we find the ground that we had mnarked out so complacently occupied by a pyramnd Of lava. We have then to leave off our plans and outlines, and set to work with pickaxe, spade, and shovel, clearing off this black heap. What an extraordinary confusion does a little sbake of mother earth make of a domesEtic interior; the dining-table lifted up into immediate proximity to the best bed; the drawing-room sofas and armchairs embracing the beer-barrel in the cellar ; the sideboard set vis-A--vi. to the magnificent mirror. We have half of the dining-room in the drawing-room, half of the drawing-room in the attics, the butler's pantry bisecting the boudoir, and a whole scale of heterogeneous sections looking one another in the face with astonishment. The political world is subject to convulsions not very unlike these volcanic disturbances, and the results are sometimes almost as grotesque. Even the ordinary shifting of events, the average amount of suddenness, is enough to produce great disarangements. In the most quiet -times no one ventures to say exactly what will come next. Parliament has mysterious cycles of its own, and sometimes one subject is up, and aometimes another, as the wheel goes round. A statesman may be ever so determined, but he cannot make Parliament a.tend to him when it is not interested in his subject. He must watch the return of attention. And sudden great events, of course, put everything out immediately. There is a geaeral rush of interest to the new quarter, nobody thinks of listening to an old subject, and the progranvne, if there was one, is dropped like an old playbill, nobody stooping to pick it up. It is a new instance how shortsighted the best of us are, that the session of 1858 has been particularly devoted to the subject of a, hew Parliamentary RWorm Bill. In matter of fact we find, as we really approach the session, and see what 'we have to do, and put ourselves in a Parliamentary 3state of mind, that this caunot be the case, simply for this reason, -that no one person In the House, except the very few with whom such Reform happens to be a crotchet or a personal affair, will be able to attend for five consecutive minutes to the subject. What have we been talking about ever since Parliament was prorogued,-for that is the best test of -what we shall want to talk al)out when Parliament meets again? Has the question of Parliamentary Reform been once alluded to in any public speech for the last three months ? We cannot undertake to say positively that it never once has been, becaus3 we cannot say that we have read every word of every speech from beginning to. end; but, speaking as ordinary readers, who have read these speeches fairly through and caught their main substance, we think we may say, that not one single speaker of the whole number, except perhaps Lord JOnr RUSSELL, has mentioned Parliamentary PReform prominently, and that hardly one even has mentioned it at all. The great subject of the Indian Mutiny has engrossed al thought and interest. It would, indeed, have been wonderful If it had not. There may be anomalies in our representative system, but nobody can pretend to say that to the great mass of the community these anomalies are any particular grievances. It may be true enough that many who ought to have votes at elections have not. A gentleman who has 5001. a-year in the Three per Cents., and lives in lodgings, has no vote I Terrible anomaly ! But who cares about it? The gentleman himself ? Not one straw. The Parliamentary Reformer is the tender-hearted suferer, whom he deputes to grieve for him. A whole string of such irregularities in our system might doubtless be made out, but when you have got them all what do they amount to in the way of felt grievance?' In point of fact, the worll at large does not really care much about Parliamentary Reform, however willing it might have been, as a matter of public duty, to support such a measre when brought forward by respectable men. ln this state of things the tremendous Indian convulsion takes place, our empire is threatened, the most horrible outrages are committed, Ileetloads of troops are sent out, and a contest has evidently begun of which we cannot foresee the length or the fierceness. It would have been very strange if the country had much attention to spare for a political hobby when such a real crisis was at her doors; and the same reasons will hold good when Parliament meets, with the addition of some others. It is idle to expect that Parliament can enter upon the dry discussion of the anomalies of our representative system, and listen to crotchets and speculations on a subject on which not one man in fifty in his heart cares a jot, with the stern and overwhelming pressure of this Indian Mutiny upon it. People find out in a moment at such a time what they really care about and what they feel comparatively easy about. But,besides the pressure of the event itself, the retrospect connected with it, the criticism of measures and men, the due apportionment of praise and blame will occupy the att3ntion of Parliament. There must and will be interminable debates on causes, on policies, "traditionary" and other; on what the Indian Governments have done right or wrong for the last 50 years; on what the present Indian Government has done for the last six months. When people's minds are full of a subject it is impossible to limit the progress of discussion or confine the endless multitude of details and ramification of results, direct and indirect, into which it developes; and besides the past there is the future. The question of the reconstitution or modific2tion of the existing Indian Government, whether we should assume direct Royal dominion over India or not, and whether the East India Company should go on or not, and, if it is to go on, how and with what qualifications,-the question of the reorganization of the Indian armny, whether we are to have a native army at all or how limted a one,-the question of military improvemenis in general, as hanging on to that of the Indian service,-the question of purchase, Ac.,-a whole world of questions Will come out, will demand full discussion, and will actually obtain superfluous and interminable discussion. Excess will be only justice to such material. UInder these circumstances we do not think that the subject of Parliamentary Reform will stand much chance in the next session. Lord JoiN RusswEL will doubtless not like the postponement of what, with all respect, we must call his hobby. He will probably see no reason why we should not, in the very thick of our Imperial disasters,be discussing boroughs, ten-pound householders, householders in towns not boroughs, the Bize of boroughs with reference to new enfranchisements or disfranchisements, and everything about boroughs, hustings, quialifications, registrations, &c. Like Hope " lighting her torch at nature's funeral pile," he would doubtless be ready, should our Indian empire or tle world itself come to an end, to sibmit, t'prepos of the event, a scheme of Parliamentary Re"orm to tho House, but we question whether he would have many attentive and Eatient listeners.
Our correspondent " INOoPnLus" pursues his addresses to the publlc this morning on a topic which will not fail to arrest the attention of our readers, and which was certainly not likely to escape our own. What is to become of the Indian Press? In the reorganization of that marvellous empire what use is to be made of an agency which, wherever British dominion extends, has been found the most powerful of known instruments in the work of civilization and progress? Is India to feel the influence of a Press? and, if so, under what conditions or regulations should this profession be exercised? These are obviously questions of no rifing import. The answer to them, as we must needs E a expected to say, is perfectly clear, and we concur entirely witch " INDoPnLus "1 as to the form it saould take. The inquiry thus brought b3fore us is altogether independent of the policy which, under the pressure of a revolutionary crisis, the Government of India lately found itself compelled to adopt. What could be said in Lord CAumw's justification our readers have already seen. We shall easily bo believed when we express the reluctance which we felt in assenting to the propriety of any measures against the freedom of the Press, and the extreme perils and most precarious advantages at-ending any such course, even in the severest cmergencies, have been sufficiently evinced by the course of events. We trust that the security anticipated from the repression of pubYeations deliberately seditious has been actually experienced, but it is impossible to shut our eyeb to the embarrassments and evils which the proceeding has inevitably entailed. T'he Press of India is now aniImated with so vindictive a spirit, and entertains against the Government such a malignant and not -unnatural hostility, that we look in vain for any impartial opinions or unbiassed reports concernincg the policy of the Adminbtrai tion. Although, moreover, the new cen- sorship is freely exercised, it ts utterly beyond the power of any authorities to escape damage altogether. A direct invective may be stopped, a particular article may provoke a warning, and some journal lJe adroitly managed than others may incur the penalty of suppresion; but all the while attacks are covertly conducted through every paragraph and in every page of the paper, till in the end the effect produced upon the mind of the reader is far more injurious to the Government than the most open and determined opposition. We do not say that of tWo evils Lord CAIMrIa may not, at so unexampled a crisis, have chosen the least, but the alternative was a very disastrous One indeed. We coincide, however, entirely with " InDO' 9Hrl s" in thinkng that no material difficulty need attach to the substantial freedom of the Press in India under ordinary conditions of government. The embarrassments hitherto experienced have arisen not so much from the characteristics of Indian society as from the impolicy of the views adopted by the Administration. European, or, m other words, English society in India, Is divided into two great elements, separated from each other by, apacioia lf. Firt, there are the British residentz in the service of the Company, whether military or civil; and, secondly, there are the British reidents occupied in independent pursuits, and unconnected with public employment. The former of these clases isbyfar the more numerous, and, without any diragement of the latter. it may be said by far the more Intelligent. It. comprehends, indeed, all theintellect and ability which are annually draughted off from these shores for serVIce in the East, and constitutes no inefficient representation of British character. The latier clasw comprises many enterprising, educated, and honourable men. It admibt, in fact, as far as its numbers go, of being matched in these respects against the former, but its position is unfavourable, and its views exposed to strong and injurious bias. The servants of the Company not only form a caste, but a governing caste, and such privileges are naturay rritating in the eyes of men who are Englishmen as well as they. The two cLasses differ I even in the opinions with which they regard India i anclits population. The governing class is content with India as it is. Saving always its own prerogatives, it is dispoeed to look with favour upon the claimi and even the prejudices of its subjects, and by no means inclined to allow any advantages to the independent European communiiy. For the sake of peace and quietness it would leave Hindooism untouched, would adapt! its administration to a native population exclusively, and would prefer, upon the whole, that the points of contact between England and India should be through the East india Company alone. The independent class rebels against these principles, and thinks that Englismen should have equal rights. In claiming, however, India for the English it does not leave quite so much of India for the Indians, and its views, perhaps, would hardly be so immediately favourable to the native population as those of the class which has got aJil it wants, and, having only to exercise government, and not submit to it, can afford to be serenely impartial. Under these circumstances the Press, like other British institutions, found an establishment in Ind2a, and for a certain period worked very serviceably. Ia an evil moment, however, and by an unhappy thought, a notification was issued of which the effect was to debar from any participation in public writing the whole of that numerous and able class tbrough whose immediate instrumentality the Government of India was conducted. No person connected with the Government-in other words, none of the many thousand servants of the Company-could carry either his information or his talents to the work of newspaper discussion, and the consequence was, that except for such evasions of the rule as were unavoidable, the Indian Press fell entirely into the hands of a class numerically inferior, inimical to the ruling powers by the very force of its position, and necessarily, in eomparison with Government officers, bat imperfectly informed. Never could a policy have been more disustrous. Government was deliberately placing itself and its acts at the greatest possible disadvantage. It was proscribing its own advocates and silencing its own counsel. The proceeding represented a complete inversion of the policy pursued in some absolute States. Instead of attempting to inspire or control the Press for its own benefit, the Indian Government actually made it over to its opponents for their exclusive use; while men who could have set the Administration on its legs in a moment, corrected errors, and diffused accurate knowledge, were restrained by the enactments of their own caste from taking up a pen. It is really impossible to exaggerate the proportions of this monstrous blunder. Half the value, and perhaps more than half the influence, of the English Press is due to that universal practice of correspondence, which literally brings a vast portion of the British nation into co-operation with The Times. Our columns are powerful, as expressing not merely what we think, but what everybody thinks. There is not a public question started on which we do not receive, either for publication or otherwise-eitler for the instruction of the country or our own information-communica. tions of the most van..d and authentic oharacter. Our readers little dream of the very high authority occasionally attaching, under some unobtrusive signature, to the correspondence we place before them ; and it is by means of these aids-by this remarkable association of knowledge and opinions -that truth is brought to light. In our pages everybody finds a hearing and every policy an expression, until at last the public discovers itself in possession of an unexceptionable result. This might have been the case in India even in a more striking degree, for public writing is there such a propensity, either of the profession or the place, that every Indian officer would sit down to an article or a letter as the most natural employment in the world-indeed, the only difficulty is to get them to stop. If this comimnicative disposition were but judiciously encouraged, what chance could any factious or wanton opponents of the Government preserve in the face of such able, such well-informed, and such indefatigable writers? Little, indeed; whereas, by foolishly thinking to ignore an irrepressible power. the ndiLan Adninistration left to the use of it3 antagonists an agency which it might have em. ployed for its own defence and the unquestionable benefit of the country at large.
That there is a connexion between health and wealth deeper than the rhyme which so naturally comes to our lips, the anrual reports of the REGISTRAR-GmNER.AL and of Dr. LTHasBY-the latter pub. lished in our impression of Thursday-strikingly illustrate. So long as we look to individual cases, indeed, it scems like a mockery to suggest that gold is the elixir of life. We are answered by the smile of the lordly invalid, who envies the poorest labourer in his harvest fields; by the sigh of men who would pour out wealth untold if it would avail to rescue from the tomb those dearer to tiem than life; by the song of the poet, which gives long years and happiness to some village blacksmith, who fceds on brown bread and water, and toils at his forge from morn to night; by the babble of dem_gogues, who, n istaking £trength of muscle for strength of constitution, delight to contrast the sturd:ness of the artisan with the puniness of the asistocrat. It is when we extend our view from individuals to the mass of men that the grand result sbines forth clear and unmistakeable, and nowhere is it more evident than in this London, the wealthiest city in the world, where to all appearance the luxury and the splendour that belong to the upper ClaseWs serve rather aa a foil than as a cure to the wretchedneus and mortality which prevail among the lower orders. It is scarcely credible, but yet the incontestable figures quoted by Dr. LETIrsaY leave it beyond all doubt, that the average of health throughout the City of London is higher than the ! average of health throughout all England, taking town and country together. The mortality in all England is at the rate of 22-8 in every 1,000 of the population; in the City of London it is at the rate of 22-3 for every 1,000 inhabitants. The advantage in our favour thus expremsed in a decimal which is equivalent to only half an individual for every 1,000 is not very great, although, indeed, it comes to a considerable saving of life when the thousands are multiplied by hundreds. But, on the other hand, two circumstances lead us to regard even this small advantage with no ordinary satisfaction. For, in the first place, the improvement has been progressive; it has been slow, but steady and sure. Gradually the mortality has decreased, until the usual yearly death-roll of 3,763 has been reduced to 2,904 within the period of nine years during which the City has been under the rule of the Sanitary Commission. The deaths thls year-22-3 per thousand, or 1 in every 45 of the inhabitants-are 9 per cent. below the general average, and represent a saving of 286 lives. And, secondly, this gratifying result has been obtained in the face of obstacles which seemed to be almost insurmountable. Here is this City of London actually walled in from all the vivifying inauences of the country by miles of obdurate brick; we are incarcerated in a maze of houses, shops, and factories, as cunningly contrived as any Cretan Labyrinth; our river is still polluted; our streets are narrow and confined; our houses, which were built when there was a tax on every brick, on every nail, on every windowpane, are sadly deficient in light and air; and every inch of ground is so valuable that -we are huddled together with the dingy smoke above us, and with the London fog around us, enduring, a stranger might well fancy, discomforts not very different from those which our countrymen once experienced in the Black Hole of Calcutta. And yet here are the bills of mortality, 'which tell us that our attempts to cope with the disadvantages of our position have been crowned with success, and that the average of health in the City is greater than the average of health in England at large. Such tables as these we conceive ought to be read by the light of other tables which indicate the growth of the national wealth. Year by year, and sometimes month by month, we have called the attention of our readres to those returns of Trade and Navigation which show how wonder- fully the resources of the nation have multiplied. If these returns are to be taken as the measure of our wealth, then, on the other hand, the returns of the REusrAr -GxuA and of Dr. LnmHEy are to be regarded as a material test of the uses to which we have turned our wealth. Has it added to the happiness, to the comfoxc, to the security, to the length of life? And, depend upon it, if t hese questions can be answered in the affirmative, if a physical improvement is very evident, it is but the type and the accompaniment of a raoral improvement which is better than wealth, and without which the lengthening of life might be merely the continuance of degradation. But, while congratulating our fellow-citizens on the results which have crowned their sanitary regulations, we should ill perform our duty if we did not insist that very much has yet to be done. SmaU though the death-roUl for the present sear be, it is not the smallest on record,-it is only the smallest but one; and it is quite ev.:dent from many points of -vew, but chiefly from three which we sball immediately indicate, that it is our own fault if we do not attain to a still higher level of general health. Whether we compare the ages of the persons wbo have died, or their occupations, or the localities in which they lived, the singular disparities which are to be found lead of necessity to this conclusion. If we look to the localities, for example, it will be found that the 9 per cent. of decrease on our annual average of deaths has been chiefly effected in the central district of the City, where the improvement has been to the extent of 13 per cent. upon the average, and in some places has even reached to 38 per cent., while, on the other hand, in the western division of the City it has not been more than 7 per cent., and in the eastern has been only 3 per cent. All this-and especially that trifling 3 per cent. of the eastern district, which is the most crowded and ill-regulated part of the City, Ehows how much has still to be done by omr aa iitary officers, how difficult it is to enforce cleanliness and decency among a people habituated to crime and all sorts of brutishness, and also how great is the hope that by perseverance we may render our metropolis not only what it is now, the healthiest capital in Europe, but it may be as salubrious as the hiUls to which our sportsmen aDnually resort. Then, if we regard the ages of the deceased, we shaU arrive at precisely the same conclusion. Of the 2,904 deaths for the pamb year how many were infants under five years of age? There were not less than 1,163that is to say, 400 out of every 1,000 persons who died last year. The fact is, that although the average of health in London is higher thanr in England generally, this result is due chiefly to the extraordinary health of Londoners in the prime of life. Between the ages of 10 and 35 the mortaity is comparatively small,-the advantages are immensely in favour of a city life. But beyond these limits the proportion of deaths is, it appears, much larger than in the rest of England. These facts seem to point to causes which are very much, if not entirely, within our own control-causes, too, which it is by no means difficult to discover when we can lay our finger on such a fact as this, that the diseases which at the periods of life we have named, and especially among infants, render the mortality of Lardon greater than the mortality of England, are chiefly tubercular, and when we L now that these diseases are mainly to be attributed to what Dr. LzTuEg B cal "domestic vices,t including under that head all that tends to make home unhealthy and unhappy. The London atmosphere being so little iDjurious to persons between the ages of 10 and 35, it. therefore cannot be accepted as a necessary sacrifice to our position that no less than 1,163 infants should die annually, and this, too, out of a mortality which only extends to 2,904 individuals. There must be a large margin for .mprovement-a margin which will be still more pparent if, after having thu s r egarded the effect of locality and of age on the proportion of deaths, we now glance at the influence of occupation. This is in some respects one of the most curious suLbjects of investigation, as we proceed from class to class,-from the butcher, who is comparatively a healthy animal, to the tailor and the printer, who hold life on a more precarious tenure, then to the publicans and porters, after these to tie painters and glaziers, to the cabmen an, draynmen, who come next, to the clerl;s and needlewo men, who are still lower in the scale, and so on to the hard-working carpenters, masons, and daylabourers, who fare the worst of all. AU these closses have their peculiar dieases-phthisis being the malady of printers and bakers, fever of domestic servants and cabmen, bronchitis of painters, butchers, and costermongers, brain disesese of porters and bargemen, and liver diseases . I of publicans. Xt is inpoibie to esape entirely t.he malalies incideUtal to certain occupations, but surely the fact that particular complaints can be so easily apportioned among particular trades justifies the hope that, with ordinary care, their prevalence can be very much diminished. To interfere for the benefit of the trades, and to encourage those appliances which may tend to mitigate the injurious effects of certain avocations, is not, perhaps, so strictly within the province of a Sanitary Commission as it is to provide for the purity of the atmosphere ana the cleanliness of our houses and streets. Still, who can doubt that an immense field for improvement lies in this direction, and that we can protect ourselves from the injury of our occupations just as much as from the inclemency of the weather and from the impurity of the atmosphere? And, putting these three considerations together,-comparing the excessive mortality of certain districts with the healthiness of others in their immedikte neighbourhood,observing the singular Immunity from disease which Londoners enjoy in those years when they are most active and mort in the open air; lastly, noting the morbid influences of occupation, the brain diseases of porters, and the liver complaints of publicans, telling their own sad tale of miseries that might very often be prevented,-are we not justified in the conclusion that, although our past success has been great and reflects the highest credit on our sanitary officers, still tha work which has been accomplished is as nothing to that which has yet to be achieved?

THE9 MAIN lDAIZA(GE OF LONDOr. TO TE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-This question has at last assumed a practical shape, and, although it appears paradoilcal to say so, It is settled allexcept tho plan and who Is to pay for it. The drama Is cast, but the two prlnclpal partg are still under consideration. The Chief Commissioner teats London in a local spirit; the metropolis Is to be self-supporting, and, to carry out this spirit, the funds derived from port dues, coals, and house taxes are administered by antagonistic bo dies and squandered upon.corporate pageants. The rateable value of London as defined in the Metropolis Local Mranagement Act Is stated to be 12,000,0004; the rea is 117 square miles. The rateable value of the city of London, only one mile square, is 1,000,000wL; the reverne of the latter, derived from an area of more than 300 square miles, exceeds that of the whole metropolis, minus the city, and in addition to that the Imperial Exchequer derives 100,0001. a-year frorn a taX upon cabs and omrlbuses. This anomaly In the applicatfon of funds, towards whilch I as a citizen of London must pay my quota, does not depend upon the exercise of maladministration, which I can control, but upon legidative enautments pased by an Imperi PaliUament with various objects and at long Intervals. At one timo the loyalty of the London apprentices is secured or recompensed by charters granting speoial privileges; at another, railway companies buy off the opposition of a city zaction, by smuggling into their Bills a clause taxing co ls for the benefit of a clique already rolling in wealth. For years 117 square miles of buildings are left to the mercy of one square mile, who are uncompromising as to their rights of levying black mail for the benefit of their one square mile and to the detriment of 116 square mfie The Thames -the speoial property of this city corporation, a property defended against the Crown in fierce lawsuits, some of them a oentury old,-the Thames becomes daUy more polluted and less looked after. What is everybody's business is nobody's business, until the cholera moves the most apathetic by the sense of self-preservatlon. Then follows an era of commissions-Sanitry Commis. slone, Boards of Health,Sewers Commissions, and, last of all this complicated machinery is thrown upon the shoulders of London as one whole, embraced in 117 square wiles, aud administered by a Metropolitan Board of Works, an elective body- appointed by the ratepayers. Now, Sir, I acoept this responsibility, and will be very glad to look after and pay for what conduces to my health and comfort; but, in common justice, I ask that the coals in my grate, the tallow in my dips, and the room I write in should oontribute to one general fund economically adminis. tered to satisfy the wants of the whole of the 117 square miles I belong to; -ad I argue that if the Legisatue cannot, or will not, thus consolidate us as a whole, and with a uniform system, they have no right to force upon us a municipal government. Sir Benjamin Hall says that 54d. is a small rate to secure the inestimable advantages of a perfect system of drainage and purify the Thames. It may be so; but are we sure that, having become liable to the 56d., the Thames wil be purified and the present offensive exhalations done away with ? Let me quote the opinion of Messrsm Hofmann and Witt, specially instructed by the Government engineers, Messrs. Galton, Simpson, and Blackett, to investigate this question,- Exmicr rOM3 AprEsNDn 1, rAoS 7.

AMEICA. LIVWBRPOOl4 SATURDAY, Nov. 7; The United States' mall steamship Atlntic arrived this afternoon, with advioex from Now York tc the 27th ult. The Baltic and the Borusa a arrived out. The Washington correspondent of the New York Courier anid Infiuirer is of opinion that if Walker finds transport by eea unattainable, nothing il more probable than that he will endeavour to tura his Texan levies upon Mexico, not only in the hopo of conquest, but in order to revenge himself for hi shameful defeat in Lower California. The Mayor of New York had issued & proclamna tion, in which he says :_ "We have over 200,030 persons in this city who, elithe directly or indirectly, depend ior subsistnce upon macguI labour. If the present wrant of employment onatinue many must rely upon either public or pnvate charity, and Ifear thatnot a ew ill reeortto violence and force rather tha subn)it to either of there precarious and humiliating dependencie&" A severe storm prevailed during the 25th and iIt is. announced that the Governor of Georgia wrould withhold any action against the suspeaded ibanks until the meeting of the Legislature. Advices from N[icaragua state that all Americana I[suspected of sympathizing with Walker bad been expelled the country, and great preparations were being made by President Martinez to resist a Flilbustering invasion. The New York Courier and Rgupirer of the 26th remarks that, notwrithstanding the daily reports, that " financial and commnercial afiirs wrere getting easier," and that "as more cheerful feeliung was manifested," commercial affairs had made but little progress in the direction of sound and permanent improvement. " The nlest weekuly statement," it saysl,- " Will showr whether the banks have had the resolution to carry out their asserted intention of in!creasing thei loans and of e&tendlng the circulatcion of State currecy We knowr already that the latter bus been partly frcstrste9I, in eonequence of the adoption of the plan to pay d;aily balances in currency, and that we have already nearly three millions of State currency in thie vulth of She Metro- It does not believe that it wvould be advisable to resume specie payments at present, with such an unsettled financisl condition both at home man abroad. It thinks, however, that if the banks, by a liberal course, and by a total abandonmenlt of their present selfish policy, could get the cooperation of the community, specie payment could safely be resumed. The Courier and .lnquirer gives acme tabular returns showting that the holders of States bonds have ample security, apart from State credit and honour. The total debts amounted to $i238,902,542, while the taxable property in 1850 was $i6,580,000,000. T]he amount of bullion inthe coffers of the Boston banks when they suspended wFas $;2,461,000; on the 24th it had reached $i2,888,100. The Net', York Times of the 26th says: " The money.market was easier at the close of list week to moderate dealers at bank. The country circulation is adding to the discount ability of the city, and, although the heavy mercantile firms aledy mn embarasent are not relievcd by it, the case is different with trade generally. The stock-market is depressed by the foreign accounats-the newvs of dearer money inl Engiand and the possibility of embarrassmnent to some of the American houses being acively employed by the speculators aginst a rise. There wvere several heavy failures ruumoured on Saturday, but none so far verified as to authorize the use of names. The domnestilc exchanges with Philadelpohia, Baltimore, and Richmond wrere worse. The European extchanges fromn 1 to 2 per cent, higher for select bills. The pick of bills on london sold at 105 per cent. The range, however, con. tinues wide, and sales wrere made at 101. to l03~ to 105 at 60days, and 106 to 106.3 for bills 20 to 30 days to ron. The feelln8p was less troubled on Saturday in regard to the return of bills drawn in September and early in this month on Ioverpool and London. The agents in this city of the two or three Scotch banks and the correspondents of the London jofnt-stock banks have drawn little or nothing which was ot under acceptance at the latest date. These banks are of undoubted strength. The standard benking finns who drawr on Peabody, Browns, Dennistoun, Fielden, and others, are under no apprehension as to their friends on the other side, nor ought the public to be, in viewv of their knowvn strength. The wreekly import of dry eoods has fallen quite lowv, hile the export list of domestic produce and articles of foreign growth returned for a better market than they find here is on the increase. The rAiny wleather on Saturday ws against a vigorous business in the general produce markets. " The falling off in the freight and pasenger business among the varnous railroad and steamboat lines running out of this cityv presnts in a strikaing light the extent to which the whole bulsiness of the country has been affected by the revulsion. There is scarcely one that his not lost from one-third to tw?o-thirds of its business during the three wreeks of October. " The Governor of Mlissouri is for further strong and direct measures to secure the prompt payment of interest en the public debt, and favoursthe stoppage of tho issue to the railwvays under par. In addition to the Present sinking and interest funde, provided by the last Legislature, he suggests that a direct tsJx be levied on the whole property of the State, at a rate to render certain, beyond all con.- tingency, the payment of interest." According to the New York Tribune, exchange closed on the evening of the 24th at 98 to 103, with some leading drawers aNkmng higher flgu.res. The New York .BcenLi,g MRirror of the 26th says:" The hank statement ia encouragng. It is supposced that before the 20 days are oct for the date of suspension our prlcipa bsk will resume specie payment.. A large sum as arrived by the Baltio, and large sums sre expected by the next steamcers." In the absence of a more trustworthy aulthority we quote the followfing from the New York Rerald of the 27th:- "There was no movement of consequence in any leading stock securlty, and the operations were principally fos ash he European advices appea to have had aery little effect upon our finances, one way or the other. The feeling in e streethwas so much better than generallyanticopatcd that the market actually improved under the favourable einfguene. we hear of orders from unrope to purchase our stocks, limted at prices considerably above those nowo current.

THB UNITED STATES, (FROM OUR OWN ooltltBSPONDI?-qT.1 NEW YORK, Ocr. 24. 'The news from England by the Europa this week hI had a depressing influence upon our market, none too cheerful before. We are now feeliDg the solid rebound of the want of confidence that began here seven or eight weeks since. For a few days after the suspension of specie payments aanguine lpeople reasoned that we had touched bottom, and -were to fly up like balloons, simply because prices h%ad expanded on a paper currency. The rise was as fictitious as the fall-more so I may say ; be-cause, to a partial extent, the fall was the legitimate result of overexpanslon, whereas the vim was only a cry before we were out of -he wood. The grain still stays in the West, domestic exchanges still continuo In a -state of inertia, failures are still reported daily, and Indigo is still the prevailing colour. The balance at the Sub-treasury is below $6,000,000, and the *transactions at the clearing-house were only a little over $8,000,000 yesterday. Business is stagnant. Yet the bauks, or rather some of the leading ones, ,were discounting more freely yesterday, and opinions were freely expressed by those whose wish was -father to the thought that the present unnatural atate of things was over. I do not think so. No -matter how soon now the crop may be set in motion, At cannot arrive here soon enough to prevent still ,surther and more serious results from the complica4ion of domestic exchanges which has for the past six weeks deranged the whole commerce of the country. The offending railways are rapidly putting out their schemes for extricating themselves from their embarrassment. First on the list of penitents is the Michigan Southern. The new board of direction, among whom are some namnes of character and standing in this community, mixced up with others of less weight, put out a scheme forredeeming themselves by a ne ir mortgage issue of $3,000,000, with which they say that they can provide for a floating -debt of $2,000,000, and put the corporation on its legs again. $1,000,000 of this they aet aside for the guaranteed stock, payable 20 per cent. in cash, 80 per cent. in stock. As these shares are selling at 40, it follows that each S1,000 cost the holder $520. $1,000,000 is set aside for the general shareholders, payable 40 per cent. cash, 60 per cent. in stock. These shares are selling at 10; consequently the ,purchaser of $1,000 pays $460. These two millions are to yieid in cssh $600,000; the other $1,000,000 and the shares and bonds now held in hypothecation, which wifl be set free, are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the balance of the floating -debt. This done, the directors express a confidence In their ability to pay a dividend on the remaining shares. They say that the expenses hilherto have been muore than 70 per cent. on the gross earnings . but they point out certain projected reforms which they say will reduce the expenses to a point consistent with honeatly earned dividends. Their exposition has certainly the merit of frankness, while their scheme of relief, it must be confessed, is somewhat scomplicated. The sum they ask for is a bagatelle, if they can succeed in convincing the public that it ought to be granted them. The Illinois Central Company propose to extricate themselves by the help of the holders of their optional rights; and as an earnest of their merit of confidence will resume payment of their coupons. They propose to lssue a 7 per cent. loan for $3,200,000, payable in 10 years, and convertible before February 20, 1860; certificates of 25 shares, !40 paid, to be issued on surrender of each bond; payments to be made in instalments from February to August, the subscriptions of holders of optional rights to have the preference, provided subcriptions are made before December 1 in London, or before December 15 in New York; -the obligations of the company maturing before January 1, 1859, to be received in payment for subscriptions. The Michigan Central create a first mortgago to secure their existing bonded debt, and to fund their floating debt. Some of the newer land grant roads further west are hopelessly in the mire; but as they are not mnuch held in England, it is of little consequence to the readers of The Times whether they flounder and aink, or flounder and get out of the mire. Of the Eastern roads the most critical is Erie, and If openness in exposure and honesty of management are of value, the most entitled to -sympathy. Since the management changed hands ihls corporation has made a clean breast of it, has admitted the errors of the past, and avowed a purpose, which I believe to be Bincere, of a different administration in future. But it is in a most critical situation, and unless it receives speedy relief it must fall into the hands of the mortgage bondholders. The mortgage debt on this road now amounts to $13,000,000. Then intervene the acceptances on which Mr. Daniel Drew is liable, and for which he holds a mortgage of the road and rolling stock. These amount to about $1,300,000. The other floating debt is secured by the hvpothecation of about $3,500,000 of the fourth mortgage bonds. The finded debt not se cured by mortgage amounts to about $10,000,0V0 outstanding, of which a very large proportion is held in Europe. The holders of these bonds are asked to take the whole of the fourth mortgage issue ($6,000,000 in all), payable 50per cent. in bonds at par, and 50 per cent. in cash, or in coupons falling due before October, 1858, or in acceptances of the company, payable by instalments in ten months. By this plan Mr. Drew's mortgage 'would be got out of the way, the acceptances Secred by the hypothecation of the fourth mortgage bonds would be retired, and the company would, as the direction say, be provided with sufficient means to complete the very important works at Jersey City, and give the road a terminus at deepest tide water. The corporation has been sued on some of its acceptances that have gone to protest, and unless the suits are retired, or some arrangement is made, it must go into the hands of a receiver soon. This need not interfere with the completion of the proposed arrangement, though it would somewhat complicate it. In view of the amount of the unsecured bonds held in Europe, I -certaInly think it worth the while of the European holders oI unsecured bonds to act with some w1vgour and unanimity in the protection of -their property. Steps will be taken for the apeedy foreclosure of Mr. Drew's mortgage. 'The end cannot be much loDger delayed, and I should thinak it would be wise for the creditors, -whose securities will be cut off by a sale of the road a=d rolling stock of this corporation, to send at once an agent or agents to this courntry, fully empowered to examine into this concern and to rescue the property or let it go as they may see fit. In my opinion there is a valuable property here worth saving to these bondholders. It has cost about $38,000,000, it is earning in the gross $6,000,000 or $7,000,000, and it is threatened to be sacrificed by a eale on a little mortgage for about $1,000,000, with only $13,000,000 before it, thus cutting off the loan capital of $10,000,000, mostly held in Europe. There seems to be no power of rescuing it here. 'he subscriptions, which have been dawdling along, amounted yesterday to only about $700,000. Public meetings have been held and speeches made, but the practical remedy is wanting, and unless the Xnglish anad German holders of the convertibles and uinking fund bonds take the matter into their own hands the property wvil pass away and their investinentsbe lost. Thereis vitality enough in the property -to pay the interestuponthe present indebtednesa and uipon the proposea Inereme for the purpose of funding the debt and completing the terminus at Jersey city. This I am sure of, without going into the statementa put forth by the corporation, which have already been transmitted to you as part of the current news of the day. From my personal knowledge of the new management I feel confidence in any statement it may put forth; but I should think it unwise for the European holders of these loans to undertake rescuing their property without first sending some one to inquire, as I have already suggested.
IRTELAND. (II1OM OUR OWN CORRsPONnST.) DUBLIN, SATURDAY MORXMG. TRE INDICTMBrT OF THE GRAND ORANGE LODGE. The Grand Lodge closed Its proceedings on Thlirsday evening, and this forenoon the expected result of its labours In the form of a monster address appears in the congenial columns of the Warder newspaper. A great air of mystery was thrown over the birth of the document. Yesterday It was said that its proportions were so immense as to necessitate its publication in the shape of a pamphlet, just like I the huge lenten pastorals of Dr. ullen, or the statutes of the Synod of Thurles-those terrible encroachers unon the space of newspapers. However, the $>rious, and those who have the requisite amount of patience, may now possess themselves of the case made by the Grand Lodge against the Chancellor anid theIrishGovernment collectively. Meanwhile the Orange campaign does not terminate at this stage. The Grand Lodge stands adjourned to the 2d of December, when the whole subject will be again brought ander consideration with a view to future action. It is said that an Address to the Throne itself Is contemplated, and that, in the event of the Prime Minister refusing to lay it before the Queen, certain noble lords (Roden, Farnham, Enniskillen, and Dungannon) will take the matter in hand, ancd insist upon their constitutional right to bring the grievances of their Orange brethren under the notice of Royalty. The House of Commons is also to be stirred up, and an inquiry is tobe demanded into all the circumstances connectedlwiththe Belfast Commission, the official finding of which is not yet made public. AINOTEER MfONST1 PASTORAL. Apropois of pastorals a provincial Roman Catholic paper (tbe Kiike-niy Journal) has been the first to promulgate the following announcement:- " We have been informed that an important pastoral wiU soon bo issuied by the Moat Rev. Dr. Cullen, which will deal principally with the treatmenzt to which Catholics in the British army and navy are subjected, and which will also refute the replles which his Grace's late letter provoked from Lord St. Leonard's and others in England. Frrm what we have heard of the forthooming pastoral it promises to have all the lmportance of an Irish State paper. It will be a comnplete vindication of his Grace's letter, and a crushing oxposure, by facts and figures, of the marner in which the funds of the Patriotio Commission wero distributed and appropriated." The organ then inidicates the probable sulbstance of the pastoral:- " With regard to the treatment of Catholic soldiers in India, we have seen letters recently from priests in that country which state that, instead of the Indian officials becoming sore just or generous towards those who are shedding their blood in the cause of England, the Indian authorities are only becoming more persecuting every day. One of the letters to which we allade states that Lord Harris, Governor of Madras, has expressed it as his opinion, and written to the Governor-General recommending it, that all Catholic chaplains who protest against the rule that the children of Catholic soldiers shall attend Protestan schools should be forthwith deprived of their miserable stipend and sent about their business I But this is not all. Lord Harris has issued an order that all officers attending soldiers at mass shall, according to their own judgment, order the soldiers from the chapel if there be anything said by the priest to which objectio-n can be taken. We have reason to believe that all these facts have come to the knowledge of the Archbishop of Dublin, and that his Grace is likely to refer to them in his forthcoming pastoral, which promises to thrill like a trumpet-blast-to be heard even in India." THE MrAYO PRIESTS. A Derbyite journal states that the Rev. Peter Conway, and the Rev. Luke Ryan, of Mayo election notoriety, have received letters notifying them that proceedings will be immediately commenced against them on behalf of the Crown, as directed at the close of the last Session of Parliament. No two gentlemen of their cloth ever more righteously deserved to have their conduct submitted to the judgment of a jury of their fellowcountrymen. Bat the time is inopportune; and the contest for Mayo, with its clerical Rowdeyism, has long since passed from the public mind. TUiE LATE OUTrtAGE IN MEATH. A letter, dated Kells, Thursday evening, says " I understand that nine men have been arxreted on suspicion of being concerned in the waylaying of Mr. Connell, the particulars of which I sent you on Monday. They wero all brought up before the magistrates at Crossakill today, when Mrs. Connell and his Sister, who were with hlm at the time, identified three out of the nine as being some of the p arty who attacked them. They have been committed to Trim Gao, as also the other siiX, for further examination. Mr. Connell is in a very p~-ecarious state, and the general opinion is that he cannct recover." T1E, MONTARY PRESSURE. The following remarks are condensed from the commercial article in the lDtblin t-ening Post " We can bave no desire to underrate the present crisis in monetary affairs, arising mainlyfrom the American panic, but to ud it clearly appears that the soundness and stability of our trade and the strong position of the Irish banking ebtablishuients--the result of prudent and judicious managenent, espeoially in latter years-afford sure gacrantees that the excitement will pass over without injury to the commercial community. This opinion we have expressed from the commlsencement, when, unlike others, we held that there could not be a panic and a financial revolution in the United States, far the greatest market for British and Irish manufactures, without producing a shook in these islands. And It should ba remembered, too, that the pecullarstaplemauufactures of Ireland-in linen and otber fabrics -hav one of their chief outlets In the United States, so that Ulster particularly was liable to be severely affected by the American con- alsion. We are glad, therefore, to learn that even In the northern province rmercantile firms have yet scarcely been affected. The advance of discounts to nine per cent. (a rate, we believe, altogether anprecedented in the history of banking) is obviously intended as a protective measure for the public as well as the banks; bat necessarilv it operates hith exceeding severity upon the commeicial classes, and indeed npon the general community. Even in Dublin, where tnere has long been a total absence of specnlative business, and where credit, therefore, is thoroughly sound and payments have beetn made wfith singullar punc- tuality, this nine per cent., wvhich is now the rate for first-i class and short-dated b'lls, mus' he felt as a seriouls impediument to mercantile enterprise."

QUAnisy AC0JDEST.-A frightf il accident, resulting in the death of six Dersons and serious injury to two others, occurred on t riday afternoon at the quarries of Cloddfa'r S6o, in tbo Vale of Nantlle, about nine miles from Carnarvon. A temporary cessation of work had taken place, owing to an accldent to the pston rod of the engine, andthequarrymen, aboutl4in number, had congragatedtogether atithebotton of the deephollow topias the timeinconversation They had not baen long there when they heard the well-known and dreaded cryof "Beware !"npon which they instantly ran to the cabin constructed for the safety of those at wtrk when danger is expected. Unhappily this proved the worst spot they could have chosen. A huge rock, about 30 tons in welhht, fell in one miss from a height of' 50 yards, and, strikng sgainst the ledges of store in its descent, brAke into a thousand pieces, wbich bounded with tremendous force to the ground, kiUling three of the men on thespot, and mortallyinring thrcc ttSers. One of the latter i died almost imtrnediatcly, another while being carried home, and the third In about eight hours after the catastrol Ie. The narnes of the deceased are William Roberts, %obni Parry, Hlugh Prichaid, Joseph Wilams, and two men i named Jones. The bodies presented an awful spectacle, being fearfully crushed and lacerated. William Roberts, under the inipression that the rock above his head was falling, rushed headlong into the danger, trying to drag with him another man, who only escaped by leaving pert of his waistcoat in his hands. The injured mien, though severely hurt, are progressing favourably. The accident is supposed to have arisen from the adhesiver.ess of the reck being affected by the lodgment of Nvater ia a levl joint, whloh runs to an angular point at the bottom, thus making the amass top-heavy.

TRB PBESS. IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TL)s. Sir,-As I have had experlence of the newspaper press both in India and ERngland, my countrymen will perhaps receive with indulgence a few observations which I shall submit to them on the subject. W"'hen Lord Wifliam Bentinck took charge of the government of India, public discussion had been entirely stifled by the severe measures which had been taken against the press during his predecessor'" administration. This stagnation was first interrupted by a notice issued by Lord William, invlting suggestions from any quarter for the Improvement of public measures and the develoDment of the resources of the country; and upon this followed a remarkable series of letters in the newspapers by the late Hon. Frederick Shore, in which every subject of public interest was discussed lwith entire freedom and with no ordinary severity. I well remember the feeling of strangenesr and surprise with which the Snotice" was regarded, so inconsistent was it with the preceding state of things; and, as for Mr. Shore's letters,ax one surpassed another in audacious exposure of the faults of our system, people wondered that he was not visited with some signal mark of the displeasure of the Governmant. Other writers followed, and Lord William gave his countenance and assistance by furnishing valuable information from authentic public sources. The experiment was fairly worked out during his time, and what Lord Metcalfe did was only to give legal sanetion to it. It was no slight guarantee for the propriety of the change that i,t was the joint work of an English stateaman remarkable for public spirit and breadth of view, and an Indian statesman who was unsurpass for varied experience of the country, and for the sober, common-sense, conservative manner in which he dealt with the subjects which came before him. After this came two notifications of opposite tenourin the Caluttta Gazette. The first was issued by Lord Auckland for the purpose of revoking an order which had been passed in 1826, probibiting public servants from being connected with newspapers as editors or proprietors:- "1 NOTIFICATION. " Political Department, June 28, 184L "With reference to a notfficat*in from the General Department of the 11th of May, 1826, the Governor-General in Council is plea3ed to notify that, by Paragraph 3 of a letter of the Ron. the Court of Dirootors In the Political Department, dated April 21 (No. 9 of 1841), the existing prohibition against the connexion of their servants with the public newspapers has been revoked, subiect to the re. straints imposed upon military offiicers by the rules of the service. "By order of the Right Hon. the Governor-General of India in Council, "T. H. MADDOCK, Secret to Govermment." The second was issued by Lord enborough:- " NoTmicATioli u "Fort William, Foreign Department, Aug. 30, 1843. Some mioiocoeption appearing to exit with respect to the power which officers of both services have over the doouments and papers which oome into their possession officially, the Governor-General in Council deems it expedient to notify that such documents and papers are in no case to be made public or communicated to individuals without the previous consent of the Government, to which alone they beong. "The offlcer in po"session of such documents and papers can only legitimately use them for the furtherance of the public service in the dischrrge of his official duty, and it is to be understood that the same rule which applies to docaments and papers applies to information of which officers may become possessed officially. " By order of the R"ight Hon. the G-overnor-General of lndia in Council, " J. TH03IASON, Secretary to the Government of Indla" Public officers were thus efectually prevented from assisting in the discusions which had previously taken place in the newspapers upon every subject of public interest, for their means of doing so were entirely dependent upon Iformation acquired in the manner contemplated in this noticethat is, in the disecharge of their duties as public officers. No prosecution has been instituted by the Government of India against the press, either for sedition or for any other offence, since it was liberated by Lord Metealfe; and the newspapers in the native languages have been so completely neglected that, except through some rare accident, their contents have been entirely unknown.* Freedom of the prees in British India i inevitable. We could not hold the country with advantage either to ourselves or to the natives, even if we could bold it at all, unless Englishmen not in the service of the Government went thither in considerable numbers to trade and exercise their professions; and Englishmen are not disposed to embark their fortunes in a country in which they are debarred from the free expresion of their opinions. They can bear the suspension of their Parliamentary privileges, but the freedom of discussion through the press is asrecessary to them as the air they breathe. It is a habit which they cannot cast off, and it is felt by them to be a practical security against abuse, and t practical means of influencing public measures which goes a great way towards supplying the place even of a free Parliament. The newspaper press of the British dependencies is dovetailed with the British press. The affairs of India are discussed with the utmost freedom in this country, and it would be iatolerable if Englishmen in India were not permitted to see what is said about them and their affairs at home. The native Akhbars answeringto the " Newsletters" which preceded the establishment of the newspaper press in England, also have an important bearing upon the subject. Akhbarnuvees, or newswriters, exercise their profession in the great indian cities, and regularly supply their employers with information of what is passing, and with comments upon it. There were 20 or 30 at Delhi,+ and even the Residency Akhbarnuvees seasoned his daily gazette with caustic remarks upon the proceedings of the authorities. Besides this are the "Bazar Letters," I and their offspring the Bazar reports, making together a popular system of intelligence, which is not to be despised. The manner in which the Bazar reports often anticipate the English news is a matter of observation to this day. This native system can neither be suspended nor held in check; and our choice, therefore, really is between a newspaper press on the English footing, which may be made amenable to law and is likely gradually to improve, and a native machinery, which must always be conducted by a very inferior set of people acting under no sort of responsibility. The great improvements which have been made in the Indian post-offlice arrangements of late years, and the reduction of the rates of postage, have given increased facilities to the conveyance of native intelligence. The feeedom of the press in British India is also, on the whole, highly beneficial. In the absence of a Representatve Assembly, for which India is at present totally unfit, there is no other medium through which ab'uses can be brought to light and the sense of the community be taL-en on matters of general interest. There cannot be a greater evil than that public officers should be exempted from the control of public opinion. In Lord William Bentinck's, Lord Metoalfe's, and Lord Auckland's time the press was held in wholesome respect by the public functionaries, even at the most remote stations, and it acted as a sort of moral preventive police, furnishing in a fair degree, in reference to the whole governing body, an answer to the question "1 Quis custodiet ipsos Ceustodes ?" The influence of the newspaper press in diffusing useful information and ineulcating correct views was still more remarkable, and it may safely be said that t.here w-as not a single good public measure which was not powerfully aided by it. As regards the native press, some newspapers were conductei in a creditable manner in the English language by and for the natives who had received an English educatiun; others were published in the native languages by the missionaries; and i' must not be supposed that the remainder, which were written by nstives in the native languages, did nothing but preach sedition. Their standard both of intelligence and morality was, no doubt, below that of the Ei;glish -newspapers; but they opened the minds of the natives to an interest in general top;cs, and ta Uht them to think, from which everytling eole might be expected to follow, But it is alleged that there is no public in India to be guided and instructed by a free press; that the European press is in the hands of a single clasw, which has interests at variance with the rest of the eommuTbity; that this classhabitually misrepresents the measures of the Government, wbich is withheld from the possibility of defence; that a free press and the domiinion of strangers are incompatible, because it must always be the first dut.y of a free press to deliver the countmy from a foreign yoke: and IdFor a more detmiled account of the recent history of the Indin pesssee is hares Teveyans exaination on that subject befopre th Indian Committec of the House of LordE, f~ The intelligence of tbe {aU of Delhi received by last ynail came from the DelJhi Al b8rnu:yece of t:he Jeypoor that free discussion is especially to be dreaded ia reference to the native army, because an army precedes the ret of the people in the power of combined action, wvhile it lags behind them i general education and intelligence. The European society in India is small, but it is extremely influential. It is the governing body, and, whether the rulers of a country are 10,000 or 10,000,000 it is of the highest consequence. that they should take a correct view of its interests and of their own in connexion with it. The abolition of the trausit duties and the moderate 30 years' Eettlement of the land revenue of the NorthWestern Provinces were greatly promoted by the public discussion of those subjects in Lord William Bentinck's time.; but freedom of trade and security of property were not the worse for having been obtained by an appeal to a few score of public officers who had been taught the true principles of jurisprudence and political economy under MIakintosh and Malthus. The Europeans are separated by wide intervals, but they are united by a common interest and a common intelligence; and a free press is the only institution whereby each person can bring his information and reason into the common stock, so that, according to the Coruiish motto, it may be ". one and all," each for all and aU for each. This was felt so strongly in the good days of the press in India that we used to call it the Parliament of the Press, because, although the machinery was different, the substantial benefits of a Parliament were in a great - degree obtained. The Earopeans, however, wiU now become much more numerous. The re-establishment of tranquillity will be followed by an extensive resort of persons of the profesional and commercial classes to India; and, as the mesures in progress fcr the improvement of the army open its ranks to better educated and more intelligentmen, the greatly increased European force will furnish a good proportion of aspirants, for the profits and honours of civil life. Lastly, if we turn to the natives, we find a public of 200,000,000 to be gaided and instructed by a free preas. They wil be operated upon slowly by it, but the lever is too powerful to be neglected by those who desire the elevation of this great people. It is true that the newspaper press at the Indian Presidencies is for the most part in the hands of the class which has always advocated one administration of criminaljustice (if it could be so called) for Europeans and another for natives, and now urges the intrcduction of the English language and English lawyers into aU the Indian courts, and the forimation of a Legislative Assembly in which the English only would be represented; and that frequent depreciation of the Government and its officers is one of the means used to this end. It is also true that the Government abstains from defending itself by the ordinary and legitimate means of expl.onation and arguraent. This was not always so. During the long honeymoon of the Indian press under Bentinck, MIetealfe, and Auckland, the Government steadily held its own. In knowledge of the country, habit of English composition, and identification of their interests with those of the natives, the officers of the Government were as ten to one to the rest of the European community, and they easily maintained the field against all comers. Hard hits were occasionally exchanged, but it was a fair game, and both par'ies rejoiced in the wholesome exercise. The Goverment maintained a dignified neutrality, and, although full advantage was taken of the manner in which public questions of all kinds were prepared and worked out by the press before a decision was taken upon them, there was no disposition either to yield to dictation or to be provoked to violence. This state of things continued until the evil times which commenced with the Affghan war. Lord Ellenborough's general order, and the disposition which was shown to place a strict interpretation upon it, effectually restrained the pens of the Company's servants, and the press at the Presidencies was left in the hands of the class of English society above described. From the king to the coalheaver we aU want looking after. It is not good for any of us to be left to our own devices. The consequences that would ensue if the high Tories or ultra-Radicals had entirely their own way in England give only a faint idea of the state of things in BengaL The shepherds stood aloof while the British lion ranged at pleasure over the pasture. But, although silent, tl-e shepherds were not indifferent. Thev were filled with indignation, and were only watching an opportunity of rendering the lion harmless. Bat, to drop metaphor, if the ultra-English party had their own way, an oligarchy would be established in India, compared with which the domination of the Normans in England and of the Orangemen in Ireland was child's play, and quick and terrible would be the reaction. The interests of this class, therefore are not really at variance with those of the rest of the community; but it is hard for individuals to resist the temptation of present power and present gan, and shortsighted views are acted upon. On the other hand, the position of the Government Is most unfortunate. "One story is good tiU another is told ;" but in this case not one,but thousands of stories are told for a series of years together with the same bias, the same colouring, the same aim againzt the Government. It is useless to say, "' Thrice is he armed who has his quarrel just." No Government could stand such pounding, and kicking, and bedaubing, and besmearing as this for a period as long as the memory of middle-aged men can go back. People in general-and especially our Indian fellow-subjects, who have no notion of possessing power without exercising it-do not believe in such superhuman meekness. The Government of India, therefore, truly says that it is brought into contempt. Why it submits to be pilloried in this manner I never could discover. The only lntelligible reason I have ever heard is that, being responsible, not to the small European community of Calcutta, but to the Court of Directors and to the Government and Parliament of England, they cannot deliver themselves on the spot. But if reasons are good for passing important public measures, surely they will bear being mentioned in the country which is primarily and chiefly affected by them. If the opposition of the local English community is annoying and damaging, it is worth while to neutralize it, or at least to temper it and hold it in check, by furnishing explanations which are likely to be asented to by every impartial person. Great disquiet was caused in Rajpootana by a paragraph which went the round of the newspapers, that It was Intended to annex the Rxjpoot States. If this had been contradicted, and the reasons had been explained which must always make it our policy to protect the independence of these States, our Raipoot friends would have been relieved from their fears, and new motives would have been suggested to thera for remaining steady to their allegiance. As the newspaper press at the Presidencies is rarely conducted by persons who have had practical experience of the interior of India, its faults are owing in a treater degree than is generaUy supposed to ignorance of facts and unconsciousness of the mischievous tendency of much that is put forth with an air of authority. The conductors of the Anglo-Indian press would be grateful for correct information. T'hey must feel that it would increase their useful, and therefore just, influence. The institution of the British Indian free press ougna either to be accepted, with its appropriate compensations and safeguards, or to be rejected; but of late years neither one thing nor the other has been done. Persons commonly argue this question as if there were no alternative between a licentious free press, an.d a press bound hand and foot at the feet of the authorities and mado to speak only what they desire, and the consequence is, that after a long eourse of neglect of the proper diet and treatment, fever has supervened and severe remedies have been applied. But there is a golden mean in this as in other things. Besides unrestricted license ard the absence of all freedom, there is a third condition, which is a well regulated freedom. The expedient dear to the ordinary official mind is the establishment of a semi-official inewspaper-a Government organ, as it is usually called. This was tried in the early dark period of the Anglo-Indian press, when a paper called the Johin Budl wal set up to defend Lord Amherst's Government. The commonest k-nowledge of human nature ought wo have prevented this mistake. All the other game-chicken fell upon the Government fightingcock, and there was no peace till he was deprived of his official obaracter. Reaon and experience recommend a retirn to the practice of the statesman who founded the Indi-an free press, which was to have no favourites among thce local newspapers, and to permit everybody who 'aad anything to say to wi-ito to them. If this '2Course were consistently followed,there would rarely be any oocasion for the Governmaent to defend itse.f, every topic would bSlve it,$ ObJectoil Midt dQfondJrs, aid, as the Government would not necessarily be in a state of antagonism with any cIau, there would be no heat except what would naturally arise out of the sulb. jects of discussion. Sedition ought, of course, to be severely punished, and the knife has been so near our throats that no difliculty is to be expected in obtaining convictions. The native press will require more particular attention; and we must not a second time utterly neglect it through a long series of years, and then come down upon it in great -wrath because it had indulged in the license permitted to it. Every copy of every native newspaper ahould be examined by officers appointed for the purpose ; and while friendly advice andc warning should not be spared in reference to errors of ignorance or inadvertence, deliberate attempts to promote disaffection ought to be subjected to due process of law. It may, however, be hoped that, now that the conreientious Christian people of this country have becomc aware of the existence of such a field of influence as the native newspaper press, they will apply the superior means at their disposal to the cultivation of it, so that it may produce somethiDg better in future than an abundant crop of noxious weeds. The next standing objection is that a free press and the dominion of strangers are incompatible, because it must always be the duty of a free press to deliver the country from a foreign yolke. I meet thli by a, direct "negatur." The first duty of a free press is to promote the public good, and if thls can be 'worked out best under the protection of a foreign Government, it is the duty of the prefsto support and ausist that Government. If there had been a free press in this island at the time of- the Romans, the " Groans of the Britons," that famous petition wherein they besought the Emperor not to withdraw his .legions, would have found expression in it. Our ancestors did not miore sincerely deprecate the removal of that Power under the shadow of wbich they were learning to take their place with safety and credit among the uations of the earth, than those natives of India who have had their minds opened to our civilization would be filled with dismay at the prospect of the destruction of our Government. No class has more uniformly stood by us in these troubles than the Anglicized Bengalees and other natives; and well they might, for they could expect no mercy from a pure Brahminical or Mahomedan rygime. At Delhi everybody who spoke English was searched out and put to death. At Cawnpore and elsewhere the -' Baboos" were considered proper subjects of plunder and persecution. The safety and success of our Indian empire will be in proportion to the increase of this class, and to the degree in which it is Ieavened by Christian principles. The circumstances of this outbreak furnish strong presumptive evidence that some progress has been made, and when our rnastery shal have been established as it never yet has been, by this desperate struggle vith our own army, and by the civil and military reorganization consequent upon it, and the people of this country bhall have begun to act upon their newly-awakened sense of duty towards India, the development of English civilization among the natives of India Will proceed in a greatly accelerated ratio. The Romana made Gaul, and Spain, and Africa helpful and powerful members of their body politic, and shaU we be less successful with Iudia notwithstanding the advantage of Christipaity aud of 1,800 years' additional experience of human affairs ? The last objection usually urged is that a free press Is incompatible with a native army. Not only this, but almost every other improvement was incompatible with a native army like the late Bengal army; but the case will be altered when the native army Is auxiliary instead of principal-is recruited from all castes and all parts of the country, Instead of from the high and privileged castes and fromn one part of the country only, and when the other arranigements described in a previoas letter are made by which the native army may be held safely in hand. A native army so regulated would be quite compatible with a native press watched, and checked, 2nd improved, and influenced for good in the manner I have recommended. But we must not expect too much. Those who criticize the newspaper press In this country often appear to forget that it is a human institution, and as such entitled to the allowance which ought always to be made for human infirmity. Everything has a bad as well as a good side; and if the good decidedly preponderates, we ought for its sake to tolerate the contingent evil. If those who pronounce harsh judgments upon the press had to provide every morning four columns of remarks upon the most exciting topics of the day, and to guide and influence the men who are capable of writing such essays as we d'ily read in The Times and other newspapers, they would have more sympathy for occasional errors and inadvertenc;es. And yet we may well be proud of our newspaper press, and earnestly desire that its benefits may be extended to the glorious Eastern empire which has been intruated to us. The forbearance, the moderation, the prevailing absence of mere personal and private iuaputations on the part of the English press under circumstances of great difficulty and temptation are deserving of all praise; and when this line is for a moment departed from, it can always be set right by a letter to The Times, or an article in that or some other paper. Under all,the circumstances, the influence of the English press during the Parliamentary recess furnishes as satisfactory a model as we could expect to have for the operation of the Indian press.

THE CAPE REINFORCEMENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-Lord VEgin has with eharacteristio judgment directed that aU the force sent out for the support of his negotiations should bo plAced at the disposal of the Governor-General of India. But, pray, observe the contrast here. We have 11 regiments besides the Cape Corps and German Legion. One of these regiments, the S9tb, is under orders for New Zealand, and anotber, the 95th, is on its wayfrom England to relieve it. The Governor has altered the destination of tho 89th from New Zoeland to India, and the 95th whenever It may arrive is to follow it, and this is alL He hastherefore magnanimously left himself with only 10 regiments, the Cape Corps, and the German Legion. With respect to any imminent danger making the retention of this large force necessary, I need but mention that subcriptions are actuaUy being raised in Graham's Town for the relief of the Caffres, who are dying by hundreds of starvation and disease. But tho Governor, in spite of the pressing requisitions of the Indian Governors, has not the courage to reduce his force - a force much larger than has ever been in the colony before,-but retains it, with Lord Elgin's example staring him in the face. It reminds one of the doctor who makes out his pattent to be as ill as possible to get the greater credit for the cure. If Sir George Grey were to let five of his regiments go to India, and no Caffre outbreak ensue, the world might accuse the doctor of having made too much of his case. We suppose here that our Indian empire is in peril, and the question occars, What is the value of this colony in that case? Run everyriskhere sooner than that any should be run there. I am, Sir.

TO TIC EDITOR OF THE TIJES. Slr,-I am a very foolish person as evorybody knows, for all the world have read Litle Dorrit. " I want to know" why people who are too clever to be in my office, and who build big ships which won't go into the water, don't treat them as my nurse used to treat me when I was little. 1 would not go into the water, and when the nurse tried to put me in I roared and soratched her, so sbe put me in a tub and poured the water over me. Why don't clever men make big ships in big holes and let the water in -when the ships are finished instead of trying to make the ships travel on railroads? Surely one big hole wonld do for moany big ships one after anotber, and would cost less than all the wonderful things about the Leviathan, which I cau never hope to understand, but which must; be useless after the launch if not so before it.

THE AT2ANTIC T2LEGBAP1. The long and mpat tedious prooess of winding tDe eaa* mous length of cable from out the holds of the Agatemssoa aDd the Niagara has besn completed, and the Atlanti telegraph, like a monster snake, is about to hybernate for 'he winter at Plymouth, in the Keyham.yard. A large shed has here been specially built for its teeption; Is is 120 feet by 50 wide, and divided into four water-tight comportments; so that the perfect insdation of the whole length can be tebSted under water whenever it may be deemed advisable. The Agamemnosn will go into harbour and the Nispra hs returted to America, where varlous alterations suggested by the experience of the late attempt viU be made in her internal fittings, that no mechanical aids or conveniences may be wanting to the proper accommodation and payiAg out of her portion of the coil. It is expected that she wil returit to this cotntry iu the early part of next year, again to bear her part in tho groat undertaking under better auspices, and, we most sincerely trust, with better reults. In the meintime, during the whole of the winter. M1r. Whitehouse, the chief electrician of the company, Will be engaged in a varioty of experiments of the moat interesting nature upon the cable. Not only willthesebe directed to asertain its general electric czpabilities, but the rato at which each signil can be transmitted, and the effect which the different periods of the day, the temperture, and state of the atmosphere, have upon its-conductabUity. The result of these experiments nust assist in solving a number of curious electrical phenomena, of the rea causes for which very little Is at present known, and the observations of so emninent an electrici%n as Mr. Whitehouse cn3not fail tobe of value and importance to the advancement of our knowedge on the subject of voltaic currents through such a coilThe results ought to be great, for never yet had any mna such agigantic apparatus placed at his command for erperi. mentalizing as this 2,000 miles of submarine cable affords. The 300 or 400 miUes of -cable which last August were so, effeetually submerged off the west coast of Ireland still remain at the bottom of the sea. MuCh of this piece, and very possibly half of it, might have been recovered had the attempt been made at once after the return of the expedition, but now the chances in favour of the recovery of any portion worth mentioning are much diminished. Nevertheless, this 300 nsiles are notuseless, and in a scientific point of view havenot been lost or wasted, for t'he changes in the electrical condition of the wireare constantly vratched night and day, and wiU be used for the purpose of throwing additional light on the subject of terrestrial electro-magnetle camrets. Many precautions and irprovements suggested by tho first unsuccessful attempt to lay the cable will he introduced into the plan of operatlons for next year. In the first place, It will be attempted earlier.-mont likely at the endof Juneor beginning of July, so that in case of any hitch occurring there may be ample time to repair it, and still leave August open for another effort. Of course, the same description of cable will be used. for of its kind it would be dlificult, if not quite impossible, to devise a better. For a wire-covered rope it possesses in a most astonishing degree the important qualities of lightness, strength, and perfect flexibility. The expedition started with about 2,600 miles of this cable last summaer, of which about 400 have been lost. Last week the strand and closing machines of Glass and ElUiott were again set to work to make up this deficiency of 4GO miles, but in all it wiU be necessary to spin 8W0, as it has been determined not to start again with less than 3,000 miles clear. This extra amount, however, is only to meet any unusual emergencies that may arise, and not to allow for slack, as the smaller the quantity of slack payed out the safer will be the process of submerging, and the greater wil be the ease with Tthich the telegraph can afterwards be worked. But it is principally to the improvement of the paying-out maohines that the efforts of the company have been directed. Last year these machines, aided by considerable obstinacy and rashness, ruined the whole plan, and, the steed being thus effectually stolen for the pIesent, the most tremendous precautions are now being taken to bolt the stable door. The machines are being made under the special advice and directions of Mx-, Penn, Mir. Field, Mr. Ifoyd, and Ur. Everett, the chief engineer of the Niagara. Messrs. Easton and Amos have been intrusted with their manufactare, which insures all that skill and experience can effect )ntheir solid construction. With the details of the plan upon which they are to be made we are not yet acquainted further than that theygare espeoially contrived to guard against the strain on the cable caused by the sudden pitch of the vessel, and also that the break in the wheels wil be perfectly self-acting, and so made that it will be impossible to place upon it more than about one-third of the strain which the cable can safely be relied upon to bear. Instead of submerging the cable from this side of the Atlantic, It has been decided to commencea operations by uniting the ends of the two halves on board the Niagara and Agamem. non in the centre of 'the ocean, and each vessel then making the beat of its way to land. The former ship will steer to these shores, and the latter to Newfoundland. By this plan thu operation of laying the coil vill be got over in exactly one half the time which it must otherwise occupy, and we need scarcely say that anything which diminishes the time lessens the ri.k from bad -weather in exact proportion. The opponents of this plan are to be found among the deep-sea fishermen, who generally prefer the plan of laying down the cable from the New World to the Old, and who advance, among other reasons, the fact that the set of the Gulf stream is in this direction, and that it would be better for the expedition to have the current in its favour than against it. But, as we beieve the influence of the Gulf stream does not extend below 70 fathoms depth, one is at a loss to perceive how it can affect an undertaking to submerge a cable to the depth of more than 2,000 fathoms. A more reasonable objection lies in the fact that in the centre the cable must be joined, and that it hJs been determined not to join with a fivemile centre of steel wire, which would give it tenfold strength at this point. When to this deficiency we adi the fact that the lay of each piece of cable is made in a different direction, and that one portilon forms a right and the other a left-hand screw, each of which helps the other tountwist, wecannot, however reluctantly, help seeing that this joinhig in the centre is a blot in the whole schemeOf courso, a plan (according to which a heavy square weight is to be attached to the joining) has been devised to prevent the wires untwisting if possible. But a weight at this junction is a most serious danger, though we are told that the whole mistake offers so many and sucb important " advotages" that it reminds us forcibly of the plan which an inhabitant of Laputa had projected, and by which he cub cabbages better, quicker, and cheaper than by any other method, except the ordinary one of catting themnwith a. knife. So also our admiration is solicited for this blunder as turning out, after all, better and safer than any other method in which it could be done, except that of doing it properly. here eems au unusual demand just now for submarine cables, no less than five or sdi cables for different places and Governments having been lately completed. Nearly all of them have been made by Glssse and Elliott. One was for the Swedish Government; one for the Danish, to connect Denmark with Sweden. One to connect Ceylon and Colombo on the main land - and one to join Eurrachee with Calcutta. In nearly all these cases the conducting wires have been formed in the saine manner and of the same sized svires as in the case of the Atlantic Telegraph, and all of them display the same a2mirable construction as to lightness strength, and durability, more or less strongly according to their length and the depth and nature of the sea in which they are mtended to discharge their submarine duties.
PpOwroSE RESTORATION OF flAWAREN- CHURCH. -A meeting to take into oonsideration the best means to adopt for the restoration of flIavarden church (the destruction of which by an incendiary fire was lately reported in. The Times) was held in the vestry on Thursday last; the Rev. Hlexry Glynne, rector, predded. Among others who werepresent were-Sir Stephen Glynne. Lord-Lieutenant of Flimtshire; Lord Lyttelton, and the __4ht ii. W. E. Gladstone. A paper was read by one of the churchwardens, which had been signed by the Rev. E. Glyune, Sir S. Glynne. and the Rizht Ron. W. E. Gladstone, in widch they guaranteed the sum of %OOOL. towards the estimated coqt of rebuilding the church (which would be 4,0001.), provEded the parshioners agreed to raise I,000. by a rate. A resolution approviog the plan was proposed, seconded, and carried unanimously. ln seconding a resolution proposed by Archdeacon Wickham, that subscription lists be forthvith opened, MIr. Gladstone, referring to the fire, said:' The calamity we have suffered has excited a great feeling even iu remote p3rts of the country; and I can say of my own knowledge thst it has everywhere given birth to a sense of sOame that so base a crime should have been committed There are some sio3 criminals would not commit. I verily believo if you were to turn all the criminals out of Chester Castle to.morrow you would not find one among them who wcald havecondescended to burn a church in anvparish; you cannot find a motive in heaven or earth, you must go elsewhere to find a motive wh1oh could induce a man to perpetiate such an act of unkindness and cruelty to his e`Io vwcreatures, and khaine and dishonour to his God. If consolation could be derived under the calamityw hich haa,occurred. It must be from v. itnessing the mannor In vihich mon, women, and ebildren, richer and poorer, young. and old, vere bestirring thenmselves; and I would speA particularly cf the women-the old women; there w" nO stop ig them if theo had nuscle and vitality to bAsdle a b cket. I saw some standing up to their ankles in water in the cbancel, tr?ing to save tho little that wv .s flodwing along the &round and make It serviceable r.gbni. I do trust, through the operation of the spirit so unequiPocally manifested here to-day. that in 12 or I] months from this timo we shall see the church rise agai.t in renewed beauty, and with all the decency and propri:cy of the sanctuary of God to remain a tlcssslrg to everSone who is willing to tako advantage of it, both for tht )resent r.nd mnany future gene. rations." A subscripftion list was forthwith opened, the rector, Sir Stephen 01y.nne, and Mr. Gladstone heading it with oC001 each. Betven 2,900L. and 3,0001. was subseribod n- the rosom.

FORBI6ZN INTELL BN L. - FRANCE, (FROM OUt OWN CORI3POhrD1V'I. (A portion of the foUowlng *ppO&Zed in otr loond edi. lion of q.tn-Av --Il PARIS, FRIDAY, Nov. 6, 6 P.3f. The French Government have, it appears, expressed their approval of M. de Thouvenel's conduct with respect to Redwchid Pa8ha. The Russian Ambwaasbor in Paris is Invited for the 10th to Cora. piegne, but his colleagues of Turkey and Au,tri remamn atill excluded, and in all probability will remain so to the end. The PapalNuncio has not been invited, and it is sid that he also will continue an extern-why I am not awareo perhaps it is thought his Eminence would cut but a poor figure at a ehasse d courre, and would never be able to get on in a baue. It is now said that the Court will reman at Compi6gne till the lit of December if the weather continue favourable. The directors of the Bank had an audience today of the Emperor at Compibgne to propose, it is said, a duty of 3 per cent. on the exportatien of the precious metals, or to be allowed to raise the discount to 8 per cent. The proposition, I am assmred, was not acceptedL The Sidcl dwells on the imposaibility of a native rulo in India, and maintains that the speedy triumph of the English troops, which it has ever desired, is essential for the welfare of the country itself; it says:- " Our policy has not varied from the day when the revolt at Meerut first bocame known to Europe. We have desired tho triumph of Engand because, in spite of administrative imperfections, she is the most liberal nation of the West, and also because she proved herself in the great Eastern struggle the firm ally of France. Moreover, we are suffidently acquainted with the organization of Eindostan to know that the Sepoy insurrection could result in anarchy alone. The unity which England had sought to establish has been destroyed. By what could It be replaced? What organization would collect under a com mon flag Hindoos, Mahomedans, Rajpootg, Sikhs, and Mahrattas? India, once in dissolution, would fall into the hands of the Power which covets and which is alone capable of conquering it-of Russia. But in hoping for tbh success of England we never disguised her faults; we have long since been aware of the exactions and aots of injustice witnessed in India, and we hold that tho administration which is destined to succeed to the Company's rule is bound by policy and huamanity to put an end to the iniquities of the native officials. We admit, with the Univers, that the Indian revolt is one of those grand lessons which it is madness to disavow. It is very necessary to remark that the Sepoys, who have been comaparatively well treatod, ue preolsely those who seek the exterman nation of Europeans. The Ryot*, Soudras* and all the unfortunate parlahs who were beaten and pillaged by the police remain inactve; they have even afforded assistance to fugitive English families. It is, therefore, logical to conclude that the revolt has not been provoked by the vice3 of the administration. The rule of the Company is doubt. leos severe, but the na'ives are well aware that the rule of the Hindoo conqlueror would be doubly so; they consequently remain tranquiL We may conclude by inquirlng why the GazdeU de France, which is opposed to the English rule in India, does not indicate some other means of domi. nation ? And yet the GazeUe has always some pretender or other in hand." In my letter of Wednesday I mentioned that M. Gonzales Bravo had given up his post as Ambasdor In London. This, however, is not yet the ease. Anticipating that the present Government would remove him from a Court to which he should never have been sent, he wrote to say that they (the new Cabinet) might recall him, or leave him, as they thought proper, as to continue in London or to leave it wvas equally a matter of indifference to him. Nothing is yet lnown of the decision of the Govern ment, nor indeed is it of much interest to any one. The vindication, or what purports to be the vindication, of Queen Maria Christina, so eagerly expected in Madrid, has at length appeared. It is a respectable-looking pamphlet of more than ordinary bulk. It contains 155 pages of about 34 closelyprinted lines of type. It is not the work of the Queen-Mother herself-that is, her name does not appear on the title-page as the author. It is entitled " Report presented to Her Majesty Queen Maria Christina de Bourbon on that of the Commission of the Constituent Cortes of 1855 charged with the Parliamentary Inquiry relative to her Person," and the parties who have drawn up the report are Manuel Cortina, Juan Gonzales Acevedo, and Luis Diaz Perez, advocates of the Madrid bar. With reference to one very deLicate point, namely, Queen Christina?s marriage with M. Munoz, now Duke de Rianzares, the report states- " The investigations made by the Commission in order to discover the date of the second marriage of your Majesty were long, laborious, and useless, as it states. Wherefore, and with exquisite delicacy,it (the Commission) inclines to believe that It was celebrated in 1833, and that it was concealed on account of the high funotions your Majesty then filled. It inclined to this supposition because any other appeared to it more offensive, and as likely to occasion greater responsibility and eensure. It is to be deplored that this friendly design, emanating from the noble sentiment, of the members of the Parliamentary Commission, should have led them to adopt an opinion contrary to that -which they should have formed with the only data which it was their duty to collect. The Archbishop of Toledo officla'ly Informed the Commission on the 19th of July, 1855, that having received the doolaration of freedom from engagement and of consent respecting the information of witnesses, and having dispensed with the three canonical monitions, he celebrated your Majesty's marriago with Don Augustin Fernando Munoz y Sanchez, Duie de Riazares, on the 12th of October, 1844, according to the Roman ritual, of which the extracts, as well as those of the birth of the children, and the due declaration of your Majesty and your husband, being examined by him, he copied them in special registers, and deposited themi In the private archives of tho chapel." The reporters add that these facts are corroborated by the insertion in the register by the same prelate of the baptismal certificate of the Countess of Vista Alegre (one of the daughters of Maria Christina) : " To doubt the celebration of the marriage having taken place on the 12th of October, 1844, to refuse aU credence to the official declaration of tho Primate of Spain, or to suppose that for merely worldly considerations he violated the venerated precept of our re. ligion, which prohibits the repetition of the saicrament, would be rash, would be impious, and highly injurious to a legitimate successor of the Apostles. Can it be admitted that the venerable Cardinal of the Roman Church would have stained his conscience with so serious an imposture, to the injury of the country, and expose hiaself to the danger of being contradicted? And, even if so offensive a supposition be admitted, must we not also admit that the Counoil of Ministers, that Her Majesty the Queen told a falsehood, and practlsed a deceit on the whole world, by the hypocritical farce of granting the Royal permission for the solemnizatilon of a marriage solemnized several years before? The pen re. f uses to continue the examination of an hypotheds only based on rash suspicion," &o. I have glanced hurriedly over the report; but, so far as I can see, this subject is handled with much tenderness. The Conumission of the Constituent Cortes had to examine whether Queen Christina's marriage really took p lace in 1833 for the simple reason that, It if did, she must have received her large allowance as Regent and guardian of her daughters by King Ferdinand without havlng any right to it ; in other words, that she must have defrauded the Spanish Treasury, as she could only continue in those functionrs so long as she remained unmarried. Of the fact of her relation with Fer- nanio Munoz there was not a doubt; arid the Commission, from a feeling of delicacy, preferred supposing that she had been married secretly a month or so after King Ferdinand's death, rather than fixing the'date in 1844. They were unwilling to proclaim that Queen Christina could have forgotten her duties and her selfrespect at a moment so crltical for her daughter's crown, while civil war was rau'lng in the land. They preferred supposing a mariage to supposing anything worse. M. Cortina and his brother reporters conclude their part of the subject by assuring Her Majesty that " she has abundantly complied with th3 laws of God and man, without shrinking from the sacrifice which all would not have courage enough to make In the position Her Majesty oeupied." M. Cortina's allusion to the impossibility of the SDanish Government or of Queen Isabella being capable of stating what was not true will, perhaps, cause Spaniards who know them to smile. Fhe truth is, Queen Christina would have a large sum of money to refund to the Spanish Treasury if her marriage dated from 1833, and she escapes that excruciating alternative by a sacrifice of, to any other woman, a still more painful and humiliating kdnd.

Count Orloff, one of the diplomatists who represented the Emperor of Rusia at the Paris Congress, is among the guests at Compoigne, where festivities are at the highest, and where, it is said, a grand ball will be given by the Emperor before their close. It was rumoured that the Court would remain there till the 30th, instead of the 20th of November, if the weather continued fine. Whether this be the case or not, it Is certain that a good deal of murmuring is heard that the Imrneral Court should be so much occupied In hunting, feasting, and dancing during the present severe commercial crisis. The same fault was committed last year, and it would be as well not to repeat it. Two French medical men have just left for I:sbon, with the view of studying the nature of the pesti. lence which haa been so long desolating that city The ceremony of military degradation took plce yesterday morning atthe Ecole Militaire in presence of detachments from the different regiments in garrison in Paris. Nine men condemned were present to hear their sentences read. The formalities observed on this occasion were those prescribed by the new military code. Among the men were an artilleryman, a light cavalry soldier, and a foot chaseur, who were declared to be unworthy of any longer bearing arms, and all their military insig were stripped from them. According tothe new code, when an officer has to undergo degradation his sword is broken and thrown at his feet. For all ranks, degradation entails the privation of rank and of wearing any uniform, absolute incapacity to serve in any way in the army, and loss of all rights acquired by previous services. It is also accompanied by imprisonment, the term of which is fixed by the Court, and the maximum of which is five years. The directors of the Hackney Carriage Company the day before yesterday made three experiments with a new time and distance meter invented by Van Hecke. The first was from the depOt of carriages in the Rue St. Honor6 to the office of the company in the Rue de RivolL The distance was 1,400 metres, and the time employed was 7i minutes, being at the rate of 11,280 metres (seven mUes) an hour. The second was from the office of the company to the Rue du Croissant-distance 1,145 metres, time six minutes, rate 11,460 metres an hour. The third was from the Rue du Croissant to the railway station at the Porte Maillot -distance 5,300 metres, time 25 minutes, rate 12,720 metres (about eight mniles). The meter is in the form of a email cabe from 6 to 7 centimetres square, and the application is so simple and easy that it only requires a minute to fix or remove it. The one experimented with was not completed, but notwithstandirg worked with surprising regularity and precision. This instrument will give the public an exact idea of the distance run over in a given time, and consequently of the speed obtained in exchange for the money paid. To the directors it furnishes an infallible means of control as to the distances gone over in the course of the day; it will also enable them to detect when coachmen have overdriven their horses, and will thus cause a saving to the company inthe wear and tear of their horses. Many persons keeping private carriages wi also find an advantage in adopting the use of one of these meters, as it will enable them to detect when their coachmen use their horses and carriages for their own profit.

The news of the fall of Delhi has caused the lveliest feelings of satisfaction here, where, as I have shown you on former occasions, the warmest aspirations are entertained for England's prompt victory over the rebellious soldiery of the native army. This important fact of the capture of the stronghold of the mutineers, conferring, as it doas, additional certalnty on the prospects of a speedy suppression of the mutiny,'has reducedto within very narrow limits the small group of timid persons here who, insufficiently acquainted with what Englishmen are capable of doing when once put to it, had admitted the doubt into their minds as to whether England would indeed eventually be victorious in the struggle. The succes has been attained without even waiting for rein. forcements from home, much less with the aid of foreign nations. But, while this is a double souree of satisfaction to every Englishman, it need not exclude a warm feeling of gratificatlon on the part of our countrymen to know that tbroughout Germany, and especially in this country, the whole progress of the contest has been watched with the Liveliest interest an(d sympathy, and that the Prusian army, which contains many fine spirits cha§ng at nacton, nas on many occasions testified its loniing to have an opportunity of co-operating with Her MIajesty's forces on that field. Of the various organs of the press the MVinisterial Zeit5 has been among the most prominent in disseminating corrt views, and expressing the sympathies felt byall classes of the peoplejon this subject. The officialPretssische (10x respondenz has, conformably to its character, refrained from anyexpression of eeling the matter, but has, on the other hand, contributed a series of well-written and correct papers onthe diferent portions of the East Indies now the scene of such In. teresting events, the Zeit has, however, assumed a warmer tone, and commenced its campaign by taking up the cudgels even against such organs of the British press as either on the one hand depreciated the enormous value of India to England, or, on the other, indulged In an iLvidious exaggeration of the English maladministration of that country, whether under the auspices of the Company, or, as more recently, under the rule of the British Government, One of the recent publications of the English press on which the Zeit has bestowed its animadversions on account of the spirit in which it is written (wbile recommending its perusal for the sake of the information it contains) is General Briggs's, from the pages of which, however, it extracts honey enough to deprive its sting of all venomous influence. It has shown from that work itself how England, while evincing a certain tendernes for the religious persuasions of the Hindoos, has nevertheless put an end to the fearful cruelties *lth which the exercise of their religion was at- tended; human sacrifices, the self-i molation of wRidows, the marragr of children, rhich from the mortality attendant on childhood leaves so many widows from their earliest youth to observe a lifelong celibacy, havei all been abelishedv Schoo's have been established for the native children even of the female sex. Hospitals and schools of medicine have been opened, works of irrigation and canals have been constructed, the Indus and the Ganges covered with ateam flotillas, and the land intersected with well-kept higTroads 'hese and the Introduction of postal and telegraphic communications the Zeit enumeratestoshow atlength- "1 How active the Brltons have been in East India, and that they have laboured not only for themselves and for th ' military maintenance of their conqueAt but also for the spread of civilization in the East." In another series of articles which the Zeit has devoted to the consideration of a work that has excited a good deal of interest here (Captain Orich'* Letter to Lord W. on the Military Mutiny in India, its Causes and Consequences) it describes the characteriatics of the two parties In the English press: - " On the one side a warm 3nd enthusdatia sympathy for thecauseof British poweras thecbampionof Chiinity and cviization in the far off regions of Asia; on the other side a captioug criticizng of the causes of the prewent disorder with an obvious inclination to pass severe judgment on the deficiencies of British administration and the faults of English policy.e And adds:- " It need not mrprise us to fid that In Germany, and - partioularly in Prussia, the former tone of feeling predomintes. Prussia is so intimately bound up with England by the affinity of blood and religious faith that It quivers sympathetically with every gah that peetrates the flesh of British power, she so sncerely appreciates the worldmission of tho British race that, in spite of the many mor lifications she has received from the polites stll dominan on the banks of the Thames, her spathies are irreisitibly devoted to the suocess of the British arms." Herr Von OrlHch, the author of the work abovementioned, was many years adjutant to Sir Charles Napier in India, aud has further acquired an honourable name for himselfin the field of historical, political, and military literature snce his return from that country in 1843. The book itself is well worth the perusal of all those who value the opinions of a clear-headed,impartial man, who has had ample opportunities for acquiring knowledge of his subject and maturing his judgment, and who is not led astray by any bias of political partisanship. Among the numerous pasages that might be quoted as Bpecially deserving of notice, we find one containing the communication the author made to Sir lenry Herdinge, -at the time Secretary at War, at the latter's request for his opinion with regard to the British military force then (1843) in India. He pointed oult then- " That the Eoropean military force wa much too small, and that with the great probable increae of territory grave dangers would arise from this cause I stated that double the present force would hardly suffice. I mentioned also my conviction that the entire force of native regular cavalry should be abolished by degrees, nd only irregular native cavalry be retained; and also that no natives shoull be admitted to the artillery servioe." The civil administration of the English in India meets with very lenient criticism at the hands of Herr Von Orlich, who seems more inclined to attribute the various defects and deficiencies of this system to the encroachments, the arbitrary violence, and the venality of the native civil employes; he points out the disunion that hax always existed between the military and civil services, which obey two opposite tendencies, and the license with which the native press has always been permitted to dwell upon and exaggerate every blot on the escocheon of the British Government. As regards the manner In which the Government has fulfilled its mission of civilization he says:D "The Indian Government has within the last 20 year3lone incrediblymuch for school education, but always with the precaution of keeping Christlian taching, as contained n the Bible and the latter itself, out of its system. The resWIt ha been that the youth of India which have participatod in this instruction have grown up into Atheism, or a few years nfter completing their school studies have relapsed sto disgusting Idolatry, and thus produced a ' Young India, that even its own members are revolted at. . . . . By tar too much protection has been accorded to the abominable idolatry of the Eandoos. and Mahomedars. While refraluing from offending their religions by any act of violence, lt was the duty of the ruling Power simply to tolerate them. From the moment the Indian Government set to work to make the population susceptible of the blemings of civilized life it should have openly laid down Chistianity s it; basis." Another work that by good chance was being published just as affairs in India attained their climax of interest-viz., Prince Waldemar' s* Travels in India in 1844-6-has tended more than any other literary prodaction to warml the Prussian fee7ings of sympathy-I may almost say participation-with the struggles of our countrymen in India. It is not so much the artistlcal illustrations of the work, the contributions to science, or the expressions of the Prince's own impresSiOnS of India, that rivet the attention of the Prussian reader; it is rather his descriptions of Delhi and other points of present interest, the plans of various battles fought by L*ord Gough and Lord Hardinge agtalnst the Sikhs In their campaign on the Sutlej; but most of all the narrative of his own participation in the battle s of Moodkee, Feroze shahs and Feroze - pore. At the former he had put himself and his suite at the disposition of Lord THardinge and kord Gough, was one of the first to mount and meet the attack of the enemy, and did not leave Lord Hiardinge'saside even when the latter headed a bayonet attack on the hostile batteries. It was on the 21st of December, 1845, that the Prince's body physl. clan, Dr. Eoffimeister, was killed at his side by a discharge of grape that riddled both rider and horse, and stretched both at once dead on the field. The second day at Ferozeshah the Prince was prohibited from witnessing by the special command of Lordilardinge, who, taking the ex;treme odds against the Britis force into consideration, felt it his duty to the Rloyal family of Prussia to forbid the Prince's appearance on the field. He, however, joined the army at Ferozepore, and was present again at the affair of FRebruary 10, 1846. The Prince's intrepidity and admirable conduct on these occasions were so warmly testified to by the thenSirEHenry Hfardinge and SirEHughGough that on his return homne he was promoted to the rank of Major-General, and received the Order pour le mirite, Queen Victoria conferred on him the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and the East India Company presented him with a splendid sword as a testimonial of its respect. The two very beautiful 12-pounders that the Company also presented to him, as trophies taken from the Sikhs in that campaign, long formed an interesting object in the Zeughvaus, but have been subsequently placed in front of the Schloss at FPischbach, where the Prince died shortly after his return home. The collections of objects of natural history which the Prince brought home with him from India and all the tent equipage he had in use there form a most attractive portion of a new museum now forming in connexion with the well-krnown Museum of Pictures and Sculpture in B3erlin. From the above you will acquire the conviction that expressions of sympathy with us on the part of this nation are not mere emptyphrases,for even the Kreuz Zeitungpeople, asIlatelyshowed, whilenot ooncealing their satisfaction at the Almighty having visited theEnglishpowerwiththis 3udgment for havingopposedtheambitiousplansof thelrformerpatron, Rumsia, give in their faint adhesion to the general desire, for a speedy and successful result to our present struggles in India. An expression of sympathy of a more practical kind than any press demonstration I find in a letter that has been put into my hands, con- taining an offer from a gentleman in a good social position in this country,-a married man, childless, and a Protestant,-to receive and adopt an orphan child of English parents who may have been murdered in India, or the child of parents who may have lost their fortune in the late troubles there. The only features in the offer that detract from its disinterestedness are the stipulations made that the child shall not only be free from aU vicious propensities, but shall also be pretty, well bred, and of good family. TUIRKEY. (EmOss OIJB OWN CORRE:PONDl)T.) CONSTANTINOPLE, Ocr. 28. Yesterday a Kikiab, or great Ministerial Council, was held at the Palace, at which the Sultan himself attended. This is custoznary at the beginning of every new Administration, and its object is to settle, as it were, the programme of the Ministry. In most cases this is little more than a matter of iorm, but on this occasion something more was expected, as the Imperial order naming Redschid Graui Vizier confers special powers upon him in the formation of the Ministry. This extraordinary power is motiV6 by the uatisfactory state into which the different departments have fallen owing to the isolated action of each Minister. If one had not to apprehend that the very power which conferred this authority on the new Grand Vizier will curtail it later, there would be no small cause for satisfaction, for the greatest difficulty of every head of the Cabinet is to control the action of the Ministers. Usually they act rather a la BashiBazouk, each of them fighting on his own hook, having his own personal policy and his own political sympathies and antipathies. No firm and aystematic policy Is pousible under these circumstances, and this would be more necessary now than ever. With the exception of the question of the Principalities, no diplomatic eomplications seem likely to ocepr; the energy of the new Ministry may therefore be turned on internal affairs, which have been hitherto al but overlooked. And nothing can be done here, except by a strong united action; for it is not sufficient to make new regulations ; the chief thing is to carry them into effect, and it is in this that all the successive Administrations have failed. There is not a single branch of administration that does not require reform, but in even the smallest change so many powerful interests are involved that nobody dares to touch them. The financial question is of course at the head of all, as the most urgent and the most difficult. I wrote to you in my last thlst several projects for improving the financial position of the country are on the tap2s,-consolldation of the debts, now taxes, and other conirivances, all of which have their advantages, perhaps, but none of which, according to my opinion, promise much in the present state of affairx. The root of the evil is the total want of confidence in the Government. It exists in the country as well as abroad, and forces the Government to continually make sacrifices to meet the emergency of the moment. It would require an entire change of system during a number of years to restore confidence. It is this want of confidence which gives to the Intitution of a national bank in this country a special character. Its mission must be to be the mediator between the Government and the distrustful public. If the Government now came forward with a loan for the regulation of its finances, there would be very little chance of getting it even on the most onerous conditions, for who would trust to the regular payment of the interest and to its promise of faithfully adhering to the conditions ? But if there was a bank with a considerable capital acting as the agent of the Government, through whom all the payments would have to be made, the bank, provided it was formed on a solid and trustworthy basis, would be a guarantee for the honesty of the Government. Ithink, therefore, a bank the first condition for the regulation of Turkish finances. The great mistake which has hitherto been made was not to separate sufficiently the bank as such from the transactions which it was t;o have with the Government for the regulation of the finances, and I have reason to believe that the Turks begin to perceive this. In all the bank projects which have been made hitherto the withdrawal of the paper money and of the debased currency was too much mixed up with the establishment of the bank itself; in one project the loan required for this purpose was even to have formed part of the capital of the bank, while in the others it was the onerous conditions which the Government wanted to force upon the founders of the bank with regard to this loan which made it impossible for them to undertake the formation of the bank. This false policy, to which I attribute in a great measure the failure of aU projects devised hitherto, may be explained by an equal want of confidence on the part of the Government towards those who approach it with financial schemes. Most of its dealings have been with natives, and their general experience has taught them the necessity of taking every precaution in order not to be outdone. They tried therefore in giving the concession of the bank to obtain from the founders, as it were, a share of their future profits by asking from them the loan for the withdrawal of their paper money at a more favonrable rate. For instance, while the shares of their loan were at 95-96 in the market they expected to get their loan through the bank at par, and only at the last moment they consented, not to an abatement in this respect, but to a kind of comprom ie, by promising 2 per cent, com^mission to the bank for the operation. It is a great step in advance, this insight into the mistake committed, and some results may be expected from it. The two things must be kept entirely distinct. Nay, it seems that theTurkish Government, in its own well-understood Interests, ought not to urge the matter of the loan at this moment, but be satisfied with enunciating the principle that the bank is obliged to give every help for the withdrawal of the paper money and the debased currency. It ought to promise not to issue any more paper money. The maximum sum required for the purpose should be fixed as well as the Interest, but all details about the actual Issue of the loan should be reseived for a fature understanding. The Turkish loan, according to the last accounts from Europe, is 83. The rate of exchange has been varying here from 143 to 146 for the last week, or about 20 per cent, discount. Now at what rate cam the Turkish Government hope to get a loan under these circumstances ? The concession for a bank to Messrs. Wilkin was sufficient to bring up the exchange to 117-118, and if they had succeeded no one doubted that the exchange would have been at par almost even befo: e the bank would have begun its operations. The conditions which the Government might have obtained then would have been quite diferent from thoze which it could obtain at this moment. Of course, if by a sudden stroke of magic the Goverament could withdraw the paper when It is at 20 per cent. discount, it would be a fine operation for t,; but, as this is impossible, it seems to me more profitable to wait with the loan and take advantage of the effect which the establishment of the bank with the obligation to concur in the regalations of the currency must necessarily produce. This regulation is as much in the interest of the bank as of the Government; indeed, it is a necessity for it, and it would be acting foolishly not to give its whole concurrence to the measures required to free commerce from this incubue. In the meantime the Turkish Government is paying dearly for its suspicion. By the variations of the exchange it has lost millions. As it pays in piasters, it bears the whole weight of the difference in al its transactions with Europe. All the stores for the army, for the arsenal, for the ordnance, are paid for by bils on Europe which must bebought at20andmorepercent. discount. The same is the case with the payment of the interest for the two loans in Europe. It maybe hoped that experience has made the Turks wiser, and that they will no more demand impossibilities and continue to pay twice and three times over for any difference which might have existed between them and the different bank projectonr, as they have done for the last year. Some of the French papers have spoken about a circular note addressed by the late Turkish Ministry to its agents about the union of the Principalities. A s the inistry has ceased to exist, the document is of only historical value. I send it you, neverthe- less, because it may afford the proof that it was notRedschid alone who is against the union, but that it is a decision which all Turks share to whatever party they belong. The Mlinistry which circulated it is supposed to have been thoroughly French, so the thing speaks for itself :_ " September 23. "I send you enclosed a copy of a despatch which we have addressed to the Kalmakan of Moldavia Immediately after the annulling of the elections. " The contents of this document wiU show to you wv'h what loyalty the Sublime Porte wil fulfil its engagements. " By the Alinisterlal despatch of the 14th of October, 1856, as well as hy its precedent and subsequent declarations, the Imperial Government has acquainted with the same loyalty its august allies who signed the Treaty of Paris its manner of viewing the question of the Danubian Principalities. " The Powers who have proclaimed to the whole world, by the solemn Congress of Paris, the great interest which they attach to the maintenance of the integrity and independence of this empire will, we are convinced, be obliged to theSubllme Porte for showing them that side of this question which touches this great interest, which has become a Enropean one. " God forbid that the Government of His Majesty the Sultan should doubt the purity of the intentions of any of these Powers, or that It should think that in maintanling one or another opinion they should have any wish but that of strengthening the principle above enounced. If we return so often to this subject it Is merely because we wish, as the most directly interested party, to enlighten tuhe opinion of our allies, and not to let them ignore the decided opinion of the Sublime Pore on a point which might en danger its legitbmate rights, held sacred for centuries, and, finally, to destroy the bad impresionL which might be pro. duced by hundreds of publications of the opposite party on the Government and the population. " A nevr and frank explanation on the part of the Sub. lime Porte seems to us so much the more seasonable as the annullation of the elections in Moldavia and the activity of therevolutionary clubs in Wallaehia have produced already a sensible discouragement among the inhabitants of hMoldo. Wallachia, who lately dared to show some independenoe in their opinion. " Assemblies elected under such auspices ought not and cannot inspire great confidenceo to the Sublime Porte as regards their respect for it. rights; oonsequently the Imperial Government, keeping within the limit. of the Treaty of the 30th of March, thinks it its duty to renew its deolara tion of the 14th of October last year, and to express franlly that, whatever may be the wlshes expresed by the Divans with respect to the 'Union of the two Prncipalities, the Sublime Porte, insisting on the text of the same treaty of Paris, according to which the final organization of the Prin. cipalities is reserved entirely to an understanding betwean the Porte and the other Powers,will find itself in the necossity of maintaining its resolution in this respect. "We firmly hope that this resolution, based as it is on vital reasons for Turkey, will be appreciated by the Governments to which we advise ourselves with the greatest coREdonece. Their justice and equity wil help us in thlr im. portant circumstance, we are sure. " I hasten to add that by this restrictlon,!n do not mean to exclude every idea of similarity in oertaii laws and iritutions which might be conciliated with the rights of our Sovereign and the maintenance cf the political separation,of tho two Provinces. "The understanding whoch has been happily restored about this queston between Par the Powers wuho tened the Treatyof Parisisa guarantee moreafor their sthactory conclusion, and we hope that this understanding will asrt. '"You are authorized to read this despatch to the.iniste of Foreign Snairs, and to leave him a copy." ITALY. (arOn oU OWN CO leftiOiDbNy.) TURIN, Nov. 3. The opening t f the railw,ay from Alexandria towards the frontder of Parva, which is intended to COnDeCt the Piedmontese railways withrthe Great Central Italian, and so become the main line frem the west of Europe to the Levant and Egypt, vie Ancona, is the evenrt of most inportance that has occurred hereabouts for Osme time past. On Sunday last the persons invited to be present at the ceremony of inauguration left Turin by the 6 o'clock train, and arrived about 10 at Alexandria, where they found breakfast provided for theni by their hosts, the shareholders of the Stradella Railway, and, after devotingan hour or so to the disecusion of this repast, and examiling the late improvements madexinthe Alexandria station, theparty, which included Count CaVOQr, Minister for Foreign aceitrs, Commendmrato fttazzi, Miniter of the Interlor, and Cavaliere Paleocapa, Minister of Public Works, left in a special train, drawn by an engine named Count Cavour, for Voghera. At the river Scrivia the train stepped to allow the passengers to alight and examine the railway bridge there wrhich consiStS of 13 arches, of 15 metret each, and excited the admiration of every one for its proportions and evident solidity. The architectural works on the line were generally admired, particularly the stations at Tortona and Voghera. The weather being beautiful, there were crowds collected on either side of the road to witness this opening of an undertaliing that promises to bring commerce and wealth to their district, and when the train arrived at Voghera, at half-past 12, there was a vast concourse of people already assembled to assist i the religious ceremony, which took place immsediately afterwvards. Facing the station was erected a graceful pavilion, contaiing an altar in the centre, and between the pavilion and the station were ranged sir locomotives, decorated with national flags and bouquets of flowers. Monsignor Negri, Bishop of Tortona, then proceeded to invoke the blessing, of God on this work of human hands, and in his sub?equent discourse, which was chiefly remarkable for its moderation, he demonstrated that railways and steamboats are principally to be regarded as a blessing to mankind, inasmuch as they favour the diffusion of Christianity and facilitate missions. After the benediction had been given by the Bishop I the crowd dispersed, and those who had gone from other places applied themselves to sight-seeing until dinner time. The dinner was laid in the Club-house for 120 guests, and to it were invited many distinguished men of this country, besides the Ministers above-mentioned and the local authorities. After dinner a map of the railway, showing how It would form the connecting link between the railway systems of the west and the south-east and east of ltaly, was distributed to every one present. Cavaliere Beltrami, Syndic of Voghera, then rose, and, having alluded to the annexation of his province to the Crown of Piedmont, described the advantages it might anticipate from the present railway, all which advantages he ascribed to the liberal system introduced under the form of government bequeathed to the nation by King Charles Albert, to whom the country should, therefore, be ever grateful, and he concluded by proposing the health of "Victor Emmanuel, the loyal King," which, as usual, was received with loud applause. The health of the Minister of Public Works was next proposed by the Advocate Depretis, a director of the company, who, in the course of a short speech, which met with vociferous and prolonged approbation, acknowledged the great obligation which the society owed to the Minister for his cordial, resolute, and indefatigable support oftheundertaking; and after the cheering had at length subsided the Minister rose to reply, and after having dwelt shortly on the technical merits of the railway they had just seen inaugurated, he denied his right to the praises bestowed on him by the Advocate Depretis, saying that he had done no more than his duty, and adding, " It has truly been a great pleasure for me to be p resent at the opening of this railway, although I could not see it." It was indeed a moving scone to see the venerable gentleman addressing the audience with energy and. eloquence on a work which he had hiself mainly assisted in perfecting, but which he was deprived of the gratification of seeing now that it was finished,-an audience that was divided between pity for his affliction and admiration of his talents, for It rmy be said that the sole drawback to the day's enjoyment was the too evident proof afforded of the total blindness which has overtaken the man who has been the prime mover in aU the great public works in this country during the last eight years. At halfpast 4 the party started to return towards Turin, but in consequence of the delays caused by the late floods the train did not arive hereuntil past 10o'clock at night. The railway so opened consists of two branches, from Novi and from Alexandria to Tortona, and thence to Voghera, making altogether 62 kilometers. From Voghera to Stradella, the frontier town towards the Duchy of Parma, is about the same distance as from either Novi or Alexandria to Voghera, and the extension to that point includes some considerable engueering works, so that it will not be open to the public for at least another 12 months, by which time it is to be hoped the Government of Parma WI nave mate sensible progress in carrying on the railway from the frontier to Piacenza and Parma. It Is reported from Milan that the Government at Vienna had auithorized the execution of the railway from Milan to the Pledmontese frontier at the bridge of Buffalora, and that the railway company proposes commencing operations without delay. From all parts of Italy we daily receive intelligence of damage done by inundation. In Piedmont a subscription for the suferers in this kingdom has been set on foot, and a provisional committee named for collecting it in the different provinces. I uuderstand that the Sardinian Government has received intelligence that, in consequence of its reiterated remonstrances the captainof the Cagliari has at length been allowed to have some of his own clothes from his ship-that is to say, that the King of Naples has been graciously pleased to allow the unfortunate man to change his shirt at the end of four months' imprisonment I NAPLES. (FROM OUR OWN COP}ESP0ONDENT.) NAPLES, Ocr. 3L Within the last week some incidents have taken place better worth recording than much that has occurred here of late. On Wednesday, the 28th inst., eleven of the crew of the Cagliari wvere liberated, andleft for Genoa. The procas verbal states that the Grand Criminal Court of Salerno, in conformity with Article 114 of the law of Criminal Procedure, gives them their libert7, re taining, however, all the documents on the subject in its archives. Eighteen others, forming the remainder of the crew, are retained under arrest, It is remaxk- I Cou.in of the present King of Prussia, f ble that tne names of the English engineers are not mentioned in this dodurment, and what inferEnce is to be drawn from this fact. I am at a loss to say. The procs verbal was signed on the 19th Inst., bti, by a pleasant assumption, peculiar to Naples, that imprisonment is an agreeable ietirement, the men were detained until the 28th irst. They left without having their effects given ,up to them, and,indeed, it was only last Tuesdaythateven the captain of the Cagliari, by a great stretch of political generosity, received his clothes. The act of ionAgnoment might have been drawn up for the delivery of a town. It required that Francisco Pignatlh, the judge Instructor, assisted by his chancm.or, and with the intervention of the Attorney-General of the Gratid Criminal Court of Salerno, present also seven other persons, should confer On this subject, and anall they did coneent to deliver up aim shirts, two pairs of pantaloons, two flannel waistcoats (one of which cannot be found) sim phi of woollen stockings, &c. The other articles are sdiniar in character, and thus it appears on what a sldeder thread hangs the monarchy of the Two Shilies Six shirts endangered its existence. As regatds *the English engineers, I am right, I believe, in stating that orders have been received from the Foreign-office to ascertain whether the law actually forbade the British authorities to communicate with the prisoners, and, in case it did not, to demand an instant interview on the part of the consuL This despatch was communicated to the Neapolitan Government, and an answer was returned to the effect that the law allowed of no such interview. Our fellowsubjects, therefore, remain as hermetically sealed as ever, which is doubly distressing after the reports which have been circulated with regard to the state of one of them, reports of the trath of which I have not the slightest doubt. The trial of the two men suwected of having murdered our poor countryman Blandford lat year, after having maade a certain progress, has again been deferred until November 4, in consequence of the meedical men not being abls to attend at an earlier day. It came on on Friday the 23d inst., was continued on the Saturday, and postponed until last Wednesday, the 28th inst., when it was again put off. The third man accused as an accomplice is not forthcoming. The depositions of the prisoners were read to them on the first day, when the younger of the two, starting up, declared that his deposition was false, as it had been extorted from him by the bastinado. Be admitted that he had stolen a watch, but that he had nothing to do with the murder, and declared that he had been beaten into an act of xelfausation. They called as witnesses in their favour three fellow-prisoners, who had been condemned to various terms of punisbment for murder, and two of these men perjured themselves. Mr. Roskilly, an English medical gentleman, who attended Mir. Blandford in his last moments, deposed that death had been caused by some person jumping on the body of the deceased; he also stated that Mr. Blandford had declared that he had given one of the men who attacked him a blow on the Hp, and the mouth of one of the prisoners at the time of his arrest was much swolen. Altogether, however, I am disposed to think that the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive to lead to a condemnation. The trial has been conducted with much Impartiality. Mr. Barbar, the British actino consul, was present each day. The mercantile correspondence from Palermo was seized last Sunday, but the letters were distributed the next morning, double postage being charged. Some delay has occurred in laying down the Submarine Telegraph from Malta to Sicily. The concession was granted to M. de Normau last July, aud at the time I stated that communication would be opened between Malta and England by the end of September. I see no reason why this desirable result should not have been obtained, as the cable has been ready for some time for shipment. The Neapolitan Government, therefore, communicated wlth its Consul-General in London, I believeby teleg,raph, a few days since, to ascertaln the cause of the delay; and a speedy answer was returned that the permission of the British Government had not been obtained for landing the cable in Malta. Why, at this important crisi3 in our Indian affairs, the utmost anxlety to shorten the distance between the two countries should not have been shown it is difficult to imagine; and I caU your attention to the fact in the hope that some inquiries will be made. The Centaur came in last Monday from Syracuse. The Prince and Princess de Joinville are still here, and last week visited His Majesty at Gaeta.
ORBTUB IN ENGLAND. (From the Examiner.) "rm never merry," says Duke Orsino, "when I hear sweet music." Ought it not to be-" I'm never merry when I hear street music?' The Belgravians, however, who have got up a petition 8g8inst the organ-grinding nuisance are not protest'ing either against music or musical instruments of any kind, but against the torments of the ear and tbe racks and other engines that unintermittingly inflict it. "low sour sweet music is when time is broke, and no proportion kept !" bLt the breaking of time and violation of musical proportiocs are the least part of the intolerable abuse In question, where the vilest instruments, thevilest airs, thevilest playing, and the vilest repetition and pertinacity are all in a conspiracy to torture one of the most delicate of our organs, and make all who have ears lament that they were given to hear witb. We have sanitary officers constantly hunting aftet b d smells, but it seems to be nobody's duty to hunt after sounes equally atrocious and not less injurious to health, if eltht r unmolested slumbers or nuruffled tempers are conducive to a state of salubrity.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANOERY. LtSCOLN'S.INN. Nov. 7. vt"M- - (Before the LORD CONOEI.LOR.) The arguments in this part;heard appeal from a decree of 7ice-Chancellor Kiudersley were this morniug resumed. £Sh question between the parties is whether thei plaintiff is entitled to have certain accounts of a partnersh)p between bim and the defendant taken in this court. The great diflic'ty apers to be to mako out what are the exact terms upoh whc the partnership was started. The LORD CHnCCELLOR reserved judgment. (Before ale LOsDS JUsTICEs OF APPEAL.) KING V. KIN<G. This was an appeal from a decision of Vice-Chencelor Stuart in this case, raising an important quebtion to trustees. Captain King had a power of appointment among the children of his then present marriage, and in default the fund, consisting of moncy due on mortgage, was divisihle among the children of that marriage and their issue. The wife being dead, Captain King exercised the power in favour of the only child of the marriage, Mr. Richard TwyfordKing. This gentleman attained 21 in May, 1836, and soon afterwards the father and son applied to the trustees of the fund to pay it over to them. The trustees not being satisfied that the interests of the son would be protected, as he had so recently attained his majority, refused to transfer, whereupon father and son filed a bill to compel them, pray. ing that the trustees might pay the costs. The Vice. Chancellor in June last, the son being 22 years of age, and stIll persisting in his desire for the transfer, made a decree according to the prayer of the bill, but directed the father and Eon to pay the costs of the suit. Upon the latter point (though in form an appeal from the whole decree) the plaintiffs appealed. Mr. AnNS and Ur. B. L Cx1rAMAN, for the appellants, contended that the conduct of the trustees had been so grievously oppressive and vexatious that the order of the Court below ought to have visited them with the costs of the suit personally, without permitting them, as usual, to take them out of the fuund, and tbat the making the plaintiff pay the costs was wholly out of the question. Several cases were cited, and among them that of " Re Woodburn's Trusts" (reported 26 Law Journal Reports (Chancery), 522), when the full Court of appeal deoide that trustees who had acted with vexation in paying money into court were made personally to pay costs. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUcE.-I have seen so much disapprobation expressed against the decision in that case that I am more than ever satisfied that it is right. Mr. BACON and Mr. WICKENS, for the trustees, said the thustees in the court below said they were wiling to do whatever the Vice-Chancellorthought right, and his Honour was so struck with the circumstances of the case that he caUed upon the counselfor the plaintiffs to explain what was intended to be done with the money, and when everyexplanationwas given which the parties thought fit to give the ViceChancellor on their own showing made the order complained of. They isisted on the old rule of the Conrt, that there should be no appeal simply for costs. His Honour in his Judgment gave the following most convincing reasons:" The plaimtiffs insist that the conduct of the defendants with reference to a fund which unquestionably belongs to the plaintiffs has been vexatious, -so vexatious, In fact, as to render them liable to the costs of this suit. The Court is always jealous of transactions between father and son which take place just after the latter attains his majority, and the effect of which is to throw his property under the control of his fathor. That jealousy has formed the ground of decision in so many well-established cases that one almost wonders at the arguments which have just been gravely advanced by counsel at the bar. The so-styled vexatious conduct of the defendauts was simply the conduct of persons actuated by precisely the same feeling of jealousy with which this Court regards trAnsactions of the nature now in question; and If ever there was a case In whlich that jealousy ought to bo exercised, it is the present. The duty of the defendants was to protect the interest of their cestuiqse trust, and especially that of the son, who but for their protection was, itseems,to look tohis fatberfornothing battcontrol." The learned counsel read letters to show that the son as under the influence of bis father, and that the father had expressed his opinion that n son ought not to be independent of a parent, so that it was plain that the trustees would not be safe in such a state of circumstances in acting with. out the sanction of the Court, for they would be doing no less than sanctioning a bresch of trust. Added to this, four months before the son came of age Captain King wrote to the trustees, saying it was arranged between himself and his son that 12,0001. out of the trust fud of 14,0001. should come into his, the captain's, own hands. Mr. YLUm-s said he considered it unnecessary to reply. Their LoRDsinrs, after conferring, desired the papers to be handed up, and reserved their judgment.
ROILS' COURT, CHANCERY.LAE. NOV. 7. SWUIZ'EN V. SWfNSEN. (Bcfore the MASTIR of the ROLLS.) Although the facts of this case have on two or three occasions been reported, it is necessary to some extent to rerapitulate them. Oa the 12th of July, 1855, the plaintiff, Csptain Swinfen, of the 5th Regiment of Dragoon Guards, filed a biU In equity against the widow of his cousin, Mr. Samuel Swinfen, of Swinfen-hall, Stafford, to set aside the willof that gentleman, on the ground that it was executed ata time when the testator was not in a state of mind sufficiently sound to make a will. On the 30th of July the Master of the Rolls sent the casO to the law courts on an issue devi. sanvit vel non. On the 15th of March, 1S56 the case came on for trial at Stafford, and on the 17th of the same month a compromise vras signed on behalf of the plaintiff and defendant by Sir Alexander Cockburn and Sir Frederick Thesiger, the leading counsel for the principals to the suit. On the 24th of March the solitors of the plaintiff wrote to the solicitor of the defendant for the necessary documents to carry out this compromise, and after some correspondence were informed that Mrs. Swinfen, the defendant, had never consented to the compromise agreed to on her behalf by Sir Frederick Thesi.ger, and repudiated it altogether. On the 15th of Way the plaintiff made the compromise, as signed by a counsel, a rule of the Court of Common Pleas, agreeably to a condition thereto expressed in the compromise itself, In MichaelmasTermn,185, the plaintiff obtained a rulenisiforsa attachmentagainstthedefendaattoshovwause why she should not be committed for contempt and disobedience of the rule of Court entered up against her. In showing cause against this rule for an attachment the defendant stated on afidavit "'that she had never ratified or adopted, or in any manner assented to, the arrangement entered into ou her behalf by her counsel; that immediately upon being iaformed of It she expressed to her attorney her astonishment aud resentment at what had been done, and her determination not to subxnit to the compromise; that her attorney had stated to her that he had nothing to do with it; and that she intended to repudiate it and contest its validity in every way." On the ist day of Eilary Term, 1857, the Court delivered judgment, -two out of the three judges present expressing their opinion that the compromise was a binding agreement, and that the rule foi an attachment should be made absolute; and the third judge holding " that the Court ought not to grant an attachmcent for contempt" against a party refusing to carry out a compromise made under such circumstances as those stated above. The Coart mot being unanimous, and it being a&alnst the practice of the Court to grant an attachment iF any member of the Court conceived the attachment ought not to issue, the rule sisi was discharged. In this state of things the plaintiff again reverts to the Court of Chancery for relief, and prays, among other things, that a receiver of the rents of the estates may be appointed pending the disputes between the parties; that the defendant may be restrained by information from receiving the rents or carrying on any actions of ejectment against the tenants; that the defendant may be decreed to execute the conveyance of the estates to the plaintiff, agreeably to the compromise of Ma&rch, 1Ss6; or that in case the ourt of Chancery is of opinion that the defendant ought not to execute such conveyance, then that a new issue dcrgsavU el won, or a new trial of the former issue, may be The ATToR;gY-GE\ERAL had but partiaOy reopened the case when the Court rose.
VICE-CEIANCELLORS, r.,nrTTzTq ?,-- ? WELLESLEY V. MIORNIGTON.-DIORNINGTON V. WET,. T.---.P (Before Vice-Civnedlor Sir R- T W--- - I It will be remembered that shortly before the rising of the Court for the long vacation these causes came to a hearing. The suits have for their object the carrying into efect the trust of a certain deed dated in 1831, and the rights of the Earl and Countess of Morningtox and of Viscount WeUesley in the property affected by that deed were involved. These estates are of very great value, and a sum of 462,0001. was directed to be raisedtopayoffencumbrances, &e., and several questions arose as to the construction of the trust instrument. One vas whether that sum bore interest. His Honour was of opinion that it did not. Another question was whethar the rents should pay the interest of encumbrances from the date of the deed; upon this point there was some controversy as to what was decided. The Court also decided that the Countess of Mornington, although she had abandoned pro. secuting her own suit, was not now thereby precluded, and certain accounts were directed. After this decision was 3nade, but before the minutes could be settled, the sudden death of the Earl of htornington took place. During the vacation attempts had been made to arrange the decree, but without effect, and the minutes were now discussed in court. MIr. Bally and Mr. Nalder apeared for the present Earl of Mornington, Mr. Rolt and Mr. Freeling for the Countess of Mornington, Mr. Cairns and Mr. Druce for the late earl, and now instruoted for his representative. The VrcI-CICANCELLOR said, with regard to the question of the rents bearing interest, what he decided was that they should exonerate the 462,0001. from the date of the .eed up to the death of the earL What he intended to do on the former occasion was to express an opinion on the various questions, but not then to make a decree, whioh could not be considered ag made until the minntes were settled. If that were so, which, strictly speeakng, was the fact, the late earl must be represented, and was entitled to be beard if he thought fit. The remainder of the minutes were then gone through in aetail, and the suit wil be revived against the representa. tive of the late earL GRANT V. GRANT, The qquestion in this suit arose upon a bond given by Alexander Thompson, whereby he secured two annuities of 201. eash to Adelaide Dapuis and Adelaide Alexandrine Dupuis, her daughter, in four events, that which had hap. pened being the daughter surviving the mother, in which case she was to have the whole annuity of 401. Adelaida Alexandrine Dupuis sold her annuity of 201. to Alexander Thompson, and married, and a suit being instituted to ad2ninister his estate and carry out the trusts of his will she and her husband carried in a state of facts whereby they claimed 201. in the event of her surviving her mother, and the Master in 1825 found them entitled to that sum. The annuity of 201. was paid up to the year 1845, and a dcoree bad been made directing an account of what was due upon the annuities upon the footlng of the report of 1825. The bond was dated in 1791, Adelaide Dupuis and Adelaide Alcxgn4rinue her daughter, were dead, and her reprss Ia- tive now claimed the whole annuity of 401., upon the construction of the wording of the bond, aRd as a new annuity psayble to her in the events which had happened. Mr. Swanston and Mr. Prendergast appeared for the represfetative of Adelaide Alexandrine, the daughter; Mr. Bally and Mr. Osborne for the defendants, without hearlag whom, The VICE.CHANCELLOR expressed his opinion to be that the intention of the testator was that the daughter should take an annuity of 201. for her life; that during their joint lives, and as long as the danghter remained single, the mother was to receive the whole 401., but that if the daughter married in her mother's lifetime she should then receive 201. a-year, and if she survived hermother the whole 401. This being so, the 401. was no now annuity, but formed of 201. already granted to the daughter and 201. coming from the mother; and the daughter having sold her 201. it could not now be claimed by her representative, as she had disentitled herself to receive it. No interest could be given. (Before Via-67tancelor Sir J. STUAaRT.) ALDERSON V. WHITE4 The question which was raised in this case was whether a conveyance wbich was made of certain lands In the year 1825 was a mortgage, or whether it was a sale with a right of repurchase by the vendor on re-payment of the purchasemoney and interest and any sums laid out on the lands, the purchaser in the meantime retaining for his own benefit the rents and profits of the lands conveyed. By deeds of lease and release, dated in July, 1825, David Newman, being entitled for his life to certain lands, conveyed his interest therein for hIfe to John Crump, his heirs andl assigns, in consideration of the sum of 4,7391.; and, by a third deed of even date with the release Crump agreed that in case Newman should at any time give one year's notice of his desire to repurchase his life interest in the above lands at the sum of 4,7391. Crump would at the expiration of such notice, and on receiving the sum of 4,7391., together with such sums as should have been paid for repairs and improvements, reconvey the above lands to Newmnan. The deeds of July made no mention of the payment of interest by Newman. Immediately after the esecution of the before-mentioned deeds CGump entered into possession of the lands therein comprised, and he and those claiming under him had continued up to this time in the possession of the rents and profits of those lands. Crump by his will dated in 1842 disposed ofthe abovelands, and in doing sohe mentioned them as being "subject to redemption on payment by him of the sum of 4,7391. and interest, together with the sums he might lay out thereon," and he uave the same to one White " to hold the same to him, his heirs and assigns, upon the same terms, trusts, and purposes as he tuen hed the same until the same should be redeemed or re-purchased ;" and he directed that when his trustee (White) "shouldbepaid the said sum of 4,7391. and interest, and such sum as would be due to him on the estate," his trustee should hold the same upon the trusts therein mentioned. Crump also, in a codicil to his will, after varying the disposition contained in his will as to a part of the sum of 4,7391. directed that " as soon as his said trustee shall be paid theprincipal sum of 4,7391., due to him from the beforementioned estate with interest," and all other moneys due to him therefrom, his trustee should stand possessed of such part thereof in trust as therein mentioned. Crump was now deceased, andiXewman had taken the benefit of the Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors. Mr. MAL.Ns and Mr. ROGns were heard for the plaintiff, the assignee in the insolvency of Newman, but the Vice Cbancellor declined to hear except as amici curi - Mr. Craig and Mr. R. W. B. Foster, who appeared forNewman, the insolvent, and was in the same interest as the plaintiff; Mr. Wigram and Mr. Faber were heard for the other defendants. The VICE-CHANCELLOR, without calling for a reply from Mr. Maiins, said the will and codicU of Crump Interpreted the nature of the transaction of July, 1825, and showed that he was to reconvey Newman's life interest on receiving back the sum of 4,7391. and interest and any sums he might have laid out on the estate. There must be a decree t that effect, the rents and profits received by Cramp and those claiming under him being set off against the sum of 4,7391., and interest thereon at 5L per cent. per annum, from July, 1825. As Newman had been improperly made a party to the suit, his costs must be paid by the plaintiff, but except as to that there would be no costs on either side. (Before Vice-Ohanellor S&r W. P. WOOD.) IN THR MATTER OF TIHE JOINT-STOCK COMPANES ACTS, 1856, AND OF THE UNITED GENERAL BREAD AND FLOUR COIMPANY FOR PFLYMOUTH, STONEIIOUSE AND DEVONFORT. Mr. ROXBURGo appeared in support of this petition, which was presented by a creditor of the company for the purpose of obtatning a winding-up order under the provisions of the Joint-Stock Companies Acts, 1856-1857. It appeared that the company had passed resolutions for their voluntary winding u., and had appointed "liquid dators," and were desirous that the matter should be referred to the Exeter Distict Court of Bankruptcy, the majority of the shareholders and creditors being resident at Plymouth, at which place the commissioner for the Exeter district held periodioal sittings. They were also desirous that the proceedings which had taken place under the voluntary wluding up should be adopted by the Court under section 19 of tbe Act of 1857. The pEtitioners did not object to either of th eea propoeitions. Mr. C. Pontifex appeared for the company. The VICE-CHANCELLOB observed that the proceedings under the voluntary winding up were not sufficiently before the Court to enable him to adopt them. He should make the usual order, referring the mntter to Chambers, where those proceedings might be brought before him, and if it appearad advisable ho might then refer the matter to the District Cot rt of Bankruptcy, with a direction to tbat Court to adopt the whole or anly part of them. FORBES V. FORBES. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL and Mr. SCHOMBERG were heard for the defence in this case, which was part-heard from Friday; Mr. BOLT replied. The VIcE-CHANcELLoR reserved his judgment.
COURT OF OTVP'- TIRcrN W- - ~ PPTvTT.ria1 VR-nr A-- (Sittings in Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and Juzices COLERIlDGa, WIGnTMAN, and ERLE.1 At the rising of the Court yesterday a writ of hcbeabe corpus was granted to bring up the body of a witness who had been arrested by a sheriff's officer while undergoing exa. uination before an arbitrator, with a view to his being discharged from custody. Mr. HA1wI.nST said he appeared on the part of the sheriff, and complained that the application had been made to this Coutt, when it might have been made to a judge at chamb ers. Lord CAsxPBELL said the party was entitled to be discharged. Mr. HAWKIIIs contended tho witness was not protected, unless he was subp cnaed to give evidence. Lord CAMPBELL said that if he attended voluntarily he wias equally protected. Mr. Mlilward, who appeared in support of the application t,o discharge the prison.er, wvas not called upon. Lord CAMrPBELL.-Lot him be discharged. He is entitled dcju,-e to be discharged. T he prisoner wras discharged accordingly. THE QUEEN V. BOURNE. When this case was called on it appeared that only two of the judges had been provided with paper books. Mr. SCOTLAND, who appeared for the respondents, said there were two questions raised, first, whether the convic. tion was food, and, eecondly, whether there was any right of *ppea. Lord CAMPBELL said the conviction could not be supported. It was for exposing goods for sale, the fhct being that the defendant had merely delivered goods previously sold. His Lordship asked the learned counsel whether his client had delivered the paper books ? Mr. SCOTLAND said he had not, but he honed the case might be struck ont and re-entered. Lord CAMPBErLL said it was clearly a wrong conviction, and gave judgment that it should be quashed. Mr. V'Mahon, who appearedfor the appellant, was not called upon. Conviction quashed. THE QUEEN V. STEWART. This was one of several eases which had been stated for the opinion of the Court, raising the question whether certain of Her Majesty's military officers occupying Crown property at Portsmouth had such a benefical oocupation, as made them liable to be rated to the relief of the poor. In the first case the appellant, Alexander Stewart, was the storekeeper, and oocupied a house belonging to the Crown, situated on the Gun Wharf. His salary was 7001. a-year, and the house in wvhich he resided contained as many as 16 rooms, though, as he had no family, only eight of these rooms were used by the appellant. It was found in the case that he had conaiderably more aocommodation than was necessary for the discharge of the duties of his office. Mr. HiLL, Q.C., and Mr. Coox, for the resNondeuts, contended that, as it was found in the case that the appellant had more accommodation than was necessary, he was rateable not only for the excess, but for the whole building. -Mr. WZLSBY, MIr. POUnnN, and Mr. RUSSELL contended that if the appellant did not use the rooms he could not be said to occupy them; and as ,rimal facic the property mas exempt, being Crown property, the appellant had no beneficl occupation. At all evenbs, he was rateable only for the excess. Lord C,ArnxPvL said he could not accede to the argument used by Mr. HiU, that the excess of accommodation took away from the appellant his Smmunity in respect of what was necessary, This officer was not rateable for that which was reasonably necessary for the discharge of the duties of his office. Bat it was found that he had considerably more than was necessary for his personal use, and for that excess he was rateable. The case must go back to sewAsons, in order that the rate might be amended, upon the principle that the appellant was to be rated in respect of all he occu. pied beyond what was reasonably necessary for the discharge of his duties. TIM QE1 V. STANESBY, This was the case of a porter, who occupied a house belonging to the Crown, It being found that the house wa3 more than was required for the personal use of the appellant and the performance of the duties of uhis office. Mr. WEISBY endeavoured to distinguish this case on the ground that It vas not stated that the accommodation was much in excess. Lord CiMPBELL said the appellant was rateable for the exces, and the rate must be amended aecordingly. THE QUEE V. BRETON. In this case the appellant was Major-General Breton, the Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth, and commander of the south-west district of England. A house was asigned to him at head-quarters, but though it was convenient to him to reside there, it was not incumbent upon him so to do. This and three other cases were ordered by the Court to be sent down to sessions, to be amended on the principle laid down. THE QUEN V. .WA. This case camne before the Court upon a demurrer to a replication in a, quo wvai.ianto which called upon the clerk of the County Court of Derbyshire, held at Chesterfield, to show by what authority he exercised the office of clerk of tat court. It appeared that originally tvwo clerks had been appointed to exercise their office jointly, but with distinct and sepazate duties. One of the clerks had died, and it was concluded that, as the original ppointoment was joint, the death of one operated to vacate tha office of the survivor. Anew and sole clerk was aacordingly appointed, and this proceeding was Instituted to decide the validity of the MrThe.th LL, Q.C. (wAith whom were Mr. Overend and Mr. Phipson), was heArd for the defendant; and Mr. Lusn. Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Brewer), for the relater. Lord CA BELL said, he was of o inon that judgment ought to he given for the defendant. whe intention of the Legislat3re was that the two clerks should hold their office during the good behaviour of each respetively, hut in case of the death or resignation of one that the other should not act till a companion should he appointed.

COURT OF COMMON PUPAS. Wvn,.Rm Vnv X PF. PATPT (&ltings in Banco, in Mkchaelrmas Term.) Mr. B&yALLsb moved on affidavits for a kaleas conrvu, di. reoted to the Sheriff of Jersey, to bring up the body of William Otto Patch, now oonfined in the gaol at Jersey for a debt of 191. 2g. It appeared fromn the affidavits that the prisoner is a British subject, who went to reside in Jersy i 183, ad hvin gtito debt was arrested onthe 29th of October, 1845, w,d,e-r an order called an ordre pro. visoire, issued from the Cour Royale, directing the amount of the iebt to be raised on the goods of the debtor, and in lefauli: the person of the debtor was to be taken into ens. .ody. The applicant was arrested, and had been kept in pion until now. During hie Imprlsonment he had lost his .heAlth and had become blind, and his vife had been obliged constantly to attend upon him. The order had therefore amounted to an imprisonment of beth for 12 years for a debt of 191. 2s. Other two affidavits of persons who stated themselves to be experts in the law of J'ersey stat-ed the arrest of the applicant to be contrary to the law of the island, which did not allow a debtor to be Imprisoned on a mere affidavit of debt without a juLdgment previously oh. tained against him.

It appeared that on the 12th of May last the defendant, who la the landlord of the Independent pubhichouse in Perry-street, Caledonia-road, was getting in some casks of porter which had just arrived at the entrance of his vaults, and that in endeavouring to draw up a barrel of stale beer to make room for the fresh one of the horses employed for that putrpose proved obstinate and required the applfcation of the whip. The plaintiff, who had been drinking in the house, came out at that moment and received from such whip a severe cut in the eye, -which laid him up for some time, and for the injury thus sustained he now sought to make the defendant liable, At the close of the case for the plaintiff, Mr. Serjcant PARr-Y called the attention of the learned judge to tho fact that the action was for an assault, and said that it ought to have beeni brought for negligent use of a whip.

The evidtence adducoed on either side was, as is usual in similar cases, extremely contradictory, and The learnedl JUDGE, In summing uap, gave It as his oiinthat on the record, as It stood (the defendant having pl'eaded simply "Not Guilty"), even though the plaintiff was standing where it was not prudent to stand, If he was hit by the defendant the latter was liable. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.-Damages, 1.01.; and, in answer to a question put by the learned judge, ini order to avoid if possible any further litigation, said that they could not agree inL deciding whether or not the plaintiff contributed by his own conduct to the acoident. An undefended ejectment case was then taken, and the first sittings In term for Middlesex terminated.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Ba.-inghaU-sirec Nov. 7. INE RE lMP AND lflT.AV- (Before Mr. Commi.ssioer FoIBANzouml uIne bankrupts were billbrokers in Nicholas-laue. His HONOUR gave judgment on the question of ceritfi. cate. He said, both bankrupts had failed before-Kemp In 1849 on his own petition, when he owed 14.0001., and there were liabilities to the further amount of 7001. He could find no trace of any dividend under thatbankrnptoy. A certificate of the second class was allowed by Mr.Commissioner Holroyd, after three months' suNpension. Clay was bankrupt in 1847, oVing, as he now stated, 20,0001., but more fortunate than Kemp, paying a dividend of 8s. 8d. in the pound. There being no classification of certificates at that time, he had no clue as to what was the Commissioner's opinion of his conduct. However that might be, both parties having been bankrupt before, it became exceedingly incumbent upon them that their trading 8hould be conducted with great caution, and the more so because they had very little capital to fal back upon in case of any misfortune. Although it was true that the ordinary trade of a billbroker did not requite much capital, yet, in every case wbere there was no capital, the caution should be in proportion to the reserve to faU back up;on. Hle found that the trading, commencing as it did with a capital of 1,6001., had been conducted very improvidently. A good deal of trust had been given to persons who turned out to be utterly unworthy of credit. If the bankrupts had exercised due caution they could not have been imposed upon as they had been. At the same time their books were well kept,and he was willing to give credit for that. The books, however, being balanced day by day, the difficulty arose why the baukrupts did not sooner discover their position. His impression was that they must have known long ago that they were in difficulties. It certainly appeared that in December, 1856, they felt their difficulties, and the result was an offer of composition, which was not carried out, because, as they now said, they expected to be able to pay the creditors in fulL It was now quite clear that they could not have done that. In the April following their position was so desperate that, having an action brought against them by a person whom they had indicted without sufficient cause, they were unable to pay counsel's fees, and in consequence of that and their then owing 4001. or 500Z. to their attorney he must conclude that they were in the most hopeless state of insolvenoy. Notwithstanding these circumstances, it appeared that both bankrupts, particularly Kemp, had been extravagaat as regarded personal expenditure. Clay, who stated that he was liviDg with his father-in-law, with no furniture, expended 6001. a year. Taking all these circumstances into account, and seeing no trace of any fraud, he was willing to give them credit for that-but consideringthe improvidence of the trading and the large expenditure he could only award the bankrupts third-class certificates, with a suspen. sion as to Kemp of six months, and as to Clay of t ree months from the Last examination. Protection would be grnted. IN RE GROUJX'S IT MPROVED SOAP COWiANY.-MMTED. An order absolute was made for winding-up this company, after a protracted discussion of not the slightet intexest.

Mr. B. J. Msellush, clerk to Messrs. Coutts, said,-The order produced for a checkbook was presented to me on the 5th inst. It purports to he signed by H. and S. R. Lewin, who keep an account at our hank. The prisoner presented it, and I gave him a checkbook mark-ed and numbered F.

Adamis.-I am one of the principals of the Issue Department of the Bank of England. My attention was yeaterday called to the 2001. note produced. It is endorsed, "Thox. Brown, 105, Oxford-street." I referred to the Directoryj, and not finding the name of Browvn to that address I asked the prisoner if he lived there. Hle said he did not, and that a man had given him the note In the street. Mr. H. Lewin.-I am a solicitor at 32, SouLthamnpton. street, strand. The order produced for a checkbook is not hinmy writing nor wasIt signedby my authority. Idid not sign the checkproduced for 2501., and which purports to have my signature attached to it. Edward Funnel], the detective officer, said -I saw the prioer at the Bank of England yesterday afteroon, and askedhim whom he received the 2001. note from. He replied thAt a, man bad given it to him In thea street, I asked him if he knew the man. He aid he did not, but that he met himnear Ludgate-hill I aked him howv much e had been promised forgetting the note cashed, and he replied If. He added that he was to meet the man in St. Paul's Churchyard. I asked him to give me his own name and address, and he 'wrote on a piece of paper, " William Wilcox, 76, Hattongarden," and said he was clerk to Mr. King, 19, Madioxstreet. At the statlon-house he took from his pocket a handful of sovereigns. I asked him where he gotthem from, and ne replLed "From theman who gaveme the note to get cashed." I ased him if he had been to Coutts's. He replied, ttI may as well tell you the truth," and afternards said that the man who had given him the note had given him a check for 250., which he took to Coutts's and got cashed in a 2001. note and 50.ingold.

The charge was preferred by Mr. Rawlings, a residlent In the street, who, hving served in the Indian army and suf. frred very mruch, consequently, from brain fever, found himself more than usually affected by the constant grinding of this oppressive music, which sometimes continued til after midnight without the siughtest interraption of the polce, and he (complainant) was rendered unfit to p lu his professonal avocatons that of conducting classes) by this terrtble nuisance, which, he regretted to say, was openly encouraged by somne loose women irn the neighbourhood, living In a street at the hack of his house, On the morning in qestion he requestd the defendant to desist fromplainmg, uthepaidnoattentiontoterequest, and when witness went out to look for a polieman, two of the women referred to beckoned him into their house, where he continued playing In the passage, When he came out agadn witness gave him into custody.

On coming down next mnorning he found his shop in confusion, the locks of the doors having boen forced, and property to the amount stated carried of.He Immediately acquainted the polioe with his loss, and the troperty was traced to the kitchen of the house, 10, Upper ~leveland-street, Fitzroy-square, where the two prisoners, after a desperate resistance, were captured by the police, but a third man escaped. Edward Smith, a cabmtan, residing at 10, Upper Cleveland-street, sd he was hired by a man whom he knew, named Onslow, to take up a job aund wait about half-past 10 o'clock on the night in question. About 2 o'clock in the mooming one of the prisoners and the mm not in custody got into his cab near the New Inn, Tottenhamn.court-road, and told him to drive to Charlotte-plaew. They got out, and they and the other prisoner soon after returnod with two great black bags or sacks and cmmed them into his cab. On asking where hewas to go to the third man said, "1Oh, anywhere; take them to your houw." Not lkida to do so, he hesitat, on which one of the pisoners repted, brIf you will not take them to your place we must have them, You shall have your fare." te ultimately took them home. The prsoners left, and came in the morning and were taken. He had told all he knew of theaffair. The prisonera, who re-served their defence, were committed for triaol. Willam Atkins, alis Hawkins, and Margaret Watt, alias Baines, of 46, Queen-street, N'ew.cut, Iarabeth, were brought before M~r. BInGHAx for re-examinmation, charged, the former with stealing a lageqantity of property froma various houses, the doogrs of which had been forced, and the female prisoner with receiving portions of the same, well knowing them to have been stolen. Among the rest, property had been stolen from 45, Ber. wick-street. belongig to Eiss Elizabeth Buck, of the value of 2001. This was on the General Fast-day, the 7th of October, and the mode of entering was by forcing open the street door with a "liemmy," or small crowba-. An instramient of this description was found on the prisoner on his apprehension, and the matks on the door perfectly corre. sponded with it. The property stolen consisted of pieces of s and satin, and slver plate. Part of the proerty was traced to the,prisoners, and identified by Miss Buck A witness alsosworetohavingseen themale prisoner onthe second-floor landing of the house in qtuestion on the day named. There was likewise a case against the prlsoners for stealig from 15, King-street, Golden-square, property conSating of wearing apparel to the amtount of 201. Vincent Grimnmer, a sergeant of the C division, and Charles Cole, a detective, traced out part of the stolenpropertyto the prisoner Watt's possesson, and this case, through their means, was also fully established against them. There were also other cases. Committed for triaL WoRsBr-sTmxnr.-Caleb Smith and Thomas Herbert, two men well known to the poUce, under various names, as " duffers," or dealers in spurious artildes, were charged with fraud. On the morning of the 30th ult. the prisoners called at the house of a beershopkeeper at Hackney named Bostock, and asked him if he was inclined to purchase some excellent tobacco, of which they had a large quantity to sell, and would be disposed to let it go at a very low figure. Bostook asked to look at some of it, and they produced a sample of what certainly was good tobacco, and asked him 2s. per pound for it. The price satisfied the witness that the article mnust have been stolen, if they really bad it for sale, and he boldly asked them whether they iad not obtained it " on the cross," or dishonestly, and one of them hinted that that mlghtbe the case, andconfidentilly told Bostock that hewas, in fact, then upona ticket-of-leave, Bostock said it was somewhat hazardous, but that he was inclined to buy if they would take Is. 6d. per pound for it, to which, after some demur, they assented, and as Bostock objected to do such business at his own house, they agreed to meet him in half-an-hour opposite Shoreditb Church, and In the meantime go to a publichouse for refreshment. The moment they had left Bostock set off for the house of a constable named Sturgeon, who happened to be out, and he therefore ran on to Ro'bertstreet police-station, where he met Sturgeon andTwist another officer, to both of whom he commaunicated the offer made him, and, it being arranged that he should carry out the bargain, the two officers placed themselves in the parlour of a house opposite the church to watch, and had not been there long when, to their surprise, they saw that the men they had come after were two very old acquaintances, who had been sharpers about town for a good number of years. Bostock, who took up his station jst by the churcb, was directly after met by the prisoners, who teok him down an archway, and there one of them drew from a black bag he was caring a very large parcel, one end of which displayed a rent in It, as if acdidently made, but from which protruded a bunch of tobacco of thesame .aUty as that which had been previously shown him. Bostook asked how much it weighed altogether, and they assured him that it weighed exactly 481b., and, after some fmther demur as to the quantity exceeding Bostock's expectations, the two men consented to accept 31. for the v'hole, which was much less even than the reduced price they had before agreed to. Just as Bostock, however, was feeling in his pocket, as the men believed, for the money, Sturgeon seized Herbert, who had carried the bag, and Twist seized Smith, and both then laughingly told the constables that they need not trouble themselves any further about the examination of the package, as it was nothing but a " dummy," containig only the small bit of tobacco that was vlsible at the end, and that the whole of the rest of the weight was made up of sawdust ; and this upon examination at the stationturned out to be the case, the pri- soners enjoying this confirmation of their fraud amazingly. Neither of the officers seemed to have a very friendly feeling towards the prisoners, for Smith, it appeared, had obtin sums of money from numerous detective constables about twvo year ago, by pretending that he knew the full particulars of what had become of some plate Her Majesty was robbed of at that time, and the only thing belonging to which that could be found was an emptyplate. chest, discovered rifled and broken open in Bishop tonner'sfields; and upon thel money so obtainei for the invented nformation gven to the officers he subsisted for some time, till they at lengh discovered that they had been imposed UpOn, took him into custody, and upon his trial and convicionhe was sentenced to a lengthened term of imprison- Each prlsoner now declared that they had received the parcel from a third person to sell upon commission as tobacco, and that they believed it to be so; but Mr. HAMMML did not believe so transparent a fabrication, and committed them both for trial at the next Middlesex sessions. CLEXRRMM=xL.-oseph Drake, a datryman at No. 124, Bayhain-street, Camden-town, surrendered to his recognizances before Mr. TyrwmraTr, charged with having commltted a rape upon the person of Alice Toombs, aged U years, the daughter of a police-constable of the B division. Some further evidenee was then given, which showed that the prisoner hadi been under medical treatment. The prisoner wFas committed to Newrgate for trial on the charge of rape. SOUTHWAR1U.-John Baker, a young fellow about 18 years of age, was brought before Mr. BURCHAm, charged with having committed the folowing fraud on Sergeant Anthony Coyne, of the 3d Surrey Militla, and Sergeant Quinlan, of the EBast India Compnys Artillery. Sergeant Coyne said that on the previous day the prisoner came to him at the rendezvous, and presented imself as a volunteer for the Militia. Witness asked him whether he had previously enlisted ln Her Mjesty's or the East India I:ompany's service, and on his replyng in the negative he enrolled him; but previous to brnging him to this oourt for attestation he uAvanoed him 6d. for refreshments which were supplied to him. The amount was to be deducted from the 1Os, bounty which he would have received after being sworn in. Wher. he brought him to this court for that purpose Sergeant QuinIan was present with recruits, and thea the prisoner bolted out and ran away. Witness, however, pursued him and brought him back, when Quinblan identified him as having previondy enlisted with him, therefore, as a protection to the recruiting stag and a caution to such persons as the prisoner, he gave him ito custoy. Witness Informed hs wor3hip thatlatterly ithad beco6meao ommon practioe for young men like the prisoner to enlist In the line or East India Company's servicoe, and after reoeiving the shilling to enrol themselves in the Militia, when they received 10s. bounty. As soon as that was spent they got attestedi and joined the former service, so that the Militia was swiudided out of the lOs. He therefore wished it to be publicly known that such oharacters could be severely pun 1 Had not Sergeant Quinlan been in court the prisoner would have been sworn in for the Militia, and received the balance of the lOs. and after that he would have joined the East India Company's servim The prisoner said he was put up to the trick by another recruit at the rendezvous, and he did not think it was an harm, as he was soon going to whop the Sepoys in India W, mneant to stick to the army. Sergeant Quinban said that the prlwoner came to him about three hours previously and enlisted In the East Inda Compsny's cavalry. Hle gave him the enlisting shilling, and told him to come to this court to-day to be swrorn in. WVitness considered him as a lawful recruit. The prisoner said he was quite willing to join Sergeant Qulinan at once. Mr. BUROn.ir told him that, as the two sergeants were in court, he should not punish him or send him for trial, hut deliver him up to Quinban. Ee was, however, liable to eseverey punished, and he hoped It would act sa caution to others not ho attempt a similar trick, SamBm-Mr. Coulcher,'a law stationer residing at 50, Chancery.lane, appeared before the Hon. G.,C NORTON to answer to a summons charglng him with unlawfully attempting to enter a carriage belonging to the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway ompany, while it was in motion. The case occupld a coniderable time in hearing but the brief facts seemed to be these - It appeared that on the 17th of October, one of the great fountain days at the Crysta Palace, the railway station was much crowded, and the defendant, having waited for a length of time-two hours it was stated by Mr. Morgan, his solicitor-he, with a child his arms, caught hold of one of the handles of a*irstclass carrage, and clung to It while the trainw as movingat a rapid pace. It waswomrn bv thrae witnesses thatitwas a perfectmercbinf and the cd hadnot been kIlled on the spot, and that he would have been had not Mr. Morri, a clerk at the Crystal Pace, who was on the latform, and who had witnessed his perilous situation, laced his arms round him and preventec the accident. The defendant, however, did not seem to appreciate the kindness at first, struck one of the company's offlcers two blows on the head, and had his coat torn. Mr. Morgan addressed the Bench at some length, denying the truth of much of the evidence given by the raiway officials, and said all his client did was to endeavour to get away by the train after being detained for two hours. The officers of the company oomplained of the want of gratitude for his preservation on the part of the defendan-. an opinion which the maglstate parti Io ted in, and recomi mended a Eattlement of the cue by the dfendant paying 11. to the poorbox.

MILITABY AND NAVAL INTBLLIGMYOR. On Saturday afternoon the troops belonging to the tbil battalion of the 60th Rifles, who are under orders to eenbrk for India, were inspected at Chatham by Colonel W. H. Eden, commandant of the garrison. They will leave Cbatham this morning and embark at Gravesend on board the Indomitable for Mhadras. Ensign W. L. E. Ogilvy and Eusign H. St. George B3rton, 60th Rifles, go out in chargI of the reinforcements. Information has been received at the head-quarters of the MIedical Staff Corps, Chatham, that the authorities at the War-office have it in contemplation to seed a large body of stewards, wardmasters, and orderliee to Alexandria, for the purpose of being employed in the transit of the troops wrho are proceeding overland to India, and also of rendering assistance to the sick and wounded soldiers who are returning to England. On Saturday 100 recraits airived at Chatham Barracks from the reoruiting districts of London, Bristol, Liverpool, and York, mal1ng a total of upwards of 400 who joined the 1st, 2d, and 3d battalions during the past week. A troop of the 15th Hussars have left Norwich en route for Coventry. Large numbers of recraits oontinue to arri ve at the Colchester Camp, and a portion of the second buttalion of the troops now in camp are about to be despatched to India. Mdajor-General Lawrence, who has commanded the Camp for some time, has received another appointment in the south-eastern district. The president of the general oourt-rnarUial which recently assembled at Chathamn Garrison for the trial of Eueign Thomas Stauley Mitchell, 89th Regiment, on a charge of intoxication when on duty, has received an intimation that in consequence of the prisoner having refused to appear before the court Her Majesty has directed his dismissal from the army. A general court-martinal wsembled at the Royal Marine head-quatters, Woolwich, on Thursday, for the trial of First Lieutenant Sharp, on an indictment preferred against him by his oommanding officer, charging him with conduct unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman. The members of the court were,-Colonel Stranslaam, president ; I.eutenant-Colonel Congdon, Brievet-Major Fraser, Brevet-Major Elliott, Captains Bunco, Harris, M'Carthy, and Wilson, First Lieutenant Pritchard, all of the Royal Masxine Light Infsut2v, and three Lieutenant-Colonels and one Major of the Royal Artillery. Lieutenant and Adjutant Fraser, R.5L, acted as Deputy-Jadge-Advocate. The court was occupied the whole of Thursday and Friday in receiving evidence for the prosecution, which was to the effect that the prisoner had absented himself from duty without leave, and had endeavoured to justify his conduct by a series of false statements to his command-ng-officer. On Saturday the prisoner read his defence, declaring his Innocence, and referring to his hitherto unblemished chara-ter. The judgment of the Coux zwill be forwarded to-day for the approval of the Lords Commissioners. A detachment, consisting of Lieutenant Rideout, 1 sergeant, cnd 42 gunners of the Royal Horse Artillery, Woolwlcb, have received orders to emberk on board the trauspoiz John Marshall, at Gravesend, for Calcutth, for the purpose of iillm,g up va a-noies in two troops there. tlajor-General Sir Frederick Love last week inspected the dep6t battalions stationed in Limerick, and ordered the 2d battalion of the Buffs, which bas bcen raised under .ientenunt-Colenel Maude, C.B., in an incredibly short space of time, to hold it-Aelf In readincss to proceed to England. The new battal!on promises to be a vexy fine regim.ent, and is already above the establiahment, 650. The head-quarters are still at Cozfu, and are suffering n aerely from fevers and ophthelmia. The sailimg transaprt Starr, of Halifax, sailed on Saturday from Woolwich Arsenal with a cargo of gun carriages and etores for Bermuda.

She may be expected shortly at Plymouth to be fitted with machinery and a screw propeller. The steam storeship UIrgent, from Portsmouth, arrived in ,-ymouth Sound on Saturday. THE MILITIA. The Worcestershire Regiment of Militia is ordered to muster at Worcester on Thursday next. It is expected that the regiment will be ordered to undertake garrison duty, In a few days a large number of draughts from several regiments, including the 21st, 71st, 46th, 48th, 14th, 2Sth, and 57th, in all about 600 men, will be assembled In Cork for embarcation on board Her Majesty's ship Urgent. Their destination i*s forservice in the Mediterrean. The 2d Lanark Militia will proceed from Dublin (on arrival) to Kilkenny. The SouthrDown, from Dublin to Aldershott. The South Devon, from Plymouth to Dublin, thence to laterford. The City of Dablin, from Dublin to aiverpool, for Newrsatle-on-Tyne. The Tower Hamlets, from Liverpool to Dublin, or ewly. The Limerick County, from Buttevant for Alderehott, rvd Liverpool. The Shroprblre, from Liverpool to Dublin. The Antrim Rifles, from the Curragh, t'4 Dablin, to Livernool, for Dover. A Cork paper of Frlday says,-" Yeste-day 21 privates of the South Cork Militia were conveyed here in cars from Ferraoy under a strong police emcort ard lodged in the County Gaol, for having enlisted into the North Cork MIilitia and obtained the bounty. The men, vho were brought before Mr. Neal Browne, R.M., adwitted that they bad been in the South Cork, but that the reason they enlisled in the other oorps was that theirs had not been called out for service, and that having heard the North Cork were destined for foreign service they were anxious to serve their Quc 3n and country rather than remain at home idle. They were committed to gaol for periods of six weeks or two mouths each. Certainly at a time when so much is said about the necessity for procuring recruits this seems rather a harsh way of dealing with these men."

The usucl programme wiU EY departed fzom in a most Important respect, as there will be no procession by i the water. Another departure from the old custom will also take place, for there WiU h3 no squadrons of dragoons aa an escort to his Lordship. There will be the juvenile band of the Royal Military School at Chelsea. the band of the Life Guards mountd, of the London Militia, and a large military band; but it would seem that the demands for India have so far denuded us of troops that we cannot afford a squadron or even a troop for the Lord Mayor. His Lord. ship might, it is trae, have a guard of honour of the Life Guards, or Horse Guards Blue, but such an honour is, of course, reserved for a higher power than the City King.

U2LTIVRRSfTY IMWELLamAl?Oz OXFORD. Nnv. R The University sermons were this day preached, in the morning by the Regins Professor of Divinity (Dr. Jacobson), at Christ Church, and in the afternoon by the Rev. Dr. Gonlbttrn, of Merton College, at St. Mary's. The Senior Proctor has issned the list of candidates in the Sbhoois of atathematical and Physical Science, Law and Modem History, and Natural Science. The number of name8 is, in the Mathematical School 78, in the Modern History School 91, and in the N.atural Science School 14. The JuniorProctor will receive thenames of cand;.datesfor the publie examinations under Moderators in thns present term, on Fridny, November 13, from 1 till 3 o'clock;* Satnrday, NTovember 14, from 1 till 3 o'clock;* and the names of candidates for the final examination under the old system on Saturday, N ovember 14, fromn 1 to 3 o'clock. The Regius Professor of Divinity proposes to begin a course of public lectures on Friday, the 20h of November, at 12 o'clock, at Christ Church. These lectures are intended for Students of Divinit'y who have passed their examination for the Degree of B.A. in the Liiermc Humaniores School. The Professor requests those who desire to attend to deliver in their names to him, with a written recommendation, either from the governor of their college or from their tutor, on Thursday, the 19th of November. On Flriday, the 6th inst., Mr. A. W. RE-nt; M.A. (Newdigate, 1851) was admitted Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. CAMBRIDGE, Nov. 7. An adjourned meeting of the Sellate took place in the Art School at 2 o'clock to-day. Tho proposed new statute respecting the the Plumian professorhli of Astronomy was first discussed. It proposes to add the Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and the Sadlerian Professor of Mathema, tics to the present board of eleotors, which consists of five, thus making it to consist of seven electora. Mir. C. C. BABINGTON, of St. John's, said, that with regard to the constitution of these electoral boards, aboat which there was so much difference of opinion, he would put in thie amendment:- "T That in the elections made by all electoral boards those elections should be ondrmed by grace of the Senate, thu3 remerving the rtghts of the Senate I This would cause the electors to be more careful In their selections. Mr. ROBY, of St. John's, thought the eleotozs should be few in number, and those a pointed for a considerable leugth of time, and he concluded his address to the meeting by handing in the following amendment to all statutes regulating the appointmaent of Professors:- "That three boards of electors bhoonttitluted, one for the ProfeasortElD of languages and the Moral 8cde ces; one for thoe of Mathematica and the Natural Eclences, and one f r thote of Divinity. "That each board consist of five persons elected spedaUy for tis purpe by the Senate; each memaber of each of the said boards being elected for a Dsriod of 20 years." The PiLrmiN PRoywSon made some observations, in which he stated that he felt it would be lnoxpedient to in. terfere with the foundation of his professorship, and with which the Vice-Chanu-l1or concurred. The NoRRisstAa 'EoFrnssos of DsvINITY objected to the views of Messrs. Babington and Roby. He was opposed to a Senate election of a board of electorB; it might bring out all the odium Theologicum under that bead as bad as if it were the election of the Professor himself. He feltj the electing board would be better when not elected for the special purpose. The objection to the Council was that it was too numurous, and he thought a better way would be to modify the old boards so as to adapt them to the present state of things. Professor JARRETT had great objection to ecx -officio elec! tor. He thought an acquaintance with the subject was indispensable, and that the elector should not trust to common report. He then proposed:- "That the Heads of Colleges should each nominate one person, from whom the Senate should elect ten, theEe to conastitut a board of electors." Mr. CAmrIoN, of Qaesn's, objected to a large board; as the numbers increased the responsibility was lessened. The Heads of CoUeges were not fit from their number, and were elected without any refercuce to such objects. Professor THOrN'soN suggested that on the vacancy of any Professorship the Council should appoint three competent persons-these to be proposed seriatim to the Senate fortheir confirmation. He thought no party spirit could interfere in such a case, but he would not extend it to the Professorships of Theology. Tho odium Helraicum or Arabicum he did not fear. The Vrcl-CHAs=Lon, in the course of some remarks, observed that the appointment of any board for a long period would be altogether destructive of science. The meeting next proceeded to the consideration of the proposed statute for the Lowndean Professorship of Astronomy. Professor BROWN said,the electors to this professorshipviz., the Lord Chancellor and those associated with him,were, in his opinion unfit, since they could not, from their position, avoid being inulenced by political feelings. Mr. DioN, of Ciare, addressed the meeting, alluding to the mode of election in the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. In considering the statute to govern the four Mathema. tical Professorships, under head of duties, Professor CEALLIS wished to impress on the University that the duty of Profesors of that class was not merely to teachone great object was to promote science. There should be a strict regulation as to residence, but the regulations as to lectures should no' be so strict as to prevent them from bringing forward new points. In this respect suffielent latitude should be given. He also thought that the Board of Mathervatical Sciences should consider their schemes so as to distribute the various branches of mathematics among the Professors generally. The VICE-PBOVOST of KxG'shanded in a general scheme for the election of Professorships, proposing six elected boards instead of three, as proposed by Mr. Roby. It being 4 o'clock the meeting adjourned to honday. [IZrratum.-In OUr report which appeared in T/he Timrues of F?riday there was an error respecting the Grace with regard to the Easter vacaiion. It did not propose to fix it from ALpril 7 to April 14, but to shorten it to a fortnight.]
THEn STEVEAAE Mu.DER-Since the discovery of the mutilated remains of a policeman in a pool of water near the vlllage of Stevenage, Hertfordsbire (as annouinced in a paragraph in Tle Times of Thursday last), circumstances have tran2pired which clearly point: to the perpetrator of the murder. The name of the unfortunate policeman was John Starkins; he was formerly in the employ of the Earl of Verulam, at St. Alban's, and onlyjoined the county constabulary force a few months ago. He had, however, displayed so much activity and intelligence that he was frequently employed upon occasions where in ordinaryeases thes6rvices of more experienced members of the force are engaged. Numerous pettydepredations have recently taken place in the neighbourhood of Stevenage, and in conEequence the police have received strict orders to seurch the baskets or wallets of the farm labourers returning from their work. On the afternoon of Friday, the 30th nlt., Starkins was directed by his inspector to look after the men returning from their work on the Hertford side of Stevenage, and he was particularly ordered to watch the proceedings of a man named Carpenter, who was suspected of stealing his employer's corn, and who had been frequently heard to s;y that no one policeman should ever search hiw. The constable was also directed to return to the policestation and report himself at 6 o'clock. At half-past 5 o'clock he was seen in a lane leading from the high road to Norton-green Farm, in the occupation of Mr. Horn, about 150 yards from the spot where his body was ubssquently discovered. Nothina more was seen or heard of him until tke following Monday, when in conseqoence of a strict search having been ordered to be made for him, a pollce-constable named Isgate entered a field called the " Baches," and in a pool of water at the lower cnd he observed the foot and hand of a man above the water. He immediately obtained ass'stance, and on recovering the body it proved to bo that of the unfortunate man of whom he was in search. It presented a shocking spectacle, the throat being cut and the head nearly severed from the body. There were also several wounds on the back of the head and shoulders, which appeared to have been inflicted by a knife or dagger. The ground near the pond bore traces of a desperate struggle. The grass for some dietance was trampled and torn up, and in the field lay a pair of handeufis, as though the struggle had occurred while the constable was attempting to -make a cap. ture. The man who has been apprehended and upon whom suspicion rests as the perpetrator of the murder is the labourer mentioned above-Jeremlah Carpenter, an athletic young man, who for some time had been emuloyed on the Norton-green farm, and who lvedin one of four cottages at the south end of Stevenaee, about 300 yards out of the town, and about a raile from the farm. The grounds of suspicion aainst him areas follow :-On Friday, tho day of the murder, he was not employed at the farm, but in a field at rsome distance from it. RIe left work about half. past 5 o'clock in tho evening, and his nearest way home was across the secluded field in which the murder took place. He did not, however, reach his cottage until 10 mmutes past 6 o'clock, having taken 40 minutes in going va distance which he usually walked in 20. A muan named Shepherd, who works on the same farm, and lives in the cottage adjoining to that occupied by Carpenter, was detained on the farm for a quarter of an hour after Carpenter left, but reached home first, and shortly afterwards saw Carpenter come from the direction of the railway over a fence into his own ga'den, whence he entered his cottage by the baok door. Shepherd noticed that the sxnockfrock which Carpnuter wore was twisted round his shoulders, and soon afterwards he reappeared from thae cottage ldressed in his Sanday clothes, and went into Shepherd's house, where he stated that he had been attempting to split the trank Qfatree xurRhadlhurt his leg. Shepherdexamined the leg, which was much swollen, an 'd ise.Carpnter to see a dec. tor. Ag soon as the above facts reachedjthe ears of thepolice Carpenter was talken into custody. At the time of hi. apprehension he wore the clothes which he liad on on the day of the murder, and on examination it wvas dkcoverei that his smockfroAc, boots, and pocket-knife, bore marks of bloed. le, however, stouLtly denies his guilt, and accounts for- his unnisaul delay in reaching home on the night of the murder by ntating that he took a circuitous route. At tho spot wh-re the struggle evidently took place in the "Baches" a quantity Of corn was found lying upon the ground. It haos been examined by Cir Horn, the prisoner's employer, who states that it is iy every respect similar to some which has been abstracted from his premises. A post mortem examination of the body has been made, and the mi thedaevidencegs to eshow tothat the unfortunate man wa. strangled, robabbly by the murderer graspinR him by his neckerchief, and that his throat was cut while he lay in a stateo of uLnconsciousness upon, the ground. Carpenterhas been examined before Mlr. Prime at Hitchin, and stands remanded, The adjourned inquest upon the body WMl take0 place at Stevenage this day (Monday).

H4YMAATKE ?THEATRE. Mr. Tom Taylor has attained so high a degree of dramatio celebrity that tho production ofan original drama from his prole topen is ever regarded as one of tho most important events In the theatricl year. Hence, although the publio of the present day is generally somewhat apathetic on the subject of new plays, the Haymarket theatre was crowded 7a every part on Saturday night by a multitude eager to witness 3r. Taylor's long-announced oomedy, An UaJequal lfatch. Moreover, there was an additiontl eircenmstanco of interest conneoted with this partioular prodoction. Miss Amy Sedgwick, who by her performance in the Lady of Zyons and the Love Chase had made a greater impression on the publfe that any actress who has appeared for a considerable number of years, was for the first time to sustain an original part. The first "oreation," a the French would call it, always marlks an Important epoch In the career of a theatrical artist. On the rise of the curtain it was evident that the menager had set no little Yalue on the new plece, and was determined to give it every advantage in the shape of accessory decoration. The scene repre. i sented a mountinous landscape, exceedingly well painted by Mr. Morris, the foreground of which vas occupied by the inn and smithy of a Yorkshire village. Amid these green mountains the first act, which is In the natare of a French prologue, begins, Heeter (Mfiss Amy Sedgwick), I daughter of Grazebrook (Mr. Rogers), the village blacksmith, has two admirers. One is Dr. Boerhaave Botcherly (Mr.' Buckstone) the k;sculapius of the spot, who, finding that his passion is not returned, soon subsides into the faithfuli friend and counseller; the other Is HArry Arneliffe (Mr. W. Farren), a romantic young gentleman of small means and high family, for whom, though she is not blind to the differenoe of their social conditions, Rester conceives a deep affeotion. ArnUliffe'A intentions are sictly honourable, his civility in carrying Hester's mllkp asnid the derision of certain fuhionable friends being followed by a formal offer of marriage, which Is joyfully aocepted. The lovers are rap. turously contemplating a sort of " love-in-a-cottager existence, to which pigs, cows, ana pouitry win give an ineffable charm, when news arrives that Arneliffi's uncle, a 'wealthy baronet is deceased, leaving him a rich inheritance. The fashionable friends now begin to fancy that Arpcliffe will back out of his marriage with the blaoksmith's daughter, and Hester herself is not without misgivings. But the r,ithful lover, in spite of the beneicence of fortune, which has made of him " Sir Harry," ticks to hi purpoe and an the presence of his sneering acquaintance renews his offer, boldly asking the baud of llester from her father the blacksmith. ITo difference will he occasioned by the deah of the old baronet, save that there will bo love in a manor. house with a baokground of safisfied creditors, in lieu of "love in a cottsge," with a ccompaniment of restless T6 Arncliffe Manor-house (after a 13pse of IS months) we are removed, and now we find that the romantic passion, which seemed so delightful In the first act, is not without its Inoonvenientresults. Hester, now LadyArncliffe, has to practise scales, on the piano and scales are a " bore."( She loves better to make hay at 6 o'clock in the moraing, and the predUction is not genteeL Moreover though she ha Ea housefull of fashionable visitors, she manifests very lax notions as to the duties of a hostess, keeping her guests waiting for breakfast half-an-hour beyond the proper time, and then rushingQin upon them with tumbled gown and disordered hamr. This line of conduct and the animandveraions to which it leads are observed with secrct dissatisfaction by Sir HerLy Arneliffe, who, now the flush of romanuce ias over, begins quietly to contrast the behaviour of his uncultivated spouse with that of the accomplished Mrs. Topham Montresor thEs. Bucklcigham White), much to the disadvantage of the ormer, wFho, he suggests should take the latter for her modeL The arrival,of Hester's fatheron a visit to his child does not greatly improve the general position. Everybody knows that the worbhy Grazebrook is a blacksmith, and the daughter's joyful reception of her humble father in the midst of her genteel acquaintance gives one pang more to the fastidious Sir Harry, who takes occasion to lecture his wife on the duty of repressing natural emotionA and conforming to the exigencies of an artificial society, still holding up Mru. Montresor as a standard of perfection. Hester is not conInced, but irritated - nay she is rendered jealous by the frequent recurrence of iirs gontresor's name. She recollrets that her husband prior to his marriage was a suitor for the hand of this very lady, but was rejected on account of hlis poverty, and has reason to believe that Mrs. Montresor, who is not over scrupulous in her love of conquest, Is taldng advantage of her sojourn in Arnoliffe Manorhouse to recover a heart that she has once let slip. Feelings lead to words, and altercation ensues between Hester and Mrs. Montresor, in the course of which the latter is ordered to quit the premises. To effect the removal, however, the aid of Dr. Botcherly, who is now in the house as ifrs. Montresor's own medical adviser, is found necessary. This eminent physician, trae to the interests of Hester, advises her fashionable rival to visit Ems for the benefit of her health. Ms. Montresor dep3rts on the strength of this advice, and now Hester fancies that the only cause of unhappiness is removed. Poor deluded soul ! Her husband, who has a pulmonary complaint that, without proper care, may terminate in consumption, has received a letter from his physician (not Botcherly) to the effect that the waters of Ems can alone save his life. That Hester may not be alarmed by the discovery that he is threatened with one of the most terrible of maladies he states his sudden obliga. tion to visit Ems alone without assigning a caaEo, and then abruptly quits bis home. With the misery of Hester, in consequence of the natural, though incorrect, suspicion that her husband is gone to join Mrs. Montresor, the second act comes to a conclusion. A twelvemonth's interval is supposed to elapse before the curtain is raised for the third act. The scene of action is now a German watering-place. In the background is a Rhenish landscape of mountain and river; in the foreground an hotel, with its appurtenances of continental waiters, &c. The watering place thus beautifully situated (thanks to the pencil of Mr. O'Connor) is not to be found in the map or Germany. Its name is Seidlitz-Stinkingen, and It owes its origin to the scientific acumen of our old friend Dr. Botcherly, who, having ascertained that the nastiest waters are invariably considered the most efficacious, has been fortunate enough to discover a spring surpassing all others in offensive qualities and has thereupon written a book. By this medico-literary operation the smallest and poorest of duchies has been converted into au opulent State; for Britons have poured In to taste the newlv-discovered waters, foreigners nave followed to devour Britons, and hotels have risen from the ground for the accommodation of both. As for the happy discoverer, whom in act i. we saw hiding his genius beneath a rustic garb, and who in act ii. was rendered serious by orthodox black, he is now clad in semi-military uniform, with a formidablo cocked hat on his head and a constellation of orders on hisbreast, as chief inspector of the ducal baths. In this new Elysium Sir Harry Arncliffe has taken up his temporary abode, having changed since we saw him last from the most fastidious of gentlemen into a longbearded, cap-wearing, pipe-smoking lounger of the Rhine. With Mrs. Montresor, whom he has met at Ems, he is on friendly terms; but that aspiring lady now seeks to capture German grand dukes rather than English baronets, while, o-n the other hand, Sir Harry is so completely heat-whole that hemabcioosly hopes to see 3rs. Montresor eclipsed at the d-:cal Court by an English lady of fashion, who is expected every moment, and who is mentioned in all the papers as "die schone Engl,inderin." When the beauty arrives she proves to be no other than Hester, now apparently transformed into a heartless lady of high society, without a single natural feelng. Her husband's advice to adopt an artificial mode of conduct she carries out with a zeal that now drives bini to destraction. His German undress and pipe she despises as uncouth and disgusting, and, what is worst of a1l, she seems in a fair way to become the avowed mistress of the Grand Duke of Seidlitz-Stinkingen. Frankenstein was not more horrified at the man-monster of his creatioa than is Sir Harry at the living result of his own counsels. He longs to see tne Hester of former days restored to his arms, and of course she is restored. Her heartless conduct was merely assumed to work a reformationi; aud her husband, taught at last that a good heart is better than good manners, may now be hapf for as long a life as his phthisicky constitution will aow him. The moral purpose of this pleoe-namely, the elevation of native goodness above artificialbreeding-is romewhat trite, and has been more rapidly effected in the little French piece familiar to the English in the version of the Rough Diamond. But by husbanding his very simple theme, and placing the chief points of its development under circumstances rendered mosb diverse from each other by varfety of local colouring, Mr. Taylor has produced a plaiwhich, although long beyond the average, is amusing to the end. The first act, laid in the midst of an Engli3h rural district, is almost dllic with its tale of simple love; the second, laid in a manor-house peopled with Iondon guests, has more of the normal character of high comedy, and most forcibly exhibits the collision that lies at the foundation of the plot; the third, laid in the vicinity of the Rhine, would have flagged had the author still confined hlmselE to the conduct of his story, but a now source of amusement arises from the exhibition of the pomps and vanities of a petty German principality, and the interest, no longer concentrated in the principal figares, is still kept alive by the circumstances under which they move. As a comedy representing actual life, this last worn of Mr. Taylor cannot be considered equal to his Victims; but, as a plesant series of pictures, sldlfully connected, aud enlivened with a groat deal of sparkling dialogue, it wiU probably surpass Ti popularity that excellent play. The element of "drame" that belongs to its oomposition and distinguishes it from pure comedy may be regarded ather in its favour than otherwise when we take into consideration the prevalling taste of tho public. The character of Hester requires no smaU ability on the part of the actress who sustains it. In the first act she is the pretty rustic placed amid a scene that confers additional Instre to her charms-a village beauty, marred by no humi. hating contrast. In the second act she is the pretty zustio out of place, and not a little fretted, but stilU fond and affectionate as ever, until jealousy of Mrs Montresor converts her Into an indwgnant wife. Ln the third aot the rustic is lost altogether, and we have the woman of fashion, with whom manner is everything. Now, when wre say that Miss Amy Sedgwick went through all these phases in a most satisfactory manner, as If perfectly at home in each of them, and marking out each of them as distinctly as possible, we give this young and rising actress the highest commendation. Scarcely less various in its aspects is the character of Harry Arneliffe and very ably does Mr. W. Farren pourtray in succession the ardent, romantic lover, the fastidiots husband, and the easy, sauntering Briton of a German watering plaoe. In all the parts he undertakes Mr. W. Farren is earnest, careful, and gentlemanlike, and his progress from an actor of mere second-rate personages to a responsible artist, worthy to be intrusted with the safety of an important piece, has been steady and unfluctuatang. The desciption of the German spring is delivered with inlinite humour by Mr. Buckstone, whose gxandeur as the ducal inspector is irresistibly comic; but renerally the Pharagt*r of Dr, Botcherly is more arduous tiu effective, He is the chain that connects the other personages togetl but his own peculiarities are not very distinctly ront4, o.E. On the other hand, there is an excellent little a o3 a pompoUs Valet, in the shape of a certain Mr. Blen]J Pop, "own gentleman" to Sir Harry, who is p.l by Mr. Coinpton with a consummate gravity tba I stercotyped on eveTy line of the dull countenavA and even tinges the passion of the "oown gentlenau" fd Be.asy.

THE BISE IN THE BANK BATE OF DISCOU". (From the Economist.) The knowledge for some days past that notwithstanding. the high rate to which the Bank had raised the rate of d{scount bullion has stlU been leavng this conntrv bothfcr he Contire7nt and the United States-the sometwhat lesfavourable accounts which the hastarrivalsfromAmenicas. have brought-the facttbat in some places onthe Cotient.u . and especially atHamburg, the rate of disoount had reache& 9 per oent-and the certainty that at lesst for some time,. to come the drain of silver to the EAst, producing indirectly a demand for gold here, woould continue unabated-hadi re pared the public for the farther rise of one per cent, wrlch was made on Thursday in the minimum rate of Rink, discount, and whioh now stauds at 9 per oent. The hlghest rate ever before known in modern times was 8 per cent., at which it stood for four weeks, from the 23d of October 1847, until the 20th of November, when it was reduce&to 7 per cent. In that year, through the whole of the* months of Angust and September, and up to the middle of October, the rate of discount was only 5o per cent. ; and when it is rememSered how much more seven> was the presure at that timo than now, and how much more detrimental and destructive to private* interests, we have a s;riking example of the fect that it is, not a high rate of interest that creates panics and distrust, though it may arise out of them. There is no more reason:. why a rate o discount of 9 per cent. should derange a tradet otherwise sound, however it may for the time somewhat diminish its profits, than there is why a very high price of grain for a season "hould ruin a nation otherwise wealthy, though it may somewhat reduce that wealth. Both must Sq1y be rzegarded as an exceptional state of things, as - evils less or more to be suffered, but not to be evaded by an- with the laws of free supply and demand; ntlotthe greatest risk, nay the certainty, of aggravatng tbem. We are glad to see that the money-dealers in Lombard- stret and the joint-stock ban7ia, who have s'osumned the im. - portant position of holders of the spare floating capital of the country seeking employment, and who have thus become the agents between the portion of the public who are lendme - and the portion who are borrowers, have acted promptly, and have come to the resolution of allowing 8 per cent, for "money at ca3L" This step is much more imaportant than aq first sight maybe apparent. A rise in the rate of discount leads to a fall In the price of securitles,,-and a fall in the price of Eecurities affords anew inducementfor personswhose, money is lying " at call" and available for trade purposes to withdraw It and inveet it in securities. WVe have heard much of late ef the public being free buyers of Consols. But as it rarely happens that any money is actually held iri. private hoards in this country, btt is either placed with. bankers or with money-dealers, the purchase of securities. merns the withdrawal from those channels of temporary investment. It is true that the mere purchase of securities absorbs no capital in the first instance. If there is a buverwho pays his money, there is also a seller who receives Isi monei, and, so far, the effectupon the money-market should e n u Bt at times like the present it frequeDtly hape that the seLer of securities operates with a view to sending his capItal ahroad, eitherto meet the demands of correspondents, or more frequently to profit by investment on favourable terms in foreign stocks, In that case the indirect effect of the public withdrawing their money from bankers andc money-dealers, in order to invest in Conscls, is to enable sales to be made here for the purpose of investment abroadtransactions which lead directly to an export of gold. The only legitimate check which can be put upon such opera. tions, fair in themenelves, is that the inaucement to continueto keep money in the hauds of bamkers and money-dealers should bo maintained by a rate of interest proportionate to the real v'liue of money in the market. We believe it would be very difficult to estimate the full advantage which the country has derived from its coniparativelynew practice of allowing a rate of interest on "money at call" fluc'uating with, but always closely approximating to, the Bauk rate. By it large mn-es of capital are retained in channels oftrade which would otheraise, and especially at suchL moments as the present, seek permanent investments in fixed seourities at home or abroad. Thii old faUacy Is again revived, as it always is at such moments, of a further issue of paper money. This fallacy might ere now have worn itself out but for the unhappy encouragement given by the unsound theory uponwhich thei Bank Act of 1844 attempted to base a sound rule of practice for the Bank to follow. Every one whose opinion Is worth anything row admits that the Bank has no power to increase its circulation of notes, so long as they are redeemable in gold; the strongest advocates of the Act of 1844 tell us, and tell Us trnly, that if the Bank had the free power of issue at this moment, they could not increase the circulation of paper by a single 5l.-nota. An evening contem- porary says, and says truly:-"If the Bank of England' were persuaded to extend its is.acs instead of raising Its rate of dircount, what would be the effect ? Not a single 5!,note the more would there be In the country. The only difference would be that the gold would go out of the island, to Europe and America, with an incre-sing impett.." Now this is no doubt perfectly true. But then if the Bank cannot increase the circulation, what is the value of the restriction upon which the whole theory haugs ? It cannot be said that it is In order to prevent the exportation of gold, because the Bank Is left with full discretion to discount as much paper a- it pleases, and at vwhatever rate it pleases, and thus to place bnllion at the command of ecporters io any extent it pleases. In these transaotions ILt nas only the discretion of the directors to guide it, and thatthat discretion has been exercised for the public benefit no one will deny. But howr has thls been done ? By the only true method of correcting adverse exchanges and preventing an undue abstraction of capital, raising its price so as to t. -a away the inducement to export. Agreeing so much as we do rlth the general objects of those who framed the Actof 1844, we cannot but regret that the theory adopted is so. much calculated to give an importance to bank-notes whlchs they do not possess, and thus to encourage the dangerous fallacy, thata pressure for capital can be alleviated by additional issues of paper. Any one who is acquainted with the operations of the Bank of England must know that an enormious awoont of notes flow out every day, but flow back again In the shape of deposits of bankers or others; and it must be plain to the commonest observer that If the transactions of the country reaUy required more than are at present in circulation, that additional quantity would be retainedby the public to whom. they are advanoed. What Is really wanted at such a time as the present is bullion, and not paper. Of what service would ban n",tes be to those who wish to make payments in New York or oLthe Contlient, except that they could exchange them for gold ? But if the Bank is propased to part with its gold on terms that will suit the remitter, it can as well be obtained direct, without the intervention of banknotes; and to that the law offers no impediment. We do not deny, on the contrary we have often urged, the great economy which might be effected in the circulation of the country by well. secured notes of a lower denomination. Such notes would perform the uame service as is now done by gold, and, to wbatever extent they could be usefully and safey introduced, bulUion wruld he economnized, and rendered effective as capital for all the purposes of trade abroad and at home. But let it never be lost sight of, that at this moment the struggle which is really going on is one between different countries for the nossessior of the precious metals, in order to tide over a period when the usual channels of credit are deranged by extraordinary and temporary events. That this country is intrinsicaUy better off 2s regards its obliga, tions and financial position than almost any other, we believe there can be no doubt; and the real question for us to determino Is this-shaU we woUow others, in order to aid thelr necesslbles, to outbid us in our own market for our own money, and permit ouselves to be drained until our com. merce is placed In the same jeopardy and danger as that oE some other countries wvhich bave been less uradeut or lems fortunate than ourselves? The pressure wvhich has already been placed upon the Bank, even at the high rate of discount new charged, ls best shownu by the fact that the advances upon private securities have increased in 11 days by the large sum of 2,0S9,1971.
