West Coast Of Africa.
WEST COAST OF AFRICA.
[From our second edition of yesterday.]
PLYMOUTH, TUESDAY MOE$MG.
The African mail steamship Etbhiope, Captain Barnwell, arrived here at midnight, with the mails, from the West Coast of Africa and Teneriffe.
Her dates are :-Old Calabar, Dec. 29th; Cameroons, Dec. 30th; Fernando Po, Jan. 4th; Bonny, Jan. 5th; Lagos, Jan. 8th; Accra, Jan. 10th; Sierra Leone, Jan. 20th; Bathurst, Jan. 23d; Teneriffe, Jan. 30th; and Madeira, Feb. 1st. -
She brings 2,174 ounces of gold, and a cargo including four tons of ivory, 371 casks of palm oil, 60 cases of cayenne, 41 cases of arrowroot, 89 bags of cochineal, pineapples, beeswax, and sundries.
The coast continues in an unsettled state. Trade is dull at Liberia, and brisk at the Cameroons, where the rivers are healthy.
Her Majesty's ships Scourge, Hecla, and Myrmidon were at Sierra Leone; the Firefly, Prometheus, and Bloodhound were at Lagos; the Mfedusa, at Bathurst; and Trident and Eclipse at Madeira. The African mail packet Niger was at Liberia Jan. 15th; the Candace left Madeira at 10 a.m., Jan. Slst; the merchant ship Fanny was at Old Calabar; the bark Lord Elgin, at Bonny; the ibrig Dromo, at Accra; the brigs Thomas Snooks and Africanus, at Cape Coast Castle; the ships Madras and Gentoo at Sierra Leone; and the barks Governor M'Donald, Emily, and Elizabeth, at Bathurst.
In 38 N. lat. the Ethiope experienced for 36 hours a strong gale from S.W. to NB.E, in which she lost a topsail and split her jib.

Astley's Amphitheatre.
A4TLEY'S AMPHITHEATRE.
Within the last few months a new dramatic principle has governed the stage performances at this equestrian establishment. The pieces once current at Astley's might be divided into two classes. Either they were melodrames of a romantic kind, in which a horse was a principal character; or they were military spectacles, in which an attempt was made to give dramatic form to the campaigns of the day, or, at any rate, of a recent period. Mazeppa and the BatWe of Waktr70o, though first brought out in the old days of Mr. Ducrow, stiU remain in the repertory of the house as stock specimens of each class, and during the late war in the Crimea the military genus was represented anew by mock engagements on the Alma and at Inkerman. One subdivision of the romantic class has, moreover, been especially enconraged by the present manager, Mr. W. Cooke, namely, the melodrame, in whioh the horse is not only a prominent figure on the stage, but gives extraordinary indications of c-intelligence and real dociity.
However, both c asses with their subdivisions have recently disappeared from Astley's domain. The military spectacles went out rather before the war itself and as for the romantic dramas, they have perished from sheer exhaustion. Every trick that horse can achieve and every species of interest in which a horse can stand as the central point seem to have been brought before the public till the power of excitement is destroyed by familiarity.
Under these circumstances some new course has been manifestly requisite, and, accordingly, hIr. W. Cooke has formed a third class of plays by selecting celebrated works from the general dramatic stock, and fitting them out with horses whenever an occasion presents itself. The first experiment of the kind was made with Cibber's Richard III., in which " White Surrey" attained a visible existence; thc second with Afacbeth, which proved less fitted for equestrian illustration; thethird achievement was Kat7hrine and Petruchio, in which Grumio's narrative of the faUenhorse was changed into an actual scene; and, fourthly, we have now the musical drama Rob Roy with nearly all the songs and choruses thereto appertaining. The incident of Rob
oX's escape by leaping from the horse on which he is borne as a piasoner into the stream is restored in the Astley's version, and this, with the mounting of Cantain Thornton's troop generally, constitutes the chief modification that the drama receives from its transposition to an equestrian establishment.
As a consequence of this new system of producing plays, originally non-equestrian, with incidental horses, the histrionic character of the house bas decidedly risen. Mr. Holloway, whose ambition was first created by tho character of Richard III., and subsequently nurtured by Macbeth, is an effective representative of the Macgregor; and it should be observed that he not only acts the part, but leaps the leap, without any subterfuge in the shape of double or dummy. Baaie Nicol Jarvie is played with a great deal of humour and with exceeding carefulness by Mr. Anson, the regular low comedian of the establishment, who has never been seen under such favourable circumstances. Dougal, s represented by Mr. Hemmings, is marked by all the wildness proper to this low specimen of humanity. The most striking songs belong, it wil be remembered, to Francis Osbaldistone, and, that the srduous duties of this young gentleman may be adequately performed, Mr. Eburne, a vocalist with a
vey_ood teno voice, has been engaged for the occasion. lr. Dowton is a formidable Helen Macgregor.
The Astl eys Bob B2o0y is certainly a 1" hit.'" The play is full of that hlustle that especialy appeals to the Transpotine taste, and the music is, in the strongest sense o the word, popular. Thus the wthole work moves pleasantly along, ana the audience cheer the heroisms of Mr. Holloway, laugh at the drolleries of Mr. Anson, and honour with an encore the "RBed, red rose" of Mlr. Elbune.

AMATEUR MUSICAL SOCIETY.
The members of this society began the regular concert season auspiciously, with a prrformance of varied attractions, which took place on hionday night at the Hanover. square-rooms in presence of a crowded and fasbionable assembly. The programme deserves quoting:-

Although the amateurs, carried away by their enthuSias, no doubt prefer exhibiting before tho patrons of the society in the more imaginative and modem works of Beethoven and Mendelssohn-to master the difdiculties of which, even tolerably, carries with it a certain degree of honour-we may fairly remind them that they are most at ease, and consequently successful, in the orchestral symphonies of Haydn. A happier choice than the ninth of the famous set, composed for Saiamon could scarcely have been made. Genial, spirited, and urnaffected music from first to last, it was playe throughout with congenial heartiness, and apparently enjoyed by the performers and the audience in an equal measure. Signor Piatti's Italian song-which is rather graceful than onginal-was honoured by an encore. It was intrusted to Miss Leffler (daughter of the well-known public sEnger), a young lady with a voice of such good quality that eat thinigs mUay be expected from her provided she taZs pains to cultivate it. The violoncello obbligato (well written, it is almost superfluous to say, Signor Piatti being the composer) was executed with remarkable facility and taste by Lord Gerald FitzgeraldI one of the most practised amateur violonce?Uists in England. Captain Harry lAe Carter has loing enjoyed a reputation in di2eftanie circles as a flautist, and his performance of Boehm's "variations' (Air TVrpolicn), upon the so-called "new silver cylinder flute," on the present occasion-if the flatte
applause which ensued may be accepted as a test-showed
at in te opinion of the audience his reputation was not withot goo warant. ord GraldFitzgerald's"1 Introductitont anodMatrch,"of wvhiich afavourable opinion has

The freshest feature, and indeed the gem of the programnme, was Hummel's pianoforte concerto, terminating with the well-known rondo alla Spagniola, which is infinitel,y more clever than Spanish. Hummel's music, thougn not to be compared with that of the greatest masters, approaches nearer to their standard in its general characteristies than that of the majority of pianoforte colaposers. It certainly forms an epoch in the history of the instrument, and in the present dearth much of it might be revived with singular advantage. Snch a work as the concerto in A flat, while decidedly unimaginative is nevertheless far preferable to the strange inventions which are daily attempted to be palmed off upon the world as the productions of original genius. lummel's music is graceful, fluent, clearly defined, written with the learning and judgment of a thoroughiy trained musician, and almost always ingenious and pleasing. To higher qualites it can rarely pretend, bat these are sufficient to preserve it from oblivion. Miss Angelina Levy, the pianist last night, had a less difficult task to accomphsh than when she first astonished the amateurs and their friendsinthe second concerto of Mendelssohn; for, though there is invariably a series of ;set" bravura passages in Hummel, and nothing of the sort in his more intellectual successor, it is easier to master a composition that may he studied piecemeal than one which, like the concerto of Mendelssohn, must be surveyed and understood as a whole before any part of it can be attempted with success. Those who were acq uainted with the talents of Miss Angelina Levy were therefore not at all surprised at the perfect ease and brilliancy with which she rendered the concerto of Hunmmel from beginnin to end-and that too, in the face of a continual unsteaamess and want of finish in the orchestral accompaniments (Hummel's most elaborate and well considered, by the way) which would have unsettled, if not absolutely diemayed, an "amateur" with less solid pretensions to be entitled "professor." This performance made a general sensation and Miss Levy retired amid reiterated plaudits, which had been richly and honourably earned.
In Mr. Wesley's elegant song Miss Leffler confirmed the good impression she had made in the first part of the concert. Of Mlr. Henry Leslie's choir it is unnecessary to restate our high opinion. The least meritoriowu of the partsongs for male voices, sung to such perfection last night-a viz., alocken's " War Song," a pretentions common-place-. was encored- the melodious and wholly unpretending setting of "Ynteger vitre, scelerisque p urns" (or4ce, Ode. 22), even better delivered than the other, was not half so warmly appreciated. In Auber's overture, the orcliestri suited themselves with an "ealco commodo," or convemient allegro, which, while it robbed their task of its difficulty, robbed the music of its spirit and character. As the gentleman p layers are evidently improving, they should not throw a chance awlay, oz incuz the rjkkof forfeitin9 singlel<?,aurl. r?hTRhtey ought by this te is pvlforin t4

Election Intelligence.
ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
GRERNWWTflT.
The oUing for this borough commenced yesterday morning at o'clock. Thouzh at the nomination the ,howof bands was greatly In avour of Colonel Sleigh, yet it was generally considered that he stood no chance at the polL There was, in fact, just su'ficient excitement to obstruct much of the business of the town withoutin theleast affecting the result as to General Codrington's return. All that gentleman's sup porters therefore took the matter very coolly and the regular constitutional bustle was only maintained by the adherents of his opponent, who, to do them bare justice, exerted themselves in that respect most astonishingly. Raggedminstrels sang a disnal refrainabout the roads, the burden of which was " So let Greenwich happy be, and go and vote for Colonel Sleigh," while one or two sallow-looking ruffians paraded the streets in donkey-carts, holding up a huge cat-o -ninetails, which was popularly regarded as a biting sarcasm upon General Codrington, and cheered accordingly. Occasionally, too, one saw a lively drawing representing a much ensanguined private soldier apparently undergoing the extreme sentence of the law by means of the lash, and which bloodthirsty piece of business it was furthermore intimated was the daily solace and amusement of the gallant generaL Nevertheless, in spite of these and similar efforts, the poll at 10 o'clock showed amajorityfor Codrington of 530,-the numbers being, Codrington, 1,01M; Sleigh, 485. At 11 matters were even worse for the Colonel, who had polled only 731, while Codrington had 1,631, giving a maiority of 903, which at 12 oclock was increased to 1,072.
It was thought that these discouraging figures for Colonel Sleigh would be altered at 1 o'clock, when the dockyard labourers, who, it was believed, were mostly in his favour, came to the poll; but the return for that time showed l no diminution of hisopponent's success, who had then a majority of 1,140. Sleigh's supporters accordingly fell to yelling and hootin at the voters for the General, whioh, as their numbers were considerable, found them ample ocenpation,, but made no difference in the steadily increasing majority. The proceedings accordingly were beginning to flag, when an individual who styled himself " One of the people" enlivened them by weeping out of a publichouse window in front of the hustings, and adjuring the populace not to have something or other done to them with a " shackle." This moving caution, coupled with dark hints as to a Government "screw," seemed to find a responsive echo in the hearts of all Colonel Sleigh's supporters, who were supposed to be suffering under theinfliction of the ironmongery alluded to, and who cheered the orator so vehemently that he returned to the figure again and agaiu, until its effect was somewhat diminished even in an audience prepared to shout for everything. Colonel Sleigh also drove about in a post chaise and four perpetually, and seemed to be doing his utmost to fulfil the difticult peculiarities of Sir Boyle lioche's bird, and be in two p laces at once.
At 3 o'clock the state of the poll showed a majority for General Codringtou of 1,311; and at the close the total numbers stood thus:
M1aierity for Codrington. Sleigh. Codrington, Greenwich ,. ,. 628 445 183 Deptford .. .. 745 655 90 Woolwich . , 1,602 443 1,159
Total ... 2,975 1,543 1,432
These numbers were not made public until 5 o'clock, but directly 4 had struck a rnsh was made to the hustings, when the supporters of Colonel Sleigh, feeling that all was over, shouted and yelled most furionsly.
General CODIRNGTON therefore retired to his committee, where he briefly thanked his supporters.
Colonel SLEIGH attempted to speak, but his ardent admirers erred on the wrong side, and cheered so continuaUy and at such inconvenient periods that it was quite impossible to make out a word of what the defeated candidate said. We were informed that he expressed his intention to petition at once against the return of his opponent, on the ground of bribery and corruption.
A Mr. TowssEND called upon the electors for three groans for the Government, which were given in that very mixed st7le which usually takes place when a mob prepared to cheer is suddenly called upon without due notice to reverse its expression of feeling. The same gentleman also alluded with great force and success to the Government "screw," which he intimated ani attempt had been made even to apply to him, and much to the same effect, including a glowing eulogium on the " talent, genius, firmness, and determination" of the defeated candidate.
A very general opinion seemed to prevail, even among the warm supporters of General Codrington, that had that gentleman been opposed by any man of mark and influence be would have been easily defeated; but, as it was, he obtamed a Lsage majority, the electors seeming to think that, as between Sir Wiliam and his opponent, they had nothing but that unpleasant choice popularly known as " Hobson's."
SOUTHAMPTON.
The contest has resulted in the return of Mr. T. M. Weguelin, the Governor of the Bank of England. The poDling commenced at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, and was kept up with great vigour throughout the day. Sir Edward Butler took the lead at starting, Mr. Weguelin having the .eecond place, and Mr. R. Andrews third. These relative positions were maintained until 2 o'clock, when a large number of voters from the docks (several of whom had just arrived in the Colombo steamer) flocked to the different pollingbooths in support of Mr. Weguelin, and at half-past V that gentleman for the first time headed Sir Edward Butler. From this moment the election was looked upon by those conversant with election tactics as decided, as those Liberals who had reserved their votes for the purpose of giving them to either of the Liberal candidates who might require them, to prevent the success of a Tory, now commenced poUing for Mr. Weguelin, and his majority over Sir Edward steadily incredsed. The most conflicting statements were issued during the day; but we believe that the following state of the poll, put ont by Mr. Weguelin's committee, at its final close at 4 o'clock wiUl be found substantially correct:-
Wegue}in....,,,..1,000 Buter. ... ... 966 Andrews... ,,, ... ... ... 818
Giving Mr. Weguelin a majority of 34 over Sir Edward Butler, and 182 over Mr. Andrews. The official declaration of the pol by the returning officers, which will be made this morning at the Guildhall, will no doubt slightly change the figures, but not the result or the relative proPOrtion.
Trhe town was in a state of intense excitement, and most of the shops in the main street were closed all day- t*hose tradesmen who were exceptions pUtting up their Asntters at mid-day, when the crowds in the streets were increasing by thousands, and became every moment more dense. The excitement was at its height between 2 and 4 o'clock, when MY. Weguelin and Sir Edward Butler were treading so closely on each other's heels, and every vehiole which passed along, conveying voters to and from the poll, was enthusiastically cheered by the respective supporters of each candidate.
At the close of the poll there was an immense assemblage in the IHigh-street in front of the committee-rooms of Mr. Weguelin and Sir Edward Butler, which are on opposite sides of the street. Mr. Weguelin addressed the crowd from the balcony of the Star Hotel, which was filed bv the members of his committee and others of his supporters, thanking them for thehonourwhichhad beenconferredupon him, and promisin to show his gratitude for the support they had given hium by a zealous and vigilant discharge of the duties which attacbed to the high and honourable position in which he had been placed by the electors of Southampton.
Seldom has the constituency been so thoroughly polled out. As we stated yesterday, the total number of voters on the register is 3,508, which, deducting 150 for double entries, is reduced to 3,358. It wil be seen that nearly 2,800 persons voted, leaving only about 500 unpoUed, including deaths and changes since the register was made, and al other causes; and the absentees from the town form no smaU proportion of this number, there always being so many voters aboard the various mail steamers which ply to and from this port.
While Mr. Weguelin was addressing the crowd, after 4 o'clock, a large omnibus, filled with a set-of roughs exhibiting Sir Edward Butler's colours, and " Hlarry Broome" and " Jerry Noon," the prize-fighters from London, mounted on the box drove up, but could not pass through the crowd. They then dismounted from the vehicle, and commenced fighting right and left, when two policemnen came up and manfully collared one of the " gentlemen of the P. Sc ,' and amid the cheers of the populace carried him off to the stationhouse, where he novw remains.
One or two men were given into custody during the day for personating voters.

NEWPORT (ISLE OF WIGHT.)
Monday being the day appointed by the Mayor of Newport for the nomination of a fit and proper person to reprosent this borough in Parliament in the room of Mr. Biggs, of Leicester, resigned, great excitement was caused in this very excitable little borough._
ir. Seeley, a native of the Isle of Wight (a Liberal), was evidently the candidate- of the populace, who assembled round the hustings, and greeted him with much applause on arriving at the Guildhall with his friends.
Mr. Kennard (Conservative) was received almost without any demonstration.
Mr. Kinglske expressed his intention of not going to the oll, in order that there might not be any "split" in the Liberal interest.
At noon the 3fayor (Mr. W. B. MEw) opened the proceedmgs, and hoped each candidate and his supporters would be heard wnth patience and propriety.
The wt havng been read,
Mr. PITrS nominated Mr. Robert W. Kennard, who was seconded by Mn ELnDRxIDG town-clerk of Newport.
Dr. WVL nominated, and Mr. PfiIOCK seconded Mr. Seeley.
Mr. K DirAain then addressed the electors, and, a&er remarking that Mr. Seeley might havo an advantage over him in being a resident among them, said that they required a manto represent them in Parliament who was capable of looking carefully after the manner in. which the public money was expended; who having had, like himself, large affairs in his hands to conduct, and been connected with other countries, was well able to grapple with those questions. He expressed his inion that it was desirable to preserve our national def&nces inthe highest state of efficiency and vigour, so that this country -might maintain its proud position among nations.

respect to the Sunday observance question, be said he had travelled through many foreign countries and had seen tho ill effects of its desecration. This, he would remind them, was peculiarly a question for the consieration of the working manr. They must remember the Sabbath was made for man, and not men forthe Sabbath, and that if they got rid of therightfulobservance of that day, with all its benefits, they Would only bring upon themselves seven days' labour for Six daye' pay, and they would also lose the benefit which might arise from the Saturday half-holyday movement. He referred to the accusation that had been made against him of having employed his own men upon the Sabbath, and gave it an unqualified deniaL He had not done so even during the height of the war, when he had so

Mr. SEELEY, on presenting himself, was received with rounds of cheers, mingled with disapprobation, but the former predominated. Hfe said he should have no difficulty in maaing them understand what his opinions were, but he thought they would have greater difficulty with reference to his opponent. With regard to the ballot, Mr. Kennard had said Aj was a uestion open to discussion; he, however, believedit had beensufficientlydiscussed ands hould therefore vote in its favour. (Cheers.) On the subject of the suiage M1r. Kennard had said he would give his atten. lion to any well-devised plan that might be brought forward; but they must renmember that Mr. Kennard himself "as to be the 4ud e of this plan; not they. Mr. Kennard had said be would? vote foi- the abolitionx of church-rates if ny substitute were found for them; but he (Mr. Seeley) thought they ought to be at once abolshed. They both agreed, however, on the necessity for law reforms, and he believed that was one of the few things in which they did coincide. fri. Seele°y then reviewed wrieaz Mr. Kennard's op0raons as expressed at a meeting held at the Star Hotel, w ere he bad said he was in favour of an increase in the national defences, of an extension of free trade, of the abolition of the income-a Bet he did not understand how he couldI reconcile the one with the other, or how he could possibly carry them all out. He (Mr. Seeley) was in favour of a decrease in the expediture, so that the p eet war taxation might bere ducee as hebelieved the dress which at present prevailed arose from the pressure occasioned by the war taxation. Mr. Seelev then referred to the Sabbath question, which had been made such a point of by his opponent, but Which he believed to be an unimportant qruestion ("'Oh, oh 1"), and he would be anch better pleased if the question were not brought forward in Parlia. ment at all; but he was in favour of opening the Crystal Palace and British Museum on Sundays, &c.
On a show of hands being taken it was declared to be in favour of Mr. Seeley. A poll was then demanded on behalf of Mr. Kennard, which opened yesterday morning at the usual hour, with the following results:-

WEST KENT.
The nomination for a representative of this division of the county of Kent is fixed to take place at noon on Monday next, at Penenden-heath, near Maidstone. The polling will take place in the various districts on the following Thursday, and, by a recent act of Parliament, will be confined to one day only.
NORTH LEICESTERSHIRE.
The supporters of Mr. Frewen base his claims to the sufTrages of the electors on his extreme Protestant notions, and are continually taunting Lord John Manners and his friends with his Lordship's attachment to High Churchism. In consequence of this, deputations of influential electors waited upon Lord John to elicit his opinions respecting the leading religious topics of the day, more especially as regards Ireland. Lord John's answers were deemed satisfactory to the deputation, and were published. Two other points are now started-namely, the malt-tax and the income-tax, to both of which the noble Lord is said, by the Frewen party, to give but little opposition. This is, however, desonbed as "a weak invention of the enemy--a mere election move." Mr. Frewen has addressed the electors both at ILeicester and elsewhere, explaining his political views and stating his determinationto go to the poL

The nomination for the borough of Downpatrick took place on Moonday, when Mr. Her and Mr. Johunsne were duly proposed and seconded. The show of hands having been declazed in favour of the Orange champion, a poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Eer. Contrary to anticipation, there was no rioting, at least during the frst day's pro-

Irish And Scotch Agricultural Statistics.-
IRISH Awn SCOT=x AGRICuLTuRAz STATISrcs.- A return published yesterday shows that last year there were under crops in Ireland the following quaptities of land-namely, 529,363 acres of wheat 2.036,181 of oats 218,503 acres of barley, bere, rye, beans, and peas, 1,104,596 of potatoes, 354,362 of turnips, 99,873 of other green crops, 106,286 of flax, and 1,303,983 acres of ineadow and clover. The cereal crops exhibit a deorease between 1865 and 1856 of 48,517 acres, but on wheat alone there in an increase of 83 58 acres. The green crops exhibit an increase of 114,4Z8 acres, and the total net increase in the extent of land under crops is 64,845 acres. The quantity of live stock in Ireland last year was as follows, viz.:573,266 horses 3,584,723 cattle, 3,688,143 sheep, and 915,933 pigs ihere is an increase under every head except pigs, which have decreased materially. The total value of the live stock in 1856 ia estimated at 33,088,7011., being an increase of 4,553,9021 as compared with 1852, The horses are valued at 81. each, cattle at 61. lOs., sheep at lf. 2s., and pigs at 11. 5s. each. The report on Scottish agricultural statistics, just out, shows that m 1856 the total area of land under crops was 3,545,191 acres, being an increase of about 15,000 acres over the year 1855. 1,4'1,232. acres were under cereal crops (263,328 wheat), 149,351 under potatoes, 460,131 under turnips, and 29,795 acres under other green crops; 2,7231 under flax, and 1,475,775 under gras and hay. The area of Ireland is 20,811,774 statute acres, and that of Scotland nearly the same, or 20,047,462 acres, but the former country has 5.753,6S1 acres under crops, and the latter only 3,545,191 acres. In Scotland the live stock last year consisted of 179,901 horses, 967,311 cattle, 5,822,478 sheep, and 126,944 pigs, there being an increase of horses and sheep and a decrease of cattle and pigs. The entire number of occupants of those farms in Scotland which contained the crops and stock above given was only 42,913, whereas in Ireland the number of occupants and holders from which tbe statistics are collected is upwards of 600,000; and the returns include the crops and stock of every occupier and stockholder in Ireland. The number of Scotch occupants whose acreage and stock were omitted from the last returns is said to have been 42,229 in 1854-hainng then among thems 29,008 horses, 129,469 cattle, 149,4.32 sheep, and 26,399 pigs, It would accordingly appear that the entire number of land and stockholders is 600, 000 in Ireland and 85,148 in Scotland.

DYIG TO GET MABRIED.-A gentleman residing on the banks of the Tyne lately advertised for a wife in one of the Midland papers, and in the course of a week afterwards received tenders from between 50 and 60 fairaspirants to the wedded state. At least half-a-dozen of the letters were ascertained to be from very superior women as regards social position as well as intellectal culture. The great majority were creditable productions, though some, of course, were below par. Further correspondence was entered into with five or six, and the gentleman shortly afterwards set out on a tour of inspection. Having too great latitude of choice, however, he was fastidious in his taste, and his journey seemed likely to end in disappointment had not Providence put another lady in his way, with whom he fell in love, at first sight. Of the rest one was too old, another too young, one was not enough ladylike, another too much of a lady one was a sweet creature, but had no cash; another bad a good income and great expectations, but wanted to kee more servants than ouz prudent friend thought he could afford; and so on, till the catalogue was exhausted. So he proposed to the lady before mentioned, was accepted, and is now a happy Benedict. The fact that a single matrimonial advertisement drew forth from their modest retirement about three score "anxious inquirern" betrays a strange state of things. Why are all those women so anxious to get married ! Some of them because of their isolated and desolate conidition; some to be supportedaby a husband well to do in the world; some to get out of the hands of brothers, sisters, fathers-in-law, mothers-inlaw, &cF or our social relations are so different from these &of the Bechuanas, as described by Dr. Livingstone, that while no damsel of that trib-e has any dread of the reproach of "dying an oldl maid," in England no alternative but to do so is left to many excellent women, Every man may if he will be married; but with the softer sex it is otherwise. They must no,, compromise their delicacy by the slightest mark of interest in any man they know, but must wait patiently to be singled out by the dull, giddy, or scheming, as the case may be. Seldom possessed of independent means, they cannot resort to any lucrative occupation or caling beyond a narrow range. By nature the "'weaker vessels," law and custom mnake them still more dependent on their relatives, and leave them at the maercy of a blind chantce, fromn whicoh they seek to escape, when opportunity offes,~ by respnding to the distant overtures of an entire stranger who, they feel convinced, will not Publish their sham to the w;orld, even should the negotiation lead to nothing since he cannot do so without revealing his own.-Gcalheacd Observer.

Manchester Chamber Of Commerce.
MINC4HESTER CHAMBER OF COrMMRCZ.
The annutl mneeting of the Chabr was held on Mon. day in the Manchegter town-hall. The annual report of the diroctors, which was read referred chiefly to proceedings of the associationL which have already been noticed in detail in The Times.
Mr. T. B3AZLEY, the presiddent, addressd the ChAmber at great length on the subjects that had claimed the consideration of the directors during the past year, which he said were probably of more Importance than those of any previous year's proceedings. Amiong them was that of the state of theo mercsantile laws of this country. It waLs not creditable to us, as a commercial nation, that we had those unfortunate incongruities which existed in our commercial law. (Hear, hear.) England, Scotland, aLnd Ireland were under different systems, and to our utter disgrace a great proportion of the commercial transations in Manchester wcre left in a state of constant illegalty. He did not hesitate to say that 99 per cent, of the transactions on the Manchester Exchange were ilegpl, because verbal contracts wrere not admissible in courts of justice, and because the isame reastonable evidence was not received in those courts in commercial affairs as was deemed sufficient in every other subject of their jurisdiction. If the codification of our iner'4rntile laws could be tffected, that measure would do veary uch for their simplification. (He"r, hear.) Oar bankrptcy laws also really required immediate amendment. (Applause) The waste of funds 'which took place when minsfortune had befallen some deserving individual only increased the disappointment and loss; and in Manchester there was scarcly any hope for the recovery of lost property. for those who sought it seemed almost doomed to lose it all
(Esear, hear.) The Liverpool town dues had also claimed attention. The directors did not approach that subject with anything of jealousy or ill-feeling towards their Livr. pool friends, but they considerod that local taxes levied on the comnmerce of the country should be applied for the benefit of that commnerce. (Hear, hear.) It was a subject of vast inLterest to the community that we were at present sbort of raw materials of every kind; we were short of silk, of fAx;, of ahesps wool, of cotton, of oil, of sugar, of dyeing materials, and, food of every kind All these were needed t provide for the necessities and comforts of the people of this and other countries. Hitherto the manufacturinig and mechanical agencies had kep considerabl in advance of agricultural industry, but hohopea that Machester would proclaim in tones that could not be mnisunderstoodI that we were able and willing to reowive materiala that would employ the industry of the country, and had a-mple means of paying for them. The supply of cotton was altogether inadequate to the wants of our trade. FromTvaious letters and communications in the
pblic pres it woula almost be supposed that there haLd been no effort made by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, or by any other institution, or by private individuals for the purpose of increr-sing the supply of that raw material. It was only an act of justice to remind the public, however, that from its commencement to the present time this Chamber had constantly been directing Its labours towards that object. By those laLbours, the East India Company were ultimately deprived of that monopoly which they formerly possessed of th e trade as well as the goVernment of India, and an immense increae of exports had taken place since freedom of trade with that country was established. He enumerated the various me. morials and representations by which, year after year, since I53, this Chamber had urged on the Govemument in the most forcible maanner the necessity of removing the obstacles to cotton cultivation in India, but all this, had hitherto produced no result. In 1850 Mr. Bright supported their apoli. cation to Government to send out a commission to invests jate those obstacles on the spot ; but his powerful appeal produced not the slightest impression either on the Government or on the House of Commons, laHear, hear.) The Chamber accordingly, with considerable 2ntrepidity, mont out a commaissioner of their own in the person of Mr. MNackay, and the reprts and records which that gentleman had furnished
flyconfirmned the anticipaLtion that India was capable of goigctton in abuadances but for the grievous obstacles eitninthe want of roads or navigation, t-he rudeness of the en of transport, and in various other respects. The attention of the Chamber had also been diroctedseat various times to obstaining cotton from Natal, Australia, Egyt, Liberia, Morocco, Dahomey, atnd other parts of Ag-ca, from Syria anLd the West Indies, slnd all which countries could produce it. One last and final appeal they had made, which they had realy some hope would lead to beneficial results, and that was made to Viscount Canning on his appointment last yea t-o the office of Governor. General of India. (Hear, hear,) Connected with Africa and the East, he thought too much praise could not be given to Mr. Clegg,of Aachester, for hispesvrnei endeavouring to obtain sup plies of cotton frm many dif ferent places. (Applause.) 'Dr. Livingstone had furnished striking confirmiation of th e ca bility of Africa to produce cotton, and probably he mightt~ainduced to come and give the Chamber personally some information aks to the proepects that might be reasonably anticipatedl of tlhe developement of commercial intercourse with that quarter ol the worid. But he wouldi ask at this 3juncture if there hatd not been some apaty on the pr of th tade In this district in connexion wimth the supply of the raw materi.l which was now so much needed. He could mention one little fact which had been under his own notice for the last few years, which he did not th&.c was crelitable to the trade. Some few years ago, 26 bags of excellent Australian cotton were brought to LiverDooL, of which he had himself purchased six, and uased in hInsown manufactory, but the remaining 20, which were not adapted for hisy purPoe he regretted to say, had been allowed to remain m Liverpool, comparatively unnoticed,
upto last Saturday, when he observed they were there still (Hear, hear.) It was true theyv were in the seed, but even If it had costsa fewpounds to somne
ptriotic cotton ispinner to separate the seer from the fibrt ha. would have done good both to himself and the community. It was, at all events, important that India should be forced to keep pace with America is developing herresources, but it seemed that in the pelilod he areferred to America had increased her production 14 times, while Indlia in her supply to this country had only increased nine fold. Hemsubequently referred to theefforts of his colleague, Mx. Finay, anud of Mr. Blundell, to obtain cotton from India. Hfe had seen very beautiful speciLmens of the cotton so obtained in August last, which was worth 15d. per lb. The task was one too gigantic for an individual housezo engar e in but he had a miost satisfactory extract from a letter from Mr. Blundell on this subject, which was as3 follows
"I send euclosod copies of the ofricial letters from Government-
say from Mr. Edmonton and Aft. Bushby-ress,ecting the growth of cotton, which pleace ilay before your Chamber of Commerce. The seed alluded to Iwas part of that from Mr. Baerle, and now that 'Sthe Governor-General in0Council' asks'tobhefavoured with afresh supply of seed,' I think the Manchester Chamrber or Commerce might put themselvys In communIcation direct wish the Secretary to the Government of India, and send them, if they pogaibly can, further supplies, Bet lwouldpaticularly suggest that they do not confine themselves to Soa Island seed, though that from &usrtsalla has promised very favourably; but that they scud the several kinds of Blrzxi seeds-say from Pernambuoo, Babis Sc.; also Reyptian seed, as well as good bowed Georgia andNew Orleaae &.,seed. Te Bourbon aced can probably be got better from here, anud from specimens I have soon grown of it It answers well. It is from the Seycebeles Island. The Manchester Chamber of Connneroo could recommend the Government here to write tothe Mauritius for It. The East India cotton is too ishort and too weak in the staple therefore the produce from Brazh aced meay be expected to answer well, Now that Lord Canning is at the head of affairs hero and we can loek upon him sa one whio appreciates the im-
eaneof trade and commerce, the Manchester Chamber should not loetime in pushing the mnatter of the cultivation of cotton in India. Lor Dahonie aidlitleor o ateniontothese wattem leavIng

In the career of improvement that wvas proceeding in Indi'a a very slight and insignificant imitation of Amenca as being adopted. The railwvays of America far exceeded those even of this country, but inIndia wec had only shadows of them. By the published reporthto the proprietors of the Oude Railway he was glad to see that some of the Indian railways wvere now opened, and from that report he would read an extract wlhich was indicative of better prospects. It was as follows -
"The Bombay line is *t workfor about l0 mles, bnt its course is such as hitherto to afford no fair test of its Prospecta. The Madres line Iseo Open for about 70 miles, bnt it hbs been in work too short a t'me to admit of any opinion being tonned ot Its reults.

Approaching that part of the question of supply from Ameu rica, which was more immediately interestingi he did no think that, taLdig a calm survey of the crop of last year, the defidency would relly exceed 300,000 bags. If we Assumed that one-half that deficiency would fall en this countryp 150,00 bsg, though alarge amount, wa not of such serious isnportanee, when compared with the very extensive consmpnton, as it nWightotherwise have appeared. But he had good reason for beUeving that we should hUve an incteased supply from India next year of not less than 200,000 bags, and therefore a bond fid increase of oursupply of 50,000 bags for the next year. (Hear, hear.) And be believed it was true that the spinning trade held not fewer than 100,000 bags of eotton at the end of lat year in excess of the previous yews stock, and thus we had 150,000 bags of cotton as a resource which did not appear generally and before the public mind, or equivalent to 3,000 bas per week. Therefore we zhould be left at the conclusion of the year in a position that was not exactly one of perfect exhaustion-we might, perhaps, have it the close of the year a passable stock Xo doubt, there would be perplexmg difliculties, and we must submit to high prices, but he thought prices were high enough for the purpose of encouraging cultivation. we hoped, therefore, that the trade would exercise a salutary caution in judging of the actual position in which it was placed. We had not very much to despair of, especial considering that the stocks of cotton in Europe generally wr6e greater at the end of last yerr than they were at the close of the previous tear. It deserved serious attention that the increae m consumption of cotton in Russia, Germany, Holland, and Belgium ras greater than in this country, and therefore we should find thoso countries not only competing with us in the mariets of the raw material, but also in the markets for our own manufactured products. If in the last 14 years we had doubled our consumption, we must not for-
oeb that in that period those countries had nearly qua. drupled theirs. Sometimes our own increase of consumption vas not very discreet. During the last year or two in a town in Lancashire the projections for increased consumPteon of cotton had been so oonsiderable that, even though last year they consumed a much larger quantity of their kind than came into the country, yet their prospective arrangements for increLsng consumption actually amounted to 50 per cent. beyond their present consumption.

Sir,-As my name Was so promin ently brought forward' in The Timcs of Friday hat in the review of a recent work of Colonel Tal och, I trust you will allow me space to explain that the reviewer has been led into an error in stating that I acted in the Quartermaster-General's stead during his illness from the 16th of November to the 18th of December, as I was not in the Crimea at that time.
I never stated that the coatees, at the date of their arrival-viz., the 28th of November-were found too small by reason of the great quantity of under-clotbing then worn by the men, when, Ls Colonel Tulloch says, they had no under-clothiog at alIL
I was sent to Constantinople on the 16th of November to purchase warm clothing. I returned about the middle of December. Some days after this the clothing branch of the Quartermaster. General's Department was placed under my charge.
AIl my statements relative to the subject have reference to a period subsequent to my taking over that duty, when large quantities of clothing had been received and had been distribated. This is stated in my evidence before the beard. I cannot imagine how Colonel Tulloch could have overlooked it.
I may here mention that Sir John Ml'Neill and Colonel Tulloch, in their London report, state that after the middle of January the troops had " more than enough of clothing."
Colonel Talloch would appe ar to be endeavouring to bold me responsible for the non-issue of stores when I was not in the Crimea, or when the necessity for their issue was passed, for, by his own admission, the three weeks that elapsed between my return to the Crimea and the middle of January had been well employed.
With regard to my alleged "self-contradictions," I an perfectly ready to abide by my evidence given to the Board of General Officers, taken as a 'whole, but I cannot be expected to acknowledge partial extracts by a prejudiced person relating to different subjects, though placed in juxtaposition to give an appearance of contradiction.
I must also decline being held responsible for 'what Colonel Tuloch states to have been my evidence before the commissioners in the Crimea on which these alleged " self. contradictions" are founded; that evidence was taken down by Colonel Tulloch from a rambling conversation between the commissioners, Colonel Gordon, and myself. I never had an opportunity afterwards of correcting it, which I have no doubt it much needed, as Colonel Tulloch states that the original notes were "imperfect and almost. illegible from alterations."
I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,

THE OUDE QUESTION.-A copy of a letter addressed
THE OunE QussTIoN.-A copy of a letter addressed by the Directors of the East India Company to the GovernorGeneral of India on the 10th of December, 1856, on the question of Oude was yesterday published. The Directors regard with just complacency the acquieition of a territory of nearly 25,000 square miles, and containing 5,000,000 inhabitants, *- without the expenditure of a drop of blood, and almost without * murmur." The Directors approve the amount fixed for the annual stipend of the ex-King of Oude-viz., 12 lacs of rUpeesm They are unanimously of opinion that it is not advisable to perpetuate or to prolong the tenureof the Royal title, as pastexperienco has abundantly demonstrated the inconvenience of allowing au empty nominal or titular sovereignty to descend from generation to generation in the case of these (as Dr. Doran would caU them) " monarchs retired froma business." Such titles are believed to foster humiliatinu recollections, and to engender delusive hopes. The kingry title will accordmigy die a natural death with the present titular sovereign, Wajid Ali Shah; at all events, no promise haS been made t the contrary. The Royal descendants, however, will enjoy a certain stipend, as the 12.]acs of rapees settled on the ex-King will descend as. an hereditary grant. The young princes are to be trained. and educated so as to become "useful citizens," and it is' suggested that the family may be made " jagheerdars," so
rs h prvent tbem from sinking into degraded habits of life. he payment of the arrears due to the army of Oude iS approved. The conduct of the Governor-General of India and Ssr J. Outram is warmly commended by the directors, and so closes their despatch.

HOUSE OF LORDS, TuESDAY, FEB, 10.
The LOPD CILHACELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock.
IRISH RE1PRESENTATIVE PEERS.
The Earl of LUCAIN gave notice that on Thursday he would ask whether it was the intention of the Government to take any steps, pursuant to the recommendation of the select committeo appointed last year, to institute an inquir7 as to the expenses mcurred by Irish Peers in proving their right to vote for representative peers.
ADMNTISTRATION OF THE COUNTY RATE.
LoTd FEVERSHAM presented a petition from the board of iuardians of the Pocklington Union, in the East Riding of i ork, showing that while the amnount expended for the relief of the poor sice 1833 had decreased, the amount expended under the head of county-rate had considerably increased. The petitioners stated, without wishing to cast any reflection upon the magistracy of the country, they were of opinion that the experience of the representative principle introduced in the administration of the Poor Law fully Justified the confidece wvhich had been placed in the boards of guardians by the Legislature, and they considered that the ratepayers throughout the country were entitled to the same privileges in regard to the money expended in the county-rate, and they prayed, therefore, the fIouse to pass a measure for tho attaimnent of this object.
Petitions were also presented by Earl GREY, the Earl of AIRLIE, and Lord KrsXA IRD, but the purport of them did not reach the gallery.
AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.
Lord WYNFORD asked whether it was the intention of the Government to reintroduce the bill they brought in last year for the collection of agricultural statistics, or any modification of that measure during the present session.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY regretted that the feeling evinced throughout the country in reference to the bill of last year, both during the session and the recess, had been such as to induce him to think that it would be useless to attempt to reintroduce it this session with any chance of success. It was, therefore, not his intention to do so; but, at the same tinie, the Government were alive to the importance of the subject, and wouid lend their assistance to carry any more modified measure.
Lord FEVERSlHAM said, had any other machinery been adopted than that of imposing on the Poor Law guardians the duty of carrying the bill into operation, it would in all probability have met with general acquiescence; but it was that part of the measure that made it so offensive.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY was understood to reply that that machinery was strongly recommended by a Parliamentary committee and adopted on that ground.
Viscount DLINGANNON said he believed that if a bill of a more modified character had been introduced it would br.ve experienced a different reception both in that House and throughout the country, but it was the kind of inspection into every man's private aflairs which it was to originate that was really offensive to the public feeling.
Lord FEVERSHAM said the noble lord (Lord Stanley of Alderley) had refused to adopt any other machinery for giving practical effect to the bill.
THE INCOME-TAX.
Lord BROUGIHAM presented a petition, numerously signed, from Aylesbury, complaining of the uneaual and oppressive character of the Income and Property Tax, and praying that the tax might be forthwith abolished on al incomes under 150. a-year, and reduced to its original amount of 7d. in the 11. He would take this opportunity of expresng his satisfaction tbat the Government had expedited the estimates and the budget for the purpose of having this question disposed of; and he hoped the estimates wvould be so framed as to enable the country to dispense with the whole of the war 9d.
JURISDICTION OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL
COURTS.
The LORD CHANCELLOR.-I have placed on the paper a notice that I should this evening call the attention of your lordships to the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The term "ecclesiastical courts," to thoso who are not familiar with the subject, would lead your lordships to suppose that the matters with which I am going mainly to deal were matters of a spiritual or ecclosiastical nature. Had that been the case I should have felt diffident as to my competency to touch upon this subject, which must naturally be one with which it would be extremely difficult for a layman to deal, and I should have felt myself less fitted than a member of the right rev. bench to discharge this duty. in truth, however, although these courts pass by the name of ecclesiastical courts, ecclesiastical matters-that is to say, matters which aro in their nature purey ecclesiasticalform but a smal portion of the business which they transact. By custom and by law, indeed, such matters have come to be considered ecclesiastical owing to their connexion with these courts, but, in truth, they are mostly of an entirely temporal character. We learn from antiquaries -from those who have looked into our early legal historythat in the remotest ages of our history there was no separa. tion between the temporal and ecclesiastical jurisdiction; that the sheriff or alderman presided in the county coust, assisted by the bishop; and that there aU causes, civil vs well as ecclesiastical, were disposed of by the joint authority of the two, the bishop, it has been observed, having the weight of dignity, while the temporal officer possessed the means of enforcing the deorees. However this may be, from the remotest ages, from a period before what lawyers call the time of legal memory,-that is, the accession of Richard I.,-there was a distinction between courts temporal and ecclesiastical. The courts ecclesiastical then came to dealwith questions having reference to the interests of the Church; but in process o: time it happened-whether by abuse, by accident, or by a mixture of both, I cannot say-that those courts came to have jurisdiction over matters which cannot, except techni-. cally, be described as of an ecclesiastical character; and it is for the remedy of abuses connected with the jurisdiction thus acquired by these courts in matters testamentary and matrimonial that I propose to introduce a measure. With regard to the first of these matters, the jurisdiction o2 ecclesiastical courts may be fairly described as havin1 thus originated :-There has been a doubt among learned persons whether in early times, even as regards personal estate, an individual had at his death the power of disposing of that property by wiUl. At all events, however, he cortainly had the power of disposing of a part of it, and, that being the case, the question naturaUy arose, to whom did the personal estate, not disposed of, go at the deoth of the posessor ? In the earliest times the rule undoubtedly was that it went to the Crown, upon ths supposition that the Crown would dispose of it in pios usus The authority thus vested in the Crown was by degrees dele gated chiefly to the bishops of the different dioceses, or to other ecclesiastical functionaries there; though not rarely iW was placed in the hands of lords of manors and other per. sons of influence and property, with regard to those dying within the range of their authority. The result of this was that the right to this property became vested in a great number of persons, which, of course, would lead to very considerable abuses. The first attempt to remedy these abuses was by a statute passed in the reign of Edward I. (sometimes described as the English Justinian), by which it was enacted that the bishops, who, generally speaking, were the persons to whom these grants had been made, and who had acquired by some means the right originally vested in the Crown, should be bound to discharge out of the personal estate which came into their hands the debts of the deceased. So matters remained until half a century later, in the reign of Edward III., when a further advance was made by enacting that, instead of the property being distributed by the bishop, the bishop should grant " administration " of such property to the nearest relations of the deceased. That led to the appointment of an administrator, who, by the terms of the statute, was to have the same rights and duties as would have devolved upon the bishop. As to the mode in which the administrator was to deal with the surplus, after the debts had been paid, this was a point in dispute for centuries; but by a statute of Charles II called tle Statute of Distributon, it was enacted that any surplus remainino over after the discharge of the debts should be distributea among the next of kin, those next of kin being defined in the statute. That is the state of the law upon this subject to this day. A man may now therefore dispose of all his personal property by will if ho thinks fit; and if he does not dispose o it the bishop grants letters of administration to some near relative, who pays the debts and distributes the surplus among the next of kin. Such is the present ecclesiastical jurisdiction in respect to wills, and I think I need hardly say more to satisfy your lordships that this is a subject of a purely temporal character, justas much as is the
strbution of property under a deed or contract. I should observe that, bsing intrusted with the distribution of the surplus, it naturally followved that the same,persons should have the right of pronouncing upon the genuineness of a will, and these same bishops therefore had the right of requiring that the fact of th"e existence of a will
ue prvecito thm. Tey grnted lettrson
gh ul bo, proved to them. They granted letters of probate; 2n-obatum est, that there is such a
WM. Another Important subject with which ecclesiastical courts deal in this country is the subject of marriage and (in a qualified manner) of divorce. The right of deciding upon the question of marriage or no marriage, or whether there ought or ought not to be a divorce, arose in times anterior to the Reformation from the circumstance that marriage was a sacramen t of the Church, and could only be dealt with therefore by those to whom the ordinances of the Church were familiar-by churchmen, and
not by laymen. This, therefore, was a jurisdiction which existd in ecclesiastical courts, and in ecclesiastical courts only. That is another branch, mmy lords, of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiasical courts with which I shall ask your lordships to deal, and I wi presently state the course which I shall venture to propose. These are the two most important branches of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, but
a third branch sti remains, which is more of an ecelesiastih cal character,...that.is, the correction of clerks for mnisconl.
ductand aattersof that kind, butwith which I shal also ask
orlordahipa to deal as being part of the general subject.
w snow proeed to state to your lordships the course which I propose to adopt -fiirst~ with regard to the testainentary; secondly, with regard to the moatrimonial;- and thirdly, with regard to the ecciesiastiad jurisdiction of these courts. In order to mnake clear the proposals which I shall presently mnake I have shortly explained to your lordships
the mode in which the jurisdiction of these courts or '-
nated, and, as a consequence, the manner in which they lirt obtained jurisdiction, a large number of courts sprang up
B hich had the duty of dealing-with matters.testanentary
sogreat, indeed, was the number that, according to the report of the Ecclesiastical CommiSsioners which was issued about 25 years ago, it. appears that at that time there were no less than from 350 to 400 courts enjoying a testamentary jurs diction, and granting probates, and the inconveniences which might thus arise are not of a merely imaginative, but really of a very practical character. It appears from a retarn which was laid before the other House of Parliament during last session that the number of courts actually granting probate was not then nearly so great, for during the five
ears preceding probate had not been granted by more than
courts, although 15 others were provided with machinery for exercising that (risdiction. Now, my lords, when a person dies within the jurisdiction of one of these court', 2yrisrd facie that court has jurisdiction to grant probate, but many persons have personal property not all within the same district, as is frequently the case with leasehold property, which in contemplation of law is personalty; and the consequence is that most persons have recourse to the Prerogative Court, while, in point of fact, the probate of the Prerogative Court is liable to be set aside if the testator had no property out of the district or diocess in which he died. That, my lords, is a great practical evil, and one which was pointed out 25 years ago, but, although many attempts have been made to remedy it, whether from the conflict of interests or from other causes, aU those attempts have proved abortive. It has, indeed, been said, my lords, that the subject is one of second-rate importance and of first-rate difficalty, butI trustthatwe shaUbe ableduring the present session to give the lie to that view of the. case. It is a point also of great importance that wills should be properly preserved and registered, and nothing can be more unsatisfactory than the arrangement of many of these small courts in that respect, although in the larger districts the registers are perfectly efficient. There is also another great evil connected with these courts. The contentious business which is conducted in them mainly consists in ascertaining whether a testator was competent to make a will at the time of its execution, and then whether it has been executed with all the necessary legal solemnities. Now, in aU cases of inquiry into the competence of a testator to make a will, there is, as may naturally be expected, a very vast amount of conflicting evidence, and the mode of procedure of the ecclesiastical courts is il adapted to deal with cases of that description. The process of these courts is founded on the canon, or civil law, according to which all the evidence is reduced to writing, and tendered in that form; and the advantages which would result from oral eamination are therefore lost. There is another evil connected with thin subject, which, although not of so Practical a character, is nevertheless one writh which I:think your lordships ought to deal. I have stated that these courts, in their origin, had the powver of disposing of the personal property of a man whether he died intestate or not, but no such rght has ever existed with respect to real estate. As regards real estate these courts have never had any power of granting urobate. Two years ago, my lords, I introduced a bill in which, among other thimgs, I proposed that the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts should be extended to real estate. That bill was referred to a select committee, and after a full and careful inquiry my proposal was overruled by a large majoritv. I etat the time that that vote of your lordships' committee had damaged my measure, but I am not now ashamed or afraid to confess that further consideration has satisfied me that there would be great in. convenience in requiring probate in the case of real estate. With regard to personal estate it is necessary, in conse. uence of incidents connected with it, that some person Should as soon as possible after the death of the testator be designated to represent him, but there is no necessity of the kind in tie case of real property, but, on the contrary, to require proae would be to impose a useless and unnecessary burden. There are, however, certainqualifications which Ipropose to introduce, and which I trast your lordships will not hesitate to sanction. One great anomaly which existsunder the present system is that the ecclesiastical courts decide only upon the validity of wills so far as the personal estate is concerned, while the real estate is decided by other tribunals. If a question, therefore, arises whether the testator were of sounc or unsound mind there maybe a different decision with reswet to the personal estate from that which may be given as to the real estate. There is a suit of this description pending before your lordships' bar at the present moment. n the year 1842 a gentleman named Colelough died seised of a large real estate in the county of Wexford, and of personal property to the value of 120,0001. or 130,0001. The will gave all the property to the widow, and she obtained probate in the Prerogative Court of Ireland, and took possession of everything. In 1849, however, the heir-at-law brought an action of ejectment to recover the real estate in Wexford, and the Court decided that the testator was a man of unsound mind, and that the will had been unduly obtained. The consequence is that, although the same piece of paper conveyed both properties to the widow, she has validly obtained possession of a large amount of personal roerty, while the question of the real estate, of some 701. or 8,0001. a-year, yet remains in dispute. Now, that Is an anomaly which, asit appears to ne, your lordships ought to deal with. I propose, therefore, not that it should be necessary in every case of real estate to obtain probate, but that if there be a contest as to the sanity of the testator, and a coreat be entered against granting probate as to the personal estate, then that the heir-at-law as well as the next-of-lin shall be cited, and that that adverse proceeding shall litigate and determine the question both as to the personal and the real estate. I do not attempt to deal with these matters in a manner merely theoretical, but I look at what are the practical evils of which the public justly complain, and to those evils it is the bounden duty of your lordships to apply a remedy Now, without intending any sort of disparagement to those yver able entlemen who from time to time have presided in t e esiastical courts, I think that we should adopt the suggestion of the last commission, that the court of probate oug t to be a Queen's court, and not an ecclesiastical court. I therefore propose to constitute one Queen's Court of probate; but it should be observed that the duties of that court are practically almost entirely of a ministeriil character. The real matter in which the public are interested is that there should exist the means of ascertaining cheaply and without delay who is the representative of the doceased person. All that Is necessary for that urpose is to have a good, clear, cheap, and expeditious system of registration of wills; because that is what it really amounts to, the practical duty of the court being the duty of registration. 8Te question has been raised whether, in transacting the ordinary business of proving a common will, the aid of proctors might not be altogether dispensed with. That is a point on which I am not ashamed to sav that my opinion has from time to time varied; but, on t e whole, I think that the result of the evidence which was taken before the commiion was to show that the business was done better, and it might be cheaper, through the instrumentality of proctors than if no such machinery existed. I do not propose, therefore, at present to abolish the proctors; but if it should be found after experience that they can be dispensed with I should have no objection, when we had felt our way, to get rid of them. In the meantime, however, I propose that they shal be continued, subject to the power of the Lord Chancellor and the judge of the court to add to the number of proctors, or to make new regulations with regard to them. Your lordships will understand that this monopoly only applies to non-contentious business-to the proving of wills according to the ordinary form, or to what I- call the common registration of wills. In these matters and none others I propose that they should have the same exclusive privileges which they have now; their number is very limited, and a man would be immediately struck off the list if any sort of fraud were discovered, So much with regard to wills proved in London. Now, looking at the matter with a theoretical view merely, we might get over some difficulty by saying that aU wills should be proved in London; but Iam satisfied that that would not really tend to the convenience of the public. I therefore propose that there shall be, as at present, a number of district courts where wills may be proved as they now are. For that purpose I propose to retain all the present diocesan registries, and to add a few others, so as to make the number 30 in all throughout the kingdom, because some of the dioceses are so large and straggling that it is inconvenient for persons to have to go so far. I do not mnean, however, to give these district registries a jarisdiction exceptn, icases where the property does not exceed a given amount. Their operation wil be confined, according to the recommendation of the last commissioners, to cases where the personal estate is sworn uder 1,5001. When the Property is of greater value it will be more convenient that the will should be proved in London.I 1propose also, whenever awill shall he proved inadistrict court, to take away the power of questioning its validity, rendering it a valid instrament in all parts of the kingdom. I intend to introduce a similar measue with respect to Ireland, and I hope, in conjunction with the Lord-Advocate, to be able to extend the bame pro-
vision to Scotland also. Of the 30,000 administrations granted in the year, something hke 29,950 are included in the non-contentious jurisdiction of the courts, and under the bill which I propose all non-contested wills may be proved in London if the parties please, budt wils under 1,5001. may hep %roved in the district reg'stries, and whereever proved sha be valid. Hitherto the Bank of Entlnd has represented that it would be put to great difacu if called upon to trasfer stock upon probates comiing from small courts in the country; but I have been in communnicaton iththesolcitr o th Bak,and having apprised him f m inenton o rnde vaid ill one pove in the disric reisrie, h hs itimte toe tatthe Bank is satisfied with that proposal. So much for the non-contentiOus jurisdiction. with regard to the contentious jurisdiction the law at present is that whereve a i
is proved there the question must be contested whether it is a valid will or not. That arrangement is very inconvenient, for causes must often arise where there is neither judge, nor barrister, nor legal assistance at all competent to deal with such difficult and delicate questions What I propose, therefore, is that there shaU b no contentious jurisdiction in the country-where it is all but impossible,-but that it shaU be carried on in the court of probate in London, as other questions are dealt with m the superior courts at Westminster. Very strong objections have been taken to the proceedings in the ecclesiastical courts, mainly arising from the tedious, expensive, and imperfect manner of taking evidence, and the decisions of those Courts have failed to give satisfaction. Under my bil the registrars will be the officers to superItend the granting of probates, and the judge wil be referred to iu cases in whichhis assistance may be required; but, as the questions involved in the trial of disputed wils are mere matters of fact-such as whether the testator was of sound mind or not, or whether he exeouted the will in the presence of two witnesses or not-I propose that in future all such cases shall be dealt with exactly as trials of issues of will or no will are now conducted in the Court of Chancery, and that nothing shall be done by the judge, except sending them to be tried wherever they can most conveniently be so. Some are of opini6n that they ought to be tried by the judge him.- self; but I cannot give my support to that theory. In the first place,. nothin will be saved either in point of time or expense; and, in «e next, the trial of a disputed fact such as the sanit.Tor insanity of the testator, cannot be carie ee i th 6dinryprores o acause. It niuse be proceeded withst adifferwenpt tiiio fromth^tah It in, w tbe ordnar proceig ar gon *nbhthr~h jde
-tinglam, for, example-.to give evidence in London before the court of probate, where.the quct(on could nfot be io wrelr tried a by the judge on ercuit. What I propose, therefore, is that the same courso of procedure should befolloead as in the case of a trial for ejectment. That brings me to a point upon which I have the misfortune to differ from many of your lordships. At present the judge of the Prerogative Court-my very able and learned friend Sir John Dodson-is occupied a certain numbcer of days in the trial of wills; but when all disputed quAestions of fact are sent to be tried by a jury he Wi11A have almost nothing to do With regard to the appointment of a judge I may observe that the number of cases must be so small that it would be altogether unnecessy to nominate for the new co.art of probate an addiionu judge. What I propose is, that one of the existing judges shaU discharge the duties of that court, and in this way asaving wll be effected to the country. My proposal is that one of the Vice-Chancelors shall be appointed to the diseharge of this duty, though I am aware that on this point I have the misfortune to differ from some of your lordships. Ithas been said that the Vice. Chancellors are not proper persons to try questions of this kind, as they are unaccustomed to deal with matters of fact. I beheve there would be no matters of fact for them to try; but if there should, I propose that aU the evidence shaU be t'ivd voce; so that the argument that Vice-Chancellors are not so familiar with the trial of disputed facts as the judges at common law does not apply in this instance. --With regard to the practitioners in the Court, I do not propose that the exclusive privileges of the proctors should be continued. M1y decided opinion is that the advocates In Doctors' Commons, the proctors, and all the practitioners of the common law courts should be at liberty to practie in the new court of probate. Thus far I have spoken of cases amounting to l5., but there may be wiUs of very small amount-say, IOO1 or 2001-in which there is an actual contest, and it would be very hard that they should have to come up to London. We are therefore hound in such instances to find a remedy, and I propose that in cases where the probate is sworn under 200h it shall be within the competenc ^of the County Court to decide the matter. The mode in which these courts are doing their business is such as to entitle them to our confidence, and, as occasions arise, to increase their jurisdiction, and accordingly I think they may be usefuly employed in the discharge of this dutl. This is the whole of the proposal which I have to submit to the House with reference to testamentary jurisdiction. I shall now proceed to the second branch of the subject,which is not less imuorant than the first--I mean the question of matrimonial jrsdiction. Your lordships are aware that some years ago a Royal commission composed of very learned persons was appointed to look into the question of divorce, anda that this commission, having taken evidence on the subject^ came to the conclusion that the present state of the law of England on that subject was highly discreditable. (Heir, hear.) The simple fact is that a divorce a vincu'o matrimonii cannot bo obtained in this country by any legal proceeding known to the constitation. It is true a marriage contracted under certain physical circumstances may be declared a nullity, but that is not a divorce; to caU it so wouldl bean entire misue of the ter.; it was a declaration that there never has been any marriage at all. For a century and a half it has been the practice of your lordships' House if an act of adultery on the part of a wife has been established, and if the act has been foUlowed by a divorce a mine& et thoro obtained in the ecelesiastical court , to grant an act of Parliament-pivilefium-in order to make the husband a single man again, so as to enable him, if he so choose, to marry another woman. In the case of the wife she can only obtain a divorce from her husband if adultery has been committed by him under circumstances which render it impossible for her ever to cohabit with him again, as, for example, when the adultery amonnts to incest; and I believe there are only four instances on record in which your lordships have
ted such a divorce by dissolving the marriage at the sance ofthe wife. Now, the commissioners reported that this was a state of things extremely discreditable to the country, and that a remedy was called for. One of two courses was open,-either that no such bills should pass your lordhips House -an opinion entertained by the chairman of committees; or, as the commissioners suggested that you should institute a tribunal which should take the place of the Legislature, and settle all auestions of divorce. With that object I introduced a bill last session of Parliament, which was passed by your lordships, but which went to the Commons too eto to be considered. After I introduced that bill my noble and learned friend on my left (Lord Lyndhurst) took up the whole subject with his accustomed clearness, and adverted to the great grievance which pressed on married women, even independently of this question of divorce. He pointed out the injustice done to a married woman who might be divorced a mensd et thoro from her husband, so as not to be under the obligation of cohabiting with him again. The law with regard to property acquired by married women under such circumstances is exceedingly anomalous, and with the view of remedying that anomaly the divorce bill of last session was referred to a select committee, and some proposals were made by my noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurstj with the object of mitigating, if not of removing, the existing evils. These proposals were adopted by your lordships, and Ipropose to introduce them, with some alterations, l the bi I am aboat to lay on the table. In the first place I think that if a married woman has been deserted by her husband without- lawfulexese for a certain time-say three years-it is extremely reasonable that she should be entitled to a decree of divorce or separation from the court to be constituted, which wiUl enab e her thenceforth to be misiress of her own property. She may employ her industry either In intellectual or in less elevated
suits, but her husband wiU be precluded, if he shul return, from climing as hisdgrorjerty any money she may have accumulated. It is cut to define what period of deserton should give this right, but I think it is not unreasonable to say three years, and the precise period canbfixed at a subsequent stage of the bill. I thik no husband who leaves his wife without lawfal excuse for a period of three years should retain the right of saying on his return, "I claim possession of aU the property you have acquired since I left you." If, however, the husb7and and wife should desire to live together again, I think every facility should be afforded :aem for doing so, and, in order to encourage such arrangementS, I sroe that a wife who has earned money shall, uLnder suel circmtne,hvteowrf making a settlement ~have the power of
just as she could do before marriage. Your lord8hips are aware that at present a settlement made after marriage IS invalid as against a third person, but I proose so far to alter the law as to render a settlement made by a woman, under such circumstances as I have mentioned equay valid with aantenupiN settlement. I propose, further, that m cases where there is neither cruelty
desertion a siailar arrangement mgy be made. This pro position has startled some persons; but practicallysuch arrangements are now entered into. It is nolegal
competent to married persons to separate by deed, hut the lega consequences of such separations are not exactlydefned and Lord Eldon contended that if a husband or a wife si separated were to institute a suit in the ecclesiastical court for a restitution of conjugal rights the deed would not be a bar to the claim, because neither of the parties was in a situation to contract. At present these separations are effected ina most cumbrous manner. The wife cannot contract, and therefore she gets a trustee to sontract with her husband. I propose to remove these cumbrous anomalies, and to enable persons to do directly what they can nowonly do idirectly, and that the wife shall in such cases have the same power over any property she may acquire as if she were separated by a decree of the ecclesiastical court. There are some details of the bill which it is unnecessary for me to describe, but which your lordships will be enabled to consider when the measure is before you. There is still another subject relating to ecclesiastical jurisdiction with which I propose to deal, and with reference to which I isa troducedja bill last session, which I had not the good fortune to carry. That measure was oVposed not merely by right rev, prelates, but by noble lords for whose opinion I entertain very high respect; and I therefore withdrew it, in te hope that at a future time I might see my way out of the difficulty in which I was placed. Some few weeks ago I communicated with a most rev, friend of mine, who is not now present, who fumished me with the sketch or outmine of a measure which is, I believe, generally approved by right rev, prelates, and, adopting that sketch as the framework of the bill I intend to introduce, I have no doubt that it will meet all practical evils, and not be disapproved by the right rev. bench. That measure relates to offences of the clergy, which may be classed under two heads-moral offences and doctrinal offences. At present the course of proceedmg in such case is artificial acu embrous, and expensive to a degree hardly credible. (Hear.) If a clergyran is charged
with any offence moral or doctrinal he is summoned to answer the accusation, and if he admits his guilt the bishop inflicts punishment. If the accused does not admit his guilt the bishop has to issue a commission to five persons, who are empowered to summon before them witnesses in support of the charge, and the accused clergyman, and to inquire into the facts. The inquiry is attended with enormous expense and with great delay, and the result is reported to the bishop. If further proceedings are taken the same dilatory and expensive course is pursued, and the expense of such procee ngs is so great that no one withouit a well-lined purse can venture to institute them, The remexI rps,incnomtywt h sgeto o yms

tjon of ti o; the. other Housec of Parliament, I cannot' admit there is any such necessary connexionl between them that atny one of them mnay not be passed, even if the others be rejected. (Hear, hear.) The noble and learned lord then laid the bills on the table, with theeopino
thes Clergy Offencees Bill,hexptoof * Lord LYNDE'UEST.-I desire my lords, to say a few words.ppon that very extensive scheme o,f legislation whica has been subfiAted to you by the sioble and learned lord. And! firsf, with respectL to the testamentary jurisdiction, I a'JM very apprehensive that the bill proposed by my noble
I.: ' ' -
fiiend will not generally be considered satisfactory, and I
may state veTry briefly the reasons upon whicli I found thatC opinion.' At the same time, it is unot to be assumed that in stating those reasons I 64ress my own opinions on the subject. I shall reserve the staement of thoss opinions until the biUl rcaches a subsequent stage. In the last session the Attorney-General introduced a bill upon this subject into theotherhouse, and thegreat objection urged against the bill wasthatit was a transfer of the juris. diction of the court of probate to the Court of Chancery. That transfer was objected to by almost every member of the other House whose attention 'was directed to the su]Iect. It was sad that it would be contrary to policy to add to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, and I heard expressions used as strong as this,-No sane man would add to the jurisdiction of that court. In the present bill it is true my noble and learned friend has not in terms traunferred te jurisdiction of the court of probate to the Court of Chancery, but I will satisfy your lordships that he has done so in substance. Whether that be a wise and proper course I will take some subsequent opportunity of considering; I am now only suggesting the difficulties with which my noble and learned friend will have to contend in the progress of the bilL In the first place the judge of the new court is to be an equity judge, one of the vice-chancellors. Further, the orders and regulations with respect to the course of proceeding are to be. framed by that equity judge, not by him indeed alone but by him assisted by another equityjudge, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. Again, in the mode of enforcing the decrees of the Court the practice of the Court of Chancery is to be followed. So far, then, this tribumal is to be an adjanct to the Court of Chancery. And glve me leave to say, with respect to the mode of taking evidence in the Court of Chancery, that I have communicated with many of the practitioners and some of the judgesof that Court, and they concur in the opinion thatitismostunsatisfactory. (Hiear, hear.) But to pro. ceed further, the apeieal from the present Court of Probate is to a most popular tribunal, the Judicial Committee. Every one approves of that tribunaL My noble and learned friend however, proposes to take the appeal from the Judicial Committee and to transfer itto what? Why, to the appellate juarisdiction of the Court of Chancery, and from the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Chanoery to the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords ! Is not this bill
en, a bi to bolish the court of probate, and to make the jurisdiction of that Court an adjunct to the Court of Chancery? One objection which has always been made to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery is that when questions of fact have to be decided the Court does not decide them, but calls in the assistance of other courts. When a case occurs in the city of London or in the county of M1iddlesex upon which a question of fact arises the judee does not sunmon a jury an try that question, but he sonds it to another court; the record is made ,it then goes down to another court, it is afterwards refer backtotheo ri inal court, and ultimately judgment Is pronounced upon it. Iark the inconvenience and inconsistency that arises in these cases. An issue is sent to be tried in Middlesex before my noble and learned friend opposite (Lord Campbell)-a judge profoundly conversant with the common law, having been accustomed to practise in courts of law every day for years. A question ases in the court of equity on my noble and learned friend's decision, and a new trial is moved for Before whom is the motion made for a new trial, calling in question the decision of my noble and learned friend not only upon the questions of evidence, but upon any questions of law which may have arisen in the progress of the case ? Before a judge who has never been in a court of common law in his hfe. Itis an appeal from an enlightened judge who has practised every day in a court of common law to a judge who is-I will not say utterly, but comparativelyignorant of the subject. (Hear, hear.) Are not these adequate objections to the species of tribunal which my noble and learned friend wishes to establish? I am not now urgmg them myself; I am merely stating them as they will heurgedin other places agi'nst my noble and learned friend's bil Again, as the law at present stands, an heirat-law cannot be divested of his property without the verdict of ajury; he has a right to insist upon it. But by this bDil a verdict wil be by no means necessary. The question may be decided by a court without a jury, and not by a court of common law, but by a court of equity. I now ask your lordahips 'whether it is not probable that the bil when it comes to he considered and discussed in another place will not be as satisfactory as my noble and learned friend seems to anticipate. My noble and learned friend may be sanguine as to the successful management of the bill, he may be able to combat many of the observations I have made, some of the arguments against it I might myself be able to refute, but those observations and those arguments are very likely to prevail against the bil. Again, about 40 new district courts are to be established, or old courts ahready in existence are to be continued; I did not quite understand my noble and learned friend's statement on that woint. But what is the duty to be discharged by the registrars of those courts ? They wiUl have no more than a ministerial jurisdiction; they will only have to see that the wllls are properly framed. Why are courts of this kindto be established or continued? You have County Courts all over the country. Why should not this jurisdiction be exercised by the registrars of the County Courts under the superintendence of the judges, and tie expense of these new courts saved to the country? Another very difficult part of the subject is that of compensation. You are transferring the jurisdictior from the court of probate, presided over by a learned judge, expsriencedin the discharge of his duties and ably performing them, to a new tribunal. Why that court is to be abolished for the purpose of creating a new court as an adunact of the Court of Chancery I cannot say, but I should be glad to know what compensation is to be offered to the members of that court. Your lordshipS will surely require some anticipation to be made by mY noble and learned friend as to the probable amount of that compensation, in order that you may consider whether you are not paying too highly for this transfer ofjurisdiction.
said at the outset that I would reserve my opinion upon the details of the bill, and would only state my reasons for thinking that it would not be satisfactory. Those reasons I have now sated, and it is for my noble and learned friend to consider whether he wll be able to overcome the objections to which I have directed his attention. Dismissing that subject, I now come to the billUof my noble and learned friend which relates to church discipline. The subject of that bill is one of great importance, and I must claim the attention of your lordships, particularly of the right rev. bench, to tho few observations I am about to make upon it. Our attention has been very much drawn lately to the statute of the 13th of Elizabeth, under which a prosecution has recently been carried on. By that statute the slightest deviation in doctrine from any of the articles of the Church of England may be made the sabject of a prosecution, although that deviation maybe sanetioned by the highest authorities-by rev. and nght rev. writers. There is no alternative. This is a very harsh state of things, and what is more is that by the ecclesiastical law every offence within the jurisdiction of the act to which I have referred is an offence to be dealt with under the general ecclesiastical law, and if dealt with there the punishment is not defined, but the sentence may adapt itself to the nature of the offence. I think this is a subject of great importance, and one eminently deserving your serious consideration, though I am not sure in adverting to it that I have made myself intelligible to your lordships. (Cheers.) There is, however, a difficulty which has been pointed out to me as standing in the way. The statute to which I have referred it seems, forms part of the Union of Scotland; but I may remid your lordships that in this particular matter now under consideration the Scotch have no interest or concern, and if we are desirous of relaxing or altering the law in this respect surelyno reasonable objection to that course can be made by them. With reference to the third subject to which my noble and learned friend has caled your lordships' attention,-namely, the divorce bilL I shall say but a very few 'words upon that point, and for this obvious reason, that this bil was before your lordahips last sessions, and was discussed as weU by your lordships as by a committee upstairs. I shall not, therefore, go over the merits of the bil again, but there are two alterations in it
one an omission and the other an addition, to which I must briefly allude. The bill of last year contained a clause by which, in the case of a conviction and separation for adultery, the party gnulty of the adultery should not be allowed to mar the accomplice. That clause had not been introduced in the present bill. I regret, too, that my noble and learned friend has not thonght it necessary to incorporate in his bil any provision for putting an end to a practice of which I cannot speak too strongly in terms of condemnation -I mean the action for criminal conversation. (Hear, hear.) I say, my lords, it is scandalous and wholly inconsistent with the manly character of this country for a man to attemnt to satisfy the laws of honour by having recourse to a roceeding of that natureo; and if no other noble lord shoald seek to introduce a clause with the view of abolishing this form of action I shall certainly think it my duty to do so at a subsequent stage of the bil. The only remaining point to which I shall call your lordships' attention is the addition made to this bill by my noble and learned friend on the point of separation. By that addition a husband and wife, without the intervention of any trib;unal, and simply by a deed recorded in some offlce, would be
allowed to separate themselves and afterv-arTd-s live anpa-rt.
believe, my lords, this is the first time that an attempt has been made to deal with the question of separation in this way; and I hope my noble and learned friend wil well con-
sider this clause before it passes into law. It is a subject of the greatest gravity,- affecting most deeply our domestic
interests, and it ought not to become law without the most senous consideration. These are al the observations I feel myself caled on to make on the subject under consideration, and I need scarcely assure your lordships that they are not aade v any spirit of hostility to the various proposals of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, a of
which, on the contrary, are of such importance as 'wel to deserve the close attention of your lordehips. (Cheers.)
The Bishop of EXETER expressed the pleasure with 'which he had hstened to the speech in which the Lord Chancellor had propounded his plans to the House, and would content himself by simply saying further, in reference to the subject of Church discipline, that he hoped his noble and learned friend would be of opinion, on reconsideration, that it would be better made the subject of a substantive bill than form part of any general measure.
LordCAMPBELL-Iamimperatively called on, mylords, in the discharge of my duty, to express a strong opinion in corioboration of 'what has fallen from my noble and learned friend opposite (Lord Lyndhurst) upon one part of the bil of my noble and learned friend on the woolsack. I hear with astonishment and dismay that it is proposed thatany married couple any morning, if they have had a temporary disagreement, or if they have had some impro o long entertained, may go actually andobtapiunaedivorce for all practical purposes, ex
cept marrying pgain. Those of your lordships who mayhavereadabook written by my learned friend, Mr. Mcqueen, will remember that they 'ave in France what iscaUleda*sepratios de cor,ps, the effect of which is that the marriage between the parties affected by it is dissolved for all purposes, exospt that they are denied the privilee of marrying an; but in that case the mattermu be
decded by a judicia ibunal, there must be
adeqnate reasons assignedI for the separation, ani an attep t reconciliation on the p art of the judgo: Common, law couts at present viewed deeds of separation with great suspicion, but such deeds were nothing compared with the judlicial proceedings proposed under 'his bill, which would amount to a virtual divorcii, except that parties would not be allowed to marry apaiu. He, of course,
ofrdnoopstio to the first reading of this bill, and he~ ___pe that it would accompilish the reforms which for 25. long years had been desired in vain. He mnustsav, however, that he had his mnisgivings on the suLbject, aind began to thik that the ecelesiastical courts were immortal, and bore a charmed life. At the same tim-e there was no one better qualfed than was his noble and learned friend on the woolsack to fight with the difficulties which must be encountered, aind he (Lord Campbell) shouldI be happy to give his noble friend any aid in his &wer to surmount those difficulties. With regard to the turt of Chancery he had aL sincere respect for that Court, hut he did not think it was well imaginedl on the part of his noble and learned friend to make& a curt of probate an adunct of that tribunal. He knew that in the other House of Parliament it was considered a dreadful calamnity-a tremendous evil-when any person was forced to go into the Court of Chancery ; and even among their lordshTip, in spite of the opportunity many of them enjoye for seeing the ability with which the equxity judges discharged their duties, it was felt that for some purpomse t'he Court of Chancery could o ey rrl be selected for the performance of certain functions. Now, suppose an issue was directod to be triedias to whether a wrlhadLbeen properly executted, and whether the testator was of sound mind. That question would comeo before one of the judges of the land either in the county of Mfiddiesex or u!pon. circult; it might in due course come before hmm. Now, he should feel it no degradation to have one of his decisions reviewed by an equity judge; but, at the same time,without arrogating any superiority to himself, he doubted very much whether it would not be more satisfactory to the parties if the a peal went before his brethren in the Court of Queen's Benct and the Court of Exchequer Chamber rather than before a single Vice-Chancellor. (Hear, hear.) These were some of the arguments which would be used against the present bill, and he trusted that his noble and learned friend, if it was not too late, would avoid the Court of Chancery, and make his new tribunal a c-ommon law court. Hea,hea. Notwithstanding the difficulties intedou
~ehoped they would be surmounted, is leare
friends and himself would all do their best to assist in this work-, hutt he thought his noble and learned friend was not exactly in the right course at present, and that after consideration he migt avoid some of the objections to which the scheme of which they at present had a sketch seemed open.
Lord BRO'UGHAM also hoped that the difficulties in the wa of this imnportant bill would be overcome by his noble ang leared frend on the woolsackc, but he confessed that his furst difficultyv arose upon this point--- that it was pro. posed to establish a new court under an eulty. jdget exercise a common law jursdition. (Hear hear)lh understood the plan aright, the new court was to be regulated by the procedure of the common law. Now, if a Vice-Chancellor was to sit as a judge in such a court, what occasion was there to deprive the presnt judges in Doctors' Commnons of their jurisdiction ? Why might not Sir J. Dodson discharge precsely the same functions which his noble and. learned friend's mueasure proposed to vest in the Vice-Chancellor? (Hear.) As to common forms, could there be any doubt that such causes would be quite as well -if notbetrd sd of b h rsn ecclesiastical judges than by a Vice-Chanecdlor-and, as to contentious caes, could not these also be heard and decided upon quite as well by the Prerogative Court? Hle confessed that he could not see the nlecessity for abolishing the Prerogative Court in order to establish a new court under a Vice-cucellor, and it seemed to him that such a judge was as little likely to expedite that business-he not being a common law jdge--as the judge of the Prerogative Court himself. TreAi(ed-blu t'lor it seemed, was to direct an issue to be tre;btcould not the judge of the Prerogative Court do the same thing? He was stuite of opinion, as at present advised, that the ecclesiastical courts ougliht to be abolished; but then, he conteiaded, they should constitute a court of p rebate, not under an equity judge, not connected with the Court of Chanceery, but a court of probate consistig of common law judges. He could not h d greein with the right reverend prelate as read teqestion of church discipline, 'that it would be better to treat that as a separate question. There was another point to which he wished to call their lordships' attention. A case had lately occurred which was much to be lamented by all friends of the Established Church, and which mnight perhaps find its way to the Judicial Committee, and that case confirmed him in the belief that it was not right that any individual should be dragged before that tribunal in order that doctrinal points might be tested. Hf such a state of things were tolerated, it threatened, he would not say a disruiption of the Church, but certainy a cositinued state of disturbance. Hle hoped, also, that for his own part he mnight meet with some encouragement to renew a bil which he had proposecl some years back in order to remedy a great gfrsevance. Under the present system if a c or man had from conscientious motives separated himsel from the Church and become a Dissenter-u he knew several personasto have done who were a grea~t loss to the Church, and, at the same time, whose 'secesson was a great loss to themselves-and performed service as a Dissenting minister, he was; by thep resent law liable at any moment to be brought before the diocesan within whose diocess he had discharged those functions, and to be dealt with as if he were stfi a member of the ChuLrch of Eugland. If without in the slightest degree infringin
upon =the rinciple that holy orders are indelible it couli be enace as part of the posed bill that all Church censure should cease as appliedto parsons who had separated from the Church be thought that it would be a wise and cortainy a most tolerant addition. With respect to Church discipline also he hoped that some measur would be taken to relieve right rev, prelates from the position in which they were at present placed as regardled the enforciug of discipline. One right rev, friend of his, the Bishop of Wineh ,hdbgee to. his own knowledge, for he himself had sat in the Judicial Committee on thLe tral of the ape in one case put to an expense of certainly over 4,0001, andahe believed over 5,W01.~, not one farting f wh ch ould he possibly recover, and the inevtabl remt of such a state of things was that right rev. prelateswould not be much enoouragedtoprform their duty. lie was sorry that the bil did o ofrher in granting divorces a vinculo at the suit of the wife, As far as it did go it was in the right direction ; but it did not provide the complete remedy that was required. He quite agreed with his noble and learned friends as to the cruelty inflicted on the wife in cases of adultery on the part of the husband, and he concurred also in their remarks upon the suidt of crirn con. when the woman whose character was at stakce was not permitted to be a party to the suit, and when she might be the victim. of a conspiracy between the husband and tho alleged adulterer. He thought, probably, that something might be done to amendI this state of things by providing that actions of this description should not go on without notice being given to the wife; and he trustedi that all these actions Would finally be got rid of. In conclusion, the noble and -learned lord was understod to say t'hat he would treat seduction as a criminal offence, icatead of making it the subject of a civil action.
Lord WENTSLEYDALE said that it was unnecessary at that stage of the bil to enter into details ; but he was per. fectly aware that there were some clauses which required further consideration. The general provisions of the measure should undoubtedly receive his cordial assent, because he believed that the bill was calculated to effect agreai improvement in the law, It met some of the great difficul ties which existed in the court of probate ; it did away with a multitude of small 'urisdlictions ; it established one court where the originals o llwills might be seen - and it put an end to the old annoyance of bona notasbiiia. hoEm objectionable feature of the existing law were abolished by the bill, and perhaps the chief mierit of the scheme was that no new offices were to be created and that no large compna
tions were to be granted under it, because the gentlome
who now officiatedl in the courts would be employed in the new court, and of course tbeywouldreciveno compensation. In 1830 his friend Sir James Graham prepared a bill upon this subject, in which he (Lord Wensleydale) assisted, whicli abolished a number of inferior tribunals, and bore a gat sumilarity to the measure now proposedl; Sir James Graham was not able at that time to bring forward the bill, but he (1ord Wensleydale) supported it because:it worked upon old foundations and created no new offices. (Hear, bear.)
The Bishop of OXFORD suggested to his noble and learned friend opposite (Lord Brougham) that the bill which he had sketched out at the conclusion of his speech did not relate to the same subject as that which was comprised in the Clergy Discipline Act, and he truste, therefore, that the nioble anai learned lord would not endeavour to incorporate it in any way with that act. The Cleg Discipline Act eniabledathe diocesan to deal with thoseclTer'.syan1 who remained in the Church, and the other bill referred to by the noble and learned lord-which appeared to be a very proper measure, so far as he (the Bishop of Oxford) could judge -would be a toleration act to save those who had left the Church of -England from being visited with penalties, He wished to say afew words on another point. The Lord Chancellor the other day expressed his concurrence in what had fallen from a noble and learned lord o.pposite, and stated his readiness to meet his views bygpoviding assessors to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Cuncil in eases of doctrine. But the noble and learned lord on the woolsack had, misapprehend!d the suggestion which had been made
on the subjuect. That sugge3tion was that the Judicial Committee should decide the purely legal qnestion involved in a case of doctrine without any admixture of the spirituality; but that in order to enable them to do so there should be some machinery instituted by which they might learn from the spirituality what was the decision of the spirituality upon the point of doctrine. The Privy Council was a Court in which the Sovereign dispensed ju;stice to one of her subjects who believed that he nad received wrong from ala inferior but an ecclesiastical court, It would be in vain to attempt to make it an ecclesiastical court. The fact of bishops being 'put upon it, or added to it as assessors, would not make it so. It might, indeed, by such means be made to look like an ecclesiastical court, and its decisions might have the appearance of ecclesiastical decision, and so trouble the consciences of those whom they affected, What the Lord Chancellor proposed would only make mxtters worse. If it were left to the Crown to add a bishop when a cause came to be decided, however justly the right rev. prelate mi,ght be appointed, or however rightly he mieht conduct hinsolf in the causo, it would be impossible for him to avoid the imput%tion of having been selected to give a particular decsion in a particular case. All tne evils of temporary delegates wouid bo revived, and revived in a very mischivous manner, because bringing a reproach upob the highest offices of the
Lord CAMPBELL remarked that the proposal of tho right rev, prelateoto establish a spiritual coni to tor- eanuea coming before the Judicial Committee would only make the decsionsof the Prvy Council more odious and more liely to create disgust and bring about the disruption of tho
The LORD CHANCELLOR mlintained that one or more asseusors, selected from the spirituality, would bs Xmply sufficient to enable the Judicial Committee to decide any queation of doctrino which might come before them,
His nobIe and learned friend asked, why should not Sir J. Dodson be the new judge? His ansvwer was that he wished togetridof the Prerogative Courtaltogether. The only function of an intellectual character which the judge would have to exercise was that of saying whether he thought the verdict given m a particu3ar case was in accordance with the facts; and if he(tbe Lord Chanceller) was asked why he selected one of the Vice-Chancellors rather than a judge of one of the common law courts, his reply was that thie Vicet Chancellor would be always at hand and ready to do the business of the court. But for that reason, no doubt, the duties would be as well discharged by a judge at comron law as by a Vice-Chancellor.
The bills were then read a first time.
DRAWING OF BILLS.
The LORD CHAOCELLOR moved that the second report of the statute law commission be referred to a select committee, in order to consider the propositions in that report for the adoption of means to improve the manner and language of current legislation, The statute commisdoners in theirsecond report came to the conclusion that great. advantage would be derived from having a better super vision of bills while in their progress through Parliament. It was felt to be a great evil that the language of the statute-book waa unnecessarly verbose and perplexed, and that bills were passed without a due consideration of the manner in whic they affected the existing law and the existing law affected them. This evil was very much caused by the alterations made in the progress of bills through Parlia ment, some to concilate op position and others to
u fends. It was proposed that an officer should be appointed with a sufficient staff-the extent of that staff being matter of experiment-whose duty it would be to attend to al bills that were referred to him, to report exactly what was the existing sate of the law on the subject to which it related, and what aLlteration it would effect in the existizng law, to examine RU biUs after the bd passed througi committee, and repo rt to the "Aouse the effect of the alterations Wvch might have been made, so that Parliament might he guided in its decisions as to whether thoso bills should pass or not. The mistakes made in legislation from the want of such supervision were podtively discreditable. In the very last session of Parliament a County Court act was passed in which it was provided that certain judges should receive the salsries placed opposite their names in the schedule; but in the schedale there were tWo
jud1 hopsite whose names no salaries were put at aL\ (A ugh. In the same session an act was passed for improvingthe Scotch bankruptcy law, in which certain proceedings were to be adopted in the form set forth in the schedule; bat there was no schedule in the act. (Hear, hear.) 14 1850 an act was passed which was meant to come into force on a certain day after next Trinity term; but it happened to be Trinity term when it passed, so that the act could not come into operation till the following year, and a bill was necessary to set it right. Besides blunders like these there was a custom of introducing clauses into a biU which had no connexion whatever with its object. The report of the commissioners recommended that bills should be classed so that those which lAid down permanent rules of law should be separated from those of a local or private character- that they, again, should be subdivided into statutes appl'ying to England, Ireland, Scotland, and the colonies, and thus our I lation kept from becoming a confused mass which it was almost impossible to comprehend. (Hear, hear.) He therefore proposed that the recommendation of the commission should be referred to a select committee. A similar proposal, he believed, would be made that evening in the other house, and power would be given to the two committees to communicate with each other. He presumed the wish would be to have the same officers attached to both Houses-an arrangement which would save expense and at the same time promote unity of action. (Hear, hear.)
Lord CAMPBELL gave the proposal his unquaafled approbation. Their bnmglng mode of legislation had
rouhght discredit on legislative assemblies. Questions relahng to the common law which were brought before the Court of Queen's Bench were very soon settled, but those which turned upon the statute law-the settlement of the poor, or the statutes relating to highways and pnsgns-occasioned the court great trouble and inconvernence, in consequence of the deplorable laxity with which the different acts were framed. He anticipated that great advantage would result from the adoption oF his noble and learned friend's proposaL
The motion was agreed to.
TRANSPORTATION.
Lord DUNGANNON said that in consequence of what he saw had occurred in the other House of ParEament he thought it was unnecessary to press the questions of which he had given notice relative to the systems of transporta. tion and of tick-ets of leave. It appeared that the Secretary of State for the Home Department had obtained leave to bring in a bill dealing uth the subject of transportation and it would, bethought be advisable to abstainfrom putting any question to the 6overnnaent with reference to the granting of tickets of leave unil that measure-as, no doubt, would be the case-was laid upon their lordships' table, when the whole question could he fully and properly discussed.
After a few words from the Earl of HARBo,vBy, which were inaudible in the gallery,
Their lordships adjourned at half-past 8 o'clock.

House Of Commons, Tuesday, Feb. 10.
I HOUSE OF COMMONS, TUESDAY, FEB. 10.

THE NAVY ESTIMATES.
Sir C. WOOD brought in the navy estimates, and they were ordered to be printed.
ROYAL MARINE FORCES BILL.
Sir M. BERKELEY brought in the Chatham Lands Bil and the Royal Marine Forces Bill, and they were severally read a first time.
NOTICES OF MOTION.
Captain SCOBELL gave notice that on the 19th inst. he would move for a select committee to inquire into the naval administration.
Sir J. WALMSLEY, on the 24th inst., for a select committee on the inequalities of the electoral systemi.
Mr. WISE, on the 24th inst., for a bill to repeal the act, chargig certain diplomatic salaries and pensions on the Conslidteed Fund.
MIr. J. FERGUSON, to introduce a bil vwith respect to the canonries of Carlisle. (A laugh.)
Mr. MACKINNON, on the 2Gth inst., for a select committee on the land-tax.
LEGAL EDUCATION.
Mr. KEATING asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government in the present session to introduce any measure founded upon the recommendation of the comi
missoiners appointed to consider the subject of legal eduscation ?
Sir G. GREY said, he had had some communication with the Lord Chancellor, but nothing was decided at present.
" KINGSFORD v. MERRY."
Mr. GREGSON asked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether, in consequence of the doubts thrown by the courtsoflawupon the vaidity ofadvances on the hvpothecation of goods or warrants, it was his intention to litroduLce any bill upon the subject during the present session?
Mr. LOWE said, the cae of "1Kingsford and Merry," to which his hon, friend alluded, was undoubtedly one of great imaportance. The decision was this :-A man, named Anderson, obtained fronm Mr. Kingsford goods by false representation. Anderson pledd the goods with Merry, and failed to pay for them; uKngsford brought an wtion against Merry, and recovered the value of the goods. The rule of justice, that where there were two innocent persons, the loss should fall on the one who occasioned the disaster, was apparently violated, because Mr. Kingsford was allowed to recover of the person djpeived the value of the goods lost by his own defait He dil not the least doubt that the case was decided accordmg to lair, but he did not tlhink any one would say it vas decided according to substantial justice. (Hear, hear.) It would not be difficult to introduce bill which, while it put an end to the license of pawvning and selling stolen goods, nLow enjoyed, by mc-us of Market over>, wmould give the fair trader pledging and selling poods mn the exercise of his business more protection thani
nenowv enjoyed, and confirm the title to personal property. But it was tot enough that the Government should knowr a hard case had beenl decided. They must also be satisfied that theic interference would be Satisfactory to the mercan.
ilO classes 'who were affected, and on that point he wa3 so2ry to say they were not satisfied. It was quite true a great meetinghad beenheia in thecity ofLondon. It wasalso trDe that a most influential deputation waited upon.Lord Stanley of Alderley and himself at the Board of Trade. nut the chairman of the meeting in the city was opposed to the objects for which it was convened, and there were gest'ksnen of great influence in the mercantile world ,who entertained views in opposition to those of the eeputation. All the answer, therefore, he could give was that the Govermuent would be quite ready to bring in a bill as icon as they were satisfied it would meet the vishes of the mercantile classes, whose interests the bill would materially affect. (Hear, hear.)
LIGHTHOUSE IN THE CHINA SEA.
bMajor SIBTEIORP asked the Vice-President of the Boasd of Trade whether any steps were being taken by the Govemrnment towards the diminution of risk to shipping, by the erection of a lighthouse on the reef known as the Protas Shoals, in the China Sea?
Mr. LOWE said, steps had been taken, but he could not anmoeunce any decisivo result. The erection of the lighthouse would be very expensive. and the only funds at the disposal of the Board of Trade would be passing tolls levied on English ships, which would, of course, act as a differential duty against English shipping.
DESTITUTE SOLDIERS' WIVES.
Sir J. TYRELL said, it was stated that there were 250 soldiers' wives and 350 children in a condition of starvation in the town and near the huts at Colchester, and that the army chaplains had made representations upon the subject to the Home-office. He wished to ask the Under-Secretary for War whether the Government were prepared, for the sake of humanity, to do something to relieve these unfortu. niate creatures ? (Hear, hear.)
Mr. F. PEEL said that no complaints had reached him on the subject, but that he 'would make inquiry at the IHorse Guards,
Sir J. TYRELL had received the statement from one of the army chaplains.
OUR RELATIONS WITH NAPLES.
Mr. B. COCFRANE wished to ask 'when the papers re.*itive to Naples would be laid upon the table?
Lord -PALMERSTON.-They are in preparation, and will be laid upon the table of the house in a few days.
SIR J. M"'NEILL AND COLON\EL TULLOCH.
Mlr. J. EWART vished to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether it was the intention of the Government to make any recognition of the services of Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel Tuloch in the Crimea? (Cheers.)
Lord PALMERSTON.-Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch were employod in the Crimea on an inquiry of a very important nature, bearing upon the state and condition of the army, and they performed their duty entirdy to the satisfaction of Her Majesty's Government (cheers), andvery much to their own credit (general cheering)-with great ability, great perseverance, and great minuteness of research; and no doubt the report that they made was very useful to Her Mfajesty's Government in preventing a recurrence of such unfortunate events as had caused their being sent out. (Cheers.) But at the sarme time it does not appear to Her 3Iajesty's Government that their services were of such a reculiar nature as to require any extraordinary recognition.
It may be and must be a question whether that usual ac- i knowledgment whiclh is made for special services shaU not l.e made to them, and it 'wiU be our duty to consult with them on the subject. Bat, the question of my hon. friend relating to the honours of the Crown, the service does not rppear to us to be one of a nature requiring the Crown to s,tep out of the ordinary course to acknowledge it. (Murmurs, and a few cries of " Hear, hear.")
Mr. LAYARD.-1 wish to know whether it is true that advancement in the army was offered to Colonel Talloch before he went out, and that since then many of his juniors bave been promoted over his head ?
Lord PALMERSTON.-I am not aware of any offer of the kind having been made to Colonel TuUoch. He was a colonel in the army. There are between him and the top of the list several officers who distinguished themselves by
rtual service in the field, and it would not be fair to pro mote him overtheir heads. (Hear, hear.)
CORRUPT PRACTICES AT ELECTIONS.
Mr. H. BERKELEY would be glad to know when the noble lord at the head of the Government intended to move I or a select committee to inquire into the operation of the Corrupt Practices at Elections Prevention Act?
Lord PALMERSTON.-MIy hon. friend may set his mind at ease. We shall take a very early opportunity of moving for the appointment of a committee.
NAVY ESTIMATES.
Sir C. WOOD said that the navy estimates would be delivered to-morrow evening, and he proposed to proceed with them on Alonday next. (lear, hear.)
JOLYT-STOCK BANKS.
Mr. J. L. RICARDO said that, the Chancellor of the Exchequer having withdrawn from the committee of inquiry into the Bank charter so much of the proposed investigation as related to joint-stock banks, he wished to ks.w whether he intended to appoint another committee to eonsider that subject, or whether he had any measure in contemplation?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I have no present intention of proposing a second committee, but I propose to state at an early day the course which the Government propose to take in dealing with that subject.
" THE SECRET TREATY."
Mr. D1SRAELI.-Sir, I have to request the indulgent permission of the House for the course I am taking-the indulgent permission-
Mr. T. S. DUNCOMmSE.-I beg pardon for interrupting the right hon. gentleman; but from Nvhat feU froni hin yesterday, when he said he was going to bring something of great importance before the House, I presume that he is not to-day about to erter into a personal explanation of what he s:rid on Tuesday last and the contradiction which wvhic l was given to it by the noble lord at the head of the Govermacnt. 2Sow, in asking the indulgence of the House for a state:z,ent of a general character he proposes to go beyoni the rules of the House, to which I am myself far from objecting, only Ivish that we should comue to an understanding on the subject. I am, of course, ignorant whether he is about to state that he was imposed upon at Paris or whether the snoble lord is wrong; but, if he is going into this question, I hope the understanding will be that any other,member of thu House is at liberty to make any remark; on what may fall fro:n the right hon. gentleman without being stopped on the question of form, and told that there is no question bofore the House. (Hear, hear.)
Sir J. PAKIN-GTON.-Sir, I rise upon the point of form. 1 think the louse will feel that ray righthon. friend was about to take a coarse which, although not within our rules, is yet always para,itted in cases of personal state. ments. When my right hon. friend has made that statesnent, and the noble lord has made any reply that he may -wish to make, then the usual practice is-and I trust it may be observed on this occasion-for the sense of the House to decide whether the discussion shall be prolonged. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. D'ISRAELI.-Sir, when the accuracy of a statement made by a mnemnber in his place, and especially a statement of such moment, has been impugned, and impugned without provocation, it has been the custom of this House to permlit that member to take an opportunity to recur to the subject, and to make such a statement as may vindicate his accuracy and perhaps his honour. (Hear, hear.) Sir, it is in that spirit that I appeal to the House, but if any hon. member cals me to order I shall understand that that permission will not be accorded. But if the permission be accorded I trust that it u-ill be fully and liberally accorded tome. (Hear.) I assure the House that I shaU not think it necessary to do more than clear up the point in dispute, and I hops I am] fairly interpreting the general opinion of the Hous, when I state that such a course is usualy adopted under similar circumstances. I feel, too, that in appearing in my place to answer the contradiction of the noble lord I am doing that wvhich is neither unreasonable nor unnecessary. (Cheers.) I will therefore assume that the House is willing to grant me the indu lgence which on many similar occasions it has granted to members on both sides of the House. I remember that some years ago-it may be about eightthere was a discussion in this house on the proceedings which had taken place at Cracow. The debate was one of
corselderable importance, and it was adjourned for mor than one day. I took a part in that debate with the view vof vindicating the conduct of Austria in that particular, and I rememberthat,thetreatyof Vienna being frequentlyappealed to, I had occasiontorefer toaguaranteecontained, asalUeged, in the treaty of Vienna, and given by England to Prussia:e guarantee of her Saxon provinces. The noble lord now at the head of the Government was then Secretary of State for Foreigu Affairs, and had been Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for no less a space than 17 years. On that occasion, 'when I referred to the guarantee of Great Britain to Prussia of her Saxon provinces, the noble lord gave an unequivocal contradiction to me in the face of the House. He said that there was no guarantee in the treaty of Vienna of the Saxonaprovinces of Prussia by England. Nay, more, the noble lord said that in the treaty of Vienna there was no guarantee whatever. On that occasion I had the opportanity of reiterating my statement, and of mentioning the clause ofthoe treaty in which the guarantee was contained. The noblq-xd was still incredulous, and instructed one of his aides-de-camp to go up to the library-it was in the old house-and bring dow'n the treaty of Vienna. The noble lord referred to the treaty of Vienna in this house. He found the guarantee given by Great Britan to Prussia of her Saxon provinces. Thus did the noble lord, who had been Secretary of State for 17 years, and whose reputation as a statesman depends mainly on his knowledge of foreign affairs, become ac. quainted for the first time, apparently, with one of the mc st important eng2gements ever entered into by the Bri. tish Crown. On the first night of this session I had occasion to refer in debate to anotherguarantee. I mentioned
returned to that House and passed in such a state that, as was the case the ;Fear before lat with regard to a bill touching the collection of rates in the metropolis, it was necessary in the next ession of Parliament to bring in another bill to amend and alter it. A great advantage would thorefore arise from the appointment of a proper officer, who should be the servant of the two Houses of Parliament in regard to these matters, to whom all bills should be referred, and who should report upon their phraseology and entire effect. There was great room for improvemnent in the phraseology of our statutes. (Hear.) They contained a great deal of unnecessa-y repetition and

Mr. NAPIER aid that the course proposed by the noble lordl would only deal with a small fragment of a very large question, to 'which he (HEr. Napier) iotended to call the attention of the House on Thursday evening. The state of ou.r laws and legislation was a disgrace to a civilhzed country (hear, hear, and he though t that it was time that the House sheuld exert itself to provide for these evils a true and Aden t and not merely a hoipoeopathic, renedy.

Mr. J. eWART had no opposition to offer to the proposition which had been made by the noble lord, but ho thought thea it would have been more proper for a commission tosit upon the proceedingI of a committee of that House than that the report of a commission should be submitte. to such a committee. Nothing could be worse than owas the whole phraseology of our acts of Parlianent, and the country would owe the noble lord a debt of graitude ifhe could devise some plan to amend it. His (Mr. Ewart's) opinion 'wsc that we should never have a comprehensive and prac. ti scheme until 'we adopted the plan of his hon. and learned friend opposite (Mr. Natier) for te appointment of a hMiister of Justice, to 'whic , in its reintroduction on Thurgday evening, he should give his hearty support.
Mr. J. G. PHILLDIORE 'was not very sanguine as to the result of the deliberations of this committee. The notice of the hon. and learned gentleaan opposite (Mxr Napier) was a very com rehensive one, and he thought that it would have been Pbe'tte r to p>51ostpne the appointment of this committuee until the 'w subject had been discuswd upon that notice. The project'of the noble lord was by 'no means a new one. It 'was brought forward in the reigns of Queen Elzabeth and of King Jame, duria the Commonwealth, and in the reign of Charles s . ad
George Mdo. In our own time 'we had had several commisions-pone in 16, 'with no result; one in 1816, with no reslti; one in 13, which sat for 12 yea, cost the country .37,0001., and had no result; and one in 1845, which had cost the country 12,5moi., hut had resuted in nothing else. The country had paid to Mr. Bellenden Ker 10,0001., besides 1,000e which be Isad received for services in connexion with the committee of 1853. He (Mr. Phillimore) did not think it likely that a committee o that House would succeed in accomplishing an object 'which had baffled such repeated
oeffrts, and on which such large sums had been ztm v Thespeech of the Lrd Chancelor on the bi eclte consolidation of the law was calculated to od the most prounds l aslapintment. Never had e he auMonste udclvroaua speeh more inadequate to the occasion. Specimes of conolrdation acts had been laid upon the table, and the most cuery examination showed them to have been drawn up. in na very careless and slovenly ranner. The act consolidating the la'w of treason reproduced the most obso. lete provisions, miaing it treason to kill a judge sitting in Eyre. Enactments relating to the corruption of bleood were also refenred to as now existing, althoug they were abolished many years ago. Anqothert of the 4ills declared the stealing of Exchequer talies, which 'were no longer used, punishable as lareny. Nothing could exceed the tautology and confusion in the language of our statutes. The acts drawn by Mr. Deacon Hume for the regulation of the Customs 'were, however, perfect models of brevity and precision, and it 'was disgraceful thsat their style was not generally imitated in the restof our legislation. Inilustration of theheterogeneous contents of particular acts disfiguring our statute-book the hon. andl learaed entleman quoted the title of the 40th of George HI., which was intended to continue several laws for the northern borders of England, to confer certain privieges connected with the conveyance of sugar from our colonies, to deal with the prosecution of offenders, and also to prevent the retaffing of wine within the universities. Another statute, comprisig a sti larger and more motley
r ou of subjects,o was entitled "oAn Act to continue weiL
he river Thames, to prevent tho spread of distenpers among horpned cttle, to make certain -regulations for attorneys and solicitors, to provide for a more frequent return to writs in the county palatine, to impose rates on the inhabitants of the city of London, and to allow Quakers to make affirmations in lieu of taking oaths."
om. BAThES did not rise to criticize the acts of George III., nor even to discuss the merits of the Statute Law Commision, ofor 'which there'would be ample opportunities bher r. He merely wished to point out that the eminent names appended to the suggestion which formed the subject of the present miotion, including as they did the Lord Chancell of rdsLyndhurst, Brougham, Campbell, and Wensleydale, ought to carry great 'weight with the House, and should induce it, at least, to tanction the appointment of the commbittee. The committee would not revise what the commissioners had done, and go over the same ground againi, hut 'would advise the House as to the best mneans of carrying out an object which had been recommended by the commission. The commissioners thought that athoard, or a single officer 'with a competent staff of assistants, should be at ointed, their preference being in favour of the latter ternative of the two; but this suggestion the prposed commiittee 'would havel carefully to examine, together 'with the further question 'whether the same officer should act for both Houses of Parliament, and should be nominated by each House separately on its own behalf. It was for the House, therefure, now to decide whether or not this recommendation deserved, on the face of it, to receive further investigation before a committee.
The motion was then agreed to.
APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF CONSTABLES.
Sir G. GREY, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to facilitate the appointment of chief constables for adjoining counties, and to confirm the appointments of chief constables in certain cases explained that the measure was intended to remove douWts created by the defective language of the first act sanctioning the appointment of the coiuty constabulary, and to mak e it competent for the justices of any county to elect as chief constable any person holding the same office in an adjoining county, provided the magistrates of the adjoining county gave their consent in quarter sessions to such a joint arrangement. Another part of the bill related to a provision ef the existing law which rendered the election of chief constables subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, and also declared that the persons chosen must not exceed the age of 45. A case had lately occurred in Staffordshire in reference to which the opinion of the law officers of the Crown had been taken, and they were of opinion that, under the terms of the act of Parliament, the magistrate had no option but to elect a person qualified according to the rules prescribed, and that the Secretary of State could not by his consent render valid an election at variance with those rules. Under tihese circumstances, as doubts might arise as to acts done by chief constables who had been thus elected and approved by the Secretary of State, it had been thought desirable to bring in a bill to render valid all acts done by them in the discharge of their duties.
Mr. SPOONER inquired whether the bill referred to appointments very recently made?
Sir S. NORTHCOTE asked whether in future candidates above the prescribed moxinum age could be elected !
Sir G. GREY explained that up to the present time it had been assumed that the approval of the Secretary of State would cure any defect in the appointment. There had only been four sue cases in which approval had been accorded by three different Secretaries of State. As, however, it appeared that, according to the construction of the act, the rules must be strictly adhered to, he had thought it necessary to alter those rules, to render them less stringent, and to provide for the exercise of discretion in special cases by the Secretary of State.
Leave was given for the introduction of the bilL

DECORATIONS OF HONOUR.
Mr. SCOTT isoved for tabular returns of the names of all officers in the army and navy who had been decoratedW with tho Order of the Bath since the lt day of January 1854, with the degree and date of such decoration; t8h 40t of entrance Into Her Majesty's service, and promotiornotheir different ranks therein; giving also the staff orother appointments or commands, with the emolusMonts *ttaohed, eld by them respectively, and stating the
nggsgeen ts in which they had taken part; and of the civilians who, during the same hePriod had been honoured withs the like decoration, and th date. The hon. member repudiated atly intention of casting blame upon any one by assing for the returns, which lie believed, if granted, would
shovr the impartiality and justie with which those rewards hid been onferred, and wfould remove all soreness from the
minds of those who had been omitted from i the list.
Lord PALM ERSTON said the hon, menLber had nob
that there was in existence a guarantee by Friance to Austria of her Italian provinces. I mentioned also that that guarantee was expressed in a treaty, and that that treaty was a secret one. Then, as on the former occasion with regard to the Prussian guarantee, the noble lord contradicted me, but I was in a very different position from that in which I found mnyself eight years ago. Tho treaty to which I referred on Tuesday night was not printed, it was not published, and it could not be brought down from the library of the House nf Commons to vindicate my assertion and to refate the contra diction of the noble lord. Under these circuamstances I did not consider it respectful to the Rouse to rise and make a barren reiteration of my statement, and I felt that such a reiteration would be satisfactory neither to the House nor to myself. I had a moral conviction when I made that statement in debate that it was correct, and that moral conviction sustained me under the unprecedented contradiction which I had received from the lips of the noble lord. The information which I presumed to communicate to the House that night for its guidance I had received from a quarter which I felt confident could not be mistaken, and which I was assured would not deceive me. Although, in such circumstances, I think il quite unnecessary that a member should be caUed upon for his authority, yet, in consequence of the peculiar observations of the noble lord, the House will perhape allow me to say that I received that information from no Feench authority or quarter, and that even if Ihad not made that visit to Paris to which the noble lord referred the other evening with such good taste (Opposition cheers) that information would equaUy have been in my possession. (Hear, hear.) I do not think I amn misstating the feeling of the House when I say that they will agree with me that, assuming the information which I communicated to them to be correct, or assuming-which is the same thing, so far as my credit is concerned-that I had it from a quarter which warranted me in believing it to be correct, it was of the utmost importance nnder the circumstances that I should not be silent upon the point. (Hear, hear) If the affairs of Italy were to be discussed in this house, as they had been at the termination of the last session-if, for instance, the noble lord the member for the city of London renewed the debate which he originated last session-and everybody expected that this was a subject on which the noble lord would have something to say-it would have been impossible for me to remain silent. (Hear.) As an honest man, with that information in my possession which 1 believed to be authentic, it was totally out of the question that I could have listened without a word to a motion brought forward by a statesman of the reputation of the noble lord the mnember for the city, or by any other member-a motion founded upon the proceedings of the Conferences at Paris, and upon the direct or implied engage. ments of the British Government there, or have acquiesced in the suppression of a fact which would have altered all the reasonings, arguments, and feelings of the House. (Hear, hear.) felt from the first moment that I became, or believed that I had become, possessed of this information that if the affairs of ItalY were again brought under the consideration of this House it wouad become an acb of peremptory and inexorable duty on my part to impart it to the House. (Cheers.) The statement I made was a well considered one. I will not attempt to excuse it as made without reflection in the heat of debate; it was well and long considered, and if it be an erroneous oneI am prepared to take all the responsibility of so grave an error. (Cheers.) There is one point upon which r must ask the permission of the House to make one or two observations in order to prevent any miisconception. I wish to guard myself from any misapprehension of the view which I take of such an alleged connexion between France and Austria as a matter of policy. In the remarks which I made on Tuesday it was not my intention to offerany expression of opinion upon this question. Imentioned the existence of thistreaty, not in vindicationnor in reprobation of Austria, but simplyto illustrate the conduct of the Government with respect to the general management of foreign affairs. Iam not bold enough to suppose that there is any person who remembers with accuracy the views which I have expressed in this house with regard to the position which I think Austria ought to hold in the system of Europe, but I may be permitted to say, to prevent any mis. conception, that the last words which I uttered before the
prorogation last year were to express an opinion, in the I course of the discussion on the motion of the noble lord the member for the city of London, which I have long strenuously and stedfastly held, that it is of the highest European importance to maintain the power and authority of Austria. (Hear.) I haveexprmssed that opinion at differenttimesinthis house, and even mn the debate to which I felt it necessary to recall the recollection of the noble lord at the commence. ment of my observations this evening. But many gentlemen who may agree with me in thinking the maintenance of the power and authority of Austria of importance in a European sense will not, perhaps, be entirely of accord with me as regards its importance to Italy and the Italians. In my opinion-and it is an opinion I have often expressed-it ?s for the sake of the Italians highly important that Austria should be powerful and strong. (Hear, hear.) Itis when her authority is questioned, when it is harassed by secret societies and by the machinations of foreign Governments, that the policy of Austria becomes repressive and retrograde. It was not, therefore, to impugn the policy which
ictated the treaty which I alleged to exist, that my observations were directed on Tuesday last, and I will say also, as regards France, because I am anxious that there should be no misconception on this point, that I believe that policy to bave been conceived in the wise, temporate, and conservative spirit which has gained for the Government of the Emperor of the French the respect cnd confidence of Europe. (Cries of " Question !" from the Ministerial benches.) I can assure hon. gentlemen that I am speaking strictly to the question. (Counter cheers ) If the House does not wish mc to speak I wil sit down. I am prepared to make a statement which I believe it is for the public interest that I should make. I began by saying that, in order to make it, it woulld be necessary for me to appeal to their indulgence; and I will not make it unless I can put it before them in a perfect form. ({ear, hear.) It is a statement, I can assure the House, which demands and deserves their attention. (Hear, hear.) It is impossible for me to proceed properly with my statement unless I am enabled to lay clearly before the EHouse my view of the case, to which I am about to call attention. (Hear, ear.) I shall not very much trespass on the indulgence of the House, for I aim coming to details, which every gentleman will feel must command attention. I am merely making these observations to guard m.yself from it being supposed that in respect to the remarks l made the other evening I intended to impugn the policy which would have maintained the authority of Austria, or to have it thought that France was animated in the proceeding, if it had taken
ace, by any other motives than a regard for the interest of urope. Whiat I did complain of that night, and wbat I do complain of now-and it is most germane to the question before us-is that if it be a fact that this treaty exists, if the statement I made was a correct state. nient, then the conduct of Her Majesty's Ministers at the same time was conveying to this House, to the country, and to Europe, the impression that they were pursuing a policy quite contrary, and that the course of their general policy was one entirely adverse to that ivhich this alleged treatyvwas intended to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) That I think is speaking to thee question, and it concerns the honour of the House that on this subject there should be a clear understanding. (Hear, hear ) If it be true that while this allegedI treaty -was in existence wve were negotiating tieaties with Sardinia, and making representations of a contrary character-that is a question which ought to be elucidated to the House. These are circunstances which demand our attention, andare entirely involved in the statement I made, and in the contradiction I received from the noble lord. What I complained of was that Italian policy was made a stalkinghorse by Her Majesty's Government. If the statement I made was a correct statement, I wanted that the liberal party, who extenuate their lack of zeal in lomestic affairs by their unlisnited confidence in the foreign policy of the noble lord at the head of the Government, should, not being yet sufficiently warned by the cases of Poland and Hungary, clearly understand that that Italy wvhich they believed about to be regenerated, accordting to their ideas, by the noble lord, was the subjete of very different olicy and very different treatment. (Hear, hear.) N."" X want to place before the House, without exaggeration and exactly, the charbes involved in the contradiction I received fromi the noble ord. I regret his absence at this nioment, but the House would not like me to pause ; and I am sure that his colleagues will faithfully communicate my statement tn him. (At this moment Lord Pabmerstonx, who bad temorarily quitted the house, returned and resumed
his seat. Tle contradiction which I received the other night from the noble lord involved two allegations. The first allegation of the noble lord was this,-that my statement that there was a treaty, anda secret treaty, in existence, by which Fiance guaranteed to Austria the secuirity of her Italian dominions, was altogether a fiction ; that there was no such treaty in existence; that there was not the slightest foundation for the statement, and that, to use the noble lord's words, " it was a romance." (" Hear," and laughter.) That wvas the first allegation involved in the contradfiction I received froim the noble lord. These cond alleration involved in that contradiction wasa derisive hypothesis. The noble lord said, " If there be such a treaty" (though the
noose lord before stated there was none), " and if the right
on. gentleican has seen it, all I can say is that I have not seen it nor heard of it. The Government have heard nothing of it, and, instead of advising it, if we had knowvn anything about it, our advice would havebeen against making any arrangemeents of the kind." Those are the two alegations-I think I have fairly stated them-involved in the contradiction given by the noble lord; and the rest of the noble lord's speech need not at this moment be touched upon. As everything depends upon accuracy, I will read the observations of the noble lordin which these allegations are contained. I take them from an authority the accuracy of which the noble lord will not dispute:-
" We come now to Italy, and, in reference to that question, the right hon. gentleman has had access to archives abd as found out treaties of which we never heard. (A laugh.) He announces that there is a secret treaty concludedt between the French and Austrian Governments, with the sanction of the Government of England, guaranteeing to Austria her Italian posessions. I am bound to say that this is the first time I, ever heard of it. (Cheers.) The rg ht bon. gentleman may have seen such a treaty: hut all I will undertake to say is that we are totally ignorant of it; and, so far from having advised such a treaty, if we had been consulted we should certainly have given our advice in an opposite direction. iHear, hear.) That treay is an entire romnance. (A laugh.)' I )Tatet
Now, have I or have I not accurately described the allegations that are contained in the contradiction whichL I received fromi the noble lord ? (Hear, hear.) I will now address myself to the first allegationlth the whole thing is a romance; that there is no such treaty; that it is pure invention; and that I either ad been hoaxed or myself created the liction in the heat of debate. Now, let mne come to -what my statement is, aLnd I wish the House to do mea the honour of attending at this momnent to what I amn about to state. My statemaent is, that engagements were negotiated between Franc-e and Autstria with the object-the main object of guaranteeing on the part of France the
security of tho Italian dominions of Au tri - fhat there negotiations were carried to a successful conclusion, that they were expressed in writing; that that forni of irntten' instrument assumed the shape of a treaty, and of a secret treaty iand that that treaty was executed on the 22d of Decemoer, 1854. (EHear, hear.) In answer to the first allegation the noble lord said, that there was no treaty whatever, and that it was a romance. I am here to re-state that 'which I uttered the other night, to give tho very date of the instrr ent, the form, purport, and object of the instramer,.. (Hear, hear.) I now come to the second allegation contained in the contradiction which I received from the noble lord-an allegation which the House would perfectly remember was uttered in a spirit of derision. I will, however, give the dvantage to the noble lord of taking it gravely. (Hear, hear.) The second allegation contained in the noble lordbs denial was, that "if such treaty had been spen by the right hon. gentleman, I have not seen it and the Government have not heard of it, and, instead of advising it, the Government would have recommended, had they known of it, that it should not be concluded." Now, I have in my possession evidenoe, irresistible evidence, which proves to me that throughout the whole of the negotiations of this treaty which I declare to have been executed on the 22d of December, 1854, by which thesecurity of the Italian dominiona ofAustria is aranteed by France-I repeat that throughout the whole of the negotiations to obtain this secret treaty Her Majesty's Govern ment were privy to them from the first (hear, hear}-that the negotiations received their concurrence-I wil say thm2e cordial concurrence; and that they finally advised the execution of the treaty. The House will at least agree in tlhnking that, as far as I am concerned, I have not avoided the issue. (Hear, hear.) I have, as fairly as I could, placed before the House the very pith and marrow of the contradiction I received from the noble lord, and his two allegagations I have fairly met. (Hear, hear.) But I have some fusther statement to make on this subject. I state to the House nvow that that treaty wasnotonly executed on the 22d of December, 1854, with the cognizance of Her Majesty's GoVerDmeut, but that it was lairgely and extensively acted on; that ia consequence of that socret treaty Austria withdrew a large portion of her troops from Italy, wad the Italian Governments throug>hout the Peninsula became alarmed; and that Austria obtained from the French Government permission to communicate confidentiaUl to the Italian Governments in order to "tranquilize" them-and that, I believe, was the very word used on the occasion-the nature of the engagement entered into between the two countries. Now, I would make upon that point a further statementnamely, that the fact of A.ustria havinq obtained that permission, and of her having commumncated that secret treaty to the Italian Governments, was known to Her Majesty's 3overnment. The noble lord has said that I have had access to archives and have found treaties of which he never heard. I will refer now to archives of which the noble lord has heard. I will refer to the archives of that office over which he has long presided, and I tell the noble lord that if he will refer to the correspondence with foreign Governments now in the archives of Downing-street, during the month of December, 1854, and January, 1855, and if he will assist me to obtain (which I believe would not be necessary) any evidence which might be requisite to elicit some of the Dassages, I will undertake to prove every tittle of the assertions that I have made. I hope that the Rouse vill at least admit that I have not avoided coming to a frank issue with the noble lord. (lear, hear.) When this question was discussed the other night the noble lord, as is his cu,tom, treated a very grave subject in a spirit and tone of levity. Icannotsaythat Iadmired his tone upon that occasion (laughter), because if there was any foundation for what I stated it required at least the attention of a Minister. But if, on the other hand, it was an inconsiderate, and, still more, if it were intended to be an untrue statement, it was not in a tone of ribald ridicule (cries of "Oh P') that he ought to have answered it bat rather in that of iirm, warm, and overwhdming indignation. (Hear.) And hoC stands the case? If on a grave matter I had made an inconsiderate statement my character s a politician might have been damaged or destroyed; but, II had invented astatement, it was not a question of my character as a politcian, but as a member of society itself. If my conduct was susceptible of so grave an imputation, surely the leader of this House ought to have assumed a very different tone. I have sat in this house 20 years. I have laboured assiduously to obtain the good opinion and respect of this House. They are to me dearer than all worldly possessions. I am conscious that I have frequently addressed the House with inefficiency and sometimes, probably, with indiscretion. But this I know, that I have always treated the House 'with candour. Whether the noble lord the other night in his answer to me treatede th the same spirit I care not to inquire. (Cheers.)I
Lord PALMBIRSTON.-The right hon. gentleman says that the question at issue involves his character for judgment, and, perhaps, for honour; but I beg to call to the recollection of the House that nothing that I said or insinuated upon the occasion to which he refers could in any way justify him in saying that I caUed in question his honour, his candour, or his judgment. (" Oh, ohl') I did not accuse him of having invented the statement which he made. (" Oh, oh l") What I accused him of was the credulity which induced him to believe in the veracity of his information. (Hear.) And, therefore, I can only say that I very much regret that he should harbour in his mind any notion that there was anything in what I said that at all brought in question that honour which no msn intends to impugn. He finds fault 'with me for not being angry (laughter), and for having treated him with too much good humour. He says that I treated his statement in a tone of ribald ridicule, Now, those who make themselves ridiculous are, of all men in the world, those who are most inclined to complain of the manner in which their ridiculous condact is treated by others, forgetting allthe while that theythemselves are the inevitable cause of that ridicule. The right hon. gentleman has stated very accurately a part of my contradiction; but he has omitted some other inIortant portions of it. (Hear, hear.) I beg to remind the House that the charge which he brought against Her Majesty's Government was, that they were anxious to maintain the possessions of Austria in Italy. Daring a debate last session he stated that among the principles of foreign policy supported by the party of which he was the leader was that of maintaining an alliance between England, Russia, Austria, and the United States. I had occasion to point out to him that he had omitted by accidentto mnention France, with which country we happened to be in most intimate alliance and for the most important objects. Bat being of opinion that a close and intimate alliance with Austria was part of a sound policy, he could not in the abstract object to the British Governnment being a party to measures tending to secure the integrity of the Austrian dominions. And, in-
eed, he has fairly stated this evening that he thinks that it ;s for the general interest of Europe that the dominions of Austria, not only tothe north, but, ifIunderstood him corr.toly, to thesouth of the Alps also, shouldnot be diminished. What, then, was the charge which he brought against Her Majesty'sGovornment? Whythis, that while professing openlyto have great interest in the welfare of the Italian people, and t i sympathize with their aversion against a foreign yoke, ,t secretly instigated and encouraged the French Government in giving a guarantee with respect to the Italian possessions of Austria entirely at variance with that pretended sym. pathy. I stated that which I now repeat-that to the best of my knowledge and behef there is no treaty between France and Austria guaranteeing the Italian possessions of Austria. Nor has the right hon. gentleman given any proof of it. (Hear, hear.) He has not explained the grounds upon which he makes his assertios, and therefore it rests now, as it did on a former evening, Eimply upon the hearsay evidence of what somebody or other, whose name is not mentioned, has told him. He has talked of good taste. Of course, every man is the best judge of the course which he should take with regard to the communications which he may receive ; but it appears tomethat if a person is informed that there is a secret engagement between two other parties, he cannot in ordinary cases deem himselfto beat libertyto makethat secret engagement public without the consent of some of the parties con cerned in it. (Hear, hear.) My hon. friend the late Mr. Hfume used constantly to a-sk us to lay before the House a statement of the appIication of the secret service money (laughter) ; but secresy and publication seem to be matters not easily reconcileable. The right hon. gentleman admits that nothing has occurred which renders it neessary for him in the performance of his public duties to divulge this secret transaction, but he tells us that, in anticipation that something might occur at some fature time, he has thought it necessary to informthe House, on the earliest occasion, of this secret transaction between two foreign independent Powers. That is entirely a matter for his owLn discretion. What I stated the other evening was this :-I said that we did not believe in the existence of any such tseaty, that 'we had never heard of any such treaty, and unless the right hon. gentleman had seen it-unless he had access to archives of
wbich we knew nothing, and made his statement upon his own knowledge, it was my opinionthaht he hadbeen imposed upon by erroneous information received from some quarter or other. (Hear, hear.) I also said that the only founda. tion which I could imagine for the statement which he had made was that in the early part of the war, when there was a bope that Austria mightjoin the allies against Russia, cominunications did take place between France and Austria, the object of which on the part of the latter Power was to
seertain that if she took past with the allies, and her armies were withdrawn, France would not take advantage of this state of things to molest her in Italy. (Hear, hear.) That, as I believe, is the only foundation which exists for the statement of the right hon. gentleman:. He has mentioned the date of December, 1854, and there are gentlemen in the honse, not members of the Government, vwho were members of the Admiuistration at that time, and who will correct me if I erroneously state what was the course of events. In the latter part of the year 1854 it wa; hoped that Austria would join offensively and defensively with England and France, and that her armies would come into hostile collision with those of Russia. Well, she wished to know what, if Russia did that which it was highly probable that as a belligerent she might do, and which she might have done without any great departure from the practice of balligerents-what, if Russia instigated insurrections in Italy for the purpose of distracting the attention of Austria, would be the course which the French Government would
;ursue!ThezrenchGovezrment n4-redthatfrAustria that inthe ce suppod Frace would behave as honorle aly ought, and that shae would not encourage any such risings or disturbanecs;- Moreover, that if the Austrian 9linies joined those o Eingland and France, and during the war disturbances should break oat in Italy, whatever French force might be in that countr7-and there would of coursebe a smaUforce there -wouldactin ^'ncert with what. ever force the Austrians might have for the purpose of maintaining, not the Austrian possessions, but the general state of territorial posse-sions in Italy. Those arrange~Inents were undoubted~ly known to the English Government (Opposition cheers and counter cheers from thbe Ministerial bxnches) ; very fit andl proper engagemr-ats t'hey were, and very inconsistent would it have been witl. honourable conduct if any other anaswer had been givei. (,Hear, hea'r.) These engagements were embodiecd in Lthe shape of a con. vention, and the right hon. gentleman says that that con. vention was signed on a certain day in December. I can only say that the information which the Government received no laterthaa Yeaterday,frour a quarter likely to kniow,
'sures us that that convention never was signed. But that convention was as different from the treaty whic b the right hon. gentleran mentioned as it
is possible for two things to be. (Cheers.) Between' that and a guarantee there isv as I have read, and as he has
read, in a French periodical,' "ant abyss -" there is a gulf' which separates the two by' ani impassable barrier. There. fore, thatwhich I denied the other night, and which I againdeny, is that there is, to our kiowledge and beief, in existence any treaty which was ever signed and concluded by whichL France guLaranteed the Italian possin ofAustria. (Cheers.)I amo inclined to think tha th e information
which we havereceived is correct, and that that treav, that conventionx.for it was only a temporary convention, to bave force only dluring the periocd of the continuance of the war (hear, hear)-never was signed. Why? Because the foundation of it was the assumption that Austria shoula join England and France in active operations agairrnst Russia. (Cheers.) ANstria did not join in those active operations. It was her poicy, of which she alone was entitled to judge, to reminas neutral in the conflict. The case upon wvhich the agreement was founded never arose, and therefore I aa inclined to beiehve that the information which we have receivod is nore correct than is that of the right hon. gentleman, and that, in fact, this limited econ ventierhichmited in its duration, limited in its effects, limited in its operation-never was ined, or concluded between the parties, No doubt the honour-able intention which that convention was designedl to record would have been acted upon if the ce to which it was intended to apply had arisen, butlIsay th at it is a total misapplication of terms, a total perversionh of things, to represent such an rangeinent as that as a guarantee by France of the Austrianps sessions in Italy. (Chers.) Now, Sir, the right ho. gentleman having repeated his assertion, I only repeat the denial which I then gave to it. I beg the right hon. gentleh manos pardon fornot having been angry witi him the other
nigt. (A laughe ) I really cannot muster up T'o-igot
even niow.

THE INC0llE-TAX.
Major REED, who had uton the paper a motion upon the subject of the "war ninepeace, rose, and was stating to the House the circumstance attending the recent agitationx uaponx the subject and the holding of the meeting at Exeter-hall, at which he pledged himsel to place such a resolution upon the books of the House, when
The SPEAXER inquirea if he intendecl to proceedl with his maotion ?
Major REED said that he didI not.
The SPEAKER intimnated that if the hon. member did not intend la move his resolution he was not entitled to address the H7ouse.
Major REED said in that case he should conclude by! making the motion which stood in his name ("No,
no"), but it was not his intention to press his motion to a I dlvision. His oaly object was to make a short statement for the vindication of his own character. The Chancellor of the Exchequer having, in a manner which did him great credit, promaised to bring forward his budget on Friday next, it was his (Major Reed's) wish to postpone his motion, in the belief that the right hon. baronet would satisfy the just expectations of the country by his forthcoming financial statement. After defending the agitation in the country forthe repealof the war ninepencefroithe aspersionsrecently cast upon it by the Vice-President of the Board of Education at ertford, as being alike " vain, futile, and unnecessary," the hon. and galant member concluded by asking leave to withdrawv his resolution.
The motion was withdrawn.
INDUSTRIAL SCBOOLS.
Sir S. NOBTEICOTE, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to make better provision for the care and education of vagrant, destitute, and disorderly children, and for the extension of industrial schools, observed that it was not his intention at present to trouble the House at any length, because this measure was in princple the same as one that had already been passed for Scotlan an was comuonly known as Dunlop's Act. Its details were, indeed, necessarily somewhat different, in order to adapt them to the circumstances of England; and although they would require the careful consideration of the House, yet that consideration would be more satisfactorily bestowed on them when the bill was in the hands of ho. members. It was, however, incumbent on him now to state very briefly the main grounds why such a measure ought to b introduced. The large class of children to vhom the bill referred was one peculiarly demanding their care and attention, not simply from motives of humanity, but from reasons of State poliey connected with our criminal legislation. The difficulty of dealing with our criminals would be materially dininished if we could cut off the supply of those criminals i at its source; and,as the worst of them were those who had been trained to crime from their earliest years, the best interests of society would be consulted by takingDthem in hand before they became hardened. It might be asked, why not leave it to the reformatory schools to work out this object ? Those schools were no doubt doin'
great good; and, though much was yet required to bring them to completion, it might perhaps seem better to allow that system to perfect itself before we dealt with another class. But looking to the large number of children now running a6out our streets, and constantly swelling the ranks from which those schools, supported as they were, in part at least, from the public purse, were recruited ; and looking, moreover, to the likelihood of those ranks bemg thinned by the adoption of a measurelike that now operating in Scotiana, it would be well to reflect whether it would not be wiser and more economical to apply such an act at once to England. The reports of our prison inspectors showed that about 7,000 children were annualy added to the criminal class of this country, but that number represented a much larger body of children who ran about the streets, getting constantly into trouble, and continually coming into the hands of the police, and on whom our present schools failed to make any impression. Jn Bristol, last year, there were apprehended of this class 525e chldren under 16 years of age, of whom only 126 were committed for trial or summarily convicted, the remainder being left to wander about uncared for. In Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and other populous towns a similar state of things unhappily prevailed.. This class not only constituted a dangerous element in our society, but
from their neglected condition, had streng claims on our pity. Our existing institutions were inadequate to meet their case. The national schools were too high to reach them. The children with whom his bill proposed to deal would not choose to mix in their rags with the children of a superior class who now attended the national suhools, neither was the dipline of those schools such as was necessary for the government of children of the lowest class, who required not a high scale of education, but the training of strict discipline and controL Neither were the reformatory schools suitable for those children, whom, not having yet committed crime, it would be uniust to associate with tho3e who had. The ragged and industrial schools which had been established throughout the country were the places for the children with whom his bill proposed to deal; but the difficulties at present were a want of control to compel chUdren to attend, and a lack of means. He proposed to adopt the principle of the Scotch act, which gave the magistrates a power to commit to school aUl
children found in the streets begging or committing acts of' vagrancy. It was true great care must be taken to define
the class of children who should be subject to the exercise I of this power; but if that were done he had no doubt the1 schools at present in existence and those which might hereafter spring up would be sufficient for all purposes. A Large proportion of the children who were to be found wandering about the streets had been either deserted by their parents or were encouraged by them to beg or steal; therfor a rinipa fetur oftheScotch act had been tutroduced inpto this bill tao umake fhthe parents liable n beveruy case for the maintenance of their children in those sehools.
Allusion haa been made to the small sums collected froui parents under the* Reformatories Act, and the difficualty of collecting even that, but he submitted that the principal object of requiring those paynients was notso mnuch to relieve the Treasury as to operate up n the minda of parents, and
n that respect he thought that provision had not been with-I out effect. He found from a letter he had received from~ Mr. Dann, the chief constable of Newcastle-on.Tyne, that since the act had been enforced in that district the number of juvenile criminals had diminished one-half and he knew that many morents -who formerly sent their children to beg and steal aout the streets bad discontinued the practice, and sent them instead to some of the free schools of the town. The head constable of Live I had given similar testimony, and therefore he (Sir 5 0 cAtoteI thought, as thte effect of the provision in theReformatoniesAct,rendering, the parents liable for the maintenance of their children, had been so beneficial, there could be little doubt as to t-he desirability of extending it to children who were idle and vagrant, but not yet criminals. In support of this bill he would cal the attention of the Hlouse to the successful worldug of the Scotch act, the operation of which had been attended by a marked decreas iui the committals of juvenile offenders. In Aberdeen, before the establishment of the free schools, the average number of 'juvenile vagrants taken into custody by the pollee was .342 while the average nunmber in five yeers after their esta6lsment was onl six. With such evidence of the succesful operation of thte system In Scotland, be thought the House would regardl its extension to England as a wise measure of economay and humanity. The subject was one whbich had excited much interest. A

Mr. COCHIRANE confime th tatement of the hon. baronet as to the admirable manner in which the Scotch set had been found to act, and mentioned tat 8hPer cent. of the children wbo bad been sent to the Hross,e of Refuge at Glasgowr had been found, after quitting that institttion, to be pursuing an honest career of industry.
Mr. KINNAIRD also bore testimony to the xoellent effects of the Scotch act, and thought its exten.ion to England would be of the highest advantage to the country.
Sir G. GREY said he should not object to the introduction of the bill, but must withhold any promise of support until he had seen the details upon which so much wotld depend.
Leave was then given for the introduction of the bill.
THE BEER TRADE.
The Rouse, on the motion of M1r. HARDY, then went into committoe on the acts regulating the sale of beer.
M1r. HARDY, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to amend the laws relating to the sale of beer, and to regulato certain places of public resort, refreshment, and entertainment, excused himself for presuming to take up a subject of such importance, on the grounds that the Government were overwhelmced with business, that he had been re quested to do so, and that he felt a deep interest in it. The question of regulating the sale of beer had been dealt with by Parliament on several occasions, and every attempt seemed the more to show that the system was unsuitable to the wants and feelings of the country. (Hear, hear.) The first aec in the first year of William IV. allowed any person to obtain a license from the Excise for the sale of beer on the payment of 21. 2s. That was found objectionable, and in the fifth year of the same reign another act was passed rendering it necessary that the house should hc of the oateable value of 101, and requiring certificates of good character from six inhabitants, sined by the overseer. The House knew how easily certificates of character were obtained, and that even among the higher classes g.entlemen were not ashamed to put their names to testimonals which were not strictly true. In the 3d and 4th of Victoria another attempt was made to remedy the evils by raising the rating in towns of 10,000 inhabitants to 151., and requiring a certificate of rating fromthe overseers. By collusion with overseers the provisions of that act were evaded. In 1834 a committee of the House sat to inquire into the evils of drunkenness. They declared that, in their opinion, the beershops were, to a great extent, the cause of intoxi. cation, and they offered some strong recommendations, which were not, however, carried into effect. In 1849 and 1850 Lord Harrowby obtained a committee of the House of Lords to incquire into the nature and character of beershops; and It was proved that the comfort and morals of the poor had been seriously impaired by their operation. Another committee in 1853 and 1854 reported that the beershop system was established in the hope that the public would obtain beer cheap and pure in houses where the disorders incident to houses for the sale of spirits would not occur, but that hope had proved fallacious. Nothing resulted from the committee, except a controversy on Sundaydrinkingwhich hemuchregretted, and into which hewould notenter, as the bill he proposed to intro. duce did not affect that part of the question. iHe believed that at present there were not less than 41,000 beershops in England, besides 89,000 publichouses. In Manchester one house in 35 and in Leeds one house in 45 were devoted to the sale of intoxicating liquors. In large towns there was every facility for drankenness, and in the secluded districts, where these houses were removed from the close supervision of the police, they were also used in the commission of crime. When people said that drunkenness was becoming less, his answer was that there were no statistics on which reliance could be placed. In some towns no drunken persons were taken up unless they were riotous and disorderly; in othei pIaces, if they were taken up, they were only locked up for the night, discharged in the morning, and never brought before a magistrate. They were, therefore, unable to tell whether drankenness was decreasing or not; but every one knew that destitute wives andchildren camne apon the poor-rates in consequence of their husbands and fathers haunting publichouses and beershops, and that there would be less necessity for reformatories and industrial schools if Parliament had done its duty in protecting the morals of the people from their destructive and baneful influences. In this view he was confirmed by Mfr. Wright, the philanthropist, who said that of all destitute children there was not one whose misery and destitution could not be traced to the neglect of parents who indulged in drunkenness. Although the right hon. baronet (Sir George Grey) referred last night to the great diminution of crime, yet, on reference to the criminal returns, he found that crimes nurtured by drunkenness-where the victim, being drunk, tempted men to rob him, or where men, being drunk first assaulted and then robbed-had greatly increased. in the five years fromihiB to 1851 the number of robberies was l,51. In the five years from 1851 to 1855 they were 2,377, having increased 21 per cent. He did not wish to make a sweeping charge against every man who kept a beershop, because he knew there wvere many exceptions, and that numbers in the metropolis were as well conducted as publichouses; but it was proved before the committee of 1853-51 that beershops were places where thieves met, where stolen goods were disposed of, where burglars planned their attacks, and whexe poschers and sheep-stealers associated before starting on their expeditions. It seemed remarkable that, while the system had been complained of for 26 years, no attempt had been made to put beershops on the same footing as publichouses. lWe knew there were great objectionsto casting on magistrates the onerous duty of licensing, and that the magistrates were charged with evincng partialty. The complaints came from persons whose applications had been refused, and, although he could not deny that some magistrates might act improperly, he asserted that, on the whole, they had done their dutv efficiently. It might be asked whether he could show any difference between publchouses and beershops ? He said he could. The chief constable of Bradford gavo a return of all the convictions of publichouses and beershops. There were 135 publichouses in the town and 240 beershops. The offences of publichouses were only 5 in the year 1850, being 1 in 27; of beershop-keepers, 42, or more than I in 6. In Manchester the convictions of publicans were 22 per cent., and of beersho-keepers 47 per cent. MIr. Hogg, the chief constable of 1Wolverhampton, ascribed the greater respectability of publicans to their having once a-year to meet the magistrates and the black book of the police. Three romedies had been proposed-first;;to throw open the trade in beer and in spirits to unrestricted competition, but to make the licenses very high: second, to grant licenses on high terms, bnt to restrict the number of houses according to area andpopalation ; and, third1 to resort to the Maine Law. with respect to the first, it appeared to him that if the licenses were very high it would tend to prohibit the trade, and if not too high to leave the trade remunerative there would Ib far too many houses under a system of unrestricted competition. The chief constable of Bradford told him there were 27 beersellers in that town who kept prostitutes in their honsem, and 10 had brothels upon, or attached to, their premises. The restriction of the number of licenses according to the population was impossible, because the population upon different areas was so variously distributed. With rega-d to the Maine Liquor Law he had the highest respect for those who advocated it, but it would first be neemsary for them to purge their own houses; and, as he admitted he was not
repared to give up either wine or beer, lie should consider to was only acting a part in a system of organized hypocrisy if he attempted to compel the humbler classes to give up those beverages. (Hear, hear.) It would be necessary to search the cellars of Bellany's for spirituous liquors, as the cellars were now searched for gunpowder, if the Miaine Law were adopted. This law could only be carried when nmen had adopted its principles in their own persons, and then there would be no need of it. Forinerly there used to be a great deal of drunkenness among the higher classes. The Germnan princes used to go to bed drunk every night, and drunkenness was very common in country houses. But as a reformationhad taken place in the higher and middle classes, so he believed that it was spreading through the lower classes, and that they also were learning to enjoy themselves moderately. (Hlear.) He now camec to the provisions of his bill. In the first place he proped to adopt the recommendation of the committee of 185a, a And to resnect vested interests. Where licenses had been given, therefore, no alteration could take place; and until the 41,000 beershops now in existence changed hands or the licenses were withdrawn, they would bo tak-en out of the category of those beershops to which the magistrates gave licenses. He propDsed that beershop licenses should ba granted at all annual licensing meetings, and also, where necessary, at eight special mectings throughout the year. The new police afforded the means of investigating the character of the persons applying for licenses, and also of those who certified to the character of the applicants and the amount of their rating. He proposed that persons intending to apply for licenses should give 21 days' notice to the superintendent of police, and should furnish him with a copy of their application, and of the documents by which it was to be supported. The magistrates would then be furnished with all the materials for forming a judgment. At present no beershop-keeper forfeited his license except after a third conviction, and the mnagistrates had then io give the Excise notice, so that the license might be withdrawn. But upon this point the evidence was singularly conflicicng, for, while some of the ?nagistrates stated that they were in the habit of sending ir,fornation to the Excise, r. Wood, Chairman of the
Board of Inland Revenue, said he could hot call to mind that he had ever received one of these notices. The Excise,
indeed, received the certificates and issued the licenses in a rerfimetory manner, since they had no means of inquiry. Thus it sometimes happened that the magistrates deprived publicans of their icenses for notorious and
flagrant crimes. These nmen then obtained an Excise
license for the sale of beer, and kept open their houses under the noses of the magistrates. This was an intolerable evil and abuse. (Hear, hear.) He proposed, therefore, to put all these houses nnder the same jurisdiction. He sbould also propose to carry out the clauses of the Tippling Act with regard to beer. A petition had been presented to-night which had been forwarded and favoured by the County Court judge of Salford upon this subject, which stated that beershop-lkeepers sometimes sued a man
for debts of 12. or 141., which the debtor declared he knew nothing about. He proposedthat no beershop-keeper should sue for beer drunk on the premises, unless he commenced his action within one week. It would be hard where a
man bad treated a great number of persons on the samo night that the beershop-keeper should have no remedy.
The committee of 18534 proposed to put coffeeshops under the supervision of the police. The keepers of coffeeshops in the metropolis were forbidden to harbour bad characters, butthepolice wereunable toenter tbhesehousesuess withthe assent oftho proprietors. He did notpropose to touch either coffehops or temperance hotels, or shell-fih shops that were open by day, but only those that were open between the
hours of 9 o'clock at night and 4 o'clock in the mornni. These houses at present required supervision, for when people were turned outof the cjlhousesthey went to thesehouss
where spirits were illicdtly sold. In IS54 Mr. HIart the superintendent of the police of Wolverhampton, who wiss in London to give evidence before the comsmtteo, went into
one of these coffeeshops at ngbt and asked for some giu.
T hey gave him some without ifficulty, but Dot in a glass, They served it to him in a coffee-cup, and told him that if the police came he must pour some nAilk into the in, and then tbey would think it was coffee. (Alugh.) He proposed that these houses so open between the hours of 9 and 4 ehould be licensed and pay a small sum annualy, and that tbey should be subject to the supervision of the police in the game manner as beershops. He also proposed to levy pen!ties forselling spirits, forharbouring disorderly characters, ano oermitting gambling. A clause in the Towls Police Bill pliphibited the assemblage of disorderly cbar4qters in houses ; this deacription, and this clause was adopted in most private improvetint bills, Thereaseemed however, no reason why it should not be egtotidd orer the whole country. He proposed to levy flnes upon drmuken and disorderly persons rwho refused to leave these houses when required by the landlord or his servants ; and he proposed not only to fine the landlords for permitting spirits to be drunk, but also to fine those who were found drinking spirits in these houses. He was glad to hear that the Government did not intend to oppose the introduction of his biU. (Hear.) The aim of the bhl vas to improve the condition of the poorer classes, to diminish their temptations, to promote their domestic enjoyments, to render them better husbands and better fathers, and without some such bill as this all the efforts which were being made for the spread of education would bee entirely frustrated. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and learned gentleman concluded by moving for leave to bring in his bill.
Mr. E. BALL seconded the motion. Publichouses and beershops were the great sources of vice and the nurseries of debauchery, and the zealous efforts made by benevolent individuals for the improvement of the condition of the poor were completely thwarted by their influence. From a compendium of criminal statistics which had been furnished him he found that in one year there had occurred from drunkenness alone 711 brawls and violent assaults, 294 robberes, 237 cases of atrocious cruelty to wives and children, 166 seriotts accidents, 162 cases of succesful or attempted suicide, 520 h,"rrible deaths, and 120 murders and manslaughters. No less than 44 chaplains of gaols, examined before Lord Harrowby's committee, gave it as the result of their experience of the criminal population that drunkenness was by far the most fertile source of crime; and the experience of the city missionaries was entirely to the same effect.
Sir G. GREY said, there could be no doubt as to the effect which drunkenness had in increasing crime, aud the grat point to be solved was the best means of reventineg,P -enness. How far the provisions of the hon and Learned gentleman's bill would have that effect would be better discussed at a future stage than at present. Thecommittee of 1853-54 had taken a great deal of evidence on the liensing system and the beerhouse system, and the conclusion they came to as to the expediency of abolishing the distinction between beerhonses and publichouses was the same as that of the hon. and learned gentleman, but they came to a very different conclusion as to the hands in which the hcensing power should be placed. (Hear.) It woould be well if hon.members,before the second reading of the bill, 'would look into the evidence taken by that committee5 which contained much useful information on this subject. As a great deal of interest would no doubt be excited in the country by the biUl on account of the great amount of uroperty embarked in this trade, as weU as from other and higher causes, be would suggEest that a sufficiently long interval should elapse before thge econd reading to allow the public to become well acquainted with its provisions.
Sir J. PAKINGTON thought there was no subject on which public opinion was more unanimous than this; and the bon. and learned gentleman was entitled, therefore, to their warm thanks for having laid this bill before them. It ought not to have been left, however, to a private membar to deal with the subject, for, the country had a right to expect that the Government would undertake to legislate upon it. The attention of Parliament had been constantly directed to the question for the last six or seven years. The committee which sat in 1853 and 1854 was suggested by tho Prime Minister, then Home Secretary, and there certainly had been a general expectation that the Government would, after the long sitting of that committee, have seen the necessity of legislating on the subject. He therefore thought that the House ought to feel greatly indebted to the hon. and learned gentleman for bringing forward his bill. But, looking to the nature of the bil and the interests involved, he warned the hon. and learned gentleman not to be too sanguine as to the passing of his measure, mless he recegivetd from thte Government that assistance which h e had
Mr. WILKINSON said, there could be no question about the importance of stopping the crime of drunkenness, but he thought that the proposition to limit the number of drinking-bouses was beginning at the wrong end. People did not drink merely because drinking-houses existed. It was a fact that the great diminution of drunkenness had taken place among the class which had an unbounded command of intoxicating liquors, rather than among that whose means were limited. The hon. and learned gentleman said that these drininknhonses were the resort of poachers and vagabonds, and thmat robberies wrere concocted n them; but did the hon. and learned gentleman suppose that robberies were never concocted in counting-houses and banking houses9
Mr. LOWE observed, in reply to the night hon. baronet the member for Droitwitoh, who called upon the Government to support the present bill because they supported the appointment of the committee of 1853 and 1854, that the effect of the bil would be to limit the number of publchouses, whereas, on the contrary, the effect of the report of the committee was that the trade should be altogether thrown open.
Mr. E. CEOSSLEY believed that every additional drinking-house was an additional temptation to drunkenness. The subJect ought to have been dealt with by the Government; but the hill would introduce a reformi, and would be supported by a great part of the trade, who wished to keep well-regulated houses, and who were in favour of licenses being granted by magistrates and not by
Mr. W. BROWN expressed a hope that the Government twoeuld nJot let the session pass without bringing in a bill on
Mr. SC HO LEFIELI) entirely differed from the bon. and learned gentleman as to the remedy he proposed for drunkenness, and he had not so much faith in magistrates as to give them instead of the E3xcise the granting of licenses.
Mfr. EWABT thought that the real remedy against drunkenness-namely, the education of the people-was not sufficientlv attended to. The real source of the evil was not entirely in these drinking bionscs, but in the character of the people,who were snore likely to be kept away from those plaCes by instruction than by restrictive measures. Nevertheless, he WaS glad to see the zeal of the hon. and learned gentlem.an, and should hc pleased if the hon. ar.d learned gentleman could, by wise and not too severe regulatious, put a check upon an enormous evil.
After a few words from Mr. Mx,oras,
Mr. HAiRDY replicd,-He wished to maintain a distinction betfeen beers iOpS and publichouses, as he thought it was of the utmost imnportance that those who frequented beershops should not be tempted there by the sale of ardent spirits, lie w.as surprised to hear an lion, member say that drunkenness was not increased hy adding to the number of taverns and beerhouses. The throwing open of spirit licenses during the last century had produced a degree of drunkenness quite horrible to contemplate, and Lord Chesterfield denounced thc actj which produced that addition as a measure which sanctioned the sale of poison. He (Mr. Hardy) w;as a freotrader in everything but in the sale of into.xicating liquors, because he believed that a system of restriction was the only means by which drunkenness could he checked.
Leave was given to introduce the bill, and the HIouse resumed.
CONTRACTS FOR PUBLIC DEPARTHIENTS.
Colonel DUNNE moved the reappointment of the select committee to inquire into the principle adopted for making contrasts for the supply of the public departments, and the effect which ;the present system had upon the expenditure of public money.
Agreed to.
ECCLESIiASTICA.J. CORPORATIONS.
The MTarquis of B3lANDFORD moved for leave to bring in a bill to provide for the mode of securing and paying fixed incomes to ecclesiastical corporations, waggregats andi sole, which he said was similar, except in some points of detail (whichhbewould explain on a subsequent occasion), to the bill which he had introeduced in the previous session on this subiect. He behieved that those alterations would promote the general efficiency of the bill.
Sir S. NORTECOTE: seconded the motion.
Mr. WALPOLE hoped that the noble maro,uis would not press forward the bill until the Ecclesiastical Comimassoners had presented their report.
Leave was then granted to bring in the bill.
STA^TUTE LAWr.
Lord PALMIERSTON moved the appointment of a select committee to consider so much of the second report of the Statute Lawv aCommissicnera as related to the proposition therein made for the adoption of means to improve the manner and languageo of current legislation, and to report their opinion thereupon to the House. Nothing (said the noble lord) could be more important than the proper framsirg of the hills which received the sanction of Parliament. Everybody who had turned his attention to the
subject must have seen how, from oversight, new enactments conflicted with the existing laws. Hle remembered that a few years ago a bill was brought into the house one of the clauses of which, owving to an oversight in the grammatical construction, provided for the case in which Good Friday should fail on Sunday. (Laughter.) From a want of sufficient care many bills failed to preserve that harmony which should exist between laws just enacted and those previously in operation. And it was not at all to ba wondered at that such was the fact, when it was considered that biUs were frequently brought in by an independent mtmber, who resorted to the best assistance which he could command in order to enable him to place his views before the House in a legislative shape; while other bills were brought in by a member of the Governmenat, who employed an officer whose timie was too much engaged to frame them. Perbaps neither of those framers of bills was able X
give sufficient attention to the subjec' and to examine whether the existing laws upon the same matter conficted or not with the lprovisions ef the bill which he had been instructed to draw. The bill was brought in and underwent alterations in the course of debate. They all knew how comsnittees of the whole lRouse dealt with bills, especially with those having many clauses, and upon complicated subjects. Some member had a particular case in his mind for which he wished to provide, and moved a clause. The mover of the bill, taken suddenly, finding that to accept the clause would smooth the passage of the bill and, probably, having no opportunityor means of conparg the proposed enactment wsth the other parts of the bil, or with the existin hlaw, adopted it. The bil having passed that House went o the other, where, in the ame way, alterationsan amendments wvere made in it withbout their effect being sufficintly ascertained; and freq,uently a bi was
adoptecl the usal course of showing that public advantage would result from the granting of the returns that there was some grievance to be redressed, or abuse to be removed. The hon. member seemedto tbink that the publication of the returns would stisfy the minds of some persons whowere now discontented, and therefore, although no such ground as was usuaUy put forward in cases like the present had been made out, he should not oppose the granting of the returns.
The motion was then agreed to.
The Industrial SchoolsBill, the Ecclesiastical Corporations Bill, the Sale of Beer Bil, and the Chief Constables Bill were brought in and severally read a firt time.
The House adjourned at balf -past 8 o'clock,

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, FBBBUARY 11, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night, after some preliminary business had been despatched,
The LoRD CAtwCE=onR caUed the attention of the House to the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and stated his intentions as to the testamentary jurisdiction of the existing Prerogative Courts, the law of divorce, and the law for the correction of clerks. After sketching the origin and progress of the testamentary jurisdiction, and showing how what was now purely a temporal court came to be called by an ecclesiastical name, he procecded to give an outline of the chief features of his measure for reforming the tribunals which now exercised a jurisdiction over wils. The principal changes which he proposed to make were to constitute a new court, to be called the Qaeen's Court of Probate, which, except in certain cases, was not to have jurisdiction over real estate, and over which a judge should preside, who would direct issuos on matters of fact to be tried by a jury. In this court the proctors-of whom he declared that he should have no objection to be rid after having felt his way-would at first have the common form business, while the contentioux businesswould be thrown open to solicitors and barristers, who, together with the proctors and advocates, would have the right of practising inthe new court. With regard to wills bequeathing propertyup to 1,5001., he proposed tbat, if uncontested, they should be proved In a districtcourt, but if contested they should be disposed of in the Court of Probate in London, the office of Judge beinrg discharged by one of the Vice-Chancellors. Wils which diposed of prorty below 2001. he proposed should be decided on by the County Courts. With regardto divorce, he proposed, inthe billwhich hewas aboutto introduce, toallowawoman to obtain a decree of separation fromher hnsband if he should desert her for three years, and, under certain circumstances, to give her the right of a postnuptial as well as an antenuptial settlement; these were the new features of the bill, the whole provisions of which, based on the measure rejected last year, would be more clearly seen when the measure was laid on the table. With regard to ecclesiastical discipliae, the offences of clerks night be divided into the two heads of moral and doctrinal offences, and, the proceedings in each of those cases being exceedingly cumbrous and expensive, he proposed to simplify them. In the case of doctrinal offences it was not intended to allow a suit to be promoted voluntarily by any one person, but that proceedings should only be taken after a certificate had been obtained, signed by a certain number of persons of station in the Church. The Ions CsrA?icnrctor. then laid these bils on the table with the exception of the Clergy Offences Bill.
Lord LYNDInMRST thought that the Testamentary Jurisdcltion Bill would not satisfy the public. In the first place, it transferred the testamentary jurisdiction to Chancery in substance, though not, perhaps, in terms. Now, this was the main objection to the bill brought in last year by the present Arroxix-GxExEsA, when it had been said that no sane person would increase the jurisdiction of that Court. Having proved his point that the proposed Court would be substantially a Court of Chancery, the noble lord went on to complain that the appeal from this new court would not be, as now, to that most popular tribunal the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but to the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, and the House of Lords, an arrangement which would be at once unatisfactory to the suitor and cause enormous additional expense. So far from being a bil to establish a Court of Probate, it was, on the contrary, one to abolish the Court of Probate, and to adjoin its jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery. The chief feature of the procedure of this new oourt was one which had always been held to be a main objection against the Court of Chancery itself, he meant its inability to try matters of fact. Thes, he thought, were adequate objections to the bilL Nor had the very difficult question of compensation to the practitioners whose business the bill proposed to annihilate been mentioned. Surely, the House would require some estimate of the probable amount of that compensation, in order that it might know that it was not about to pay too highly for a me-e transfer of jurisdiction. After stating several objeCtions to the other measures proposed by the LORD Cn"cmaoR, the noble lord concluded by regretting that he had not incorporated in the Divorce Bill a clause to abolish the action for criminal conversation, which was a disgrace to the nation.
The Bishop of ExaTrXa having stated his general approbation of the measures proposed by the LOBD
CHANJCaLOB,
Lord CA-,vPBEL expressed his dismay at hearing that any married couple, after a tesnporary disagreement or after improper collusion, might obtain a divorce for all practical purposes except marrying again. With regard to the testamentary jurLsdiction, he hoped that the new court would not be made an adjunct to Chancery, to be thrown into which he knew many persons in the other House of Parliament considered the greatest calamity that could befall a man. With the best intention to support these measures, he felt that the LoBD CHai%NcaLwOR was not exactly in the right course at present.
Lord BROUGHAMI objected to the proposed Testamentary Bill, because it constituted a new tribunal under an equity judge exercising a common-law jurisdiction. What possible pretext coull there be for depriving Sir JoHN DODSON of bis fun¢-
tions and giving them to a Vice-Chancellor? He had no doubt that both the common form and the contentious business would be transacted -quite as well by the existing Prerogative Court as by any other court, but he thought that if any new tribunal were to be erected it should be a Court of Probate, presided over b a common law judge. In conclu5ion the noble lord objected to certain details of the other measures.
After some further discussion, in which Lord WENSLDEAIE, the Bishop of OxFORD, and Lord CyNyRB took part,
The LoRD CHANCELLOR confessed that the reason why hie did not appoinit Sir JoiN DODSON to be the new judge was that he wished to get rid of the Prerogative Court altogether. The only function of an intellectual character which the judge would have to exercise was that of saying whether he thought the verdict given in a particular case was in accordance with the facts; and if he was asked why he selected one of theVice-Chancellors rather than aijudge of one of the common law courts, his reply Was, that the Vice-Chancellor would be always at hand and ready to do the business of the court. But for that reason, no doubt, the duties would be as well discharged by a judge at common law as by a ViceChancellor.
The bills were then read a first time.
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, in reply to an inquiry by Mr. GrXGSON, whether, in consequence of the doubts thrown by the courts of law upon the validity of advances on the hypothecation of goods or warrants, it was intended to introduce any bill upon the subject,
Mfr. LowF, after explaining the case of "K -osroRD v. MERRY," stated that the Government were willing to introduce a bil as soon as they were satisfied that it would meet the wishes of the mercantile community.
In answer to Mr. J. EWAERT, who asked whether it was intended to make any recognition of the services of Sir JoEw M'NEmr and 6olonel TuttocH,
Lord PAiriu ToN declared that those gentlemen had performed their duty entirely to the satisfaction of HiER MAJEsTY'S Government, to their own credit, and with great ability, perseverance, and minuteness. At the same time, he observed, it did not appear to the Government that their services were of such a nature as to call for the extraordinary course of conferring upon them honours from the CRowN.
MIr. Disv rAm,-premising that when, eight years ago, he had occasion to refer to a guarantee in the Treaty of Vienna by Great Britain to Prussia of her Saxon provinces, Lord PAL-EI5sTON, then and for 17 years Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had contradicted him, affirming that there was no such guarantee, which was nevertheless found in that treaty,-proceeded to remind the House that on the first night of this session he had referred to a guarantee by France to Austria of her Italian possessions, stating that that guarantee was mentioned in a treaty, and that Lord PA.xEsRTox had in the same manner contradicted him. The treaty in question was not in print, but he (MIr. DrsRAmLa) had a moral conviction that he was correct, having had the information from a quarter that could not be mistaken. Assuming the information to be correct, or that he was convinced that it was so, it was impossible, he observed, that in the course which the debate took, touchinog upon Italian affairs, he could have been silent upon the point. It had not been his intention to impugn the policy which dictated that treaty ; he believed it was conceived in a wise, temperate, and conservative spirit; but, assuming the statement he had madetobe correct, HEMAr 'sMinisters were conveying to the House and to Europe that they were pursuing a policy totally different, and it concerned the honour of the House that there should be a clear understanding, upon the subject. He complained that Italian policy had been made a stalking horse. The contradiction he had received involved two allegations-first, that his statement that a secret treaty was in existence by which France guaranteed to Austria the security of her Italian dominions was a romance; the second allegation was a derisive hypothesis, that if there was such a treaty bIinisters had never seen it or heard of it. With regard to the first, he reaffirmed that engagements were negotiated between France and Austria with the main object of guaranteeino'on the part of France the security of the Austro-Italian dominions ; that those negotiations were brought to a successful conclusion, and expressed in a written instrument, which assumed the form of a secret treaty, and was executed on the 22d of September, 1854. As to the seond allegation, that, if there be such a treaty, HER MAJESTY'S Government had never seen or heard of it, and would have given advice contrary to such a stipulation, he had evidence in his possession, he said, proving that throughout the whole of those negotiations, HER NdAJESTY's Government were privy to them; that the suggestion received their approbation and cordial concurrence; and that the treaty was not only executed with the cognizauce of the Government, but had been largely and extensively acted upon with their knowledge. He added that if Lord PAi3MRsroiN would give him from the archives of the Foreign-office the correspondence in December, 1854, and January, 1855, he would prove every tittle of what he had asserted.
Lord PALzaSToN disclaimed all intention of throwing any imputation upon the personal character or honour of Mr. DISRAELI; all he had imputed to him was credulity in believing implicitly what he had been told regarding this matter. His charge against Hna MAusTY'S Government was that while they professed great interest for the Italians, and to encourage Italian nationality, they instigated and encouraged the Freuch Government to give a guarantee to Austria of her Italian dominions. He (Lord PAL3mRsroN) had said that, to the best of his knowledge, there was no such treaty; nor had Mr. DISRAELT, he said, given any proof of its existence. He had only hearsay evidence from some authority not named. lHe said he believed that, unless Mr. DISRAiu T had seen the treaty, he had been imposed upon; that the only foundation for the statement was that at an early period of the late war communications did take place between France and Austria, in which the former assured the latter that, if she took part in the war France would not take advantage of her by encouraging any rising or disturbances in Italy, andif Austriajoined the allies, and such disturbances broke out, the French force would act in concert with the Austrian. Those engagements were undoubtedly known to the British Govermment, and they were embodied in a convention, but the Government were assured that it never was signed. This convention was, however, entirely different from a guarantee. He still denied that he had any knowledge of a treaty by which France guaranteed to Austria her Italian dominions. The convention was only temporary, and it was not signed, because the contingency of Austria joining England and France in active operations never arose. It was a total misapprehension and a perversion of terms, he said, to represent this as a guarantee.
Major RXED, after some observations, withdrew the resolution of which he had given notice respecting the Income-tax, pending the financial statement of the C-CELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.
Sir S. NonrTHcoTE moved for leave to bring in a bill to make better provision for the care and education of vagrant, destitute, and disorderly children, and for the extension of industrial schools. The effect of the bill, he said, was the same as that which had been passed for Scotland; so that the House had sanctioued the principle, though the details, which he explained, were somewhat different.
After a few words from MIr. B. COCHRANE, Mr. KiNmAxBD, and Sir G. GREY, who did not oppose the motion, leave was given.
The House having resolved itself into a committee,
lr. HaRDY moved that the chairman he instructed to move for leave to introduce a bill to amend the laws relating to the general sale of beer by retail, and to regulate certain places of public resort, refreshment, and entertainment.
Sir G. GRE, observing that the whole question was as to the best means of preventing drunkenness, deferred his opinion upon the measure until he saw its provisions.
A short discussion ensued in the committee, and, the motion being agreed to, leave was given to bring in the bill.
On the motion of Colonel Dwm-NE, the select committee to inquiire into the principle adopted for mnaking contracts for the supply of the public de-
partments, and the effect which the present system has upon the expenditure of public money, was re. appointed.
The Marquis of BLA-'TDPOrD moved for leave to bring in a bill further to provide for the mode of securing and paying fixed incomes to ecclesiastical corporations, aggregate and sole. The bill, he said was the same in principle as the bills which had been read a second time, the difference in the de. tails being improvements of the measure.
Leave was given.
lord PALTBMSION moved for a select committee to consider so much of tlle second report of the Statute Law Commissioners as relates to the proposition therein made for the adoption of means to improve the manner and language of current legislaIon.
The motion, after a short debate, was agreed to.
Sir G. Guta obtained leave to introduce a bill to facilitate the appointment of chief constables for adjoining counties, and to confirm appointments of chief constables in certain case.
After some further business, the House adjourned at half-past 8 o'clock.

Mr. DISRAELI has permitted himself to be
MIr. DISRAELI has permitted himself to be made an example for the benefit of that rather numerous class who concentrate their generaUy small stock of talents on detecting imaginary inconsistencies. It is quite enough that two things may be of a contrary tendency, as far as they gothat is, they may take you for the time in different directions, and these critics insist on committing you absolutely to one or the other, and then saddling you with a self-contradiction. Discretion, if it means anything at all, and if there be such a thing, means rendering due weight to a variety of obligations and circumstances. No sooner, however, is this done than a shrill petulant cry arises from some quarter or other, " Oh, you're inconsistent; " you were doing that, and now you're doing this ;" or, " You are doing this and that at the same " time." In the present instance it required some forcing of facts, some twisting of terms, and concoction of circumstances, to place the " this" and the " that" of Mr. DiSRA&ELI's indictment Ti the desired antagonism. The " this" was, that England and France had pursued a policy with the King of SA-RDThIA that might possibly flatter his hopes of some territorial or political advantage over his neighbours in Italy; and a policy with the King of N,APLES that might possibly lead to a movement among his own subjects, and consequently those of the other absolute States in the Peninsula. The tendency of our measures in these quarters might be considered in the liberal direction. We availed ourselves of a valuable assistance from a liberal monarch, and we withdrew our diplomatic countenance from an absolutist one. Supposing these measures to be one policy, they constitute one limb of the professed contradiction. Now for the other limb, the " that' with which Mr. DISBIUi came down upon Government the other night. The real fact of the case, as known at the time, and as it must have been tak-en for granted by everybody who gave a moment's thought to the matter, was simply as follows :-Italy being still in a rather feverish state at the commencement of the Russian war, France having a garrison in Rome, and Austria having recently been obliged to increase hers in Lombardy, it was obvious that any alteration would disturb the balancebetween those two Powers. When Austria, therefore, was invited to take the field with us against Russia, and would in so doing run the double risk of being obliged to withdraw her forces from Italy and having to put down insurrection excited by Russia, it was necessary she should have an understanding from France that, pending the war, the latter Power would not profit by these contingencies to increase her present interest in the Peninsula. The thing thought of was simply a military convention indispensable between belligerents. As it happens, the thing thought of was not done. Austria never took the field with us. The convention was never signed, for there was no need of it. Had it been signed, however, with the fullest cogni zance and participation of the British Government, it only amounted to the very natural understanding that when the Western Powers were putting Austria in the van of a most perilous war, in which she was certain to be severely handled, they were not themselves at the same time to set upon her rear, and so utterly incapacitate her from fighting their battle. It was this militaryconvention, absolutely necessary under the circumstances of the case, to be in force during those circumstances, and only thought of, not done, that MIr. D1sxAELr constructed into a dishonest contradiction with the long standing policy of England in the Italian Peninsula.
It is a matter of little importance how, when, or where the temporary convention that was proposed to be made, but never made at al, was converted into a treaty, made and still in force. These inventive processes are generally inscrutable, and, after all, not worth investigation. Lord PALMERSON humanely took the view that the article was of Parisian manufacture, and that MIr. DISBAELI had merely performed the part of importer. That gentleman, however, afirms that he is not indebted to Paris for the supposed treaty. He leaves us still in the dark as to his own share in it. If he is accused, or thinks he is accused, of a wilful fabricaion, he very properly resents such an attack on his veracity and honour. If, on the other hand, he is let off with the less dishonourable though less important character of dupe. he appears still more indignant at a tone of remark so little commensurate with the gravity of the offence. One of these parts, however, he must now close with.
Have his foreign informants given him a correct. version of the affair ? Has he the documents, the correspondence, or whatever it is, that bears the date of December 22, 1854 ? If he has, if his French or Austrian friends have not deceived him, then he may disclaim the doubtful honour of what we must call a work of imagination. " A fiction founded upon fact" we can scarcely call it, for, as the convention was never made, there can hardly be said to have been a fact at all in any sense of that word. Indeed, there is no more fact than the broad, notorious fact, that England and France invited to their aid against Russia both Austria and Sardinia, two Powers recently at war, and in a mutual antagonism both as to territorial ambition and political tendencies. Of course, when we asked them to co-operate with us and with one another, it was on the understanding that we should not disturb, or permit anybody else to disturb, the 5atuts 9tw between the allies diuing the war. There never was a European war in which some such understanding was not necesary, but it was never supposed to bar the allies from any future prosecution of their separate policies when the war was over.
The charge has probably its real origin in the old and almost disused workshop of domestic faction. A few years ago England was deafened with perpetual cries of " Treachery," " Inconsistency," "Base "surrender," and the like, issuing from committeerooms, public meetings, and provincial societies, and delivered home by strong country lungs across the floor of the House of Commons. Compacts were al!eged which were supposed to bind the soul of the unfortunate subscriber to all eternity, and that at the interpretation of the faction which im-
posed them. WVe need not go back further into those unhappy times, except to observo that compliance w -with the code of those days would have plunged I the country into the greatest disasters, and that 'oi
subsequent prosperity, as3 wel 3s our ingft exemption from the evils of a great Europeatz crisis, is owing to the so-caeIed inconsisten6y, of some very great men. On those par. tioular questions the delusion has been dispelled and truth has triumpned; but we regret to observe that the manufactory of such charges is kept at work. The hands, we presume, must be employed. It is a vested interest, a branch of domestic industry; and, if it is not very profitable, must on that aceount be protected. As we don't like the article at all-as we think fictitious and gratuitous charges of incolsistency and dishonesty a bad fashion, happily exploded, fit only for the most bilious cla53 of politicians, we are not sorry that summary justice has been done one th utterer or coiner, it does not matter which, in this instance; and we trust the offence Will not soon bo repeated.

A great deal was said in the House of Commons
A great deal was said in the House of Commons on Monday night about the importance of the question of secondary punishments submitted to Parliament by Sir G. GCxx. We trust the House will not by its acts contradict its own professions, and disappoint the country by an inadequate and inefficacious measure. There is, however, some reason to fear that theory and sentiment may carry the day against practical wisdom, common sense, and universal experience, and that a precious opportunity of redressing a great grievance may be lost to the country for ever.
far as we are yet able to comprehend the project of the Government, it is deficient in one essential element. It exacts no discrimination in the characters of the criminals tried, and demands no discrimination in the nature of the punishments imposed. This is the great omission of our criminal code; it punishes the evil deed without any reference to the history and habits of the evildoer. It imposes upon men and youths the most dissimilar in their lives, education, and character, exactly the same routine of punishment and the same liability to impure contact; and thus it arms those whom we must continue to call the sentimental philanthropists with the means of doing a grave social wrong, by comprehending within the same lenity the callous and incorrigible no less than the casual and corrigible breakers of the law.
We do not as yet see that Sir G. GRy's scheme will professedly supply this defect. Perhaps, by leaving a certain amount of discretion to the judges in passing sentence on criminals, it may indirectly, and in a certain degree, effect this end. But we maintain that this cannot be done so as to satisfy the requirements and insure the safety of society until a wider definition be given to crime. Hitherto English procedure has erred on the side of leniency. Jealously tenacious of the matter of indictments and of the evidence strictly bearing on their proof, it has sternly rejected all testimony as to the character of the accused, save that which was of a favourable nature. Thus, in many instances, where no previous conviction could be proved, men whose whole life had been passed in the furtherance of crimes in which they had the cunning to avoid an ostensible participation have escaped with no worse a sentence than alighted on the unhardened and unslilful offender. We hope it will not be deemed too wide a departure from the better principles of English law to receive and demand evidence of the lives and associates of those who are convicted before our criminal tribunals.
At least, if this be not done, the admissions of speakers in Monday evening's debate make out a bad case for the country. According to them, transportation on a large scale is impossible. Western Australia cannot take more than about 200 a-year. The area of Gibraltar and Bermuda is still more limited. Penal servitude will henceforth be the chief secondary punishment in force. This will be inflicted for the most part in England. A very small minority of convicts will endure its hardships abroad. Such is the declaration of Sir G. GRzy, and the House assents to it. But this is not all. The predominant opinion expressedeven if it be not the predominant opinion entertained-in the House is, that such portion of penal servitude as may involve the accessories of transportation should be reserved for, not the worst, but the corrigible, class of criminals. It is argued that we have no right to throw out our moral filth on our colonies, &c. We need not state at length what has now become a rhetorical commonplace. But has Parliament well weighed the purport of this argument, and considered the prospect which its admission reveals to us ? We do not contest-nay, we have ever proclaimed-the reformatory benefits of transportation. We know as well as any member of either House that convicts who have neither the hope nor the chance of reforming at home will reform in a colony. But we also maintain that convicts who cannot reform, will not reform, who jeer and scoff at anynotion of reformation, are less dangerous and less detrimental in a colony than they are in England. We never recommended that the two classes-the corrigible and the incorrigible -should be sent to the same colony, placed under the same regulations, subjected to the same labour, and treated in the same way, with the same hope and chance of liberation. This was never our plan. While we have continued to cherish the hope that we might find some colony not unwilling to receive and to utilize those prisoners whom ignorance, weak-ness, or want had extemporized into criminals, we have ever givea the first place to the necessity of removing frora the field of their past successes those who were criminal by choice, preference, and deliberation. And nothing that has been said in the House of Commons has shaken our conviction of this necessity. Whatever be done with the milder class of offenders, neither life nor property is safe so long as the most obdurate assailants of both remain in this country, in the constant presence of pillage such as no colony can display. Even those members who disavowv our inference admit our premise, and declare that a bad criminal is as dangerous as the worst lunatic, and ought to be shut up, to keep him out of harm's way. But how is this to be done if he remains in England ? What guarantee have we that a sentence of perpetual imprisonment would be honestly carried into execution? Have we not seen sufficient of late to justify the suspicion that interest, hypocrisy, credulity, and sentimental philanthropy, would, either separately or collectively, neutralize the judicial decree, and make the edict of the law an empty jest? We do not believe that any atrocious criminal would be detained for twenty years in confinement at home. The visiting magistrates, or the chaplain, or the county member, or the Peace Society, or the Society of Friends, or the Band of Hope, or some other body, recognized or unrecognized, would interfere to terminate an imprisonment so adverse to the sanitury or sesthetic conditions of the victim. We say nothing of the chances of escape whijh long experience and practised astuteness mighfliscover for one who had qualified himself for a heavy sentence.
Again, it is contended that perpetual imprisonmnent need not imply perpetual confinement, but only that degree of restraint and vi-ilance
consistent with laborious occutpation. If by this it is meant-as, indeed, some members avowed-. that the worst criuminals should be set to publie
vorks in gangs, then, we asl;, what becomes of the rhetorical denunciatiois so ofteni launchedl Kai ,
fthis gang-,work in the colonies ? Do the people 'who talk thus know what is the language and 'what are the communications made by the 'more hardened of these convict labourers to eaoh other? Do they know, or can they, after the volumes of evidence already published, help knowmiug, that the more experieuivid reveal to their less knowing and Younger fellows the thousand dodges
al tricks of crime? All this occurs irn a colony. True; but mark with what different results and mnder what diiferent circumntanceg. Tlere, whatever the chances of escape may be, even to the -worst convict, his prospect of returning to England -s slight indeed. England is generally the last .place to which he would wish to return, and certainly it is the very last when he has been sentenced vo a long exile; and, as for their younger asson1ltes, these have other chances in a colony fairer and more promising than a life of crime. But, were the perpetual penal servitude to be inflicted in England, with the chances which we have stated of legal remission or illegal escape, in a few years the 'country would be at the mercy of men whose guilty experience, while it made them too wary to betray themselves again, made them the best instructors to all who wished to follow the paths -of crime. No penal serAtude in England could 'ever involve perpetual imprisonment, and its nomi-
lial infliction would practically retain in the country the most eminent teachers and models of ruffianism. When people talk of the horrors of
Australia, we would beg to ask them if they - ever thought what England, with a tithe of -the Australian area, must become when infested 'by its detected and incorrigible felonry, increasing in numbers and ramifying in its connexions year by year?
We conclude by repeating the hope that we 'have often before expressed,-that, even if they be unable to find a colony for the reception and reformation of onr more docile and corrigible convicts -an inability which, with the FaLldands open to 'us, we altogether deny-at any rate our rulers should take some steps to rid us of men who constitute a perpetual source of terror and an unceasing incitement to crime. We cannot see why the two objects should clash; but we have -no hesitation in asserting which is the more urgent of the two.

The sword has slain its hecatombs-so has the
The sword has slain its hecatombs-so has the 'lancet-but we doubt if these may not be equalled in number by the pale cohorts of the needle who are now flitting hither and thither in the twilight of the silent world. It is a terrible incident of our social existence that the resources for gaining a livelihood left open to women are so few. Struggle as they will-with the exception of those who may be employed in factories-it is with them, stitch-stitch--stitch. From gray morning to dusky eve, and far on, too, into the cheerless night, the poor seamstress plies her allotted task, too thankful if she can save herself from pollu-tion and from pinching hunger by her incessant -and monotonous toil. To be sure, there are thousands upon thousands of poor women throughout the country who have taken upon themselves the office of wife and mother without much prospect of being able to find raiment, shelter, and food for themselves and for the miserable creatures whom they may bring inLto the world; but what could they do ? The alternative -was a cadetship in the army of the needle. At any rate they secured a claim to the support of *a man's strong arm, although too often that arm
is raised against them by the drunken, blaspheming beast, who had sworn to protect them from all harm. Were there reasonable prospect of a livelihood in any other way it is probable that an illconditioned brute would find some little difficulty in procuring a wife, and thus, at any rate, the annual contribution to the mass of misery would be diminished in quantity. At present, -the language practically held by modern society to destitute women may be resolved into "Marry-Stitch-Die--or Do worse P" The first command implies well-nigh incessant toil -the angnish without the joys of maternity-too -often submission to the drunken freaks of a ruffian, and patient toleration of his violence. The second means toil stiUl more incessant, ungladdened by any ray of human sympathy-toil for sixteen hours of each day, carried out in some chill attic,-it means the hectic flush, the hard, dry cough, and, at last, despair. The third alternative we will reveoentially pass over, for it is not for us to say what compensation may be reserved elsewhere for the poor creatures who have drawn so sad a number in the lottery of life. Of the fourtlh command it is enough to add that it is too commonly obeyed, as is known to all men who frequent the thoroughfares of our great towns at certainhoursof thenight. It is, indeed, obeyed so well that all vestige of the Divine stamp is at length obliterated from the medal which was intended to be worn next the heart of one, and only one, but which has been too roughly and too frequently passed from hand to hand. The resources then open to women are few indeed, and at the head of these stanids the NEEDLE. A public meeting has just been held at Exeter-haU which gives us the -opportunity of saying a few words upon the subject.
The object of this meeting was to consider what is caled the " oppressed condition of the milliners " and dressmakers." We entirely agree with the Bishop of Loipo?N, who moved the first resolution, when he said that he was glad it was a moderate one, not denouncing any class. In the majority of cases we most entirely believe that if the inmmediate employers had any voice in the matter they would leave no stone unturned to procure a fairer and more equable distribution of their work. Theirs, however, is a peculiar business. They must draw their anLual basket of fish out of a stream which is at one moment a torrent, at another little better than that torrent's bed. Suzrely, if the miDliners and dressmakers of London could divide the annual average of their work by twelve, and perform a twelfth part in each month of the twelve, they would be the first to rejoice at such a conclusion. Their own profits would be greater, at the same time that they could give higher rates of remaneration to the young persons in their employment. We cannot indeed ignore the fact that there are among the employers a certain niunber of LEGtEES, both male and female, who wor!; their gangs of white slaves in a manner which would have satisfied even that type of the finished slavedriver. But with these we ,cannot deal. All the master or mistress can ~do is t) make such arrangements at the commencement of the season as may enable them to meet the occasional period of stress which will infalibly come upon them during its continuance without over-taxing the strength of the employed. Upon this subject we have long since said that -absolute legislation would be preposterous. We have serious doubts as to the practical advantage to be dei!ed even from those combinatioas of ladies who 'have resolved themselves into associations for refusing their custom to all houses in which the rule of limited hours for labour is not strictly observed. The inquiries will be evaded, and the work probably be performed, not beneath the roof of the employer but under enforced conditions of unceasing toil, as heretofore. If the head of a millinery or dressmaling establishment chooses to act harshly to the young persons in her employment, she cau readily enough baffle all inrestigation; if she
be otherwise disposed, investigation is superfluous. The ladies of England can, however, contribute largely to the progress of the good cause. Let them, in the frst place, religiously and regularly pay their debts, so that the employers of labour, knowing the exact state of their resources, and knowing that these resources are available in their business, may be able to nake good and sufficient arrangements in the labour-market. How frequently are the conductors of second and third-class houses driven to the use of the sorew simply because they have not funds forthcoming to coinduct their business in a liberal and tradesmanolike manner-these funds being held, as it were, in mortmain by their customers, who do not, and will not, pay their debts I Again, 'we would entreat of all ladies during the impending season " to give their orders i
" time." If they would but reflect for a moment upon the vast amount of misery which their thoughtlessness inflicts upon their poor labouring sisters, we are confident they would use a little foresight upon so capital a matter. Surely the dates of weddings, QtUmN's balls, fetes, Court presentations, &c., are not matters quite beyond the reach of human prescience ? Surely there is no necessity, save in very exceptional cases, for insisting upon the delivery of goods to-morrow which have been ordered but to-day ?
If, then, we doubt the wisdom of many of the remedies which have been proposed for the relief of this unfortunate class of persons, it is not because we do not sympathize keenly with their sufferings. Their case is the case of labourers in an overstocked market, who are entirely at the mercy of their employers. The only real way to secure their permanent benefit is to promote aU measures which might have a tendency to alter the relative conditions under which the employers are at the present moment acting, and the employed enduring. First in importance of these would be any measure which would give to the employed means of escape from the intolerable evils of their condition. We know that our friends of the Political Economy Club would tell us that any void created by occasional depletion of the labour-market would soon be filled up; but it is no spasmodic effort which we contemplate, but the erection, as it were, of a bridge over which many of these poor creatures might take their flight; and not only benefit themselves, but indescribably ameliorate the condition of those whom they had left at home. There is in the Cauadas a region where thousands of women might be absorbed and become happy wives and mothers, while here they have before them no prospect but that of incessant labour and premature death. There is here no question of a passage to the Australias-a more tedious and a more exTiensive passage-although we earnestly trust, as time wears on and facilities of communication increase, that English misery in the case of these poor seamstresses may be largely converted into Australian happiness. The Canadas do, however, present a loophole of escape for many of them, and we would very earnestly press the point upon the consideration of all benevolent persons who sympathize with their distress. We can have little doubt that if the conditions of the transit were made easy and secure in a very few years a sensible effect would be produced upon the female labour-market in England. This, however, cannot be done in a day, and meanwhile we wish every success to the exertions of the Bishops of LoNDox and LLAWDAVF, of the Earl of SHAFTESBURY, and of the other gentlemen who met the other night in Exeter-hall, although their conclusions may on some points be different from our own. The measures they advocate can certainly do no harm-we very sincerely hope they may produce more good than we can venture to anticipate.

In the report of the proceedings of the Manchester
In the report of the proceedings of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, which we publish this morning, we observe with great satisfaction not only the earnestness with which the question of our cotton supplies is treated, but the practical shape which the arguments are at length assuming. Of our own part in this matter, and of the obligations which the President of the Chamber was pleased to express in respect of our intervention, we say nothing, for on a subject so eminently popular and urgent it was impossible for a public journal to mistake its path of duty. The interests at stake are not merely those of Manchester, but those of the British ompire, though it is, of course, to be expected that the classes most intimately and immediately concerned in the great cotton manufactures of the country should take the lead in insuring those supplies on which so much depends. The few words which we shall now add upon the question will be very plain.
We are relyinsg for oiur supply of cotton almost exclusively upon the United States. To such a condition of commerce there may not be much objection in the abstract, for the quality of the article obtained from that quarter can hardly be surpassed, the energy and skill of the Americans in maintaining and increasing the amount produced are unimpeachable, while as to any effect of the monopoly in raising prices Mr. BAZLSY was fain to admlit that the Manchester consumers had occasionally been too hard upon the producers across the Atlantic, and paid them insufficiently for their work. The anxiety with which the present state of things is regarded arises entirely from the accidental features which the trade has assumed, and which, in reality, have alarmed the Americans as well as ourselves. So enormous has the consumption of cotton become, and so widely is it extending, that the total demands of the world are not unlikely to exceed the total produce ; nor does it appear that the Southern States of America, on which five-sixths of the whole burden is at present thrown, cau expect to increase their production at the rate required. Moreover, by this limitation of the supply to a single field it is exposed at one and the same moment to all the risks and contingencies which may affect a crop or a harvest in any one given country. Our eggs are all in one basket, and those eggs are very precious indeed. If America could always send us exactly as much cotton as we wanted, there would be nothing further to desire, for her staple is the very best, and the wellestablished intercourse between the two countries has resulted in unequalled facilities of commerce. But even in the best of years it is as much as the supply can do to meet the demand; we live from hand to mouth, and Mr. BAzI,BY reasonably conceives that he is giving us a welcome and encouraging assurance when he tells us that, after all, perhaps we may manage to square things this year, and even find ourselves at Christmas next "in " a position not exactly one of perfect exhaustion." We are very glad to hear it, and to learn on such good authority that we are safe, at any rate, for 1857 ; but it is plainly desirable to escape from such unpleasant straits by extending our cotton markets as soon as we can. We can take all that America sends us and a good deal more besides.
Now, what difficulty ought to lie in our way in this matter, when, as Mr. BAZLEY pointedly coadensed the facts, the British dominions actuaUly comprise a greater extent of territories adapted to the growth of cotton than is possessed by any 01er Power in X} wQ1d ? In thli 4eNs
it is surely permissible to may that we can do what we like with our own. Naturally, at this minutethe United States, both from intrinsic advantages and practised cultivation, produce an article of first-rate quality, nor is it likely that Surat cotton should fully equal the best Sea Island sorts. But the exports from Surat do not represent the possible production of all Iadia-scarcely, per-
sps, of all Bombay. India comprise3 infinite varieties of ciimate and soil, and we are already told that at Darjeelng, at the foot of the Himalayas, the real Sea Island cotton can be favourably grown. Besides, there are other kinds of excellent seed. A correspondent observed yesterday that cotton of a famous staple used to be produced in the Seychelles Islands, and a letter read by Mr. BAZnXY to the Manchester Chamber communicated the fact that this identical seed (the Bourbon seed) answered well in India. Why, then, since India possesses inexhaustible resources of soil and labour, is cotton not duly grown ? Inferior the quality certainly may be to some extent, but this inferiority, as is admitted on al sides, can be in a great degree removed by improved seed, improved machinery, and improved means of transport. Now, there is not one of these beneficial agencies which is not absolutely at our command. Seeds of all kinds we can procure with ease, and the correspondents of the Manchester Chamber expressly urge that they should be sent out. Machinery we can never be deficient in, and as railway communication is now opened in every presidency of India, and each section of each line, imperfect though they are, more than pays its expenses, we do not see what impediments can stand in the way of success.

THE EARL OF HAREWOOD.-The medical bulletins
THE EAnI OF EIATEwooD.-The medical bulletins from Harewood-house have within the la8t few days been of a more cheering character, and sanguine hopes are now en tertained that the noble Earl will recover from the severe accident that befell him on the 24th ult. The bulletin yesterday was as follows:-
The Earl of lisrewoot is going on faourably.-Harewood-houez Tuesday Morning, Feb. 10."1
STABBING iN; SELF-DnErxcE.-On Monday last a young man of genteel appearance and respectably connected, named John P. Waterston, was placed at the bar of the High Court, Edinburgh, charged with culpable homicide and assault, in so far as on the morning of the 1st of Jannary, about 2 o'clockr he assaulted John Christie, a labourer, and stabbed him with a knife in the chest, in consequence of wbich he immediately expired ; as asatbbed =Mari
Garrett in the sboulder, to the danger of his life; as also Patrick Smithin the face and arm, and Patrick Murray in the thigh, to the serious injury of their persons. The panel pleaded "Not Guilty."1 It appeared from the evidence that a party of Irish labourers, bent on frolic or unischiefs wore nass1.,g down the E,rthen Mound, which unites the old ind new towns, and were near the'National Gallery, when they set on the prisoner, 'who was coming up, and asked him forwhiskytokeep NewYearesmorning or moneytogetit. The lad was laid hold of and thrown down,as theappearance of his clothing proved, and in a state either of alarm, or probably exasperation, and in the apprehension of being garotted and robbed, he drew out a pretty large pocket knife and strack Garrett, Smith, and Murray with it, and was making his escape, when Christie pursnued him, on which Waters-on turned round and stabbed him near the heart. The unfortunate man Christie, unknown to Waterston, who ran away, died almost on the spot. Waterston at once told the story of his encounter to several friends and also to one of the police-constables he passed on his way bome, ana the same day he was apprehended. After the preliminary in. quiry he was liberated on bail, until he appeared at cotrt to take his trial. After the full disclosure of the facts of the case, and it being evident that the knife was used in self-defence, and after very favourable evidence as to clhiracter had been tendered, the Solicitor-General withdrew the charges, and the jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty amid the cheers of a crowded court.
M;TBOPOLITANr IMPROVEMENTS.-No advance was made out of the consolidated fund last year to the Commigsioners of Public Works, but 144,8531. was paid into the Consolidated fusid, leaving a balance of 430,928. due to the said fond on the 314t of Deegmber, 1856,

The Belgian Transitthstlc Royal Mail Company's m. ship Constitution, Captain Pougin, baa arrived off Cowes, on her way to Antwerp, and brings advices one day later thau those received, vi4 Liverpool, per Emea. This steamer left New York On the 25th uIt., at 2.30 p.m. Sho "oald not leave on the previous day, as Intended, having had 26 hours' hard work in cutting and passing through the ice12 and 20 inches thiok-to get to the small lane of clear water left on the Jersey shore of the river. After that they found fields of ice for 30 mniles out of the bay. They had ane weather tho whole page, but repeated easterly winds.
The ConstitUtion brought 61 passengers, 17 of whom were for Southampton. The captain received a complimentary address from the passengers, congratulating him on this the first trip of the Constitution, and expressing their satisfiction and high appreciation of the worth and ability of Captain Pougin and his officers, and their endeavours to promote the general comfort of all on board.
The news by the Persia, from Liverpool, received at New York on the 24th, checked sales in cotton, which were confined to a few hundred bales, the market closing quiet and rather unsettled. Flour was inactive, and with moderate males, closing at easier rates for common State and Western brand.a There were no transactions of sufficient magnitude after the receipt of the Persia's news to show its effect upon the market for breadstuffs. Wheat was firm before the nevs, with sales of common Sonthern white afloat, at $1 68c. to $1 70e-; and choice ditto, with Missouri, at $1 82ce Corn was unchanged, while ssles of Western mixed were made at 72c. in storo at the Atlantic Docks, and 75c. from store in the city. Pork was firm, with sales of new mass at $21, and old at $19 874c. to $20, closing at the latter figure. Sugars were firm, with moderate sales of hogshead aLt full prices. Coffee was steady, with limited sales of Rio, as dealers were disposed to await the advent of the auction sale advertised for the 27th inst. Freights were unchanged, while engagements were to a moderate extent. Cotton was engaged for Liverpool at id,, and some lots for a steamer at 7-16d. Flour was unchanged, and grain nominal at 7d. to 7,d. The interference from ice still prevented the de. livery of grain on shipboard. The question was mooted on 'Change how far the Atlantic Dock Company were liable to storers of grain, &c., provided a want of due diligence in keeping open the communication on their part could be shown. The European advices and tbe large exportation of specie from New York had a bad effect on the stockmarket, and at the close the tendency of prices was downward.
The President had approved the bill compelling witnesses to testify before Congressional committees, and it is now the law of the land. In the House of Representatives, Mr. Chester, a correspondent of a Philadelphia paper, was brought to the bar, when a resolution was adopted, calling on the witness to furnish excuses why he should not appear before the select committec, andit was also determined that he should answer in writing under oath. Nothing further was done in the case. The Senate transacted no business of i nportance.
The steamship Atlantic, from Liverpool, after reaching her dock was discovered to be leaking. It is supposed that she was cut through by the ice. The pumps had been constantly at work, by which she was kept perfectly free from water. The leak was on the bow, about 2ft. below the water-mark, The cargo was being rapidly discharged, and the goods had not received the lighiest damage.
The mail made up at Cincinnati on the 19th uIt. for New York city was partially consumed, while on the cars, at Batavia, on the morning of the 22d. Seven bundles of letters, much charred, were arranged and re-enveloped at the post-office.
The steamship James Adger arrived at New York on the 24th from Sau Juan, Nicaragua. The advices from Walker's head-quarters were to the 29th of December, and consisted mainly of details of operations previous to that date. Walker's position was good. He had 1,200 men and plenty of munitions and supplies of provisions. 300 F1ibusters occupied Purta Arenas. The Costa Ricans stiUl held position of the San Juan river, but they had made no attempt to follow up their partal success. This fact may be regarded as the most important point of the intelligence.

The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Colombo, Captain J. S. Field, arrived to-day, with dates from Alexandria, January 20th; Malta, 24th; Gibraltar, 30th; and Vigo, February 7th. On the outward passage, shortly after leaving England, one of the fans of the screw broke, and after some heavy weather experienced between Malta and Gibraltar, during which one of the lifeboats was washed overboard, snother fan gave way, the voyage homcward thence being accomplished with one fan, After leaving Gibraltar she experienced a succession of head gales and heavy seas from the north and east, which obliged the Colombo to put into Vigo, where the mails were landed in charge of Lieutenant 3Iorris, theAdmiralty agent, for the purpose of being forwarded home by the Peninsular steamer Madrid, due there on the 10th. This was done to insure the deliveryof the mail inEngland bythe 5th, incase the Colombo xhouald meet with head winds, or lose the remaining portion of her screw. From Vigo, wh ich port she left on the 7th nst., the Colombo had favourable winds, and at one time she was running 12 and 13 knots for some hours.
This steamer brings 68 passengers, of whom 32 are firstclass; snd on freight, specie value 8521., and a cargo consisting of 187 boxes of oranges, 47 packages of dates, 882 bales of silk, four packages of elephants' teeth, four ditto of wool, 173 ditto of gum, and 175 ditto of sundries.

Apprehension Of A Notorious Criminal.
ArrBHEPsIOX OF A NOTORIOUS C BN1MA. -The convict George Holmes, respecting whose discharge from pron and free pardon by the Secretary of State so Jmuch excitement was recently occuioned in the West Riding and surprise expressed throughout the country, Is again in custody at Bradford. Holmes has been a thief nearly bis life; h-i earlier and generally most successful efforts were robbceries of the farmers' henroosts; he gradually became more daring in his exploits, was titme after tirae convicted, and, afteruAiergoing various periods of incarceration, was suspected of being the rmurderer of Mrs. M'Knight, at Illdey, but the circumstances of that unfortunate case being enveloped in mystery the capital charge was dlsmissedhe was, however, convicted at the next York Assizes, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, for the perpetration of a criminal assault on the person of a young girl in the immediate neighbourhood of tlhe supposed murder. It was from the term of imprisonment consequent on this conviction that he was released by Sir George Grey, on the representation that the prisoner was in " a delicate state of health.' , e has once more resumed his former vicious course, and, together with a man named Jesse Smith, is in the custody of thbeBradford police on a chlrge of stealing a qaantity of fowls. On Monday they were broughtbeforethe borough magistrates at Bradford Court-house. Mr.Leverett (the chief constable) informed the bench that the two prisoners had been apprehended on suspicion of stealing a large number of fowls found in their possesSion, and of which they were unable to give any satisfactory account. One of the prisoners was George Holmes, weboe careerwas nost notorious; and the other, Jesse Smith, bore a very indifferent character The police-officers, however, had gone a considerable distance in search of the owners of the fowls, and he therefore asked for a remand until Wednesday. The prsoners were accordingly remanded. We are informed that Holmes has undergone Pn examination by a medical man, who has certified that he is at present in perfect health.

The mailship of the 20th of Augus arrived in 77 days; that of the 5th of September, out 69 days, hu not yet arrived.
The Ministy of New Souttr Wales are all duly Seated Mr. Donaldson, the Secretary of 3Finance, *So, -ras rejectod by his former constituents, having ebtained a seat by the resignation of a partisan. People alb getting tfred of a session which has produced no fruits ec%pt Ministerial defeats and changes and the mutual recrimifitbions of parties This is in favour of the present Ministry, -whihh will probably pass only a few essential measures, ana then either carry a long adjournment or prorogue.
This system of adjourmments is cArried to an extent in AU these colonies unknown in the Parliamentary practice of the mother country. I think the fashion wa set in Van Diemen's Land, when, in October, 1852, the Council voted only three months' supply, in order to give time to Her Majesty to send an answer to the anti-transportation ad(resses. The Council was then adjourned until December. In this colony the Government has always oontrived to be behindhand. The Council, which, for tho convenience of the country members especially ought to be called together in June, and might then be pro. rogued before the hot weather, has seldom been called to. gether before November. The consequence in that members get tired out before they have done half their work, and a ix weeks' adjournment, in December and January has been favourably received. In New South Wales,when the Donaldson Ministry was formed, they asked for and obtained an adjournment of aix weeks to prepare their statement of their policy. The Cowper Ministry intended to pursue the same course, bub was snuffed out before it came to tlhat. The Parker Ministry hardly requirqs as much time for the same purpose, because it inherits the Donaldson portfolios, so that to secure the same object advantage will probably be taken of the fact that people both " in and out of doors" are tired of the session.
Our Legislature is called together for the 21st of Novem. ber, and the report is that the Ministers wil lay the estimates on the table with a lot of " useful practical bills," and will then propose a long adjournment " for the hot season." If the House will kindly pass the, estimates a holyday till April is the bribe held out.
In Van Diemen's Land the old officials connected with the transportation system are to remain in power, and not only not to be opposed, but to be joined and countenanced and supported by two of their firmest opponents-T. D. Chapman, member for Hobart Town, a merchant, and the " HumE" of that colony, and Eenry Anstey, a country gentleman, and a brother of Chisholm Anstey. I do not think this coalition will act favourably on the public character of the above-named gentleman. They, or at least one of them, Mr. T. D. Chapman, was looked upon as the leader of the Opposition to Sir William Denison's Government and the principles upon which it was condacted. 'Mr. Champ was the person who took office to support transportation when the late secretary went out of office on that question. These elements can hardly unite so as to work smoothly, or, if they do, it wil probably be by a sacrifice of principle, and of public character. This, however, must be added. -that there wiU be no want of ability in the first Tasmanian Ministry. 3Ir. Champ has good administrative capacity, and has been trained to office. Smitb, the AttorneyGeneral, is altogether a superior man, and T. D. Chapman has excellent ability, a good stock of useful informationwell posted up, the Yankees call it-and has great energy.
In this colony there is a very great difference of opinion as to the result of the elections, so far as the strength of the Ministry is concerned. I believe they will not have a majority at their command; but by a judicious introduction of "good measures" they may have majority after majority, which wil look like permaneft strength, and may grow into actual strength by securing the waverers-a large class here, w'here, to say the trath, political morality is not very high. Out of 57 members returned I count only 18 decided ministerialists, and son:e of them must vote against Mioisters on one or two ques. tions. There are 13 men of doubtful politics, many of whom wil on most occasions vote with Ministers, and there are 26 more or less opposed to Government. But, after all, it is very difficult to make any caloulation, beeause oe one or two questions the bMnistry will have the support of one or two of their most decided opponents, e.g., on the question of State aid to religious sects, O'Shaunessy will vote with them, dragging in his train all the Catholic mem. bers; but then Fellows, their own Solicitor-General, will vote with the Opposition on that question. There are other questions on which the Oppositior is divided and are likely to remain so. True, the Ministry entertain different opinions also, but they are less scrupulous, and although they differ, and it is said now and then quarrel over their differences, they will not permit their differences to affect their votes. Though there be no uniformity of principle there is perfect uniformity of voting.
The Agiua newspaper, now a marked supporter of the Government, is doing all it can to check and prevent anything like organization by the Opposition. If any three or four men who have usually acted together, and wvho may happen not to be agreed on some one subject, are supposed to be taking any step towards party organization they are denounced, and party itself is condemned; but nothing is said of the same sort of organization by the Government party. The Argus a short time since actually put forth this theory,-that the public ought to look onlyto administrative capacityin themembers of the Ministry. An instance was given of a public officer who is at the head of the penal establishments, but not a member of either House, and his administrative capacity being universaly granted the question was asked, " What has the public to do with his opinions ?" The inference intended was, " What have the public to do with the opinions of Ministers 5." But I believe aI this is seen through. At alU events it has not prevented some meetings of " an Opposition." In short it is absurd to deprecate party under a Parliamentary Ministry and in a representative Leislature. Party is inevitable. There is sure to be one set of men in favour of rapid progress, another set of men more favourable to the continuance of things as they are. It is quite imnaterial by what names they may be called. Indeed the first effect of our new form of government is to create parties. They exist, but we have not yet named them. Probably they wil give themselves eulogistic names; but they will, like parties elsewhere, give each other dislogistic nicknames, and most likely the latter will stick.
Our civic election of Mayor took place on Monday the 10th, the hallowed 9th of November faUling on Sunday. The late Mayor, John Thomas Smitb, was a Whittingtop, and something more, for he had filled the chair four times, but without a Bow beU to foretell it. John Thomas, as he is familiarly called, would have served again; but his popularity has declined of late, and so the aldermen and Common Council have elected one Peter Davis, a successful auctioneer, in his place. This John Thomas is a remarkable man in his way, and is quite a creation of Australian society. He could scarcely have grown out of iny other colonial community. He commnenced as the keeper of a low publichouse--not, perhape, worse than others, for all, in the early days of the colony, were disreputable dens of infamy. Trade prospered with him, and he became very wealthy. He then left off keeping a publichouse, but became an extensive owner of publichouse property, and this gives him a good deal of influence of a certain Idnd. His first introduction into public life was in the City Council, and he proved himself a very useful and active member. He wasthen elected a member of the Legislature for the city, butbhe did not shine in his new position. Lately some of his family have been connected with rather a disgraceful scramble for the effects of a dead insolvent; but I really believe John Thomas had nothing to do with the matter. However, it damaged his popularity, and he lost his election for the Upper House. The Argus had mado him the object of a series of very severe attacks; but there is a rude sense of fair play in the public, and these very attacks created a reaction In his favour, so that vhen, after his
defeat for the Upper House, he proposed himself as a candidate for the city, he was elected. This colony has been often quizzed for letting publicans into the House, but there is nothing so very absurd in the thing after al They are often men not destitute of education. They have energy and sagacity, and are certainly better qualified for a good deal of public business than many a noble lord or honourable gentleman. As for this same John Thomas, he has made himself an excellent magistrate, devotes his whole time to public business, and does it weL Then there is a good deal of genial kind-heartedness about the man, and he is generous with his ample means,. This is always a quality which secures popularity ; and so it ought. On the whole, his good and useful qualities far outweigh all others; and all the stories against him are many years old. Hence, though John Thomas has been under a cloud, he will most certainly come into the ascendant again if his ambition do not lead him into waters beyond his depth.
This has been a very remarl,able season. The weather has continued cool, and even cold, and rain has fallen in abund.
ance. The country is consequently green. last year the
season was siniilar, but not so cold. The consequence wa& that the grass never lost its verdure, and vegetables were, as they are now, very abundant. I have generally observed that a protracted and wet spring is foUowed by a cool and n;oist summer, an d, as Mr. To9kq gb$eaed, ssegvel season
of liko chxracter uoceed each other. It s a e
matter to us to haye our hot winds modera'-. I believo efrorts are making throughout the interiC'r t7 beep up the water which falls in winter so. & io pravent its immedixte flow into the ea. This, f extensidly put into practice as population and 8tock increase, wi tend to moderate the summer heats. Agriculturehas been greatly extondedthisyear and the Crops look welL Our gardens have, however, suffered by twopests-a small insect, anaphis,Ibelieve, which has Attacked the cabbage tribe, and a green beetle, which covers
aimas, roses, fruit trees, and other shrubs, and strips everything baro. But these insects are large, and can be swept away, or carriod off in a barrowt, a hole, killed with boiling water, and buried. But I have known insects in thesa colonies-the grub, which attackr barley, for instance-so znumerous as to be piled up in the cerner of a field liker drifted sand, and on dying to poise. the air with their stench. They seemed to march in one direction, and on meeting with the obstruction of a bank or a close fence to, smother each other.
Of the sound and flourishing state of trade there cannot be any doubt. Although shipments from England to thesa colonies have increased and are increasing, I seo no fear of overtrading, because our exports keep wel a-head of our imports to the extent of rather over 2,030,O0. sterling, and our gold is rather on the increase on account of the favourable state of the weather. The last week's supply by escort was 61,775 ounces, and for the year 2,256,175 ouncee,. The quantity exported to tho 8th of November is 2,488,248 ounces, value 9,952,9721.
It is clear that accumulation has been going on beyonl ihe means of investment, as the rate of interest has declined and the prices of all money securities have risen. Our Government Five per Cent. debentures are at 101, and Six per Cests. at 108X. Houses everywhere and land in good situations have risen in price without a corresponding advance of rent, thus indicating the same feature of a faU in the rate of interest. This is against the small capitalist fronm England, who used to be attracted by the prospect of 15 or 20 per cent.; but it shows that accumulation has followeed industry with great rapidity, for it is unquestionsble that two years ago scarcely any enterprise could be undertareza with any certain security against loss. Wages have risen. Most of the mechanics connected with building,-masons, carpenters, painters, plasterers, after having reduced their working hours from 10 to 8, have lately succeeded in raising their wages from about 14s. to 1Bs. a-day, and that, too upon mere request, without anything like a strike; and, while their money wages are thus high, the necessaries or life are moderate.
On Saturday night and Sunday we were visited by a very heavy gale from the north and north-north-west, which dic
a good deal of damage to smaU craft In the bay. It unroofed several houses at Wilriamstown, carried away a church at Emerald-hiU (South Melbourne), damaged a new church at St. Kl]da, and tore the shrabs out of the ground in our gardens. They have a wind gauge at the Electric Telegraph-office, which was rendered useless. The force of the wind was said to be 401b. to the square inch. The barometer was 29 30 near the level of the sea.

Crime In The Metropolis.
CRIME IrN THE METROPOLIS.
The rev. John Davis, the Ordinary of Newgate, has just presented to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen his report for the year 1856 npon the condition of the prisoD and the state of crime in the metropolis.
Upon the subject of the ticket-of-le.ve system the Ordinary says:-
"In the present year many ticket-of-leave men have %ppeareaI among sThose proved in open oourt to have been at liberty on ticketa of leave from their exemplary conduct in prion have had their names transmitted to Government. The calculations made public aro bared on these ret uns, aud it is attempted to be showv by sucs means what the proportion is between the liberated convicts who, reform and those who fall again into crime. I grestly doubt the accaracyof such returns as underrating what tho facts of tho case are. On one occasion during the past yeari when we had I8 men in Newgate under sentence of transportation or penal servitude, thes governor took the trouble to inquire, from rumours among the police, from conversations among the prisoners themselve, from the of lcers who were constantly with them, and various other sonroes of Information, how many out of the 48 might be ticket-of-leave men and he had reasonabie proof that somewhere about 20 were so. If
more than one-third of that number could be reported to the Government under the preaent regulations, . .. As a general rule, the ticlet-of-leave Fystem faUs with men of babitual crime, and should
everheapplied tothem, except in rare instances of exemlary demeanour. Thereis noting so much dreaded by habitual t Heves as perpetual imprisonment, and to lessen such a sentence therel nothins they would nothave recourse to "
With regard to the garotte robberies the Ordinary says,-
" 1 have often thought, and stil think, that the origin of garotta robberies took place from the exhibition of the way the Thngs in Isdiw strangle and plunder passengers, ma exhibited in the Iritisbh Museum. Rowerervaluabloas illustrations of Indian manners such representationamaybe, Iconld heartily wish that there models were plaoedin some
GIore obscure poton, and cease to be that which I fe3- they hive been, themean of giving to men addictedto crimeandNiolenceBa idea how their evil purposes may b accomplished.'
With regard to the case of Corrigan, who murdered him wife, the Ordinary says:-
"Nothingeouldboe more oxemplary than the conduct of Thomas
Oorrisan while i Newgate. lie spent much time in devotional exerciss, ad sezed with Svidity the promises or Heaven to true

The next case reFerred to is that of Wiriame Bousfield who waS executed for the murder of his wife aud four chfidren.
The Ordinary says:-
The beeettinvg sin of William Bonshield was au inveterate habit of idleness, lls family and himself, in fact, were sunpyonted by the labour of his wife anud the asaletasice or her friends.Il sole occupaUon ws to take sperumerary charactes at differnt theatre, where roldiers cc ome such pertonages had in ppear, bur not to speak. Ia all my experience amn Og so many thovssads of criminals r nevrer saw such an instance of the power of idleness prostrating ill the manly feelings of our nature."
The nexct cases of murder to 'which the Ordinary refers are those of Mary Anne Hurns, for the murder of her two children by' drownuing them in the canal at tTxbridge, an& Celestina hommers for cutting the throat of her child; xnd he states that the cause of both these crimes appeared to be the 'waist of means to provide for the support of the children a nd he adds that there is hardly a crsme that brings offenAers to Nowgate that does not sometimes arise from ther pressuro of 'want; and that 'while the street thief, the burglar, and the highwvay robber pleads this us his excuse, it occasionaliy urges the greatest culiprits to commit the foulest crimes._

City Commission Of Sewers.
I CITY COMM/ISSION OF SEVBRS.
Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of publie business; Mr. Deputy Peacock occupied the chair.
SANITARY STATE OF THE CITY.
Dr. LErsTEnY (tho Medical Officer of Health) presented a report which showed a considerable increase in the proportion of deaths as compared with those of the Last few weeks, the total number of deaths for the week being 70, of which 19 were among young children, and 18 old persons of 60 and. upwards. It exhibited a comparative high mortality among persons in the prime of life. The chief causes of death were
iseases of the respiratory organs, especially bronchitis which had, doubtless, to be attributed to the cold of the previous ten days.

Dr. LETHEIY presented his yearly report of the illuminating power and chymical quality of the gas supplied to
the Clty by the Great Central Gas Consumers Company, from whiCh it appeared that its power of light during the firt quarer was equal to that of 13.25 sperm candles, or 15.15 wax' during the second to 12.75 sperm, orl4.6 wax; during the tmird to 12.5 sperm, or 14.3 wax; and during the fourthi to 12.9 sperm. or 14.75 waax, the yearly average being 12.85 sperm, or 14.7 wax. This is nearly 23 per cent. over the standard illuminating power required by the act of Parliament. The gas was examined at the London Hospital and. at Coleman-street, 242 e.xperiments having been made. The chymical quality of the gas was also remarkably good during the first nmne months of the year, but during the last three. it contained a notable proportion of sulphuretted hydrogen. and an excess of ammonia.
The COURT, after lining several of the contractors for cleansing the streets for neglect of duty (the penalties iix one case amounting to the sum of 56.), adjourned.

Mit. JORN M'GBsEGoR, M.P. FO GLAsGOW.-
A few weeks ago a portion of the electors of the secondL muntcipal ward of Glasgow held a meeting in reference to the position in which the city, and they themselves especially as former supporters of Mr. John hi'Gregor, wereplaced by certain disclosures affecting that gentleman in connexion. with the Royal British Bank. After conference, a letter, couched in a very friendly spirit, was addressed to him, of which the following is a copy:-
"23, hCoetsith.rowr, Glasgowr, Dec. 51.
X Dear Slr,-At a meeting of L feW of your sBupporters of the aeoes& municipal ward, held last evenlig, for the yre of discussing the

in a haat nowe written by you some time ago you promised to give an explanation of your share in thes cecurrencee. WVe think.

"'Ou are rware that the electors of the secoud ward hare lwaya. given you a genrows and hearty eunport, and wo do u^t think it untit or uncourtooua in them to ask sslc explanations or course as above indicated.

Means were taken to ascertain that this letter had reachedl lsr. M'Gregor's hands; but, though fully five weeks have elapsed since it was transmitted, he has not vouchsafe& any reply. A second meeting of electors of the second ward -vas accordingly held on yriday night last, when Mr. M'Gregor's silence was considered quite unsatisfactory by all,
andit was the impression of those present that the tinX, had come when it was their duty to repudiate or disowm, him as a member for Glasgow. Beforecalling ageoDs2

PARIS, MONDAY, Fum. 9, 6 P.M.
While the Ottoman Government was adopting measures for the establishment of a railroad to connect the Danube with the Mediterranean, and while Austria was doubting wvhether it suited her interests to open a communication with Turkey by Wallachia or by Servia, the Wallachian Government, fearing that it would be completely zet aside in this great uidertakkiDg, decided on sending its Minister of Finance to Paris and London in order to form an Austro-Anglo-French Company, with the view of commencing a railroad between its frontiers of Transylvania and Rustchuk, and thus obtaining a priority in its favour. The Wallachian Ilinister of Finance does not appear to have as yet succeeded with the French capitalists, who hesitate at embarking in the undertaking, in consequence, as they allege, of their Government persisting in its idea of the union of the Principalities, and which they apprehernd would necessarily, and for a long period, keep up a state of agitation and trouble in a country which, in the opinion of those who are well acquainted with it, is hardly prepared for the fatal gift.
The interests of the Turkish railroad appearing essentially connected with those of the line projected by the Wallachian Government, it is probable that its Mlinister of Finance will proceed forthwith to London, in order to make the definitive arrangements which he considers vill be for the advantage of his country.
The tradesmen and manufacturers of Paris are still complaining. The daily consumption of the city is merely sufficient to give employment to a certain number of hands, and to enable the shopkeepers to keep their houses open. Speculation is at a stand in consequence of the high price of the raw materials, and the same cause has paralyzed the export trade. The accounts from Alsace and the manufacturing towns in Normandy are not more encouraging; they represent a general otagnation of trade among the spinners, and a consequent reduction of hands in the mills. The millowners find that, in order to effect sales, they must reduce their prices below the cost of production. The accounts from Lyons, however, are less discouraging. The manufacturers of that city have received large orders from the U nited States, and a good quantity of superior silks and velvets has found a ready market in Paris from persons who are not deterred by high prices from purchasing, and it must not be forgotten that we are now in the season of balls and soirees. No further movement, however, is expected until the suring sets in, when it is hoped that a demand for lighter stuffs will arise. The Russians and Germans still purchase articles of Parisian manufacture, such as jewelry and gilt bronze ornaments, and the wealthy Boyards of the Principalities are acquiriug a taste for French produce. The com mercial relations between France and the Ottoman Empire have considerably increased since the peace, and a large portion of the gold exported during that period has found its wvay back, and paid for French goods.
There is more activity observable at the French Eeaports. Colonial produce, such as sugar, coffee, and cocoa, is in good demand. The high price of cotton, however, deters speculators. The constant demand for wheat fromii the southern departmeats of France, Spain, and Portugal keeps up the price, notwithstanding the abundant harvest in the north of France, and the immense arrivals at Marseilles from Southern Russia, amounting to 4,000,000 hectolitres. At the last Paris market flour of the first quality was quoted at 80f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. There is a struggle going on between the millers and the bakers ; the former endeavour to raise prices by limiting their production, but the latter, who do not anticipate any rise, merely purchase sufficient to supply their customers from day to day. The reserve of flour in the market stores isreduced to 6,000 metrical quintals. The heavy fall of snow in several depaitments has prevented the farmers from bringing thei corn to market, and there has been a general rise of prices in the country towns. The last letters from Odessa state that, in consequence of the low price of freights, wheat has been shipped there, to be delivered at Marseilles, at from 21f. to 23f. the hectolitre. The freight from Odessa to Marseilles is lf. 50c. the measure of 100 litres. There has been a considerable demand for wine at Bercy durina the last 14 days, both for Paris and the suburl. Prices remain firm, without any rise. It is calculated that it will require three good vintages to reduce the price of win-e to what it was five years since. There is not much doing in the wine trade at Bordeaux. A public sale took place there a few days since of several cases of wine returned from India, but the greater portion was withdrawn for want of buyers. Business is more active at Pezenas, at Narbonne, and at Beziers, where the best quality of red wine is sold at 350f. to 400f. the cask of 700 litres. Spirits of wine distilled from beetroot are dull in Paris, at 124f. the hectolitre.
The A nnales dzc Cwnumcrce Extdriefsr say,-
" The wine nerchants of Paris are now purchasing large quantities of ivine in Arrigon. At Carmena 5,000 barrels have just been botught at 30f. the 115 litres, the same quantity having been before sold at 18f. and 20f. The wines of that part of Arragon are this year very strong and very rich in colour. in consequence of the present state of cemnmunication in Spain the wines of Arragon-which ought to be brought by waggon from Saragossa to St. Sebastia, there cieibarked for Bayonne, and thence conveyed to Paris by railway-are sent by the Ebro to Aiiiposta, thence by land to Alfaques, there shipped, and afterwards reachh Paris by Tarascon and the Mediterraneans Railway. loivoever incredible this may appear, thera is a saving of S2f. a-tun in making this long round by theEbro and thehMediterranean. The carriage of a tun of wine costs froisi Saragossa to St. Sebastian, by the present roads, 150,f.; from St. Sebastian to Bordeaux by se", 20f. ; and by rail fronm Bordeaux to Paris, o7f.-total 207f.; wisile by the Ebro it only costs 40f from Saragossa to Amposta, 20f. from Amnosta to Cette, and52f.1from Cette to Paris, snaking, with 13f. for sundry expenses, 125f. The former route, notwithstanding the extra expense, is often obliged to be resorted to from the present insufficiency of boats on the Ebro. In spite of all these difiiculties of transport, business to the amount of more that 10,000,000f. has been this year done in this part of Spain in the two articles of wine and wooL"
A letter from St. Petersburg, of the 31st ult., states that the affairs of Persia appear to assume a serious appearance. Several generals who command the troops stationed on the frontiers of Russia and Persia, on the coast of the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, have been summoned to St. Petersburg, to attend a council of war. Several couriers have been despatched to Count Perofliki at Orenburg, to the Caucasus, and to General Prince Orbeliau, who commands on the Caspian Sea. General Kappher, chief of the staff of the rlght wing of the line of the Caucasus, and the chief of the staff of the corps detached from Siberia, have left to resume their commands, having received instructions for every eventuality which may arise. The writer then denies that there is any truth in the assertions of some of the Austrian newspapers, that the Russian Government is occupied in re-establishing its military ports in the Black Sea, or rebuilding the towns of Kertch and Sebastopol, or raising the ships of war sunk in the harbour. On the contrary, according to the writer, the Russian Government is gradually reducing its military establishments in the Crimea, and the denomination "RussianFleet in the Black Sea" is erased from the Isn?eril AlAnanac, and replaced by "Flotilla of the Black Sea." Acdmiral Zebrilcoff, appointed to the command of that flotilla, left St. Petersburg on the 30th ult. for Nicholalef.
Another letter from St. Petersburg, of the 1st inst., says:-
"A considerable amount of discussion has taken place during the last few days between the Minister of Foreign Affairs aud the Englisls Legation on three important questions:-the recall of the English fleet from the Blaok Sea, the evacuation of Greece, and the Anglo-Persian difficulty. Lord Wodehouse, who displayed much more moderation in these negotiations than was expected, announced to Prince (ortochakoff that the English fleet will have evacuated the internal waters of Turkey by the penod fixed by the protocol of the 6th of Jannary, ut is to say the 30th of March, This declaration was made without any reserve, so that it is not posible to doubt that it wil be sted on. Prince Gortschakoff declared, in hi3 turn. that Russia was ready to admit English Consuls into the BLck Sea. Lord Wodehouse ii, no doubt, convinced that Russia is occupied with other things than shemes of con uest and territorial aggrandizement, and that aleeoonssderst a development of her internal resoures as the most urgent of her existing duties. He has communicated that conviction to his Government."

CONSTATI=OPLE, JAwx. 30.
It is just a earisince the Sultan sined the Lo attillungayoun which abolished in principle the difference between the ruling and sbject classes, and declared themi equal in al respects. With all general principles, it is easy enough to 8nounce them, bIt not quite so easy to endow them with life. The only attempt which the late Ministry made In the question of the enlistment of non-Mahomedansfailed, and ended with leaving the kharadj rather larger than before, and only changing its name into that of military subvention. Nor ought any one who knows the history of this document to be surprised at this. It did not emanate from any conviction on the part of the Sultan or the (iovernment, as was the case with the Hafti-Scheriff of Gulhane. It was dictated by the representatives of the great European Powers at the prelimBinary conferences. The negotiations for peace bad begun, and it was of the highest importance that Turkey herself should give such assurances about the future position of the non-Mahomedans in the Ottoman empire as would preclude the necessity of any foreign protectorate. The programme which the great Powers deemed satisfactory was laid before the Turkish Government, and the latter had nothing to do but to clothe it in the least objectionable form.
As the late Ministry after its first failure gave up the idea of immortalizing itself by solving the difficult problem of making the ruling and subject classes forget the history of centuries, it devolved on the present Grand Vizier to undertake the remodelling of the empire on the principles laid down in the Hatti-Humayoun.
These principles are not new. All the reforms attempted hitherto were in that direction. The aim was to abolish the distinction between the ruling and subject classes, and to establish a government based on the principles of justice and equity. Thus P.edschid Pasha, who first laid dowrn these principles in the Hatti-Scheriff of Gulhane, has now once more a chance of carrying out the reforms which he has been hitherto prevented from introducing. He loses no time in doing this. The questions of immediate necessity have scarcely been satisfactorily settled, when he turns his attention to the subject. He does this in a manner which shows that he is one of the few men who, after a life passed in the pursuit of an object, has the freedom of spirit to inv&stigate how far he has succeeded, and the courage to begin anew, should he find that he has been mistaken. He sees that the system of administrationwhich he himself originated has notbrought forth the fruits which were anticipated. He sees that many, if not most, of the laws enacted have remained a dead letter, or have only been imperfectly executed. Yet one must not attribute to him this failure, for he never was allowed to carry out his ideas of reform. A short time after the publication of the Hatti-ScherifF of Gulhane,vwhen he attempted to give life to the principles enounced in that document, he was forced to retire before the opposition which he encoimtered everywhere, and to ask to be sent abroad.
After a few years' residence as Ambassador in Paris he was again sent for, and intrusted with the organization of the administration. He laid down the bases, and a commission worked out the details, but he was forced to abandon many essential points and try to make a compromise between the still powerful influence of old ideas and his own views. Thus his work remained incomplete and very soon degenerated. But, even had he been allowed full liberty, could it be expected that something perfect should be produced in the first instance? We must remember that the new system is not 14 years old, and that it was introduced after a violent crisis, which had shaken the empire to its very foundations: how was it possible, under these circumstances, to change an Oriental despotism into an European monarchy all at once, and to eradicate a deep-seated svstem of favouritism and corruption? Purity of administration is even in Europe of recent origin, and not 50 years ago all that we cry out against in Turkey was openly practised in all European Governments; nay, we have not far to seek at the present moment to find analogies to the state of things here. So we must not be too hard on the Turks, especially when we see that a great effort is being made to remedy what is wvrong. lYhat Redschid Pasha contemplates is a thorough revision of the whole system of governument, Four conferences have taken place, in which all the members, active and passive, of the present Ministry have taken part; and it has been resolved that a comrmission shall be formed of six members and a president, who are to study the existing state of things, and to propose a plan by which the present abuses can be corrected, and the principles laid down in the Hatti-Scheriff of Gulhan6, the regulations of the tanzimat, and the late Hatti-Humayoun can be best realized. No programme is put before them, and they are left entirely at liberty, guided only by the spirit which pervades the abovenamed documents. The first subject which they are to take into consideration is the administration of the provinces, which must, of course, contain the basis of aU reforms. Their work is to be divided into six sections, according as it has reference to political, financial, judicial, military, or educational affairs, and to the administration of public works in the province. The members who are to compose this commuission are not yet named, but it i intended to have members of the different departments, in order to take advantage of;their special knowledge in the different branches of administration.
When the Commission has elaborated its plan of provincial administration, it will be first introduced into one province as an experiment, and if it is found to answer, then the whole provincial administration will be reformed on that model. The province in which the experiment will most likely be tried is either Broussa or Adrianople, as being nearest, and therefore most easily superintended. To speak in praise of this measure seems to me superfluous. Every one is convinced of the necessity of a thorough revision of the system of government and administration in Turkey; the question is only who will have the coiurage to undertake it? for it must needs affect powerful private interests, and will create not a few enemies to him wvho carries it out, but if successful it promises to merit for him who undertook it the name of a regenerator of his country.
The Austrian, Russian, and Prussian Plenipotentiaries are to leave this city to-day for Vienna.
I told you some time ago that the Turkish Government was preparing a division of troops to go
to tne Prmcipalitfes when the Austrians have ev-
cuated them. The original intention was to send F even battalions to Moldavia and eight to Wallachia; this has now been altered to four and five battalions to each of the two provinces respectively. But even to this number it seems there will be objections made, as according to the spirit of the treaty, the MoldoWVallachians are to be left entirely free in the expression of their wishes, and the presence of an army of occupation, even if it be composed of Turks, might be considered as a moral coercion. The sending of Turkish troops would be, undoubtedly, a step in a false direction, for it would imply distrust. The Danube is close to Bucharest, and Brailow or Ismail not so very far from Jassy; so, even if what can scarcely be supposed should happen, and disturbances take place, Turkish troops might be brought up in a day or two. But even the supposition of disturbances seems absurd, for the wildest enthusiasts would scarcely be foolish enough to themselves destroy the chances of a reorganization of their country.

It is not positively known when their MaJesties will leave Mlan, but the three Ministes are likely to be in Vienna again on or about the 18th of this month. On the 1st the Emperor and the Archduke
Ferdinand Max, his brother, drove out to the railroad to meet thes King of Bavaria, who appeared to be delighted to see his Imperial relatives in such excellent health and spirits. After having saluted each other in the continental fashion, the three Princes drove back together to the city. Directly after his arrival at the Palace the King paid his respects to Her Majesty the Empress, who, as you will probably recollect, is a scion of the ducal branch of the house of Bavaria. Although the Emperor generally presides at the Ministerial conferences which are daily held, he finds time to show the " lions" of Milan to his Royal guest, and to paes some hours in his com pany in the - evening. On the day of the Kings arrival there was a grand concert given in his honour, at which no fewer than 1,500 persons were present. In the morning of the 2d the Emperor and the King examined some new brass instruments made by Peliti of Milan, for military bands, and then took a walk together through the streets of the city. In the evening their Majesties went to the Scala, where they heard Verdi's Trovatore, which bas been so often repeated that the Milanese are almost inclined to fancy that some of the simgers have learnt nothing else. Although the enthusiasm which took possession of the Milanese on the 25th of January has subsided, their Majesties are received with extreme respect whenever they appear in public. It has struck me that, since the state of public feeling has improved in Lombardy, the semiofficial writers for the press have ceased to give such a ridiculously high colouring to their reports.
It is stated that the instalation of the Archduke Perdinand Max as Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom will take place on the 12th instant, but no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the statement.. Baron Biurger has managed matters well since he has been in Milan, but it has been resolved that an Italian shall in future hold the office of Stadtholder of Lombardy, and you may therefore soon expect to hear that he (Baron Burger) has succeeded Baron Krauss as Minister of Justice. At first there was an idea of making Count Sebregondi, who is now Podesta of Milan, Stadtholder of Lombardy, but the choice of His Majesty is likely to fall on Coumt d'Archinto. Of this last-mentioned gentleman r know nothin, more than that he is one of the leaders of the Ultramontane party.
The sudden arrival of Count Rudolph Appony from London has caused some little sensation in diplomatic circles, as it is believed that he would not have undertaken a journey to Vienna at this season of the year if he had not received a summons from his Government. The political quidnuncs of this city aflinn that the friendly relations between England and Austria are about to become "still more intimate," but there is no reason to believe that there is any question of a separate treaty of alliance between the two Powers. lor the moment, England and Austria want each other's services, and it stands to reason that they will hold together without any special convention, as long as the interests of the two nations require that they should. do so. An attentive observer cannot but notice that the Russian party in Austria is in a state of dissolution. A few months since the leaders of the Vienna aristocracywould have considered it a kind of l9se-majestM to be on a friendly footing with the representative of Great Britain, but now they are extremely desirous to cultivate his acquaintance, and affect to turn their backs on Baron Budberg. As the Viennese are passionately fond of amusement, it is possible that one of the causes of the popularity of Sir Hamilton Seymour is that he gives fine baUs and good suppers, while the Russian Minister gives neither the one nor the other. It is to be sipposed that Lady Seymour is also on excellent ternms with the high and mighty of the land, for complaints have been made in my presence that the Princesses Lichtenstein and Schwarzenberg intend to give their baUs on a week-day instead of Sunday, "for the convenience of the puritanical English."
Although the statutes for the organization of the army are not yet published, a part of their contents is alreadv known to the privileged few. The chief of the Military Central Chancellerie is to have a seat in the Cabinet, and in case of his illness or absence from the capital his substitute. There are four kinds of Imperial Royal body-guards,the Arciere Guard, which is composed of officers; the Trabant Guard, which consists of non-commissioned officers; and the Gendarmerie and Palace Guards. The infantry consists of 62 regiments of the line, 14 frontier infantry regiments, and one frontier battalion. The infantry regiments, when on a peace footing, are to have four battalions of six companies each, and -when on a war footing a depSt battalion of four companies is to be formed. WNrhen on a peace footing each infantry regiment is to consist of 2,830 men, and when on a war footing of 6,886 men and 76 horses. The Chasseurs consist of one regiment, composed of seven battalions and one depot battalion, and 25 separate battalions. The " sanitary" troops are composed of 14 separate companies. The heavy cavalry consists of eight Cuirassier and eight Dragoon regiments; the light cavalry of 12 Hussar and 12 Lancer regiments. The heavy cavalry regiments have six, the light regiments eight squadrons. The field artillery is composed of 12 regiments, of one coast regiment, and of one rocket regiment. When on a peace footing an artillery regiment has four batteries of 6, three batteries of 12 pounders, five horse batteries with eight guns, and three companies. WNhen on a war footing each regiment has a sixth horse battery and an extra battery of long howitzers. The rocket regiment has 18 batteries in time of peace and 20 in time of war. The engineers consist of 12 separate battalions, of four companies each. Three-fourths of the men are to be sappers, and the remamnder regular miners. The pioneers have six separate battalions, each of four companies, and the necessary pontoon trains. The "flotilla corps"consists of three separate squadrons; the one for the Danube, the second for the Venetian lagunes, and the third for the inland seas. The baggage train corps is composed of 24 transport squadrons. waith 12 dep6ts for the men and nine for the waggons, &c. The Emperor is Commander-in-Chief, and it is the business of the litary Central Chancellerie to e-xecute hiis orders, but the highest military authority (Bcherde) is the Supreme Army Commando.

BERLIN, FEB. S.
In the total impossibility of learning anything here of the approaching Neuchatel Conferences, or of the conditious likely to be made by the King, it is satisfactory to learn from the French, and more particularly from the Swiss press, the rapid progress that is being made in the negotiations carried on in Paris by the representatives of Switzeiland and the Prussian embassy, through the intermediation of Count Walewski; but as, on the other band, it is known here positively that the Prussian Minister, Count Hatzfeldt, has been confined to his bed for some time past, and the Secretary to the Prussian Legation in Paris has been for as long staying here in Berlin, it is difficult to conceive in what way these negotiations can have been carried on with the said Embassy. The energy, too, with which the Swiss Government is represented by the organs of the Swiss press as constantly rejecting a number of postulates assumed to be put forward by the zxi oT i _rusi as- -ircl less1 enttle to a&mira-
Kig Of Prulssia iS hardly les-s entitled to nadmration than the valour -with which Don Quixote ran tilt at the windmills. In spite of all the exactness
of detail put forwvard about the time and place of
the conferences, and the particulars of the King's demands, you may rest assured that not a sing'e iota of all there statements is trule. There have been no negotiations at all on the subject with any representative of Prussia anywhere, and every point connected with the affairissttll an open question here. The French Government (and that Government alone) isendeavouringtoarnge the prehminariesfor negotiations to be opened between Shitzerland and Prussia, and it will depend upon the nature of the overtures made by the former whether the French Government will communicate thent or not to the latter, with a view to the resumption, first of all, of diplomatic relations. As yet nothing of the kind has been forwarded, hither - from Paris, as I am assured, and, judging from what I know and hear, I should think it likely to be some time before any-
thing satisfactory does arrive from there. At pre-
rent it is totally undecided here who is to go to the conferences (Colonel. von Manteuffel and lIerr von Bismarok Sch5nhausen are the two diplomatists between whom th choie lies)-where the conferences are to be held, though ParIs seems to have the best chance-or whether there are to be
any conferences at allz it is equally unsettled, whether diDlomatio relations shall be resumed with SwdizeRrlan , and whether Dr. Kern shall be received here, in case of his coming to Berlin previous
to their resunption; the decision on every point i3 left in abeyance until it is actually presented for deliberation by the mediating party, the French Government.
As regards the views entertained here with reference to the final solution of the causa litis, I have already informed you that there are many most respected and influential persons just now about the Kig anxious to prevail upon him to renounce every vestige of claim to sovereignty, protectorate, patronage, property, &c.-everything and anything, in short, that could at any future time bring Prussia into collision with the Swiss Federal Government, and thus embroil the State in its relations with the rest of Europe. This enlightened advice they give in the interest of the State, whieh has no advantage or benefit, but on the contrary finds a source of weakness, in the Principality of Neuch&tel. The Ministers are equally urgent with the King that heshould arrange for the cession of all his claims on everything in NeuchAtel; but as men in offiice, and more or less responsible to public opinion for the discharge of their duties, they bargain for his obtaining an indemnification for what he cedesif not for the sovereignty, at least for the domains, and that he shall take measures to protect the Royalist party in Neuchatel by judicial securities after the actial separation of the Principality from its Prince. The King, however, thinks and feels very differently from both these parties, and to the views of the latter he is diametrically opposed. It is always possible, he is aware, that circumstances may make it inexpedient for him to retain the sovereignty of NeuehAtel, but, at any rate, he Ecouts the idea of an indemnification for it, more particularly a pecuniary one, and it is difficult to see what other indemnification the Swiss Government can offer him. In the mere fact of the population of Neuchatel having shaken off their allegianee to him in 1848 the King sees nothing approaching to a verdict of public law, which should induce him on that account to resign his claims to the Principality, which he and his ancestors have held for 150 years. In the fact that the Swiss nation has since then adopted a fresh constitution, which assumes to itself a full and undivided sovereignty over Nenchatel, the King fitds nothing prejudieial to his claims; for it was with another Government, and under another constitution, that of 1815, that the late King consented to admit the Swiss Government to share with him in the administration of the Principality; on the contrary, the renunciation by the Swiss of their constitution of 1815, the basis of the arrangement made with Prussia, does in fact, in the opinion of men versed in public law, vitiate the claim which the Swiss Government mitht stil put forward to the share of the administration accorded it by the late King at the Congress of Vienna. These views, which are of no recent date at the Court of Prussia, have received every eonfirmation and corroboration by the signatures of the four great Powers of Europe, assembled in conference in London in May, 1852, which, although subsequent te the promulgation of the new constitution the Swiss had given themselves, recognized the sovereignty of Neuchatel as still resident in the King of P'russia, in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty of Vienna, in 1815. On the other hand, the King does not shut his eyes to the fact that this divided sovereignty or government in fNeuchOtel is a fruitful source of conflict with the Swiss Government ; nor to the fact, that the manner in which, in spite of his own mere personal relationship to Neuchael as its Prince, the Prussian State has to a great e.xtent become identified with its King, a state of things which is productive of evil to the Prussian State without any accompanying benefit to it. Conscious as he is of these two evils in the hitherto existing relations, you will find his exertions, should conferences ever come to be held, directed towards removing those evils, but not towards making a cession of bis sovereignty. Thislatter result may, it is true, by force of eircumstances, become almost compulsory upon him. lVhenever this contingency should supervene he will, of course, when needs must, submit to it, but as long as his present conviction and determinationhold good that ceesion will never be in favour of Switzerland.

STATB OF TRADE.
MANCHESTER, FEB. 10.
There bas been rather more aotivity in the yarn-market, and in some kinds of twist wo may quote Ed. advance on last Tuesday's quctations. The principal buyers have been the German and Russian houses, and there has been some little doing for India. Cop yarns are also in good request, without change in prices so far as lower counts are concerned, but the finer cops, from 70's upwards, are fully Ad. per lb dearer, owiDg to the extra demand recently made for kEgyptian and Brazl'ian cotton. In cloths beyond a better ee.ing there is nothing to remark. There has been very little business doing in fabrics suited to either the home or foreign markets. In India and China shirtings thera is now some accunmulation of stocks, more particularly in 61b. and 71b. goods. Prices have declined in these goods during the last four weeks from 4.id. to Gd. per piece, which leaves a heavy loss on their production at the present rates for the raw material.
Messrs. John Slagg andko. report:-

The lace trade has improved to a slight extent, still in many branches business is dull. For Canada and the continental mnrtkets there is a fair amount of business transactions, and operations for our home trade are also extending. Brown nets continue exceedingly dear. There are orders for goods 'or America, and upon the whole the lace trade is in a healthy state. In silks and fancy goods there is not much doir.g, in consequence of the high Price of materia. The hosiery trade continues very brisk-, the demand awhich we bave experienced for several weeks past being in no way diminisbed. The stocks on hand being very loex, the pre. sent demand renders the market very busy.
LEICESTER, FEB. 10.
Trade, more especially as respects w orsted and woolle
goods, contir.ues dull. There is a tolerable inquiiry for c:otton articles; a good deal of machinery is, however, stil unemployed. The price of wools and yarns has become serious, 3nd entirely precludes any increase of stocks.
LEEDS, FEBs. 10.
The woollen cloth-market has been very firm in both cloth-halls this morning. Meltons, ladies' cloths, and other fabrics for the spring trade are in brisk request, and the supply is scarcely equal to the demand. MIanufacturers are usy, and they are not disposed to sell except at an advance on last month's prices.
The report of the Huddersfield market to-day is as fol-
"The market is a very fair one. There is an average attendance of buyers, and inquiries for summer goods have commenced among shipping houses writh considerable briskness. The usual sales are cheap fancdes, cotton warps, &c.
Both in raw material and the manufactulred article stocks are low. In w,ools prices are still advancing."

The arrivals from Ireland and coastwise eines Tuesday are liberalof oats, oatmeal, and flour, but light of other artles. From foreign psrts there have been reported 14,107 quarters of wbeat, 6,023 quarters of Indian corn, and 19,755 barrels of flour; and from Canada 675 quarters of wheat and 1,100 barrels of flour. The exports are on a liberal scale and comprise 5,39 quarters of wheat, 1,192 quarter. of barley, 3MU quarters of oats, 14,878 quarters of Indian corn, 1,213 Facks and L062 barrels of flour. Theweather is now mild and dimp. Our trade has been exceedingly dnll during the week for wheat a rd four, the demand having been quite in retall for immediate consump. tion.

Tuesday Evening.
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is 25 17j per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 3l 17s. 101d. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 6. 10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Jlamburg the price of gold is 422 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13-3j per IL. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about the same value in the two markets.
The expectation of a favourable financial statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Fsiday next, coupled with the recent gold arrivals and the general tendency to improvement in the continental exchanges, have caused the English funds to show considerable firmness to-day, in the face of an urgent demand for money to complete the psymentsfor the bullion just purchased for France. Consols for money opened at the closing price of last evening-92; to 93, and soon advaned to 93 to i, at which they remained with great steadiness to the termination of business. For the 5th of Mlarch the last transactions were at 934 to
Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217j; Reduced,93J toi; New Three per Cents., 9SW to ; dia
to 220; Exchequer-honds, 9 to ; Ildia-bonds, 2s. discount to is. premium; and Exchequer-hills, p ar to Ss. premium.
In the Stock Exchange to-day 64 per cent. was paid for short loans on Giovernnent securities and in the discount-market as well as at the Bank of England the demand was very active.
Foreign securities showed no important alteration, but prices were well supported. In Turkish Six per Cents. for the account, transactions took place at 93k, i and 93. The bargains in Venezuela, for the account, occurred at 37k- Danish Three per Cents., 84 and 85; Ecuador New Consolidated 14fl - New Grenada Active, 22X; Greek, 6 ; Mexican Three per Cents., for the account, 214; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44k; Sardinian Five per Cents., 90i and 90; Spanish Certificates of Coupon, 6 and a.; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 9Si; andDutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents.,
in the foreign exchanges this afternoon thero was an advance in the rates upon Amsterdam and f3 amburg. Paris was likewise a shade higher.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 15c. for money, and 68f. 35c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration beyond a slight abatement in the pressure for money.
The gold by the Morning Light was delivered today. A'bout 0,0001. was sold to the Bank, and a further sum is expected to be taken there to-morrow.
The African mail steamer Et-hiope to-day has brought 8,7001. in gold.
The New York packet overdue this week is the America, from Boston, whence she should have sailed on the 28th of January. She is presumed to have been detained in Boston harbour by the ice. Meanwhile accounts have been received by the Constitution from New York to the 23d. The frost, which had continued with uninterrupted severity for more than three weeks, showed no signs of abatement. In the stock-market there had been a fair amount of business without anx material change in prices. Erie Railway was still quoted 62j, New York Central 94, and IllinoisCentral 127. Reading bad declined to 824 to 83, and Panama had advanced to 95.
The MonitetLr of yesterday contains the annual report of the Bank of France. It appears that the total operations for the year amounted to 232,360,0001. against 194,520,0001. in 1855. The discounts for 1856 were 150,480,0001., exceeding those of 1855 by 36,4801. The note circulation reached its highest point in July, when it stood at 26,680,0001. It has since been reduced to 24,600,0001. The mninimum of bullion held was on the 16th of October, the total having then fallen to 6,360,0001. against a note circulation of 24,7C0,0001. During the year the purchases of gold amounted to 20,344,0001., on which the premium paid was 1249,992L. In addition, silver was boug t to the
extent of 2,040,0001., making the aggregate of specie purchases 22,633,9921. No losses of iniportance were experienccd from failures.
The half-yearly meetings of the several joint stock banks in London being now completed, the subjoined table has been made up, exhibiting their relative capitals and extent of transactions, as well the respective periods at which they were opened. Within the half-year there has been an increase of 268,4511. in the deposits Qf the London and Westminster Bank, and of 157,8941 in those of the City Bank. In the other cases there has been a faUling off,-namely, 64:9,4261. in the deposits of the London Joint-Stock Bank; 669,9141. in those of the London and County; 107,2171. in those of the Bank of London. The Union and Commercial banks do not publish any detailed accounts at this period, and their present deposits therefore cannot be stated. At Midsummer last the total held by the Union was 9,045,6061., and by the Commercial 1,536,3611. In the six months the private deposits at the Bank of England have increased from 9,810,0451. to 10,132,6651 During the same time the failure has occurred of the Royal British Bank, which at Midsummer held deposits to the amount of 842,4281.:-
Acdvices from Paris mention that the Southern of France Railway will be opened throughout from Bordeaux to Cette early m March, an event of
considerable importance to commerce. Cette, the I second French port of the Mediterranean, will thus be within 12 hours of Bordeaux, and the transit between the two seas, which has already become important by means of the lateral canal of the Garonne, will be in a condition to receive its full development. The distance between the mouth of the British Channel and MarseiUleswill bediminished from 2,100 miles to 760, and Maltawill be practically nearer for goods and passengers by 830 miles. Such an economy of distance, it is contended, will be a compensation for the transshipment of goods at the termini of the railway, since the saving of time will be even greater in proportion than that of distance, and vessels can freight goods at London or Liverpool, destined for Bordeaux, Marseilles, southern Swit7erland, or the ports of the Mediterranean. Bordeaux and Cette are also expected to become important cetrepoets for the wool trade of Spain as soon as the Spanish railways shall have been completed to Bayonne.
The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that, although only a moderate business had been transacted prices continued to be well supported. There was great firmness in all the principal articles of consimption, and the holders of refined sugar were asking a further advance. The letters from Rouen mention that the market for manufactures was rather depressed, purchases having lately diminished.
At a meeting of the Peel River Land and Mineral Company, held to-day, Sir W. MI. T. Farquhar, Bart., presiding, a dividend at the rate of ls. per share free of income-tax, was declared, and the report and accounts (of which an abstract has been published) were unanimously adopted. The latest advices from the colony are favourable, and in the course of a protracted discussion a variety of suggestions were offered by Air. De Salis, and other shareholders, for improving the property. Complaint s were made that the accounts had not been brought down to a later date, and it was urged that, owing to the facilities now open for iniercourse with Australia, the balance-sheet for 1856 should be ready for presentation. to the meeting at the ensuing half-year. The directors, in explanation, stated that they have forwarded instructions to the colony to carry out this proposal, and that they hope on a future occasion to meet the wishes of the proprietors. The total of the London expenditure was also a point that attracted some attention, but it was more distincty alluded to when a vote of 4001. per annum was moved as remniera. tion to the deputy-chairmnan and other directors, the chairmanl already enljoying an allowance of 30)01.
An amendment to reduce the whole amount from 7001. to 5001. was negatived.
Among recent publications has been a careful Memoir o01 the Eiphrates raUeY Route to India, by T&. W. P. Andrew, the chairman of the Scinde Railway.* The plan now in progress is to establish steamers of extremely light draught throughout the whole length of the Wuprates, froom the point near Aleppo, where that river will be connected With the Mlediterranean by a railway of less than 100 miles, to Bussorah, on the Persian Gulf, whence regular ocean vessels will complete the connexion with Kurrachee and Bombay. The rapidity with which this can be carried out, the smallness of the outlay required, and the fact of the route being 1,000 mDiles shorter than that by the Red Sea, are unanswerable recommendations; and the only argument of objectors has been confined to the expression of doubts as to the complete navigability of the river throughout its entire course. The difficulties in this respect, however, seem to be founded merely on the obsolete experience of sailing vessels, and the documents and authorities now quoted by Mr. Andrew tend to establish in a most positive manner that boats might be constructed to perform the whole distance wvih speed, safety, and comfort. AlU the allegations against the Euphrates navigation put together would not amount to a tithe of those which were urged against the navigability of the river San Juan and Lake Nicaragua, when w17e Times, 10 years back, endeavoured to awaken the public to the importance of that region ; and it is impossible to refer to the surveys and reports of General Chesney and his colleagues on the Euphrates, published 20 years ago, without astonishment that even at that period the British Government and people failed to take imnmediate steps to avail themserves of its capabilities. she ultimate view of the present promoters of the route is to construct a railway of about 800 miles along its bank, by which the transit to India would be reduced from 30 days to 15 or 16 ; but although the resources of the country are such that, according to the latest reports of British consuls and others, it might, wish railway advantages, supply Englaud witsh wheat and other products at a far cheaper rate thant the ports of southern Russia, the attempt to commence the schem e on a cale of this mapo nitude would simply result in its being agar indefinitely set aside. The steam project, with its short connecting line of rail to the Mediterranean, is the only one at present that should receive attention. The concession for this, with a guarantee of six per cent. on the railway, has already been obtained from the Turkish Government. As, however, such a guarantee, judging fromthe present price of Turkish Bonds, is not sufficient, it must apparently depend upon the India-house to decide by the assistance they may be disposed to afford whether the enterprise shall be pushed forward without delay.

The sales of West India bave been small, only 149 hhbds-including 15 lhds. Demerara good bright yellow at auction, that realized 55s. to S6s. per cwt. Yesterday 3,500 boxes Havannash were re-

CoFriEL-The sales to-day consisted chiefly of mocha,viz., 55 bales, 875 half-bales, and 446 frasils. The whole found buyers at 3s. to 4s. per cwt. advance ; ordinary to middling, 74s. 6d. to 78s. Gd. ; and fair to good brown short berry, Sls. to 92s. 200 bags common native Ceylon brought V6s. 6d.
Ries.-2,997 bags Madras sold at 10s. to lOs. Gd. for fair pinky, which was a somewhat lower price. The private transactions ars limited to 100 tons Rangoon at 9s. and about the same quantity of white Bengal at 10s. 3a. to 10s. 6d. per cwt.
S.LT5'PETRE-Tbere is rather more demand, and sales have been made on tho spot at 44s. to 45s. for 5' to 2' per ccnt. refraction, and 42g. 6d. for high refractions. There has also been a moderate business on arrival.
INDIGO (First Day).-The declaration for the sales of indigo, which commenced this morning at the London Commercial Sale-rooms, amounted to 12,909 chests, consisting of 11,189 in catalogue A, which presented the following assortment, viz. :-6,409 Bengal, Benares, &C., 495 plant Oude and Onde, 2,192 Madras, 1,547 Kurpah, 65 Bimlipatam, 161 Manilla, 65 Fig, 10 Pondicherry, 245 not printed, and in catalogue B 1,720 chests of sundries. The sale opened without much spirit, with a parcel of Bengal indigo, of ordinary to middling quality, which was partly realized at a slight advance on the October prices. Later in the day the importers offered their better sorts of Bengal indigo reserved only to about last sale's rates, and a fair proportion has been sold at that currency - qualities, therefore, under 5s. 10d. may be quoted at Octoberratesto3d. per lb. dearer, but above this price as near the rates of the latter half of last sale as possible. In Madras kinds, dry leaf, of which the sale offered a large quantity, was mostly held by the ownera at about October rates, .and were nearly all bought in, the buyers showing a reluctanceo to pay within 3d. per lb. of the proprietors' views ; the few sold, chiefly in the middling sorts, went nearly at this discount. Kurpah, on the other hand, being in more moderate supply, has sold from October prices to 3d. dearer. Speculators have afforded but very little support to the sale. Of the 1,394 chests passed to-day 551 chests have been sold, 150 chests withdrawn, and 693 chests bought in, one-half of the latter dry leaf Madras. Annexed are the particulars of qualities and prices :-Bengal, Benares, &c., middling to good violet, shipping, 7s. to 7s. 4d. per lb. ; ordinary and middling dstto, 6s. 9d. to 7s.; violet and copper ditto, 6s. 6d. to 7s.; good and fine home-consuming qualities and defective shipping, 6s. to 6s. 10d.; low and ordinary ditto, 5s. to 5s.

LXiTIIR ANDi iismFns.-The supply of fresh leather at Leadenhall to-day w.as very small, and a moderate dgmand prevailed for nearly all kinds at fullv late prices. Crops are still scarce, and sell freely on arrival. Foreign butts under 20lb. average, also skins under 501b., per dozen, met au active inqury, and late rates were well supported. There is no change to notice in dressing hides, shaved hides, or horse hides. The demand for kips of all wveights continues good at former quotations. In other articles the sales were not important. MIarket hides were in fair supply, without alteration nn value.

Bacon, which is reported to have takeu place at that port on Stiday evening. She was on her re. tuln trip fromn At erp .o London. It is supposed that cora ng out of the harbour a heavy sea caught her bow ad threw her againstthe pier head, where she stove in her bows and sustained considerabledamage. Captain Bacon, finding that the vessel was fast settling down, succeeded in landing the passengers, but failed in his efforts to get the unfortsnate ship akhore before she went dowvn. The crew happily escaped ill the hots. The Bavensbourne was built for the company in 1S51, and had been employed on the London and Antverp station for senme time. She was of IrOn construc5ion, 690 tons, and 200-horse power.

RAILWAY INT*BLIBNvCa,
RTTYMNRV &
The balf-yearly mneeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Great George-street, Westminster; Mr. J. Boyle in the char.
Mr. Horne, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the progress of the works durine the past half-year had been satisfactory. Upon the original line the Bargoed viaduct, which was the heaviest work on it, had been completed, and the line could be opened in the spring of the present year. Upon the extension line three-fourths of the
antgarw cutting had been excavated. This work was the heaviest upon the line, and the measure of the time of its completion. The hne south of this cutting, which was being made a double line, was nearly completed to the junction with the Taff Vale Railway. All the works to the north of the Nantgarw cutting were progreasing with sufficient rapidity to insure their completion by the time the earth was removed from that cutting. The Bute Dock branch would be completed in three or fourmonths. Upon its completion tae traffic of the Taff Vale Railway would have access to the shipping places at the Bute tidal harbour, and to the saiths of this company on the dock- and an immediate revenue would thus be earned by the comnany upon this
art of their property. Agreements have b4en entered into bctween the company and Lord Bute's trustees for a lease to the company of the land required for the Bute Dock branch (about 25 acres) for a period of 250 a ears, at a rent of 605. per annum. Lord Bute's trustees had further agreed with the company, under the powers of the act of 1855, to coustract the whole of the works on that brancb, so far as it passed over their property, on payment by the company of a rent at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the certifed coat of the work, the company having power at any time to to redeem this rent by payment of the original outlay. When the entire share capital of 200, 0001 shall have been subscribed the directors stato that they will be enabled to create debentures to the amount of 60,0001., and with the funds thus placed at their disposal be able to open the main line from Rhymney to the Taff Vale Railway in the course of the ensuingsummer. Taking the traffic of existing works and collieries on the main line, and omitting from the calculation colieries in course of being opened, and also tho traffic which may be at once expected from the Monmouthshire valleys over the loop line, a gross tonnage of 750,000 tons and a net revenue equal to a per cent. upon 250,0001. may be relied upon for the first year that the railway is opened. The cost of land and works has ver considerably exceeded the estimated amount. To enable the company to double the line throughout when it becomes advisable to do so, the directors have taken the necessary steps to apply to Parhament for powers to raise additional share camtal of 100,0001.; it by preference shares the interest is not to exceed 5 per cent. per annum. Power to abandon the authorized branch to CaerphiMy, and to substitute a line with easiergradients, is contained inthebill. The capital account shows that 143,9051. had been received, and 142,2724 expended, leaving a balance of 1,6331.
The CnAXimLi, in moving the adoption of the report, congrtulated the shareholders on the progress of the works. He had been recently over the line, and it appeared to him that it was being constructed in a first rate-manner. He believed that the estimate of the traffic from lexisting sources would be fully realized. The early opening of the line for traffcc would greatly depend upon the funds at their disposal and the state of the weather. He was happy to say that the tidal harbour would fully answer its purpose. It was intended to appl for POwers to enter into working agreements with the Taff Vale and the Newport, Abergaveuny, and Hereford Ilalway Companies. The understanding between them and those companies was extremely good. The latter company wished to work over their line to Cardiff, as there was not sufficient accommodation at Newport.
A discussion ensued, in the course of which it was stated that they had running powers over the Taff Vale Railwa
The total capital, including the 100,0001 proposed to be raised2, would be 360,0001., and, as the length of the line was 24hmilesjtho cost would notexceedl5,0001. amile, including siIngs, rolling stock, &c. The cost of the Taff Vale Railway was about 25, 0001. per mile, and of the Vale of Neath Railway about the same.
The report was adopted. The retiring directors, Messrs. H. A. ruce, M.P., C. Gilpin, J. Poole, jun., and J, Worthington, were te-elected, as was also Mr. T. E. Scudamore, the retiring auditor.
The meeting was then made special, to consider an agreement entered ito with the trustees of the Marquis of Bute; Admiral Sir G. Tyler, M.P., in the chair.
The solicitor read the heads of the agreement for leasin
land and constructing works between the trustees of Lard Bute and the directors of the company. The estimated cost of the works was 30,0001.
The CHAN moved a formal resolution approving the agreement.
hr. AUISTIN, in seconding the motien, said the arrangements would be mutually advantaeous to both Parties, and were of a satisfactory character. Ee mentioned that when the were in difficulties for money last yearthe Marchioness of lute subscribed for 2,000 ordinary shares, which gave them 20,0001. at a critical period.
Resolutions were passed adopting the agreement, authorizing the directors to borrow 30,0001. on debentures, and approving the bill introduced into Parliament by the board.
'The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors.
EAST LANCASHIRE.
At the half-yearly meeting of this company, to be held on the 27th inst., it appears the directors intend to recommend the shareholders to declare a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum for the past half-year on the ordinary stock of the company.
OXFORD, WORCESTER, AND WOLVERHAMPTON.
The receipts of this company, including the Stourbridge Extension Canal, for the fortnight ending the 1st of FebMary have been 7,7o51.; and the expenditure, also including that of the Stourbridge Extension Canal, 3,8701,, being at the rate of 49-90 per cent., or, withthe amount already ascertained to the 18th of January, a total receipt from the Ist of January to the 1st of Februraof 17,2441.; and a total expenditure of 8,6901., or at the rate of 50-39 per cent.
ANTWERP AND ROTTEEDAM.
In reference to a paragraph under this head which appeared in Tihe mes of yesterday, Mr. L. Schuster states that he never had the honour of occupying a seat at the board of that company - but that, as a shareholder, he suggested an inquiry mto tho management of the affiirs of the company, i7hich resulted in Captain W. M. Shaw's report to hin, an abstract of which was given.
MIDDLESBOROUGH AND GIIISBOROUGH.
The adjourned meeting of this compan7 was held at hiddlesborough on Thursday, Mr. H. Pease m the chair.
M1r. Alderman WIIoSO (Middlesborough) moved that the directors be empowered to lease the line to the Stockton and Darlington Company, or to amalgamate, at a guaranteed dividend of 6 per cent. per annum, for 1,000 year, on a capital of 96,0001., with tbie option of that company purchasing the line.
The Mayor of Middlesborough seconded the resolution.
Captain CHAxONlR saw no reason for disturbing the existing arrangements (a lease for 12 years, at 6 per cent. after the present year) especially as the traffic on the line was increasing, and would soon realize 10 per cent.
Mr. T. T. TRFvoR also opposed the motion.
Ir. C. J. WHAkSTON moved an amendment to the effect that it was inexpedient at present to enter into any terms of lease or amalgamation.
Captain CisIOssns seconded the amendment.
Along discussion ensued, and ultimately the amendment was rejected by 10 to 8, and the original motion was declared carred.

This was an appeal motion against an order of ViceChancellor Stuart, granting an injunction to restrain the trustees of the act for repairing and miaintaining a road from Nantwich to Wheelock-wharf, in Cheshire, from remoVIng tolbars, tollhouses, &c. The question in dispnute was whether a security held by the plaintiff for 2,0001. extended to the tolls of that road, and another road called the New-road, from Weston to Stowford, or only to one of the roads, the security having been made under the General Turnpike Act, and depended upon the construction of the sPecal act U and 12 Victoria, c. 49.
r. Wigram and Mr. Rowcliffe appeared for the appellants; Mfr. Craig and Mr. Iambert were counsel for the
aeon, Mr. Walker, Mr. Malins, Mr. Amphlett Mr. Pearson, and Mr. Wiglesworth for other parties.
After the appeal motion had been partially opened the parties, at the suggestion and by leave of the Court, came to an agreement that the case should be brought on for hearing oefore their Lordships on a fnture day, on motion for a decree, and that the rnoton to dissolve the injunction shouldbeheardatthe same time.

The argument in this case was concluded this day. The COURT took time to consider.
The COURT then proceeded with the other cases on the Crown Paper.
RUSINEASS OF T1{E COURT.
As some interest attaches to the proceedings of the Superior Courts at the present time, it may be as well to state that, although this Court has sat for four whole days since term, there are still considerable arrears in the several
pa ers.
in the New Trial Paper 22 cases have been argued, and 17 remain to be argued, in most of which the ruales were granted during the last term.
In the Special Paper 22 cases have been argued, and 8 remain for argument. The number of cases in this paper has been much increased of late in consequence of the
vision in the Common LaAw Procedure Act, 1852, vhich enables parties to state casecs for the opinion of the Court on mp,ortant questionsof law, withontthe expense of going to tral as formerly.
In the Crown Paper 9 cases have been argued, and 3 remain to boargued. All the cases in tbe several papea which have been argued have also been decided, with the exception of 9 cases on the civil side and 3 on the Crown side. In these 12 cases the Court has taken time to consider, and wil deliver judgment on Tuesday, the 24th inst.
In addition to the cases in the several papers the Court has disposedl of a vast amount of important business which came before it on motions.
All the causes entered for trial at these sittings at nis3i prius have been tried, though not without the assitance of a second Court on this, the last day of the sittings at Westminster.
(Sitings at Nisi Prius, at Wst7minster, before Lord C,s,p-
BELL and Common Jures.)
TATTERSALL V. MILES.
Mr. Chambers and lIr. Hawkins were comnsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Petersdorff for the defendant.
This was an action to recover 1501. for services rendered. The defendant paid 201. into court, and pleaded never indebted as to the rest of the demand.
The plaintiffs were the celebrated auctioneers at Hyde Park-corner, and the defendant was the Eigh Sheriff for the county of Wilts. It appeared that in June last certain racehorses had been taken by the defendant in execution in a case of "Solomons v. Stanley." Mr. Awdrey, the under-sheriff, and his agent, Mr. Street, then went to Messrs. Tattersall's, and consulted them upon the sale of these horses; the plaintiffs told them their terms were 5 per cent. Mr. Awdrey told them the sheriff was only allowed 24 per cent. Messrs. Tattersall said they did not take less. W r. Awdrey then said they should hear from him. He afterwards saw them again, and the 15th of July was named for the sale of the horses, at Fifield, in Wiltshire, and Memrs. Tattersall advertised the sale in Bells Life ania the Racing Calendar on the 6th and 7th of July. On the 8th of JTuly a telegraphic message was received that 3,0001. had been offered. lIr. Tattersall said he thought the horses would fetch 4,0001. by auction. Information was then sent that the horses had been sold for 3,0001. The plaintiffs then made their claim for 150L, being 5 per cent. on the 3,0001., but payment was refused.
These facts were proved by several witnesses, and it was stated that when sales were not effected by their means, after the matter was placed in their hands, the comemission was alway paid. A board containing the conditions of sale at Tattterssll's, dated the 23dof October, 1780, was put in.
For the defence it was contended that the sale had not been effected through the agency of the plaintiffs. They had not been to Fifield, nor had they taken any trouble in the matter; they had only advertised the horses, and for that the defendant paid 201. into court. The sheriff was indemnnified,
Lord ClAaBrLL summed up. If the plaintiffs bad sold the horses there was strong evidence to show they would have been entitled to the loOl. The countermanding the sale was not in contemplation at the time of the first interview. Five percent. appeared tobe for selling. Was there not a retainer of the plaintiffs on the terms they had stated? If the horses had been sold by auction no doubt the plaintifis would have been entitled. Did it make any difference that the plaintffi; hanng received the order for the sale, having advertised the sale, having given their opinion, and being ready to perform their part of the contract, that a private sale had taken place. The plaintiffs said that in their etablishment the custom had been that when once employed to sell, and they had begun the operation, although there was a sale by the owner by private contract, still they always received '.heir 5 per cent. This evidence was uncontra. dicted, b;thit wvas not binding upon the jury to allow the o per cent.; they should see whether it was reasonable, and the usage would seem to make it apcear reasonable. It was not a fairway to say how much had been paid for advertisements. In most trades the remuneration sometimes seemed very liberal; at other times their duties were very irksome. It was for them to say whether the plaintiffs had earned the sum they demanded, or any less sum.
I The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiftk,-Damages,
1501.
PBLEES V. PAvYim.
Mr. T. Atkinson was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. T. Jones for the defendant.
Ihis was an actionto recover 701. for hoard and lodging found and provided for the wife of the defendant.
This was a sad picture of married life.. The defendant, a journeyman shoemaker, in 1850 married a young girL He took her from the church to the plaintift's, who was her brother-in-law. He left her there, and did not return till the evening, when he came back in a complete state of intoxication, and he took her away and said he had only married her for her money (she had about 401.); he draggee
her about to different publichouses till 12 o'clock at night ; he then took her to a house wbere they remained for the niaht in a miserable back kitchen. The next morning he took her asain to the plaintiff's, and at night to a lodging. He was always threatening her with violence about the money, and swore he would kill her if she did not give it up to him. This state of things continued for nine days when, in consequence of his brutality, and lshe then having received her money, she left him and went to live with her brother-in-law. Her husband then lived with a married woman, who had had two children by him. On one occasion afterwards they met by chance, and he said if she would give him 6. he would not molest her again; and so gave him the 61 But he soon commenced his annoyances again. Shehadoriginallytoldhim that if he would pay the debts she had contracted before her marriage she would let him have therest. She had gone to service, bat was not able to remain, on account of the disturbed state of her mind. She had offered to go back to him, but he said he had a woman he liked better, and would have nothing more to do withher. She had lived with the plaintiff at different times, and it was for her board and lodgimg that the present action was brought. There was 841. comnin g to her at he-r grandmother's" eatb, and the plaintiff stated that he had expected to receive his debt out of that.
Lord CAMPBnELL said that it appeared that the plaintiff hadl not looked to the husband, but had expected to get his money from the legacy He had not gve credit to the husband, therefore the defenda would be enttiea to a verdict. e t eenildoa
The jury seemed to demur to this,
Lord CAMPBESI.-Then I direct the plaintiff to be nonsuited.
The plaintiff was therefore nonsuited.
The business of the sittings was concluded, and, by dint of great exertions on the part of the learned judges, all the causes set down for trial were disposed of.
SECOND COUlRT.
(Before Mr. JUstice ERLE and Common Juwis.)
ATRWSON. V. CROMPTON.
Mr. Knowles and Mr. Woollett were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Atherton and Mr. Lush for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action had been in the office of the Morning Post mewspaper, of which defendant is roprietor, as a Canvassing and collecting clerk, and the action was brought to recover the amount of his commission on the advertisements he had procured in the years 1855 and 1856.
From the evidence of the plaintiff it appeared that he had been engaged as a canvassr m Manchester; in April,1S3, he received a letter from Mr. Thompson, defendant'
cashier, offering him an engagemnent as canvasser at .4 salary of 40s. a-week. HBe accepted, and came up to a!ono nto enter on his duties; after some time the duty of collecting the aecounts was also imposed on him, and he spen a considerablo portion of big time in bringing the aecounts into order, and establishing a, better systemt in the office; in the early Part Of 1855 lie applied to Mfr.

Sonme evidence was given as to the commissio asuallly paid to canvassers.
For the defence the case made by the plaintiff was entirely denied. 3Ir. Borthwick stated tbht he had never made any such arrangement as deposed to by the defendant, nor could he, as it was not in his department. The defendant stated he had uever aiuthorzed any such arrangement with the plaintiff, and that he never heard of any claim for commion until after he bad left his employment; the salay of 40s. was to cover all the plaintiff's services
his LORDSIsIP having summed up,
Ihe jary, without hesitation, returned a verdict for the defe-ndant.

HOUSTON V. PETTIT.
Mr. Robinson was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Thomas appeared for the defendant.
hlis was an action brought torecover damages for slander uttered by the defendant of and concerning the plaintiff. The plea was simply "1 Not Guilty." The plaintiff keeps the lapham Ale Stores in the Clapham-road, and the defendant is a milkman. Some dispute having arisen between tDhe parties respecting a bill transaction, although formerly they were friends, the defendant published to the world the following slander:-"Ned Houston is the greatest thief in London. I can transport him, and *a1 I have said I can prove." He also used to a r. Balls the following language of and concerning the plintiff--" That bloody thief has manay times stolen from your bar 80 or 40 cigars at a time, besides bottles of brandy, and given them to rne. I can transport him and all his family." The plaiutiff, conider-
in g that, as the defendant refused to apolo%ize, his character maight suffer, now brought this action for his own vindication.
(Chief Justice COCKBURN in summing up the case to the Jury said that in many insances it was to be regretted that
atons of this nature were brought, but that here the defendant had for three weeks continued to use this ob'ec
tionable language that he had expressed no regret, tut had instructed hbs counsel to throw obloquy upon the plaintiff; and that as there was no justification mado out, the jury must consider whether this was an action which required merely nominal damages, or whether it bad not been properly brought and for the purpose of setting the

Mr. RonnesoN applied for immediate execution, on an a_fdavit stating that the defendant bad said that if the verdict went agaunst him he would sell off all he had and go
Chief Justice CocKUR.-There must be an affidavit on the other side to the effect that the defendant does not purpose leaving the country, otherwise there will be execution n four days. It was arranged finally that the matter should be again mentioned to his Lordship at Guildhall tomorrow or on Thursday.
HINCKS V. LINS.
Mr. Joyce and Mr. T. Salter appeared for the plaintiff; the widow of a German sugar baker, who sought to recover damages for the breach of a promise of marriage made her by the defendant, also a German sugar baker, and for whom Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Charnock were counseL
It appeared that in the year 1852 the defendant became acquamted with Mis. Hineks, and in course of time proposed to her, was accepted, and always afterwards spoke of
is engagement as an arranged matter and of her as his future wife. He some time afterwards went over to Jamaica, expecting to return in three years able to take a
ublichouse, and. live with the plaintiff comfortably.
nng his absence he sent many letters to Mrs. Hincks, but, as they were written by another person at his request, and, as his authority could not be proved, they were merely mentioned by the learned counsel in his opening speech, and were not even tendered in evidence. In consequence of their exclusion the trial, which otherwise might have proved interesting, was dull in the extreme. Shortly after the defendant's return to England he broke off his match with the plaintiff; alleging which was untrue, that she had
ien irth to a chid d urng hisabsence, and ultirately in 1850 he married the =Lanldy of the Mlagpie and Stump, Coble-streetk St. Geor's-fields, also a widow, and so put it out of his power to f his promise to Mrs. Hinck3.
Mir. Serjeant THoAs, for the defence, submitted to a most sovere and lengthy cross-examination every witness caled by the plaintiff, but without elicting any fact favourable to the defendant.
In the course of the cross-examination by the learned serjeant of a German named Ina,
Chief Justice CocsBUBs interrupted him and said that when at the bar he (the learned judge) had always felt the great disadvantages under which a witness laboured, and that as long as he sat on the bench he would never allow evidence to be misconstrued or a witnessto be ledinto asnare "1 I care not a rush, brother Thomas, what your instruc tions are," added the learned judge; "I won't have misconstruction here."
After a most facetious speech from Mr. Serjeant THOMAS, in the course of which he alluded to the habit of Germans to eat sour-krout and saunsages, and to the institation of suttee inUIndia as a resource for widows, he urged upon the jury the s e fact that the defendant, having lost his heart in «nglanr, lost his liver and money in
amaica, and that he was not a very desirable bargain for
The Lord C(iF JuscyE, in summing up the evidence to the jury, aid that there was no evidence that the defendant had lost hls health or his money, that no doubt the landlady of the Magpie and Stump had found him hale and hearty ; that he had made a contract and broken it, and by the imputation which he bad thought fit to cast upon t he plaintiffhe had avated the gnevance. He then went carefully through the facts of the case, commenting carefuly upon each, and the jury, after a few minutes' consideration, returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 50L.

Snpp.in .T,-v I
mr. Atherton and Mr. Manisty were counsel for the plaintiff;l Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Phipeon appeared for the defendantg.
The plaintiff was lately a guard in the service of the Gene Post-office, and sought by this action to recover damages for injuries of a very serious and permanent character, alleged to have been Inflicted by the negligence of the defendants. It appeared that the plaintiff's duty was to accompany the mail from Holyhead to Crewe and back-, and that he was so engaged on the night of the 22d of December, 1855. In consequence of the inclement state of the weather the up mail train was very late at Chester, vhere it arrived, under the direction of an experienced driver named Grace, two hours after its time. After the usual stoppage at that station the mail was started for Crewe, following a goods train. Unfortunatel , that train came to a standstill, owing to the inability of the engine to clear the snow and ice from the
a ils. The usual red light was attached to this train, but the breaksman didnot go backto place fog-signals on the line, and in a very short time the mail train came up, when a collison took place, the result of which was that the plaintiff and his assistant were thrown to the floor of the postoffice carrrage, but no other serson in the train appeared to have experenced any injury. While the trains were at a stsndsti the down mail train came up and the plaintiff was taken homein it toHolyhead,where it was ascertainea that he had received a severe contusion of the brain, from the effects of which he has not yet recovered, and, according to medical testimony, never will so far recover as to enable him to resume his duty. Indeed, it was shown that the plaintiff whose salary had been lo61. had been pensioned off by the Post-office at 36Z. per annum. In order to show that the defendants had been gnuilty of negligence through their servant Grace, it was shown that be had been discharged by the company on the ground that he had not kept a proper look-out on the night in question.
The jury having retired to consider their verdict, and being una le to come to an unanimous verdict as to the amount of compensation to be awarded to the plaintiff the verdict of U was taken by consent, and thereupon the 11 jurors being called into ecurt returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 5001.

This was an action in which the plaintiff, who is a clergyman and curate of Chelsham, near Croydon, sought to recover damages from the defendant, the vicar of the adjoining parish of Fairleigh, for various libeDons letters and slanderous words written and sken of the plaintiff as a clergyman. The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty " and various pleas of justification. When the case had been partly opened,
The CHiEF 1u,tRox interposed, and at his suggestion the whole matter in difference between the reverend parties was referred to Mr. Whately, who undertook to take the case in private instanter.

Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Griffits were counsel for the plaintiff. Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Ellis appeared for the defendant Williams h Mr. Hawkins represented the defendant M'Douall.
The plaintiff was the late bandmaster of the 2d Life Guards, and the defendants are the late and the present colonel of that regiment, the action being brought against them to recover damages for the improper discharge of the plaintiff from the appointment of bandmaster. From the firnt there wero difficulties of a technical character in the way of the nlaintiff's case, and these at last grew to sach an extent that he was nonsuited.
WOULFE AIND ANOTHERI V. PROPErT.
Mr. 1L Chambers and Mr. M. Lloyd were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Hawkins, and 1r* Honyman were counsel for the defendsat.
The plaintiffs are tailors ia Conduit-street, and this was an action to recover their bill for clothes supplied to the
defendant to the amount of 1071. while a student at Hai- I leybury College.
The defendant having pleaded infancy, the plaintiffs replied that the clothes in question were "necessaries."
In support of thb plaintiffi' case the following evidence I was given
John l?blip *oulfe.-I carry on busines with Mr Dolan, as tailors, in Conduitstreet, Regeit-street. We are the plaintiffs. On the 24th of October, 1854, I went to "Mansfield's-house," an inn near Haileybury, to recoive orders from the students, among whom I had several customers. The defendant came in while I was taking an order. By palternswere lying on the table. Tlhe defen. dant took them up and aid, " They are first-rato ar-
ticles." I said, "The best way to show that you appreIciate tbem is to give me an order." He replied that
he came for that purpose, being introduced by a friend, and he gave me an order for a suit, which I sent by a carrier as ordered. I furnished all the articles charged in this bill, except those which were put down as clothes, but really vere money lent and silk furnished. Those items amount to 131. 13s. The first is in December 10, 1855 '- A superfine mixed frock coat and velvet collar, 51. 15s. The defendant had money at several times amounting to 81. 15s. This bill was made out to go to the defendant's father in this shape at the defendant's request.
The CBiE BIsotx.-A grosser and more abominable fraudIdon't know of. If a tailor lends a youth money and ciarges it to his parent as goods sold, that is, in my opinion, worse than picking a pocket.
Mr. CHMAnIs.-Your Lordship is condemning aU these young men, as well as the tailor.
The CnIEF BABoN.-I don't care whom I condemn. It is the practice which I condemn.
The plaintiff's examination was then resumed :-I lent the defendant various sums at different periods. He gave me an I 0 U for 5L I lent him that 6ulh at his request. He came to me and said he had run up a tavern biD in London and could not go back without paying, and that if he did not get money to pay it he should be rusticated. Nothing was then said about the loan being entered as goods. He after. wards asked me to lend him 1l. to pay for a dinner whick was a customary entertainment, and which he had no money to pay for. In December, 1856, he came and said he bad had a present to buy forRn elderlyrelative, but had spent the money, and he should get into a devil of a fix if be could not get the money. He asked me to lend it, I refused at first, and stated I had never done so before, and that it was contrary to my habits. He, however, persuaded me, and I lent him the money, vhich was charged as clothes. The fictitious items amount to 131. 13s. All the rest are for clothes actually supplied. My bill was sent inx half-yearly. I charged the loans as goods at his request when I asked him to repay them. I objected to do so, but he said, " Well, if You don't you won't get your money."
The CIIIF BARON.-Are you aware, Sir, that if you bad obtained this money from the father yon would have been liable to be transported for 14 years ?
Witness.-Indeed I am not, my Lord.
The CHmsE BARON.- Or that you may even now be pro. eceded against for a misdemeanour in attempting to obtain the money ? I think it right, as you confess the matter, to put Won on your guard.
Witness (with great self possessionlI am much indebted to your Lordship, and shall profit, Ihope, by your Lordship's advice; but we have great difficulty in dealing with those young gentlemen.
Cross-examined by Mr. JAMuES.-I know all London tradesmen are prohibited from entering the college. I tried it once. I was not turned out.
Mr. JAMES.-I suppose, Mr. Woulfe, you then went down in sheep's clothing. (Loud laughter.)
Cross-examination of the plaintiff resumed.-I threatened to arrest the defendant on the day he was to go in for his examination, because he broke faith with me. His father paid themoney into court. I afterwards called on his fat4er, when I heard his son was going out to India without paying my bilL He was very angry and said that all tailors who dealt with young men were rogues and swindlers, and that our firm possessed in an eminent degree aU the vices of our clams. I never put down money lent as clothes in any other instance. I say that to the best of my recollection. It is impossible to pledge oneself to a course of dealing over many years. I swear1 never charged Mr. Melville with money in the shape of goods. I did lend him .51, bat it forms no part of my bill as clothes. I made him a present of the loan.
The affidavit of the witness, on which the defendant was about to be arrested at the suit of the plaintiffs, was tAen put into the witness's hand, and he was desired to read it. From that document it appeared that by the first para. graph the witness swore that the defendant was indebted to bis frm in the sum of 1071. "for goods sold in the way of their business as tailors and clothiers."
The Cusm BAeRON, addressing the witness, said,-I have never yet taken such a step, brut I now order you not toleave the court till the close of the ease. (Sensation.) Are you aware, Sir, that you have acknowledged that you bave committed perjury in that affidavit when you swore that the defendant was indebted to you 107. for goods sold and delivered as tailors and clothiers?
The Witness.-No, my Lord. I signed it at the request of my attorneys, to whom I left the matter.
Cross-examination resumed.-I wrote several letters to the defendant soliciting introduction to " freshbven" at the college. The letters were then read to the witness. In one of these Mr. Woulfe announces his intention to visit Mansfield's house on the 20th of September with all the " new autumnal patterns" and solicits the introduction of the defendant to the "new comers." Another thus concludes :-" If Mr. Propert can favour him (the plaintiff Woulfe) with a recommendation to any of the freshmen, Mr. Woulfo would not be unmindful of the obligation the first time Mr. Propert needs his assistance." A third thus concludes :-" Mr. Woulfe would not fail to return the com Iliment when Mr. Propert is in need of assistance."
The Witness.-Those passages no doubt refer to the loans which I had made to the defendant.
Re-examined.-Several respectable London tailors go down to Mdansfield's and receive orders, as I did, from the young men. I do not doanythin like the businessthey do
Thomas Bowaters, a tailor in Conduit-street, proved the fairness of the plaintiffs charges.
Cross-examined.-I do not lend young men money and charge It as a coat.
Re-examined.-I always considered the plaintiff's a respectable firm.
Ir. Loonard Harrison, another tailor, gave similar testimony.
lIr. EDWLN JAMEs, having addressed the jury for the defendant, procoeeded to call the following evidence:-
Mr. Propert.-I am a surgeon in New Cavendish-street, I have seven children. The defendant is my second son, and will not be of age till September next. When he went to and while he remained at Haileybury he was amply supplied with clothes and pocket-money. I first hearid of the plaintiff's account in June last. 3Mr. Woulfe called on me shortly before this action was commenced. I sent my solic
tor down, who paid the money into the sheriff's hands to prevent the arrest of my son, which would have prevented his examination. He sailed on the 4th of October as a writer. I never saw the letters, nor knew of them till I heard them read to-day. I paid 591. for my son during the time of this bill. My son never went on the continent, nor did he intend to go there before he sailed for India.
Mrs. Fropert proved the birth of the defendant, and the Eupply of clothes to him by his father's tailor.
Cross-examined.-I have seen him wearing other clothes than those supplied by his father's tailor, but I thought the were anpplied by the college tailors, for whom there is a c arge of 10u. per term always.
The examination of the defendant wras then read, in which he gave an account of the clothes and loans obtained from the plaintiff, and also of the articles obtained from his father's tailor.
Mr. M. CHAaBERs, in reply, contended that the case for the defendant had broken down, as the evidence fell far short of proving that the defendant had been supplied with clothes to an extent suitable to his position at Haileybury College and the position in life of his father, who appeared to be not only a man of high professional repute, but also to be possessed of considerable property. He could not, indeed, defend the morality of his client in lending money to the defendant, and charging the loans as clothes; hut, on the other hand, the defendant, wsho had availed himseld of those loans, onght to have been the first to discharge them.
The CunuF BARON, in sumnsing UD the case, observed that it waas one w.hich had given himn great pain and sortification on many accounts. I[e grieved that the father of the defendant should be pheed in the position iac which he was by the extravagance of his son, and he was shocked to see one who was described as a respectable tradesman admit that he had conducted himself as the plaianiff had done in his dealings with the defendant while a student at Haileybury College. It was also painful that counsel should attemptto gloss over that conduct, and, he for one, saust enter his protest against it. for he could not but consider it as highly discreditable. There were certain actions against Thich it was ohf time that a firm stand should oe made by judgestand jrors. The actions against husbands for goods, supplied to extravagant wives, and for goods suppliedto an excessive extent to infants, wthich were virtually actions agaainst their parents, were such actions, This action was of the latter class, and the question was whether the goods for which it was brought wvere necessaries, the defendant being clearly an infant at the time of their sale. In his opinion, a father, and not a tailor, was the proper judge, in point of law and fact, of whet were or were not necessary articles of clothing for his son while in statu pupiWari. lor was the son the judge. He ,was not at liberty to contract debts and extravagant habits because other young men did the same with whom be -ssociated. What he shouldlay down to the jury now was that if they believed the plaintiff dealt u-ith the defendant as he somewhat unblushingly admitted;he did, knowing that he was not of age, and was contracting debts which were unjustifiable, and for clothes which were not wanted, then they ovght to find for the defendant. With respect to the loans
whlih were falsely charged as goods to the extent of 13
uineas, the plaintiffs could not recover them in any form. VVhen the character of the plaintiffs' dealings first CaUne out he (Sir F. Pollock) was more than surprised. He was shocked at the idea of an apparently respectable peison so conducting himself in his business. Such transactions were about as dishonest and fraudulent as could well be. 'Ihey sapped society and morals at the very roots, and were not less serious than the offences which had ately shocked the world. With regard to the rest of the ill, if the jury thougbt the plaintiff Woulfe went down to the inn near Haileybury to inveigle the students into giving him extravagant orders, and induced the defendant to give such orders, and lent money to the defendant with the designof charging it asgoods, and knew that the supply of clothes was one which the defendant's father would not sanction, then he was of opinion that the plaintiffi could not recover even thoso items which were for goods so supplied. WVhore the supply is secret and fraudulent the plaintiffs ought not to-be allowed to enforce their claim. As to the mode in vhich the plaintiff had sworn the affidavit, it was, to say the least, very careless, and it was no excuse for him to put it on his attooney, and to say he swore it as a mere matter of form. The 3ury would look at the whols case, and say what they thought of it, and whether the goods were necessaries.
The jury at once returned a verdict for the defendant.
SECOND COURT.
(Sittingt et ZAVii Prius, beford Mr. Baron MAhIrM aend
Common Juries.)
Mr. T?owell appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Serjeant Paost and Mr. lIenniker for the defendant.
Lt as an action brought upon. a. warranty of a mare. The defendant plexaed that the mare was sound at the time the warranty was givena
It appeared that the plainstiff was a horsedealer, and that
liehad urOh-.ed the mare in question on the 14th of August ltor 45L, at Horncastle fair, from the defendiant, who ',ad warranted her sound and a good worker. The plantif kept the mare in his stable for tbree weeks, when the as purchased from him by a person who very shortly -`returned her in consequenoe of a pretty little trick she had vf kicking. The only other fault that was found with her ,was that sne was suffering from "g laUcoma," a disease of 'the eyes which prevented her fronm " appreciating" objects. Eor instance, she had stumbled over a biundle of straw -which had been placed on the ground, instead -f stepping over it, And she had looked at a carriage and a wheelbarrvow as if she did not know what they were. The plaintiff, having taken her back, had sent her to Aldridge's, where she was 'aold at a loss of 211., the sun now sought to be recovered.
Several witnesses were called to prove the facts as stated on behalf of the plaintiff
The defence was that the animal in question had been u:rchased in 1855 by a Mr. Osborne, a gentleman who had driven her for 11 months, during which period she had been perfectly quiet and sounde He had placed her in the hands 'f the defendant, a horsedealer, to sell her at the fair. A.t that period she was perfectly sound, and she must have acquired her bad habits and the disease of the eyes in the plainti78 stable.. The mare was perfectly sound at the present time.
Witnesses having been called in support of this view of the case,
The learne( dcounsel addressed the jury for their respective clients.
Mr. Baron MAnRiN said that the question for the jury would be whether the mare was sound at the time the .warranty was given. If they thought she was sound they must find for the defendant; if they thought otherwise, their verdict must be for the plaintiff, with such damages as they considered he was entitled to.
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 211., the amount claimed.
FOSTER V. raITrIIARD.
Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Francis appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hannan for the defendant.
The declaration in this case was for forcibly entering the plaintiffs premises, and seizing certain goods the pro erty of the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded "- Not Guiifty.'
It appeared that a person named Charles Foster, the zon of the plaintiff, had incurred a deb)t, and a plaint was issued against him in the Southwark County Court. As he did not appear on the trial, judgment went by default, and the defendant, the high bailiff of Southlwark, was inatruated to levy for the amount due. He, however, went to the plaintiff's house and seized his goods, notwithstanding lie was told that no goods belonging to Charles Poster were there. This action was therefore brought.
On the part of the defendant it was urged that he had not received sufficient notice of trial, and that he was not liable for the acts of his agents, as the high sheriffi were.
His LVBDSIcnm gave the defendant leave to move on the ground that the notice of trial was not sufficient, but overx'uled the second objection, saying that the act had expressly wnade the high bailiff hable for the acts of his agents, in order that there should be a responsible party in case of anything wrong being done.
The further defence was that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe that the goods seized were the property of Charles Foster, inasmuch as a short time before the plaintiff had been insolvent, and he could not therefore be supposed to have a hotuse full of furniture.
His LoRiDsI1IP having summed up,
The juryreturned a verdict for the plaintiff for 10l.
WILLIAMNS V. LEFTWICIH.
Mr. Salter appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Henry James for the defendant.
This was an action for an assault and false imprisonment and for a malidcous prosecution. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty," and that he had reasonable and nrobable cause to believe that the plaintiff had embezzleT certain moneys the pro%rty of the defendant.
It appeared that the plaintiff had been in the employnaent of the defendant, an ice merchant, for 17 years, during which period nothing had ever been found against him. In the course of last autumn, however, he had been arrested on the ground of having received various sums, amounting in the whole to 351., from a Mr. Henry Bevan, for whinn be had not accounted to the defendant. He was taken before a magistrate and remanded for a week, during which period he remained in prison. On appearing again before the magistrate he was discharged, the defen ant being unable to substantiate his charge. Sabsequently he looked over the books, and found that he had reaUy received 21. 13s., for which be had not accounted. He then went to the person who had succeeded him at the defendant's place of business, and gave him the money due to the defendant, telling him at the same time to make a false entry in the book about it; but telling him if he should be asked -bout it to tell the truth. This person told the defendant, who imediately prosecuted him for embezzling the smaUer Sum, but the plaintiff was again discharged. Under these circumstances the action had been brought.
The plaintiff in his cross-examination admitted that he hlad received several sums from Mr. Bevan for ice, of which he had not made any account to his master, but he endeavoured to explain this by saying the ice sold to Mr. Bevan was his own. He further stated that when he left 501b. of ice at Mr. Bevan's the cook made him put down 0l01b., and that, although the book contained the larger entry, he was only paid for the smaller amount actually delivered. At aU events, he made it all right with his master, for he put it down to other people, and he after bought more ice on his own account.
By aJuror-He used his master's horse and cart to carry -the ice he himself purchased.
Mr. Baron MARTIN suggested that a juror should be withdrawn, for it was evident that the defendant had reasonable and probable cause for believing that the plaintiff had embezzled his money. In fact, he thought that a man who went to his master's customers and sold goods as if for his master on his own account was quite as morally guilty as if he had committed embezzlement, although there miht be no punishment awarded to it. He must caution the plaintiff not to pursue the same course in future.
After some discussion it was agreed that the plaintiff should be nonsuited.
Plaintiff nonsuited accordingly.

AUDDMESEX S2EMOES, Tuea Feb. la.
(Before Mr. PASaxEY, Q.C., Assistantl.Judge.)
John Atkins, 20, was indicted for unlawfully and inde~ently assaulting Amelia Read, a child eight years of age.
Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prosecution; the prisoner was not defended.
The evidence clearly showed that the prisoner had been ,uilty of an assault of a most scandalous description, but as Lt appeared that the child did not resist he was acquitted on the point of law as to consent.
Mr.SLErser said, it was quite clear, according to the facts, that the prisoner was guilty, but the verdict had been given under what unfortunately was the present state of the law with reapect to such a case.
The AzssTA.T-J`uDno quite agreed with Mr. Sleigh as to tho unfortunate state of the law, and allowed the costs of the prosecution.
John Turner, 49, described as a clerk, and of superior education, was indicted for assaulting two police-constables, named Ed,hill and Keeble, in the execution of their duty. He pleadea " Guilty."
The prisoner had the appeararce of a person who had been reduced from respectability by dissipation. Theprison officers stated that he had been so frequently committed for drunkenness and assaulting the police that they had been unable to make out a complete return of the number of times. The police stated that the magistrate was so tired of sending him to prison summarily that he committed him for trial on the present charge.
The A5S15TAT^.T-J1-DGE sentenced him to nine months' hard labour.
Michael Cwumins, 18, an ill-clad and miserable-looking being, pleaded " Gcilty" of stealing 16ib. of beef, the property of J. Lamb, from a shop.
The AsSISTAwT4TDoGR said, he found from the prison return that on a former occasion the prisoner had been convicted of an offence of the same description-stealing beef -and had, besides, been committed for other offences. He asked the prisoner why he committed the theft?
The prisoner said, he did it through want.
The AssisTAwT-JuDGx said, he should have gone to the parish authorities, who were bound to give him relief if he were in want and destitute aud could not get work. What parish did the prsoner belong to ?
The prisoner said, tatcliff; and on the day he took this meat he went three times for relief, and was sent away from the doors.
MIr. POWiNALL, who was on the bench, said, the public were not aware, perhaps, of the great number of young persons who were sent to prison for larceny of provisions; it was a number far greater than would meet ready belief. The parsh officers would not give them relief; they wandered about for days and nights together, and at last they were driven to steal food, for which they got sent to prison, and thus the burden, instead of being borne by the parish, as it should be, was thrown upon the county, and the pauper became a felon. The prisoner at the bar was an object far more fit for the workhouse than a gaol.
The AssIsTAsT-JuDGEsaid, theparish officers werebound to give relief to persons destitute and in want, and if they did not they would soon find themselves in an awkward position; and if what the prisoner said were true, the relevingofficer of Ratcliff ought to know the law a little better. Re was informed that t.he prisoner's father earned 31. a-week, so he should have looked to him.
T'he prisoner said his father and mother were "too great a pair of drunkards"to do anything for him-they turned him out.
The AsszSTArNT-JUDGx said, he was sorry to hear it. Hlowever, the prisoner had been guilty of an offence for which he must be punished; he had, besides, been repeatedly in prison, and a former conviction was proved against him. He should, therefore, sentence him to 12 months' hard labour.
William Cox, a marine store-dealer, carrying on business at Stepney, was tried and found Guilty on a charge of feloniously receiving a hundred and a-half, uin weight, of lead, the property of Robert Charles Tatham, knowing the same to have been stolen.
The AsssisTAN-JuDGE said, a worse offence could not be conceived, and sentenced the prisoner to six years penal servitude.
MIr. Caarteen prosecuted; Mr. Way appeared for the prisoner.
Caroline li[ogan, 30, and Ellen Handy, 20, were indicted, and found GniUy of stealing a Crimean medal with four clasps, the property of Henry Wright, from his person. Hogan was sentenced to nine months' hard labour, and HTandy, en old offender, to four years' penal servitude.
(Before Mr. CREAsy.)
Robert Hills, 24, and Ann Hill, 24, were indicted for stealing a large quantity of horse provender, the property of the London General Omnibus Company. The male prisoner pleaded " Guilty," and no evidence being given against the woman she was AcquUted.
Mr. CREcAsy sentenced the man to six months' hard labour.
Mxr. Cooper and Mr. Lewis appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Ribton for the prisoners.
John Beavis, 21, and Richard White, 19, were indicted for having stolen a uantity of gunpowder, value 37., the property of Thms h Gilson.
M:r. Cooper prosecuted; Mr. Eorrv defended.
The prosecutor was an ironmonger at Hounslow, and the gunpowder was stolen from his warehouse. Beavis had been -.n his serice, and it appeared that he and the other prisoner were seen to take from a ditch a number of packeages which had been buried, and which, from the description, were, no doubt, those containing the gunpowder, the property of the prosecutor which had been stolen
The defence was an alio, but
The iury found both prisoners GuiUy.
Beavis, who had been previously convicted, was sentenced to four years' servitude; and White to six months' hard labour.
John Reeves, 18, and Samuel Nettle, 18, were indicted for unlawfully assaulting Job Smitb, a police-constable, in the execution of his duty, and for stealing seven fowls, value 21. 10s., the property of Peter Kennedy.
Mr. Orridge appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Payne for Reeves.
The jury found both prisoners Guity.
Mr. CUli&SY sentenced Reeves, wbo had kicked the policeman in a disgusting manner, to 12 months', and Nettle to six months' hard labour.
Ann Cooney, 30, was indicted for steahng a blanket and other articles, the preVerty of George Gold.
The prosecutor's wife was ill of a brain fever, and the prisoner, who was engaged to attend her, took advantage of the opportunity to carry off a considerable quantity of clothing and bed linen. She was found Guilty, and sentenced to six months' hard labour.

MANsION.xsOUsE.-The LORD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of the following sums for the poor-box:-From "M M. P.," the second half of a 5C.-note; from " B. B.," lOs. ; and from " W. E. W.," 03.
MARLBO8OUGH-STREET.-From "A.B.,"101.; "DD H.," 51.; and "J. R.," 1U., have been received for the poor-box.
MARYL5MONE.-The sitting magistrate received the following donations for the poor widow Mrs. ADsop, who had been deprived by death of her five sons while serving for their Qaeen and country, three of them having been "laid low" at Cabnl, and the other two in the Crimea. The particulars of the case appeared in our yesterday's paper:-"A Soldier's Widow," 51.; "A. Z.," the half of a 51.-note; Sir Michael Smith, lOs. *J. G." Parthenon, a Post-office order for ll. ; W. Watling, Pimlico, a check for 11.; "r. M IV.," 11.; "The Son of a Widow," ll.
"MNrs.T.,"lOs.; "l S H."lOs.; Mr. Wilkes, Commissioner of Lunacy, 11., Mrs. Tremenheere, lOs.; " A. PoorJew," os.; "'m. S. ," 5s.; and IMado," os., in postage-stamps. In addition to the above sum for the widow Mr. BRouGniToN received 31., " coUected by a lady in the vicinity of Harewood-square, ia aid of distressed workmen out of employ."
WEST IINSTER.-Joseph MaUan, alias Sykes, and Webb Paton were finally examined, charged withfelony.
The prisoners went to the house of Mr. Bannister, 63, Coleshill-street, Pimlico, and, intruding themselves into the dining-room, were found there making themselves very mucwh at home, the former lounging upon the sofa, and the latter warming himself in an easy chair. On Mr. Bannister's entrance Paton, although a perfect stranger, familiarly extended his; hand, which Mr. Bannister in the surprise of themoment took, but, on recovering himself, hinted that he had not the pleasure of being acquainted with either of them. Paton affected much surprise that Mr. Bannister did not know him, and, having introduced Malian as a Crimean hero who had lost a leg, entreated Mr. Bannister's sympathy, and a private interview. Mr. Bannister, who was lost in wonderment at what all this could mean, declined the interview, and told the men they had better bh off. They took him at his word, but had no sooner turned their backs than he missed his silver spectacles from the room. Ho went in pursuit of the fellows, and collared them, when MaaUan dropped the spectacles.
Theprisoners, who ha been identified by Sergeant Loom, a detective officer, as two of a notorious gang of thieves, Paton having been twice convicted of felony, were remanded in consequence of the numerous complaints of impudent robberies committed,by rsons of their description and, on their being agasu placed in the dock yesterday,
Colonel Sir John Wilson said that on Wednesday week they came to him, shook hands with him at the maoment, before he had time to remember whether he knew anything of them, and endeavoured to obtain some money of him with the story that the lame man, who had lost his leg in the Crimea, wanted the means of purchasing a new pair of crutches. They stuttered and stammered, and, s their account was anything but satisfactory, he avoided their imposition, and sent them about their business
Inspector Forman, of Ithe B division, said, that the lame prisoner had obtained 101. from a gentleman named Penn, in Onslow-square, by a forged letter of recommendation purporting to be written by the Rev. Mr. Irons, vicar of trompton. Succeeding in that fraud, he had manufactured the death of his aged mother, with a certificate from her medical attendant, to obtain some more money, when he was captured on Mr. Bannister's charge.
It was also proved that the prisoners had intruded themselves into two other houses and obtained money.
They were committed for triaL

Woirzjprs mr.-Jeremiah Dri4coV was charged, at the instance of the Society for Brexentiou of Cruelty to Animals, with the following illusage of&i6r-se:-
Sinclair, one of the sidety's constables,' atated-I was in Sitalields-market at 8 eclolk tbis morning, when I found tne ptiioher in chArge of S., pony and prt, the latter; fiUed with potatoes asd. other vegetables. My attention was attracted.to .tbe pony- DOticig IJi extreme difficulty it ,xhbibited in 101wing, the cart, *hi,b; in fact, it could

stirred, and the whole weight of the oart was pressing upon it.
The brother of the prisoner stood forward and said-My father died about 10 months ago, and, as this brother had no way of living, I bought the pony last Christmas to fetch things from market, while my wife attends to the shop. Tho pionyis mine, and I trust You will be as moderate as possible, asI was cheated when I boughtit.
3fr, D'EwcouRr.-Indeed I shall not be lenient, for, if magistrates did not in some degree protect dumb animals, there is no knowing what woold become of them or what they would suffer with such men as you. You (to defendant must pay a penalty of 40a., and the society, I think,
had now better consider the propriety of punisbing the.
CLERKE.nVEnL.-RObertMOOZe and Edwin Hammond, two-respectably dressed ren, were placed at the bar charoe, with causing the deathof Richard Cotterelt, by strikcing him.
It appeared from the evidenc that the deceased, the prisonere, and anotherman, had been drinking together at a publichouse on the he the 30th nit., and had partaken very freelyof spirituous dtinks. When near the corner of York-road, Fussen , of the Great Niorthern lailway Police, sawr the tro prisoners chasing a man, and afterwards sawthr
two prisoners hit at the deceased. Ec aftcrwards saw Hammond strike the decased with such forac that he fell down, and struck his head so that it rendered him insensible. He then took Hammond into custody, and altimately, withotheidof 386 A, the h,risoners were locked up, and the injured man conveyed to the hospital, dhere He hremained some time, and the case was compromxtd on Saturday by the injured man receiving some compensation from the prisoners. He then went home, and died the next day at12 o clock, which coming to the ears of Sergeant Holmes, 29 S he took the prisoners into custody, when Mammond said that ddoore had done it
Mtr. H. Sulliran, a surgeon of Church-row, St. Pancras, said he saw the deceased on Saturday week, and recommended that he should be taken to the hospitaL Hehad little doubt that the injury he had received was the canse of death. He had little doubt but that the cause of death was e:stravasation of blood on the brain. His eason for giving I that opinion was that the deceased had had fits ever since
he had receied the injury.
The nhagistrate said he did not think there was ny case made out against aoore, and he wonld be discharged. The other prisoner Would be remanded until Saturday next, by which time the result of the coroner's inquest would be known. Ihe w eould, howiever, accept hail for his appearance, himself in 200r, and one surety in 100Z.
The bail was put in and the prisoner lberated. "-na;. L." has sent 5is. for the poor-bo:.
TILU1ES.-Eliza Horrigan, an Irish woman, aged 40, and dwelling in Lower WeU-aney,Wapping, was brought beforh Mr. YARinLxY, charged with committing a savage assault on a waterman named Strong, who appeared in court with his faze covered with blood, and three surgical plaisters upon it.
The complainant said he was passing by the shop of Msr. Duncan, a provision merchant, near the EIermitage-bridge, Wapping, and saw the prisoner, who was quarrelling with and abusing MIr. Duncan, and at last made a blow at him with a large half-allon jug. Mr. Duncan warded off the blowv, which feff direct on the face of witness, and nearly knocked off his nose. He was dreadfully cut, and lost a pint of blood.
ThePrisoner.-I never intended to hit that man, your honour's worship, for the life of me.
Mr. YARDLEY.-NO, you intended the blow for some one else. You have mutilated his face very badly and nearly cut his nose off.
Mr. George Duncan said, the prisoner was in the habit of comning to his shop three or four times a-week, and very seldom made a purchase. That mornig she made herappearance again, and attempted to secrete a fish under her shawl. He took it from her and charged her with coming into the shop for the purpose of plunder. She then took up some ciscuits and threv them at him. He ejected her from the shop, and she took some potatoes from the window-boardand hurled them at his head. She then struck at him with a large and heavy jug, but he evadedthe blow, which fell upon the waterman, and with such force that the jug was broken to pieces. She afterwards took up the pieces and shied them at his head. The prisoner was a most violent and dishonest woman, and he believed she never came to his shop except for thepurpose of carrying off anything she could lay her hands on.
The prisoner made a long and rambling defence, but gave no answer to the charge of violence preferred against her, and the evidence of a witness she called had no reference to the case set up for the prosecution.
Mr. YARDLEY said the prisoner was a very heartless, cruelp il-disposed woman, and a person of very savage disposition. She was also as dishonest as she was violent. He sentenced her to pay a fine of 51., and indefault committed her to the House of Correction for one month.
SouTRwARx.-Yesterday Mr. Solomon handed to Mr. ComBE two guineas from Mr. Trotman for the poor-box. His worship also received a 51-note from 'X X."
Lvamgyrm.-Charles Butler, a servant in the employment of Messrs. Simpson and Maule, manufacturing and practical chymists in the Kennington-road, was finaly examistd before Mr. EuLIOmT on a charge of plundering his em, ployers.
Theprisoner, who had been two years in the employment of the prosecutors, and who had been taken back into their employment from mere motives of humanity and on account of his family, had been suspected of dishonesty from some valuable drug being found in the pocket of his jacket, and which jacket he put on when leaving the premises. Sergeant Coppin wvas in consequence employed to watch him, and when taken into custody by that officer the prisoner had a pound weight of white ginger belonging to his employers in his pocket. On his lodging being searched several bottles containing various drugs were found there, and there could be no doubt that he had carried on an extensive system of plunder.
A solicitor who attended for the prisoner affected to make very light of the charge, and hoped his worship would consider the week's imprisonment his client had then had a sulficient punishment.
Mr. ELLroTr replied, he conld not consider anything of the kind. There could be no doubt that the prisoner Sad earried on an extensive system of plunder, and he should therefore give him the highest penalty the law permitted, and that was six months' hard labour.
Caroline Price, ali<u Gibson, a smartly-dressed yoang woman, was finally examined and fully committed for trial on a charge of stealing a pair of blankets from her readyfurnished lodgings.
The prosecutor said that the lodgings had been taken by a person named Price, who held a responsible situation at Hodges's Distillery, and who represented the prisoner as his wife, but that since the robbery that person had declared she was a person he pickee up at the Bower Saloon.

Recruiting for tho several infantry regiments having been for the present suapended, it has bean determined that those corps on the Indian establishment in want of men to com. plete their strength shall be augmented from regimenit
which are above theirprescribed etetblishment. A number of men belonging to various infantry regiments at Aldershott have volunteered for the 35th, 70th, anud 84th Regiments, and will proceed to Chatham to join the depOts of those corps at that garrison.
A great deal of activity prevails among the troops at Chatham garrison,where there are at preeent about 500 men belonging to the various branches of the service, daily undergoing a course of rifle instruction,-the troops of the Line under Captain W. Nott and Lieutenant A. MLeod, the Royal lMarines under Major G. B. Rodney, and the Royal Engineers under Lieutenant G. R. Lempriere, Instructors of Musketry. As the Season is approaching when nearly2,000young soldiers will leave Chatham to join tho head-quarters of their respective regiments in India, great pains are taken to have each man instructed in the use of the Enfield rifle previously to his landing in that country.
Her Majesty's steam-fiigate Arrogant, 47, Captain Lyster, was officially inspected and the crew mustered at Spithead yesterday by Vice-Admiral Sir George Seymour, K.C.B., the Commander-in-Chief, after which sho went into Portsmouth harbour to be paid off.
The Transit iron steam troopship, having been refitted, was taken out of Portsmouth harbonr yesterday to prove hermachinery, before beingreported ready for troop service. Itis possible she may take the 90th or 82d to Madras.
The Sharpshooter, 9, iron steam-sloop, was taken into dock At Portsmouth yesterday to be refitted.
The Osborne, Admiralty state-yacht, fr. G H. K. Bower, master, RN., commanding, was undocked yesterday after alterations and remasted.
The Vesuvius, 6 guns, paddlewheel steam-sloop, arrived at Sheerness yesterday morning from Woolwich, to be placed in the steam squadron of reserve there, under the coommand of Captain Edward P. Halsted, of the Edinburgh, 60 guns, screw steamship.
The Cyclops, 6 guns, paddlewheel steam-frigate, of 320horse power, hadc her engines tried in the fitting basin at Sheerness yesterday, after having been under repair The trial was satisfactory.
It is reported that the Nimrod, 6 guns, screw steam despatch vessel, now being fitted and stored in the basin at Sheerness, is to be commissionod and proceed to China, to relieve the Barracouta, 6 guns, paddlewheel steam-sloop, Commander Thomas D. A. Fortescue.
A lage supply of Enfield riflemuskets has arrived at Chatham from the Tower for the use of the troops attached to the Provisional Battalion.
The Renown, 91, screw steamer, having been completed at Chatham dockyard, preparations are being made for launching her, which event is expected to take place during the ensuing month.
A lifeboat intended for presentation by Government to the Government of Chili, in consideration of succour rendered by the Chilians to British mariners in distress, is lying on the boathouse wharf at Woolwich, awaiting an opportunity for conveyance to her destination. This boat is built on the principle of a design produced by Mr. J. Peake, assistant master shipwright of Woolwich Dockyard. Her length is 30 feet; width, 8 feet beam; depth amidships, 3 feet 4 inches, exclusive of keel; ditto, from boat's floor to deck, 1 foot 3 inches; ditto, from deck to thwarts, 1 foot 3 inches; ditto, from thwarts to gunwale, 10 inches; length of end cases, 4 feet; width of side cases extreme, i foot 6 inches. She is provided with 12 oars, and is extremely light; is double banked, and weighs about two tons. She is furnished with a water-tight deck at the load water line, detached air-boxes along the sides, and water-tight air-cases within board, which render the boat unsubmergible and self-righting. A great amount of estra buoyancy is derived from large end air-cases built across the bow and stern, occupying from 3 feet to 44 feet in length, from the stern and sternpost to gunwale height. According to extracts published by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, these cases are chiefly intended to provide self-righting power, but in the event of the boat being stove in, and the space below the deek being filled with water, they alone have sulficient buoyancy to float her. She possesses likewise self-acting valves which open downwards only, so that they wiU allow any water shipped to pass downwards, while none beyond a trifling leakage can pass upwards through them. She has exterior life-lines affixed round the entire length of the boat to which pesons in the water might cling until they could be got into the boat, as well as two central life-lines lower than the others to be used as stirrups to assist persons in the water to enter the boat. The design was gratuitously furnished by Mr. Peake to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1S55. He has since devoted much time and attention to the subject of improvements which have from time to time been suggested. The boat was builb at Limehouse bv Messr. Forrestt.
The Admiralty yacht Vivid was yesterday morning brought alongside the wharf at Woolwich Dockyard, and returned stores. She has been placed gratuitously by Government at the disposal of the Royal Maipacket Company for three months, to run between Dover and the continental ports. The Princess Alice, recently lent by the Lords of the Admiralty to the same company, wiU be retained in the service for a certain period. Captain Smithett arrived at Woolwich yestrday, and took charge of the Vivid for conveyance to Dover. Master-Commander AUen, with his officers and crew, are transferred for service to Her Majesty's paddlewheel steamvessel Banshee, which has been fitted at Woolwich with considerable alterations and improvements, and is to be employed temporacily as an Admiralty yacht and tender to the Fisgard, in place of the Vivid.
The freightship Northfleet, engaged in shipping war stores at Woolwich pier for China, is e xpected to sail on the 22d inst. Her upper deck is to be set apart for the nse of Lieutenant Anderson and a detachment of the Royal Artillery, under orders to embark on the 21st for passage to Hongkong.
The steam-sloop Vixen, Commander George J. Mecham, is to leave Woolwich basin to-day. Her destination is re. ported to be tho Pacific.
The following appointments have been made at the Admiralty:-Lieutenant Richard Hoops, to the Royal William, tor service in Devonport ordinary; Lieutenant Douglas Reid, to be agent in charge of mails - Lieutenant E A. Porcher, to the Hibernia; Thomas DobWin, Acting Second Master, to the Iris; Charles A. Lees, Acting AssistantSurgeon, tO the Victory; Stephen J Barker, Acting Assistant-Snrgeon, to the Impregnable; Walter P. J. Pnrves, Acting Assistant-Surgeon, tO the Victory; Charles S.

THE COAL PORTS.-Browne's Export List gives
THE CoAL PoBTs.-_B1 owiSExzport Lt ves returns of the exportation of coals from the princinal ports in the kingdom in January. The Tyne sent 71,7 tons of coals and 10,897 tonsof coke over sea; the Wear, 34,326 tons of coals and 3,972 tons of coke; the Hartlepools, 18,810 tons of coals and 397 tons of coke- Liverpool, 30,148 tons of coals and 137 tons of coke-* Cardiff, 78,821. tons of coals and 693 tons of coke; Hull, 8I682 tons of coals and 369 tons of coke; Newport, 14,805 tons of coals; Grimsby, 6,314 tons of coals; Glasgow, 5,268 tons of coals; Allos, 5,287 tons of coals; Middlesborough, 1,282 tons of coals and 785 tonsofcoke. The shipments of coals coastwise in January were-from Newcastle, 175,506tons - Sunderland 122,857 tons; the Hartlepools, 98,b30tons; Hul, 2,246tons; Cardiff, 44,904 tons; N1ewport, 364,462 tons; Marort, 26,983 tons; Whitehaven, 15,510 tons; Seaham, 55,035 tons; and from the smaller ports about 71,445 tons. On account of the violent storms that prevailed in the early part of the month the aggregato quantity of coals shipped from the north-east ports was less than in January, 1856 The value of goods, other than coals and coke, exported from the north-east ports in January was as undor :-Xeircastle, 74,9611.; same period of last year, 66,3541.; increase, 18,6071.

ATTEMPTED MURDER AT DARTMOOR PRISON.- It will be recollected that we reported in TIK Times a short time ago the trial of a lad named Riloy, at Exeter, for attempting to murder Alexander Carrick with a spade at Dartmoor Convict Prison. A similar case has just occurred at the same prison, a young man, aged only 19% named Lewis Francis, having been committed to the Devon County Gaol for striking Henry Brown, one of the warders, with a spade, with intent to murder him. It a*ppears that the prisoner has been for many years a professional thief, and during the last four years has been con. victed of several offences in different parts of the country. He was convicted at Liverpool of picmig pockets, and sen. tenced to four years' penal servitude. He has been at Dartmoor for a period of 23 months, and his conduct during the whole of that time has been of the worst description. It is reported that while engaged in outdoor work he struck the warder with considerablo violence with the spade which he was using, and inflicted serious injuries on the officer.
FRExcH FRIGATES i BnISH POBTS.-Captain Sevin, of the Niavre, French war vessel, now in our port, called upon tho Lord Provost on Friday to pay his respects before leaving, and to express his warm and grateful sense of the attention which he had met with during his stay in Glasgof from all the officers and officials connected with the port with whom ho had come in contact. He was anxious It should be. generally understood that he was very sensible of the admirable arrangements which had been nide for the accommodation of him ship nothing, he said, could exceed the poitebattention he had met with. " I have,' said he, " been three times round the world, and I never before experienced such cordial, kind attention; and Icould not leave, my Lord Provost, without expressing to you my obliged senae'of all {~hat has been done for us in ths port; more haslieent done for us thanif welhadbeen coun trymen of your OFD, and to your officias,L epeciall the captain of thl poyt, I tender my best thankss,"'-Gl5es

Poison.
POISON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In these days of wholesale poisoning it is a factperhaps pretty generally known to those whom it may concern that by the investment of 3d. a person may obtainz. from his " family grocer" a packet of powerful poison, sufficient to destroy the whole oS his household-dogs, cats, rats, and mice included. He my purchase it, too, without being put through any inquisitorial catechism, or undergoin any of that impertinent curiosity from the grocer whicn the law, I almost think, demands from the druggist,
The deadly poison to which I refer goes by the name oE "Battle's Vermin Killer," and in the country-probably also in London-is sold, as I have stated, by tho grocers. It is of an aspect rather uninviting, being a powder of a saty, blueish hue, and is not likely perhaps to be mistaker; for any article used in culinary operations; nevertheless, it requires no very vivid powers of fancy to imagine circumstances under which it may get into the food and stomachs of the people, they into their graves and the newspapers, society into a fit of virtuous indignation and suspicion, and an innocent person probably into a gaoL
Suppose, for instance, a woman " doing her marketing" on Saturday night. t3er coffee, sugar, tea, and butter are already in her basket, and, as she regards the pound of dips that is in transitu towards that receptacle she remembers. that last week the short sixes grew greatly shorter from. the depredations of the mice, and bethinks hersef of a packet of the " killer," as it very forcibly styles itself im, its directions for use. On the way home, on a damp and drizzly night, the " killer" and the coffee lie in fearful contact, and the paper parictes of each, moistened by the rain, suffer a breach of continuity, through which the deadly powder steals in quantities very rninute, perhaps, but sufcient to cause that woman another walk before many days-a walk behind a corpse that rests upon its heo& and its heels.
This poison, being protected only by paper, may also pos. sibly leak out into the grocer's drawers, or do its feU work i na thousand ways. I have noticed tho Action of it on two occasions, and believe that it contains a great amount of strychnine, but not being an Adept at analysis I am not sure on that point.
It is now a few weeks since I tried it the last time, on whivh occ.%on the poison was obtained from the grocer by a young boy. A small quantity of the powder -was spread upon bread and butter, and placed where it could be got at by the mice. In the morning the mice lay around it dead, and were collected and buried. But one that had escaped the search was found a fortnight after by an unhappy eat. The poor cat was hungry, and, contrary to felne custom. only iade one bite of her prey; biting the mouse through the middle, she "bolted" the halves. It is to account for the suddenness of the symptoms in the cat
thatI thus unpleasantly particularize. Afew minutes afterher meal the poor cat, while comfortably purrinn
suddenly made a spring of six feet in length, which 1 thought odd, as there was nothing to spring at; she then began playing s I thought, under my chair, and was tumbling about there for several minutes, during the course of which I remonstrated with her and reproached her with being in her second kittenhood. As she was deaf to remonstrance and reproach I picked her up, upon which she grinned at me dolefully, made a bottle-brh of her tail, crooked her fore-paws, stretched out her hind ones, made A bow of her back and tail, and of herself an example of undeniable opisthotonos. Before I could lay her down she was dead and stiff, and the extreme rigidity remained! till the next day, when she was buried.
There was onl4the one mouse in her stomach, and the process of digestion had not, to all appearance, commenced.
Let us hope that Mr. Brady will take notice of this dan. erons neihour to our sugar and out tea, and remove it rointhe vicinity of the ingredients of our gruel. It is enough for the roccr to poison us slowly by his adulteras tions; let him not intrench upon the monopoly of the drug. gist and poison us wholesale.

Garotte Attacks.
GAROTTE ATTACKS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I send for your inspection and use a new defensive instrument called "tho highway protector." From its construction and weight it has the property of instantly disabling the enemy in whatever position he makesthe attack, being, in fact, two weapons-viz., a knuckleduster for striking forward, and a dirk (unobserved until required) for striking backwards or sideways. Being looked firmly together and buckled on the wearer makes it superior to al
other weapons, as it cannot be wrested away or let go in a struggle. The anti-garotte glove that has been noticed so much does not so effectually disable at a blow as this weapon, and has the inconvenient tendency of fastening or hooking the enemy's clothes, thereby depriving the user from aaministerig more than one blow, to say nothing of the faDacy of depending entirely upon the clutoh of two or threefingersfor its totaleffect,-athing, indeed, thatyoucan. not at alldependupon on a cold or wet night. If a man holds one of the wearers of the anti-garotte glove firmly by the wrist he is eflectually prevented from doing any mischief, and would cut a decidedly unenviable figure in the presence of two stout men; but with this weapon the dirk is so adjusted with respect to length that very little wriggling by the user would make it penetrate the antagonistie wrist joint, and make him let go quiekly,-an advantage that, of course, would be followed up by a blow with the knuckleduster,-au effect likely to produce much pain and surprise,
Yours obedientlv.

A GOOD BARGAIN.-The ship Adriatic, of New
A GOOD BAIioAnT.-The ship Adriatic, of Nevo York, lately stranded offDungarvon, was towved into Queens. town on Sunday, by two powerful steam tugs. The Cork
cpo7tc- says :-" She vas purchased, together with her cargo, atnauction, wre uderstand, by the Messrs. Scott, of Queenstown, for 1,5101., and is considered a great bargain.. The Adriatic is comparatively a newr ship, being little more than five months off the stocks of the famnous builders, Donald 'Kay and Co., of Boston. Shels 2,000 tonsburden. Her cabms are beautifully finished, being p.nnelled in mahogany and rosewood. The perfection w,ith which she was finished was proved by the fact that, though imbedded for some weeLsr itho sand, the water nevor reached her cabin. When the Adriati shall have been thoroughly new. rigged and repaired, it is estimated that she will be worth
DE n (SrEE x) Por.-We have received from a practitoner at Chelsea a letter 9uestioningthe necessity or possibility of abolishing the keeping of cows in London, as recently advocatod in our columns. His arguments fairly represent those usualUy dted by the defenders of this practice. He represents that " the milk brought by railway in hot weather is often converted into butter by the shaking, or otherwise spoilt by being milked the evening before." The damage thus done cannot be very extensive, for it is estimated that in 1853 the quantity of milk brought by railway to London considerably exceeded 3,000,000 quarts. In Paris where nearly all the milk comes from long distances (often 70 or 100 miles), upwards of 16,000 gallons daily arrive by one railway; yet during eight months of the year only about 5 per cent..
ud durig the four hot months less than 15 per oent., o m sustains any injury, and even this is employed for the manufacture of cheese. The effect of thus obtaining the Parisian supply from the provinces has been to diminish instead of increase the price of milk. In London, on thea other hand, the profits on its sale are excessive. Betweexi the deliveryof the milk by the farmer and its consumptioir by the London customer a profit ccrues to the dealers of nearly 50 per cent. Alhlwing, therefore, the same amount of loss as in Paris, there weo stldl remain a fair margin of profit, In Pars a fwgrains ofsoda are usuallyadded to each gallon of the mik, to preserve it from acidity-a practice entirely nobjectionable. But when the rogue is detected! diluting the mnilk with water be is justly considered to be gult7 Of a fraud, and is punished by th ifiiction of a fines varying from 26f. to 50f. The wholrgeent, however as to the railway conveyance of niiLk1g~beside the question What wre urge, en sanitary grounds, is the necessity of preo venting cowkeers in London from huddl'ng together mtoc badly paved and ill-ventiated sheds as many cows as can be: got into them, the ordure being suffered to remain or only cleared away at the convenience of the cowkeeper; the poor" beastiesa being kept at milk for two or three sews, anti fed upon browers' grains and other unfitting food. Inder proper restrictions and in suitable neighbourhoods a few animals night be permitted to remain for the supply of invalids. But, as cows are kept irL London at present, ib seems a doubt whether the milkthey supply does not some. times generate disease, insteadof xupplying healthy nourish. ment,-Th Lanca,
